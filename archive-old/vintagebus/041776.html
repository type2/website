&gt; I checked the archives and have seen tons of posts on
&gt; this subject.  I found the correct size and brand,
&gt; called some places.  Not in stock, not made anymore.
&gt; &lt;/disclaimer&gt;

What they're really saying is that, if they don't have it in stock, they
don't want to order it.  Sometimes it's pure laziness, sometimes they just
don't know how and don't want to bug the boss to learn how.  90% of the
time they can talk the customer into buying something from off the shelf
anyway.

&gt; So, I called around to a few more places, explaining
&gt; *exactly* what I needed, and most told me nope, sorry,
&gt; don't have nuthin' for one of those hippie buses. 
&gt; Argh!  

Frustrating, isn't it!

&gt; I called my friends at the Tire Rack...
&gt; Bridgestone 603V, 8 ply load range D.  She told me
&gt; that this was a pretty nice tire.  Price? $373.38 USD
&gt; for 5.  Then I called around to see how much mounting,
&gt; etc. would be if I brought my own tires in.  Most
&gt; places will charge me between $15-$25/tire.

I have a feeling that Wendy would call any tire a &quot;pretty nice tire&quot; :)
that price sounds reasonable, and I know from personal experience that the
tires are good.

&gt; Then I called up the local Bridgestone/Firestone place
&gt; - couldn't find them when I gave him the exact
&gt; Bridgestone part number.  

did you put the &quot;RD&quot; in front of it, as in &quot;RD603V&quot;?  Sometimes computers,
nice as they are, miss the part if one character is missing.

&gt; Hmmm, so I explained what I
&gt; needed and voila! he found the mysterious 603V.  Price
&gt; was $472.60 USD for 5, mounted, etc.  For another 5
&gt; bucks each, I can get road hazard insurance.  So, for
&gt; a little under $500, I can get 5 new tires, that fit,
&gt; and have road hazard.  Seems pretty good to me.

I'd skip the road hazard.  It's insurance you don't need unless you have a
strong tendancy to run over junk on the highway.  Sounds to me as if the
Tire rack deal is a bit better if it includes shipping, but if it were me
I'd go with the local dealer.  Keep the pump primed, as it were.  If
there's a problem, then there's only one way to point the finger as well!

I've heard a rumor (also from a tire man) that some vehicles in the U-Haul
fleet take our rare tire size.  Anyone else hear this?
