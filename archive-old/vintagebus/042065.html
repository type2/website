&gt; I really hesitated to write this because I just KNOW I'll sound like a

&gt; I'm constantly wrong about things) to think that it seems like the notion that
&gt; sparkplugs need improved contact with the aluminum head is like killing a flea
&gt; with an ax?

It is.

&gt;  I figure that the (stock) coil puts out about 15,000 volts which
&gt; is sufficient to LEAP from one piece of metal to the other, hence the
&gt; operation of the node end of a SPARK plug.  So I figure that there is nothing
&gt; to gain to try to improve the connection at the threads.  (There should be at
&gt; least *one* area of the threads that has contact with the aluminum - but even
&gt; that shouldn't matter, I wouldn't think.  If there was the condition that
&gt; there is &quot;no good contact at *any* of the threads&quot;, a spark could leap the 1
&gt; micron {or so} distance.)  I know the only way that a spark could not leap
&gt; this small distance is if there is a dielectric there in the gap.  Is aluminum
&gt; oxide, which is a bad conductor, sufficient to stop or even slow a high
&gt; voltage like this?

No, the aluminum oxide is probably wiped away by the pressure of the
threads and the washer, but even at that it wouldn't stop the spark.

&gt; How would antiseize compound improve this situation if it
&gt; is just on top of the corrosion?  (Mind you I always use antiseize compound on
&gt; spark plugs for reasons other than conductivity.)

Good.  Anti-sieze is exactly that.  Keeps the threads from sticking.

&gt; I can't remember who wrote about this - my intention is to just have a
&gt; clarification on this.  It seems to come up often.  Any input on what I might
&gt; be missing would surely be helpful.  Thanks in advance!  Flames welcome.

A conductive paste is of use when trying to make an electrical path
between two hard-to-connect materials.  If you connect copper and
aluminum, for example, you must exclude air and moisture from the joint or
you will invite corrosion and a bad connection.  At low voltages this is
important, but on the high-tension side of the coil the spark will jump!
