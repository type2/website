&gt; Does anyone have any leads on where I could getdimensions of the cabinets
&gt; and front-rear facing seat for a non-walk
&gt;
&gt;

Boy are you in luck.  Everett has just what you need on his site, since he
has a complete SO-42 manual there WITH dimensions of all the parts.  I
assume you are referring to late'64-'67 camper interiors since you used the
term Z-bed.  Here is the link.

The manual shows what a walk through and a non walk through should look
like.  Very informative!

Thanks Everett!
