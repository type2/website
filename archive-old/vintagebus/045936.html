 My 67 has an after market emblem with threaded studs that fasten with wing 
nuts.
 I used a wire grommet in the hole to help seal out the rain
 
 My 63 has the original emblem with non threaded studs. I've used a small 
piece
 of fuel line to fasten it.  But this week I ordered the emblem clips from
 Wolfsburg West, however they don't carry or reproduce the seals, I know that
 there were seals of some sort because remnants still remain stuck in the 
yellow
 paint. 
 
 what have other people done to deal with this and don't tell me roofing tar.
 
 for those that live in arid climates and don't know what rain is or what 
window
 wipers are for pmail me back and I'll send you a photo
  &gt;&gt;
what's wrong with roofing tar?

anyway, take a piece of fuel line and cut a small sliver off it-maybe a mm 
thick. you now have a flat circle grommet.  make four of the same thickness, 
push them onto  the studs, put emblem on bus- it will not scrape the paint 
now.
