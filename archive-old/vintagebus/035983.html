&lt;&lt;  am
 not a fan of the local Maaco respray alternative.  (to kill the thread before
 it starts, I will admit: some Maaco's aren't that bad, my local one just
isn't
 going to work for me.)     &gt;&gt;
  I worked for Maaco for a total of two hours-the horrors I saw.  I should
have known something was up when I was hired.  When they ask me if I could
sculpt!
    Peace, Love, and ought oh-don't go to Maaco,
        Mr. Bubble Head
