Um, no.  You should use exactly three shims...no more, no less.  There is a
technical reason for using exactly three (I think it has to do with the
rotation), but VW clearly states that you should always use three shims.

Your message implies that you have no shims in place now.  If not, then
there should be no problem with the shims which are available in a multitude
of thicknesses.  You should avoid having several shims and rely instead on
one or two to get it correct.  Shims aren't a band aid they are the way it's
done to reasonably adjust end play.  Check Wilsons rebuild book.  I think he
discussed shims in it.  Good luck.   

 Well I checked the end play and the dial 
indicator tells me that I have between .007&quot; and .008&quot; of play.  Bentley 
says that it should be within 003&quot; and .005&quot; with a wear limit of 
.006&quot;.  What should I do?  Should I tear the beast back down again and 
get the shortblock rebuilt or should I just shim it?  If I were to shim 
it how long may I expect it to last?  I realize its just a band aid, but 
I want to drive my bus, but yet I don't want the thought of that looming 
over my head, unless it really isn't that bad.  The engine ran wonderful 
before I took it out, but I got that washer in the #1 cyl some how when 
I was replacing PR tube seals just after I got back from BNNTA last fall 
and I thought I would just &quot;freshen&quot; it up.
