&lt;&lt; someone told me that he thinks I have a bad bearing. I really had a tough 
time getting a bearing out of a reduction box - I broke two bearing pullers, 
one I bought - cheap piece o' crap and the other I rented - another cheap 
piece o' crap.  Anyway, I did get it out but I broke it and it came out in 
pieces - sh*t.  Anyway, what is the deal on these things, the idiot book 
makes it seem fairly easy - I surely do -hope the other side is easier - it 
took me a 1.5 days to get that first one out - ok, lots of breaks but still 
......&gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
You really need to Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67.  
The idiot manual just does not cut it.
Do not just stop with the one lower outer bearing keep taking it apart until 
you have all four per side out.  Best way to get off the outer lower for 
1955-63 RGBs is to remove the drum, then outer lower bearing cover four 
bolts, undo the brake line to the wheel cylinder and pull off the backing 
plate with all of the brakes system off as one unit.  Take a 17mm allen 
wrench or socket and make sure both the drain and fill plugs are loosened 
slightly and drain the oil out.  Remove the RGB half bolts.  Then use a 
hammer on the side of the 17mm allen wrench or socket to push the outer half 
of the RGB outward and at the same time slide off the outer lower bearing.  
We lightly polish with 400+ wet dry sandpaper the area this bearing rides on 
the stub axle to allow a little easier installation/removal later.
 
&lt;&lt;So, I'm hoping that I can replace the gaskets under the side covers of my 
transmission - I'm starting to get the idea that it may not be as straight 
forward as I originally thought.  Will I need any special tools for this?&gt;&gt;
You will need a very large C-clip compresson tool (Got our from Proto), and 
remove the engine and tranny.
 
&lt;&lt;Also there is an oil seal inside of the cover that houses the bearing in 
the brake backing plate - I cannot get this out - it seems to be ..... glued 
maybe?  So what's the deal on those things?  Shouldn't they just pop out?&gt;&gt;
You have to press the axle seal out of the bearing covers toward the inward 
direction as when it is mounted in the VW.
 
&lt;&lt; I was going on a long trip and I wanted someone to fix my axle boot leak 
(I tried a few times and it still leaked).  So, they took my bus and turned 
the axle boots such that the bolts where on the top and they told my that my 
transmission was losing oil around the side covers.  I noticed to today when 
I took my boots off that there was
 actually a big hole in one - right at the bottom - they turned it so it 
would leak!  (I doubt it was the ol' german guy that actually did the work) 
These boots are less than a year old! What's the deal on those things! Also, 
they don't seem to fit exactly right - my bus is a 60. &gt;&gt;
We have been hearing the quality of the rubber used lately for these has 
dropped drasticly.  Still good or bad rubber you have to push/compress the 
boot together slightly toward the tranny to give the material of the boot 
slack to work properly without ripping when the axle goes to maximum up or 
down position.  Kind of like being a wise thing not to do the splits in tight 
jeans!  Eric&amp;Barb
