Subject: Re: [VB] CA license plate issue, AB2058

my single cab wore a calif. blue plate when i bought it.  it was registered non-operational.  when i went in to dmv to transfer title and register it, they tried to give me new white plates.  i asked if i couldn't keep the blue plates and the woman asked if i had both.  i'd come in with one and affirmed that my truck had both.  she said that as i had both and because the registration had the same plate numbers that i could register them to my truck.  she did have trouble getting the computer to accept the plates and finally had to photocopy the one i brought in and send the copy to headquarters.  my truck has a november tag but i was issued a january tag after i registered it.  my sunroof registration is due in november and it would have been nice to have the truck due then too.  i asked about the january date and no one seemed to know why.  my convertible has plates that're black with gold lettering.  today when i was at dmv i asked if i could register it to those plates.  the manager of the dmv i went to said that so long as i had paperwork or registration papers that showed those plates, all would be good.  i suggest that you go back to your dmv and try someone else.
