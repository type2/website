&lt;&lt; well... for what its worth..
i just bought a 62 very original standard.  its turquoise and white
exterior, with an all turquoise interior that is only missing the middle
seat.  upholstery is great and the headliner is still in there and all
of the panels look as if they have never been removed...which they
probably haven't.  the bus was converted to 12V years ago by a vw shop i
believe...i'd have to look at the receipts.  still has all of its
original rims...but it does have a new 1600 with 8K on it. there is a
dent on the lower part of the nose and a little one on one of the rear
corners...but thats all.  only rust is a blister in each of the rockers
(small) and one blister above the drivers wheel well...thats it.
the bus has 208K miles on it as it was driven cross country many times
without troubles.  original tranny...but it shifts and drives like new.
no funny sounds.  maintained religiousely by shops around the
country...has all receipts.  the lady has owned it for the past 20
years....even has the newspaper clipping from when she bought it.  never
driven in salt :) it still has the toolkit and owners manual too.

and what did i pay for this beast?  $2500. thats it.  (its still a lot
of dough to scrounge up when you're 16!)

I think thats more than fair given the west coast prices...and since i
live in the rust belt...its quite the deal.

so lesson being...there are still nice unmolested buses out there if you
look for em...even though i didn't have to look...it popped up in my
face :)  and this is even in the town that I live in...a mile or so away
from me!  can't get a better deal than that.

now...maybe I'll lower it...tint the windows... put some curb feelers on
it (like those jimmy?? :-)  and put an enourmous stereo in it....or a
camper interior..........

or...maybe not 8)

have a good day everyone
