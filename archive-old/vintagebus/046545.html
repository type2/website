&lt;&lt; Also---did anyone else have trouble getting a tire place w/ the 
 right equipment to balance wide five rims? I had to go to a really old time 
 shop about fifteen miles away that only carried Firestone, but I'm happy I 
 found them as I'm very happy!

In the past I had to get an adapter and attach it to the wheel to get 
balanced. Not since I moved to the bus/bug filled eugene spfld area though.
