Subject: High Country Bus Festival T shirt orders due Now
Message-ID: &lt;25284f2d.24a55950_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Micheal asked me to post to the lists. He really needs to have your shirt 
order in very soon. Anyone who has done this before knows what a PIA it is to 
try to figure how many to order.
Do not be confused by the address. His heart is still in the mountains of 
North Carolina, and he will be there. :-)

The info is at:

There is a link to the T-shirt order form.

Pry for Peace,
