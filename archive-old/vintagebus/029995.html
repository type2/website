&gt; M-tag lists the SO23 westy kit as J23. What does J stand for? Does anyone
&gt; have a list of what A23, B23 etc, meant?



Well, at least on SO42 Westfalia campers, the A, B &amp; C denotes different
optional equipment packages.  I forget exactly which was which at the moment,
but  one was for a hard top with no tent or rack.  Another was for a pop top
with no tent or rack, and the third was with the pop top and the tent and
rack.  Check out the Split Screen Van club/Bulli Kartei and NEATO specs
booklet.  That's where I remember reading it.  Not sure if the same thing on
the earlier Westies though.
