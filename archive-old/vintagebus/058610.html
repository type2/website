Subject: Body work tool

I started on a new project recently (62 dd) and have decided it is time to
by a new tool for bodywork. What I am planning on getting is a stud welder
for pulling dents. Does anyone on the list have any experience with these
and/or can suggest ones to go with or ones to stay away from?
I have seen the H$S 4500 gun model for $170 what is the opinion on this one?
Thanks in advance
