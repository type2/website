&lt;&lt; Any chance you could lead me to the purchase of one rear axle reduction 
box from a '64 to '67 type 2 ? Just need the reduction box and the innards, 
not
 the axel and such heading to the tranny. Thanks. &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Do you mean you need only the outer half of the reduction or do you also need 
the inner half and the axle tube it is pressed onto?  The outer half is an 
either side part, while the inner half is left or right only.  Eric&amp;Barb
