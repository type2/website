So, on the trip to Calgary it was raining really, really hard in Southern
Saskatchewan so I turned on the headlights.  After a period of time smoke
started billowing out from under the dash.  I quickly pulled over and
disconnected my plug in  cooler and turned off the 8-track and pulled the
key out.  After looking under the dash I noticed a blue wire that was
cooked.  The casing was melted really badly.  Everything else seemd to work
OK so I carried on my trip.

Once I got to Calgary, I was driving past a parts chain store and figured I
would see if they had GL-4, which they didn't, and  a wire to replace the
burned wire.  A very friendly transvestite was working at the counter and
when I explained my problem and that my bus was converted to 12 volt she/he
said that I needed a relay (don't even think about that pun.)   Anyway, I
passed on the relay and bought some heavier gage wire.  In my ignorance I
figured that I now have four lights at 12 volts where originally there was
only 4 lights at 6 volts.  I figured that I only needed a heavier gage wire.

When I got back to my camp site and took out the front panel I noticed that
the blue wire from the head light switch went directly to the driver's side
headlight without passing through the fuse box.  Is that right?
The switch (which I suspect if from a different VW)  was wired as follows:

2 reds to
1 grey to 58
1 white with black stripe to 56
1 grey with red stripe to 58b
1 BLUE and 1 grey with black stripe to 57

I also noticed that the headlight didn't have the proper seal between it and
the body but was sealed with teflon tape (I did that, I was just too
impatient to wait for the proper one.)

Inside of the headlight bucket I noticed that one of the other wires was
melted through due to contact with the blue that had melted.  So I taped
over the exposed parts of the wire.  Then I took out the headlight switch
and cleaned it really well and replaced the melted blue with the heavier
gage wire.  I reassembled everything and when I tested it nothing worked and
the headlight switch seized up, when I took it apart a second time I could
see that the switch parts had fused together

I suspect that there is a short somewhere but does that sound right? .....
How about that blue wire, should it be going through the fuse box?
