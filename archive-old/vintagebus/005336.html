1965 kombi/ camper  $200
I bought this bus thinking I’d cut body panels out to repair my 66 dlux, but
I would rather see someone rescue it.
 It sat under trees w/ out windshield glass for a while so it has some rust
in the center of the cab floor. The nose was hit but could be straightened.
And a previous owner cut the divider from behind the front seats, and added
some camper equip.
  but it has a nice headliner, rust free rockers and rear corners (except
for a small spot where the batt. Tray meets the body) the dog legs and cab
floor inboard  have surface rust only.
    It need  windshield glass and 1 pop out, (I have a spare)
  It does not have a motor, (I towed it to my house) and I don’t know about
the transaxle .
 I can’t bring myself to cut it up, you can save this bus!!
This bus is located in Olympia WA. I have a tow dolly to lone if needed
if I sell it I’ll buy replacement panels or I’ll trade for panels for part
of the payment
  ps I have a &quot;Z&quot; bed I’ll throw in for an extra $75
