Subject: Double Cab Lead

Looking at the bed of my truck, I was struck by fact that there is a
bead of what looks like gray lead in the form of a cross.  It runs down
the center line of the bed and then a second bead crosses perpendicular
to that from side to side.  It looks to me like this is a seam.  Is this
right?  Is the bed made up of sections that they joined together at the
factory?.  These seems run between the ribs.  I've never looked that
close at a truck before.  Thanks.

Steve
