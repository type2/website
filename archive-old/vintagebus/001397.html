&gt; Shift bushing bolt wire, that is!
&gt; I had spent many hours &quot;Weddling&quot; my tranny not so long ago, and recently
I
&gt; got around to replacing the plastic bushings under the cab floor that the
&gt; shifter rides in. Regreased everything, tightened it all down etcetc. Took
&gt; it for a test drive, and it was GREAT. For a block or so. THEN it
developed
&gt; a nasty habit of NOT going in to first, but prefering third - made people
&gt; behind me at lights VERY angry :P
&gt; Well, it stumped me for a week, led me to not drive the bus unless an
&gt; emergency, in general snarl at people...
&gt; finally crawled back under the bus and started over. While I had tightened
&gt; down the odd square-head bolt that holds the rodbushing to
&gt; the rear shift lever, it had worked itself     j  u  s  t      loose
enough
&gt; to allow the bushing to turn with OUT turning the tranny rod behind it.
&gt; This prevented the levers inside the tranny nose from properly aligning,
&gt; leading to that 'brick wall' feeling. I had a few people tell me to 'just
&gt; make sure its tight' and forego the baling wire. DON'T. I took some wire,
&gt; looped it around the bushing, threading the wire thru the lil bolt and
then
&gt; twisting it together (the book tells you to make sure you twist it in the
&gt; &gt;proper&lt;  direction, so that it adds tension to the bolt, instead of
&gt; loosening it some). There is a small positioning divot in the shift rod
&gt; coming out of the tranny; make sure the bolt is in there :)
&gt;
&gt; I now have a snappy little shifter lever up front! TIGHT, crisp and firm
&gt; pattern, with no stubborn gears or accidental Reverse instead of Second
&gt; wonkiness. It literally is like driving a different bus - previously, I
&gt; could swat the shifter around in a good foot-wide circle before finding a
&gt; gear some days!
&gt;
&gt; Moral of the story? A) No excuse for sloppy shifting... cost me less than
&gt; $100   and B) no matter what the procedure you run, if it didn't work
START
&gt; AGAIN and check everything twice. Its usually sumpin stoopit.
&gt; ......................like my bus not running at all last week, and Lewis
&gt; came over and said &quot;did ya check the timing?&quot; Well, of course I had.
&gt;
&gt; I'd set it at zero, however :P
