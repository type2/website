The big red light on the dash is for the emergency flashers and I believe

that it is a one year only item for '64.

yes for emergency flashers, used 63-65, but is not on all 63s or 64s I think.
Unplug the wire in back and uncrew the thingy around the light holder to
remove.  Tends to be stuck, it was really hard to get the one off Nellie's
dash (my 65).   I had tried to get it out before, as the lens was cracked and
I wanted to replace it, but it wouldn't budge But I removed it later to paint
the dash.   I think it looks cool when it glows in the dark.   

oh- I think I forgot to talk about pointy edged/round edges pod in my post on
dashes/noses.  I noticed someone else did .  :)   That change was in  61 or 62
, so his 66 wants a roundy edged pod.
