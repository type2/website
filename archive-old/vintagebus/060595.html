Subject: Re: [VB] correct oil bath for '64-now 67preheat

For the late 66/and 67 pre heat the 1&quot; tube does go forward on the right hand 
side- so yes the front tine does have a hole in it for the tube to go 
through, and the heater box does have an spout for the hose to go on.   This 
means the heat is actually pumped by the fan through the heater box and into 
the preheat- which sounds a good system to me.

A bunch of heater boxes I found have the 1&quot; outlets on them, both left and 
rights. Some have caps on the spouts, like that has never been used.

 I've read before about the '67 air cleaner pre-heat hose running forward
 through the front tin to the heat exchanger, but I remain unclear on what is
 exactly meant. (My '67 has a '73 beetle 1600DP in it right now.)
 
 Does the hose (1)actually run to the heat exchanger itself, which must have
 a non-standard port on it for the hose to connect to? In other words, does
 it actually take warmed fresh air from inside the heat exchanger? OR does it
 (2)run forward and connect to an intake pipe that bolts to the heat
 exchanger and is in the engine-cooling airflow? In either case, the front
 (FIF) tin must have a 1-inch hole in its right side, making it different
 from other years. And, in Case #1, the heat exchanger must also be a unique
 design for this year, so where does one get a suitable replacement?
