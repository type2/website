Thanks for the input,I had a feeling that WCC had the best panels but its
hard to buy something  
without seeing it.I have talked to Lenny and were trying to figure out how
to ship them. At this
point in the project trying to save a few hundred dollars for something I
won't be happy with seems
silly.It's only money !.By the way the M codes are this, I have no idea
what they mean any input ?
