&gt; I don't think so.  Of course I could be totally wrong but I think the Binz is
&gt; actually undervalued right now.

Well, you have a vested interest in the escalating value of Binz crew cabs, just
like the owners of Hebmullers do, or for that matter the owners of any kind of
VW or car they are speculating on. That's cool....if you're going to sell it
when it hits 40K, (if it ever does) congratulations. If someone buys it for the
speculation of its future value, fine, just don't be surprised when others feel
contrary.

Look, I'm a certified cheep skate.  That said, I like double cabs...I have one.
I think Binz's are really cool.  I just think 15 thousand dollars for a project
(that BTW you'd have to put another 15 into to get anywhere near a 30-40K price
tag) is too much.  How much was the bucket truck Charlie H. purchased last
year.  How many of those are in the U.S.??

If you really want to make 70K do some dollar cost averaging with some good
mutual funds and enjoy the miracle of compound interest.

This is just my personal opinion, of course.  I hope they do go &quot;through the
roof&quot; for your sake.  It just makes the whole hobby more expensive when things
sky rocket.
