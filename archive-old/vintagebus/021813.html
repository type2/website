Hi all-

A few weeks ago I wrote a rescue story on a 62 &quot;westy?&quot; camper that a friend
picked up.   I considered buying it, unseen, based on what I was told.  It was
located about 5 hours from here, but close to where I will be moving soon.
Anyways, billy ended up bringing it home yesterday and I got a chance to look
at it.  I now do not think it is a westy based on the stuff inside.  It came
with original safaries, tent poles (no tent), and a real westy rack (has tag).
It has a submarine hatch.  The interior is all white (and I mean ALL white)
formica which is what makes me think it is not a westy based on what I have
seen in the past.  No tags or other info to tell us what it is.  It is wierd.
The whole interior middle to front makes into a bed.  No cab dividers to speak
of (im speaking of the metal that usually goes behind the seats in a walkthru
or bench).  The front bench seat back swivels and/or removes making the bed
which goes all the way up to the steering wheel.  The back area has a somewhat
narrow isle with cabinets on eiter side.  The refer is on the drivers side
located in the middle back.  The very back drivers side has a cabinet that
swivels and slides inward to access where the spare tire goes like whre it is
in  my 21 window.  This is really different.   Underneath the light blue
upholstery covering everying, is the usual plaid green/brown, etc. fabric.
I threw out a guess that maybe it was a american made camper.   What is it???
