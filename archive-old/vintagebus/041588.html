&gt; &lt;&lt; I wouldn't get too excited over the use of aircraft aluminum for these.
&gt;  It's one of the most easily available sources of suitable tubing. &gt;&gt;

&gt; It is rod not tubing.  Tubing is much weaker than rod and I wanted to make my

&gt; This is not necessarily directed at the last person to post but after reading 
&gt; several responses to my original post I am very curious why so many people 
&gt; **WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN MY REPRODUCTION OR TALKED TO ME ABOUT THEM** have so 
&gt; much to say about them.  No, 6061 aluminum alone isn't all that exciting.  
&gt; But if I had used some crap material and the extension broke on some listee 
&gt; at an inopportune moment then there would be some excitement - the negative 
&gt; kind. 
...

To clarify, I did not comment on the quality of these shifter extensions,
which I assume is excellent.

What I was attempting to get across is that many folks advertise that
their parts are made of &quot;aircraft aluminum&quot; and bandy about the grade
numbers as if this somehow made that parts better.  Unless you happen to
know what the grade numbers mean, all you really know is that the part is
made of aluminum.  The range of strengths is tremendous, and you don't
always want the strongest material, because the strongest is also the most
fatigue-prone.

I didn't mean to offend, just to educate.
