I  was told by the list sometime back, that singlecabs never came with rear
view mirrors....?
my 57 SC has holes but it was PO installed ..those nuts just done look right
on the OUTSIDE of the bus.. *sigh*

57 sc




&gt;My SC didn't originally come with an inside mirror. There were no holes.
&gt;
&gt;Outside mirrors were part of the dealer prep. On Commercials, who would
have
&gt;installed the inside mirror? The dealer? A special obscure M-code? Q
branch?
