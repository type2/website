&lt;&lt; Does anyone know of a source for information on Sapphire Radios.  
 Specifically for a 67 westy. Assuming of course that it even came with one.  
 I found a Sapphire III. It is a six volt and obviously too old. &gt;&gt;
Hi Boyd,
The Sapphire III &amp; IV were for the 1966-67 VWs.  The dealerships would 
install a resistor for the 6 volt models to install into the 12 volt VWs 
until the 6 volt stocks were used up.   Eric&amp;Barb
