&gt; Yes, it's a law, although that guy is from NorCal.
&gt; 
&gt; Last time I was in SoCal with my Bus, the Police stopped me and asked why my Bus was so tall and was it possibly unsafe at that height?  I explained that I was from AZ and that we don't have paved roads so I was forced to leave my Bus at the dangerous stock height and that I would be leaving SoCal as soon as possible.  ;)

Well, most of the buses around my corner of SoCal are stock height
(including mine).  If you go to the shows you'll see the lowered ones.
