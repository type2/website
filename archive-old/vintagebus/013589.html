$200 teardrop trailer FS
At least that is what the ad in the paper said. Last
weekend I cruised the classifieds over a bleary cup of
early Saturday AM coffee prior to a mandatory
neighborhood garage sale. Didnt have much time to
waste so I quickly made the call. Left the message and
checked back often through out the morning. It was a
given that it was sold at 4:30 AM. I would never hear
back from the seller. Surprisingly, I got the call
from the seller and soon had a solid deal over the
phone! A clear title was confirmed. Is it all
aluminum? Good! does it have a smallish wooden
interior? Is there a small stove and kitchen in the
rear? Excellent? Is it in good enough condition to be
hauled away? Good! I would bring cash and be *right*
over. Inch and seven-eighths? Perfect! =) Hopped in
Paula's Westy and hauled to the outter suburbs of the
Eastern metro area. Yahoo, a trailer score!
Arrived at the location and was invited into the
seller's backyard. Admired the Harley and avoided the
dog. In an instant I realized that the seller didn't
know what a teardrop trailer really was. In the middle
of the yard sat a sorry battered example of a Ricky
Ricardo style 1957 Shasta-like flat sided &quot;egg&quot;
profile 14 foot beastie. Aluminum, I suppose, under
faded paint on the outside and wood on the inside.
&quot;Oh!, sorry man, I just let the ol' lady place the ad.
I dunno what words she used.&quot; I thanked him for his
time and suggested that he clarify the type of trailer
to the other potential buyers. Poof!, buzzkill and a
long drive home. Have heard of others driving much
farther to share in similar experiences. At least the
Harley and it's owner were nice. Sometimes things
*almost* work out...
