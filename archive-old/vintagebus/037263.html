&lt;&lt; Good point!
 I bought a $9 item...the seller is going to charge me $4 to ship it
 priority!!!!!!!!!  Better day on that.  Send it cheapo or don't bother. &gt;&gt;

One of the benefits to the seller with priority mail is the post office 
supplies the boxes for free.  If you are shipping a lot of things not having 
to find boxes is a huge consideration
