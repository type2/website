Subject: Re: [VB] Speaker Q

I put a 4&quot; speaker in the original speaker bracket behind the dash. My CD player is (was, dan leaky safari's!) mounted under the dash and I have two 6x9's in speaker boxes inside the rear westy floor cabinet. No holes drilled and a little sneaky. I don't need to advertise a reason for crooks to break in!

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
