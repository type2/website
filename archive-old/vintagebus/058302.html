&gt; Yes it was strange.  Berg might have made a mistake and sent the wrong tin 
&gt; although I don't think so.  The way I think they wanted it to fit is that 
&gt; their primary piece that is riveted on has ~1/4&quot; extra on the top right and 
&gt; front right (sides adjacent to the exhaust shell) that are tapered down on 
&gt; the top and towards the shroud on the vertical edge.  The lip on the 
&gt; exhaust shell has been bent in such a way that I think the idea is to let 
&gt; it overlap the cooler cover while still fitting the stock exit duct.  
&gt; Unfortunately this didn't work.

Hi Thomas,
That does not sound good.

&gt; Skip forward to Sunday:  I found some tin at Kelley park and, having been
&gt; immersed in the VW show atmosphere all day, became rejuvenated and vowed to
&gt; get this done.  I remember the article in Hot VWs but not the exact details 
&gt; and my copy is in storage.  However I did get some great insight from your 
&gt; comments on the sheet metal mods as well as the pictures on P&amp;C's site.  I 
&gt; decided to try a different approach that would minimize the welding 
&gt; required and used two of each piece to be modified.  For the sacrificial 
&gt; piece I used tin that had some damage and for the Hoover bit I used one 
&gt; that was broken.
&gt; I found that the extension needed to be 7/8&quot; so I just cut one piece in a 
&gt; convenient location and the second piece with 7/8&quot; more material.  With 
&gt; that done I got them welded together today.  There was some warping but I 
&gt; managed to get them to line up and only need to add the foam strips and it 
&gt; will be done.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that you modified the exhaust shell in such a way that you could 
&gt; still use the stock exit duct.  That's pretty cool.  I also like the 
&gt; treatment to the shroud on the lower cooler feed side where it would meet 
&gt; the Hoover bit (something the Berg tin doesn't address).  Can you tell me 
&gt; why there's so much weld there?  Is that a repair in addition to the 
&gt; extension or something else like reshaping the supply duct there?
&gt; 
When you extend the tin wider you have to weld in new sealing surfaces.

&gt; Another idea of yours that I used was the Hoover Bit reinforcement.  I used 
&gt; 1/8&quot; square stock cut to length and bent 90 degrees then welded to the 
&gt; underside of the bit. I have attached some pics of my modified tin.  There 
&gt; are a couple of additions I want to make like the treatment to the exhaust 
&gt; shell in the corner where air could escape.  Anyway thanks for all your 
&gt; help on this one!  Regards,  
&gt; Thomas

Glad we could help!
