&gt;Now lets see, where is that bus content. . . oh yeah, I cannot find
&gt;reverse in my 65. Once in a while I can get it: the rest of the time I
&gt;try and try and can't find it. All other gears seem good. Linkage??


More than likely. Your front bushing on the shift rod and the shifter
linkage on the floor are probably the culprits, cause it's probably the
rotation part that's not being transmitted to the shift forks. Take the two
bolts off the shifter base and lift that sucker out to see whether you got
anything left in there. It'll probably be worn to a nubbin'.
