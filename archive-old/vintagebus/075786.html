&gt;   Sounds like the same thing that happened to me on the way to the Classic
&gt; this year. I started to loose number 2 exhaust valve. I had to stop every 50
&gt; to 100 miles to readjust it, finally took the roller tip adjuster off and
&gt; put in a regular screw and got more miles out of it, made it 500 miles that
&gt; weekend till there was no more valve adjustment left. Am pulling the engine
&gt; tomorrow to pull the head to get it fixed so I can drive to Familian Fest
&gt; this weekend.
