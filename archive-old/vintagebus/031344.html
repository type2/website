&gt;A few month back I picked up a full length middle seat for my bus, but
since then have come to learn that a walk through should of had a 3/4 sea=
t,
is this really true? my bus has the extra key ways in the floor for a ful=
l
length seat but they are screwed in brackets not welded on ones.
&gt;
Yes, most walk-thrus had a 2/3 middle seat but you can just check the flo=
or
mounts to see what is proper or check the holes in your original cargo fl=
oor
rubber mat, if you still have it.  Real floor mounts are welded-in, as yo=
u
indicated.

The 62-63 2/3 middle seat is fairly difficult to find, although you could=

always fake it by using a 64-65 seat and switching the grab handles.

I also have a full-length 62-63 seat that I would trade for a short one..=
.

'67 seats have the kicked-out leg near the cargo doors.  '66 had this too=
?
 I'm not sure on that.
