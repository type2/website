Subject: RE:transporter restoration books

Alice,

I don't know of any indepth books on restoration but &quot;VW Bus Custom 
Handbook&quot; by Laurence Meredith has a overview of what you need to do to get 
a bus back in shape.  He goes through the body work and mechanical but I 
would only use this book as a outline.  Read online or in other books about 
each specific process unless you know how to do it already.  There are lots 
of helpful pictures and a nice amount of bus history.  Good book for a bus 
lover.

Hope that helps,

Kurt Lundquist
