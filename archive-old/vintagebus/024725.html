Sorry, Thom, I meant to clarify what reamer you're looking for with my
previous post, but maybe it didn't come across.

You want a &quot;Size H adjustable blade reamer&quot; (I didn't know this was a
standard size until I looked it up in MSC, as in my previous post). The
range of adjustment is 15/16&quot; to 1-1/16&quot; (23.75mm to 27mm). One post to
the list referred to it as 24mm to 27mm.

Unless your hardware stores are better stocked than ours, I don't think
you'll find it there. We have a contractor type distributor called
Industrial Supply that carries some machinist's reamers, or you could
check the machinist supply houses. I got a 5/16&quot; reamer to rebush my
Solex carbs at the local Industrial Supply.

Since you've got the bushing kit, take it along and you can make sure
you're getting a reamer that will fit in the un-reamed bushings and
expand as large as the pivot shaft.

Also, call MSC Industrial Supply. Their catalog is a couple thousand
pages and apparently available on CDROM now... a great reference even if
you're just trying to find out what tools are available for a given
task. I just found their WEB page at http://mscdirect_dot_com/, or you can
call 800-645-7270. They used to send out a catalog just for the asking,
and they only wanted $20.67 for the imported version of this reamer in
the 1995 catalog. See my previous post for 1995 order numbers... they
may be the same.

No affiliation with the above, just impressed.

Let me know how it goes,
pd

&gt; size should I ask for?  24mm?  Or is this something that comes in a kit?
