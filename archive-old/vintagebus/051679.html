&gt;&gt; &gt; As for straight 30 weight I have not found a bargain brand with a &quot;SL&quot; 
&gt; rating, so I stick with Pennzoil 30 or Castrol 30 for more $.  &lt;&lt;

Hi Adrian,
Beware of Pennzoil.  In our experience it leaves a thick waxy film inside the 
engine case, and makes the oil passages smaller.  Plus it probably coats the 
inside of the cooler which could insulate the oil from properly transferring 
it's heat to the metal of the cooler.  We have found no waxy build up with 
the use of Castrol.
