I don't know Karl. John has replied trying to help, and your
response seems a little hostile. Your first post did not
include the info you gave in the second post. If you give
halfassed info, you get half useful help. 

If you feel the bearing is bad from the get-go, take it back
to where you got it.

&gt; Let me make this clear:
&gt; The outer race is very tight in the housing.
&gt; The inner race is very tight on the stub axle.
&gt; The rollers are permanently attached around the inner race.
&gt; When you put the inner race/roller assembly inside the outer race, you CAN
&gt; move it back and forth almost an eight of an inch. This is with the bearing
&gt; laying on a flat surface and you are moving the inner race back and forth.
&gt; With the brake drum on, you can rock the drum a 1/4 of an inch at the edge!
