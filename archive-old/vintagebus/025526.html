Subject: Seat bar refurbishing?
Message-ID: &lt;3765D88C.36FC6626_at_mcn_dot_org&gt;

Question for gurus and apprentices alike,

Any ideas for refurbishing the plastic covers on deluxe
middle 1/3 2/3 seat bars off a '60?  This year seat has the
bar that sticks in the holes on either side and a screw in
plate in the middle (for the 2/3 section).  I know how to
clean plastic, but that would be my last resort.  There are
too many knicks and such.  Does anyone sell new covering and
what have you for these things??  or do it yourself with
what materials?  Thanks in advance.

Gerald
