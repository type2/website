Hi Carl,
If the engine is tuned correctly, especially the valves, the knock is 
probably a connecting rod bearing going bad!  It is not going to get better, 
just worse.
   Eric helped at the gate last year at Vintage.  In line was four guys from 
Canada in a lowered type3 that was clattering at idle.  Eric asked if they 
had checked thier valves lately and hoped that was the problem when they said 
they had not for awhile.  Next day we got a call from a friend who was 
looking for a good used engine for these same type3 guys that had thrown a 
connecting rod through thier engine case.  Last we heard they had a family 
member drive down from Canada in a RV and tow the dead type3 back home.
   Since your engine is what we call a mystery motor it probably would be 
best to take the engine apart and go through it properly and install some new 
heads.  While you are in there you might as well install a CW cranshaft also.
