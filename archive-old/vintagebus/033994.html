&lt;&lt; After power-washing my underbody and leaving it sit for a few months, I 
 managed to sieze up my front right tire.  I take out the bolts and even try 
 knocking on it with a hammer, but it's not budging.
 Any suggestions?

that never happened to me, but I have had stuck wheels.  Remove tire, take 
8lb maul with 3ft handle (useful tool to keep in bus, cut wood for campfires 
etc.), hit drum with maul.  feel free to yell, it makes you stronger.    Hit 
drum on the side facing out from the center of motion.  Or you could drive 
it, that sometimes pops it free.
