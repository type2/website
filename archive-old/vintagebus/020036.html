well i got the new engine from butch on wednesday afternoon, but couldn't work
on it until thursday afternoon, got going putting everything on, and then
found that the distributor drive shaft had slipped in transit, need to bring
the engine in to get that fixed, a whole lot of driving around, borrowing a
truck from a friend getting someone to help me lift the engine etc... could
have probably finished tonight but needed to return truck to friend, and
couldn't quite make it back out to the shop tonight...too tired. going away
this weekend,so the bus is on hold until next moday or tuesday...

i'll let you all know when it starts running....
