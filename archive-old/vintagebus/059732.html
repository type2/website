Subject: Re: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes

Hate that! also sucks when its a part and you've put money/time into packing
the item only to be left without payment. Not as financialy damaging but
still annoying is the guy who calls repeatedly asking the same questions
about a part/vehicle, or things like &quot;so this other guy has a double cab for
$XXXX is that a good deal?&quot;


&gt; Don't forget the &quot;That sounds great I will take it, will send a money
order
&gt; tomorrow!&quot;  2 weeks later no money order and email from guy saying
something
&gt; like sorry couldn't afford it or something, but you were led on for a week
&gt; saying it was sent and passed up several buyers.
