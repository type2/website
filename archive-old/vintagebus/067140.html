Subject: using a cyl head temp sensor for oil temp?

have a project in mind, but not sure if it will work...
  i am installing a tight-fin T3 oil cooler in my 1600, and it has a 
hole for an oil pressure sender ; i have a 2.0 L head temp sensor 
that fits this hole (bosch 0 280 130 012). the idea is that this 
SHOULD read me the temp of the oil going TO the bearings. i am not 
sure how this sender works tho, nor what guage would work. i couldn't 
find a bosch spec page for it - i know it is used in the digifant 
system; anyone have the specs (voltage output, temp range, etc)?
