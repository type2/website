Subject: Bus Heater Cable Q

I am replacing the heater cable for my 64 Single cab. I get the new cable 
routed without a problem but the cable ends appear to be to short by a couple of 
inches. I cannot stretch the cabble to the heater box barrel clamp mounts. I 
have tried swapping the cable ends into the opposite holes but no help. This is 
the 2nd cable I have tried as I ruined the first one. The cable was purchased 
from WW for a non walk-thru bus. Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong,

Thanks
