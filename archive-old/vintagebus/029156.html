This thread has gone from fun to mean, IMHO.

A bus is more than just a machine, mass produced as cheaply as possible.
Yes, this a very versatile machine, easy to fix, fairly cheap to own,
and now becoming valuable to collectors. Why? Look at the other nine
entries on Ralph Nader's 10 Worst List... Where are they today?

A good part of the appeal (and consequently, value) of a VW bus is the
mystique that it has, and the bus owes a lot of its mystique to the
hippies. People see an old box on the road, with small, curtained
windows, and wonder, what kind of parties were held in this box? Were
children possibly conceived in there? Where has it been? Could someone
be living in there?

The box holds mysteries that intrigue everyone who sees it, especially
those who have lived an ordinary, boring life, those folks who went to
college and got married and work 9 to 5 and have 2.5 kids and a cat, who
hate their jobs and aren't in love with their lifelong mates anymore...
The people who see a bus and imagine owning one and running away from
their drab, dreary lives, living on the road, experiencing romance,
rebelling from the rest of the rat race. Same as Harley Davidsons.

Ok, the hippies are probably to blame when you get pulled over for a
faulty tail light, but you might not even know or care about buses if
the hippies hadn't given them the image that they have.

Do you hate hippies because you secretly envy them?
