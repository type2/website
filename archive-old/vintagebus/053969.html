Subject: friday finally!

saw this today and had to share.


Today's MailBits_dot_com Joke:

A few years ago the battery in my beat-up VW Beetle had died 
because I left the lights on overnight. I was in a hurry to 
get to work on time so I ran into the house to get my wife to 
give me a hand to start the car. I told her to get into our 
second car, a prehistoric oversized gas guzzler, and use it
to push my car fast enough to start it. I pointed out to her 
that because the VW had an automatic transmission, it needed 
to be pushed at least 20 mph for it to start.

She said fine, hopped into her car and drove off.

I sat there fuming wondering what she could be doing.

A minute passed by and when I saw her in the rear-view mirror 
coming at me at about 30 mph, I realized that I should have 
been a bit clearer with my directions.
