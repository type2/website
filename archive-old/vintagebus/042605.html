hi all,

I went to harborfreight and bought a hammer and dolly set and a
handsledge.  An hour of ear splitting noise later my corner is almost back
to normal, i'll do the final metalwork whenever i am ready to repaint. But
fort now it looks pretty darned good for an amateur working with
taiwaneese body hammers that seem to have been sized for midgets banging
on thin aluminum. (the handsledge was full size though, heh)

Also, i like driving my bus into bad roads, and would love to have a
limited slip or locker differential.

They are available for IRS 68+ bus trannies for a reasonable price
(lock-right diff, weddle engineering) but i have found nothing for
swingaxle busses... save for a Quaife, which is really an on-road type of
diff, and is $pendy! (about $1,600.00, ouch)

I've never persoanlly seen an M220 bus, nor a factory limited slip diff
for a swingaxle, is anything available?

Short of that, i know you can put an IRS rear end in a bus, and i know you
can put a bug tranny in there, BUT, i know also you can put a 68+ bus
tranny in a bug...

Can you put a 68+ bus tranny in a split?  That way if i ever build a bus
specifically for offroading, i could make it IRS, and put in the 68+ T2
tranny with a locker!

So, i guess my 2 questions are, what is avaialble as far as swingaxle
limited slip differentials, and will a 68+ bus tranny fit in a split
without too much massaging, as compared to an irs bug tranny, not to
keeping it stock of course.

thanks,

Steve

p.s. this is more academic than anything, i have a hard time even drilling
a hole for a screw in my 61, much less welding stuff on for IRS...
