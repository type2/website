I'm seeking some help understanding the evolution of the Split.  In

particular a crewcab.  Can anyone summarize general changes?



I'm looking at a 1959 Double Cab, and I'm curious as to how practical some

changes could be.  My goal is to make it daily driver suitable without

making it impossible to return to stock later.  Yes, I want to make sure my

changes are mostly bolt-on and can be reversed:



  1) Tranny top speed and how practical it would be to swap tranny out with

higher top speed gears (Todd Hill in Olympia).
- - - - -
depends on whether it came with a split case or a tunnel case tranny.   They
started the tunnel case tranny in May 59, at ch# 469 506.  if the case is
bolted together at the seams like a engine, seam running front to back it is a
split case.  It mounts differntly at the nose cone, a tunnel case tranny can
be bolted in with an *adaptor plate*  to a split case tranny bus, as has been
done to my early 59 truck.   As to the speed it goes at rpms, the only way to
tell is to put a tach on it and drive it.   It will be lowered geared with the
36mm reduction boxes (1.39), the 46mm boxes given a 1.26, meaning higher
speeds at same engine rpm.
. . . . . . . 

  1a) Redux boxes -- what years are interchangeable?  What would bolt on to

a '59?
- -  -- - - - 
either style r.box will bolt on to a bus tranny.  yes, you can put 46mm nuts
on a split case tranny.  Be aware, however, to keep the braking front to rear
ratio correct (which is safer) the front and rear brakes should match- so if
you have the 63 and earlier front spindles, you should have the 36mm nut rear,
to keep the braking right.  Early front axles have a dust cover w/o a lip to
pry, the 64-67 ones have a handy lip to pry the dust cover over the axle nuts
off. (look under hub cap if it is there).  Which means if you want 46mm in the
back, you should swap out the front axle as well.


  2) Anything unusual in putting a 1600DP bug engine in this?  Is it frowned

upon to have to enlarge the 6v tranny to accept a 200 flywheel?
- - -- - -  -
engines are frequently changed around.  I prefer SP engines as they are
sturdier (DP heads tend to crack).  I also prefer bus mufflers- bug tailpipes
cause people to cut the apron :( and either cut :( or leave off the rear
bumper :( and the exhaust will billow around the back of the bus, instead of
blowing away if it is vented out the side.  If it is VIN 469 505 or earlier,
it may be tricky installing/removing the motor due to heater box hangups as
those ones came w/36hp motors and the heater boxes are shorter than the later
boxes.   Tranny bell housings get ground out.   use new starter bushing.
Keep the air cleaner that is stock to the vehicle.


  3)  Brake parts and other stuff?  What years are of relevance

(compatible)?
- - - -
keep the front and rear matched.  They did one set for the barndoors, another
post barndoor 55 through 63, and then another 64-67.   the rear wheel cylinder
are the same 55-67, but the shoes and front wheel cylinder are differnt.    


  4)  Tail lights, head lights, wire harness, electrical in general.  What

years would I expect to be compatible?


- - - -
if you have the stock taillights (round glass) those are 58-61.  Hard to fiind
nice ones ($$).  Itook the junk someone has put on my 59 truck off, and put in
original style with not so clean bezels and cracked lenses.  Truck does not
deserve taillight worth more than I paid for it.   At this point at least.
Headlights are functionally widely interchangable, if you aren't worried about
correct logos.   wiring harness post barndoor 55- june 60.  (6fuse fuse block-
later ones have 8 fuses) It came with everything with screw on connectors.


Again -- If I get original stuff (like engine), I intend to store them away

and take care of them until I can do a full restoration.



Anything else I should be thinking of and/or anticipating?  The bus in

question sat in a junk yard for 20 years, and hasn't been driven for

decades.  Is a split this old difficult to find &quot;normal parts&quot; to turn  it

into a daily driver?
- - - -
definatly replace all your brake hoses.  I'd get a new Master cylinder too,
they are only about $30.   It can be hard to find some parts- but many parts
are available through your local VW flaps, and mail order.  Regular flaps
probably have tune up stuff and oil change gaskets, and that's about it.
Oh, I get my front wheel bearings at the local flaps, but those are the 64-67
kind and I bring one in to compare (anyone remember the story of Goldilocks
and the Three Bearings when I put Nellie together?)

BTW, self supporting starters are nice, but cost more.   Bushings take a long
time to wear out.    If you have the engine out, it is so easy to put in a new
bushing.
