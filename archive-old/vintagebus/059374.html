Hi Carl,
Yes, but then it cools down so much especially when idling and hardly reaches 
a minimum of 160 oil temp to keep not only the water vapor out of the oil, 
but also keep alot of raw fuel out of the oil!  Plus you get better ring 
longevity and better sealing (= more HP) when up to proper engine temp.  
Lastly your engine does not tear itself slowly apart due to constantly 
changing shape and size due to these large fluctuant engine temps.
