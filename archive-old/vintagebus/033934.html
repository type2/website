&lt;&lt; Actually, he's not the only one.  My '63 (1139075, July 3rd) has innie
 vents, small back window, fried eggs, and fridge handles.  I've only got
 bigger brakes and a big nut tranny because a PO put a '67 trans in at one
 time.  So yeah, I suppose it was a late '63 thing for a lot of us.  :)

both of my 63s have innies(well the dormobile only has em on one side, the 
whole other side is off a 60) I think all 63s had fried eggs and fridge 
handles. I used to have an early 64 with fridge handles otherwise like any 
other 64, big rear hatch etc.
