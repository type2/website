Subject: Radiusing brake shoes to drums...

Hi all,

Before you all go grating and sanding those brake shoes to fit your drums, be
aware that there are still brake shoes out there with asbestos in them.  I
read an article in the St. Louis paper a few weeks back that talked about all
the mechanics who were dying of asbestos contamination in their lungs.
Canada, the major supplier of asbestos, is still trying to roll back the laws
or ordinances restricting the use of asbestos in products, especially Brake
parts.  The reporter went into several current day shops and had the mechanics
pull brake shoes off the shelf, and they were stunned to find that quite a few
sets were labeled to contain asbestos.  All I'm saying is you better be damn
sure that you're wearing a great respirator while working around brakes and
brake dust, clean yourself up well (including your clothes) after a brake
job...

Stay healthy!
