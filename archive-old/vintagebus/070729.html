Subject: Re: [VB] Brakes revisited

Hi, John and the List...
You can play with values in this formula for a simple 
brake system to see how they effect each other:

F1       A1
__  =   __
F2       A2

whereas:
F1= Force, in pounds, applied to master cylinder
F2= Force, in pounds, being applied to wheel cylinder
A1= Area of master cylinder piston, in square inches
A2= Area of wheel cylinder piston, in square inches

F2, the force being applied to the wheel cylinder is what we
want to find out...

OK, let's plug in the following info: for  A1&gt; 22.5mm master cylinder
(or converted to .636 sq.in.).  for A2&gt; 22.5mm wheel cylinder
(also converted to .636 sq.in.)
Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1,      and F2 would be......
100 pounds!

OK, let's adjust the info: for  A1&gt; 24mm master cylinder
(or converted to .724 sq.in.).  for A2&gt; 22.5mm wheel cylinder
(converted to .636 sq.in.)
Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1,     and F2 would be......
87.85 pounds  !!??!!

Thus proving that &quot;bigger isn't always better!&quot;

DUCK

&gt; The *percieved* increased stopping power is probably due to the freshly 
&gt; adjusted brakes. The stopping power of a brake system comes from the 
&gt; pressure created in the master cylinder by your foot pushing on the 
&gt; pedal. ....
