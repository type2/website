&gt; Matt, just add another battery tray to the other side and add rack clusters
&gt; to a cutout on your overhead vent. If you pull your luggage tray that should
&gt; give you enough room for extra equipment and throwing away the radio and
&gt; installing your ILS/VOR along with the VHF/HF radio panels will compliment
&gt; your Collins rack. Now if you had an SC like mine, you could install it all
&gt; in the treasure chest with appropriate cooling system ! Also, you may want
&gt; to install ARINC 629 if you plan on installing a Connections Phased Array
&gt; antenna on your roof for future phone, internet, and cable TV options.

Considering the appearance and amenities of a splitty, shouldn't we be
installing DC-3 vintage avionics in the bus?  We'll talk on HF, home with
the ADF on our local 3-letter AM station, and keep the airway beacon
lights to the left...
