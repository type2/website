Subject: Re: [VB] SC vs DC - hoops

&gt; .......I believe they are the same except for the rear hoop has no slotted
&gt; bracket  about a foot up from the bottom to fasten it to the rear of the
&gt; cab, &amp; also has rubber bumpers on each side to buffer the side gates from
&gt; the hoop. On SC tilts, there is also an intermediate curved strap that
&gt; supports the middle of the wood slats, unlike the DC slats.

Ah, my bumpers are missing.  I have the curved strap - do you not
use it on a DC?  I don't see how it can hurt.  

Any sources for wood?
 
&gt; &gt; The question, however, is with the front hoop; is there a SC/DC
&gt; &gt; difference?  When I tried to bolt up the front hoop, there's a
&gt; &gt; 'rib' that prevents the bottom holes from lining up.
&gt; 
&gt;  Not sure what you mean by rib-is it on the hoop or the truck? Pic?

It's on the bed.  My friend's single cab has it too.

&gt; The slotted bracket should be flush +- to the front of the truck bed. Have
&gt; you got the hoop turned around?

Nope, this bolted down just fine.  Maybe these hoops are for a later bus?
