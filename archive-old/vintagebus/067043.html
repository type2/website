&gt; CB Performance sells a filter pump that is a SCHADEK  (the only brand
&gt; readily available) and it has a KEYED drive gear, not pressed on like the
&gt; Taiwan ones, it has 26 mm gears ( I never use any bigger) and is a great
&gt; unit. 10 years of using this brand without a failure.

Thanks Ronnie,
Duh!!  We forgot about the manufacture of those.  Schadek is a major 
manufature of quality stock VW oil pumps.  BTW has anyone checked out the 
AUDI/VW manufactured oil filter/pumps?  We have seen these for $50.00, but 
did not have time to ask the shop owner if we could take one apart to inspect 
it quality.  Does have the same muffler heat riser interferance.  Apparently 
manufactured for Mexican FI engines that do not have the heat risers and has 
hydralic valves which need clean oil.
  The Melling oil pump leakage is not external but between the body of the 
pump and engine case.  Resulting in air sucked from the sump area of the cam 
gear and escaping oil pressure on the other side into this same cam sump 
area.
