Subject: [VB] floor/frame replacement
Message-Id: &lt;199911051605.JAA24899_at_green-dome.village_dot_org&gt;

So all the books on body repair that I've seen have all these cautions
about making sure you fit the new piece exactly where the old one came
out.  Makes sense, and seems reasonable, except when what said new
piece is attaching to also needs to be replaced.  The latitudinal
frame members are mostly gone (not a big surprise to most, I
suspect).  However, due to large holes in the front wheel wells, the
flooring that they weld onto also needs to be replaced.  Any
suggestions on how to replace all that and still end up with
everything in the right place?

Thanks.
