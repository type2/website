&lt;&lt; So I was puttering around with that today - and I noticed that when the
 reserve knob is pushed all the way in the lever on the valve does not go all
 the way up.  So I disconnected the cable and pushed the lever all of the way
 up and it started leaking really bad.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
We have had that happen once on ours.  Just a couple of push pulls of the 
knob and the valve stopped leaking and has done so again for several months.  
We set our knob so it is about 1/8&quot; from all the way in when the valve is in 
the normal tank postion.  This allows for the slight spring effect of the 
cable housing and still fully throw the valve.  We have heard of rebuild kits 
but do not know who has them.   Eric&amp;Barb
