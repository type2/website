I think the main problem here (besides crappy mirrors) is relying on email 
for this type of complaint.  Sure I realize it's easier to bitch and moan 
about something via email rather than over the phone (just like it's easier 
to bitch over the phone than it is in person) but until you get someone on 
the phone and let them know you arent going to put up with crap like the 
mirrors they sent you, not much is going to happen.

Be more assertive, pick up the phone, talk to the man in charge!
