Subject:  RE: [VB] Rebuilt Steering Box Sources? (Prices?)
Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2000 13:59:38 +1100

Ah,

Fair enough for a 'new' box.  I think these prices refer to 'rebuilt'
and I'd be 100% sure rebuilt boxes don't have new peg
and worm (maybe they are properly adjusted).

As a point of interest I pulled down a 'rebuilt' US box
(don't know by whom - came in bus) and found that the
ball bearings weren't  the right size.  A little OS,
which meant 11 (instead of 12) were fitted with a little
'gap'.  I could feel the 'roughness' caused by this - no
hangups, no sticky bits, just a little bit 'graunchy'.

&gt; &gt; OK,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Having just rebuilt a steering box I've gotta ask
&gt; &gt; why are the rebuilts so expensive? They're worth a fortune
&gt; &gt; changeover here in Australia as well.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; When my steering box failed, it was the peg (and probably the worm) that
&gt; failed.  These are rather precise machined parts which are then
&gt; case-hardened (?) and who knows what else.  My feeling is that it is these
&gt; parts that make the new boxes pricey.
