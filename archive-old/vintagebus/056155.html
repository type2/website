Subject: Legalities of stamping an engine case

Hi All,

My 1500 motor for the tipper is almost complete starting from a 'no number'
case, rimco cw crank, rods, etc, and correct tin from Ronnie (oldvolks)...
inside it won't be as correct as maybe I'd like (it's actually a 1600 due to
shear bull headedness of Glenn who is building it... &quot;No one will be able to
tell except you on all the mountain passes around you&quot;) but from the outside
it will look as stock and og as possible... and if not, I'll change what
ever people complain about ;-)

Anyway, I'm tempted to stamp the case with the original serial number and a
few people have told me this is highly illegal(!)  Accordingly, I called
both the DMV and the state police here in Oregon and both referred me to the
other... typical bureaucracy :-)   I explained that this was a restoration
process and I wasn't doing it to hide anything, just to be retentive.  They
both responded that they didn't see anything wrong with it since they look
only at the chassis number of an older vehicle such as this.

Any thoughts, suggestions, insight, or previous experience?


Oh, I got the front king pins back together Friday evening but couldn't find
the time this weekend due to mothers day to put the front end back
together...  but I did update the web page.
