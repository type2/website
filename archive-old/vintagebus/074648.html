Subject: A sincere thank you...

To the List administration,

Now that the server move is over, apparently so painlessly too, I for one just
want to say thanks again to all of you who administer this list for our use
and enjoyment!  We shouldn't take your knowledge, devotion and hard work for
granted.  Reading and enjoying this Type 2 resource every day is a vital part
of my daily routine, and I don't know what I'd do if it didn't exist!  We
should all remember to send in a donation every once in a while to cover &quot;our&quot;
costs and keep this VintageBus list humming along.  I just wanted to say it
out loud to you folks, &quot;Thanks for your efforts on behalf of all of us&quot;!
