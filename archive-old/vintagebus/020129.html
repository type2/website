  Thanks for the radio info - I talked to the Radio 
Smack here and they have one. Since its cheaper than a 
block-off plate I will go see how it looks! They say it 
has a cassette player so it may look too modern for my 
tastes and the DC's austere personality (however I would 
get to listen to all those New Order and Joy Division 
tapes again!). If I do get one I will need a speaker 
also- what should I be looking for to fit the dash?
  Also, I have a portable CB that plugs into a cig 
lighter. I would like to take this to the 
OCTO/caravan/classic but have no cig lighter. Any 
suggestions as how to best run this?
  Yes, the DC has been converted to 12v.
Thanks!
