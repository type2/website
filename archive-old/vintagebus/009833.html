Subject: Southwind Heater Wiring
Date: Thu, 5 Oct 2000 15:43:01 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My bus has a Stewart Warner Southwind Heater that appears to be complete.
The heater hasn't worked since I've owned the bus and I'm starting to think
about
digging into it a little deeper to get it going now that it's getting cold
out.
I bought a parts and service manual from someone on e-bay not long ago, and
it's
been a big help in identifying parts and understanding the principles behind
the heater operation. My question is this, where does the heater power come
from? I have a plunger style switch under the driver's seat, but when I pull
it out and turn it nothing happens. Also there's a small red wire running
under the floor mat to the fuse block area but it's not plugged into the
fuse block anywhere.
The parts and service manual doesn't indicate how the wiring for the switch
works and of course this red wire doesn't show up in either the Bentley
wiring diagram or in the manual anyplace.
Can someone who has a working heater give me some tips?
Also, it appears there is a part missing that could be a flexible hose of
some kind that goes from the heater outlet to the ductwork that goes through
the firewall and under the westy's seat.
Can someone describe this part for me and tell me what to look for?
BTW...there's a Southwind heater repair/restore shop listed in the
classifieds of Hot VW's but I've been trying to call them off and on for a
couple of weeks with no success, does anybody have the scoop on this
company?
Thanks in advance.
