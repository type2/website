&gt; Beto and I missed the Listee group photo while we were
&gt; towing back the broken down bus of Chris and Jen from
&gt; Phoenix.

Damn - sorry to hear this.  In all the hubbub and commotion you guys got
left out.  I was in a tizzy the whole time and didn't know up from down
through the whole event.  Maybe next year we need to have a set time for the
group photo and just &quot;do it.&quot;  It sucks that you guys got the shaft by
helping out some people.  You did do the right thing though - that was nice
of you.
