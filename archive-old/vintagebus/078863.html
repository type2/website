Subject: Re: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

well, i finally got time between work shifts this am to do the gear oil
inspection. no big metal chunks! both rgb's had plenty of fine metal particles
like glitter in the pan, and the center section drain plug magnets both had
plenty of fine particles on them as well.  passenger side rgb also had several
small chips of wood in it!?  fresh stalube all around, back on all 4's, go for
a drive around the neighborhood, still making plenty of noise.  my question
has now become since there are no big chunks, can i drive &amp; enjoy it with out
fing things up?
