Subject: 2nd Annual Buses By the Beach BUS BRRR Winter Campout!  

Join the always interesting Buses by the Beach (www,busesbythebeach_dot_com)
gang at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana for our 2nd Annual Bus Brrr!
Winter Camp on Saturday and Sunday February 10-11th, 2006.
http://www.indianatraveler_dot_com/state_parks/pokagon.htm

As always, we combine our love of the venerable VW Bus with fellowship and
fundraising for our favorite charity, The Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors. http://www.phoenix-society_dot_org

Last year's inaugural event was a blast!  We rode the crazy refrigerated
dual toboggan run (45 mph-faster than a Split Window Bus!) after setting up
camp, then returned to 3 kinds of famous Buses By the Beach Chili and a
roaring campfire. LIMBO newsletter did a feature of us having a good time
and getting an early start to the Bus Season.

Dress in layers!  There will be electric hookups available for all and small
1000-watt heater will keep the interior of the bus nice and toasty.  All
campsites are located near pit toilets. Alcohol is permitted in February,
but not obnoxious drunks.

So fire up the bus and point it towards Northeastern Indiana and join us for
a great time and help out a worthy cause!

Pokagon is a State Park and bringing in firewood is prohibited due to the
Emerald Ash Borer Beetle.  There will be firewood available.  We will have
specially designed hoodie sweatshirts for sale commemorating the event.

Any questions, Pmail:
Todd at todd.olson_at_chater_dot_net
Pete at pnocean_at_earthlink_dot_net
Brien at briendews_at_charter_dot_net

Wishing you many miles of smiles in your Bus!
