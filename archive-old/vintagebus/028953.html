Subject: Shocking Development &amp; Look Out Fresno!

I finally got around to replacing the shocks all around on the DC.  From
their lack of providing any shocking resistance, one might think that
the old ones were originals.

Replace them with KYB gas (KG 5530 &amp; KG 4521) and what a difference!
The uncertainty that I felt is gone and the truck seems to have a firm
grip on the road now.  Also brought the rear end up about 1 inch.  No
more saggy rear for me.

What brought this on is that I will be driving the truck up to Fresno
week after next where I will be taking a Seiko robot training class at
FCC.  There is no way that I wanted to mix it up out there on the 5 with
all the trucks without the shocks being up to snuff.

Any listees in Fresno, if you happen to spot the DC, it's just me up for
the week.
