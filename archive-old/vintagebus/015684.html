I can go either way.  It's interesting to see the unusual items,
items which are mis-listed (some real gems out there) 
or hilarious terms &amp; prices, but not every single mundane part.
ie &quot;12v Coil used - http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/search.cgiewgrj;ewjhigig4h032h80gh80&quot;

Another thing to consider - most of the listees are already surfing
ebay for bits, so it's kinda redundant.

&gt; posts to the list than searching e-bay every day!
