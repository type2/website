&gt;btw the reserve lever knob thing is good, I know I have about 20 or 30
miles
&gt;left when I have to pull it.     And useful when pulling the motor as you
can
&gt;switch the lever to &quot;off&quot;.

Yes, agreed.... much!...... i like the idea, i was working on the miles per
pound and noting my mileage... but got it way wrong.... - i used the same
miles per pence a la 8 years ago with my 62...  - errr.... bozo!... petrols
gone up a hell of a lot sinse then! :)
ended up running out miles from a fuel pump, had to either hike it - with 4
year old :( or ring recovery &lt;g&gt;

&gt;And don't just replace the one hose.  replace them all.


yes, yes YES..... you are all right... i know.... Thanks again.... i
conscider you as probably saving my life...
was lying under the bus last night with my new (single) flex hose...
trying to undo a stuborn connector.....  then Clara's voice came to my
ears.......&quot;replace the lot you damn fool!!&quot; mm... got a kid, and the wife,
2 buses, a moke, no job :)... hmm best looking after that lot.

so before i change my mind - the wire snips came out..... snip snip snip....

got a fair few lines to replace now.... getting them today.

:)
