Subject: NEW DOOR PANEL VENDOR

Hello all,
there used to be a gentleman in the Sacramento/Roseville area that made and
sold NEW door panels for both buses and bugs.
He did a very good job and was resonable priced.
If anyone has his number or e-mail I would really appreciate it.
Thank you for your help in advance !!
regards,
Jim
