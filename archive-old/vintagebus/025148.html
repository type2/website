Subject: 6V to 12V turn signal relay problem
Message-ID: &lt;372486DB.B4FB74C8_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk&gt;

My 1960 (US) single cab was converted to 12V by the PO. Now it seems
that the
flasher relay has died and I'm not sure what to get to replace it. It
has all-red
light units at the back so the flasher unit flashes the tail lights
unlike the bulb per light
of the later ones. I assume that I need a flasher unit from a '68 bay
with all reds at
the back, because it's basically the same configuration as I have.

Anyone know what flasher unit (4 connectors) you need for a '60 12V
conversion ?

Lee.
