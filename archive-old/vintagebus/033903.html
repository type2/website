&lt;&lt; I got a phone call at work this morning from the Conway County,
 Arkansas Sherrif's Department asking if I had worked on a woman's
 '71 bus on Thursday or Friday. She was found dead in a rest area
 on I-40 near Conway. Apparently she was having some trouble with
 her bus on a cross country trip and someone she knew had given
 her my name from the AIRS list &gt;&gt;

I hate hearing about this sort of thing.  Just goes to show you that even if 
we &quot;bus folk&quot; come off to many people as out going and nice, things like this 
can still happen no matter where you are.  It is reasons such as this that I 
ALWAYS make sure to bring along an extra person when making any significant 
trip whether day or night.  I also tend to carry spare parts and tools in the 
bus which can be used to defend myself if such an attack does occur. Breaker 
bars work wonders.  

Report on my bus:  All is running good now and I will have it in Jerome!  
Next year maybe I will bring the 57. Shes kinda in pieces and all boxed up 
right now.  Hope to see everyone there!  Hopefully we can get some more 
listee photos taken!
