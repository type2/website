Volks,

OK, so I'm readying Gretchen for our trip to MT, replacing a rear brake
drum that got loose and lost snugness in the splines.  I'm replacing
drums, my 3-cords-left clutch cable, and miscellaneous screws, as well as
stripping my safaris of the remnants of paint and the subsequent surface
rust, and repainting.  

I had to pull the drum off to check the numbers on the inside of it, and
when I came back yesterday, the splines of the axle have a nice oil trail
and a cute little puddle on the ground.  The bearing cover seal was
replaced almost exactly one year, 2000 miles ago, and there was no
leaking until I pulled the drum off.  What does this say to you?  I'm not
sure if it goes away when the drum is torqued back on or if I should be
hunting around for a new seal rebuilt kit 6 days before I drive to MT. 
And if that is not normal, what's going on in there?  My current thoughts
are that I'm replacing the seal, but I have no idea why it was completely
dry until I pulled the drum off.  

Help!   PLEASE!  6 days till a 1000 miles and counting.

Adam
