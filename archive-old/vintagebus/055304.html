Subject: Rattling sound

I am having a problem with a rattling sound (marbles in a coffee can) 
which sounds like it is coming from the area just above the 
transmission. The rattle occurs in gears 2 through 4 and only happens 
with partial throttle. My bus had a front solid mount. I replaced the 
mount with a German rubber mount (big studs). After completing the 
job, the rattle appeared. If I lightly apply pressure to the gear 
shift lever the sound goes away. Why would the rattling only appear 
with rubber mounts? This one has got me stumped. Any ideas?

I also noticed that the accelerator cable rubs against the side of 
the transmission. It looks like the transmission sits right in the 
pathway for the cable. The transmission even has a groove worn into 
it by the cable sliding over it for many years. Is this a normal 
condition or do I need to make some changes?

Thanks,

Rocky
