Howdy folks-

I have a 68 Riviera hardtop with a 1600 sp motor.  I have been subbed here
for a month or so, and find the upright engine content refreshing compared
to the type2 loaf list, which I have been reading for quite some time.

I know it's a loaf and that this is the splitty list - but how would
posting questions  (about engine stuff for example) go over?  I just posted
to the loaf list about a clutch problem.  I get the feeling there's as much
or more wisdom here as there on a topic like that.

Thanks
