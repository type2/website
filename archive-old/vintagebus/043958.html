My little brother took his life at the age of 25.  17 years has passed and
it still pains me to think about it.  It was and still is the the most
difficult of all Gods tests I've been through.  Time has helped ease the
pain, and posts such as this one about Josh are double edged for me.
I remember the guilt, &quot;if only I had..&quot; and I feel the heart wrenching
pain again for just awhile and think about this young mans family and the
incredible grief they are feeling.  His friends too, for sure.
But the other side of the edge brings remembrances of the great times my
little Bro' and I had together.  I love the happy pictures in my minds eye
and wish that they would come more often.
To Josh's family and close friends, my sincerest regards.  I've been in
your shoes.
