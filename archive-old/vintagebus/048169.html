ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com Pmailed us:

&lt;&lt; In your response you spec'd a TS part# that is for an M14x1.5 kit.  In 
addtion to lengthening the bolt are you advising that the diameter be 
increased? If the anwer is yes then would it be better to skip the time sert 
and just tap the hole out(using the correct bits, drill, and taps?&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Darn!  They must have changed the part number!  We have a bag of them we 
bought about two years ago with that part number, but having diamensions of 
12x1.5x30mm these were a special order item then and later were not in stock. 
 Just this morning we sent off a Email to them to see if they had these or 
longer inserts availible.
 
 &lt;&lt;It seems clear to me that the stock bolt is too short to do the work that 
is really required but since I am going to have someone else do the work I am 
uncertain what to specify ?  &gt;&gt;
Best to stay with the same diameter bolts and thusly holes through the spring 
plates.  That way later things are just easier to replace/fix.  Kind of 
unlike the fellow who we know of who welded one of his his RGB to the swing 
plate......    Eric&amp;Barb
