&lt;&lt; does anyone know if the 64-67 front doors can be used on a 63 with or 
without 
 modification?&gt;&gt;
Only by cutting and welding in part of the later bus body or door to install 
the mathcing latching mechanism.  

&lt;&lt;or someone mentioned earlier the possibility of installing a later door 
handle on 63 doors.&gt;&gt;
Again only if you changed the outer door skin area.

&lt;&lt;I'm just trying to figure out a mystery bus, And I've seen early 64s with 
pull handles so it does not seem likely that a late 63 would have push 
buttons. what gives? &gt;&gt;
Sounds like someones mischief, or at best a proto-type bus.
