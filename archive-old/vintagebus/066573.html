Subject: Clutch Woes

OK volks,

I posted last week about needing to adjust my clutch, as it was getting hard
to shift.  Thanks for the many replies.  I never got a chance to crawl under
there, and today, I was on my way..., and the clutch started slipping.  I
nursed it home, but going up hills was particularly bad.(and I live at the
top of a hill!)

I adjusted the cable some, with no great improvement.  Am I looking at a
pressure plate replacement? - Thanks
