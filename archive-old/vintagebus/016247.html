Not necessarily.  The coil takes a lot less power than even that
booster relay you put in.  By its design, the switch is going to
develop resistance over time.  I'd measure voltage across the switch
(from the power-in [positive meter lead] to the starter-out terminal
[negative meter lead]) when you have the key in the start position.
There should be no measurable voltage there.  If there is, then the
switch is bad.

Went through several starters before I figured that one out one
time....
