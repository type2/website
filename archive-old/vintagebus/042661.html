Subject: decided against shifter lock
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0007140854320.48071-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hi all,

I decided against the shifter lock, turns out you have to cut a humongous
hole in your front mat, and i hate cutting things.

I ordered it from wolfsburg west, and called to return it and they said we
charge a 15% restocking fee on returns, but not on exchanges.  Ouch.

So, i got cargo and front door seals instead, so the thiefs can ride sans
rattles and leaks. (thats the only thing i really hate about my 61, the
front door latches arent the best design.  If i could put in newer latches
and keep the icepick handles i'd do it.)

The other bummer is that the new front door latch plates that WW used to
carry they are out of stock for an indeterminate time, and i was just
about to order a couple :(  anyone know of another source for a couple of
these things?

take care,

Steve
