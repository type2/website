Hi all,

Earlier today listee John Baker wrote the following concerning an Ohio ev=
ent he is promoting:

I &quot;snipped&quot; the main body of message... then John ends his post with...

&quot;Are you looking for a way to Boycott VWoA's actions??  Then blow off the=
ir vintage show this weekend and come to ours!

Peace, John Baker&quot;

*********************************************

Dear John, as well as other Midwest VW enthusiasts,

I'll try to be diplomatic as possible, so here goes.  =20

It seems to me that you aren't being fair at all to the Michigan Vintage =
Volkswagen Club, who is the actual entity that is holding and hosting the=
 &quot;MVVC Festival&quot;.  Have you ever even been to this event?  Lots of Type 2=
's regularly attend this May event, and in general, seem to keep coming b=
ack for more.  In your eagerness to jump all over VWoA's sh#t, while simu=
ltaneously promoting your own event during the same weekend, you're actua=
lly undermining the gracious efforts of a lot of hard working Vintage VW =
enthusiast who put on this event.  I personally don't care how you feel a=
bout the crap VWoA is pulling with their trademark crap.  But you, as wel=
l as others,  need to be clear about the fact that VWoA doesn't run or ho=
ld this quality event, as you initially alluded to in your post.  Basical=
ly, the only connection that VWoA has with the event is that they allow t=
he MVVC to use VWoA's parking lot for the Sunday event, they understandab=
ly put their current line of cars and regalia on display in a booth in th=
e parking lot, and in recent years they have opened up their private coll=
ection of Vintage VW's for the participants to view.  So before you get y=
our own, or anyone else's shorts all bunched up, please get your facts st=
raight and please stop incorrectly bad-mouthing the efforts of some rathe=
r nice VW enthusiast who for quite a long time now have run a great event=
.  It's okay to focus your unhappiness at VWoA.  I'm just taking issue wi=
th your mis-information and your self promotion of your event at the expe=
nse of other good VW enthusiasts.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a MVVC member, but I've attended many of thei=
r May events.  And I'm definitely not a VWoA cheerleader, and I'm not hap=
py either about how they are handling themselves while trying to protect =
their trademarks.  But I believe in being fair, and in your post, you wer=
en't.  I wish you guys luck with your event, and I hope to be able to att=
end someday, meet you all personally, and chew the fat around the fire.  =
But if you guys continue to hold it on the same weekend as such a nice ev=
ent as the MVVC Festival, many of us will be choosing the &quot;MVVC Festival&quot;=
.  =20

Best of luck for your event!

Bill Bowman
NEATO &amp; LiMBO, VVWCA and the DKF!
