Those of you who are members of the British Split screen van club (I know 
there are some...) can look forward to a bumper edition of the Magazine 
this issue. Featuring a superb report on Camberg and an article on my bus!
Other noteables are a mention of Glen Swanson, and a colour pic containing 
his beautiful 61 grgreen bus.
There's also mention of someone called Clara, seen crawling under 
busses......

Damon.
