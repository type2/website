 I ran one on my '56, and on my '60 until recently.  The 
 bus didn't run any cooler, but I liked spreading the 'wear'
 over more oil.  I don't think the amount of time it takes
 to heat the extra oil is significant.  If it was, then why not
 reduce the case sump capacity to 1qt?
  &gt;&gt;
I thought the idea behind the deep sump was for dune buggies etc that go at 
crazy angles.  with a regular oil pick up this can lead to the pump drawing 
air instead of oil at sharp angles (or shapr cornering), but I don't think 
that is an issue with the splitty at least 99.9% of the time.  

if you do tip your bus on its side, it is a good idea to shut the engine off 
ASAP as it will be oil starved.
