Subject: 1967 Poss for sale......  :`(

I know I should not ask this question due to my love of this ol' bucket
o' bolts.. but due to lack of time and diminishing work space, I feel it
would be in my busses best interest to let her go to a good home.

This is a California bus with no rust. The only rust I have been able to
find is at the floor board on the passenger side door post (front)

The bus was a good driver until I parked it a few months ago. Still
fires right up. You can drive it if you would like, though the
windshields are out (back to the safari discussion again) and you may
get some bugs in your face!  The chassis is complete. The interior has
been removed for paint prep, as well as the windows.  I have most
everything to put it together.

If you are interested in this bus, let me know. I will be taking it to
Pomona in March if no one here wants it.  Hey, I even though of putting
it on ebay so I could retire.!  What, $25K with parts......

Seriously, I need to make a decision on this asap.  I will be preparing
pictures of it in its current state in my garage if it will ever stop
******* raining!  In the mean time, I do have a photo of it before I
took it apart and started the body work.

I am thinking $2500 for everything.  This is a fair price for all that
you are getting. The engine is a strong 1600 dual port. I have both
front seats, a rear seat and a center (out of a bay?) as well as the
door panels (not oem) I also have all the side window glass, window
frames, and accessories, but no windshield glass.

This is a good bus. If I only had some time and a place to finish
it..... Life has its ups and downs you know. Anyone interested please
feel free to email me at seanmcelvy_at_earthlink_dot_net

Thanks Busser's

Sean
