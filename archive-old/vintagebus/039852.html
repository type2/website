wow, not bus realted, but that fastback with porsche alloys is sweeeeet! i 
dont get to see much of the cali stuff here in cleveland. BUS STUFF: what is 
that green split in the background? guessing by the color, could it be some 
special millitary model? or just some hack job. cool though. neat if it had 
a turret on top ;)
later,
