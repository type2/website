&gt;I like splitties better, but i have 2 bays 2 vgons and 3 splits, I can
&gt;easily enough change what I drive and sell something... My big dilemma now
&gt;is do I put the Golf/jetta engine in my 66 deluxe POS or my 70 deluxe POS.
&gt;
&gt;peas,
&gt;

&gt;

I think the 70 would be easier to do. More room. Look at those crazy baja 
bus boys (a search of baja bus will reveal the site) they cram v8's in thier 
without them sticking way out back.
I too am thinking diesel, hopefully a tdi vw in the bus someday. Dave in 
Oregon who was giving away the camper parts told me he had a buddy making 
diesel fuel from old vegetable oil. Someone in Oly is doing the same thing, 
so a high torque, effiecient, and cheaply fueled engine seems the way to go!
