Subject: Fall Tour Ontario Canada 

October 12 13 2003 to be confirmed --I have a Favorite Drive I like to take in
the Fall,, it has so many scenic spots! I think that this drive really should
take about 4 beautiful fall days to complete! 
BUT we will try to see the majority in 2 days
Those that have more time on their hands can revisit some area's on the way
home,, or carry on further ....
Those with less time can break away anytime as we really never get much over 2
hrs away from the start point.

Southern Ontario Canada area,,, hwy 401 and 25 area heading north on the
Backbone Of Ontario, the Niagara Escarpment.

I would like to gain an idea of the interest in this tour,,,, not to see if will
happen,, but to make sure there is enough room built in for everyone!  
One question,, I want to reserve camping at the start point,, so I want to get
an idea who would be interested in arriving friday night ?

I will be confirming the times, dates and route very shortly, barring unforeseen
issues,, October 12 2002, we will Start near 401 and hwy 25 Milton Ontario area.
This is a rain or shine weekend,, with a camp over option

Please pass it around
