UPS is very specific in their size restrictions.  How they took that 
propeller is beyond me.  Their max sizes are:

Up to 150 pounds *or* Up to 130 inches in length and girth combined *or* Up 
to 108 inches in length.

Their specs are here:

&gt;  Hmm a while back I was shipping my dads  huge wooden Biplane propeller back
&gt;east... it was almost 8 feet and 100 pounds at least. UPS had no problem and
&gt;it was in a big long wooden crate(even longer). I shipped it right from the
&gt;UPS center in Phoenix. Why would gates be any different? Whats the official
&gt;size restriction?
&gt;Also shipped a 6 foot bumper via the US postal system. Im guessin thats
&gt;about the length of DC gates. Try them if UPS refuses.

&gt; &gt;I doubt they will fit with UPS's size restrictions.  I recently shipped a
&gt;set of single cab gates from CA to Oregon, and they were too big for
&gt;UPS.
