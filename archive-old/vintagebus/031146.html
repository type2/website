Subject: Cargo Door rubber

I was stripping the cargo doors I picked up  at OCTO and while removing
the old factory rubber, I noticed that the original stuff has nice cut
away portions with chamfered edges where the door hinges go.  This lets
the rubber sit down in the channel without creating a bulge where the
hinge is.  This lets the rubber lay at a uniform level to seal correctly
with the body.

The question I have is,  does the reproduction rubber have these cut
away sections or do you have to make them yourself?   Or, do you just
use it the way it comes and smash it down in there.

One more tidbit  I noticed.  These doors (and rubber) witch are low
hinge doors, still have the indent (hinge mounting point?) for the high
hinge doors.  I guess they just made the new hinge mounting point
(lower) on the die and left the old one (high) and kept stamping doors
and rubber.  Or, were they making high hinge doors for other markets at
the same time??
