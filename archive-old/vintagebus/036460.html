&lt;&lt; Hey Jason! Yeah my 57 deluxe had an original handle. They come with the
 chrome ends. And as far as I know I thought allbusses had chrome ended
 handles, could be wrong though. They are out there. Check OCTO they are
 not hard to find. I think we even have a few.

Hey Cory, 57's didnt come with dash handles. Had to be dealer or owner 
installed, so it aint hard evidence.
