To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

This is NOT a Westfalia piece...Westfalia did make a
trailer hitch but is far different from this one and
also is marked with a small brass tag like westy racks
were.

Ross Harmon with the 2 green SO-42 westys in the LA
area has one of these on his bus.  The westy ones are
very nicely made!  Not hunks of angle iron welded
together in joes' back yard like the one on eBay.

You gotta love some eBayers...could it fit on a
camper, yes?!...Well cool its westfalia then!  HA HA
HA!!

&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm betting this is another anonymously made
&gt; piece, like the VW-sold roof 
&gt; racks with ZVW part #'s &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Thom,
&gt; It is an USA made VOA piece.   Eric&amp;Barb
