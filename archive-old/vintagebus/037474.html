Hi, 
Is the cam lobe area of the distributor rust free and very lightly greased?
Once met a fella who had installed a used distributor which had a layer of
rust where the points rubbing block ran.  The rust acted like sandpaper and
wore down the block closing the points gap until the VW would not run till he
reset the points again, just to start the sequence all over again.  Eric &amp;
