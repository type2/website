I have always had great luck with Peloquin's Transaxles, in Hawthorne, Cal
(near LA).  He has all of my trans work for the last 10 years with not a
failure to date, and I drive some of them hard.

He was trained by VW and builds drag car trannies to daily drivers.  He is
only a 2 man shop, but has never made me wait more than 2 weeks for a tranny,
even in peak season.

His name is Gary Peloquin  (310) 219-1391.

&gt; O.K., everyone a year or so ago vented on Carter's gearbox shop (since
&gt; he moved to Big Bear) about the lousy quality.  Now Todd Hill is not the
&gt; best place to send almost a G of hard earned money.  So who is still
&gt; doing quality tranny rebuilds?  What about the shop down in Huntington
&gt; Bch.  CA??    I can do a lot of things to my bus (cutting, welding,
&gt; painting, motor building, wiring, etc.) but rebuilding a transmission is
&gt; not one of them.  Any positive comments of places to send a big nut??
