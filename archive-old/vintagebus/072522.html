Subject: type2s are under-valued (friday)

since it's friday...

i want to suggest that the type2 is under-rated and under-valued.  we've all heard about those $30k (give or take a couple 10k) buses and shook our heads, groaned or laughed about them.  however should it sell, what will this really swank $120k ghia do to the vw market i ask you?
