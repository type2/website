 I collect WW2 VW stuff and since you asked for a picture...not sure which
one you meant so i dug out a couple and scanned them up. The badge at the
bottom (which i think is the one you mean) also is reproduced with some red
paint in the lettering. Although the one at the bottom has a normal safety
pin style on the back, so as jerry mentioned, there were many different
repop versions of those made, not just push on clips. Also besides the
weight, you can tell if its made from tin because it is stamped, not cast.
Identical image on the back of it. I've also seen them repoped using
plastic. Goin to Jerome? a guy that is at all the AZ VW shows sells the 2
small pins repo

&gt; I've been looking for some WWII trinkets, and someone
 told me that there's a pin that has a little cog with
 a kdf-wagen in front of the cog.  Does anyone have one
 of these?  Does anyone have a picture or point me in
 the right direction?  Just wondering what they look
 like and how much they are going for.  &lt;
