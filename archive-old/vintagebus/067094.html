Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning seats etc 

Go get yourself a bottle of Meguair's Cleaner Wax.   It has worked great for 
me on the lightly oxidized paint and I also use it periodically on my camper 
window frames.  It's got a fine abrasive the will polish up lightly oxidized 
paint and will protect with the wax.

BTW you can find the stuff at any FLAPS.

Hope that helps,

&gt; Ya, my sweetie used up my tin of polishing stuff  to polish a canoe (dammit) 
&gt; 
&gt; and tossed the can, so I am not sure what is the best stuff to get.  Any 
&gt; suggestions?  Ya I want the fine stuff for polishing original paint and 
&gt; aluminium trim and that kind of thing.
