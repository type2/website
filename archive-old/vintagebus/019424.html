&gt; &gt;Looking for 
&gt; &gt;Cap for water tank.

Has anybody ever found just the cap for sale?  I've only seen one once at a 
swap, and it was attached to a complete interior that the guy would not 
separate.  I figure these are hard to come by, so I've tried to think of what
I could use instead.  One is to just shove a cork down it.  The other is a
little fancier and might even look nice -- you know those corks w/handles like
for fancy wine bottles?  I don't know the name.  But I figured that would work
and would even look like something you'd put on there.  Kinda.

&gt; &gt;Set of curtains, original brown plaid
&gt; 
&gt; Me too!!

Keep dreamin' guys ;-)
