&gt; Does someone have a baywindow &quot;workshop manual&quot; that has uncompressed

Hi Joel,
We went through our manuals that we have out of storage and could not find 
the uncompressed length.  So pulled the one we have in our 1641SP DR CW 
engine.  2.4&quot; (61mm) for the relief spring and 1.18&quot; (30mm)

&gt; Anyway, I guess what I need to do is figure out some way of compressing the
&gt; spring to a known length and measuring the force it takes to do so. I don't 
&gt; think a bathroom scales is going to do the job, maybe the type of scales 
&gt; you use to weigh the fish you just caught, pulling down on the spring 
&gt; through the middle.

A bathroom scale should work.  Those aftermarket springs are a heck of a lot 
harder, making it a pain to install.  With the stock springs we do have now 
Eric can compress each one with just a thumb and forefinger without 
straining.
