Hi ronnie,
Do not use a helicoil in places you take apart regularly!  They all too 
easily spin inward when the bolt object is threaded in.  Which in a blind 
hole is OK, but in a head is not!  Also these helicoils have a habit of 
coming out with the bolt object!  Best to invest in solid inserts that are 
locked in place.  Check out Time-Sert for these.  We use these for stripped 
spark plug holes and all of the tranny RBG to swing plate bolt holes we deal 
with.    Eric&amp;Barb
