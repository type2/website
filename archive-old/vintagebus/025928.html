Subject: Tranny leaks!
Message-ID: &lt;38064CF7.14BA8129_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I posted about the leaking boxes a few days ago, and now it seems the
transmission is leaking.  Note that this thing hasn't even been pushed
down the driveway yet (still on stands), and its leaking like the
Titanic.  I filled it up with 85/90 weight oil...is this correct?  The
new leaks seem to be coming from the side covers.  Are there seals in
there that I should replace?  I'm trying to get away with a little tear
down as possible...how hard is it to pull these covers and replace any
gaskets??  Do I have to unbolt the boxes from the spring plates to do
this??

Thanks.

Steve
