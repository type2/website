Subject: RE: Wing Window Rubber Problem!

    Hello Everyone

    Well I am close to getting my bus on the road and I just got my
front door frames painted. So I took the wing window frames down to a
local glass shop and handed them the frames and West Coast Metric Rubber
and asked them to press them together. They said no problem :-)  Well I
went to pick them up today and they scratched half the paint off both
the frames and told me that the rubber didn't work and they would like
to keep the frames overnight to fill the frames with black silicone..
(WHAT I say to myself)  Now I have window rubber that is all cut up and
not usable the frames need repainting and this glass shop wants to fill
them with silicone.( Yeah like that is going to happen)

     One I won't go back there again I have learned my lesson, Two I
have to buy more rubber and repaint the frames and Three I need to put
the frames together so that I can drive my bus again.

    So how is the easiest way to put these frames together?


Sorry for the rant I am a bit pissed right now,
