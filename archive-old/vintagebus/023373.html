 &lt;&lt;hi all,
 
 I have been seriously considering outfitting my 61 with safaris...
 
 But i do have a question...
 
 I have heard talk of an indentation in the upper window channel for safari
 mounting plates... i dont see such a thing on my bus (but not knowing what
 it looks like im a bit stumped anyway...)
 
 Post 63 (I think) busses have an indentation to allow for more clearance of 
 the dash. Pre-62 safari busses always had problems with the dash tabs 
 clearing the latches. Frames 55-67 were always the same shape/dimensions but 
 there were two different manufacturers for them.
 
 Are earlier and later safaris different for this reason, and which type of
 setup are aftermarket safaris tooled for... will i need to modify
 something to get it all to fit right?
 ....................................
aftermarket I don't know if you can say they are exactly modeled after one 
kind or another.

My 61 hardtop deluxe came with  original safaris.  They fit fine.  Yes the 
bus does have the indentation at the top of the windsheild area, just 
enoughfor the safari frame to make it ven with the windsheild rim when 
installed.   Has the threaded plate installed.   First time I noticed the 
indentation was on a 63, (ruby red double door panel aka meat wagon with 
Hausmann's Meats logos on it- now driven by Peter in Seattle)Think that was 
the first year for the indentation for non original safari buses.  so I could 
see how retrofitting safaris into earlier buses could be a hassle.

BTW, my 65 westycame with original safaris, which I removed and now reside in 
a 67 deluxe in Bakersfield.    But both windsheilds are well cracked due to 
road debris and my recent journeys.   So anyway, I will be at kelly Park 
Sunday and if I find a nice replacement windsheild, I could swap it out and 
folks could look at the indent w/ plate or take a epic to post to those 
interested.
