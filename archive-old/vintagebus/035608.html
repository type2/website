&lt;&lt;  Personally, and I think most others would agree that almost 20 thousand is
 EXPENSIVE for an un-restored bus.  What bus are you specifically talking
 about selling for 45K??  As far as I know the green slider sat  untouched
 for 40K as did Lenny's 54 at 50K.   Where are all the buyers for these?
 
 It is true that as the awareness of the marquee has risen, people with
 unlimited bank accounts will spend silly money for things/busses.  That
 said, CHEEP and EXPENSIVE are relative things.
 
 If that bus was CHEEP what is Elliss' BD....SUPER CHEEP????
  &gt;&gt;
I believe that an original nice unrestored bus is worth more than one 
restored to that shape. A well kept, low mile, 23 window is uncommon.   I 
believe is it 'unrestored' as in 'doesn't need it' rather than 'project' .

then again, after reading another post, seems that yup a few things have been 
replaced/restored on it

The thing with Ellis' barndoor, is that although it is rare, it is not 
original - has been changed from a ambulance into a camper, and so doesn't 
appeal to that crowd, although is is a very nice bus if you look at what it 
is rather than what it is not.

In any case, I don't feel like dropping 20K into a bus today.
