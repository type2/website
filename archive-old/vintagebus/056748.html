Thanks ED. I agree with you, but I guess I must &quot;clara&quot;fy my statement.

       I am sorry guys or gals..  I didn't totally clarify my statement, 
&quot;stock resto's are easy&quot;.  

They are easy from MY standpoint, the rust repair and paint and body guy.  
Almost every customer that cares about the bolts used, or glass etc, does his 
own research, finds his own bolts and gaskets him or herself.  I was 
referring to the hard one's as the one's we section, chop, suicide, channel 
etc.  Those take way more time and effort for me to complete.  In a stock 
body restoration, all I have to do is make it stock, it's a no brainer for 
the paint and body guy, even the rust repair is easy, no custom stuff, just 
basic metal replacement.  The customs cost the customer way more money to 
complete than the stock one's.  It's still hard work, just not as much time 
goes into trying to figure stuff out.
Did that help?
