Nope, it's me who's the idiot.  Didn't get my facts straight b-4 I
posted.  I posted a little &quot;oops&quot; message afterward, but anyway this
year the info is supposed to be at www.bulliboys_dot_com, according to
the flyer.  However, I checked that too and it doesnt really say
anything, so:
The Sunday show (Aug. 20) is 9:00 am to 3:00 pm, it's in Coquitlam at
Town Center Park on Pinetree Way.  This is the show they have every
year, it's usually quite large, with air and water cooled cars and a
swap meet.  It's a pretty casual, people's choice type of show.
This year they're also going to have drag racing out in Mission on
Saturday, followed by a cruise to California Import Parts for &quot;Food,
Drinks, Big Sale &amp; World's Best Burn Out Contest&quot;
I dunno about that part, their parking lot is REALLY small.  I'm just
going to the show on Sunday.

&gt;  I'm just wondering if anybody is going to the show in Coquitlam
&gt;  this Sunday?  I'll be there, as always, and this time I might
&gt;  even pull my bus into the show area!  Should be fun
&gt;  Diana
&gt;
&gt;  ps check out the events page at www.vwcalimports_dot_com if you want
&gt;  the info on the show
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; couldn't find the events page- am I just being an idiot?
