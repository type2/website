I've only seen the kits; maybe you could email/call and ask.

Failing that, buy the kit then ebay-off the pieces you don't want.

&gt; anyone know where I can get just the front two sliders for my sunroof?
&gt; All of them are good except the ones on the front main bow.  I know
&gt; Wolfsburg West sells the kit, but I was hoping to only have to buy what
