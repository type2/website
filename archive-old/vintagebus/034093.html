Subject: [VB] What is it? Mystery Camper Light



I was cleanign some stuff in the garage this weekend, and came
across this interior light which had been in the beater panel.
Upon further inspection, it ws discovered that it is actually
a two-piece unit, with a separate light and base!  The light 
itself contans a reel, which winds the electrical lead,
so you can rmeove the light from the base, and move it around
the bus!  It had a good 12' or so of wire.

Anyone ever seen one fo thse before?  It didn't have any
markings whatsoever, but it does have a glass lense.
