reshimming is okay.  A slightly off end play is no reason to do a total 
rebuild, good God!   How to figure the total allowable endplay?   Figure the 
thickness of the thickest shim made, times three, add to the maz endplay you 
should have.  Voila .

you can feel a worn motor have more endplay w/o flywheel that a good motor 
w/o flywheel
