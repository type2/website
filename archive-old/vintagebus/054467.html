Subject: Re: [VB] front end question-related to my steering problem

Are you sure this is not your shift linkage shaft rod?  It runs over the stering parts and from the bottom may look like it connects there...

i was looking under my '67 bus today to see if i could see what was causing 
my steering problem when i saw something abnormal. there is a rod that runs 
over top of the tie rod ends from the steering box-all the way to the 
engine-what is this tube called? i am slowly getting more familiar with bus 
anatomy but could use some help. any way that tube is loose and resting on 
the bolts of the swing arm/tie rods- and not letting me steer normally-
is this a major problem? would it alone cause my steering to be very loose 
and creaks and pops when i steer? any professional diagnosis out there? 
thanks for you help.
