List:

Thanks to my wife's home-based business, we always seem to get a nice
refund on income tax.  This year was even better, so I have a few bucks
to buy a working pickup.  I'm not looking for anything cherry, I already
have one of those in the '59 Westy.  Here's my preference:

pre '62 with original tailight openings
original paint, as faded and crappy as 40 year old paint can be is
perfect
surface rust is fine, no heavy cancer
minimal body damage, but a few dings and dents don't bother me
bowing in the gates is fine, waves in the bed are fine, but straight in
both categories is fine too

If anyone has or knows of a promising pickup, please let me know.

TIA.

Robert
