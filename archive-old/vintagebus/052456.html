Subject: '67 Bus Rims Out of Round

Greetings Honorable bus list members:

Well, My '67 21DLX has three rims that are “out of round” to the point that
it affects the ride, even when balanced. Wow, I thought I had every thing
relatively “licked,” on my bus and this pops up. I never saw this one
coming! More parts to locate!

What is the scoop on stock 67 bus rims? Anyone  repoing them? Any
suggestions?? The problem with buying “used” at a swap meet is that they
could be out of round too.
