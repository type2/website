&lt;&lt; I wonder how people figured out that it was Eddie in the first place?  I'd
 think that if he just dressed like a typical bus guy (however that is)
 he'd blend in just fine.  OTOH, if he had on his metal-rocker outfit and
 was trailed by an entourage he'd stick out like a sore thumb!

Personally I think it was  Katie that spotted Eddie first.  We were sitting 
at Kyle's bus and she spotted Eddie through the last side window AND the rear 
window of Lenny's super deluxe that was there.  Sure enough it was him.  We'd 
like to think she was the first to say &quot;dear god, that's Eddir Van Halen&quot;

As far as &quot;how'd anyone figure out it was him&quot; goes, come on George!  I dont 
know how old you are, but from reading your posts about your dad comming out 
to save you and your dying battery you cant be that old and I'm guessing you 
arent a Van Halen Fan of any sort, but , but....but....it was Eddie freaking 
Van Halen.  Whether some peope realize it or not, he's one of those people 
that cant just walk down the street without attracting a crowd   At least in 
my generation he is.

I bet if it came down to it, you'd recognize him too.......he wasnt hard to 
spot...=)

 I have a feeling that he'd get his desired bus a lot easier (and cheaper!) 
 if he attended in stealth mode!
