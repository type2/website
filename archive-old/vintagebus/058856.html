Subject: RE: [VB] Oxyclean on Westy tents and Pickup canvas

I used oxy clean on my carpet at home and now I have a light spot where I
cleaned. Be careful on the tent, I found that out the hard way when I
scrubed off the protective coating on one of my Sundial tent panels. For
Tents ask Van Bondo.

Subject: [VB] Oxyclean on Westy tents and Pickup canvas


Has anyone ever tried OXYCLEAN to clean a Westy tent or Pickup canvas?
You know that stuff &quot;As seen on teevee&quot;.
I'm getting ready to give it a try and wondering if anyone had a bad
experience.
