Subject: bus art

Hi everybody,
Once I stumbled upon a very nice cutaway image of a splitty bus, kind
of a section drawing right down the middle. I think it might have been
an official VW graphic, it was done in a very similar style to the
engine illustrations in the workshop manual. I can't remember where I
saw it, can anyone remind me or point out where I might find it?
Thanks,
Joel
