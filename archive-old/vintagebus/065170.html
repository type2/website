Subject: Re: [VB] grease fittings

just tap a hole in the side, and thread the zerk into it?
-----------------------
Hopefully you won't be drilling any holes in ball joints, tie rod ends.
These parts should be forged and even if you get the holes drilled with a
carbide bit its not likely that you'll ever get them tapped for a
threaded xerk fitting. There are press in xerk fittings though.
