Of course, there is always the option of using it as a  hearse...  What do 
funeral homes pay for hearses anyway.  Must be something.  Wirth checking out.

Once I read a book in which there was an advertisement for Furnival's Fun 
Funerals, which was a misprint and supposed to be &quot;fine funerals&quot;  and this 
guy had found an antique horse drawn hearse, and proceeded to restore it, get 
4 black horses, do them up with black plumes on their heads and all, appealed 
to certain crowds offcourse.  Now as the baby boomers are getting older.... 
perhaps a similar thing would be appropriate with a VW hearse,  and 
potentially profitable too! 

:)  macabe? But I am sure some people would prefer to be carried to their 
final resting palce in a VW hearse.

 What kind $ are we talking?  Rusted '65 kombi money?  Unrestored
 23-window money?  Barrett-Jackson deluxe auction money?
 
 I think you're facing the same problem that any special-body bus seller
 faces: it's a cool bus, hands down, but what would someone *do* with it
 if they bought it?  It's a little impractical for a grocery-getter,  
 Home Depot errand-mobile.  Sell it to that Malamute guy, he can add it
 to the rest of the museum he's bought.
