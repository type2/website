Hey man, you do what YOU want with the bus.  It's not like you're cutting it
up making a 'SHORTY' barndoor or something.  If it's original, or even looks
like it's original, do it.

Just my opinion

&gt; I recently bought a jan 55 barndoor panel, vin #20-114468. Been sittin
since
&gt; the 60's and the PO put newspapers soaked in oil covering the cargo area
&gt; which kept it in near perfect condition. Will be bringing it down in a few
&gt; months when my new house is finished (place to put it). I also picked up a
&gt; barndoor &quot;behr&quot; roof scoop for it (complete assembly).The &quot;problem&quot; is, I
&gt; have my sights set to install the scoop, but I started gettin nailed by
&gt; barndoor and vintage bus owners, saying I needed to be sent to a mental
&gt; institution for cutting the &quot;trademark&quot; barndoor peak.This barn has 60k
&gt; original miles, but needs a dogleg, a rocker and a few other pieces
&gt; replaced, so its not like it will be 100% uncut. So there is a
dillema...cut
&gt; the roof for a rare original barndoor only accesory? or leave it
&quot;original&quot;?
&gt; I refuse to even drill holes on an uncut VW, but since I will be replacing
&gt; metal anyway, whats the difference? I can save the piece and weld it back
in
&gt; later if i so desire...One unnamed person commented I should take pictures
&gt; of the bd peak sacrifice as it will be &quot;neat to look at me cutting up a
60k
&gt; og bd panel in a few years down the road&quot;....( I think you catch his drift
&gt; =)...
&gt; Looking for vintage nazi list opinions?
