Now, I know I'm asking for a lot of info, but I thought since it IS 
Friday it's worth a try.

We are trying to plan our trip to Tennessee and I'm looking for advice 
from those of you with road trip experience/local knowledge.  So far we 
know that we need to go straight to Albuquerque from here, so that 
part's taken care of.  We'll be leaving Albuquerque on April 24th or 
25th, headed for Knoxville TN.  After Tennessee, I'll probably head 
across to the east coast, just to see it, then up into Canada as quickly 
as is reasonable, although I do want to avoid the super-populated east 
coast areas. I thought I'd cross back into Canada somewhere in the 
middle, as exchange rates in the US make it rather undesirable to stay 
down for too long.

We will be travelling in a '74 schoolbus on the way down, and will be 
trying to find out-of-the-way (read: free and undisturbed) places to 
camp out overnight if at all possible.  Also, we'd like to find some 
cool places to visit.  So far all we know for sure that we want to see 
is the Grand Canyon.  Pretty obvious choice.

I would love any info on scenic areas and off-highway driving routes to 
try out.  From what I've heard on the list, highways sound a lot scarier 
down there than they are in Canada. Both the schoolbus and my '66 will 
be super slow, so we might need to stay on backroads. 

Please pmail, TIA,
Diana
