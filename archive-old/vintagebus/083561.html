Hello Jason  I haven't been using the paper gaskets that come with the carb 
kits  they seem cheesy and dont hold up well  I prefer the FI intake plate for 
the aftermarket carb kits  just be careful not to tighten too tight as the 
will crack  later and have fun  Mark Dearing   PS  you up for some boccee at 
dixiebus
