Subject: Drivers (door) Wanted (and some cargo floor material)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Ready to start body work and paint on my 66. If anyone has a decent driver's 
side door, I'd like to buy it. I don't need the window frame, just the door. 
I also need some a few pieces of cargo floor if anyone has any salvaged 
scraps after replacing their old floor, please let me know.
