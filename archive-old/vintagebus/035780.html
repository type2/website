&lt;&lt; OK 2 questions...
 First,  I keep reading that dd buses are rare (or atleast uncommon) but it 
seems like there are a ton of them around. Ronnie says there are 5 in Havasu, 
I know of 3 (including mine) in Houston, Thom even has one...
 Is it just that I notice the DD's more than the others? Are they uncommon? 
How uncommon are they?
 Second,  On the passenger inside latch of the first cargo door there is no 
handle, only a screw, no square thing to mount a handle to.... the drivers 
side cargos have handles on both. Should there be handles on all the doors? I 
know the pass side latch has a different # than the drivers side (well, diff 
letter 'A' vs 'C' I think)
  &gt;&gt;
ya DD panels are unusual,  or whatever.  there are more panels than DDs.  any 
rough numbers?  
yes panels came with a short outside cargo door handle.  the square rod does 
not go through so you dont put an inside door handle on.  As there is no on 
riding in the back of a delivery van, it would just get in the way.  If you 
want 2 inside handles (per side) just get a non panel outside handle, it'll 
work.  
Early (fifties) panels came with those rare grey inside cargo door handles
