 Hello Everyone

   I have a front end that appears to have come out of a late 60's early
70's bus. It is complete and under a tarp in my back yard at the moment.
When I got it I thought I would install it on my bus but I don't have time
to mess with it. Would anyone be interested in it.  I will take offers,
trades, etc....        The front end is on the Central Coast ( Cali ) if
anyone is interested.
