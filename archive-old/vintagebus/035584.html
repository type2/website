&lt;&lt; HOW DO I NOW WHAT SIZE THE FLYWHEEL ON MY 66 MICROBUS IS? &gt;&gt;
Hi,
You know what happens when you assume!  So the only way to tell is to remove 
engine.  Remove clutch pressure plate and measure both the clutch disc, and 
flywheel tooth count, or diameter.  Then since you are already in there you 
can clean things up, plus check parts for wear, and tear.   Eric&amp;Barb
