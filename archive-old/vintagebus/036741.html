&lt;&lt; Well, you have a vested interest in the escalating value of Binz crew

  This is just my personal opinion, of course.  I hope they do go &quot;through the
 roof&quot; for your sake.  It just makes the whole hobby more expensive when 
things
 sky rocket. &gt;&gt;

Yeah, you are right.  Reread my original post and it does sound a lot like a 
propaganda pamphlet.  Didn't mean to intimate the value should be exactly 
equal to the Heb just that they are under valued right now.  BTW, I have NO 
intentions of selling mine.

To me value is a double edged sword.  While it would be kind of cool to own a 
big $$ vehicle it would also suck.  How many daily Driver Hebs are there out 
there?  None.  Too valuable of a vehicle to drive on a daily basis.  Also, 
I'm not a guy with deep pockets.  If the value went up to $50K or better I 
would have to think about my priorities - college for 3 kids, paying the 
mortgage, retirement, etc - and would probably end up in a standard issue 
crew cab again.  So while it would be cool to see the value sky rocket, there 
is a big part of me that would like to see it stay reasonable so I can 
justify driving it and keeping it for a long, long, time.
