Subject: Value of rear slash/Euro bumper.
Message-ID: &lt;7js9io$m9je_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I have a really nice european (no holes, no welded up holes) slash rear bumper. It is in rattle can primer but very very straight. Does anyone know about what the value of this would be?

Thanks in advance,
