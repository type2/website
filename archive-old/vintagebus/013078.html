 Most people have become somewhat enviro-aware . .
Probably started about the time you noticed you could
see the air . .  :-)

I want to dispel some more voodoo though . .

Detergents and Phosphates . . .

When a detergent does it's thing on grease and oil,
it breaks the oil down into its basic fatty acids etc. . . 

This is no longer oil . . . this is also all the treatment
plant does before it blows it into the ocean . .

This is OK . . . those basic fatty acids and carbon compounds
are biodegradable now . . 

So unless you're pouring something with an  oil slick on it 
down the drain . . you are not harming anything . .

Phosphates . . those of us who have ever been in the &quot;Bandini&quot;
department know you have to pay for a bag of phosphate . . 
Makes flowers bloom ?  

It is a fertilizer  . .   that's the problem . . it gets in the
water system if you have it in your detergent and pour down drain.

In water system it makes the plant life grow . . algae runs amok .
Eats all the oxygen in the water . .  chokes the fish . . :-)

So you  have  this sludge from the bottom of your boiler from 
cleaning greasy parts in TSP . . tri-sodium phosphate . .

Take it out and mix it with the soil in the garden 
around the flowers . . . .  just saved yourself a couple bucks . .

It should be noted that while getting the phosphates out of 
dishwashing detergents is a good thing, it was a political
bandaid . .

The single biggest source of phosphates is human excrement . .

Some 80% I understand . .

If you've been using the enviromental issue as an excuse
to not clean the engine compartment for the last twelve 
years, you may want to delete this message before reading. . :-)
