Subject: tamper-proof screws for taillights, etc...

Listees...

Here's something that folks who are mounting rare collectable taillights
and front turn signals will want to look at - tamper-proof screws.

In my restoration back in 94, I was ordering a lot of material from
McMaster-Carr Co., and had their hard-to-get catalog available.

They sell a large variety of tamper-proof fasteners/screws, and it seemed
like the thing to do, with turn sigs going for $80 each. The screws I
chose for mounting the front turnsigs and taillights are the flat-headed,
stainless steel, drilled-spanner types. Here's how to get to see and
order them from McMaster's online:

Go to:

http://www.mcmaster_dot_com/    and search for the word 'tamper', then click
on  'Other entries with the word &quot;Tamper&quot; ' and then click on
'Tamper-Resistant Screws'

Scroll down to the DRIVE STYLE section, choose a style (I recommend the
Tamper-Resistant Drilled Spanner), and click.
I used the Tamper-Resistant Drilled Spanner, Flat Head, 18-8
Stainless Steel, 8-32 Thread size, 1&quot; length, Part Number  94063A199.

They thread nicely into the existing taillight assemblies and front turn
sigs, at least on the '67 they do. They require the use of a matching
tool, and mine use the -

Part Number  94062A116
Drilled Spanner Driver For #8 Screw Sz, 3-1/4&quot; Blade Lg, 8-1/2&quot; O'all Lg
$ 8.28 Each,   which you find by searching on their site for 'tamper' and
following the links to 'Tamper-Resistant Drivers &amp; Nutdrivers'.

I got really anal about the whole thing, and welded up the slots in the
heads of the large headlight screws, and pan-headed them out on a lathe,
then drilled matching holes for the same driver-tool. Then of course, I
POR'ed the heads and holes so they wouldn't rust!

Okay, just figured it's time for this essay!  Keep your early taillights
from walking away in the night!
