Hey all,
Just got back from the 15th annual Spokane Bugfair and would have to say
that it was one of the worst VW shows I've attended!  For one thing there
was only one bus entered in the show.  There were plenty of buses in the
swap area, for a total of about ten buses.  The whole show had about 40
entries I'd say, but the club that runs this show trys to run it like a
big time Calif. show with real judging instead of peoples choice for all
the classes.  With small shows like that you almost have to have people's
choice for it to be any fun because there are not very many cars that are
judge worthy.  The Volkswagen Family Reunion show put on by the Bus Pilots
Association is fun for that reason.  People arn't trying to beat each
other, there just there to have fun!  And that's what it's al about,
right?  Sorry to all the people who made it to the Spokane show who had to
drive from another state.
