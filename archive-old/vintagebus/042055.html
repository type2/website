&gt; I dont understand that, If you call the local dairy they are often willing to 
&gt; give a few of them(as in you come up during daylight and ASK for them) away 
&gt; for things such as school projects, or food drives/collection centers. How 
&gt; can they know who took them and who got them free?
&gt;     If they find mine will they really charge the $1,500 dollar fine? will 
&gt; they multiply it by 20 when they see the crates?:) 

The milk companies lobbied for the penalties after they figured out that
they were losing a lot of money on crates.  At the time, crates were made
of steel and were quite expensive.  the plastic ones aren't as expensive,
but the cost still adds up.

A few years back I remenber that the milk crate police invited news
cameras along on a bust of a wrecking yard.  They had hundreds of crates
arranged on shelves with parts segregated among them.  The crate cops
gleefully dumped all the parts into one pile for the camera and even
seemed to be intentionally spreading the parts out to make it harder to
sort them again.

I still have a couple of the good 'ol all-metal crates.  It'll be pretty
hard to bust me for them though, since the dairys involved are long
defunct!
