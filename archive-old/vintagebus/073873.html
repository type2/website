Subject: Re: [VB] Type 2 Reduction Boxes

Anthony,

They should have raised part numbers on the back of the boxes
themselves.  Look closely and clean them off if needed.  Post back with
the numbers (should start off with 211 XXX XXX and someone will look
them up or you can do it yourself via the air-cooled doc project.  BTW
are they complete with axles and tubes?
