Here is what I would like to do. I currently have a '64 single port 1500
w/ 30pict1. I'd like to build up a new 1500 using the intake/carb I
currently have with a few changes.... basically I want to put together a
1500 SP longblock with all new parts, balanced, with full flow oil filter.
I would also like to change from non-doghouse to doghouse oil cooler,
and get the correct distributor and correct exhaust. I would like to
use everything else possible from my current motor, assuming nothing
is trashed. What are my options? Buy all the parts seperately and put it
together? Buy a longblock and go from there? Just looking for the best way
to end up with what I want. Thanks for all your help.
