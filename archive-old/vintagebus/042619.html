well,

i took the test and scored 54%nuts, but i think the questions are skewed
to trailer queens owners...

one question:

Assuming you own a VW, do you insist on washing it once a week? 
...once a day? 
...more than once a day? 
Would you rather wash and wax your VW than go to a party? 

i mean, i'd drag a basket case vw 400 miles, and i've driven 1200 miles to
buy a transmission, but i think i may have washed my vw once... i think...

in general about the only time i'd wash it is when it gets road salt on
it...

peas,

Steve
