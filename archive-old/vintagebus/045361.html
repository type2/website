Hey Volks

Are the front brake master cylinders interchangeable pre and post 63?

the master cylinder (under the front floor) works all the wheels, the 55 
through early 67 is single cylinder, the 67 one is dual cylinder, you can put 
a 55-63 one on a barndoor, it will work, but works better with the correct 
50-early 55 one due to cylinder diameter.

if you mean the wheel cylinders for the 55-63 buses, the answer is that if 
you have 55-63 front brakes (the dust cap does not have the nifty bit to get 
pryed off with a claw hammer)  you need to use the 55-63 cylinders which 
unfortunately cost more.    

Flush your brake system every year to extend life of hydraulic parts.
