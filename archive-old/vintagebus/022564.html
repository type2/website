Subject: early grab handle question
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990707221315.015f5a70_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I have a question about early grab handles.  On my '56, I have a grab
handle on the right side of the dash which consists of two aluminum ends
and a metal pipe in between.  I saw this on another bus, then saw a similar
handle at a swap, so I bought it and installed it.  I've thought of doing
the same for the camper.  How correct is this piece?  Was it an option?
