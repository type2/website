&gt;Sorry if I missed it in another post, but this is my first time to KP.   I 
&gt;hear that some camp in the vicinity Sat night.  Anyone care to share info 
&gt;on this?  Where?  TIA  Also, what are some simple directions when coming 
&gt;from the North on I5?

Gawd, come on guys...the man just wanted some simple information!

As far as I know, there is no one single camping area for people Saturday 
night.  The Split Bus Club is doing something 45 miles away in Santa Cruz, 
but all those spots have been spoken for.  The best thing I might be able 
to offer is to find a Big KMart or a Motel parking lot and crash out for 
the night.  Perhaps residential camping quietly?  &lt;shrugs&gt;  I luck out just 
cause I live in San Jose.

Altho, from I5 out of the North you probably want to go West on Hwy 580, 
then South on Hwy 680, then South again on Hwy 101.  The Tully Road exit 
will be what you want to take west (right) to Senter Road.  Left on Senter 
and Kelley Park will be at the corner of Phelan Ave on the left.  Now, I'm 
trying to remember exactly, but 680 to 101 South might actually drop you 
one exit too far south.  Just loop back onto 101 North if need be and exit 
at Tully.

Hope that helps!
