Subject: Interior panels --- am I crazy?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there---
I've been really thinking over the options I have on the interior of the 
cargo area on my 59' panel. I really wan't some protection of the metal back 
there and have a few options. I could build my own take of a period westy 
interior like that in Thom's '55 westy (did you build from scratch thom?). 
That would involve alot of drilling and alot more immediate work than I think 
I want? 

So I was thinking about getting some masonite from Lowe's and making my own 
panels that go the whole height of the bus (because there are no windows!). I 
would then paint these grey to match the front WW panels and cab divider. 
Would I brush or spray these? Will this look stupid? Keep in mind that this 
is going to be a nice show quality bus! I personally think it'll clean it up 
in the inside and protect that brand new paint job. 
Now for the kicker. I really don't want to drill dozens of holes into this 
fresh paint and bodywork, so, I thought up an idea and was wondering if it 
will work?
Is there a way I could get thin  magnet strips and attach these with an 
adhesive to the panels, then stick the panels onto the cargo doors/drivers 
side wall? Would they hold up the 1/8 inch masonite? This may sound crazy, 
but it's just an idea?

I guess I may need to go to the madhouse:)
Any ideas/solutions/help is appreciated
