Subject: Re: [VB] Wolfsburg West Truck Corners

Truck corners changed in 62 which is why bus and truck rear bumpers were able to be the same from 62
and later.

I have never beeen able to find out which style corners WW carry's, since they deny there was a
change in truck corners, and they have no idea what im talking about. Im sure they have the later
style ones tho, and you just proved it! =)
Although even if you did have the non-existant pre62 WW brazilian truck rear corners, im sure they
wouldnt fit right anyway and youd be shaking your head wondering what happened like I do everytime i
buy a WW body metal part. WW/brazilian parts dont fit worth crap.


Currently using WW parts to redo a bus for a friend. Tried to talk him into spending a little more
and gettin some metwiz stuff but he wouldnt go for it. After all, im doin it for free so why would
he care if it takes me longer, right?
WW jackpoints= junk
WW rockers= junk
WW short rocker = junk
WW top hats = junk
WW cargo floor = junk
Same story every time. Spend 5 times the amount of time making it fit right and modifying it and
when you get done, you wonder why you didnt just make it from scratch. Frustrating.
Ok, done venting.

&gt; I picked up an unused set of replacement truck corners at the swap
&gt; meet in Ennis this past weekend. They are Wolfsburg West and I got
&gt; them for CHEAP!!!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, holding them up to my '59 truck I'm seeing they're not right
&gt; in shape. I guess there were different corner shapes? And these fit
&gt; later trucks?
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have experience with them?
