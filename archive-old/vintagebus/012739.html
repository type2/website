&gt; Ok, so why is there no one getting these things approved?  I mean, I
&gt; understand the cost barriers on this, I understand the time and
effort
&gt; involved on this; but these things DO work better than a normal hose
It's called &quot;liability&quot;!  If they are not &quot;DOT Approved&quot; then they are
marked &quot;racing use only&quot; or &quot;off-road use only&quot;.

Of course, folks go ahead and use them on the street anyway, and some
of them will fail and some accidents will result.

When the tort lawyers come a'knockin' on the hose manufacturer's door,
they can point out that the customer wasn't using the part as it was
intended and that they have no control over the use of their product.
This provides some protection against the inevitable lawsuits that
will come to the manufacturer of any product.
