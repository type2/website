Rex,

Great job!

How about a page on your site with all your tips and experiences with painting a
two tone bus in your garage.  it would really help all those of us who are
contemplating doing the same thing.  Nothing fancy, just things you learned and
maybe a supplies and product list.

Again, really nice.  Is the red a stock color?  My color is wacky on my monitor.

&gt; Got my new tires. Just about 99.9% done with the exterior. Mainly
&gt; just some touch-ups, a little buffing, and a good wash. I took some
&gt; quick pictures even though it isn't real clean and my roof rack isn't
&gt; on. If anyone wants a look:
