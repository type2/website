Those were added by someone. They are not factory.

&gt; Remember, I am new to this stuff:
&gt; I have been watching close at backup light
&gt; configurations, and I have not seen this on anyone's
&gt; yet. Is this a special setup, or am I just not
&gt; finding anything similar.
&gt; I have this one in good condition, the other is
&gt; busted. I have replacement brake lights, but the
&gt; white backup light, is it unusual or just not used
&gt; anymore?
