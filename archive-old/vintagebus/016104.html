Hey Aaron,  probly is the same bus.  It was in the auto trader,  It was
$750 the week before when I called him.  In encinitas right?  Ryan said
something about a flip seat in the front.  So it was a Sundial, I thought
so as per the extra vents in the loading area.  No hard feelings man, 
maybe I could just see it sometime?  Are you in the sv2s club and did you
go to the bob baker show sun?   Good luck    Happy to have a 65
Sundial!!!   Jon in la mesa
