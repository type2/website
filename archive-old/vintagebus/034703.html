Subject: Busses in the shop
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I wanted to publicly thank Taylor, Ray, Strictly Vintage 2's, Volks Authority 
and everyone involved for Sunday's Busses in the shop meet.  A very nice, low 
key, social gathering, with some tasty BBQ. I had fun. Saw a few listees and 
lots of vintages busses of various condition.  By the way if you looked at 
the pictures Taylor posted last night, that's my Turkis Single Cab parked 
next to the Westy.
