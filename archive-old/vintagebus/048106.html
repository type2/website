&lt;&lt; I was wondering if the &quot;jacket&quot; that covers the expandable metal
 heater hoses that join the heater boxes to the body contains asbestos?

Hi Everett,
Not that we can tell.  Asbestos is a soft crumbly white-grayish material.  The
material on the heater tubes looks more and acts more like fiberglass cloth.
