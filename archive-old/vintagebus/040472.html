Thanks Tom,

I was aware of the later door swap - modified to re-size the handle access.  
I am trying to find some better originals.

Relating to the front clip, I have an excellent nose skin, but I need the 
boxed floor section immediately behind the lower nose.

I have not been able to get a contact e-mail/phone number for Alan Schofeld 
- so if you have (you mentioned in an earlier e-mail), that would be great.

Thank you,

Shawn

&gt;Join the club!
&gt;
&gt;Shofeld makes barndoor front floors.  If you're not overly AR,
&gt;you can use early non-barndoor doors instead of barndoor doors.
&gt;
&gt;I've been trying to find a nose clip for months with no luck.

&gt; &gt; I am hunting for a nose clip or portion for my Feb 55 Deluxe.  I also 
&gt;need
&gt; &gt; front floor sections and front driver and passenger doors.  If there are 
&gt;any
&gt; &gt; pieces - or salvage buses out there could you please drop me a line.
