Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to open pop outs

It takes a while for the new seals to take a 'set', so it's important to
get them facing the right way to start with, and then over time they'll
deform to the shape they need to be.  Use KY on the window fram and seal
in the mean time.

&gt; 
&gt; Don't know about a solution, but it's really a double-edged sword, since my
&gt; windows seal so well, at least they don't leak.  I'd be interested in a
&gt; solution to finding the balance here as well.
