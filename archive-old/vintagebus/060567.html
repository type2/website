Subject: Re: [VB] Reduction Box Theories?

I have not done this, but I don't see why there would be any problems.
AFAIK, the axle shafts are the same 55- 67, and the tubes bolt on the same, 
and the RGBoxes bolt to the spring plates the same.

The only thing I would be careful of is the fulcrum plates.   They were 
changed in late 59 (after the change to synchros tranny) and the earlier ones 
if you lay the curved side on a flat surface do not rock end to end.  The 
later ones when checked the same way do rock end to end.  Just make sure you 
have the same kind on each side of a particular axle shaft spade end.  I 
mentioned this as it's usuall to keep the best FPs to put in your tranny.

r/p gearing of the split case is slightly higher than 4.38, if I remember 
right.

&lt;&lt; Is it possible (meaning has anyone actually done it)
 to put the large nut style reduction box assemblies,
 including the axle tubes, on split case trannies to
 give a better final drive ratio? I can't see a reason
 why they wouldn't bolt up to both the transmission and
 the spring plates. The axles should be the same
 (length), so if everything is the same length and uses
 the same bearings for the axle (coming out of the
 transmission/ the top 2 bearings), why not? And if it
 CAN be done (meaning someone has done it), are there
 any things were a problem? I really don't want to go
 throught the troubles of putting a later trans in and
 all the B.S. of the whole front mount thing. Any
 thoughts, comments, suggestions would be appreciated.
