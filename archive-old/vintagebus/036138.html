 While I had the rear end up, I ran the engine and put the bus through the 
gears.  Fourth gear at idle...man.  Sitting up front, it sounded like the 
pass. rear wheel was launching a Saturn V.  Push-pull on the wheel revealed 
around 1mm of play.  I'm thinkin' that gearbox needs a bearing or two.  The 
tranny pops out of second and howls horrendously in fourth, so I'm thinking 
I'll just drive on it and ignore the RGB for now.  Thoughts on this?  I can't 
afford new bearings, but I have a spare big-nut tranny under the porch that 
might have better ones.  Worth the trouble for a languishing tranny?

 you can leave it running and stand by ech rear wheel and compare the sounds 
it makes.   really all you can do w/o pulling it apart is change the oil, 
which definately helps it last longer. Get a gallon of GL-4 tranny oil.   
Make sure your boots are good, drain the center section and both RGBoxes.  
Put the gallon of gear oil in a bucket of hot wtaer so it thins and pumps 
easier.    change the boots now if they are ripped or cracked or torn.   put 
your finger in the drain holes and check for sludge if it has been forever 
since the oil was changed.  clean the drain plugs of shavings and reinstall 
the center section drain plug and one RGBox.  Fill that box with oil, put in 
fill plug, put wheel back on, put on ground.  repeat for other side.  Fill 
center section last.  when it starts to come out the fill hole, wait a few , 
then top it off till it starts to ooze out.  This'll help you choose when you 
want to change trannys.

check out what came out of the tranny, and checks of metal, or just shavings? 
 does the oil have that coppery sheen of worn syncho material in it?  sludge?
