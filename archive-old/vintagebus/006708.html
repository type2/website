 I guess you missed the once only issue of VW CLASSICS magazine, it came out
about a month ago and was dedicated to the air cooled VW and it's drivers.
There was also a cool artical on Buses by the Bridge, this was a one try
only summer issue but if they get enough imput from the true VW air cooled
crowd they might publish a Fall issue and who knows maybe go back to a
monthly. Lets hope so, I am also tired of the way to many cheap trash ads
and 1 sided tech articals in VW Trends and Hot VW's, I could basically make
up some tech one sided bulls#hit, pay a 1 year ad rate and get it published
selling some half as#ed product, it's amazing how people can totally belive
the bul##hit published in these rags, thanks to the list and it's many
members for calling bul##hit on half of those so called tech articals, it's
amazing what money can buy.

Subject: VW Trends Sucks!!!


The last couple subscriptions I have gotten from VW Trends really suck.  It
is quite apparent that Henry DeKuyper, the former editor and bus owner has
stepped down, and some California kid has stepped in.  The only good
seasoned veteran they have left as far as I know is Dave Cormack, who loves
aircooled busses and all that goes with them.

It wouldn't surprise me at all to know that this new editor has neon lights
dangling from the underside of his pink watercooled beetle.  Can anyone
confirm this?

On the cover of the latest issue there is a watercooled speedster smoking
it's tires while sitting still.  The guy inside is grinning like a mule
eating briars through a picket fence......like he's doing something special.
His daddy probably bought his damned tires for him.  I am beginning to wish
I had never subscribed.

To top it all off, they (TRENDS) apparently sold my name to some company
that sends me periodic catalogs that caters more to the watercooled pieces
of crap that look just like every other car on the road today.

Someone should start up a magezine dedicated to the aircooled driver.  There
is still plenty of market for it out there.  If this is VW's Trend, I will
stay with the old school thought and what gottem there.  AIRCOOLED forever!

Thanks for tolerating the rantlings, I'M PISSED!  GIVE ME MY DAMN MONEY
BACK!
