Thom,
I can't speak directly to that radio, but many of the AM/FM/SW radios used
the small effective length of the antenna and tuned it in the radio.  It is a
marginal solution at best, the antenna allow you to receive the stronger
broadcast stations. It would be difficult to drag along an efficient antenna
for the SW band, somehow 10 meters of wire sticking out of the bus may work
at the fishing hole but not for daily driving.  And most people are allergic
to the wound loaded antennas used by hams for the low frequency bands.  If
you test it during the day time you are likely to be disappointed.  Once the
sun goes down, the entire SW band changes and all of a sudden you will start
hearing the stronger broadcasts from Europe and Central America.

SW does mean short wave and in 'olden times' everyone was on SW.  You could
tune in taxis, the local police department and who know what else.  Now a
days, about all that you will find there are the big world wide broadcasting
stations,  Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, etc.

On a similar note, I have an early '30s vintage Zenith that covers the SW
band that I got from my grandfather.  I got it fixed up and working.  Every
time I turn it on, I half expect some of the old time broadcasts to start
playing as if they had been captured in some sort of a time machine.

Have fun and report back with your DX reports (ham'ese for long distance
contacts)
