Subject: Soto is not dead, just in bad shape
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Mark knows its not dead.........

Ok so Dave does not do much.......

Well I would like to go to 2 meets in June . SOTO and the much better OCTO

But Dave Heard will probably  try to have his meet the same day again, and he 
will lose again.......

if he had it a diffurent day all the buses guys would be there too, Kimball, 
Charlie, and the rest of them......But since it is not advertised ANYWHERE it 
looks like Dave is doing his usual.....NOTHING

Hey I printed up flyers and had them given out for 2 years in a row at 
Bug-O-rama etc, because Dave was too lazy to do it himself.........

and thats why OCTO started........the love of buses.... and the neglect of 
Dave to promote his own show.........

See you at OCTO........and SOTO if it is not the same day.............
