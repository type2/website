Subject: [VB] Beetlemex stuff; VW of SA connection?


I've just spent some time poking around in the Btlmex_dot_com site, which =
raises
some questions.

1. =A0Does anyone have any experience with Beetlemex's &quot;Brand new =
=A8Turn-Key=A8
Complete Engine&quot;? =A0The engine appears to be carbureted, but the photo =
on
their web page
&lt; =A0http://www.btlmex_dot_com/product.asp?0=3D201&amp;1=3D210&amp;3=3D34 =A0&gt;=20
is so poor that it's hard to tell. =A0It also appears to have a =
generator
rather than an alternator, which seems odd for a VW of Mexico brand new
production engine. =A0

2. =A0Among the various parts Beetlemex sells they list &quot;OEM =
Heaterboxes&quot;.
=A0Does anyone have experience with these HEs? =A0The price [$45.25 =
each] is
certainly attractive, but not if they're lighweight, poor quality =
junk...

3. =A0Beetlemex seems to function as a quasi-official connection for =
parts
available from VW of Mexico. =A0Is there a company in the USA or South =
Africa
that does something similar for parts available from VW of South =
Africa?

Inquiring minds, etc.....
