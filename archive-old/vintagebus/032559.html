Subject: RE: [VB] wiring harness question
Date: Tue, 29 May 2001 15:30:47 -0700
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

as i used to chant,  &quot;the wires don't care&quot;.  just like 6v spark plugs. 
what year is the bus.  i know retail on a 55-63 is somewhere around 250,
but i've seen them for less. it depends who you get them from. wiring works
makes them, sorry no website or email.


&gt; [Original Message]
 
&gt; Will a wiring harness for a 6v system work the same as a 12v? I am pretty
&gt; sure a wire doesn't give a crap what voltage travels through it, as long
as
&gt; the amperage for the specific guage is not exceeded. Any comments? Anyone
&gt; know what a good price for a new harness should set me back? TIA   Jon
