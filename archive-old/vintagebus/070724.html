Subject: Re: [VB] re:shifting problems 

Thanks for the reply Mike,

I got the a shift coupler from Heritage, and it was mexican and the screw
holes did not line up correctly at each end, so I got one from the SSVC which
appeared to be better.  I will get the Heritage one back off my friend who was
gonna try it on his to see what that one is like.

I shall have to check to see if the gear coupler is hitting the cross member -
and maybe I need to modify my shift plate so I get more forward motion.

One thing though, wouldn't reverse be difficult to get into as well as 2nd and
4th?

Regards
Paul

  Hi paul
  The pin can be changed for a bay one. Geuss how I know. The shift plate you
can adjust backwards will make 1st and 3rd harder to engage forwards 2nd and
4th.  Also make shure that all the parts are seated correctly, The front  the
Make shure that rear gear change linkage is not hitting on the cross member
and that the bush at the front still has a bit of travel left at the end of
its rod. New gear linkages are available from VW Heritage its the same as a
pre 64 Beetle if my memory serves me correct. Let me know how you get on. Mike
