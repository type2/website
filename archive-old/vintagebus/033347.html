Subject: Re:  [VB] Backing plates, what to do?
To: paulcwilliamson_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have rebuildt brakes with success.   You do need to have wheel cylinders 
that do not have pits.  Use a brake hone.  If they have pits the fluid will 
seep past the new seals and cause brake problems.  if yours are original they 
are probably in this state.    If you are unsure about how to do this, buynew 
ones.

make sure your backing plates all have the spring tabs that hold the brake 
star from turning.  If the brake stars self turn, your brakes self deadjust.  
 :(    You can get the pieces off bay window bus backing plates.  I have 
happily transfered the bit with the springs off rear bay backing plates onto 
split backing plates.   Dunno about the fronts.

I'd get them powder coated semi gloss black.   then again, I haven't 
bothered, and just rattle canned mine.  But I woud like to have mine powder 
coated.  It would be neato.
..............................................
I just dismantled all four brakes of my doublecab to
start the brake system replacement/resto.  I
sandblasted one of the backing plates, and was pretty
happy with the results, so I'll probably do the others
when I can.  Question is what should I do for the
newly sandblasted backing plates?  I figured I have
three options: Powder coating, Zinc primed and
rattle-canned, or POR-15.  (What color?  I thought
plain old gloss black)  There is no rust, so I'm not
really inclined to do the POR-15 route.  This will be
my daily ride, so I wanted the coating to last, what
ever it may be.  Also, should I try to rebuild the
cylinders, or just buy new ones?  These are the
original ones.  I've already purchased all new brake
lines, hoses, shoes for the rear, and springs for the
rear.  I'll probably be ordering the stuff for the
front in the next few weeks, as money comes available.
