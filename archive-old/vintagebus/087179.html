Subject: Re: What ever happened to the bus boat?

&gt; I have owned a bus boat for about 13 years now.
&gt; I have been looking for someone who can help me
&gt; reproduce them but haven't found anyone yet.
&gt; Is there anyone out there who can help me?

Contact a local kayaking business, the older the
better. It was common a few decades ago to copy a boat
to make a mold and make your own from the mold.

The newer kayaks are roto-molded thermosetting plastic
rather than fiberglass, so you want to find a shop
that knows and understands fiberglass. Some of the
ocean, surf, and scuba support kayaks are still
fiberglass. 

Perhaps check with a kayaking club, there may be some
folks that used to be involved with making homemade
kayaks who might be interested in such a project.

Newer materials (carbon fiber) could result in a
lighter and stronger boat than the original!

Since you are in the SF bay area, at least one older
kayak shop should be in the area.

Jeff - with no bus now but who used his '64 Deluxe as
a kayak hauler back in the 80's (wish I still had the
bus) and who would love to have a VW boat to top a
sunroof bus
