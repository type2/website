You are going to be hard pressed to find any sort of agreement when it comes to air cooled vw folks. What I have done in the past is to get as much infor from as many people as I can and try and make my decision from there. I agree that it is very frustrating when half the people say &quot;if you do that your motor will die
tomorow&quot; and half the people say that &quot;if you do that and your motor will go 300,000miles&quot;. With the info I found, I came to the conclusion that I wanted a higher hp motor (1776) and therefore wanted some higher gearing. I went with the freeway flyer with reduction boxes to maintain the stock ride height. I used to take my
Crew Cab up skiing all the time and ground clearance was more of an issue. My tranny cost about $650. By the time you lower the back end and then lower the front to match and do all of the stuff it takes to really complete this task I think you will find that the cost is about the same.
Good luck making your decision,
Craig
