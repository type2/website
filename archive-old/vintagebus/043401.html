&gt;There's an ashtray sittin' up by the windshield, but
&gt;no cigarette lighter in the dash.

I think VW assumed that bars and restaurants would
be giving away matchbooks forever.  A lot of them don't
anymore, and if you hold a match to the end of your
cell phone charger, it just melts...  In their defense,
even now, it's not a felony offense to smoke in Germany
(like it is in California) so bars and restaurants still
pass out matchbooks freely...

&gt;I should have a place to plug in my cel phone charger
&gt;(seein' as I live in Southern California and all).

Others have posted good ideas on where to stick it;
I like the radio-blockoff-plate idea (iff you have
an already-munged blockoff plate).  Another idea would
be to use the L-bracket mount, and get a slightly longer
screw for your headlight or wiper switch, and use that
to mount the L-bracket.  (Must be tight, to prevent
rotation of the bracket and paint scratches.)

Wire it to the top end of your far right fuse (the
contact that still has power even with the fuse gone
and the ignition off).  Put a 15 or 20A fuse in the
hot wire to the lighter, and use 14 gauge wire minimum.
(Your cell charger doesn't draw more than an amp or so
but if you ever use the lighter element it will draw
quite a bit.)  Also run a ground wire to the lighter...
some are designed to ground through the bracket and that
never works right.  One of the parcel-tray bolts would
be a good place for the ground wire.

If you only occasionally use the cell-phone (yeah
right), buy a lighter &quot;extension cord&quot; and cut off
the socket end, leaving a foot or so of wire.  Put
small alligator clips on each wire and then you can
just hook it up when you need it.  I did this for
a long trip in my Dad's '74 Bug before I got the
radio installed...I used the socket to power a 12v
boom box in the passenger seat.  And yes, they sell
sockets with clips ready made, but the clips are huge
(for battery terminals) and are liable to short things
out if you try to use them at the fuse box.

Good luck!
