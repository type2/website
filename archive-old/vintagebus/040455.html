I can say for certain that Ken Hooper, who mastered the CD is a Machead, or is that McHead? The sermons work on both Mac and Windows, sort of a bi-computeral deal. Hey, has anyone tried the new McMac sandwich? ;) Joe (wish I was a Unix geek, but I'm stuck with JoOS, the windows alternative that requires you to move jumpers inside your computer just to compose an e-mail...talk about open architecture!)

&gt;Erin's post reminded me I forgot to ask if
&gt;the sermons can be seen on a Mac.
