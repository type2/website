Subject: Southern journys

Hey guys,
I'm leaving Vancouver Is thursday night to head down to SoCal. If someone
needs something delivered along the way, heres a chance to get it for
free(well if you hand me a cold beer I wouldnt refuse)

Heres the deal-leaving Naniamo 10p thurs night, driving mostly straight thru
to Riverside, so if you happen to be somewhere along the 5 corridor in
wash,oregon or cali and dont care what time we hook up, I'll have a mostly
empty astro going south, reasonable limits apply, be somewhere close to the
freeway on both ends,nothin illegal or stolen- yada yada-sorry- same deal
dosnt apply comeing north, will have trailer, rugrat and junk. If it works
for you email me before thurs.
Chuck
