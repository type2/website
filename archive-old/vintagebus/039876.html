do you need any relief milkers?

(from Matt)  ALWAYS!!! I'm up at 3:00 am, and go to 10:30 _at_ night
I work over 80 hrs a week, sometimes those weeks consist of 50 hr days, 
(figure that one out!)
(but its always nice to know in the world of (farming) technology and 
complexity, that I can always come home to a nice and simple, yet practical 
and lovable VW, (not dissing my Chevy work vehicles mind you!).  My vehicles 
(Chevies, VWs, international and oliver tractors( and a johndeere skid 
loader w/ a diesel VW engine in it)) are all very special to me, and they 
all get along fine with a little TLC, I cant complain about any of them, 
(except maybe the dumptruck...(Ford...))
see ya Matt
