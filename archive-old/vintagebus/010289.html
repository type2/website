sorry i wasnt clear on that, i did say that i talked to him and he has more,
for that matter if you find anything on ebay , it is worth emailing the
seller and asking him if he has others at the starting bid price for sale,
alot of times they do and you can get it right away, or get an even better
price

jb/ alabama


&gt; It only comes witht he pin and bushings.  BTW, don't kill yourselves
bidding
&gt; on this - call the guy up and he'll sell you as many as you want at that
price.
