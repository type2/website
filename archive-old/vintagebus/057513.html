Subject: door hinge

'64 lower front door hinge. from drivers door. off now.
not really rusty but frozen solid.  cant do a thing with it.
Drive pin out? no way, wont budge. Drill it? Ha it must be made of
kryptonite. cant even scratch it. Ive tried pretty much everything
including extreme heat and penetrants. so.
Any ideas? Or another hinge?
thanks
