Subject: mystery tranny

ok, i have archived, libraried and googled... nada.
i am looking for the identity of a tranny i started to clean up; it has
five ribs, a 091 part # and - oddest of odd - an early bay bellhousing
bolted on it! it was in a 71. sort of a poor-man's freeway flier i reckon.

the tranny # is:  CP 02 09 6.

none of my books have it either.

i need gear ratios to determine how bad an idea  ;)  it is to strap this in
to my 1600dp, at least until i can get the present CORRECT tranny rebuilt.


some T2 folks have suggested a diesel tranny, but their numbers start with
ACP, so who knows?




Mike V stated he had one (whatever it was), and:
The R&amp;P is a 4.57 as compared to a 5.38 in the upright bays.

002 tranny = .82 4th
091 tranny = .88 4th

Stock .82 * 5.38 = 4.4 final ratio
091   .88 * 4.57 = 4.0 final ratio


He did say his was a 091, and not the 5 rib 002, but as they changed ratios
over the years, i'd like to nail it down exactly.
