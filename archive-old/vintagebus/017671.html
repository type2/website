Hi list,

Back in my landlubber days, I remember a 
5 cly aircooled deutz in the corner of the shop
I was fascinated by it.
so i was daydreaming and did a LOL search.....
i found this site with a air cooled diesel:

now because its Friday, I *dare* some nut 
out there to put one in his bus...

Aloha

Ken
