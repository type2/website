Subject: RE: [VB] Laminated diagram

   James wrote Girding my loins in preparation of replacing the wiring 
harness,
   took a color diagram from Vintagebus, went to Staples with it, had
   it blown up to approx 12&quot;x15&quot; and laminated.  Wont get greasy or
   wrinkled, easy to read, and will fit behind my passenger's kickpanel
   when done.  As Martha says, &quot;It's a good thing.&quot;  Wife's idea,
   actually.

James did you just print it out at home or take it on disc? How much did 
this set you back? Great Idea!

Michael Knight
