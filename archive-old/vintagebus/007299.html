I found it very interesting as I sat at Ronnie's computer at his shop that
the phone number for Schofield's is written on a yellow post-it note pad and
is stuck to the bottom shelf just to the right of the computer.  I thought
of taking a picture of it but decided against it as I didn't know if it was
some super-secret hotline direct to Alan or not and wanted to respect
Ronnie's privacy.  I was however quite amused at the thought of what
Ronnie's phone bill is like. :-)
