gas from the station is colder, and will expand after you put it in your tank.
15 miles isn'tvery far, so the slight incline could well let it slop over the
top.   Maybe fill it a tad less next time.Hi,

I have had a funny thing happen. I filled the gas tank. That's not the weird
part. A day later, I returned to the bus and smelled gas. I looked in the
engine bay and saw nothing but the smell was stronger. I looked in the
filler area and found a pool of gas. It was not draining down the drain tube
because it was blocked but that is not the problem. I opened the gas cap and
found the level of gas right to the brim and overflowing. It was like
someone snuck up the my bus and stuck an extra gallon into it. I had already
driven 15 miles since the fillup. What gives? Yes, I was parked at a slight
incline but not like the bus was on its side. 
 
Has this happened to anyone else? Do air pockets develop in the lower area
of the tank causing the level to rise?

Bob
