Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Thanks, Ray !
With the pressures I got with the 26mm pump,
what can I expect to see with a 30mm pump
in stock flow, and how much do you think I will
drop with the full-flow ? Why does it drop ?

I just don't understand why you can't get good
pressure once the lines and filter are full of oil.
I'm using steel-core high-pressure hydraulic lines,
and they are quite sturdy.

I'm not finding much information on factory
specs for oil pressure.

Without Guesswork lists a few specs for oil,
including : SAE 30,new installation, 1500 engine-
42psi at 158F _at_2500 rpm, wear limit 28 psi.

Bentley offers 28.5psi at 158F _at_ 2500 rpm,
and 7.1psi engine warm, with SAE 20 oil.
I assume that is for the 1500, but not sure.
( Section M-14, page 2. )

There are specs for the oil pressure contriol
and relief spring measurements, &quot;length loaded&quot;
and &quot;load&quot; but those are too cryptic to be of any use.

I'm using an AE case, and I'm sure I'm past
the max pressures with a new engine.
I think the size of the oil return hole is limiting the effective
pressure relief back to the case from the control piston
so I am able to defeat the system even with 26mm geras.

I would like to see some specs for the 30mm pump.

Here's what John Yust reports about the 1/2&quot; lines.
To answer his question, the Oberg oil filter is a split
cast aluminum with a 3 or 5 or 15 micron screen of
stainless steel woven wire, and has a bypass
and a dash indicator light for when it is time to clean.
It has considerably less volume than a spin-on filter.

&gt; I think I have 1/2&quot; hoses on my system and I have good oil pressure. I
&gt; get about 20-25 psi at idle and 45 psi warmed up and running. I can't
&gt; think of any reason why a 1/2&quot; hose would be a problem. It isn't all
&gt; that big. It must be something with the filter. It sounds like a huge
&gt; pressure drop across the filter. What does an Oberg have inside it? Have
&gt; you thought about trying a regular filter mount and a spin-on filter? I
&gt; use a Mobile 1 filter on mine. Besides the filter, it sounds like the
&gt; same oil filter setup I'm using.
&gt;
&gt; I almost 100% sure I have 1/2&quot; hoses with 1/2-3/8 JIC fittings on the
&gt; end. I found fittings that had very little reduction in the ID. 3/8 JIC
&gt; is still pretty big.

Those 1/2&quot; lines scare me. If I was using a blue printed 30mm oil pump I
would still not use 1/2&quot; lines. 3/8&quot; is as big as I will go to maintain oil
pressure.
