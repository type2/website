Subject: RE: [VB] Parts needed

Okay,  I correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that my bus is early '65 as
it has the early front beam for that year.  Either way I had no luck finding
the rear tin with the hole on the right side and probably won't be able to
find the tube that goes on the left to match the rear tin I do have.  Maybe
I can fudge it until KP where I can maybe find one in the swap.  Anyone have
a pic of the left side tube to help me pick it out from the tin piles?
