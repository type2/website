 It doesn't take long to sort out a balanced approach, erring on the safe
 side if there's any doubt.  Drive and think ahead of your location/position,
 maintaining a reserve of slowing/stopping capability for unforeseen
 contingencies [blocking accident, deer in the road, the dreaded falling
 rocks].
 
 Certainly, brake shoes/pads are cheaper than transaxles or engines, but a
 decent funeral costs more than the whole bus!
 
  &gt;&gt;
just to clarify things, At one point I was tending to downshift to help slow 
down in regular driving, noit just going down steep grades.  Decided that was 
not a good idea, just excessive wear on the trans, which would be better to 
be taken by the brakes.  I was actually living in the Santa Cruz mountains, 
and regularly cruised the windy steep mountain roads with hill up on side and 
ravine on the other.  The road I lived on every one else took in 1st gear, 
only the bus with the split case tranny took it in 2nd.

Howver I guess my steering was good and you get used to those roads, and 
never rode the brakes going down 9 or 17, usually was on the gas.  It's fun.
