Subject: Seattle vintage weekend

Can anyone provide info about the Seattle vintage
weekend? I ave been to the Cascade Kombi's website, so
I am aware of the Burger Meet and the Vintage show
Saturday, but I have not been able to find any info
about a show on Sunday at SIR. Is there one on Sunday?
It's a long way to drive a bus for a one day thing and
I'd like to know beforehand if it's gonna be worth the trip.
