Subject: Re: [VB] Sad News

&gt;I'll put my wager on a really big April fool's joke....



nope - this was reported in what, vwtrends? a few years ago... they toured
the vw plant in puebla, and officials there flatly stated  that the line
would shut down in 2002.

i believe they are required to manufacture parts for 5 years, then nada.

start stocking up!!!
