Hey Happy Holidays to everyone........I received an email from a guy
from Business Week magazine a couple days ago wanting to ask questions
about our beloved micros. .....He told me VW is coming out with a New
Micro? He wanted to know what made the original so popular and what I
thought about a New bus coming out..... kinda cool.. I was just
wondering who else he contacted........I didn't even ask himwhen the
feature would come out! DUH! Must have been brain freeze. You'll have
that when it's 40 below and you've got snow up to your a$$!!!!!!! Wel
hey, everyone have a safe and happy new years celebration...See Ya
