Subject: MORE on the Clutch Spring

Ok volks, I STILL haven't gotten that friggen spring on and because I
consider you all good friends I feel I can confide in you.  That damn
thing got away from me and thunked  me in the forehead over my right
eye.  I have a heck of a welt now highlighted by a grease streak.  Other
than my wife laughing at me there is no love in the house right now.
Now on to some other biddnes.  I'm looking at bushing that goes next to
the arm (the one held in place by the screw and it seems to long.  It
sticks out to far to the right.  The retention clip can not make it into
it's grove.  I have banged the shite out of the lever and she won't go
any further (story of my life).  Now the bushing that came out was only
half the size of the new one.  Me thinks this may be a new and improved
version but maybe it's the wrong version.  My tranny is a 6 volt ground
out for a 12 volt flywheel.  Are there two different bushings for 6 and
12 volt versions?  I'm going to go drink beer and hold the bottle
against my eye now.

Subject: [VB] Clutch Spring


I installed a new clutch lever and now I'm trying to get the spring back
on.  Is there a trick to this because so far this task has been a pain
in the arse.  TIA!
