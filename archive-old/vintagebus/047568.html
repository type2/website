I know that Wolfsburg West does repros these
Like their front floor mats, the tops are of very high quality, but they lack 
the honeycomb webbing on the bottom side. I assume the cargo mats are like 
this. I think that any floor mat until 1974? works as the mat is the same 
repro _at_ WW.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

As for interior panels, I'm thinking of putting them in my panel, but id have 
to make them? I talked to a guy _at_ WW who said they have the grey fibreboard 
material (that's what my front panel are) in bulk sheets which measure 48&quot; by 
52&quot; .  Would this be large enough? I wanted to put up a hardboard headliner 
in 2 sections in the cargo area but I don't think this will fit. Does anyone 
have suggestions?
