In all the years I've been on these Lists, this weekend sets a new record
for the smallest number of messages posted.

I hope everyone is safe, well, and happy!

[OBC]  As I returned to Tacoma this evening I spotted a high-top early
baywindow camper on the freeway's [SR 16] inside shoulder, just before the
westbound Union Ave. exit ramp.  I circled back on the freeway heading the
other way but was unable to reach the vehicle because of extremely heavy
traffic.  If you recognize your rig and the predicament, I'm sorry I wasn't
able to assist.

FWIW.....
