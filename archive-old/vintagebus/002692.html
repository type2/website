 Folks sorry for the off topic post , i'm in the middle of haggling with a
man over the price of leasing a 3000 sq/ft shop, and have been since friday
so if you e-mailed me and i haven't responded please hang in there, i'm
busier than a long tail cat in a room full of rockin chairs but should be
caught up hopefully by tonite on mail, i'll post results of the haggling as
soon as it works or i give the hell up one or the other. If all else fails
(336)-434-4259,,later
