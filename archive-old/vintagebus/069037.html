Subject: Blue Split Fever

After 2 years as a bay window owner, I have finally (or will be on
Sat) adding a split to my VW collection. It's a 66 Westy SO-42
non-walk thru camper. I'm quite excited about it. Plus it's a b-day
present from my wife! 

Any suggestions on moving back in time to a split? Obviously the
normal bus rules apply (slow) which isn't a problem, just wanted any
suggestions or comments on differences between my busses other than
the obvious cosmetic changes.  I'm driving to KY sat so that I can
pick it up &amp; drive it back. I was planning to bring my normal travel
parts box with things such as distributor, points, timing light, etc. 
Anybody got anything other ideas that would be split specific?

I'm sure I'll be posting some q's here, but for now just though I had
to tell someone. :)
