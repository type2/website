Subject: RE: [VB] Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

The past week or so, the wife and I were really thinking about heading up for the weekend.  She heads back to work at the end of April, and we we hoping to get out and about before doing so.

With all this negative talk.....I am definately reconsidering the trip.  I just can't see driving that far and not being able to get into the show.  Camping with a wife and two kids....the word 'early' left my vocabulary years ago!

Now the question is--Corona de Tuscon or SV2's club campout??

&gt; Ah yes, but will BYOB have any room??  I heard they might move the car show
&gt; part to make more room for the swap. Remember how big IT was last year? This
&gt; year will be even bigger as a lot of people I know who didn't come last year
&gt; will be coming this year. At least at the Red Barn there is plenty of room
&gt; to expand.
