I was one of the 2 busses at Busses by the Arch in 1998 with the A/C unit in
the window, and the installation was mentioned in the article by enry
DeKuyper.   I'll be glad to discuss it off forum if more information is
needed.  It was in a bay window, however, not in a split.  The other was a
Vanagon.
