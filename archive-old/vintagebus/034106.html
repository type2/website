I use a PVC tube, capped off on 1 end with a hole cut in the side for my
sync tool to fit in, works like a dream, now if I could only find it again.

Has anyone come across a sync tool that works properly with Dual Kadrons? I 
picked up an 1835 built by Fisher Buggies(yuk) with Kadrons(yuk) , and I'm 
not prepared  yet to put on a decent set of Webers.
