&lt;&lt;- also, I'm trying to use a set of empi shocks and some have already told me
 that they won't fit but that hasn't stopped me from trying ;-)  &gt;&gt;

Hi David,
That is correct!

&lt;&lt;anyway, the shocks are basically 1 inch or so too long so the question
 becomes how frequently or likely is it to bottom out the front suspension in
 *normal* driving conditions.&gt;&gt;
If you load it up and especially stop or turn suddenly you will risk 
bottoming out!  Plus the shocks you have look like they are for 65 and later 
bug.  So they are too soft for a bus and the top mounts of these shocks are 
completely differant from a bus top shock mount.  So you would have to cut 
and weld a type 1 top shock mount on your bus front suspension to just get 
them to fit.   Eric&amp;Barb
