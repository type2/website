&lt;&lt; where could the gas have come from I'm assuming  by gravity the gas found

Hi Angel,
It could be the fuel pump rod is too high and due to this is overpressurizing 
the reseviour bowl float down and shut off valve open when the engine is 
running.  And/or it could be the shut off valve is sticking open and/or the 
float has leaked or is just too heavy to push the valve shut when the fuel 
level is high enough.  Which would cause fuel to over flow the resevior bowl 
and dribble down the carb throat when the engine is running or not and 
leaking past the cylinder rings into the oil.  Best first to drain the oil 
and turn the engine by hand to make sure none of the cylinders have fluid in 
them to cause interferance and cause a bent rod!   Eric&amp;Barb
