Hi Ted,
Unless you have a 1966 or later bus one can use either a three prong or two
prong 12 or 6 volt flasher relay from your FLAPS.  The three wires in your bus
will work with the three prong relay easily after you figure which wire goes
where and if you use the two prong type you will have to have two of your
wires go to one of the prongs to function properly.   Eric &amp; Barb
