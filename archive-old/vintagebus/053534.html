Subject: ADMIN: Virus reporting to the lists. DONT.


Ok, this has really gone on long enough.

STOP.  If you get a virus, DO NOT EMAIL THE type2 or vintagebus (or, for
that matter, any other list you happen to be on) mailing lists about it.

Chances are roughly about 10,003:1 that it didnt come through our
listservers, and instead came directly from whoever else is infected.

Feel free to email the original sender of the message in question.  Feel
free to run your own favorite antivirus software.  Feel free to use email
software that automaticly opens and executes attachments.

But DO NOT tell the lists about it.

One more message abour viruses and I'm liable, with the backing of the
rest of the group, to add a 100% bounce filter on the word &quot;virus&quot;...but
I'd really rather not.
