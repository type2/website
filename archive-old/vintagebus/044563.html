Subject: More shift rod questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Jim,

I just today finally got my shift rod apart.  It is the 2 screw kind, and I 
had to cut it into six pieces to remove it!  Heat just didn't do anything.

In doing so, I found that if you remove the shifter from the front, and the 
front grub screw from the rear coupler, you can slide the whole assembly 
forward to get a lot more room to work.  Clara's right, once you get the 
screw out, just twist away!

Good luck (from someone who was just there)!

JP
