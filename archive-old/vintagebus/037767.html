Subject: Sundial camper?

Hello all.  I found a sundial camper at
http://home.inreach_dot_com/tmrj/bus/bus.html and was wondering about the rarity or
it.  This 65 is a double door which brings up a question.  Do campers start out
as a panels or kombis?  The way this one looks it might just be a double door
panel with the camper equipment installed.  On one of the pics it looks like it
only has windows on the doors....  Anyway, the owner says it has never been
wrecked and has no rust so maybe it is worth the $3700.  I am driving to Las
Vegas next week so I might just drive a bit further to LA and check it out.  Any
comments or advice is welcome.  I've been looking for a decent bus for 8 weeks
now!
