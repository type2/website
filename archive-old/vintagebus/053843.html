&gt;&gt;&quot;Cars can be dangerous and deadly weapons.  They kill more people by
&gt;&gt; accident than are shot on purpose.&quot; - Muir, page 6, 16th edition
&gt;
&gt;That probably isn't true anymore...

Don't believe everything you see on TV.  Starting from 
http://webapp.cdc_dot_gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcaus.html , take the defaults
and click &quot;submit request&quot;.  In the far right column you'll see that
&quot;Unintentional Injury and Adverse Effects&quot; was the 5th leading cause
of death in 1998 for all age groups combined.  If you click on that
blue box, you get a breakdown which includes:

Motor Vehicle Traffic  42,191  43.1%
Firearm                   866   0.9%

Of course, this is for the United States only.  If you include other
places in the world like Colombia, Northern Ireland, the Middle East,
and California, the relative proportions are probably different.
