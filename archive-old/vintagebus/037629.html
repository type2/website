Subject: Re: engine hatch/model year 


     VW did create some confusion when it chose for  its designation of 
     model year (rather than  a calendar year)  a &quot;working year&quot;. The 
     latter, beginning after completion of the summer shut-down, commenced, 
     with an occasional hiccup  in August 
     
     ---------------
     
     Actually, this was an industry change.  The auto makers were trying to 
     increase sales in the traditionally slow winter months.  So they 
     decided to release the new models in September instead of January.  
     The change worked and we've been stuck with it industry-wide since.
