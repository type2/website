Howdy Volks.

As some of my posts have suggested, and Thom's review of the truck before I
purchased, the wiring on my '63 crew was pretty messy.  An incomplete 6v to
12v conversion and a lot of disconnected wires.  The fuse block is cracked
and hanging 2 inches below the holding frame :)

My turn signals and brake lights would cut out entirely at times.  This
required emergency study and correction.  I had hooked up a volt meter
directly off the coil + feed, and it drops about 1 volt whenever the brakes
or turn signals are on.  This was a good way to determine if the brake
lights were working or not.  This way I wasn't going to drive around without
assurance that the brake lights were not working!  Without this assurance,
I'd have been unwilling to drive while still troubleshooting this
intermittent problem.

Anyway -- other problems existed, including no working lights on the speedo.
Could not read speed or miles at night :)  Also had no working turn signal
light on the speedo, which made the failure of &quot;real&quot; turn signals difficult
to see before I put the volt meter in.

Oh yha, the wipers would blow the fuse on a damp morning...  And the fuel
gauge wires are yet to be found :)

I'm still learning and not ready to take on the whole wiring harness.  The
wires aren't neat but pretty well run and reasonably safe.  I corrected one
or two wires that weren't run in the safest matter... and decided to take on
what was critical.  Disconnected battery to do all this work... done over
various days.  I cleaned contacts with steel wool, making sure to not leave
any residual on the wires.

  1)  The turn signals were first.  The connector on the fuse box seemed
dirty and appears to be the source of the intermittent failure of both brake
lights and turn signal.  This was determined by jumping a temporary wire
from the fuse block to the signal and it would work 100%.  So cleaned
connectors on both ends of the wire.

  2)  The lack of speedo lighting was the result of a blown 6v bulb in
there, replaced with a new 12v bulb and cleaned contacts.  The socket is on
the left side of the speedo, reaching behind from the left side.  Just pull
out and clean contacts.  Worked!

  3) The light that goes on with the turn signal is right behind the two
yellow arrows (center).  Also easy to pull out.  On mine, correct or not, it
always has a + feed and the negative is what is switched on / off.  This was
verified through volt meter and testing.  Bulb was OK and worked, but the
switched ground wire was missing.  I found every unconnected wire I could
and tried to find one that switched when blinkers were on but had no luck.
This wire appears to be entirely missing.  So I jumpered a new wire off the
flasher relay after a lot of study of the relay terminal behavior and got
one that did the job.  Connected it to the spade connector on the bulb
housing base and bingo, now I have a light bulb that flashes the speedo
arrows with the turn signals!

  4)  The right most fuse on the fuse holder controls:  a) wipers, b) horn,
c) dome light, d) ignition.  Well, the ignition isn't fused, but it DOES
connect off of the right fuse incoming feed.  Needless to say, corrosion or
shorts here are not a good thing.  I decided to replace the whole shebang,
just the #8 fuse, with a Buss ATC Fuse Panel.  I'm still troubleshooting and
correct major issues, stock isn't in the picture this winter.  For $12 local
FLAPS sells this 6-terminal fuse panel designed to work with the modern
blade fuses.  Made by Buss, part number BP/15600-06-20.  One incoming + feed
gives you 6 outgoing + feeds, each of which is inactive until you put a fuse
in.  Very well designed, a bit large (4 inches by 3 inches?), but very safe
and easy to work with.  Now all 4 devices, wipers + horn + dome light +
ignition are on their OWN fuse, not a shared fuse.

With good crimping skill and tool + a good assortment of wire and spade
connectors, I made patch connectors for all the existing wires going to the
right most fuse.  Home Depot sells some high quality spade connectors
designed for.  Wall Mart also sells these, but Home Depot sells them in
larger size packages at a better price (100 quantity is $6 female, $8 male).
I used 16 gauge stranded wire and the appropriate sized spade terminals
(ones with blue color plastic on the outside to cover the connectors/wires).
Made 6 inch wires with a male on one end and female on the other end.  This
allowed me to extend all the existing wires to the new fuse block.  Made
another jumper, male to ring terminal for the main incoming + feed (the Buss
fuse panel uses a screw/nut for the main + feed).

Unexpected Discoveries
======================

My wiper motor must be the original 6volt one!  I am able to run it off a 3
amp blade fuse and they now move back and forth at super high speed.   No
blown fuse, works great.  The previously corroded connectors must have been
the source of blown fuse and the slow speed.  As I replaced NOTHING more
than the fuse block, there was no voltage drop or otherwise.  As I don't
want to burn out the wiper motor -- I need to slow it own.   I'd rather work
out a voltage drop than to replace the wiper motor with 12v.  For my first
attempted, I ordered a rheostat to see if I can work out a way that allows
me to control the speed through variable voltage lowering...  I'll report
later how this works (Seattle weather gives me lots of chances to test).

Wall Mart and major chain FLAPS (Al's auto supply / Grant auto supply) carry
3 AMP as the smallest capacity ATC blade fuse.  An older local FLAPS had
them in 1 AMP and 2 AMP.  Always use the smallest that will do the job.  For
example, my dome light works fine with a 3 AMP.  The horn also works with a
3 AMP.  Wiper even runs on 3 AMP, that one still amazes me.  The 1 AMP and 2
AMP ones will be good for things like gauge lights, clock, and other such
things.  I could probably get my dome light to run on a 2 AMP, but 3 AMP (36
watts) is still pretty low (and safe).  Just don't use a 15AMP when all you
need is a 5 AMP!

The way the ignition taps off the UNFUSED feed of the rightmost fuse is not
my idea of a good design.  No wonder there are so many hot-start problems.
By using my BUSS fuse panel and a 15 AMP fuse, I've now fused that wire and
am seeing 1/2 higher volt as measured at the coil.  I also don't see as much
voltage drop when turn signals and brakes are applied.  Pulling the fuse
cuts the entire ignition circuit off (key does nothing), confirming that
this is indeed the correct circuit.  I'm happy that this is now fused.

P.S.  In previous projects I had cleaned up the terminals in the tail light
housing and other such stuff.  As soon as this crew saw Seattle moisture
there were problems here.  I need to re-do all these wires and spade
connectors, but I did get it working reliably by cleaning contacts and
grounding on housing.
