&gt;Anybody, esp. y'all across the Atlantic, have a URL for Creative
&gt;Engineering and Dave Palmer; I think those are the correct names.

&gt;And, anyone have any opinions on his safari windows?

&gt;Thanks,

or something like that. his site is on there i think.

also davesaf_at_aol_dot_com

sorry these are from memory but i'm sure they're about right.

opinions - hmm - bought a set of safaris from dave - when he first started
making them.... well chuffed!... well i would be they were new/
complete..instead of reparing rusty /half missing sets.
well made, - a bit of negligable tooling marks on the outer edge of 2 of the
frames - but hey, this was years ago. he's made a lot of sets since then.
nice new chromed sliders, stainless screws etc.

I think (here i go again &lt;g&gt;) he also makes rear safari windows, popouts,
westielike roof racks etc.

Glynn Seabridge   back on list after a few months err...off.
