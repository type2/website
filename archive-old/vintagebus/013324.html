More stuff about scoops, if you're tired of the subject move on!

The airflow environment near the air inlets is very hard to predict. 
My best guess is that the airflow is quite turbulant and that there is
a fairly thick stagnent air layer near the surface of the vehicle. 
The reasoning behind this is that the bus is a fairly blunt object and
that the airflow should detach (become turbulant) somewhere around the
region of the front doors.  This turbulent region is moving much more
slowly than the laminer flow layer outside of the turbulent region. 
You can test this yourself by hanging your hand out of the window and
feeling the airflow near the side of the bus versus further away from
the bus.

What does this mean?  Well, the turbulent layer is not the place to be
looking for good positive stagnation pressure to feed a cooling
system.  You would be much better off extending the scoops out a few
inches to place the inlet in the laminer flow region.  Check out the
inlets on race cars and aircraft to get the idea.

Another consideration is the Bernoulli effect.  A moving airstream has
a lower pressure than a stationary airstream, which means that the air
rushing past the inlet should have a lower pressure than the air
inside the engine bay.  Left to itself, air should flow _out_ of the
engine bay.  What a scoop _should_ do is to stop the air from moving
past the side of the bus in the area of the scoops, recovering the
pressure.

Inlet design isn't a trivial exercise.  Lots of effort goes into
designing an efficient inlet.  Lots of backyard engineers have
attempted to design inlets and quite a few have succeeded, usually
after several iterations of design and tests.  Slapping a scoop on the
side of a bus may or may not have the desired effect.

So, what does the above have to do with the _real_ world?  Not much
except to guide potential experimenters.  VW did a lot of work
designing an excellent cooling system into our vehicles.  The VW fan
moves a _lot_ of air, far more than could be moved by any scoop in the
slipstream.  It's a tough system to improve!  

I have never seen a stock VW in good condition overheat.  Overheating
is a result of some mechanical problem, from mishandling of cooling
air, or from pulling more power from the engine than it was designed
to produce.

Most applications of airscoops are in response to overheating caused
by a leaky engine compartment.  If you allow air to recirculate, then
some additional inlet pressure will help you out, but you'd be far
better off fixing the recirculation problem.

VW did go to a &quot;scoop&quot; style inlet on the baywindow buses, but if you
examine it carefully, you'll see that the plane of the inlet &quot;grille&quot;
is only about 20 degrees from that of the the side of the bus.  I
doubt that these inlets have any greater pressure recovery than the
louvers on the early buses.

George &quot;now where did I put those pressure sensors?&quot; Lyle
