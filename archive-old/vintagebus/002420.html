Hi all
I don't go back quite as far as Fred,
But in the 80's I was very active in  Class 5 score offroad racing,, I used
the Devcon Liquid aluminum putty in my cylinder heads to change the
combustion chamber shape and increase the compression ratio,,
I though the guy who suggested it was nuts,,,,, but it worked!

&gt;I don't have any experience with &quot;ALL METAL&quot;, but have plenty with a couple
&gt;of similar products.
&gt;
&gt;When I was building jigs and templates at Boeing back in the '50s, we did
&gt;revisions and repairs using DEVCON &quot;Liquid Steel&quot;.  This is a 2-part
product
&gt;with a very high metal content.  We'd plug holes in drill jigs with this
&gt;stuff, drill new holes in it after it cured, and press in steel drill
&gt;bushings.  The bushings stayed tight and true in production settings where
&gt;they were subjected to very high heat and torsional stresses.
&gt;
&gt;A similar product is &quot;MarineTex&quot;.  This is also a 2-part product that is
&gt;used often to repair outboard engine crankcases, etc., along with pump
&gt;casings, exhaust manifolds, etc.  It's extremely tough and can be machined.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW.....
