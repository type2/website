I have a friend with an original '64. The door seals are original and
are of the same profile as the ones from WCM. I can't be sure about the
material that they're made of but the profiles are bang on the money.
There are three different profiles on his doors. There's a square, a
&quot;bullnose&quot; with a groove down the middle and a square with the one
corner cut off.

The WCM glovebox catalog shows where they fit on or about page 109.
