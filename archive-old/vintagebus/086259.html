It looks like Cip1 also has 12V and 6V versions:

I still have the original 6V relay even though my bus was converted to
12V some time ago,  I think that's because the relay coil is only
energized when switching filaments.  My Bentley has a misprint in the
216 000 001 wiring diagram, indicating the fuel gauge as the dimmer
relay.  It also looks like the non-US versions would let you flash the
headlights without the light switch having to be on, and that the
dimmer relay is then called a flasher and dimmer relay.  But it is
separate from the 9-prong blinkgeber.

I like the green shrink tubing!
