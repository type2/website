Subject: Re: link pin zerk won't take grease

&gt;this can't be good, I haven't tried to remove the zerk and check to see
&gt;if its clogged.  Do the zerks clog?

As has been said, sometimes it's because you're trying to pump against
old hard nasty grease.  Sometimes zerks do get stuck, though.  You can
try to unstick yours, or you can get another one at the FLAPS.  If at
all possible, take the old zerk with you!  There are inch thread and
metric thread zerks and you need metric thread ones.

The Idiot manual suggests that if you have a fitting that won't take
grease, to take it to a shop and have them grease it with a power grease
gun.  I haven't tried this but it sounds plausible.
