Subject: re:Hasty engineering...

I know I shouldn't get involved in this...but against my better
judgement...the original parts are based on very old engineering
theories. Engineering changes at an amazing pace. I definitely would not
defend all of the aftermarket because there is some real junk out there.
There are also some really well thought out products that are based on
in depth current engineering. Electronic ignitions are one. Radial
tires, another. Improved shock technology. Just because it is new does
not inherently make it bad. I would be suspicous, but not write it off
as bad altogether. One of the best modern day engineering feats for the
VW bus is Rain X. Now where would us North Westerners be without that?
