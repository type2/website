Hey y'all
Are there any listees from West (by god) Virginia?  I'm moving up that way 
in a few months and need to know &lt;precisely&gt; how in depth they get with 
inspections.  What do they look for besides the basics of lights, horn etc.  
What are the rust rules?  How difficult do they make it for us bus folk?

Mad Uncle Dave

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
