Subject: RE: Saint Muir - Was he a &quot;HIPPY&quot;

My thought is--If ALL of us knew as much about the workings of VW as Muir did--There might
be a lot more VWs still on the road --with their motors still going strong--I know there
are some things that Muir said regarding our VWs -that may  not have been the very correct
proceedure--But his &quot;Idiot&quot; book --I know has saved many of us--And as TWWM, i kept a
copy, as bed side reading  --as well as a copy in the garage and in my VWs--Hippy or not
Muir came through for us in a language we could all understand--
&quot;Hippy&quot; means many things to many people --and with many meanings--I have never thought of
it as a derogatory term--But Any word or Phrase--said in a Sarcastic Tone--could be
derogatory --The main thing to remember is that we are ALL here because of our Love of
VW--That in itself transcends all boundries--it make us all Brothers and Sisters in the VW
Family--Peace--, TWWM, uj
