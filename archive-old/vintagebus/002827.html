&gt; I know I have made a few posts before concerning the twin towers event.
&gt; And I am trying not to post about it anymore. Yet, I heard a most
&gt; disturbing report today. Very disturbing. So disturbing that I think
&gt; everyone should be aware of this, not just listees. A reporter in
&gt; Pakistan was in one of the wacko religious schools there and all the
&gt; students were in a celebratory frenzy. And they announced that OUR
&gt; CHILDREN are next. That they are going to bring their JIHAD to our
&gt; SCHOOLS!
&gt;
&gt; Now if anyone doubted that these folks are RATBASTARDS before, they
&gt; should understand just what this country is facing. And while before I
&gt; had great concern to protect the innocent over there, I am less
&gt; concerned about that now: the innocent of this country are of greater
&gt; importance. I hope our military stikes these radical training schools
&gt; preemptively. One student held up a picture of the Sears tower in
&gt; Chicago and said &quot;this one is mine&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Scary stuff.
&gt;
&gt; Les
