Subject: 1967 VW bus for sale

Hi,
It's been awhile since I've looked at or posted to Vintage Bus list. I
was trying to get to the Buy &amp; Sell section, but my old browser
(Netscape 4) hangs up there. We purchased a '67 Kombi (bench seat) 4
years ago because my wife's first car was one just like it. Things have
changed (our kids are now 6, 7 &amp; 9 and she has a new career) and I'm
just not going to get to it. I liked this forum and all the interesting
discussion so maybe someone might be interested in it. We live in
Thousand Oaks, Calif. just north of LA. The bus is fairly original and
needs everything - paint,glass,upholstery,rebuild. I drove it home (on
the freeway at 50), but the engine is definitely worn out. It spent its'
entire life in Redondo Beach. The upholstery is shot. The nose has a lot
of rust along the bottom edge. The back end was hit. There is a little
rust along the bottom of the side door opening. The roof is great - no
dents and a little suface rust in the drip rail. The floor pan seems to
be in good shape. I have parts to rebuild the bumpers, a '66 front clip,
a spare complete original large nut transaxle, L &amp; R door window frames,
repro panel for behind the engine, 009 distributor w/Pertronix, sump oil
pan kit, spare drum, spare rim, rubber front floor mat. We're asking
$2000 for everything. I think there may be a couple of more parts
stashed around. I'm going thru all my stuff and trying to get organized.
If you know of anyone who might be interested I can get some photos and
email them out.
