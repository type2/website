Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad?

These are getting really funny to read.

'58 Panel Bus(for sale)
'60 European Beetle
'67 Deluxe Bus

&gt; FS:   1963 Westy SO33 .   Lots of rust, lots of missing parts, has been
abused by PO for many years.  The engine is complete with many new parts-
just not assembled or installed.  Rear wheel wells hacked out, front wheel
wells hacked out, dash hacked out. The remains of a front bumper are welded
to the frame, but I'll throw in a an extra bent &amp; rusty one.  The grey
primer finish looks great in pitch dark or from over 100' away.  Most of the
glass is fogged, all the seals are shot - except the ones that are missing.
New tires and battery :)  Runs great except for the lack of an engine,
decent brakes, loose steering -but man, these tires are nice!  The rims are
blasted and repainted so they are shiny too!
&gt; Own a real ROLLING piece of history today!
&gt; $13,900 OBO  - cash only   ( This way I can tell the wife I tried to sell
it :) )
&gt; Limited time offer, while supplies last.
