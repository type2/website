&lt;&lt; BTW, had you cleaned up the connections on the old starter, and where the 
 battery ground strap goes to the body?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
We agree with Clara.  90% of the time it seems these causes are what keep a 
good VW from starting.  Also bad ground cables, especially the ones that have 
the replacement repair battery clamp, clamped on the end of the old cable.  
We buy brass cable clamps from our Shucks store and solder these onto the 
original positive cables and just buy new braided style ground cables.
