Subject: Re: RGB Rebuild (Reduction Boxes)

From: &quot;Thomas J. Tarka&quot; &lt;tommy_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;

&gt;	a) it seems like I have to remove weld/drill&amp;screw-out the plug on
&gt;		the inner RGB half in order to remove it: is this the case
&gt;		or can i pull the RGB and disassemble on the bench?

The RGB housings and axle tubes are one piece (practically speaking).  You have to remove the side cover plate on the tranny, the outer axle 
bearing (thus RGB cover) and RGB mounting nuts to remove.  Good pix of the whole assembly on NQ's site - I forget the URL.  Bentley's description 
was excellent.

&gt;	b) sounds like i may or may not need a bearing puller: is there a 
&gt;		size I should shoot for in renting one, or...

I didn't need one, but it would help.  You want something to help get the outers off.  Inners are much easier.  

&gt;	c) along these lines, if I wanted to replace the RGB instead of 
&gt;		rebuilding, would I need the above tools, or will it just
&gt;		pop right off?

See a).  If you're *just* replacing the RGBs with housing, you'll need to find a way to press the axle tube off.  I'd look for the whole thing.

&gt;	d) are there other gotchas to be concerned about?

You'll want a good pair of circlip pliers.  To remove the plug, you can use the weld-a-nut method, or if no welder, I used a body slide hammer - 
screwed into the plug.  Left a hole that could be welded up, but I just bought new plugs.

Check the archives - as you mention, lots of good stuff from E&amp;B, also from Ronnie, Clara, and a buuunch of other folks who helped me a few months 
ago.
