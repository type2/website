Subject: Re: [VB] where does my spare go?

I remember my friend having a bus with BOTH a bench seat bulkhead with spare
tire well AND the wheel well in the rear to the left side.
Who's to say that busses didn't exist without spares? ;-)

&gt;

&gt;Only two places it could ever go.  
&gt;
&gt;If you have a walk through it goes in the spare wheel well on the left rear
&gt;area of the engine shelf (inside above the engine) just inside of the rear
&gt;hatch.
&gt;
&gt;On a bench seat model it goes behind the front 1/3rd 2/3rds
&gt;driver/passanger seat.  
&gt;
&gt;Thats it.
&gt;
&gt;Did someone make a walk through out of your bench seat???  That could
&gt;explain why there is no spare well.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; hey everyone-
&gt;&gt; on my 65 westy so-42, there seems to be no place ot put the spare tire!
&gt;there 
&gt;&gt; is no well above the engine compartment, nor behind the front bench seat,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; wich was never cut. there are bolts to mount it on the front of the busd,
&gt;but 
&gt;&gt; ive never heard of those coming from the factory or dealer installed.
&gt;anybody 
&gt;&gt; got any ideas???
&gt;&gt; also, does anybody know if westfalia ever did paint jobs?
