Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Tailgaters

&gt; I'd love to say &quot;activate smoke screen!&quot;, and produce a detering, but not
&gt; dangerous effect, don't need them too close AND blind.

I saw this thread and thought of my Quad-D &quot;Daily Driver Diesel Dasher&quot;. Once I
(finally) get it up to hiway speed and am tailgated, all I have to do is stomp
on the accelorator and watch the smoke (and smell) fly.

Somehow, I dont get tailgated that much or that long! =) Must apply to diesel
Vanagons too.

Side note: the Quad-D has been, and currently is, a Tri-D until fixed. Need to
stuff the new axles back into place...

In tech pubs terms you could say
CHANGE TEXT- WAS: &quot;Daily Driver&quot; IS: &quot;Dead&quot;
Repair by Remove and Install, replace with undamaged like item.
