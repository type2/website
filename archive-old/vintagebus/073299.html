Subject: gatorgrip=crap

Trying to get the springplate bolts off my '61...I bet
these bolts have never been turned in 42 years!

my socket rounded off the corners,and i'm getting
nowhere with the &quot;hammer and chisel&quot; method. A
co-worker suggested this gator-grip thing, which is a
socket with little spring-loaded rods inside that
surround your bolt/nut, and are supposed to be able to
grip anything. pshaw! It's total crap. I broke it in
about 2 seconds. Then I noticed right on the package
it says something like, &quot;100 foot pounds of wrenching
power!&quot; Heh, thanks. how about a thousand?

I'm hesitant to put a torch on it since it's right in
the redux box casing...

I guess if it comes down to it i'll have to grind the
head off, and drill it out. ugh.
