Subject: Ron in Europe 8/6-8/116 - Cropredy?

I'll be out of the office tomorrow thru the end of next week, so any email
sent to me (ron_at_busdepot_dot_com) probably will not be read until I return.
However, it's business as usual at the shop, and all email sent to the shop
(sales_at_busdepot_dot_com) will be answered as usual.

Incidentally, this trip is a mixture of business and pleasure, and we
(myself, my wife Evon, 4-year old Haley, and another couple with their 3
year old girl) will be camping at the Cropredy Festival, a music festival
hosted by Fairport Convention in Banbury, UK next weekend.  Do any UK
listmembers happen to be going?
