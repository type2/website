Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

--part1_12.14986d6c.290f20c7_boundary

       You need what is called a clam shell or bearing splitter.  It is 
basically two half circles that bolt together, these would bolt together 
underneath the steering wheel where your turn signal switch is (you gotta 
remove the switch).  When the two halves are bolted together, you can now use 
a two arm gear puller to pull the wheel off, plus if you feel the need to 
help things along with a hammer, your banging  on the bearing splitter and 
not the wheel.  I scored my bearing splitter at Harbor Freight.  It cost 
about $29 and has treaded holes in the bearing splitter halves.  Included in 
the kit is treaded bolts for the bearing splitter halves and the puller, plus 
a few other things like claws for the puller.  Well, worth the cost, this kit 
has pretty much covered most of my puller needs.
                                                               Peace,
