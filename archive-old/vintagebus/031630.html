I have had many inquires on the one wheel trailers at Pomona, so here's what
I know.

Danny Zapeda (aka Mr. Hannover and peopleparts) had 3 of them. 2 box styles
and 1 complete camper tent style, I didn't get the prices but he always has
adds on the PLANET.

Rob Cress from Colorado also had an Allstate trailer, looked to be late 60's
style, again I didn't get a price, but he also had adds on the PLANET.

Also, the boys from VTO always seem to come up with these and I saw a couple
at Rich Yost bus ranch in Cali. that he said were for sale.

I do not have contact numbers or e-mail for these fine folks so do some
hunting and you might end up with a trailer.
