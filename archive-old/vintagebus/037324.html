&lt;&lt; My problem is that i am having a hard time getting grease in the front 
 kingpin zerk (the one that holds the brake line mount) and the small 8mm 
 zerk on the link pin that points forward also. &gt;&gt;
Hi Domonic,
Did you have the front of the bus jacked up just to the point that the wheels 
are slightly off the ground?  This takes the pressure off the king pins to 
allow grease in and as an added plus allows one to quickly adjust the front 
brakes for maximum function and longevity.  Grease the joints until new 
grease comes out and thusly the old cruddy, dirty, watery grease is forced 
out at least every 3,000 mile if not sooner.   Eric&amp;Barb
