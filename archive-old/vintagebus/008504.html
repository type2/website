&gt; Addison has relocated yet. But I can give you his # 1-630-627-7228. I have
&gt; not been down there in some time.

I was out to Eldena where Jeff Spencer has bought the old grade school, and
I know that his move is taking longer than anticipated. I assume he still
has his business in Addison, the business card he left on my split still
lists the 630 area code phone number.
