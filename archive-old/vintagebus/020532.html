Hi all,

Well thanks to the infamous &quot;No Quarter&quot;, aka Erin Lassley of the
&quot;Buskatiers&quot;, our &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #17&quot; web site has an
updated page and links.  I'm not a computer literate guy, and last year
Erin graciously offered to make up an info page and host it on his web site
for those interested in learning more about the Labor Day event.  He even
linked to a map on Mapquest.  This year I got the domain names and Erin
again offered to assist!  He updated the info with this years correct data
and it is now up on our web sites.  If you like, you can check it out at:

http://www.BussesByTheArch_dot_com

-or-

http://www.BNNTA_dot_com

Thanks again Erin for your help and support!  If anyone out there has any
nice BBTA/BNNTA photos that they'd like to share with others on the sites,
send 'em along to me.  We'll be adding more pages with photos as time goes
on.  We hope to see you there!

Bill Bowman
NEATO/LiMBO

p.s.   Erin can be seen sitting on the door sill of his Bus in one of the
photos!
