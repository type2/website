most

general
&gt; attending public, or the promoters. We have not run into a case
wherein the
&gt; judging was held to the standards of a Concours de Elegance as in the
&gt; bigtime Ferrari/Cobra/Mustang/Mercedes/Porsche etc crowds.

I don't think that this is all that bad.  When the judging gets that
nit-picky the cost of restoring goes way up.  Folks who restore early
Fords (T's, I think) talk about having to replate certain bolts in
their drivetrain as the originals were heavy zinc plated, not cadmium!
 Of course, the correct head marked bolts aren't available in zinc, so
they have to have the cad chemically stripped off and zinc applied!

Do we really want this level of scrutiny on VWs?  I'd rather encourage
folks to keep their buses in good repair in order to drive them!
