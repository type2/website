Subject: Re: [VB] gas tank leak anyone?

Hi Coerver,
You definitely need to remove the engine to see what is going on there!!  As 
for repairing the tank, if one part of the tank has gone bad all the rest of 
the tank is suspect and could go at anytime.  Best to install a replacement 
tank.  We went with a 1968-71 bus tank which gives you 15 gallons instead of the 
pre-1968 10 gallon tank.  This requires a fuel proof large diameter hose to go 
between the later tank and the old tank neck you saw off the old tank.  We 
also found the old tank neck needs to be cut and rewelded to a differant angle 
to meet the fuel hose properly and pass through the body grommet properly.  
Check Thom's Vintagebus_dot_com website for his write up on installing the later tank.
