Subject: RE: [VB] Copper or steel brakelines?

Stainless steel.This is who I use in my area and they make park brake cables too.I am sure you can find a supplier in your area.

When I was into Minors and Mini's the spares companies offered both but the Copper lines were not DOT approved for street use.Copper is way too soft,vulnerable to chafing and work hardens quickly.

ubject: [VB] Copper or steel brakelines?


I am going to replace my brakelines as a few of the grommets are breaking
up, and as they are the original steel ones I think it would be safest to
replace them.
