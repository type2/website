Subject: Custom Diecast Buses for Natural Bus?

I'm going to do sets of Bus for Natural Bus this year like last.  They will be
a set of 21 Window and 1 Panel for $15.  If have enough request I'll do enough
of one or the other to sale singles.  They will sale for $8 ea for 21 Window
and $ for the Panel.  I also have JL Single Cabs I can do for $11 each or has
a set with the JL Bus for $22,  These Buses cost quite a bit to buy.  If you
want a set, one of a particular one let me know and I'll be sure to have one.
The Buses will be in White for the Base paint.  I will have a Special set for
the Give away, make that two special sets for the Giveaway.  One set I will
preview when it's ready and the other will only be seen there.

Drop me an email if you'd like me to hold a set for you.  I'll have plenty of
extras for the show.

Dave
