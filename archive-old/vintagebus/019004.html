&gt; I did not write that, No Quarter did.  And my name
&gt; is &quot;Stephen&quot;, not &quot;Steven&quot;
&gt; :!)
Stephen
------------------
**Steven** Martin used to say, &quot;Well EXCUUUUUUUSE me!&quot;

OK, Stephen- not SG, not Steve, not Stevie since first
grade, don't call me &quot;Goot&quot;, not Steff, Sta, St, S,
not unpronouncible sound that procedes detection while
forming the S sound with your mouth nor &quot;Steven&quot;, 
Whatever... OK, I'm over it. Good thing I didn't
attempt the last name, for gosh sakes ;-}

Thanks to you, NQ, Ronnie and the photographers at
large for allowing all us of who could not make the
trip &quot;virtually&quot; participating. I've enjoyed it.
Peace to all,
-Ellis\
