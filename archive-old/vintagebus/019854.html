well I got the flywheel off today, the flywheel holes had been ovaled out, and
the end of the holes in the end of the crankshaft ovaled out...recommendation
from the local vw guru - at least a new crankshaft and flywheel. I could fix
the existing ones, but it would weaken what i have, and to fix the crankshaft
you need to open the case, as long as I am opening the case I might as well
get a balanced cranksaft.  

he suggested i finish cracking the case, and then bring it all to him to go
over all the parts I will need.

first time engine rebuilder on the horizon...wish me luck!
