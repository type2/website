&lt;&lt; Does anyone have one of these (is it a set?) that they want to sell/offer?

Hi Jason,
The jack handle/lug wrench socket was part of the stock tool kit that would 
come with the VW from the factory.  Almost always the tool kit bag was made 
of the same material as the interior set material from about 1955 onward.  
Probably part of a waste not want not situation.
  What is the interior material type in your bus?  We have the tools and 
might have the proper tool bag for your VW.  Eric&amp;Barb
