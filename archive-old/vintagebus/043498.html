&gt;According to the diagrams, '72 up beetles and 70-71 busses seem to use
&gt;a 2 prong with ground flasher relay and the turn signal warning light
&gt;is hooked right to 49a.  Does this mean it acts just like the other
&gt;turn signal lamps and looses its failure notification function?

Probably.  Depending on the internals of the later flasher relay, its
flash rate may be substantially different if a lamp is burned out,
so that might serve as an outage notification.  Another note is that
the warning light is hooked between 15 and 49a and the exterior turn
signal bulbs are hooked between 49a and ground.  The warning light
probably grounds through the exterior lamps.  If one is burned out,
the warning light will probably be just a bit dimmer, if it doesn't
go out completely.

&gt;You may want to point out that by using an early baywindow emergency
&gt;flasher switch (71 for sure), one can eliminate 4 relays in your
&gt;solution.  Someone jump in here if I am wrong.  This switch functions:
&gt;OFF:  
&gt;15=+ (powers flashers through ignition only)
&gt;54=54f (brake light pass through)
&gt;
&gt;ON:
&gt;30=+ (powers flasher directly from battery)
&gt;49a=VL=VR=54f (flashes front lamps and rear lamps through brake circuit)

I looked at the '71 wiring diagram and this looks feasible.  The only
other change required for an early Bus would be to go to an aftermarket
turn signal flasher.  The stock ones were only rated for 2 lamps, and
using this switch appears to put a 4-lamp load on the flasher.

&gt;On another relay subject:  I have been looking at the 62-65 USA wiring.
&gt;This has 2 relays and the flashers work right off the battery (no
&gt;ignition only operation).

Actually, it has one flasher and one relay.  The turn signals do work
from the battery - I can turn on the signals anytime on my '64.

&gt;The brake light circuit is wired directly to the turn signal, and in
&gt;emergency mode the rear lights operate off a simple emergency switch 
&gt;in.  My question is:  Why did VW add a second relay (SPDT) to operate
&gt;the front lamps in emergency mode?  My hunch is that the main flasher
&gt;realy either had too low a capacity (like 2x21W) or had the failure
&gt;function of the turn signal warning light &quot;tuned&quot; to operate only
&gt;with two lamps. 

I think the relay was added to keep the extra load off the flasher...
original flashers I have seen are stamped &quot;2x18W&quot;.  Also, note that
the relay is more like an DPST relay with the two poles tied together
on one side.  When you pull out the hazard switch, the rear two
bulbs are connected to 49a, so they flash.  The coil of the hazard
light relay is also connected to 49a, so it switches off and on.
It is switching both front lights to circuit 30 so they come on and
off - but each front light has to have its own pin at the relay,
otherwise the left and right front turn signals would interfere with
each other during normal operation.

This design works pretty well - it only loses when you step on the
brake with the hazards on.  In this condition, both rear lights come
on solid.  That's not so bad, but unless there are some diodes in
the hazard light switch, it will also make both front lights come on
solid.  The later (9-prong box) design essentially disables your
brake lights when the hazards are on - I'm not sure this is the best
idea from a safety standpoint.
