Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky carb

I had a similar problem. What I did was buy a carb rebuild kit ($10) 
and replaced every seal, gasket and also the needle valve (comes with 
the kit). The leak is gone. It was a fairly easy fix (once I figured 
the problem out).

-Rocky

&gt;Tonight when I got home I pulled the bus into the
&gt;driveway and then came in to let the dog out. I came
&gt;back out to the bus to install a new preheat hose.
&gt;When I opened the deck lid there was some gas dripping
&gt;from the carb onto the case. This alarms me. I dont
&gt;see it leak anymore, I install preheat hose then start
&gt;bus and watch for leak. I don't see it leak anymore. I
&gt;am going to switch the carb, but can anyone tell me
&gt;where my 28 pict might be leaking from, or why?
