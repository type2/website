What vendors out there sell
kits that are resonable and can I just used a later 68/69 bay front end?
Hi Eric,
Try Wolfgang International for the kit.  You can use a 1968/69 front beam and 
use 1971-79 discs.  Problem with the later beam is it raises the front about 
1-1/2&quot; higher.  So you either have to raise the rear or get lowered spindles 
or weld in drop adjust sections into the front beam.  We are not sure discs are 
really needed.  The only improvement we have heard is they are supposed to 
keep cooler than drums.  Have only overheated the brakes once when we were still 
using 1955-63 suspension/brakes and only due to Barb not downshifting and 
dragging the brakes too much.
  Plus with disc brakes you will absolutely need to install a &quot;Rear Brake 
Pressure Regulator&quot; (see VW &quot;Official Service Manual&quot; for 1968-79 bus, section 8, 
pages 11-13 to prevent the rear brakes from locking first.
