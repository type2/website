Hi Robert,
Probably the best way to figure out which type of bus you want is to go out 
to VW meets and study the buses that show up.  Check vintagebus_dot_com for the 
events in your area.  Most owners will be happy to show you thier bus/es!  
Yes, having more than one bus is often very helpfull.  We have found that 
having at least a single cab and a camper is a must for us.
