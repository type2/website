FWIW.....

Back in the early '80s, when Mt. St. Helens turned Washington and the
Northwest into an incredible dustbowl/sandblast box, the airborne dust
and grit was killing engines in minutes.  No typo or hyperbole, &quot;minutes&quot;
is correct.  Emergency vehicles especially, like State Patrol cars, aid
cars, etc., would motor into a thick cloud of the airborne ash and have
their engines seize within a few hundred yards.

Various oil companies and government agencies quickly distributed
pamphlets with suggestions for dealing with the dust and ash, which was a
continuing problem for many months after the eruptions ceased.  All sorts
of creative and bizarre air filtration strategies were put forth, but the
one that really seemed to work was pantyhose.

In areas with moderate amounts of the extremely abrasive ash a set of
pantyhose, folded many times and secured over the air cleaner intake with
rubber bands, duct tape, wire, etc. gave excellent protection.  Many
drivers got into the routine of removing the &quot;pantyhose prefilter&quot; at
each stop and replacing it with a fresh setup.  At minimum they carefully
shook out the accumulated ash and reinstalled the pantyhose with the
clean side inside.

Where the ash was a major problem and still so thick that visibility was
difficult the routine was to stuff 
the air cleaner's intake snorkel with pantyhose, then add the external
&quot;pantyhose prefilter&quot;.  This arrangement had to be cleaned and replaced
frequently, often in just a few miles, but was remarkably effective in
excluding the dust and grit.  It also had a choke effect, drastically
increasing fuel consumption and reducing performance, but was still the
best of a range of bad versus not so bad choices.

There are many vehicles that survived the dust and ash clouds using these
strategies that are still running today without having had any major
engine work.
