Subject: wiring 

Thanks to everyone for the wiring suggestions.  I think I'll pull the 
harness out of the bus and fix it back to spec.  When I put it back into the 
bus, I think I'll also run a bundle of trailer wire from front to back as 
well for future use with gauges, smoke screen devices, etc.  I'm sure I'll 
be asking more questions as I get into it.
