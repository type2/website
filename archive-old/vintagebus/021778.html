uh, sorta...  I have been working with this bodyshop restoring a few VW's and 
they have offered to help me paint mine, and it needs it.  8-)  Started 
stripping the nose today and one of the colors I found was Dark green.  I'm 
trying to trace the PO history of mine back as far as I can (I found an 
Australian penny in it while cleaning it - !!??)  To date the history goes:  
Me &gt; Jon Jones &gt; Jeff Keller&gt; some guy in Northern CA&gt;????.  Anyone remember 
seeing a Green Binz 10 -20 years ago?  

As always, I would appreciate any info on ANY Binz, Binz owner, or PO.

Thanks,
Dan
