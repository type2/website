I need to start learning more about my  '67 Camper. I want to start
restoring the interior and thinking about a paint job, but I know nothing
about my Camper. I only learned recently that it was a 12volt and that's
only because of the Bus List. I have a few technical manuals but they don't
really discuss VW models and styles. I don't have the time to go to VW meets
becuase I'm always gone on weekends to horse shows.

what are you wanting to know?    The Idiot Book by Muir is excellent re 
maintaining an old VW for the non experienced as it is written to be 
understood by non mechanics.   I learned a lot from it, and from friends, all 
of which gave good advice and also sometimes poor advice and misdirection.    
 I learned about bodywork and paint hands on from people.  takes a lot of 
time, or maybe I am just slow.   Interiors?   I think I learned some wood 
working basics from my Dad and enjoyed making new panels for the inside of my 
camper.   I haven't seen any book discussing models and styles in a way that 
I was impressed with, but there are book with nice shiny pictures of various 
buses, if you wated that sort of thing.   I wonder if there is a nice book 
out there aboout westys , with pictures of diferent camper kits and style 
change over the years so-32, so 42 etc etc- there was a camp box news -  
westy nut newsletter for a while but I think it is defunct
