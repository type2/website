&gt; ...I forgot to mention that the battery fell out in transit so I could
&gt; have lost some wires as well. Is there supposed to be a wire from the
&gt; positive terminal of the battery directly to the Voltage regulator? Or
&gt; does this connection happen through the battery/ solenoid connection?
