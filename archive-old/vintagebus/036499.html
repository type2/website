Subject: 64 sundial camper/TOO NICE TO BUTCHER
To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Alright....dragged the monster home tonight.
Overall a decent bus.
Nothing on its great enough to want to steal, and nothings ugly enough to 
verify the molestation.
Heres the skinny:

Late 64 bench seat sundial camper
NO MOTOR.
No rims or tires, and no rear bumper blade, brackets, or splashpans (had 
uprights and overriders).
Cut wheel wells front and rear (not too bad).
Otherwise pretty much complete.
Complete inteiror.
Battery tray crusty.
Front floors decent.
Nice rockers, nice roof, dry doglegs, nice front skin, nice cargo doors.
I'll have photos available tomorrow A.M.
THIS BUS DESERVES TO BE SAVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll give it till next weekend (SOTO meet and pomona SUNDAY).
After that I break out the sawzall.
800$ flexible.....more flexible before SOTO, and EXTREEEEEEMLEY flexible 
after pomona.
Thanks-
Greg
