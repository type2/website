Subject: Re: [VB] Towing my 67

Fill it with fluid, fill it with fluid, fill it with fluid.  That would be
like turning over a motor with no oil in it.  It may not seize immediately,
but it will seize if you turn it over long enough.

67 Deluxe Bus


&gt; Hi all,
&gt; My 67 bus needs to be towed to her new home. I had removed, a
&gt; long time ago, the left rear backing plate, brakes and rear reduction
&gt; box cover. As in the cover and seal. I have replaced the cover, put
&gt; the gasket on and need to tighten it up. It appears that most, if not
&gt; all, of the oil for the box leaked out. Now, if I am towing the bus,
&gt; front wheels up, rear down, for about 8 miles, max speed about 50
&gt; mph, should I worry about refilling the box to ensure nothing seizes?
&gt; Or is it safe to tow this short distance and speed. Engine is out.
