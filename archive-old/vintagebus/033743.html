The bus was a roach, I have cut up buses in better condition then that. It
WASN'T rare, just some aftermarket hack. BBT has one of the most extensive
collections of VW's on the planet and if he thought the bus was savable he
would have and has the facilities to do it. Look at BBT web site and see
some of his collection, Heck he only wanted 500 dollars for it and it was
for sale a long time. There is a bus in Australia that someone should buy
fast before it gets cut-up or just junked, it's a beastlewagen (sp), the
only split one I have ever seen belongs to C H. The one in Aussie land is
for sale for $2000 dollars and has all parts to complete, just the skin on
the box is gone, but the frame work looks to be restored already. If anyone
is interested in this bus I can send you the owners name and phone and you
can get in touch with him. I was told it would cost between $1500.00 to
$2000.00 to get shipped to the U S.

Ronnie, save whats savable and cut up the rest to save others.

That's really a pity shame.  These are such rare beasts.  Were they asking
too much for it?  Is this one of those, &quot;If I can't get what I want, I'll
show those mutha's and cut it up!!!&quot;  I can't help but think that the person
that did this is into VWs entirely for the wrong reason.
