Subject: Re: [VB] Cheap Jalousie window seal!

I heard caulk holds the moisture, true or false? But it seems that when you 
find a bus in a junkyard, and it does have some caulk on the windows, its 
surrounded by rust.

&lt;&lt; This is the cheap way to keep those darn Jalousie window seals from 
leaking!  Vintage Nazis please skip ;)
 
 I went to Home Depot and picked up a tube of GE Silicon II white caulk to 
seal the edges of my leaky died up seal Jalousie windows.  The GE caulk has a 
lifetime guarantee and claims NO SHRINKAGE or yellowing.  
 
 I slapped it into the caulk gun and went to work.  It is straight forward, 
just hit the outside edges and leave room in the bottom for a moisture drain. 
 Use your finger to smooth it out and squish in all the seams.  Be sure to 
use a rag to clean the edges and your fingers.  The caulk seemed of very high 
quality and adhered very well. 
 
 Should provide a leak free camping environment for many years of enjoyment.
 
 Take Care,
