&gt;Does anyone have experience to enlighten me?

As has been suggested, check the generator light.  I'm pretty sure that
the generators in VWs need this light present and working in order to
charge, and the alternators may need it too.  It should definitely go
on when you turn the ignition on but don't start the engine.

A fully-charged 12 V automotive battery with no load should read 12.6 V
at its terminals.  When you start the engine and rev it up to 2000 rpm
or so, the voltage at the battery should go up at least a volt to 13.6 V
or so if the charging system is working.

If you haven't done it lately, it would be a good time to take the
battery out of the Bus, check the electrolyte level, and put it on
the charger.  Take the other two ends of the battery cables off their
connections and shine them up.  Also, clean up the connections at the
alternator and the regulator (if it has a separate regulator).  When
the battery is charged, shine up the terminal posts and hook everything
back up.  Then, check out your generator light and repair as required.

&gt;Could the drain from the stereo suck the battery, from one stop to
&gt;another?

With a sane stereo (i.e. the cargo area is not full of 18&quot; woofers) and
a working charging system, no.  If the charging system wasn't working,
then it would be easy - the battery would start out not fully charged
and would be supplying the stereo, coil, lights, etc all by itself -- it
could easily discharge to the point where it couldn't run the starter
the next time.
