Hey NQ,

I too have enjoyed your updates and will need a new spectator sport if you
give in now. The pace at which you were getting stuff done made my three
months of double cab reanimation look downright sleepy.

During those months of living hell I came close to setting fire to the thing
a couple of times. I also came close to losing any meaningful contact with
my girlfriend and making a mortal enemy of my bank manager. 

I hated every second of the work cos it looked like it had no end and I
resented every extra unplanned expense(including a new longblock cos I
didn't have the time to have the machining done on mine) that pushed my
budget beyond its limits.

It was however all worth it. I now have a shiny happy bus that I take
pleasure in driving every day. I also don't have to sit in the traffic in an
econobox clone like most others.

If it is at all possible hang in there. The work that you've already done
has been done by YOU and not some mysterious PO. That is worth a lot in
itself. If you haven't already, develop a taste for good single malt it
seemed to help me!

later

Michael
