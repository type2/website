Try switching to a mix of moly grease and STP, about 1 part grease to 3
parts STP.  Mix it up really well, then use a pump oilcan to pump it in
there.  Replace the bottom seal first, which will also drain out the old
fluid.

Synth oil is too &quot;thin&quot; for this application - leaks too easily.
