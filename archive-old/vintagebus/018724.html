I'd like to take this opportunity to advertise the vintagebus registry.
Quite a few holes in the export and mcode knowlege base have been
filled in by entries in the registry; just last week I filled in 2 more
export codes, one for Chile and one for South Africa (thanks Fig)

&gt; My 65 DC has a 733 code. I still have no idea what its for. The truck is no
&gt; special model or anything. Just a plain US delivered double cab. It seems
&gt; there is a hole in the top end of the known M-codes.
