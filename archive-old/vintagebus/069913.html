----- Original Message -----
&gt; don't you mean pressure in the engine compartment?  The way I understand
it
&gt; the air flow into the engine compartment pressurises it, and with better
&gt; seals around the engine there is more pressure and so more airflow through
&gt; the fan/cooling sytsem.   I noticed more heat flow when I fully sealed my
&gt; engine compartment, which goes with the idea of pressurising it.


The upper engine compartment would be under vacuum, due to the fan sucking
in all that wonderful cool air. The more vents, or, ways for air to get into
the engine bay, the less vacuum you would have, the less vents, or, less
ways for air to get into the engine bay, the more vacuum you will have.
