It isn't too often that I get to make posts on this site, so I wanted to 
hurry and post this. Yesterday I saw that movie &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot;    The one 
eith Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.............wow......................OK 
sorry, I'm back now. Anyway, without giving a description of the scene, a 
very clean red and white deluxe drives by. It is not a quick glimpse though, 
it is driving, stops, people get in, and then there is a scene that takes 
place in the bus. I was pretty pissed I did not get much detail though 
because my date (Idid you think I would see a chick flick alone?) kept 
tugging on me shirt asking &quot;are those those things you like?&quot; So check it if  
you see that movie.
