Are you getting a spark from the coil itself?  Do the spark test, but
with the wire from the coil to the distributor.  That'll tell us which
half of the system the problem's in.  A) If there's spark, it's the
distributor cap, rotor, or possibly the wire from the coil.  B) If
there's no spark, it's a bad coil, bad or incorrectly-set points,
possibly a bad condensor, or no power.

case A:

Make sure that the rotor is at the right height for the distributor
cap.  Different caps require different rotors, and you only mentioned
replacing the cap.  If the rotor's not making contact inside the cap,
nothing will happen.

Use an ohmmeter to make sure the coil/distributor spark wire is good.

case B:

With the key on, make sure that you have +12 on one side of the coil
(where the wires from the choke and cut-off valve connect).

Hook up a test light like you were going to static-time the engine.
Go through the motions of timing, and see if the light ever cycles
between on and off and back again.  If it doesn't, then the points
have probably mis-adjusted themselves.  I'd consider this the most-
likely cause.

If the points seem to be working ok (might as well make sure the
timing's relatively sane while you're there), I'd suspect the coil's
shot.  Disconnect all the wires (marking them so you can put them back
correctly), and use the ohmmeter to check the resistance between the
strap holding the coil in place and the contact that the spark wire
comes out of.  It shouldn't be zero, and it shouldn't be infinite.
Not sure of the exact value, but I'd expect it to be in the few
thousand ohms range.
