&gt; Your '62, if stock should have the small axle nut, 1/2 ton rated rear end.
&gt; The next generation rear end incorporated the large axle/nut 1 ton rated

&gt; Well?  What do you have.

hello,

i heard that the 63 rear end was one year only.  I thought what i heard
was that it was small nut, but the stub axle the drum sits on is slightly
longer than normal, and the brake drum has a longer splined area to
compensate.

I have a 61, but i have access to a 63 for spares, and i wanted to make
sure that buying the 63 tranny would yield useable spares for my 61.

I will check the part numbers on the brake drums to see if they are the
same or different, that will tell for sure! (but that necessitates buying
the 63 tranny and disassembling it!)

take care,

Steve
