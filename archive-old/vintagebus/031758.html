Check the spline on those, I have had them here where the splines are pulled
off set. DO NOT use an impact gun on those, they will pull threads. Be sure
to check fot tru, they can be way out.

I have been meaning to do the 30 pict one top change, but haven't had time,
if the port is there for the choke pull-off they should work, will get to it
sometime.

I have a few of the early, (post and no post points) vacumm dizzys here.
Just went through a few of them to find a couple good ones for a customer
back east.

sent these to a vendor, but thought i'd kick 'em to the entire list for
fun......


My neighbor brought over some brake drums for his bus... they are Mexican,
and are BLUE! Has anyone seen these/tried these/sold these? Any quality
issues?


On those 'repro' 30-pict-1 carbs( NOT the 30/31), they are non-choke
models, BUT is there ANY reason why I couldn't just slap on the electric
choke TOP from my current 30Pict1 carb?


oh yeah, anyone have a vacuum advance dizzy, new or rebuilt? something
along the lines of the 205?
