Subject: Re: Bus on the highway

Eric&amp;Barb,
Thanks for the tip, and for ALL those hundreds of others you've posted 
which we and our busses have benefitted from.
3000RPM, or even a bit lower....Hmmm.
Does seem to coincide with or even be a bit faster than what &quot;feels&quot; 
like the best cruising speed for the bus.
Now, your post begs the questions:

1. Is the correct oil pressure for a 1500 the same as for the smaller 
engines (i've only got access to the '61 Without Guesswork)?

2. Where do i want to be measuring my oil temp &amp; pressure?

TIA,
Andres
