&gt; Only 2 busses?  How do you do it?  I seem to always have three or more

&gt; friends around.
well,

Ideal is 3 vehicles any more than that and i give the insurance companies
too much money... 2 vehicles is better and one is impractical given my
mechanicking skills ;)

take care,

Steve

p.s. i wish i could get liability only on me instead of my cars, but they
wont let me do that :-(  Since i can only drive one car at once, it makes
sense to me... but i digress.
