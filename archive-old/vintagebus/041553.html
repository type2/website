&gt; gas that came out of it :-)  Then I went to Pat Flynn's '71 carcass... it

&gt; to the '67 to install temporarily (I would love to have this bus roadable
&gt; by everybus).  I would love to be proved wrong, but I could *not* get that
&gt; tank in.  The distance from the top of the trans hump to the bottom of the
&gt; crossbeam under the rear deck is 1/2&quot; shy of clearing the tank.  Is it


the trick ehre, steve, is to .push.  it'll bend the lower deck down a bit
to squeeze it, but once it is in, everything sits right again.  it has to
squeeze the nipple (that you took off, i hope..) and the top hump into the
space that the upper reinforcement bar wants to occupy..

Even ol' hoover said you haveta force it in there.;)

maybe you can chase downt he post i made (i think..;) about installing the
onein my 66..

later...d
