Well I spent the better part of the afternoon trying ideas from the list.
 I replaced the oil sender swicth, the pressure relief valve, new oil
filter, new oil screen, 30 wt,  and put on the manifold and muffler thats
been in the garage for months.  It ran great , drove it for one hour on
the freeway, and up to Mount Helix Cross twice.  No oil light!  The new
manifold took care of the backfireing problem I was having also. Set
timing to 7and a half deg BTDC.  Comp reads 150 in each cyl.  Jason
scared the crap out of me with visions of another rebuild.  Although I
actually look forward to the next rebuild.   Thanks again
everybody.......Jon in La Mesa.     PS  saw a 21 window at the Downtown
La Mesa car show today is this a sv2 member?
