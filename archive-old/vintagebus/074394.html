&gt; I looked closely at the tranny and the VW number on the bell housing 
&gt; started with &quot;411&quot;

Hi John,
That is a type 4 tranny that was used also in 1972-79 buses with the type 4 
engine.  Will not fit earlier buses without massive redesigning and under body 
work.

&gt; Anyone know anything about a tranny like this? Is it something other than 
&gt; bus? Maybe Type 3 or late bus??

If it was for type 3 the tranny would start with a 311 part number.  If it 
was a 111 or 113 it would be for a type 1.  If it was a 211 guess what it would 
fit in!
