Hello everyone.  I have a dilemma.  I am trying to find a booster seat for
my rapidly growing spawn.  My son is 35lbs now and is getting to be too
tall for his car seat.  I have been posting to parenting boards for ideas,
and have acquired a bounty of useless nagging.  When I explained why I
couldn't install shoulder belts, one woman suggested, &quot;Might you consider
buying a new car?&quot;  My response was, &quot;My bus IS my new car.&quot;  The fallout
has been daunting.  Silly me, asking advice from people who simply cannot
understand.

What do parents here do for child safety?  Brand names and model names of
booster seats would be helpful.  I need something that will work for a 2
year old child over 40lbs and exclusively with lapbelts.  (He'll probably
be 3 by the time we need to use the new seat.)  My bus is a 66 split
walk-thru.  I do have some belts to install for use with the Z-bed, and
will gladly drill those holes.

Thank you so much!
Shannon
