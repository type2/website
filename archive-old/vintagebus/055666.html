Subject: Re: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

A lawsuit seems a little strong.  After all, condition is a judgement call.
Good condition, or needs work, or Rust in rockers means different things to
different people.  It seems that a few, or many, questions before the purchase
could solve a lot of trouble down the road.

In terms of the legality, unless you get with the bus that you purchase some
sort of guarantee, or the overall condition in writing, what would your grounds
for legal action really be?  I think that a used car is sold without warranty
unless you get something in writing.  Just my opinion, and I'm certainly no
attorney.

&gt; &gt; Someone asked me recently what their options were if they buy a Bus
&gt; &gt; cross-country and upon delivery, they find it was woefully misrepresented.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Should they file a personal lawsuit?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Could they???
