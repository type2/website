&gt; Well, since these are definately 1/3 2/3 seats comin out of this donaor
bus,
&gt; i'll assume they came from a later model.  Anyway, i'll ask this then..
Are
&gt; all 1/3 2/3 seats the same?

68 and up bay non-walkthru 1/3 2/3 seats are different than split. The 2/3
bay seat pivots in the middle to get to the spare. The 2/3 spilt seat is a
solid frame and the whole seat pivots up from the front hooks.
