Subject: Blue Rubber Mats

As one who is restoring a '66 Sea Blue/Cumulus White 21W Deluxe I can
attest to the difficulty in finding interior panels and the Blue mats.
If anyone out there has any panel with the Aero Papyrus White trim in
excellent shape I would be grateful for first opportunity, Ditto for the
blue-YES BLUE- rubber floor mats though the front one needs to be RHD to
be of any use to me! I have a reasonable collection of NOS bits
(including a NOS treasure chest door for a single cab) I would be
willing to trade otherwise cash.
