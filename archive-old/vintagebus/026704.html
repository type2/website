Subject: re: Registry clears 1000 bus mark!

Since most of the splitty owners I know don't own barndoors, these
numbers mean that there are a lot of splitty owners out there that
haven't yet found this list. 

I'm very interested in reading fix-it procedures necessary to keep these
beasties on the road as daily drivers, and stories about the travails of
owning, working on and driving them. Exact, proper restoration would be
nice, but is not within my budget...
