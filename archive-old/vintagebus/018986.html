&gt; The clue to this Mystery Message that NQ posted on Thursday:
&gt; 
&gt; He is reported to have been seen somewhere near sand and water.
&gt; 
&gt; I am working to get some photos in, but not sure if they will arrive.  Could
&gt; be another &quot;Bigfoot&quot; report, as I've heard that NQ is a pretty big guy.
&gt; Maybe the photos will be of Bigfoot himself?
