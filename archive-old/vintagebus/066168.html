Subject: Re: [VB] Re: polisihing trim

If you have some small &quot;dings&quot; in the trim work have you been able to work 
those out? And how?  Eastwood has some interesting items using a small 
hammer with a soft sand back pillow that looked to have some potential... 
Anyone?

&gt;I have found that #4 steel wool and Semichrome or Wenol, polishes the trim
&gt;very well--I have done it right on the bus with excellant results--
