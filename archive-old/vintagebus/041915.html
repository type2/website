&gt; The two biggest drawbacks are it took 12 bags of soda at $35 each to blast

&gt; ordinary vinegar, but it has to be found and removed.

Nooooo!  Vinegar is acetic acid and will tend to corrode things.  It's
hard to get things exactly neutralized, so you're better off with
mechanical methods and the air hose to remove the soda residue.
