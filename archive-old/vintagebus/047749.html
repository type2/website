Subject: rmmw billing
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

just a warning to those who deal with rocky mountain motor works, especially 
by credit card.  Check charges closely. I've haven't ordered a thing from 
them except a free catalog, and I'm getting notices for bills 61+ days over 
due.  When I called them when the first bill arrived a couple of months ago, 
they where very polite and explained that that has been happening quite a bit 
lately. when she pulled up the account # it belonged to some one in another 
state who oddly enough owed no money to rmmw either. Strangely even though 
they admit I owe no money over the phone, they just cant seem to stop billing 
me. If they had my credit card #  I would just be out the amount they claim I 
owe, since I dont make a habit out of reading statements and such.
