Hello Bus Listees!
	This is my first post. I am writing because I have had a lingering problem
with my Bus. While driving it often &quot;cuts out&quot; as if it is not getting fuel.
This causes it surge back. I have a 1600cc engine with kadron dual carbs. It
got really bad and so I did a tune up and replaced the distributor, points,
fuel filter, and did a valve adjustment. It seemed to go away for a while
after that but it has started doing it again. It is not as bad as it was
before though. It seems to be worse when I am going uphill. I haven't tried
to adjust the carbs yet.........I don't know how. I am not sure what else
could cause it though. Any Ideas?
