&gt;I would like some input on this subject, I've kicked this around and it
&gt;seems doable, but would like some &quot;expert&quot; opinions.

I don't know if I qualify, but I'll give it a shot...

&gt;These new small units are pretty efficient and inexpensive.  I was looking
&gt;at Sam's the other day and they have 12,000 BTU units that pull only 1,280
&gt;watts no kidding and for only $240.

1280 watts is 10.7 amps at 120 V or 107 amps at 12 V.  That's a lot of amps
for a 12 V system.

&gt;To power the ac unit, I was thinking of this:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.donrowe_dot_com/inverters/aims_2500.html

Their tech info seems to say that this modified sine wave (cheap)
inverter will work with an A/C, but I have some doubts.  Their usage
chart at http://www.donrowe_dot_com/inverters/usage_chart.html claims that
starting wattage for an A/C is 2.2 to 3.3 times the running wattage.
This means you need around 2800 to 4200 watts to start your A/C,
which the above inverter &quot;should&quot; handle.  Also, the inverter is at
best 90% efficient, which means for 1280 watts out, you'll need
1420 watts in, or 119 amps at 12 V.

&gt;I'm sure an extra alternator will need to be added to the engine (like in
&gt;the ambulance) and an extra battery as well for peak draw.

I know there are some GM and F-rd alternators that should produce the
required 120+ A output.  They will take at least 2 HP from the engine
to do so.  Whether they can do that on a continuous basis is an open
question - they'll be running flat out all the time just to keep the
A/C going.   As for the battery, you may need more than one.
http://www.ibsa_dot_com/www_2001/content/products/product_marine.asp
says that an Interstate SRM-29 deep cycle battery is rated at 3.4
hours for a 25 amp load.  This implies that the best you'll do is about
0.71 hours (42 minutes) for a 120 amp load.  You'll actuallly get less
than this, because batteries aren't linear.  This battery weighs 61
pounds.  If you don't mind 119 pounds of battery, you can get a
SRM-4D that will give 100 amps for around 1.4 hours (1hr 20min).

&gt;What do you think?

Your goal, here, is to spin the shaft of an A/C compressor.  Doing
that with electricity is going to take a couple of pounds of mounting
bracket and V-belt, 20 pounds of alternator, 60 pounds of battery,
14 pounds of inverter, plus wiring, that you have to haul around all
the time.  Doing that with a V-belt from the engine is a couple of
pounds of mounting bracket and V-belt.  There's a reason all those
Ch-vys and H-nd-s running around use belt driven compressors... :)
