My hat off to SV2'S for putting on a fantastic show and swap, great people,
great food, great vehicles and best of all the LOCATION, could this be the
Kelly Park of the Southern Cal. region? This is a must do show and will
always be on my agenda for a nice laid back show in an absolutely beautiful
setting.

JP from New Mexico hooked up with me in Havasu and off we went Friday at 1
PM., 110 heat and horrific humidity, but that didn't stop us, we cruised at
60 to 68 MPH, going 70 for short stretches, no heating problems, JP got hot
a couple of times, so we slowed 5 mph for a couple of miles then picked up
to speed again, great person to cruise with as he's not afraid to drive his
59 Westy with a 1600 at speed and JP is one of the most traveled bus people
I know, 1000's of miles all the time.

After Familianfest JP and I parted ways, he had family stuff in L.A. and I
was off to Pomona, Pomona is or has been a bomb the last few, great for
buyers though as there are a lot of open swap spaces. Best thing that
happened was I bought a set of OG Safaris from Greg Noble, after JP talked
about leaving his cracked open a little in the heat and letting the breeze
come in, I was sold, so hope to have installed by Jerome in the DD (metal
wiz, got any nut plates).

The cruise home was uneventful, did 300 miles in 4 1/2 hours, which put my
average speed a little over 60, gota love the 15 gallon bay tank, filled up
in somewhere by Pomona and made it home on a tank, around 275 miles.

I'm tired, 2 shows in 2 days wears you out, along with the 700 plus miles I
drove.
