Subject: Re: Visibility

actually I've got a walk-thru, but maybe I'll check into the 914 seat. 
 or plan on getting shorter with age...
Yeah I can't imagine putting that sun visor down.  I'd be completely 
blind!

&gt;Chris,
&gt;  Bet you have a bench seat! I'm 6'2&quot; also. Walkthroughs 
&gt;are better for tall drivers. I had to put in a 914 seat 
&gt;to prevent back and shoulder hunching, not to mention 
&gt;traffic collisions.  I still haven't put in the sun 
&gt;visors because they're never needed.

&gt;&gt;I've started driving my '65 every day and wondering:  anybody else have 
&gt;&gt;trouble seeing through the front window?  I'm 6'2&quot; and my eye level is 
&gt;&gt;even with the top of the window unless i bend myself into a question 
&gt;&gt;mark.  Hard to see the signal change....
