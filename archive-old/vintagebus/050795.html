Subject: Re: [VB] Preheat pipe

Are you in southern California?  I got mine for my '67 at Interstate VW
when they were still in Escondido--the straight tube that attaches to
the #4 cylinder exhaust stud.  They had 3 or 4 used ones on hand.  Try
checking out their website at http://www.interstatevw_dot_com/parts.html and
you can see if they have any left.

&gt;  I'm looking for one or more of the odd looking pre heat tubes with
&gt; the bracket attached.  They were original equipment on all later splits,
&gt; but
&gt; most have been long discarded.  Here are some not too good pics of what I'm
&gt; 
&gt; looking for.  It attaches to the bottom exhaust stud on the #4 cyl.  It is
&gt; a
&gt; tube about 1 inch in diameter and cut at a 90 degree angle on one end and
&gt; the other end is cut at about a 45 or so.  The tube itself is bent at a
&gt; right angle and has a small bracket welded to it.  The flex tube that comes
&gt; 
&gt; off of the air cleaner goes through the rear horizontal tin next to the
&gt; crank pully and attatches to the part in question on a plane along the axis
&gt; 
&gt; of the bus itself....confused?? I'm sure Clara's not ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; If I find a better picture I'll post it, or maybe someone else out there
&gt; has
&gt; a link to one???  Oh wait there is a pic but no description or part # I
&gt; think in the parts manual on Thoms site.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the link to the pics I have and Thoms site
&gt; 
&gt; http://briefcase.yahoo_dot_com/westfalia1
&gt; 
&gt; The one in the parts manual is straight, and the one I have is curved...I'd
&gt; 
&gt; take either one.  So all you anti stock exhaust folk out there or anyone
&gt; else...please see if you have one or two.  I'd appreciate it!!!
