Subject: RE: [VB] Forged or not

Hmmm, this is not working I can see. Standard VW cranks for T-1, T-2 to '71,
and T-3 to 71, are cast. They good for their intended purpose, but they are
still cast. Better check your Bentleys, Wilson, Clymer and whatever else.
Now other people make after market forged cranks and have since the late
fifties, Berg and Okrassa are just two of dozens world wide that do this. I
don't want to get into a pissing match with you because I don't know
everything. I have only been rebuilding VW engines since 1969 when 40 hp was
the easiest to get used and there were still quite a few 36 and 25 hp's to
be had, but some small details like this are too easy to look up. Please do.

As per Bergs site, &quot;The ultimate in VW crankshafts.
Berg cranks are a true fully forged crankshaft as are
the VW factory crankshaft and the Okrassa. All other
aftermarket crankshafts are hammered to outside shape
without proper grain orientation. Ours are done in the
original VW forging dies that we had modified for
additional cheek width, stroke length, plus we have
added the maximum counterweight which will fit in the
case. 
I dunno....and no, I don't work for him!
