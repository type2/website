Subject: Re: [VB] Help Installing Deep Oil Sump

if you use the nut closest to the exposed end of the stud to remove it, it 
will likely remove the nut from the stud.   Use the one closest to the engine 
case.

 &gt; 1. How do I get those studs for the oil drain cover plate out (so I can put
 &gt; the new, longer ones in?
 
 You could try the two nut trick.  Put two nuts on the stud, put the first on 
on
 just enough to make room for the second one.  Screw the second nut onto the
 stud and then tighten the two nuts together.
 
 You can then use the bottom nut to put the wrench on and turn the stud out of
 its hole.
