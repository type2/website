&gt;   Go to www.vintagebus_dot_com and look at the wiring diagrams so nicely

&gt; there for your help. This should eliminate any questions you should

hahaahahahah...yeah...i definitely understand wiring diagrams. no, i 
understand some of them, a little bit, but it would be easier to see a 
real life picture instead of a perfectly segmented color coordinated 
(which isnt how mine is AT ALL) totally fictional diagram of something 
that does'nt relate to my wiring at all. they should draw the wiring 
diagram all tangled up and un matched colors with electrical tape 
holding connections together and wires tied to the deck lid.
