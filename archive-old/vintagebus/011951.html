&gt; Alternatively, if you have a pickup truck, you can use the bed as one
&gt; datum and subtract your arm measurements from it to get the final
&gt; results. I suppose you could do the same with any other bus, suing the
&gt; floor.

This works fine, but it's a bit easier if you level things up.  That
way you don't have to figure out which angle to add or subtract from
the trailing arm angles, which I seem to mess up when I try to get
fancy and forgo the leveling step.  :)
