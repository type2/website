I am going to add onto Ronnie's post for three reasons.  One, the Porsche
engine will not run correctly in a heavy bus and you could end up blowing it
up pretty quick.  Two, if there are any engine problems the Porsche parts
will me more costly than VW parts.  And lastly, you could probably slap that
engine on E-bay and make a few grand for a decent VW motor.

&gt;I've had no luck in scrounging up a VW engine for free, but... yes, an
offer of a genuine Porsche engine. &lt;
Talk about lucky!

&gt;Do you think I use it until I build an engine that doesn't require $900
parts? &lt;
VW engines are simple beasts and run great even in poor condition.  Just
because most of the listies here are anal about the motors does not mean 90%
of the old VWs on the road have ratty/neglected motors.  Go to a junkyard
and pull a running used motor for cheap.  My local junkyard sells crappy
used running engines for $350 (maybe installation included), probably
cheaper than that on the west coast.

Be patient and let the VW karma catch up to you... God knows it left me
years ago so it is floating around waiting to find someone :)
