Subject: RE: 15&quot; tires on '66 Westi PLUS more information for 14&quot; rims!

Here is some follow up information I have received from helpful people and a
few more findings that may be of interest.

First off it seems that the Pirelli tires are the way to go for me (YMMV,
also will need to research some Kumho possibilities).  The guy/shop I buy
tires from only carries the mainline brands and gives the wheels the &quot;white
glove&quot; treatment which will be important for the Porsche Fuchs alloys...
With a steal wheels money  talks since the mounting is not a factor :)  

Pirelli Scorpion S/T for $74 a pop.

Look at that load rating for the &quot;C&quot; tire!

The one thing I have noticed is that some of the tire retailers are pushing
the Pirelli S/T in the &quot;P&quot; load rating and not the &quot;LT&quot;.  Be very careful on
this because you will want the &quot;LT&quot; with the &quot;C&quot; load rating...  Sears is
offering the &quot;P&quot; version for $59.99 which is a great deal, maybe they will
price match for the &quot;LT&quot;?  I will try and stop by after work and see if they
will.

If you are in the market for 14&quot; rims or a different choice for the 15&quot;
check out the Cooper tires. Thanks to Greg McKinney for putting me on the
Cooper trail.  These should priced pretty fairly.

and this for &quot;D&quot; load 14&quot;s in 185 and 195!!!

Eric &amp; Barb sound like they are goin' muddin' with 235/75R15s!  Whew, those
are some big meats to fit in the back :)  Seriously though, there is a great
selection of that size of tire for anyone needing that kind of off-road
traction. 

Also reference the www.westfalia_dot_org website for more tire information.
Lots of information !  A great site that doe not get much action, not sure
why.

And here are the traditional recommendations:
-Yokohama Y360  http://www.yokohamatire_dot_ca/main/index.htm
-Bridgestone 603V available in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; load ranges  
-Kumho seems to have a bunch of possibilities in the 852 (only 14&quot; but &quot;D&quot;
load), 824 Venture HT (15&quot; only, &quot;C&quot; load), and 825 Venture AT (15&quot; only,
&quot;C&quot; load). http://www.kumhotireusa_dot_com/pages/lt_main.htm  I have been very
very pleased with a set of ECSTA Supra 712 tires, so I may have to look into
these options.
-Michelin http://tires.michelin-us_dot_com/  For the money they do not seem as
good as some lower cost options.  The max load weight seems low for what you
are paying for.
