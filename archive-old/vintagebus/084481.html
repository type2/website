&gt; I've seen a version of this somewhere, but I can't find it at the moment:
&gt; jack up the Bus, put a pencil on top of a box so it is close to and/or
&gt; just touches the rim, and spin the rim by hand - see if the rim gets
&gt; closer to the pencil and/or the pencil stops making marks on the rim.

Bob Hoover describes this method for blueprinting rims in the TULZ
series he posted to ramva back in 2000.  You can find it by doing a
google groups search for 'veeduber tulz'.  Enco sells an imported dial
indicator and magnetic base for around $20, which would be easier and
more precise than the pencil and feeler gauge technique.

I made a drum puller out of a pair of rims that were bent out of spec
by welding them together so that the insides face one another.  A
steel bar is also welded across the diameter of one of the rims.  The
rim without the bar gets bolted to the stuck drum, which leaves just
enough space between the axle and the steel bar to insert a small
bottle jack to push the drum off.
