 I thought i would finally get around to installing the front door seals I got
 from bus depot last year. I took them out of the package and they aren't 
quite
 the same as the original. The orignal were grey foam-type rubber. Suliod all
 the way through, with the one going across the top of the door having a non
 square profile(alittle but like a u-shape)
  &gt;&gt;

don't knew what brand you were using.   I saw the WW grey rubber seals and 
was not impressed, the consistancy was all wrong, and in some places the 
contour as well.  like you say, some of the grey rubber originally had a U 
channel on one side.    

The WCM grey rubber is much better, a friend put some on his mom's DD panel 
and it was surprisingly nice.   I would get some but I am cheap and use used 
original grey rubber I snagged from junkyards.
