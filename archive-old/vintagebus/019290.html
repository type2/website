I think that was a later gate (ie baywindow)

drew wrote:
&gt; i used to own a '63 single cab and the rear gate had 2 holes in it so
&gt; that when the gate was dropped, you could still see the tail lights. it
&gt; looked stock, but i've yet to see that type of gate again. did i have
&gt; something ultra rare or just a good hack job?
&gt; any info would be appreciated. i no longer have the pickup, but have
&gt; wondered this for some time now.
