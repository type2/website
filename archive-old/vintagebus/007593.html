Here in AZ the rule is that you must have eye protection. No windshields
required. Driving with the safaris open and no eye protection indicates some
deeper issues anyway. Few rules though. Never follow a livestock trailer too
closely. Or let them pass you for that matter. Never follow anything closely
at all. Some of the stuff that cars can kick up will make you fill your
shorts when it is arcing towards your melon. Never drive past the flower
farms on Baseline Road, talk about your bee catchers. Never smile when it is
above 110 degrees, it will remove the enamel from your teeth. Other than
that, enjoy them.
