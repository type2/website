Hi NQ and Rob,
VW issued thier shops with a hand pump to pressurize through the spark plug 
the cylinder needing a valve spring replaced and a lever/compressor fixture 
that would bolt to into where the rocker arms mounted.  You could pressurize 
each cylinder with shop air and a modified threaded compression tester.  The 
fixture could be easily fabricated with an old rocker shaft and the 
compressor lever for this made with hand tools and possilbly a welder.
