&gt;i just read an article in Hot VW's about the heating system.  AND as
I recall, that gap has the purpos of making sure your heaterboxes don't
melt
down when you have the heater box flap closed (for summer and stuff)&lt;

Well....

Interesting point.  Maybe it wasnt that good of an idea.  For now, I have
&quot;fresh&quot; &quot;heat&quot; that &quot;eminates&quot; &quot;proudly&quot;.  I dare someone to search the
archives by crossing these words...

I would like to hear from someone that has ever experienced, or even heard
of  such &quot;heater box melting'.  I may be wrong, but I bet they joke about
other T2'ers that are still freezing.
