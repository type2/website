&lt;&lt; BTW: 12v was an option from '64 on (correct year, Clara?), so there are
 older gauges that should be 12v (unless VW used a voltage drop, which I
 doubt).  &gt;&gt;
 

My friend had a 63 panel that was 12 volt option. The guage face looked
similair to a ghia, not like the normal bus face. But the bezel was shaped
like a bus bezel.
