&gt;They are both Right Hand Drive
&gt;(RHD) as Thailand is a RHD country.  They also have a sliding
&gt;cargo door on the left hand side rather than the standard swinging
&gt;cargo doors.  Both are complete including the middle seats. The
&gt;Kombi is a daily driver, the deluxe is without a motor. The only
&gt;hack is to the bumpers and apron for a beetle exhaust.  I'll
&gt;try to get pictures posted soon.


Oooooh yeah - someone needs to get ahold of these babies.  Talk about rare
rare rare!!!
