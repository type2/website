&gt; I can't tell if the date code is 8-5x or 8-6x, but if it's 6x, maybe
&gt; these are early Type 3 wheels?  Googling around says Type 3 wheels
&gt; have a 46 mm offset and should be marked &quot;46&quot; or &quot;ET 46&quot; somewhere.

It very clearly says &quot;56&quot;

Upon closer inspection, only one wheel has the KPZ logo - the others
are VW.  One of the others has a 'x|61' date code, the other 2 don't
have anything.  The one with the '61 code also has a marking &quot;S5779&quot;
