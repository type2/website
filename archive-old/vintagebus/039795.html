&gt;bring a small rolling floor jack.  I heard the roads aren't so great, so
&gt;bring a board as well, so you can create a flat area the jack does not sink
&gt;into.
&gt;small folding shovel
&gt;at least two spare tires- did you read the inuvik story- they had lots of
&gt;flat tires, and expect your windsheilds to get cracked from rocks kicked 
&gt;up.
&gt;maybe 3 spares.  Hm, maybe a roof rack if you don't have one.

I replyed before I read this post, but its good to see that we are thinking 
along the same lines. Tires, and a way to change them. YEP YEP.
