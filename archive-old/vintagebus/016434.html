Subject: 1958 KOMBI 4-SALE OHIO
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

1958 VW Kombi Bus very solid vehicle with only some
minor rust. Correct small tailights. Is currently
running and driving nicely, but would like to sell the
bus minus the current engine as it is a brand new
built engine with mucho $$$ invested. I will sell with
the current engine and do have the original running
36hp and another used dual port available at extra
cost. I was looking for $1500 OBO am open to all
offers and trades for a later split bus preferably a
66-67 or even a `68-`79 Westfailia pop top. Also
interested in early bug stuff split and oval and even
any verts.

Tds
