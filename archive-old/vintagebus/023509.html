Does anyone have a contact number or address for the guy who has
reproduced the mint green material with the graph style lines on it.
Used on door panels for '62-'63-'64 and other year buses that were
painted Turquoise.
Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary and list

I met this guy a few times, and most recently this year at the Phoenix Bug-O-
Rama. His name is Doug and he has come together with a few other companies to
reproduce the Como Green interior used on the 63-64 Deluxe busses. The
interior in question is the two-tone green with black mesh printing. I've seen
the new panels matched up to an older set. Looked identical. I'd buy the set
for my 63 deluxe w/ como green int. but kinda pricey as of now.
If anybody wants his number they can p-mail me, as far as I know he's not
wanting his phone number posted to the internet.
The latest going price was $1500 for a complete set of panels. Vinyl not sold
seperately last I knew of.

Good luck to those who buy
