Subject: Re: [VB] More horn diagnosis...

Hi Bill,
First clean away the crud on the backside rim of the horn and check to make 
sure it is the correct voltage horn for your bus!  A 12 volt horn on a six 
volt system will not work well.
  Next remove the screws/nuts or drill out the rivets and later replace with 
screws/nuts around the rim of the horn.  Mark the front and rear of the horn 
so as to make sure you replace them the same way back together.  Carefully 
pry the two halfs of the horn apart to inspect for burnt/broken parts and if 
everything looks good clean the points inside it.  Assemble the two halfs 
back together and with the headlights on test the horn.  Most likely to get 
it working correctly you will need to clean off the points adjusting screw on 
the back of the horn and adjust till the horn is loud and clear even with the 
draw of the headlights.  After adjusting this screw paint over this screw to 
prevent water getting into the horn later through there.

PS Since you are going through all the trouble of cleaning all the 
connections in your bus make sure to grease them with vaselene or a 
professional dielectric grease to help ward off corrosion from exposure to 
our 18% oxygen atmosphere which will occur otherwise all too soon.
