I know they're commerically available; I think eastwood has
them, HF might have them too.  Those would be good if you
were not trying to work on the car.

&gt; I'm not necessarily replying about the bus, but if you look at the auction and at the pictures, I'm interested in the little individual wheel dollies that allow you to roll the bus in any direction (like right up against a wall in a 1 car garage).

&gt; I'm sure these are easily produced if you have welding capabilities, but I dont have them.  Are they commercially available?  I'd love a set of 4.
