The front rack on the Westfailure howls at 60mph and above. At lower speeds
in headwinds, higher in tailwinds. You can push that up some and cut the
drag down a bit by helping the aerodynamics of it a tad. Get some small
angle metal, aluminum probably, say 1/2 inch. Hose clamp it to the leading
edge of the first couple of crossmembers of the rack and the top rail. Make
the leading edge pointy. If painted to match it isn't too noticeable. I
haven't done it to my rack because I happen to like the howl. Lots of guys I
know with those monster ladder racks on their work trucks do this, of course
on bigger pipe than our little racks use.

&gt; I don't have howl with my bus roof rack, but some people said they did.
What
&gt; kinds of racks are the howlers? so I know to stay away from them
