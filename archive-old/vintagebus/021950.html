&lt;&lt; they eliminated the stock oil cooler :(  instead... the person who rebuilt 
the motor decided to put an oil cooler on the front (FIF) of the fan shroud 
over the opening of the fan.  bad.  this does cool the oil...but blows more 
hot air over the engine...am i correct??  i do want this motor to last, and i 
plan on taking it out to remove this setup and install a doghouse fan shroud 
and cooler...or even a type 4 cooler if i get ambitious.&gt;&gt;
That is bad.  While it does spread the heat from the cooler over the entire 
engine instead of just one side it restricts the air being able to be sucked 
into the engine.  It is hard enough to suck in air at only 18 lbs. per sq. 
inch at sea level but to pull it through a cooler that is heating the air as 
it goes through making this air expand causing even more resistance to 
getting it through the cooler.  In the stock postions a cooler has alot more 
air pushed through it due to the fans ability of producing more pressure than 
suction!  On top of all this we bet you have one of those cheapy oil coolers 
that has round tubes through it for the oil to pass through.  ROUND tubing is 
not good due to the back half of each of these tubes is in an air eddy of 
it's own making.  Thus half of the surface area of these tubes are not 
cooling the oil effectively.  Plus round tubes tend to allow a cooler layer 
of oil on the inside surface of these tubes to cling while a hotter current 
of oil passes down the center of the round tubing.  The stock cooler use 
tubing flattened into a thin rectangle shape which avoids the creation of 
both the hot center current and a large % of the eddy behind it due to the 
much thinner profile.  The doghouse and type 4 coolers are both better due to 
the plate design which elimenates even more of the back eddy per surface area 
produced.   Eric&amp;Barb

 &lt;&lt;The bus still has the triangular air filter bracket...which i will need to 
mount on the
 fan shroud....don't know how yet...but i'll figure that out later. &gt;&gt;
It mounts by being pinned by the coil to the shroud.   Eric&amp;Barb
