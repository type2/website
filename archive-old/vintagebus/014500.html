&lt;&lt; My brother has an early 1963 bug that has been in the family for its entire
 life.  It came with stale air heating.  In fact everytime we have to order
 things like a muffler for it, the parts houses always said that the year was
 wrong, so we got into the habit of telling them that it was a 1962 model.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
As long as you order a 40HP muffler you can always untab the heater bubble 
tins off of the #4 &amp; 2 cylinder exhaust pipes of fresh air mufflers.
 
&lt;&lt;Were production runs of bugs different from buses? &gt;&gt;
If you mean for engines, for the most part yes.
 
 &lt;&lt; Interesting, though, about the interior fins.. I didn't know they were 
there. 
 I had never dissected one that far down. &gt;&gt;
To check that a heat exchanger has the interior fins you hold a flashlight 
against the side of your head so your eyesight is as close to alignment of 
the light beam as possible.  Then look up the rear end of the heat exchanger 
where the muffler connects.  Just about 3-4&quot; inside on either of the insides 
you should be able to see the fins or the inside of the round tube if it is 
the earlier J-tube or cheap Dansk heat exchanger.    Eric&amp;Barb
