If anyone in NoCal wants a tree or two to take down and has some ROOM -
I have 2 norfolk pines in containers, one about 12', the other 6' that
I've been wanting to go to a good home in the ground.  This would be
perfect!

I want to hold on to the big pots they're in, so we'd need a large tarp,
just slip it out of the pot onto the tarp and wrap up the whole tree for
transport.  I probably even have the tarp.

Someone do this, please!

Teri
