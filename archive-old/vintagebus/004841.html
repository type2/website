I think that there may be a more serious problem.  I did a complete tune-up
including valve adjustment and guess what, a 30/31 PICT wouldn't idle
eather.
I have no clue at to the internals of the engine as I suscribe to the &quot;if it
runs, don't f**k with it&quot; school.  I've been running it for about 2yrs with
no problems.  All I've done to it is oil changes and tune-ups and it hasen't
( until now ) let me down as a daily driver.
Oh, well, I guess it's time to really tear into it.

&gt; sounds like you're having a tough time.
&gt; What is the rest of the motor like?
&gt; i.e. stuck/ loose clearance valves, loose heads, intake manifold etc.
&gt; etc.
&gt; on the vacuum leak test, you checked the hoses etc. all tight right? did
&gt; you let the motor revs down to just-before-die and squirt your carb
&gt; cleaner (I hope you are using berymen's not gumout) around the intake
&gt; manifold to head gasket ? no increase in revs? good. Did you check power
&gt; to your cut-off solenoid with a test light?
&gt; don't despair
&gt; aloha
