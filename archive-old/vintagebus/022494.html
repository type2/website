Hear hear!

&gt;With each passing year, our splitties' funk factor grows. Every new car
&gt;with power windows, rectangular headlights, keyless entry,automatic
&gt;doors, and three-foot-long tail lights makes the simplistic beauty of
&gt;our busses more distinguished.
&gt;
&gt;Should you improve your bus? YES! Better brakes,bigger engine,seatbelts,
&gt;Great.Make it safer and more fun to drive,but try to keep as many of the
&gt;wierd original features as you can. Or buy a newer Bus.
