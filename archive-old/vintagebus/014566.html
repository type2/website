The rear hatch glass on our '67 is scratched and I would like to replace
it. Does anyone know if replacement glass is available that is tinted in
the glass - dark privacy tint?  I'm not wild about the tint films which
get nicked around hatches. I think the stock glass is tempered.  Can
this piece be replaced with a laminated glass?  I can't think of any
reason why laminated could not be used. The original glass could be used
as a template for a custom cut laminated glass, since tempered can't be
cut after tempering.  My Ford van uses laminated in the side windows,
but tempered in any glass that is moved - front, side &amp; rear doors.
Except my other van with a slider door uses laminated. I've also seen
tempered in the side windows, too. I suspect tempered glass might be
cheaper to use and mold.

you can use tempered or laminated.      call you r friendly local glass shop,
and ask about prices and if tinted glass is available.   Having a template is
good, but be aware that they don't cut it perfectly, and you have to be
careful with laminated or it'll break.   Tempered, that stuff is tough.  I
dropped an intake manifold ten feet onto a piece of tempered glass and it just
bounced.

VW buses used tempered through 60 on all windows, laminated 61-63, and the
back to tempered.   US spec buses have laminated windsheilds, euro spec
tempered.    Having your bus with the other than standard type for its
destination was an option as well.

Maybe you could find a cleaner piece of original rear glass.  the bay window
rear glass is the same size through 72 (?) - if you don't mind defogger lines
