&gt; I'm not trying to be a cop or anything, but wouldn't photocopying manuals
and then selling them, even for a good cause, be considered slightly
illegeal in, oh, just about anywhere?

As Rick stated at the heater seminar, he got permission over the phone from
them to sell photo copies.  They realize that via this distribution, they
increase their chance of sales.
