&lt;&lt; Hi Jim,
 As usual it depends on what year bus you have.  If it is from the latter part
 of 1967 model production then the switch is on the nose of the tranny.  If it
 is an earlier model it should have a switch bolted somewhere along the shift
 linkage.  Eric &amp; Barb &gt;&gt;

Hi Eric &amp; Barb,
   I have never experienced one of those shift linkage switches. All of the
earlier than 67 buses with back up lights that I have seen, have the switch
behind the speedo, inline with the speedo cable. When you start backing up,
the switch then opens because........the speedo cable is also turning
backwards.
