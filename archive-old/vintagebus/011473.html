Hello all,

I'm about to send out the &quot;Busses By the Arch #14&quot; flyer to those 
of you who are already on our event mailing list.  The event this 
year as usual will be held over the Labor Day holiday weekend, 
Sept. 4th-7th, 1998 on the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri.  If you 
normally receive the flyer, but have moved within the last 12 months, 
quickly fire off (privately to me, not the list) the following updated 
info for our event database:  your updated pmail address, phone #, 
email address, and if you'd like, the year(s) and model(s) of your 
current VW's and any VW clubs you currently belong to.  If you are 
planning to attend &quot;Busses By The Arch #14&quot; and don't normally 
get the flyer, then quickly send me the same info and you shall 
receive one also.  You can expect to see them in you mailbox by 
early next week.  As I'm not on the Vanagon List, could someone 
who is post this message to that list for me?  Thanks!

Come join all of us at the largest gathering of Type 2's (and their 
devout enthusiast owners) in the Midwest.  See ya around the 
campfires!

Bill Bowman
