Since it's Friday, this is now a safe topic, and I know that it directly 
affects some of the people on the lists.

VWOA (Volkswagen of America) has recently sent out letters, thru their
attorneys, to everyone who has a domain with &quot;VW&quot; &quot;Volks&quot; &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
&quot;Bug&quot; or &quot;Beetle&quot; in the name.  Some domains have already disappeared;
they're still in InterNIC records, but not in DNS.  I'm sure there 
are other domain elements targeted as well.  

Porsche started something similar a couple of months ago.

As expected, this has caused quite a stir in rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
The water cooled people seemed to be be pretty clueless on the matter,
which was to be expected.

This is a legal matter, and not really a VW matter.  Everyone
seems to have a different opionion on this issue.  Discussion got
very ugly on the porsche list, and I'd prefer if that didn't happen
here.

If you wish to comment on this on the list, please do so in a rational,
well thought out, polite manner.  It's probably too much to ask, but
if anyone has access to an online law library like Westlaw, it would
be fun to corroborate the various Perry Mason's rulings with what
The Man has to say.

If any of you are on the vanagon list and want to forward this, feel free.

I guess I'll have to put the kibosh on my plans for &quot;vintagedasher_dot_com&quot;
