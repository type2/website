Subject: Re:  [VB] i think i toasted my engine
To: westy66_at_hotmail_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


speaking of which... i think i toasted my engine cuz of my small nut. it 
seems to be leaking oil everywhere. around cylinders, push rods, everywhere! 
seems to be a big power loss too. im sooooo bummed. i finished painting it 
the tuesday before last, drove it in my wedding that saturday and while i 
was on my honeymoon it took a sh#t. :( i guess i knew cruising at ~4500rpm 
would do something.

did you do a compression check?    check the head torque?

I would not blame it on the small nut, but it seems like you do not want the 
low gearing that  comes with the small nut 4.375 you have, so i say change 
it.   cause you'll do it again if you drive it like it isn't geared for.    
and it isn't geared for freeway driving.

......
is there any way to know if a tranny is any good out of the vehicle? my big 
nut from my other '66 seemed ok, it grinded downshifting into second though. 
i wouldnt want to put it in and have to take it right back out.
......
not really- you said you drove on it though- so you can either say you know 
it grinds into 2nd, and use it, knowing it will have a limited life, or pay 
for a rebuild and hope that will extend its life.  depends on money and your 
tolerance for noises I would say-  and do you want to put it together knowing 
the trans is less than perfect.  I bought a $35 swap meet transaxle drum to 
drum with new brake parts and put it in a bus and it whined from day one, but 
not too much,  and got about 30K miles out of it, I was happy.      No way of 
telling how many miles you would get.  i stopped mine when I decided the 
noises were too bad, and I know the synchros had been going (brassy sheen to 
drained trans oil, shifting into 2nd getting harder, also wierd noise from L 
RGBox)
