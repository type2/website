I have just reached 30,000 miles on my Mexican VW factory engine, I have
duel Kadrons and 1.25 ratio rockers and stock exhaust, The bus has a stock
66 trans in it I run at 65-68 MPH at all times, gas mileage around 20mpg
with =out trailer and loaded roof rack and between 16-17 loaded, ( I just
finished a 800 mile road trip, 1 way with trailer and loaded rack, no tow
and empty rack back), this was all done in 100 plus heat 80 percent of the
time, left Havasu in 115 degrees arrived back 110 degrees. I haven't had a
problem in all these miles (I do have a compufire in it and NGK B5ES plugs)
except I did loose a fuel pump this morning, checked my oil and had a quart
to much! Pulled the fuel pump and changed it, drained the oil and changed
the filter (I do have a filter pump) and off I went (300 more miles).
 I am about to retire this engine after the Classic weekend when I install
my new engine trans combo (see past post). I will probably tear it down and
see what kind of wear I have after 30,000 plus miles and report to all list
with the results. This way we will all know how hard I can abuse a new
engine and see had much excessive wear it might have.

&gt; i just got a 1600 dual port for clyde and i was wonder
&gt; your opinions on these motors. does anyone have one of

&gt; have it set up with dual weber 34's, bosch 009,
&gt; lightened flywheel, and empi gt-style muffler. how
&gt; much hp do you suppose this will put out? i'm assuming
&gt; it will be significantly greater than my old 1300 with
&gt; bad compression and a wobbly crankshaft pulley...

I have two of them I bought from Ronnie at Old Volks.  After 2000 miles on
each they are working fine.  One has a slight oil weep (bottom of
engine is a bit moist, but never drips), the other is
completely dry.

I don't know if I would want to hot-rod these engines without opening them
up and going through them.  You'll probably want to run more compression
and swap the crank for a counterbalanced one.

All in all, I'm quite happy with them in the stock configuration.
