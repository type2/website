Subject: Loose ends

Hi Folks,
Hey it's coming up on friday and I've got some loose Volkswagen ends I wanted
to
catch up on. Maybe some one can help.
Last year a fella posted something about a movie he was shooting about John
Muir
author of &quot;The idiot book&quot;  I recall he expected to &quot;wrap&quot; his project up
about October last
year. Does anyone know if the project was completed? possibly available to
view?

Another issue I wonder about. As I recall, late last year time frame some lady
on her way
to someplace in Arizona? had her bus catch fire and burn to the ground.
There were all sorts of posts on how the &quot;community&quot; was gonna come together
and get the
lady another bus. The hat was passed, and folks wrote impassioned posts about
the benifits of her
getting a &quot;bay&quot; or a &quot;split&quot;. Quite a few more wrote excellent posts on fire
safety (I certainly learned a lot)
and then....not another  &quot;mumbling word&quot;. What ever happened? Did she ride off
into the sunset in
another bus, or what?
Does anyone know?

Mike Turner
