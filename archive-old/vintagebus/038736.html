&gt; Hellllo,
&gt; I'm having a difficult time deciding what to do here.  I built up my
&gt; engine and its *almost* done (top end rebuild basically) and I just need
&gt; to slap on the carbs and the breast tin.  I went out today and bought a
&gt; dial indicator to check my end play and am unsure of the results.  This
&gt; engine was rebuilt about 50,000 miles ago (I have receipts to verify
&gt; thanks to the PO's!) and as some of you may remember i got a washer in
&gt; the #1 cylinder back in the fall and just decided to do a top end
&gt; rebuild on the beast.  Well I checked the end play and the dial
&gt; indicator tells me that I have between .007&quot; and .008&quot; of play.  Bentley
&gt; says that it should be within 003&quot; and .005&quot; with a wear limit of
&gt; .006&quot;.  What should I do?  Should I tear the beast back down again and
&gt; get the shortblock rebuilt or should I just shim it?  If I were to shim
&gt; it how long may I expect it to last?  I realize its just a band aid, but
&gt; I want to drive my bus, but yet I don't want the thought of that looming
&gt; over my head, unless it really isn't that bad.  The engine ran wonderful
&gt; before I took it out, but I got that washer in the #1 cyl some how when
&gt; I was replacing PR tube seals just after I got back from BNNTA last fall
&gt; and I thought I would just &quot;freshen&quot; it up.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, what to do what to do?
&gt; Opinions anyone?

Before you start, remove the three shims that are in the engine already and
take them to someone who has a micrometer. Printed on each shim is the
thickness measurement. If you can read it, compare what's printed on the
shim to its current thickness; I bet they're not the same.

Someone around here knows what the no-shim endplay limit is. If you can get
that number, check the endplay without any shims installed. If you're within
the no-shim endplay limit, knock .003 off the no-shim endplay, order three
new shims that add up to that thickness, and put 'em in.

It will last until (1) you wear the bearings down or (2) the shims wear.
