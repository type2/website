The whole weekend was great, The Red Barn swap and camp-out was a must be,
great deals and buship and not to many people, the camp-out in some wooded
forest in somewhere up north was great, and a special Thanks to our weekend
host Split Bus Club they treated us foreigners with respect and dignity.

Now on to Kelly Park, who organized this event? After 1 1/2 hours we were 1
of the last contingents in to park, there were 15 or so buses in our caravan
to Kelly Park, so that was fun, but getting in sucked, reminded me of an Al
Martinez So. Cal farce. But once in it was awesome, the area, the people,
the parts, the buses (screw the water pumpers and take the antifreeze out of
the new beetle), It was great that Thom talked his buses way in and even had
the honor to park next to the Havasu boys. Met a load of listys that I have
never met and met even more of my customers from all over the country, so
they do come from all over, I did find a bunch of parts for my deluxe and
the prices were real good, saw the same bus w#ores selling the same
overpriced stuff they can't sell at Pomona or the other shows I see them at,
but if you need it, they have it, of course I did get bit#hed at for wanting
200 dollars for my unused original early childs cot, but try to find one and
I've had it for years and probably will for a couple more and the price will
just keep going up.

Now, on to the bus. I got a call a few weeks or so ago about a bus (single
cab) that has been setting for 30 or so years, but it was so far away I
didn't feel like driving to see it, but it did work out to be not to far out
of the way from KP to here, so on the way back VW Howard and I stopped to
check it out. When we got there I saw this single cab converted to a flat
bed truck in the back yard, with a small crane on it and thought O'well if
it's cheap enough I'd buy it to use around the shop. Then I looked in the
garage and there was another single cab on jack stands that looked like it
was being restored and I thought to myself, there's no way this is it, it's
got to be the hack in the back for sale, then the owner appeared , we talked
about the hacked bus and he said that's his work truck and it was the one in
the garage for sale. John and I went in and checked it out STRAIGHT AS AN
ARROW, no RUST, all original single cab. The owner started to restore it and
stopped, it has NOS rear lights from Koch's he had bought years ago and all
the rubber to put together, no engine, it had a bastard 40 that threw a rod
at 34,000 miles, if the speedo he showed me was the one for the bus (I
imagine it was , as the date was a couple months before the buses) which was
02 09 09, he called it a 60, I called it a 59. As we checked out the parts I
was in awe, the gates were perfect, the bed, the parts everything, all it
needed is a paint job and it was about ready for that. The bummer was that
this bus was all original paint and the owner sanded most if it down, o'well
now I'll have to paint it, yes I did buy it, it wasn't a steel but I feel
worth every dime as it needs absolutely no body or rust repair. So I will be
off to pick it up in 2 weeks and heck, maybe I'll have it done for the
classic! I've done it before.

Now to sleep

Ronnie   old volks of az
