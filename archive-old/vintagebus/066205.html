Subject: RE: [VB] Berg shifters

Berg shifters are very nice.

I bought a used one from Ronnie and am pleased with it.

The only beef I have heard and seen is that the reverse lockout is near 
impossible to get right.  Mine does not work either, so I have to be careful 
on 3&gt;2 shifts.

Overall you could not pay me to go back to the stock shifter!

Later,
Adrian
