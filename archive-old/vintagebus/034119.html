You should have went for it! First of all in a mag shoot they pay the owner
to stand by, you also get monies for the use of the bus, you get paid for
all damages incurred during the shoot and while your bus would have been
sitting around. They have a professional car (exmp; BADA, Beat Auto
Detail)prep company due all the mods and prep  to your bus, etc. etc.,
bummer you could have probably walked with at least 5 g's in your pocket for
letting a bunch of almost naked women sit around in your bus and you could
have stayed and watched, if your into that kind of thing. I base my
knowledge on experience as I used to drive motor homes part time for TV and
AD photo shoots, and I got paid handsomely for doing this.

To clarify things a little more about what they wanted in a bus for the
photo 
shoot...

A few months back, Playboy called me looking for a bus to use in this shoot,
