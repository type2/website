Ok, I think its the linkage, as was said before. The choke is just staying
wide open..even after i adjusted it. I took the carb off AGAIN, adjusted
choke, got it all to work when i worked the linkage w/carb off motor. Then i
hooked it up, went to start it, and the same thing. Revs up really high and
WON'T stop. Went back and looked at choke, was wide open and not closing
back up. There seems to be some sort of cam that comes down off the choke
and goes underneath the fast idle arm, so it can be actuated w/using
accelerator pedal. But, the cam isn't big enough to fit under the arm
without falling out. I am beginning to hate this, and don't want to spend
money having a mechanic come over here, but I'm on my last legs here.
Thanks.
Brad
