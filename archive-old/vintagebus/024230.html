Subject: Re: '67 Spindle Thread Size
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's the answer, thanks to Jason for the great 
list of thread sizes.  I narowed it down (and measured)
to determine that I needed an M18x1 die.  I called
every tool distributor in Sacramento (over 15 places)
to find only one in San Francisco that had it, and 
even then would only COD it to the tune of $20.
(I didn't want to have to have SO deal with that)

I called Baum Tools to find that the price Jason
listed would actually be around $40, not $10.77.

In desperation, I called Snap-On tools.  I didn't
expect to find it, and if per chance they had it,
expected to have it priced out of reach.  Surprise,
surprise, the have it for $13.  I'll get it early
next week as it had to be brought in from the 
warehouse in Carson City, NV.

Snap-On is nationwide, so give 'em a try.
I'm just glad I don't need a die for the LEFT
side using left handed threads.

Baum Tools Unlimited carries the size you need, 
Their number is 1-800-848-6657 
18 X 1 R stub axle, 1500 transporter, right $10.77 Front Spindle '64 up
18 X 1 L stub axle, 1500 transporter, left $20.40  Front Spindle '64 up

I had earlier written: 
&gt; What is the front spindle thread size for a '67? 
&gt; It would be the same size as on '64 through 
&gt; the early loafs. The threads on mine are damaged 
&gt; and I would like to run a die over them before 
&gt; re-assembling. I need to call around to buy, 
&gt; borrow, or rent such a beast and would like the 
&gt; proper size aforehand. Or at least be assured 
&gt; that I get a thread file with the proper size on it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Would someone please cross post to the Type2 list, 
&gt; thanks.
