Subject: Re: [VB] questions about early 64's

&gt;
&gt;On my early 64 kombi with the 15&quot; wheels I have a big nut tranny.
&gt;With 15&quot; wheels am I supposed to have a big nut tranny?

I think it's possible.  I have an early '64 (built November '63) and
it has 15&quot; wheels and big nuts.  The date codes on the wheels match
the Bus.  I don't know if the trans/RGBs are original but they appear
to be.

&gt;When did buses come with an optional 1500?  Never on a bus with 15&quot;
&gt;wheels right?

1500s were an option through the beginning of the '65 model year
(1 October 1964); after that the 1500 was standard.  The 1500 option
seems to have started with the 1963 model year.  One-ton models went
to 14&quot; wheels in August 1963; regular models went to 14&quot; wheels in
December 1963.  It looks like big nuts came about in August 1963.

So it looks like you could have ordered a 1500 on a Bus with 15&quot; rims
for the 1963 model year.  For '64, if you ordered a 1500 with a one-ton
rating, you got 14&quot; wheels all year; if you ordered a 1500 with a normal
rating early in the year you got 15&quot; wheels - later you got 14&quot;.

My Bus has a 1500 from a '68 Beetle in it right now; I'm not sure
what it would have had originally.

&gt;Wouldn't the combination of taller wheels, optional 1500, and big nut 
&gt;tranny make it the fastest production bus?

Fastest production split, maybe.  Even though the bays were heavier,
the fuel-injected Type 4 engines could crank out a lot of power.

&gt;I guess I could look all this up myself, but it is faster and easier
&gt;to just ask first.

Wow!  Think of all the money you'll save on buying manuals and reference
books!
