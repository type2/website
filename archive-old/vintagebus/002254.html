Sorry for commandeering the bandwidth, but this is extremely time critical.

If you have access to a Comp USA store, they have L&amp;H Voice Express,
Advanced, Version 4, on sale through TODAY [Monday, 11-23-99].  With the
available rebate it's free, except for tax [if any].  The software package
includes a free headset with microphone.

This is a sophisticated program, claiming a 12 minute &quot;time to first
dictation&quot;.   It allows dictation into &quot;virtually all Windows applications&quot;
and includes voice control and commands, a 230,000+ word vocabulary, text to
speech, and more.

And you can't beat FREE.
