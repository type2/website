Subject: NQ List moderator?

&gt; Hey look....Erin's moderating the list.  Whoooo Hooo.  Free for all.
This
&gt; is great, it could be like guest hosting the Tonight Show.  King for a
&gt; week.   ;-)

Technically Thom is the moderator but since I've been on the VintagVW
listservs since 1993 or so, I've seen way too many of these name calling
things immediately blow up and go out of hand.  7 years of this repeat
behavior gets old and I really do treasure the lists I'm on - especially
vintagvw and vintagebus.  Anytime we have an instance of name calling, flame
bait, etc. whether I'm the list moderator or not, I'm going to jump in and
do my best to put a stop to it.  Over on the vintagvw list, there was this
guy named Bret who kept spamming out list with jpegs.  People kept
complaining and Bret would blatantly tell us all he would keep sending all
the pictures he wanted, when he wanted.  I reported him to John Sroka and
got him canned - didn't bother me a bit.  About 3 months later, a post was
made from a &quot;Bret&quot; but of course with a new email account.  Immediately I
posted, &quot;Aren't you the same Bret that we kicked off a few months ago?&quot;  His
reply was along the lines of yes that was me but give me a chance, I won't
spam the list.  He's actually turned out to be a regular contributing list
member.  I enjoy his posts.

Being a list moderator is a thankless job and I've seen other people burn
out from doing it.  I treasure the lists so much as a resource, that anytime
I see stuff that is inappropriate, I'll do whatever I can to stop it.
Better it come from me in the form of a polite, firm, and tactful suggestion
instead of King Thom himself for there lies the ultimate power - the power
to ban or accept list members at will.  Nobody needs worry about getting
deleted from their favourite VW list by me for I do not run any VW lists but
I try to help when I can due to my multiple previous experiences with such
emails and the results thereof.

NQ
