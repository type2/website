Subject: Re: [VB] vacuum dizzy upgrade problems

You can pull the distributor drive and turn it 90 degrees to accomodate the 
vacuum can. Muir suggests a method using a pencil that worked for me. Don't 
just jump into this though, read the manuals carefully and know what you are 
doing. There are some washers you really don't want to drop into the case. 
And remember to set the motor at TDC#1 before you pull the dizzy, it is much 
easier that way...
While I don't and haven't run a dual vacuum dizzy (vacuum advance and 
retard), I have heard negative things about them. I think they were one of 
those things VW did for smog control, not performance. Got to make up your 
own mind on that one.

&gt;Subject: [VB] vacuum dizzy upgrade problems
&gt;Date: Sat, 18 May 2002 13:46:18 -1000
&gt;
&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm trying to put a 0231 167 070 dual vacuum dizzy in my dual port 1600
&gt;and I'm having some problems.
&gt;
&gt;First, the rotor's orientation at Top Dead Center is different from my
&gt;009, approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the 009.
&gt;
&gt;Second, the base of the 070 is different from the 009 and has these
&gt;protruding areas for a couple screws- this makes it difficult to choose
&gt;the orientation of the dizzy because it interferes with the clamp for
&gt;the dizzy.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not quite sure what to do.  The 90-degree difference in rotor
&gt;location is bugging me.  Is this a good upgrade?  Where should I try to
&gt;line up the vacuum can- toward the front?  I'm totally confused here.
&gt;
&gt;Any help is appreciated,
&gt;
&gt;Chris
