Subject: Re: [VB] engine stand

I have a roll around engine stand I use when I rebuild 'other brand' 
engines.  I was given one of the bolt to the workbench VW stands.  I simply 
welded the mount of the VW type stand to the roll around stand and now have 
a multi stand that I can rebuild anything on.

FWIW, the VW type I have doesn't support the weight of a complete engine - 
the 'ears' bend.  I'm looking at the bell housing option and will make a 
plate'n pipe assembly to fit the regular stand.  With a little 
seat-of-the-pants engineering could also have the starter option for bench 
running for cam break in!

Gotta go, work calls.

     Nope,I have the same unit, bought for $39 on sale at harbor frt. Use it
for H2O engines. Also have the traditional 2 bolt VW stand that mounts to a
bench. Have thought about mounting the VW stand to the roll around stand but
it needs a bigger center mount.
