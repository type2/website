put on my '67 deluxe just to move it from point A to point B to do more work. 
This should work, right?  I will probably trailer it, so it really shouldn't 
matter, right?  &gt;&gt;

Hi AJ,
Even if you are going to trailer it best to get tires with at least 1525 Lbs. 
wieght limit rating!  That way when you do drive it you will have adequite 
tires.   Eric&amp;Barb
