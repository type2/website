Subject: Re: [VB] No Response - 2nd Try: Help Tuning My Bus

No, what's funny is when people who don't have dual carbs think those of 
us who do spend so much time on them. Just for the record, I don't spend 
any more time tuning my bus with dual carbs than I do tuning my truck 
which has a single carb. I rarely fool with the carbs on either one.

I like my electronic ignition too. 8^)
