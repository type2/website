&gt; I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966 production, 874th '67
&gt; off the line).  My production plate reads:
&gt;
&gt; 05 7

Hmmm.... this presents a question:
How many buses did VW build in one day??

My 67 Standard was built on 05 7 also. It is #000625.  If you subtract this
from yours, 874, that means at least 250 were built/assembled on July 5th?
