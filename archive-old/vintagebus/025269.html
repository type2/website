&gt; Hello, I hope that you don't mind if I ask your opinion on this:
&gt; I live in Austin TX since 18 years. I am originally from the Netherlands. I
&gt; was there last week and someone offered me a 1966 Volkswagen Ambulance Van
&gt; for sale, with the suggestion to bring it to the US, where they supposedly
&gt; sell wel. This Van has 30.000 miles, is in very nice shape, with all the
&gt; equipment, the stretchers, needles, oxygen bottles, manuals etc in it,. I am
&gt; not familiar with vans, I have a oval VW and that is it. This Ambulance bus
&gt; belonged to a well known german collector, Grobben or Grobbing and is
&gt; featured in a book on vans.
&gt; On the one hand, I am tempted to have an adventure and try to make some
&gt; money, on the other hand, this van costs incl freight, at least $10.000 and
&gt; seems fairly useless to me, except perhaps to a collector. I was also offered
&gt; some samba buses in nice shape, but I did not get around to inspect them. You
&gt; hear sometimes rumors, that these vans sell well, but I have no idea if there
&gt; is really a ready market where such vans change actually hands for around
&gt; $10000,-
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate it very much, if you gave me your opinion or advise on
&gt; this.
&gt; Thanks very much, Hans Rademaker .

Hans,
They do sell well. $10,000 is a high price, unless it is a very nice
bus. I'm not an ambulance guy. I would like to forward this to a list of
VW enthusiasts, and they will probably be able to tell you better than
I.
