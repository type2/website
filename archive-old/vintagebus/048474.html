Subject: Josh's Funeral Details

I have enjoyed reading all of your kind words and stories about Josh and
will print them out to be delivered to his close group of friends and
family in Ponca City, they could really use your support.

I talked with Chad and Brad who are two of Josh's close friends last night
(Tuesday) and they are beside themselves not knowing what to do.  Josh was
the &quot;ring leader&quot; of that close knit group of enthusiasts.  A bit of
history, for Chad's birthday a few years back, Josh bought a '67 Westy and
worked it over for him.  That was the type of friend Josh was.  It was
because of Josh that many people got their start in the hobby.  Chad did
tell me that he spent all day Sunday with Josh doing what they love to do
the most, hunting split window busses.  Chad said they had a good day
together, and he will remember that day for a long time.

Chad did also mention that it will be difficult to see Josh's favorite '69
red, white and blue daily driver around town and Josh's wishes were that it
go to someone who would enjoy it, so the tentative plans are to take it to
Busses By the Bridge and raffle it off, with the money going to his family.
We will post more information about purchasing tickets at a later date.

Josh gave a lot to the hobby, if you can, maybe you can let his family know
how much he meant to us.  Please send your flowers, gifts, donations and
cards to:

Four Square Church
c/o Rachel (pronounced Ra-shell) Rogers
700 West Broadway
Ponca City, OK   74601
(580) 762-2729

The Funeral will be at Four Square Church Friday December 18, at 2pm.
