They're for the optional rear speakers - I have a pic somewhere on my site of the brackets.

&gt; As I was working on my headliner, I found two wires, inside original housing
&gt; tucked in the rear driver's side roof corner of the bus.  They appear to
&gt; have always been there but never used.  They have the little metal endcap
&gt; things except with no indentations where the screws would have clamped down
&gt; on them.  I've looked on wiring diagrams to figure it out and to no avail. 
&gt; anyone have any clue as to why they were there?
