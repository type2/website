All this talk about DBH has reminded me that I have some replacement parts from them that I don't need any longer.  Here's what I think I have that I would sell for what I paid for it (check DBH's price list for appropriate prices):

2 rear outriggers (left and right)
2 front cab floor halves
2 pickup rear corners
1 inner rocker
1 outer rocker (left side)
1 short outer rocker (right side)

All of these pieces are in perfect shape; I unpacked them, put 'em away and haven't touched them in 6 to 9 months.  I'm trying to clean out the shop as I think I'm getting the boot this Summer.

I still have oak bed slats if anyone needs any, great prices for list members.  Double Cab sets are $105.00, Single Cab sets are $125.00.  Unfinished and no holes drilled.

Several cargo doors too.  High hinge panel doors with zero rust and zero dents, low hinge window cargo doors also.

Robert
