Subject: Re: [VB] Model year change

Well, model year production started on August 1, so if your bus was
produced on 10/29/64, it's a fairly early '65 model.  If it was produced
10/29/65, it's a fairly early '66 model.

&gt;I'm just full of questions today. My '65 DC was manufactured on Oct 29.
Does that mean it is an
&gt;early or very late '65?
