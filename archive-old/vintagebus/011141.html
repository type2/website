Hi Martin,
Yes used from 55-64.

&lt;&lt; Are these hard to find?&gt;&gt;

Depends where on the planet you are, or if you are on this planet.  Antartica 
is a real bugger of a place to find one!  Do check just in the bottom of the 
area just in front of your passenger kick panel it might have just fallen off 
and ended up there like the one in our 63 SC when we bought it!

&lt;&lt;What year did they change over to something more like the beetle?&gt;&gt;

1965.

&lt;&lt;Will it be easy to put on if I can get one? &gt;&gt;

If you can handle non-button fly jeans then you easily install one since they 
are literally a double snap.  Do apply a bit of grease in each socket to help 
reduce friction and future rust.
