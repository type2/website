That's not German on that page.... that's Slovak or Czech ... and this movie is a serial production
airing on Czech TV right now. At least that's what I think since Polish and Slovak are closely
related languages.

I'm trying to get more info from the Bus list in Poland about this movie....

peace,

Howdy VOLKS!

Regarding the picture seen here: http://www_dot_derkleinetorpedo_dot_com/membercars/cobra11.jpg
A little searching on the internet and one come up with...

Action Concept - a German filming and stunt production company based in Cologne.  They filmed a
movie called 'Alarm Fur Cobra 11' which it looks like there are several fans or fan sites.
http://www.alarmfuercobra11-fanclub_dot_de/

Here is Action Concept's site.  German and English versions available  - cool demo movies.

Here is the movie website.  Anyone read German?  (silly question on this list)
http://www.cobra11.aktualne.cz/index.html

Perhaps someone can get the movie and take a screen capture of the bus before it was blown up.  Less
depressing - at least for me.
