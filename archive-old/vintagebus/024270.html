Subject: &quot;Swappin' Lies&quot; (Fri. Sub.)

Hello all!
  You know, I absolutely LOVE to read all you folks' trip reports.  A
lot of you are excellent writers and have a talent for describing the
trials and tribulations of your adventures.  What I am curious about is
this thing called &quot;swappin' lies&quot;.  Ya'll say you have, but don't say
exactly what about!  So, I was wondering if I could read some of the
lies that are told at campfires and bus meets.  Also, what tales do you
tell non-bus-drivers?   I love to laugh and bet there are some real rib
crackers out there!
  So......lie to me!
