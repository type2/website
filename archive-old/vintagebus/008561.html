I'm trying to write a post right now about how my weekend went with Terry
and Rob while scouting out the Indian Cave Park where our event is to be
held.  I had a nice long chat with Pink Newell about the campout and the
events that we could do.  While I'm hammering away at the keyboard, enjoy
these pix that Terry Wolfe took while we were there.  Notice the little one
pump gas station we found about 20 miles out of the park, and then various
other pix such as the VW junkyard and army tank that we found in towns along
the way home.  I'm sure you'll agree the park is the prettiest place in
Nebraska and it will make one helluva place to have an event.  I'm really
excited about it.  Enjoy!
