&lt;&lt;  I recently saw the article in Hot VWs about installing Bosch H4 halogens
 on a '67 &amp; later bug.  That got me thinking, why not on my splitty?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Nate &amp; Denia,
We have run the Bosch H4s in a 1961 bug of ours, and now run indian made 
halogens that run about $30.00 a pair including bulbs in our 1960 panel 
camper, and  a mismatched set in our 1963 SC.  Yes, they are brighter than 
incandesent 12 or 6 volt sealed head light bulbs, but you have to totally 
clean ALL electrical connections thoughly throughout the whole wiring system. 
 As for fog, brighter is not going to help much unless you get fog lights.  
The lower the better!  Otherwise the closer the lights you use for fog are to 
the windshield, and your eyesight the more the light just gets reflected back 
off the fog into your eyes.
