a) I haven't heard of someone haveing RB problems soon after a complete
rebuild, unless it was pilot error
b) I wouldn't trust a carters box any farther than I could pick it up
(unh!) and toss it.  The first one I had, in the '56, was great, but
the one I got for the '55 is noisy and balky.  A friend of mine put one
in a '66 bug and it didn't last 5000 miles
