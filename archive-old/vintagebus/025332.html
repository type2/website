I saw 2 sets at the last Marin CA show.  The first was a complete Wolfgang set

for $400! (They're only $389 direct from Wolfgang.)  Another fella had originals,

just the frames in rough shape, with no (or broken) glass, for $300.  I passed

on both and will also be going with Izzs for my 67 deluxe.
