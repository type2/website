Subject: EveryBus 2004 - Been there done that!

Well folks last night I went up to the park let myself in and after a few 
minutes I was surrounded by Buses. I got there about 9:30 PM and there was 
already about 50-60 buses. Me in my big work truck, what a drag I couldn't 
drive &quot;el Verde&quot;. To all of those ducking out of site from the &quot;Park Ranger&quot; 
in the Red Truck with reflective Yellow Lettering, sorry. Didn't mean to 
kill it for you. At least I didn't use the spot light.  ;) Took that Webber 
off and met John Baker. Great guy brought me a Complete Fuel Injection off a 
78. Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. He seemed right at home with 
the progressive carb. Good luck to you BUSZEN. I can't say I was the first 
one there but, first to leave? Wish I could have stayed but work on Friday 
would not allow it. All this important stuff to do at work. Like check my 
emails for &quot;List Material&quot;. LOL. Looks like it is going to be a great event 
with the turn out so far.
