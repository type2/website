Hi
The awful white gunky stuff is just from condensation.  It's normal.  As
your engine cools down, the oil filler cap cools faster that the oil,
which is still evaporating water.  This water condenses on your filler
cap, mixes with the small amount of oil there, and magically becomes the
white stuff from the inside of an oreo (just kidding).  Really it's
nothing to worry about.  It's one of those things us bus folks just
don't talk about much.
Dave
