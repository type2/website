&gt; ok, i see where i am wrong, i can admit it. i was

&gt; who cares about bay windows anyway?

you SHOULD care about them...  didn't one save 
your ass when you blew your engine?  Thanks

I guess you are lucky you did not run out of 
gas...  I've read that you would rather blow 
an engine than run out of gas.
 
&gt; still, i have not seen a bus-mount &quot;B&quot; case that was
&gt; different than i
&gt; described, and i currently have 3 engines built on
&gt; bus-mount &quot;B&quot; cases.

a bus-snob with bay window powerplants????
