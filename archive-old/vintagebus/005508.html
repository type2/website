There is no '55.  Only the roof section.  The guy has found a roof clip for
sale, (he's not cutting anything)  that he's _thinking_ about putting on a
66 that a PO used to haul lumber on the roof without a roof rack.  We're not
talking about 2 perfectly good (or even close) buses.  He's got to
replace/repair the roof anyway.

&gt; Think about this people.  the guy wants to cut the roof off of a 55 23
window
&gt; and put it on a 66.  why not use the 66 as a donor bus and cut as much
usable
&gt; sheet metal out of it and fix the 55?  the 55 would end up being a cooler
bus
&gt; with nicer bumpers, smaller hatch and at the very least a much better
color
&gt; if painted back to stock.
&gt; And dont tell me about rust (if thats why the 55 is unrestorable).  you
all
&gt; can look at the metwiz's web page and check out my labor of love 58 15
&gt; window.  I have owned that bus for over 10 years and have vowed to fix it
at
&gt; any cost.  it is actually cheeper then you think if you do some of the
work
&gt; yourself.  i think i would rather pull up a cargo floor anyday then to
&gt; replace a roof clip.
&gt;
&gt; Not trying to start a fight,  but why isnt the 55 being saved or given a
&gt; chance?
