Actually, You know it's always like that. You never know where these
buses are. Up where I live I only seen a split once and now I found out
that there are a few guys driving these and live very close to me. I was
in Lincoln only 20 minutes. It took me only 20 minutes to get the bus on
a dolly and take care of the money thing. If I would of known that there
are bus nuts in Lincoln I would of gotten in touch. Next time, traveling
in my bus I'll let everyone know where I'm going. Probably Connecticut to
see my brother? Hey, will see.

Thanks
PS I bought my bus on eBay but I was looking in all the possible places.
