&gt;How much material, and in what area must be removed to fit a 12v flywheel
&gt;into a 6v bell-housing?  thanks, Jim


About 3/16 of an inch (5mm) from the inside edge of the bosses around the
engine mounting bolts.
It's pretty obvious when you look at it, these are the areas that are
closest to the center.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
