Subject: Re: [VB] bus advice

Lets be honest, and break it down abit.  While important, how crucial is it
to have turn signals?  If the bus runs solid, stops even more solid and can
function, I would get the head lights, tailights and brake lights working.
Get the wiring Diagram from Vintagebus_dot_com for it, and try and patch the
wiring that's there first.  Can't take you more than a couple hours even if
you have to run new temporary wires.  Let a lone, ask around and I bet you
find a few bus people in your area who would like to help you out.  I'm in
SD, but if I wasn't I'd be over to help you out.  As for the title, what do
you have right now, and what do you know about the prior registration on it?
Tell us more.

Later,

&gt; Can anybody tell me what they think it might cost at an electricians to
run
&gt; new wiring, and what it takes to get a title. I'm sure I must have to
provide
&gt; more info about the condition of it, so please email me any questions and
&gt; suggestions. This is why I love this list. THANKS FOR ANY HELP. and I will
&gt; try to get some pics up within the next week.
