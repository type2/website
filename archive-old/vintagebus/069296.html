&gt; 
&gt; Or is the pressed in nut broken loose and spinning?

I got a few responces already, which basically said just get under
then and get on it :) Looks like I did not do a proper job describing
the problem, I should have taken pics. I'll try this a bit more
verbose this time.

So on the engine side there is that immovable bushing in place of a
regular nut. This is (I assume) pressed into the case just like on the
SP beetle engine I have on the floor. It is solid &amp; won't budge. Logic
would tell me to crawl under there &amp; just give the bolt head a good
ole try. This is the problem. I must have crawled under/out of the bus
8 times saying &quot;this can't be right&quot;. I can get a wrench on the bolt
however it cannot turn. It's not my feeble arm strength either :) The
transmission case has a raised &quot;V&quot; right next to the bolt. one of the
corners of the bolt head fits in this &quot;V&quot; so that it keeps it from
turning. So basically the neither end of the bolt or nut can turn. 

Not only would I love to get this bolt out, I have no idea how in
bob's name he managed to do this? I have an extra swing axle
transmission on the floor &amp; it has this &quot;V&quot; as well. So this is
apparently how they are built. Very odd though.
