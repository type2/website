hi all,

i had monday off for presidents day ( i think that was the holiday) so i
worked on my bus from 10 to 10 :)

anyhow, i got all the brakes torn down, and really started looking at my
front beam.  I am a bit worried that it is pretty screwed up... here is
what im looking at...

-4 bad bearings
-1 bad spindle (i got a metal shaving in my hand checking it for
smoothness.  It is marginal and i'd try it, but i dont want to get stuck
on side of road over something like that)
-tie rods are both bent and drag link is bent so bad it dented the floor
up!! I think this guy must have really wacked something hard and i
probably have a bent torsion arm if i measured it..
-king pin seals are cracked.  I used some goop to seal the cracks, but if
the rubber is that bad it really should be replaced... thats a lot of work
for a marginal spindle etc.

So... since i have a really nice 67 front beam im thinking of throwing
that in.  the bearings are cheaper, and spare parts are more available,
and it has none of the problems the 61 beam has. (though the drums are
really nice, they probably have 3 turnings left! save those for future
use.)

Anyone think im blaspheming?

I'm not too worried about the brake bias being shifted forward, thats much
better than shifting it rearward... plus my small nut rear end seems
really nice, the drums are well within spec and everything looks good...

anyhow, any input would be helpful.

i also cleaned the rust off the windshields and removed the fugly mirror
arms.  In the process of beating on the drivers side hinge bolt, the
windshield wipers all of a sudden started working.  i think my bus likes
being fixed and is rewarding me :)

Did a bunch of other small stuff and drove to the auto parts store and
back several times.  All in all a fun day.

peas,

Steve
