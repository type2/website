&gt; I said 0 is the beginning of any numbering system. Of course you would

You just did it to yourself. If you were counting years, would you start at
zero? Nope.

&gt;  If we're going by the fact that they started at year 1...

Which is correct for the Gregorian calendar. There is no known calendar that
starts at year zero, with the exception of the astronomical calendar, which
also has negative years, and is used only by astronomers.

&gt;
&gt; then by all means 2001 is the start of the new millennium, but it's
&gt; still in my opinion incorrect.

But this is not really a matter of opinion - this is a matter of facts. Fact
is, you're wrong. By the Gregorian calendar, which is the most commonly used
calendar in the world, and the one used by the United States, the new
millenium does not actually start until January 1, after 2000 years has
already passed.

Still don't believe me? How about the U.S. Naval Observatory Time Service?

highest IQ measured?

Not to belabor a point, but I'm easily annoyed when people refuse to see
reality.
