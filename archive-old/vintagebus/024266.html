Subject: re: sending unit removal

Anyone every had any luck in pulling out a sending unit with out
removing the engine?
Is it possible to test a fuel gauge for continuity to see if it is still

good?

First disconnect the battery.  Then remove all four engine bolts and let
the engine rest down with a jack under it for support.  You can then
completely loosen both gas tank straps, disconnect both wires, and then
you can twist the tank around towards the back of the engine.  It will
be close to the roof and fan shroud but it is able to be done this way.
Also make sure that the tank is real low on fuel so it will be easier to
move around.  Good luck.
