Have the 65 westy- sold in Germany with M codes for US spec, had OG safari 
windows which I removed and sold to someone in Bakersfield,CA who would enjoy 
them 5000% more than I would here in the PNW, repainted the original Velvet 
Green and Blue White 3 years ago now, and still looks good, not bad for a 
first paint job, eh?  Replaced the left rocker at that side, but the right 
rocker is still rusty, and front floor needs patching, and though the dash is 
sweet, the rear interior could stand redoing.  Wheel have hubcaps on one 
side, clips broken on other.  Maybe this summer.... the rest will look nice.  
Put a bunch of miles on this bus- have roof rack, will travel.  

There's the 61 15 window, OG SRW/paint.  Paint's kinda old.  bondo on left 
side nose and behind cargo doors when I got it, and a deer and a ditch 
further dented the nose.  Has pretty much all the deluxe trinkets, original 
interior panels, stylee 8 track stereo big dial, OG safaris ( but have a 
solid one in on the drivers side cause of leaks), gorgeous SWR dash that I 
polished and waxed, comfy hump seat. Rust in rockers, jack points, 
outriggers, front floor bad, doglegs bad, rear taillights cut to 62-71 style. 
 now has rebuild tranny and a motor.  Needs drag link, steering box, will put 
in locking column and NOS white steering lock.  All doors take one key.  Has 
sigla glass, including cracked left corner window.  Bay Z-bed in back, with 
door taken off and bottom piece of wood cut to accomodate the heat log, a 
homemade (not by me) cabinet next to it below the windows, bay SO-44 closet 
behind driver, and a bay westy campstool inside.  Most of the headliner is 
there, except I ripped out the backmost pieace as it had started hangin down 
and bugging me.  Expired tags.   Roof rack.  I really like this bus.  

The 53 standard micro with 95% external surface rust, front floor with no 
rust and has nice paint, small small rust in rockers, small holes behind each 
front wheel well,  no rust in jack point, outriggers, doors, etc.  Small ding 
in nose.  low kilometers, original interior except the middle seat came out 
of another bus, headliner still good (one small tear)  has VDO for VW  6V oil 
temp guage, my first complete through bottom end rebuild -a 36hp on case with 
original motors' # , have owners manual, original shorty no rear bumper 
crank, the air vent that sits above drivers seat (not the Behr kind, no fans, 
does not covers the widows peak) , finally removed the broken off upper left 
shock bolt the other day after copious careful drilling - hours and hours- 
and tapping and now has one new front shock on the right side, though I 
haven't undone the upper left one yet- doing the tap and oil thing for 
ANOTHER week first. Cr%p for heat.  Roof rack factory installed through roof 
before headliner was installed.

these run.
