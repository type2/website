NQ:

I have the same problem on my Baja Bug right now. The boots have the VW logo 
on them and the package stated that they are from Germany. I installed them 
last summer and they are so cracked that they look as though they will split 
open at any moment.

There must have been a run of bad boots shipped over from Germany last year.
