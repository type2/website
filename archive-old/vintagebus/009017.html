well ill be ****ed, i just stepped out to look for a brand name on the
mirror, and the fittings go on the end of the arms, the part that tightens
down is already oxidizing, well anyway there are no markings on them othere
than a stamped date  on the inside of the mirror, and i through out the
boxes , and the invoice doesnt say, so i guess the supplier would have to
answer that,
i will say however that they did tell me about type2_dot_com, which lead me to
you guys , and ive learned more about the bus in the last month than i did
in the last 7 years!


&gt; so that we are talking about the same parts......
&gt;
&gt; what is the brand name or markings,  Taiwan or ?
&gt;
&gt; I am sure there is only  a couple of companies making them,  it would be
nice
&gt; to know which ones are junk..............
