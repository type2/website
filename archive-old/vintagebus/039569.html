Howdy,

Well, I'm looking forward to receiving my CE Safari's but am a bit troubled 
about the wiper shaft disconnects.  The ones pictured with the CE kit are 
the outer style ('65-'67? did they have different wiper arms?).

Looking at the Bentley instructions, they are utilizing an inner style 
disconnect.  I looked through the VintageBus archive and saw questions about 
ruining the springs on the wiper arms with the outer style disconnects, but 
no answers or remedies.  Apparently Wolfgang International sells the earlier 
(inner style) disconnects for $140 a pair.  What do you all suggest?  If in 
fact I do need the inner style disconnects, does someone have a pair, or 
know of good manufacturers of these wiper shafts?

Thank you,

Alex
