Subject: Re: [VB] SAFARIS [`61 Westy For Sale]
Message-ID: &lt;0.1da09738.2554cbec_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i think todds price on the westy and the safaris are justified.
If that 61 was sitting here in cali instead of 1800 miles away It would have 
been sold by now.
As far as the safaris, Ive been looking for a PERFECT set needing nothing but 
instalation for a while now.
Let me know if any sets that are 1K or less needing nothing come up for sale. 
I CERTAINLY cant find anything but garbage as the local shows in california.
Maybe in ohio they are a little easier to come by?

&lt;&lt;Steve,

Don't worry I am not offended......but I am sorry I
feel I have to justify my prices to you (or anyone) as
who really cares?  But see, I am tryin to sell the
bus...and a &quot;GEEE those safaris costs alot! duhhh..&quot;
comment does not do great for my efforts sellin it,
regardless if the wise crack comment is true or
not...make sense?  

But HEY!! I would be interested in buying your safaris
if they are not worth that much to you??...Almost NOS
parts and all! :-)  Give me your price!
