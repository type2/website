&gt;We spent a couple hours in the carb yesterday cleaning and blowing carb
&gt;cleaner and fart in a can through every possible orifice (in the carb, the
&gt;carb I tell you!) until it was so clean.

My Dad's '74 Bug sat for a couple of years before we got it running again.
The 34 PICT 3 was pretty gunked up and it took a couple of overnight soaks
in the carb cleaner can to get it really clean and running right.  The side
of the can says something about two or three hours, but overnight works
better.  Blowing it out with air after it comes out of the can works well.

&gt;Funny thing, those brown opaque floats don't have any real evident way to
&gt;adjust fuel level in the bowl.

I was under the impression that that was handled by the little washers or
shims that go under the float valve.  All the carb kits I've seen usually
have several thicknesses of these, like an 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and a 1.5 mm.  I
think a thicker washer puts the pintle closer to the float and makes it
close sooner for a lower fuel level.

&gt;Any ideas?  I've run out.

Fresh gas?  If it's the same stuff that's been sitting in the tank for
a year, don't try to save it - get some fresh gas.

Vacuum leak?  Probably something like a hose or DP manifold boot that
broke or fell off, not something gradual like a throttle shaft, since
it seemed to &quot;break&quot; suddenly.

What happens if you take off the gas cap?  If the tank venting is plugged
up, something like this can happen.  However, if this was the problem, I
think it'd be more likely that you'd get no fuel at all after a few minutes
of running - blipping the throttle wouldn't work.
