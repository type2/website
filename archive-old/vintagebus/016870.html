Hello everyone,

I was out at the pick and pull a couple of days ago, checked out the tag on 
the vent box from a splitty I was getting parts off of, and I realized that 
it was a '65 hardtop standard.  The wiper shafts, motor and linkages are all 
there.  Wasn't someone looking for those awhile ago?  Isn't '65 a one year 
thing?  I could go and get them next time if someone wants them.  I didn't 
check to see if they turned still, but they looked alright from the outside.

Mike Anderson
'64 SO-35

p.s.  I may have stumbled into some flipseat interior pieces!  I will post 
if it pans out ...  No they will not be for sale.
