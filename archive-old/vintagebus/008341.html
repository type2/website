Subject: Caravan to Spring Meet Puyallup this Sat
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2001 10:51:25 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi All,
I'm planning on driving up to the Spring Meet this weekend in Puyallup,
Washington and want to extend an invitation to anyone who wants to caravan.
I'll be leaving on Friday from Sacramento area about 1:00pm and driving to
Grants Pass, Oregon to stay the night. Then I'll be leaving Grants Pass
about 6:00 am and stopping in Corvallis, Oregon at the Arco station at the
hwy 34 EXIT 228 to meet up with  some Wet Westies at about 8:30 am. Then
just north of Portland we'll stop between noon and 1:00pm to meet some
others at the Janzen Beach exit and meeting in the Safeway parking lot.
I'll be driving a 71 Black and White Westy and monitoring CB ch. 17 and
Motorola Talk about ch 2. The more the better and we'll drive at whatever
speed is best for the masses.
