I used to work for AAA and I can tell you the official answer. No.  However,
sometimes you can smooth talk them into bringing a car home because the cost
of repair at said shop is to much.  This will work if AAA didn't bring the
car to the shop in the first place.  AAA has a &quot;one tow per breakdown&quot; rule.
I know what y'all conniving people are saying and believe me I have heard it
all.  There wasn't a day that went by that someone wasn't trying to pull a
fast one.  In all actuality, I didn't care but the tow truck drivers only
make about $5 per tow.  If they can get regular tow charges they will.  Is
the car at a body shop or repair shop?  Is it complete?  If doesn't have a
motor then AAA won't tow it.  The intent of AAA is &quot;emergency&quot; roadside
assistance.  It's not there to tow cars from shop to shop then back home
again.  If the car is complete you could try pushing it out on the street
and then tell AAA that it just broke down right there.  I've heard that one
before and since it was generally against AAA policy to tell someone that
they are full of $h!t we would cover it.  Good luck and remember to be nice.
If someone was an ass to me I would stick to my guns and follow the rules to
the T.

Anyone have any luck using their AAA plan to move a project car around, ie
bring one home from a shop?
