Someone sent me some fantastic pictures of an engine test/rebuild stand.  The 
stand utilizied the part of the clutch houseing that has the starter holes 
and pressure plate lever.  What is the difference in the size off this part 
&gt;from year to year?  I can't bolt a 36hp on the same one that I could a 
pancake motor???

AFAIK you can.  Since I have bolted a 1600 into a split case tranny (buildt 
for 36hp) and you can put a upright in a pancake bus I believe you can use 
the same piece of flywheel to test start anything 25hp through pancake.   I 
have such a piece of a tranny, and switch starter bushing/starter to match 
the 6V or 12V FW.  Also useful as a starter test item.  Mine is just a piece 
of bell housing, not a stand.
