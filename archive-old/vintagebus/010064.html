I am looking for a prop rod for an engine lid for a 60 single cab. (Cargo
door prop rod is the same as engine lid)

When I had to remove my front shift rod coupler on my pickup, I tried
everything: heat, cold, oils, pickle forks, hammering. I finally gave up
trying to save the coupler and used a 9 inch grinder to slice a groove into
it from the front to back. This split the coupler open without damaging the
rods.

When putting it back together, I learned the plastic bushings (badminton
birdie looking things) can actually be changed with the rod installed and
the trans in place. If you remove the front rod, the rear rod can be slid
forward all the way to the front of the bus, which just allows the rear
bushing to come out of the tube. The bushing is split, with plastic dowel
molded into it, and it can be slipped over the shift rod. Don't force the
bushing back into the tube, or you will shear the plastic dowel off. The
open ends of the birdie face the center of the bus, so front bushing faces
rearward, and rear bushing faces front. 

I would like to add a reverse lamp to my truck, too. Electrical is no
problem, but I would like to find a vintage looking lamp housing that would
clamp to the rear overrider or bolt to the bumper (something I could flash
tailgaters with, hmm, how about a million candle power light cannon? Now
that's gotta be illegal!). Any one know of a good source?	

What is supposed to go between the heat exchanger and the cherry bomb
silencer thing on the heat tube? My truck came with no engine, just sand
filled silencers. I had to remove the silencers and gut them, cuz there's no
way I wanted that s**t blowing into the cab. Is the felt packing available?
Has there ever been a replacement asbestos jacket made for the heat tube?

Has there ever been a replacement doughnut for under the gas tank? Or the
little felt pads that go under the tank straps?

Does any one make the brake line hold down clamps?

Took the truck around the block with the wife on Saturday. First run under
it's own power in about 20 years. Went about 6 blocks and got 6 waves. This
is going to be great.  2-1\2 years and many thousands later, I'm due for
some fun.
