&gt; Thanks for the tip, but get this all. The guy selling this particular 
sunroof

too 
&gt; much interest in the bus before he saw it, which is where he messed up, but 
&gt; it is just mesed up that people would take advantage of other people like 
&gt; that. At least there are far fewer people like this in teh VW community 
than 

I wouldn't be so sure about that - there are tons of stories just like that.
It's *VERY* common to pull all the choice parts off the car, then offer to
&quot;locate&quot; said parts for the buyer, in effect, getting more for the car than
they could have if it was all in once piece to start with.

yes, unfortunately.  Found a barndoor in the woods with the &quot;nice bits&quot; taken 
off- including the roof, so this means that after winters here it was very 
rusty with alders starting through the front floor.      ANd I heard that it 
had been quite a decent standard micro.   Sort of a double edged sword, you 
know.   I hope people will try to save a bus they find, or pass it on to 
someone who will, but there are people who dont care.   I had a 60 SC that 
had no lower bed, rockrs bad etc, I didn't want to put it back together, and 
a couple people were inerested to cut out the rear corners and the extremely 
straight nose.   Found a guy who reassembled it (motors brakes etc)- and was 
happy, cause I wasn't going to do it.  I got the truck cheep cause the guy 
who had it was getting flak from his Mom for too many dead VWs.  Could have 
been sent to the junk yard.  But we do need spare bits for our buses, they 
have to come from somewhere, some bits are no reproed or easier/better to 
find OG.  I hope when I get something  that it wasn't sold to me cause the 
sum of the parts was worth more than the whole.   But at Kelley Park a couple 
years ago I had people trying to buy parts off the bus I had driven 800+ 
miles to get there-  yes my 61 15 window is ratty abd has severe rocker rust 
and faded original paint and dents at the bottom of the nose but it has all 
the original bits (some I had to find, like one corner jailbar, and a horn 
button, and ash trays and a radio block off and rear deluxe bumper and a 
safari pivot and) and original safaris.   No I was not selling the bits of my 
bus, I didn't bring it to part it out.   No you can't get the trim off the 
vents. 

  And  I wonder when I heard a bus is being parted out- is it that bad, or 
just worth more as parts?
