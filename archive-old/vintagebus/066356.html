Subject: RE: [T2] Chinese Tires

  I have been using Taiwan/China tires for years. It seems that more and
more are coming in this country all the time. NanKing seem to have been the
first. I got over 40,000 miles out of a set before 1 seperated. Nice, quiet.
  I now have some ChingHaugh, which handle good but are real noisey.
   On my F#_at_d tow truck I have Kumho which are great tires. They seem to be
an up and coming tire in the U S. and a lot of the water pumper crowd are
using their performance tires.		
   On another note, my local tire supplier has 6.70/15 bias 6 ply tires in
stock now. Wasn't this the original size tire on a pr 64 bus?

Seen on clients Vanagon, but also good specs for T-II.

JING LUNG
Made in China
Beijing Tyre Factory
(US/Canada Mkt)
185R14C
1872 lbs _at_ 65 psi cold
Load Range D
102/100N
8PR
Radial Tubeless

Cursory observations yeild no apparent fault or blemish.

Nice tread design looking like good for mud/snow. Client reports no road 
noise issues. Not sure which vendor he got these at but they were special 
order. If you can leave the politics out of it, it sure looks like the best 
of specs for a loaded Westy or fully loaded delivery Kombi. Time will tell 
how they wear.

So, anyone know Chinese?? Does &quot;JING LUNG&quot; translate to &quot;Road Master&quot; or 
&quot;Buried in the mud for 300 years&quot; or what??????
