Thanks for the suggestions. I was interested in cleaning the fan and fins with the engine in place as periodic maintenance or after a dusty stretch. The bug sprayer with Simple Green or a citrus degreaser sounds like the deal. 

Nonvintage question: The DC has a bay beam with power assist brakes working off the vacuum under dual dellortos. It has a check valve ahead of the engine. Could, or should, I plumb the breather box to the intake manifolds? Is there a vacuum switch that opens when the dumb driver uses the engine for braking? 

A tip for the coin-op places and getting hot water. The newer ones usually still have hot water. Go when it's not busy, use the stall near the equipment room. Take your own brush, you don't know where theirs have been. Take your own towels or chamois. If the coin slot is above a drain grate you can find fistfuls of quarters if you don't mind digging in muck. 

There's a detailed article in the latest HVW on Dana Nye's DC. They admit to cronyism!
