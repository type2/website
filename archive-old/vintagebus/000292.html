 Hi Volks,
 Our bus parts manual up to 1967 and our 1968-about 74 bus shop manual both 
 have the same part number... &gt;&gt;

The Bay window tilt I am currently running on '58 is cab height.  (Yes, it is 
a little long but not too bad.)  I have been told this is a Brazilian Bay 
tilt.  It has a venetian blind style rear window/door/piece to it.  Maybe the 
difference in height (cab height vs. cab height+1') has to do with country of 
origin?
