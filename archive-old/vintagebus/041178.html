I use the cheapest gas I can find in my part of California (so I guess
that means I use the expensive gas). My engine is brand spanky new /
just under 1000miles / doesn't even leak oil yet 1600dp. Sure it has
more power on high octane, and I bet it would run dynamite on racing
fuel. And if it were a high performance auto and not an economy van I
might consider that.

My last car got 40mpg and so I don't know and don't want to know the
mpg of the bus. But could I comfortably sleep in the old car? No! Was
it stand out funky and a pride to drive? No! Was it a vintage bus? No!
(It is a 1983 D_at_dge Colt, a rockin' little car in her own right, but
you don't want to drive it any more than I do...)
