I decided to register my bus finally on the vintagebus_dot_com bus registry. I
was looking through the model numbers and comparing it with mine. it skipped
236 and went straight to 237. 235 is a LHD Right side cargo door with a
sunroof, which sounds very close to what I have, since it has a hole in the
roof for the Dormobile top.

Also isn't there an Mcode decoder in the site somewhere? I couldn't find it.
TIA,
casey
