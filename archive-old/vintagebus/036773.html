&lt;&lt; I have decided to sand it all off and start over.  It will be less work to
go in with 200-400 grid paper and reshoot it then to go over the whole bus
with 1500-2000
 paper and buff it out.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Matthew,
Well the factory color paint was not only one coat, but four and it would not
hurt you to paint a few thin coats paint with sanding between.  This prevents
the unsightly rock chips to show so well when only one coat of paint is used
and helps to keep the rust from getting through and under the paint layers.
Found this out when my stepfather repainted our 1961 bug.  First he sanded the
original paint to rough it up so when next coat would stick.  Then he fillered
primered the black bug with a light gray color.  Followed with a black coat of
urethane paint.  Every time the bug had a rock chip the light gray filler
primer showed oh so brightly compared to the black.  On the bus the front nose
and lower sides are especially prone to rock chips.  These are closely
followed by the roof section due to both rock chips and sun damage.
