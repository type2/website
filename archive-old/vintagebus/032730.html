 Kelly,  I've heard good things about you and your work.  It's not that I 
mind 
 selling busses to individuals who are going to care for them;  it's the 
 people who come out to New Mexico to scrounge up all the restorable stuff to 
 sell back east at a profit, to the detriment of those of us here who love 
 busses, and want to continue working on our own projects.  I've got enough 
 projects to last a little while, but I'd rather sell some of the things I've 
 collected to the people who want to get them going for themselves, not to 
the 
 profiteers or speculators.  I own property in downtown Albuquerque that's 
 worth about 7 to 9 times what I paid for it a little more than a decade ago, 
 but I bought the place to live in, not to make some absurd profit.  I'd be 
  &gt;&gt;
re making money off VW stuff.  I went on road trips  and junkyarded.  came 
back to the PNW  with the bus heavily weighted down.  Took pieces of buses, 
now the locals there can't find them.  BUt you know, the only reason I found 
stuff was that the junkyards rarely crushed cars, out in the bonnie boonies, 
unlike in urban areas where property crunch blablabla,   THese buses had been 
in place for decades.,  Some even had front emblems.  Rear bumpers.  middle 
seats.  Sunroofs.  deluxe trim.  etc   I dont think the locals were looking 
for old bus parts, or they wouldn't be on the cars.   In fact, VW folks we 
met were happy to show us parts cars and junkyards and trade for stuff we'd 
piled on the bus (here's an old style brake light decklid, trade you for that 
barndoor front door, heres some nice windsheilds, etc)    People were very 
happy to buy stuff at the local swaps here. I wish I could have hauled some 
buses back, including a nice straight rust free 55 DD panel VIN- 20-124 xxx.  
A few have been saved.  But  most of those junkyards have been crushed out 
since then.  So what's the harm?  It paid for a road trip, drive through 
crazy back roads and mountains in an old bus, actually finding parts for the 
61 on the way.    
=  = === = 

glad to sell one of my busses at a loss to somebody who'd love it and care 
for it.  This is a hobby for most of us, and that's what's important to me.  
You and Ronnie in Havasu and others make a living off busses and parts, but I 
don't see you out here taking possible projects out of our area.  Your 
business, and Ronnie's, is to provide a service to those people who are 
loving and restoring our wonderful vehicles.

actually Ronnie sends dry AZ doors to England, where people want them to put 
on instead of their rusted doors.  Sends them in a bay window.  I saw years 
ago, before list, at a swap in England a bunch of not rusty doors they said 
they imported from CA or AZ.  it's has been going on a long time (dunno who 
was sending them then) but evidently there is a steady stream of VW doors out 
of the SW.  I am sure the English enjoy them.

I know someone who collected oval window bugs years ago when he could pick 
them up for a couple hundred bucks.   Put them in his Dad's barn.  20 years 
later he sold them.   If you want to have loads of projects, that's what you 
need to do,   There are buses I thought I would go get later, that were gone 
when I got around to it. Dunno what happened to them.    Just get a big barn. 

The Americans go over to Europe to find the wierd old widgets we cant find 
here and bring them back. VW barely sold any 25hp stuff here (53 and 
earlier).  there they sold it for years and years.

And people bring back the fire trucks, hearses old barndoors, etc

I think people are a bit NIMBY, dont take the buses away from my town.   In 
fact, bring lots of them here so I can see people drive around in old VWs.   
Ya.   

Clara
