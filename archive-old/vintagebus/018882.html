Subject: Re: [VB] Random orbit sanders?
In-Reply-To: &lt;3A5A2BFC.6030107_at_supernet_dot_net&gt; from Joe Clark at &quot;Jan 8, 2001  4: 7: 8 pm&quot;

There are several options.  Harbor Freight has a round oribital
sander that actualy works &quot;ok&quot; and it's only ~$50 or so.  If you
want the real deal, step up to a National Detroit, but that will
run you ~200-250.

The straight &quot;spin&quot; sanders don't work well for this kind of operation, as
they take the material off way too fast, even with fine paper.

There are &quot;dual-action&quot; sanders, with a locking collet to function
as a spin sander, or let the collet rotate freely and it works as
an orbital .  The HF version of this one is poor, but maybe that's cause I
have the National Detroit version of it and know better!

&gt; recommendations on an air-powered one (especially one that I can get at 
&gt; Lowe's and use up my Xmas gift card) would be appreciated.
