Subject: Raffle Bus, TWWM!

Wooohoooo!! Watch those 50 cent raffle tickets!! Just got back from visiting Arizonabusclub_dot_com and got a good look at the uncle who appears to have been doing a little wrench bending on that raffle bus, and he's the worlds worst mechanic. Hey Jerry, what you doing with that back belt on? You were not dead lifting that beetle motor into that bus all by yourselve? They gonna change the exhaust on that thing? 

 Chuck
P.S. Jerry, I hope you got some sun screen on in that Aridzona sun.
