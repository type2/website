Subject: Got 'em home...what a trip!!!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I finally went &amp; got my 2 new buses over the last week. Got the '62
23-window deluxe last Thursday. Used a U-haul tow dolly to pull it. It has
no transaxle, so I put a home-made &quot;rear-end dolly&quot; on the back. I put the
back-end on the tow dolly &amp; tied down the steering wheel. It was a 3 1/2
drive &amp; it went great. No problems at all.

So yesterday I went to get the '66 standard &quot;parts-bus&quot;. Things went a
little different this time. It also had no transaxle installed (It's inside
the cargo area of the bus) so I once again used the rear-end dolly. The bus
was also loaded down with all kinds of junk. So it was much heavier than
the '62 was. I changed out the front tires, &amp; tied down the steering wheel
with the rear-end once again on the U'haul tow dolly. Got about 15 miles
down the road when...BAM. The '66 had a blow-out on the drivers-side wheel
that was on the ground. No problem. I'm prepared. I changed it out with
another tire &amp; was on the road again. About 3 minutes down the road, the
'66 started fish-tailing REALLY bad. I immediatly pulled over. When I went
to check what had happened, I saw that the nut &amp; fixtures that held the
front passenger drum on had come off!!! By chance, the wheel was still
there with the suspension poking through the middle. To make a long story
short, I rigged the hub into place, pushed the van off the dolly, &amp; put it
on the other direction. What a nightmare. I drove 45 all the way home for
fear that the little wheels on my rear-end dolly would blow.

You can see pictures of the '62 23-window &amp; the home-made rear-end dolly
posted on my site. I'll also be putting pictures of the '66 parts van as
well as the other T2's this guy has for sale up in the next couple of days.
He's got a rolling 21-window shell &amp; a few others. He's also got some
various parts lying around. He's in Lubbock, Tx.
