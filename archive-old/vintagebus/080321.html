Subject: Re: [VB] front spindle nut

Hi Labmission,
The inner nut we set to the proper looseness from the wheel bearing and  
drum.  Install the metal lock plate, and bend the tab to secure the inner  nut.  
Followed by spinning on the outer nut and using the cresent to  snug it against 
the lock tab and inner nut while keeping a visual on the  inner nut to make 
sure it does not move.  Bend lock tab to secure the outer  nut.
  If you feel you need a thin wrench for the inner nut you will  either have 
to buy one or can easily make one out of  1/8&quot; sheet steel with  a drill, 
hacksaw, and file.
