Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] Painting Engine Cases

&lt;&lt;Following Bob Hoover's advice, I used an industrial grade satin black
cut 50 - 50
with benzene. &gt;&gt;

Cut it with benzene??!! Why not just regular paint thinner? If I am not
mistaken, benzene is one of the most potent carcinogens known, isn't it?
As a general rule, I try to stay away from or limit my exposure to any
substance that evaporates as quickly as benzene does.
