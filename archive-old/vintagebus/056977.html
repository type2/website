Subject: Re: [VB] Infrared Powder Coating?

I had my rims (stock 15&quot;)powdercoated in '98 and have
never had a problem with them.

&gt; I asked the only guy here in Marysville what size
&gt; oven he has and he said he 
&gt; dont, He used infrared.  He does everything up to
&gt; car chassis with it. Does 
&gt; anyone know if this is as good?  My guess is melting
&gt; the stuff is melting 
&gt; the stuff.  I am going to do the crewcab engine tin
&gt; as well as the 36hp tin 
&gt; at about $10 a piece he said.  I also took the
&gt; opportunity to ask him if he 
&gt; could do wheels since someone on the list said you
&gt; cant cause the 400 
&gt; degrees makes you loose the temper...  He said he
&gt; does wheels all the time 
&gt; .. $25 each.
&gt; 
&gt; He also said to bring in bare metal, no zinc
&gt; coating.  Sound right?
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him about doing the muffler in powder coat
&gt; and he suggested Jett 
&gt; Hott coating due to the 400 degree break.  But I
&gt; guess this only comes in 
&gt; silver/aluminum color.  I have an original 36hp
&gt; Abarth, and I think they 
&gt; were originally flat black so thats a no go.  TIA
