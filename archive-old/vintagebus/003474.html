Subject: 67 Half Cab PU for sale

I'm a vanagon person but an acquaintance here in Annapolis is offering his
67 half cab pickup for sale.  I took a quick look at it yesterday and it
seems a bit rough for the $4000 that he wants.  He says the drive train is
all good.  The rear bumber is missing, but otherwise it all seems to be
there.  There is a lot of rust but mostly not completeley rusted through..
I guess you might call it advanced surface rust.  Anyway, His name is Mark
Hall and can be reached at 410-263-4752  or fax at 410-263-4788.  This is in
Annapolis, Md...a short hop from the nation's capital.
