Subject: On the road

We replaced the pulley on the generator with a type 3 6 volt generator
pulley.  We now have a 2.1:1 ratio.  SOme concern about speed on the fan
and generator but a run last night looked good.  It was 77 deg (thank
you City of Victorville sign) and even the haul up the back of cajon
pass resulted in temps of 215 tops.

So we are on the road this morning.  Leaving now for Laughlin today,
then if system holds it is on to Denver for a couple weeks, South Lake
Tahoe for a couple more (with side trips to Hot August Night), and then
the San Francisco Bay area for a couple.  So if you see the 59 ddr
camper in racing primer gray and sporting a newly painted white rear
bumper headed down the road in the slow lane wave &amp; say hi.

We will try to let you know how it goes down the road on this journey.
(Hopefully not via AIRS)
