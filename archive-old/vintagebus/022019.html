&lt;&lt; I really don't think that I have to worry about rust as, I'm in Las Vegas
and
 we rarely get even a measurable amount of precipitation.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Unless you are running without good window seals and sealant or with your
sunroof open all the time weather precipitation is not a major factor for rust
inside the upper walls and ceiling of the bus.  Here in the Pacific NW we have
plenty of precipitation and our buses are fine in these areas!  Instead it is
a matter that your lungs are expelling water vapor and this makes it's way
into areas of the bus that are colder and condense there.  A while back this
list conversation started up and later a gal p-mailed us to thank us for
metioning condensation problems and the result with materials that held water
against the sheet metal.  She had gone to her bus which she had install foam
rubber over the engine compartment about a half year before.  Low and behold
she found rust starting and she lived in San Diego California area!  So if you
local weather gets below 60F you are going to have problems.  Even if you are
planning to cut a hole in your roof and install a snorkle system for you and
each of your passengers to breath through and keep the lung vapor out of your
bus.   Without your breathing, the moisture still has a tendency to make it's
way into the well sealed VW and build up over time.  This is why VW
reccomendeds that during long indoor storage it was a good idea to leave the
windows cracked open.  Ask anyone who has owned a type 3 K. Ghia and they will
tell you even in a heated garage they rust due to both the body not being zinc
primered dipped at the factory and moisture condensation gets a good rust foot
hold in them.

PS We still have the 1963 panel that was converted into a camper and had foam
rubber installed as insulation in the ceiling.  The moisture collected in this
material rusting the entire inside of the roof where it touched and flowed
down to the lower edges resulting in rust through the roof just above the rain
gutter all around the rear 3/4 of the bus.  While over the front passenger and
driver seat the inside of the roof is pristine due to no foam rubber up front.
Otherwise there is no rust in the bus until you get down to the rockers.
