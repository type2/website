&lt;&lt; A good home? Sean Seitz won second in the chili contest at last years
Havasu
 show, I think, by opening a can of Hormel chili and sticking a spoon in.
 Didn't even heat it. I ask you, is this the kind of home you would want for
 your single cab? &gt;&gt;

That says alot for Sean, if he can get over on the judges like that, that
