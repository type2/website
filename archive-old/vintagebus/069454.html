Subject: Ich bin ein Weldor

Test drove the new MIG tonight and had fun making really messy welds on
some metal bits lying around the shop.  I could feel the wire bumping the
work, which I guess means the feed is too fast -- but a few times I got a
nice frying-bacon sound and man are those pieces welded together.  Far
out.

I'm gonna play with it a little more tomorrow and then weld the guide-tube
tab back to the torsion tube housing.  I went ahead and removed the gas
tank tonight.  Felts are pretty tired - what alternatives have people used
to replace them?  Otherwise it was not a big deal.  Looks like getting the
filler neck seal back in place will be the biggest hassle when
reinstalling.

I also R&amp;Red the shift rod bushings and bellows.  Actually I just reused
the shuttlecock bushes because they looked OK and the %$#_at_! repro bushes
just don't fit as well - the casting line goes right through the pin,
making it out of round.  New bellows are very nice - I remember looking
for some for my other bus just a few years ago and they were not available
then.  Nice to have now, thanks to Wolfsburgwest.

I did go ahead and replace the front rod bush, after taking some time to
remove the rear shifter plate bolt, which had siezed up and been rounded
off by a DPO!  How did they adjust the shifter?  Ended up having to cut
off the bolt head with the dremel; got the rod out and put some heat on
the remaining threads and it came right out.
