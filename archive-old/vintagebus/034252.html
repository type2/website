Eric and I had a chat today where he referenced his &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; 1966
book and he found references to a 4.43 R&amp;P gear.  It also didn't say which
years they used .89 and .82 4th...

Well, this pretty much blows away any ability to be SURE what you have by
turning the crank and counting wheel turns.  4.375 - 4.43 - 4.57 are all so
close on the R&amp;P that you can't be sure.  I have the latest numbers up at:

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/tech/Trans/T2/

I would really like any input on what we think the original 1966 / 1967
Westy came with in terms of R&amp;P and 4th gear.  So far .82 and 4.375 is
current assumption, but I have only tested 2 VW's!  And I could be making
mistakes on the test (don't think so, but...)

My desire is to combine the R&amp;P and 4th gear numbers to validate the 4040RPM
at 65MPH figure that the 1963-1967 Bentley says....

I wanted to get some opinions from those of you who have studied multiple
books and 

Ronnie and I have discussed how VW did change the transaxle at times... for
example, a westy my have been delivered with different gearing than a single
cab or passenger bus.

Anyway -- What I believe I have as a reference is a 1966 Westy Transaxle.
My turning of the crank and measuring wheel turns reveals numbers that
closely match:

   4th Gear is .82
   R&amp;P is 4.375

Does this sound correct for a 1966?  Was there any change in 1967?
