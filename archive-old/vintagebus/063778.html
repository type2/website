Subject: Be Prepared/ The Road to BNNTA

I'm leaving for BNNTA soon and followed the sage advice of several on
the list about those little 35-year-old bugs (TM) that will get you if
you let them.  Instead, I:

Set tire pressure (all 5 and glad)
topped off the oil
added distilled water to battery
topped off transmission lube
filled window washer &amp; cleaned the squirter
set valves
checked head torque

Packed extra:
Dizzy
fuel pump (&amp; gaskets)
gasket set
tube patch set
brake cleaner
carb cleaner
oil
gear lube
hand cleaner
rags
almost enough tools to rebuild engine
jack/jack stand
breaker bar

a few things for camping

and, oh, my lady

About 400 mile trip for me.  Slow and easy.
