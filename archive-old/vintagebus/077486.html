Subject: RE: [VB] Battery hold down

I have a stack of 6v tops in various sizes that I can bring to the BBB show
if someone needs one.  If they are priced at $5-$20 then mention this email
for the $5 price.

I have a neat one with a dealer &quot;Battery checked on xx/xx/xx&quot; sticker too,
that one is in the private stash.  Is it weird that I bought a cover I didn't
need just to get the sticker?  :)
