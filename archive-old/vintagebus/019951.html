Subject: Re: [VB] help with magneto

why not search the u.s. patent office's web site?  http://www_dot_uspto_dot_gov/  it might not give you exact application (industrial motor vs. kubelwagen) but i'm sure you'd get something useful.  at my day job i'm a cataloging librarian but not a reference librarian.  i can do limited research but poor social skills and odd interpersonal behaviors prevent me from being allowed to socialize with others.  what that means is i can find it most of the time but i can't show you how to use it.  good luck!
