Hi Dave,
Try replacing the fuel shut off float in the carb with another.  We had a bad 
problem of fuel leaking out the throttle butterfly shaft ends after shut down 
and turned out the otherwise fine looking float was just too heavy.  Did you 
put in a gasket between the float needle valve and the carb top?  What jetting 
are you running?  Could be too big of main jet and/or too small of air 
correction jet.
