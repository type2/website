Subject: front window dismantle

--part1_aa.8326274.29c4db6d_boundary

I asked a buddy of mine a couple of days ago how to properly tear down my 
front window frames and prep them for paint and new seals.  His phone call 
detailed it all clearly but left me still struggling a little.  Is there or 
can someone let me know where to find a detailed tear down procedure in 
writing , such as removing glass.  If I can print a copy it can sit right 
beside me as I tear them down. The entire frame is off the vehicle and I am 
about to start the process on my dining room table.  Thank God the wifes out 
of town.......
