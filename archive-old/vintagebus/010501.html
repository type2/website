&gt; they told me that they
&gt; re-dyed them instead.  They turned the original crusty

&gt; that look like new, and match the new TMI vinyl
&gt; headliner that went in.  So you may want to look into
&gt; having it dyed.

An ex colleague of mine restored a late fifties 4x4 chevy  truck and he had
all the vinyl including the headliner and upholstery redyed/painted. It
looks very good and has been on for 5 or 6 years with no signs of coming
off.

To stretch this post into a full blown friday topic - the truck was imported
into South Africa from Canada and came complete with a snow plow! While we
do get snow once in a while in some parts of the country it is by no means
an annual occurence so his plow equipped truck is pretty unique.

Later
