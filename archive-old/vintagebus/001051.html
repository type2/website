	OK, back to our story, when we last left our brave adventurer, I believe he
was sawing logs in the fine southern mansion of his mothers...

	Wednesday morning I dragged myself outta bed at about 8:30.  Mom had a
big-ole mom type breakfast made, and I dined on REAL flapjacks and bacon an'
stuff for the first time in about  3 or 4 years at least.  My sisters had
already left for school, so it was just me and my mom, and the dog following
me all over the house whining.  Plans for the day were to visit the NASA
Rocket and Space-Camp center in Huntsville, about 2 miles away from the
house.

	The Rocket Center was a worth-while trip.  Being there on a weekday, it
wasn't very crowded and it was a great sunny day to be there as well!  For a
mere 14 bucks, you get to see an IMAX movie about the space program, go on
some rides in the museum, and take a bus tour of the Red Stone Arsenal where
the new ISS is being built, and the original Mercury and Saturn rocket
engines were all test fired. They have on display there the real-deal Apollo
16 capsule, a Mercury and Gemini Capsule, and an entire Saturn-V moon rocket
complete with LM, Command Module, and capsule laid out on its side so you
can walk down the length of it.  A life-size mock-up of Skylab is there, a
few lunar buggies, a lunar-lander, and some Russian stuff thrown in for good
measure.  They also have an entire Space Shuttle, with Main fuel tank, and
booster rockets set up outside... The &quot;Pathfinder&quot; I think it is...  this
shuttle never flew into space, but was used to test the gliding, landing and
re-entry procedures for the vehicle.  IMPRESSIVE...

The bus tour to the Red Stone Arsenal was awesome.  We got to go into the
facility where the International Space Station is currently under
construction.  They take you up to an observation deck, where in one room we
watched'em building part of the main truss assembly, and in a GIGANTIC
clean-room facility, where they are building one of the docking segments of
the station.  This is the 2nd docking segment to be built (the 1st went up
last summer remember?).  In this room, which is about the size of 2 football
fields, and 3 or four (maybe more) stories tall, is a completely dust and
germ-free environment.  The workers were suits and gloves while working on
the ISS, and when it's shipped to Florida, they pack the whole section in an
air-tight container! If the structure is touched by bare skin, it has to be
washed down with alcohol, or that area would severely corrode in exposure to
space. It also has to be COMPLETLEY dust-free, otherwise when weightless,
the dust would float around and get in the astronauts eyes (much like sand
&gt;from the heat ducts in 35 year old Kombis from New Mexico, when you turn on
the heat in Missouri), and foul up the instruments.  You also get to see the
stand where the giant Saturn-V rocket engines were test fired.  They say the
vibrations were so severe the 1st time they lit off all 5 engines at the
same time, it shook the windows out of the new city-hall 30 miles away!!
AND you get to see the test stand where the 1st Mercury rockets where
tested.  The stand and observation bunker were built out of scrap iron, and
old tanks donated by the rail-road... and it LOOKS like it was built from
scrap too! Zoiks!

I saw 2 busses parked in the lots at the Arsenal..  a water-cooled Westy
Vanagon with bike racks and a kyak or something tied to the pop-top, and an
early Bay-Window Estate wagon, which looked pretty darned clean.

All I have to say about the 1st astronauts of the Mercury-Apollo eras is
that they must have had gonads the size of Busses.  I almost wet my pants
just standing next to those rockets! These capsules are no bigger than the
front half of a Beetle, and (I SWEAR I am not making this up) look like
something you could build out of junk from the clearance table at Radio
Shack.  And they're siting on top of what basically amounts to a gigantic
bomb with a nozzle on the bottom. Don't let Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13' movie
fool you.  In this photographers opinion, it was a mistake to have filmed it
in Cinemascope 1:1.43 aspect ratio...  depth and spaces are exaggerated too
much.  Next time you watch that movie, imagine the space inside the capsules
as being about 1/3 as small as they appear on screen.  That's all I have to
say about that.

After the Space Center tour, it was time to head back to mom's house... just
in time to pack back up and go with my sister Rachel to her horse-riding
lessons.  Rachel is big into English-Style riding...  you should see her
room...  ribbons from wall to wall! (yes, I'm bragging about my little sis'
;-) ).  She does the hurdle-jumping thing for which there is a proper name
for but I can't remember it right now. Rachel has her own horse named Tardy,
(makes me think of the VanHalen video.. &quot;I don't feel tardy...  lol) but he
had a loose shoe and she couldn't ride him that day... They set her up on a
'sway-back old bone' as she called him, instead.  Rachel was pretty upset
over it, because it seems like every time somebody comes in from out of
town, Tardy is hurt or un-rideable in some way, and no one can ever see her
ride her own horse!

While that was going on, my mom took me on a little tour of the 'Main Drag'
in Huntsville.  It was there that I saw about 3 Ghias, 4 or five really nice
Bugs, about 3 late-model busses, all pop-top Westies, and at a tire shop, I
caught the back end of a Mint-Green over Dark-Green late 50's ish Kombi. I
couldn't believe all the air-cooled VW's I was seeing!  And then, the
grandest sight of all.. there on the side of the strip, in a pukish
lime-green motif, with a broken neon sign, was a little restaurant,  named
&quot;BANDITO BURRITO&quot;!!!! I absolutely freaked!  This was wonderful!   The stuff
bus road-trippers dreams are made of.  The kinda place where you buy one of
them greasy chili burritos all peppered up and stuff that'll lay you up in
the hospital for a week! If it weren't for my mom, I would have stopped
right then and there, but she would have nothing to do with the joint.  My
sister Gwen though, said that it's quite a popular hang-out and she and her
friends from high school go there quite often.  Darn...  I'll have to plan a
special trip back to Huntsville now just so I can eat at BANDITO BURRITO.. I
just like saying the name! Hahahahaa!!

Back home after the ridding lessons, Gwen had finally gotten home from
hanging' with her friends and going to a few softball games or something
after school, and we sat and ate dinner, and caught up.  I haven't lived
with my mom since before Gwen and Rachel were even in school.   I feel like
they've all grown up already and I never got the chance to know my sisters
or be that &quot;big brother&quot; type of guy. They were supposed to have gone with
me to &quot;Busses on the Blue Ridge&quot; this year, but since that's been cancelled,
and &quot;Everybus&quot; was so early in the year, this visit was the substitute. Gwen
is 14 now, and a Freshman in HS, Rachel is 13 and in 8th grade still.  I
think my mom is near a nervous break-down from the two! Gwen is definitely
the more antagonistic type, and I think she purposely pushes mom to see just
how much she can get away with.  Rachel however has always seemed more
reserved and well, for lack of a better term 'spiritual' type of person.
I've always found that I can have a good, meaningful talk with her, where as
with Gwen its all about HS cliques and SpiceGirls and the fashion of the
day.  Get it?  I hope so 'cause I barely do! In all though, they seemed quit
the normal young teen-girls, and my mom and I would later have a good talk
about this  ;-).  Gwen spent most of the evening on the phone with her
friends, but Rachel and I sat and talked quite a bit. All of them (mom,
Gwen, Rachel) are all pretty un-happy in the south...  Mom just can't seem
to fit in with the 'Southern Mentality' of things, and my sisters complained
that the boys only want to talk about huntin' and something called
Truck-muddin'.  One boy wrote something in Gwen's yearbook about how the
&quot;Yankee's Will Pay&quot; and I think there is a lot of &quot;Anti-Yankee&quot; sentiment in
Huntsville to begin with.  One look at the Editorial Page of the local paper
will reveal a lot of locals complaining about all the &quot;Yanks&quot; moving down
there. And about how they're ruining the town.  Mom suspects they won't be
living there much longer...

The next day I got up early to say goodbye to Gwen and Rachel before they
left for school (Gwen wanted me to drive her to school in my bus!  Is that
kewl or what?  Hahaha .. I happily obliged).  After a breakfast and shower,
and some laundry, I set off to experiment with the bus once again.  Before I
got underway, I removed and cleaned out the whole of the carburetor,
adjusted my valves, and set my timing. Checked the vitals, replaced a
valve-cover that was seeping a bit, etc. I was still running the 045 main
jet remember?  And my plugs STILL looked lean!

With that done, all that was left was to pack up the bus and say my
good-byes to mom.  She started the mom-thing with the 'do you have enough
food' type worries, and sent me off with all sorts of munchies  ;-)

The directions from Madison to Dave's house in Marietta, would take me
mostly through state roads and old 2-lane highways east towards Atlanta.  I
was looking forward to getting off the Interstates for a while.   The bus
was maybe running *slightly* better after the tune-up (the valves were
pretty darned tight), but I was still running over 500 degrees on the heads,
and had VERY little power.  The roads I had selected turned out to be pretty
hilly, and I was getting nervous about making it to Dave's at all.   There
was one particular hill that had me down into 2nd gear, the pedal was
floored, and I was STILL losing ground.    For a few heart-pounding moments
I though I wasn't going to make it up.  I finally topped the hill just
before having to downshift into 1st.  I pulled of the road to let her cool
off a bit after that climb!  I was also instructed to watch for a place in
eastern Alabama called &quot;un-claimed baggage&quot;  which apparently is this
warehouse where all the un-claimed baggage and cargo and stuff from airports
all over the US ends up, for sale at rock-bottom prices!! A garage-sale
junkies wet dream come true!  Brendan and Josh would get so excited over
such a place, I'm sure they would spontaneously combust!  Luck was not with
me though, and I never saw the warehouse or any billboards for it.

Things got a little easier-going once I was back on the interstate headed
towards Atlanta.  Things were pretty much all down hill once I got off the
back-roads.  I got to Marietta just in time to experience the full-force of
the Atlanta rush-hour.  Good thing the bus runs nice and cool under
stop-and-go conditions.  I had some general directions to Marietta, a
printout from Dave on how to get to his house, and cheesy atlas I bought at
a truck-stop along the way to guide me.   I thought I was hopelessly lost,
but suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw my turn! Fought my way across
5 lanes of traffic in about 100 feet distance, and made it to Dave's
house!!!  There was NO MISTAKING the place, I was DEFINITELY at Crazy Dave's
Bus Farm!

It was about 6PM when I pulled up in front of the house, and Dave wasn't
home from work yet.  Not to worry, I just kicked back, sat in the back of
the bus with some Blues Brothers on the radio, watched the C-130 cargo
planes go over through the hatch, and listened to the trains go by.  I
thought to myself it was quite appropriate to be listened to Blues
Brothers...  &quot;how often does the train go by?&quot;...  &quot;So often you won't even
notice.&quot;
