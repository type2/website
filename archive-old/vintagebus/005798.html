Eric,

Some conventional wisdom holds that lack of properly working thremostat and
flaps keeps the engine from reaching proper operating temperature. Check
your oil filler cap for a white foamy substance.

Having the preheat tube hooked up made a big difference for us.

Regarding stock heat, I have made a few observations about the heat coming
out of the front vents.

Bob Hoover and VW are correct that the air flow is increased if you leave
the passenger side vent wing opened just a bit. This will let cold air in
but allow the pressure to equalize and increase the flow through the system.
The result I have observed is better demisting and defrosting.

After driving 3 hours in blinding snow and sub freezing temps on the
interstate -
Heat flow increased with a window slightly open and help keep the windows
clear.
Hotter heat at 55 mph the 65. Hmmm more rpms but less cold air rushing under
the bus cooler off the heater boxes?

Taping the rear heat log (Claraism for splitty rear heat tub under the seat)
do not really help like I though it would. Seem to get same flow with it
open and better overall comfort. BTW the heat log gets nice and toasty .
