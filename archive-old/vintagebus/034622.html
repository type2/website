 The one on the left is for non-semaphore Buses, it's dual filament.
 The one on the right is for semaphore Buses, single filament.
 
 People do sell the ones on the right as &quot;Barndoor&quot; as they technically could
 be considered &quot;replacement&quot; lenses.  They are incorrect.

actually I think they were sold from the dealership as replacement lenses for 
BDs.  for whatever reason, there are many more of those around NOS than other 
BLDL bus taillights.   so correct according to VW replacement parts, but not 
according to what actually came on the bus?
