Sundial campers did start there lives as panels which makes them kind of
unique.
Most other camper conversions were Kombis.  And Sundials also had just two
windows on the passenger side on the two cargo doors.  They eliminated the
third window on that side because there is a closet that went from the
cargo doors back.  Hope that helps.

&gt; Hello all.  I found a sundial camper at
&gt; http://home.inreach_dot_com/tmrj/bus/bus.html and was wondering about the rarity or
&gt; it.  This 65 is a double door which brings up a question.  Do campers start out
&gt; as a panels or kombis?  The way this one looks it might just be a double door
&gt; panel with the camper equipment installed.  On one of the pics it looks like it
&gt; only has windows on the doors....  Anyway, the owner says it has never been
&gt; wrecked and has no rust so maybe it is worth the $3700.  I am driving to Las
&gt; Vegas next week so I might just drive a bit further to LA and check it out.  Any
&gt; comments or advice is welcome.  I've been looking for a decent bus for 8 weeks
&gt; now!
