Subject: muffler bearings :-)

&lt;&lt;Just what is a muffler bearing?  I have never heard of this until now.
Forgive my newness. Thanks All, Jeff 1964 Sundial&gt;&gt;

Well Jeff seeing you're a newbie an all I'll spare you the harassmen. 
Muffler bearings are exactly the same thing as, blinker fluid, changing the
stale air in the tires of your bus every 6000 miles, 
or adding water to the radiator in a Ghia (Thanks Franklin Mint! - read the
fine print next tine they run the ad for the 1967 Ghia model)

These things do not exist. 
 
Most of these, except the Ghia thing, were a ploy from seedy auto repair
places to con more money out of unsuspecting fools.  
Now-a-days it is used as a funny satirical comment in the shop.

But, if you'd like I could sell you some NOS. muffler bearings I have in my
closet. Just Kiddin'  :-)
