Subject: brake shoes

Hi,

I want to know what brake shoes work best. So far lately I have tried what I 
thought was just standard shoes and they faded miserably on a downhill. I 
tried installing some semi-metalic shoes on the front and they faded even 
worse. Almost had an accident with those.

What do you guys recommend? Who is selling quality shoes? Is brake fade a 
fact of life for buses?

I would gladly trade in my shoes on Tuesday for a good set today!

Thanks,
Chris
