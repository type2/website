Subject: Re: [VB] Door question

&gt;    (2)The front doors on my '58 are packed full of fiberglass
&gt; insulation. I am assuming this is not a good idea due to
&gt; water drainage...am I right?
&gt; Thanks!!!
&gt; DUCK


Front doors full of insulation.......bad idea! What was trying to be
acomplished noise deadening and/or keeping heat in the bus?

If noise is a concern use some 3M asphalt panels in the inside of the door
to stop the door metal vibrating...... Also make sure there is a plastic
liner between the door and the door panel otherwise the panel will get wet
and moldy as well......
