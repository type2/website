Subject: Cool tin &amp; parts cleaner

While at the pull your part last week getting a few pieces of better
lower tin, I happened upon a 72 Ghia with under cylinder cool tin.
Figuring that original cool tin would be good for the DP 1600 I'm
building I grabbed it (takes a bit longer than I thought to &quot;grab it&quot;).

I forgot to mark which piece came off which side.  Is there a
difference?  I guess I don't use the flat air deflectors and the &quot;cool
tin&quot;...right???


Suggestions for parts cleaner to go into a parts washing tub (with
pump)?
