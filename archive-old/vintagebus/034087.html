The sump filter is a very fine Micron filter as used on airplanes, thus no
blowing out, i have been amazed as to the particals i find in this screen
when i change my oil. I feel this is fine enough to keep any particals out
that could damage your engine. Oberg filters do the same job but are very
pricey compared to CD's sump filter. Out here is the desert many of the off
road cars run Oberg verses spin on oil filters. Remember a good VW owner
will change there oil every 1500 to 2000 miles, so i would be more concerned
abouth the filtering aspect of the filter, verses the cleaning ability.

another of my opinions

ps. i probaly should send some oil out of each of my filtered engines to a
lab for testing to compare the difference in the cleaning ability of the
sump filter verses the spin on filter, after 1500 miles of driveing, useing
Kendal GT1, 30 weight oil.

&lt;&lt; The stock Vw. strainer is also in the sump, and I feel pretty lame at
 filtering.
 So this sump/filter seems to be a vast improvement, no ?
 Believe me,I doubt  it will ever come close to clogging!
  &gt;&gt;
Its no doubt an improvement, but still not much more then a skimmer. A 
full-flow system is still really the only way to go to do it right!
