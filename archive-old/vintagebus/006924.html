My cross country route as of today is I will be taking 80 out of Chicago to
I 55 to St Louis to I 44 south to I 40 West, depending on how things go I
will on the Hwy Sat afternoon, my goal is 700 miles a day, if you live along
this route and could let me use your drive to rest, or shower or to just BS,
please P mail me ( ronnie_at_oldvolks_dot_com). I will be driving a 24 ft Ryder
with a trailer.

I will have my cell with me and will call who ever is along the way when I'm
with-in a 100 miles if it isn't to late, or will call to let whoever know
I'm passing through, if they would like to hook up close to the hwy. Thanks
to all that responded after the first post of my trip and am looking forward
to meeting as many listy's as I can along the way
