Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Are keys the same

I recently got keys cut to code for my 67 riviera.  they looked up the codes 
in the computer (last time I did this they looked in the book!) set the 
machine to the code in the book, which  says how much to cut from the blank, put the 
key in there, and grumble chew ........voila.....a key with notches cut out 
according to the book.  

no, they did not enter all the stuff from the old book into the computer, 
they bought the program.... I asked about that, so at least back through L series 
your locksmith can get the code book on computer

&lt;&lt; As a registered locksmith (and bus owner), I've got to disagree with a 
 recent post stating that the only correct way to code cut a key is with a 
 pair of clippers.  Astually, a much more accurate way is with the use of 
 dedicated code cutting machines.  The do use a cutting wheel, but are 
 micrometer controlled.  When properly used, accuracy is easily within .002&quot;, 
 and frequently tighter.  Clippers cannot maintain this accuracy.  I keep 
 clippers as a secondary code cutting implement, but primarily use an HPC 
 1200 code cutter (a $3500 machine) as my primary method of code cutting 
 keys.  There are several other machines of that type available, and all do a 
 wonderful job when properly calibrated and operated.  A code cut key 
 generated with clippers is generaly fine, but I must disagree with the 
 statements made in the recent post.
