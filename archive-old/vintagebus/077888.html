&gt; my new/old 1500cc has a seized piston, any advice?

Hi Josh,
Take a sledge hammer and stick it under the stuck cylinder.  Then pound the 
top of the cylinder with a hammer.  Because the cylinder is made of cast iron 
it will shatter much like glass.  So do WEAR eye protection.  
  When finished completely rebuild engine.  We bet you let loose all the old 
oil sludge throughout the engine case in an avalanche to clog up the cooler 
and oil passages.  With mystery engines that have sat for a long time one must 
drive in town type driving no more than 30 minutes at a time with at least 30 
minutes between drives, and change oil every time it turns black or every 50 
miles for at least the first 300 miles.  This allows the engine to polish all 
the moving parts and not get too fricking hot that lets loose the sludge all at 
once!
