you did .torque. the pressure plate to the flywheel, right?  Memory says
18ft/lbs per bolts, but that may be wrong.

If not, i would hieighly suggest pulling tha tmotor and taking a torque
wrench to those bolts.   If one/some decide to work themselves out they
can do a fair bit of damage in the bellhousing.  Not to mention the warped
pressure plate this could case.


That said, i cant get eric's 73 to stop chattering either.;/

later...david
(might have something to do with the old clutch we had to put back in, as
a certian list-vendor shipped a vanagon clutch (220? 228?m) kit
instead...but he did accept fault and pay for return shipping.
