 1. How old were you when you first got sucked into being a VW maniac?
 When I was 16, a good friend of mine had a slammed 69 bug.
 
 2. what was your first car? what was your first VW? your first bus? (if 
there 
 not all the same)
 First car... 67 Camaro,  First VW... 62 Sedan (still have it), First bus... 
71 that I got for $400
 3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (don't list all the non-ops, this 
email 
 will be HUGE!)
1
 
 4. Do you have a favorite? which one?
 61 and earlier hardtop deluxes. They just look so sweet!
 
 
 5. stock or custom?
Depends on how it's done, slight customs are the best
 
 
 6. Would you punch an alien?
NO! He might whip out a switchblade or worse... a particle vaporizer
