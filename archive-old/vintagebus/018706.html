A fellow Split Bus Club member ended up with my old
Westy, It's nice to see it being used and kept up.

On the other hand, My brother sold his 1967 Squareback
sometime ago and watched it go to hell. The guy would
get stoned and forgot where he parked it.  

If a VW enthusiast wants a bus so bad he or she will
travel to another country, and pay to have it shipped
home, there should be no doubt it is going to a good
home.

I wonder what would &quot;anonymous&quot; would do if he saw his
dream VW for sale at a fair price... At the Bad
Camberg meet? Pass it up because his ethics dictate
that it can't leave Der Fatherland?
