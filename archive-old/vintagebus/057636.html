&gt; My question is what can I use to clear out the rest of the line, or should I

For flexable fuel line you could try:
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wolfsburg/fuelsystem/fuelline_rubber.htm
  Is it the flexable fuel line or the steel line in the chassi that is still 
partly plugged up?    Eric&amp;Barb
