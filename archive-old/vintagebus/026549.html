hehe... topic says it all
Why doesn't my bus start in the cold?  It started yesterday in 5 degree
weather...but now its -10 degrees.  The fuel is fine and there is no
water in it as I can see through my fuel filter.  It cranks, I even
hooked up my battery charger to it.  It comes close to starting....it
kind of coughs...but no vrrrooooom!  I'm just curious.  I could care
less today as I get a day off of school! woo hoo! hehe...
my mom's brand new D_at_dge Intrep!d won't start either...it cranks fine...
and it kinda shakes and acts like it wants to start..but no go.  It
almost feels like the timing is WAAAAY off ...but I know this isn't the
case.

ITS JUST TOO DAMN COLD!!

I need to move...
