 When did the voltage regulator change from round to square?
  &gt;&gt;
with the 25hp motors they used a 130W generator and the D regulator     

for 1954  withe the 36hp motor they introduced the narrow slot 160W generator 
and the round regulator
these are a pair

in think late 56 or early 57  (jan 57?) they went to the regular slot 160W 
gen and the square regulator

the 180W generator was introduced in june of 59, which also has a square 
regulator.

you have to make sure the Voltage, wattage and amperage of the reg and gen 
are the same.  not sure what happens if they don't match, there may be those 
electrical fumes and the bad things that means.

DATE CODE INFO (BORROWED FROM sTEVE cARR)
the generators have date codes on them.  a generator 
if the code is 2L, that means buildt feb 55  The code is near the arrow on 
the generator- by where it says Bosch.  date codes on regulators are near the 
scre wholes where it attachs to the generator.
the code is a number and letter, the letter stands for the year, and the 
number for the month.
