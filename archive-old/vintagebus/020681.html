Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Price Opinions??

Sounds pretty reasonable to me, depending on the scale
of the bodywork.  I am starting to feel that it is
cheaper to find a good clean original or restored bus
and pay a bit more.   I paid $1900 for my 66 Deluxe,
paid another G to have the nasty hippy paint scheme
soda blasted and I am still in process.  All that for
a nearly rust-free bus, which is a commodity in the
midwest.  I just picked up a real sweet '56 Packard
for only $7500 and the old owner (a co-worker)had over
$13,000 invested.  Not a VW story but I feel the same
applies with any collector car.  Sometimes you can
cash in on others peoples misforture.  (I realize that
that sounds awful but it is true)

&gt; Here we go again.  Just want some opinions (again)
&gt; on a 66 Westy I looked at
&gt; last week.  It's a 66 Pop-Top Walk Thru, 6 Volt with
&gt; 1500 motor (didn't hear
&gt; it run bad battery).  Has all the Camper interior
&gt; minus a door under the
&gt; bed.  Has jumpseat, Icebox and Spice Rack. It needs
&gt; a right rocker, short
&gt; panel behind cargo doors and right rear lower panel
&gt; where battery has leaked
&gt; and corroded the metal.  Also will need a battery
&gt; tray.  The seal looks good
&gt; for the top, but the canvas is gone.  Body had some
&gt; other surface rust that
&gt; can be sanded and primed, then you'll never know it
&gt; was ever there.  The guy
&gt; wants $1700 for it, down from $1995.  Sound fair for
&gt; an Eastcoast Bus?  One
&gt; of these days I'm going to find a Bus I really like.
&gt;  My 66 Kombi's nose was
&gt; much worse then I thought.
