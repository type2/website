 &lt;&lt;I'm quite interested because my oil bath air cleaner doesn't seem to fit 
 right I have to jam it onto the carb and it hits the top of my engine bay - 
 so..... I think that there must be a better one for me.  &gt;&gt;
 What is the part number of your air cleaner?  Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;
the bus did not come with a air cleaner that sits on the carb. which is why 
you would have problems putting a bug aircleaner on it.    it came with one 
that hung off the left side (until 64 or so when it went to the right side)  
anyone got a picture of the tube to the side, the triangle bracket, and a 
36hp or 40hp bus aircleaner?    If you have a bentley there are pictures in 
there.
