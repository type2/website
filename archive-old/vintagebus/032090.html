Just this week, a very tempting and interesting situation has come up.
I have the opportunity to pick up a 1962 Bus from an &quot;in-law&quot; for a very
cheap price.  I live in Truckee, CA and the bus is sitting in his back
yard in Espanola, NM.  It hasn't been driven since about 1990 but he
says he has started it &quot;a few times.&quot;  He says is definitely needs new
brakes (drums) all the way around. ...

1.  Is is worth it? (I know it is) I'd obviously have to tow it back
here to CA since I can't afford the time to go and out there and spend a
couple weeks fixing it up so it could make the long trek back.
 -- - - - - -  --
yes.  so worth it.  (you might ask for a couple pictures though)

2.  What is the time/effort/money involved in converting to 12-volt?
If I leave it 6 volt, what sort of things might come back to haunt me?
 ==  == =
basically, whether it is 12V or 6V you should clean all the electrical
connections and grounds.  I know this is boring, but  it does help.       Yes
especially for 6V.   My theory is if it ain't broke don't fix it, so why
switch from a good 6V system?   the list had a discussion on this recently,
and the fabled 6V dim lights are really cause of poor connections.    If you
need a replacemnt electrical part you may have to wait for it to be ordered
(such as generator or starter) but you won't have to hassle with voltage drop
for the wipers.
....
3.  What is the time/effort/money involved in doing the brakes?  I've
never done brakes on any car I've ever owned.

not that bad.    I would replace all the wheel cylinders and the rubber hoses
and pads if needed and master cylinder if it leaks.
....
4.  I'm thinking of flying out there for a quick weekend to take a look
at the bus.  Would anyone in the area be interested in doing a little
research with me?
-  -- - -
taking a look is good.   Towing is a good idea,  because a motor that has sat
so long would be unhappy to suddenly be expected to haul hundreds of freeway
miles and should be driven a round town for a few hundred miles with an oil
chang and tranny oil change and keeping an eye on things cause sometimes
sitting so long does it in and could make a valve stick.     In fact if you
tow it on its wheels do a tranny oil change befor eyou leave with it and make
sure the tranny boots are good .
