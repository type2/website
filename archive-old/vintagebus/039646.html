&gt;
&gt;How many miles do these things go before they &quot;break&quot;. Just replaced my 
&gt;Pertronix Ignitor which flatlined at 5.4 volts (shorted according to the 
&gt;trouble shooting sheet)  with the original points. Only had 9000 miles on 
&gt;it and it really provided a smoother idle to the motor with slightly 
&gt;improved gas mileage.
&gt;


My pertronix is still going strong since I bought it in 1992. I dont know 
how many miles that is but let me think:
I would say about 60,000 at a conservative estimate.
Intersting enough, our local VW only place will NOT sell them anymore for he 
feels that they have declined in quality. Maybe you are seeing that problem.
I grabbed one from a junkyard about 3 months ago and it seems to work fine 
as well.
For those of you who are hopefull, I have been looking for junkyard 
pertronix for years. And I was lucky. Not an easy find.
