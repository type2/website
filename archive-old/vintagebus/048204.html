&lt;&lt; I see this 18&quot; banjo steering wheel on ebay. Could someone check it out and
 let me know if it'd fit on a bus, and what year if it does?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
We would guess that it is for Porshe in the mid 1950s which should have large 
splines.  The only way to possibly see if it would fit on a bus is to ask the 
seller if it has a taper inside with woodruff key slot, or if it is splined.  
The former might work for pre-1968 bus and the latter will only work for type 
1s, and wether it will work for pre-1958 large splined steering rod or the 
later small splined type 1 would be another question.   Eric&amp;Barb
