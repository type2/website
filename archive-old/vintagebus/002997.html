Subject: BUS SICKNESS

I recently sold my 67 westy in order to get going on my 60 european bug and
I just didnt have the room for the bus right now where I live. This was only
3 weeks ago and while out driving this weekend I located by accident a 61
doublecab that is in very salvageable shape only 10 miles from where I live
and very cheap. I cant believe it but I'm seriously thinking about buying
it. It has the OG motor and all the parts are there except the drivers door
handle and rear bumper and is still 6 volt. My question is, AM I SICK? I
cant stop myself and have no control, I need to find a way to convince my
wife that we need this, I hope I'm not the only one that is this way, should
I be committed?
