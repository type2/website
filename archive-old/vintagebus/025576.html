Subject: Re: intake scoops
Message-ID: &lt;3771BC94.91FCCB07_at_gateway_dot_net&gt;

at highway speeds, they do (undoubtedly) increase air intake, but at an
idle, and slower speeds (non-highway) they actually restrict air.

i have no proof anywhere, i have just heard some people say they have
read it somewhere.  

my only real problem is the holes you have to drill to mount them.  i
would like to find a site on the net that had actual data on different
speeds, and rpms to test what did what and when.

&gt; I doubt they reduce the air intake.  By design they force air into the engine
&gt; compartment.  They could'nt help but to do that.  This is good especially if
&gt; you have air leaks in the engine compartment.  I use them on my rusty westy
&gt; only (very holy, or is that holey), as I think they look terrable on a vintage
&gt; bus.
