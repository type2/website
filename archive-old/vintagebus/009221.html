At a Wetwesties [Pac. NW family VW camping club] outing this weekend one of
the participants was having charging problems.  His immaculate '58 Westy has
a brand-new 1600DP, and all the ancillaries are also brand new 6-volt items.
The whole setup has just a few hundred miles on it.

After a series of checks it was determined that the new BOSCH regulator was
barely putting out 6.0V at 2500+RPM.  He had an identical new-in-the-box
BOSCH regulator, so it was installed.

At 2500+RPM the replacement regulator put out 7.5V, just as it should.
Problem solved.

Just one more reason not to assume that new parts are, by definition,
&quot;OK&quot;.....
