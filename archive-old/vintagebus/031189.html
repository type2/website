Subject: Any old Tamiya radio controlled cars

I know it's a bit off topic although Tamiya did make some nice Baja
stuff in the 80's - shame they didn't make a bus!

I'm getting a bit obsessed with old Tamiya stuff and so this is a
request for any old stuff you may have -  I may be interested in it.
In  particular:  SuperChamp, Toyota Hilux, Blazing Blazer, Subaru Brat,
Audi  Quattro, Lancia rally, Whilly's Wheeler or anything you may have.
Also if you're a fellow collector it might still be worthing mailing me.

For those of you that recall the monster bus that I chopped up and
turned into a 15 window is going in fot paint next week so it looks like
I'll have another shiney bus again. I'll get some pictures sorted when
it's done.
