John,

We ran into a similar thing with my uncle's 67 bug.  We ended up replacing
the coil center wire to the distributor cap and viola!  This was, of course,
the last thing we tried and it took us a couple of hours of debugging to get
there, but that was our culprit in the end.

A debugging hint if you need one... park your 66 Westy next/near the bug and
swap parts until you find your culprit.  Try to start your Westy when you
try a bug part in it and try to start the bug when you have known good Westy
parts in it.  Having access to another vehicle of comparable parts is always
a good way to figure out which parts may be sub-par.

Good luck.
Greg
