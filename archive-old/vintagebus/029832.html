My 62 has 4 of these brackets all together.  2 of them are mounted on the bulkhead for the upper portion of the seat to be adjusted...and the other 2 are mounted on the... seat stand should i call it?... so that the bottom portion of the seat can be adjusted too.  I have mine all the
way back...both of them..... and I still get cramped in there...  but I like the 'bouncy' effect of the seat...

Also...be careful with these brackets... as they like to bend...the metal between the adjusters that is.. its thin.  I had to work with mine a bit to get the seat to fit in it just right.

hope that helps...

&gt; On 61/62 front &quot;hump&quot; seats with the 3 position brackets, did just the back rest have the 3 positions or did the seat base adjust with them also?  I mean to say, do I need two 3 position brackets or 4 to make my 62 correct?  I've found the seat and two brackets, do I need two more?
