Subject: [VB] Swing Lever kit. Trouble and questions


Anyone out there know what the OD of the busing for
the Swing lever is suposed to be?    I am having a
heck of a time getting the right bushing.  I am on my
third kit and still i do not think it is right. 
Anyone know where to buy just the bushings?

History:

Kit one had bushings that were over .125&quot; small on the
OD from my original.  I think they were for a Gen 2
bus as they zirk holes were on the wrong spot and the
innser groove did not come out the edge.  (Don't know
who made it)

Kit Two (Bilstein) did not have bushings at all.

Kit Three (Meyle) has bushings but they are about
.025&quot; smaller on the OD and are Split.  (They have an
expansion/comprestion gap down one side and are
constructed more like cam bearings then the original
brass.

What brand have you all used?  Where did you get it
and what did you pay?  I have the reamer and all the
gear to R&amp;R it but i need some bushing that will fit.

Bummer thing is that upon inspection i think my old
ones were fine to begine with.

Thanks for the help.

Matt
