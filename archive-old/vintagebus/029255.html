Boy this has been on my mind quite a bit lately!

My Jetta has been in the shop so I've been driving the 62 DC to Burbank and
back (70 miles on the 5 through East LA...hommie) for a week now.  I also
drove down to the Familinfest on Friday night (about 100 miles).  All this
driving has given me great insight (and respect to those who do it every day)
on what it takes to pilot a 38 year old bus on the freeways of Southern CA!

I can not drift off into that comfortable routine of driving the same route
every morning like I can in the water pumper.  Traveling at only 60-65 feels
like you are standing still.   Even the semi trucks run 70-75 when they can.
Now I know why Scott switched to the T4.  I'm running a 1600 with a 67 big
nut, so I'm a bit better off than the stock tranny, but I still stick to the
slow lane.  I am constantly scanning all 3 mirrors for any potential bogies.
Mostly I'm looking for the yahoos that are running fast in the slow lane.
More than a few times each trip I have to flicker my brake lights to warn
people that I'm there.  I have 12V big (62&gt;) brake lights so it usually
works.  The pearl white truck most likely blends into the pavement and the
smog around these parts so that doesn't help either.

On the way down the 15 (long unlit stretch of hwy.) to my parents, on friday
night, got me to thinking.  After about the 5th time doing the brake light
warning thing, I got to thinking I'm going to put a T3 reverse light on the
overider and wire it in to a dome light switch (since mine is missing and I
wouldn't use it anyway) on the speedo pod.  This way I can flash people I see
running up my arse ;-)

Anyone done this yet?  Does it piss people off?  I guess I really don't care
as long as it keeps them from F'ing up the perfect rear corners on this 62.

Anyone got an extra light?
