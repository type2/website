&lt;&lt; I've got a set of back-up lights that came off my '66 parts bus. I was 
wondering if someone would mine looking at them and telling me if they were 
original on this bus or not. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
These look like the stock ones for the latter half of 1967 production.  Are 
the holes in the body for them clean and smooth like they had been pressed or 
jagged and rough like a saw of some type was used?  There were back up lights 
for the late 1950s thru the early 1960s that were a stock accessory that only 
one was to mount in the left rear corner.  Pretty much the same but different 
&gt;from the 1967 lights if you know what we mean.  Eric&amp;Barb
