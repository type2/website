&gt; .....When I did my '59 Kombi, I mounted some of the enclosed speakers under my
&gt; parcel tray. Worked real good and only made one small hole in the try for
&gt; each speaker. They look like you'd hit your knees on 'em...but in reality
&gt; they didn't even come close to getting in the way.

I did the similar thing as Rex &amp; George, but mounted Bose 6 x 9's which are
designed for outdoors/underwater/high vibration conditions!  All these
conditions were present in the 63 DC, so why not!  Sounds great, but not
recommended in a hi theft area, which I 'm not in.  I also took the Bose
labels off the speakers which made em look more generic, FWIW.
