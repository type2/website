Subject: 1500 super?

rescued a &quot;1500 super&quot;  motor today; i'm guessing this is out of a 
type 3, as it has the weird lil bracket above the pulley and 311 
heads...  it also had bolt-on valve covers and ke-well stingers - is 
there anything inside worth looking for, or is this just a standard 
upright?
bolt-ons had &quot;40-2400&quot; and a logo which is the outline of a crucible 
with 'H' in the mddle. ring any bells?
