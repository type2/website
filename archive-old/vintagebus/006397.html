Subject: Bus Update for May 5th, 2000

Once again, the routine that I've seen for the past 6 weeks was followed and
I found myself at the grandparent's shop.  I've become increasing irritated
at the fact my idle stops for my Weber 40IDF's have not shown up yet despite
me ordering them April 25th.  Does it really take 10 days to get parts from
New York state?  I think a phone call is in order.  I need those parts so I
can get my 1776 tested out.  I told my grandfather that if those parts
didn't show up, I'd put the 1600DP back in the bus so he could have his shop
back.  No big deal - it's just another engine pull that I don't want to have
to do.

I started the evening by monkeying around with the Webster wire wheel
recorder.  I spent about an hour doing a ton of adjustments and actually got
the thing to not only play, but recording me singing an old Jim Reeves tune.
I love this old electronic stuff (remember the Sapphire experience?) :-)  I
spent the rest of my evening listening to 4 guys' gospel choir singing from
about 40 to 50 years ago.

I did the 12v relay switcheroo and it cleared up ALL of my wiring glitches I
previously had with no front turnsignals, no hazards, etc.  It's all working
now - brake lites, turn signals, everything.  This is good.  Then I turned
on the wipers and about had a cow when the wipers jumped out of the confines
of the windshield all over the place.  Hmmm...seems I never bothered to
adjust them seeings as how I thought they park like Amercan cars.  After a
little tweaking, the wipers are working fine.  I celebrated by cleaning the
front windows with Windex and newspaper.

About this time, wire wheel spool #2 was done so I rewound it, cleaned up
the shop, and came home.

More later...
