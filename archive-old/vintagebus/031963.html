Hi Kevin,
If this has come on suddenly and in more than one gear it sounds like you 
need to either adjust your clutch pedal properly or take the engine out and 
inspect the inputshaft, TO bearing (For center also), the needle bearings 
inside the gland bolt, the pressure plate arms, and the clutch disc.
