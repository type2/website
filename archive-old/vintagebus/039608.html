From my VW mechanic who used to work in the dealerships back in the 60's:

For the easiest way, put the rivet and clip in the rim, bolt the rim to the 
drum, and use an impact hammer to round the back side.  The drum'll hold 
everything in place.  I haven't tried it, but it sounds like it should work, 
but I think the rivet's would then be backwards?

And then he said the not so easy way was the hammer/anvil technique 
mentioned previously.

Alex
