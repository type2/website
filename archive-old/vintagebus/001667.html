Subject: double cab rear seat bolt

Hi All,

I just want to confirm with all the talk about seat retainment lately that
the double cab actually used a carriage bolt to hold the rear seat pedestal
to the cab wall instead of the normal T bolt found in most busses...  The
one bolt that I have is metric (I'm looking for another) and I really doubt
that the previous owner would have replaced the T bolts with a metric part.
The parts manuals don't show anything for the double cab.  My bolt by the
way is the same size and thread pitch as that of a safari wing bolt.

So, wadda you all say?

David
