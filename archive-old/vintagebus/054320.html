Subject: RE: [VB] Engine dies at low speed

[...]

You don't say what engine you have or what carb.  Could be somethng
like the air fuel mixture adjustment for the carb idle circuit.  This
may have been overridden by the binding linkage.  Now that you fixed
the linkage, the carb may be responding to its idle circuit as is
normal.  My guess but I could be wrong since I don't know what you
have.

&gt;My bus has begun dying at stop signs, and sometimes, when I take my 
&gt;foot off
&gt;the accelerator to go around a corner or just slow down the engine 
&gt;dies.
&gt;This is a relatively new situation, always before it idled very well.
&gt;The problem started when I discovered that the tube which carries the
&gt;accelerator cable through the fan shroud had become displaced and was
&gt;pressed up agains the carbuerator linkage. I moved the tube back to 
&gt;its
&gt;correct place, but now I'm experiencing the problem above.
&gt;Any tips?
&gt;Thanks in Advance
