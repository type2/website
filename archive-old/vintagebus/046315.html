&lt;&lt; I have a 4 new empi chrome shocks... I think the catalog says they will fit
 a 68 and newer bug... can't remember...    Anyway, could I somehow mount 
these on my 59 double cab?????  &gt;&gt;

Hi David,
They will not due to the later ball joint style front type 1 beam.  Even if 
they did you would be better off with stiffer KYB gas shocks.   Eric&amp;Barb
=  == = = 
I prefer the kyb gr-2s rather than the gas-a-just shocks.      I put the 
GR-2s on the front of my 65 westy, and magically most of the bumps in the 
road disappeared.  A couple days later I put the Gas a just on the back, and 
it became slightly bumpier.   The previous shocks were over 30 years old. (by 
the vw date stamped in)

but wouldn't mind chrome shocks for my 69 bug  :)   which has the cut  rear 
wheel wells and camo paint coming through the blue.
