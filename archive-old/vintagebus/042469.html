another tidbit from that site...

2. What happens if API GL-5 gear oil is used in an API GL-4 gear oil
application? 

API GL-4 and API GL-5 products typically use the same extreme pressure
(EP) additive system, with the API GL-5 having about twice the
concentration of a API GL-4. In service, these additives become active
under extreme load and temperature when the protective oil film can be
squeezed away. EP additives work by forming wear-resistant compounds with
the metal of the gear tooth surface. As the gears mesh, these compounds
shield the gear teeth from direct metal-to-metal contact that would cause
wear and damage to the gears. If too little of the active additive is
present, proper protection would be compromised. Too much of this additive
could cause excessive chemical corrosion of the gear surface. If an API
GL-5 gear oil is used in a application where API GL-4 gear oil is called
for, chemical corrosion of &quot;yellow metal&quot; components may occur, such as
bronze synchronizers, brass bushings, etc. This may lead to shifting
difficulties or shortened equipment life. 

take care,

Steve
