Subject: Sundial or EZ camper - revised

Something that I forgot to add to my earlier post was that the bed 
converts in to a seat very easily. It has two chains attached in the 
middle and has a board with two piano hinges, one attached to the body 
and one to the seat back. It appears to be the mechanism that allows the 
bed to convert into seat so easily. I hope this helps with the 
identification.


&lt;I am trying to find out what type of camper I have (Sundial, EZ, or?). 
I thought that my recently acquired '67 panel conversion (camper) was/is 
a Sundial. I do not know this for sure. I have crank out side windows 
that are supposedly common to both. I also have a cutout on the roof for 
a crank-up (?) air vent similar to those found on travel trailers. The 
cut-out looks like it was done at the same time as the windows but I 
don't know this for sure. The exterior-side attach tent is red and white 
with funny decoration on the edges. I don't know what the decoration is 
called, it is hanging string type of stuff (real technical description). 
I am also missing the cabinet/seat that was directly behind the front 
seat so I cannot describe them. Does anyone on the list know what type 
of camper it is or how I can acquire the information. I am trying to 
restore the camper to stock but I need to learn what stock is.&gt;
