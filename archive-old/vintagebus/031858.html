This whole VWoA thing is really strange on how they are going about it. One
of my suppliers had a container load of VW hubcaps confiscated and
destroyed, which doesn't make any sense since VW doesn't sell early hubcaps
and nobody that I know of has a license with them to sell them. Then another
supplier had all there license plate frames with VW 19## taken along with
all there T-shirts with the Volkswagen name and VW Logo on them. RMMW are
going to fight them and from what I have heard through the grape vine have
hired a bank of attorneys to do so. Mid-America is cooperating with VWoA,
but they know the ropes being they are one of the largest Corvette
aftermarket suppliers in the world. It is going to be interesting to see
what comes of the VW rampage.
