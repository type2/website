Cool to see list member's busses getting the &quot;metwiz&quot; treatment!
I'll be watching.

&gt; Hiya list, Well i'm still alive, survived the surgery on my beak. Managed to
&gt; get a sinus infection on top of it 2 weeks into recovery, didn't help
&gt; matters for sure, slowed down my recovery and getting back to work in the
&gt; shop though , as of today i'm back wide open but still fighting the sinus
&gt; infection. Kent's 56 Sunroof standard left saturday afternoon via their
&gt; trailer and a big Excursion, they were routing thru Columbus OH to pick up
&gt; some parts on the way back to St Louis. They dropped off a 56 Kombi Sunroof
&gt; as their next project in the future.
&gt;  This opened up a space in the shop for Steve Dolan's 67 westy which we'll
&gt; start probably next week. This week we are working on catching up on parts
&gt; if thats possible and this friday Mark Barnes and i intend to return the 66
&gt; 21 window to Toma and Karen Keller in Elkridge MD, and pick up Patrick
&gt; Flynn's 67 westy  on the back haul.
&gt;  Hopefully i'll have the web pages updated this week as well or by next
&gt; monday anyway.
&gt; We are also working on a plan to ,if it works out to take Neil Picketts 58
&gt; Hardtop Deluxe to Mark Rafferty in Fla. in Nov and catch the Bulli Brigade
&gt; show in the process. If you have something in that area you need transported
&gt; back this direction (we'll be coming back to central NC) p-mail me and for a
&gt; fee you can get it here, grin,,. ok thats nuff said for now ,,later
