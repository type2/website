Hello All,
  I E-mailed Arm&amp;Hammer and asked about Bulk
baking soda and where to get it and what I wanted
it for. This is the responce that they sent me.
It is in Washington state, but you may have the
same available in your state also. I also talked
to a guy that his bussiness is Soda blasting, he
had nothing but exelent things to say about the
process. He just did a 53 Corvette with 5 coats
of paint, he was able to blast down to the
original Gell coat, normal sand blasting will
blow holes in fiberglass. Think about Westy and
other camper tops. And it is envoironmentaly safe
and cheap. He sells 50# bags for about $26. If
you use a cabinet that will last a long time. He
also said he only uses a dust/partical mask, no
expencive resporators.
  I am going to give it a shot, when I do I will
pas on the findings.

&gt; sound crazy, but it works great! Any help would
&gt; be great.
