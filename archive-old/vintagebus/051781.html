Completely stock often means
&gt; no original thought and no personality.

I couldn't agree more! I too find a Barndoor rather
bland and find myself losing them in Detroits fields
on minivans. Especially the horribly dull chestnut
brown and sealing wax red deluxe. A camper as well
cannot come close to giving anyone a sense of
adventure. Seeing one is as unmoving as spotting a
Winnebago on I5. A stock Kombi, Panel, Single or
Doublecab is often overlooked as it blends in with
it's american counterparts hauling goods to and from
it's many destinations.
 I think you underestimate the Bus. It has plenty of
personality on it's own but don't think it needs YOU
to help it find itself.

&gt; I for one really like the bus you built.There's

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;It is a sort of subset of the custom vs.
&gt; stock resto schism. Though
&gt; it seems that the stock resto freaks get a fair
&gt; share of dissing (you'll
&gt; hear
&gt; &quot;vintage nazi&quot; a lot for anyone who is not pro
&gt; custom), not just the folks
&gt; who make a DD slammed sunroof panel dressed up tart
&gt; out of what had once
&gt; been
&gt; a decent honest working bus.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;        I normally try and just brush off all the
&gt; comments I have gotten from
&gt; the list, but am tired of the narrow minded,
&gt; uninformed &quot;opinions&quot; many
&gt; people seem to form about a bus they know VERY
&gt; little or nothing about.  Let
&gt; the record show, I have NEVER dissed on anyone's VW
&gt; project or bus on this
&gt; list.
&gt; 
&gt;        I beg to differ about the shape of my bus
&gt; before I started it.  This
&gt; bus was bought, for $400, from Lavere's, and was
&gt; minus ALL it's parts, and
&gt; very rusty, with the wrong doors, gas tank, no
&gt; engine lid, nice toyota high
&gt; back seats up front, welded down!!, no side windows,
&gt; no engine, had a HUGE
&gt; hole cut in the roof, and all the supports running
&gt; side to side had been
&gt; hacked out, I am not mentioning all the rust that
&gt; was ALL the way through
&gt; the
&gt; rain gutter, and bondo'ed over, and the 200 hundred
&gt; holes drilled over the
&gt; last 40 years or so, which I refer to as home
&gt; improvements.  That is a much
&gt; better description of the original shape of my bus,
&gt; not a &quot;decent honest
&gt; working bus&quot;.  My bus stoped being a decent honest
&gt; working bus MANY decades
&gt; before I saved it.  Not many people would have taken
&gt; the time, money, or
&gt; effort to do ANYTHING with this bus.  Please try and
&gt; not diss me for SAVING
&gt; another VW from the crusher.  And I have saved my
&gt; fair share.
&gt;        Take a look at Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz I built. 
&gt; A lot of people had
&gt; plenty to say about me building my bus (bad stuff),
&gt; but VERY few stood up
&gt; and
&gt; said &quot;hey good job on Dans bus&quot;.  I think if you
&gt; look at the pictures,
&gt; you'll
&gt; also agree again, not many would have fixed and
&gt; saved that bus the way I
&gt; did!
&gt;        Not to diss anyone, but if the issue of my
&gt; bus is the donor bus parts
&gt; from other buses, I have seen pics of &quot;hoopty buses&quot;
&gt; that were cut up that
&gt; actually ran and drove.  Nothing I cut up was ever
&gt; gonna be restored!
&gt; Infact
&gt; I didn't even cut them, I bought the parts via the
&gt; internet, from people
&gt; just
&gt; like all of you!!!
&gt;        Can we stop beating this dead horse!  We all
&gt; have our own way of
&gt; building our VW's.  Can we all just let each other
&gt; enjoy VW's as a whole no
&gt; matter how we build them!
