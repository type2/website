just got the bus back for the body shop and im about ready to tackle putting
the sunroof on. it didnt have one when i bought it so i have no idea how it
screws on or even goes together. does anyone have any suggestions abuot how i
should go about this?

the Bentley book has direction (with pictures) in the Body section.

what colour is your bus?  The beautiful turquoise/bluewhite 64s came with a
tinted green headliner (so groovy)  but doubt you could get one unless it was
custom made.
