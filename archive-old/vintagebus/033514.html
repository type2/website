I've got some stuff at home that may or may not be worth scanning. I've got 
quite a few of the different &quot;without guesswork&quot; books from different 
years....as well as some VW documents on installing AC units into T1's and 
T3's (no busses unfortunatly). If you guys think it'd be worth it, I'll 
send them to S. Hedberg and let him scan them. Let me know.

&gt;We need to aknowledge Jon Furst's (hazetguy) leap of faith is parting with 
&gt;this manual to an unknown to make the manual available for the &quot;list&quot;.
&gt;Without him this would not have been possible.  As said so many times 
&gt;before on the &quot;list&quot;, this is what makes this group special among all the 
&gt;web lists out there.
&gt;
&gt;I want to reiterate my offer to help in the scanning of any documents 
&gt;considered desirable for sharing among our fellow enthusiasts. Thanks.
