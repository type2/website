Subject: Re: Everybus Chili contest

Oh, man - we gotta have rules?
With 3 weeks to go, I guess it's time to decide how the annual Everybus Chili 
cookoff and world hunger abatement project is &quot;supposed&quot; to go.

Again this year, 2 classes, meat and meatless.  Hot isn't the grail.  Flavor, 
consistency, presentation, aroma and aftertaste are what wins the favor of 
the judges.  Last year one entry was presented exceptionally well and that 
alone would have won the contest except for a wonderful smoky pepper that 
blew the judges away!

You can make it there that day, or you can make it ahead of time.  Depends on 
how your chili likes to be eaten.  A couple years ago I spent much of 
Saturday going around helping folks cut up ingredients and whatever I could 
to help them be ready in time.  If you want to cook it there, it's perfectly 
ok to have your ingredients cut up beforehand.  If you cook it ahead of time, 
that's fine, again I would think it depends if your recipe prefers to be 
served &quot;fresh&quot; or &quot;aged&quot;.

I make one request.  Last year I inadvertently sampled a chili with an 
ingredient I am allergic to and had to run around the corner and 'uneat' the 
chili.  I ask that entries have a list of ingredients so others are spared a 
similar indignity.   Don't care how much of what is there, just that it's 
there.  I apologize for this inconvenience but I hope this is not 
unreasonable to ask.

If you don't feel that you can make world class chili, don't fret it.  This 
year there is also an additional category, Best Side Dish.  What goes well 
with chili?

There will be prizes (I think) and with it goes the prestige of being &quot;the 
best of the best&quot; in the world of Everybus Chili.  Frank Biffath watch yer 
back, they're gunnin' for ya!

Seeya there
