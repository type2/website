 It was a kombi with 6 pop outs [they are gone]. Non-walkthru with no rear
 heater log. Strange thing is: it appeared to have been a factory two-tone
 velvet? green bottom/white top half. I thought kombis were single paint 
color?
 Never appeared to have had a headliner or interior panels in the rear.

  you see the occasionally factory two tone westy.  usually owner imported at 
some time.
