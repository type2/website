Why is everyone all bent out of shape over air intake area and restricting
air-flow?  The only thing you need to consider is that they are butt-ugly,
and anyone who runs them had better not show their face at a show less they
endure extreme ridicule and shame!

&gt;at highway speeds, they do (undoubtedly) increase air intake, but at an
&gt;idle, and slower speeds (non-highway) they actually restrict air.
