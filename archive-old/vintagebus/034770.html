&gt;  The 30/31 (from Ronnie) that I put on mine worked perfectly from the first
&gt;  start.  It comes with an adapter for the dual-port manifold, or you might
&gt;  be able to scrouge up a 30mm manifold center section.
&gt;  
&gt;  Do put a _good_ filter between the tank outlet and the pump.  I've found
&gt;  that the 30/31s aren't tolerant of debris in the fuel.  I had to pull mine
&gt;  apart and give it a good cleaning to get rid of some fiberous stuff that
&gt;  was caught in one of the jets after about 4000 miles.

hm.......   about the 30/31.  I bought a new one about ten years ago, and it 
has been on my bug ever since.  last year I had to clean it out, after about 
40 or 50K miles.
