Subject: The bus nose that wouldn't die!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Some of you may remember my story about the nose off a parts bus I had
showing up at the local flea market. Well, it didn't last long. I just
found out that an art-sy, junky, collectible kind of place here in town
bought it for $150!!!!! Remember, I bought the whole bus filled to the
ceiling with parts for $75. I stripped EVERYTHING off of it so all that was
left was the shell, no doors, mechanics of any kind. It looked like that
picture in the bentley. This thing just won't die!

I think I'll go over there and tell 'em I can fix it up with the turn
signals, headlights, emblem, glass, and a front bumper and make the lights
work and flash and stuff for a fee$$$$. I mean, I do have all the stuff
that was on it before I got rid of it. All you folks sending whole busses
to the junkyard take note! One man's trash, another man's treasure. Might
as well make money off your trash!
