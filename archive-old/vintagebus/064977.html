Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor issues

If you have a lot of vertical play in the distributor shaft you have to
have the spring under it or your timing can bump + or - degrees at
various rpms.
It might only be a half degree but it would throw off both timing and
advance.
It could cause backfire if your settings are marginal.
