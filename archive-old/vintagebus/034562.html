In a message dated 98-12-05 23:39:33 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; I have noticed in a few of my catalogs that the front wheel cylinders are
 different for 55-63 and 64-70 busses.  The different two cylinders are said
 to be both 25.40mm.  I know the rears are the same from 55-71.  Are these
 fronts interchangable also? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jamie,
The 1955-63 rear cylinders can be use on either side on the rear only.  While
the front cylinders of the same years are left and right side only.  Then with
the 1963 only one ton M 215 suspension and the 1964-67 rear cylinders that are
either side also.  Once again the front cylinders for these years and types
are left and right only.  None of the 1955-63 brake cylinders can be used on a
1963 only one ton suspension or the 1964-67 buses and visa versa.    Eric &amp;
