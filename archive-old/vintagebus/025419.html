Just got back from the local once-a-month Antique Auto Flea market.
Spent more than I should have, but had fun....

Best buy of morning: an early NOS Matchbox Westy in the box for $20

Other good deals:

Avon Dunebuggy (still full of Hair Lotion) in the box $3 (I've never
even seen one with the box)

1979 Type II dealer brochure (13 pages, 7 pages on Westfalia) $5

August 1957 Foreign Car Guide &quot;This Issue Featuring the VOLKSWAGEN&quot;
two different newspaper articles inside front cover dated July 6th,
1957.
One article on Camper Home Kit, another on a Kombi camper conversion.
How-to article on installing an oil temp gauge.  Inside front cover-Ad
for a MotoMeter 3-in-1 gauge (I have one for sale for 6V system, works
great and has both gas sender and oil temp sender).
Paid $20, a little high, but in near perfect condition...

I'll be scanning the Bus stuff sometime later today if anyone is
interested in seeing it... (Joe Clark... you want me to send this to
you...??)

Take care...

JonR
