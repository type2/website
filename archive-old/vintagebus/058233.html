Now you can say that VW is infiltrating everywhere. 
Even places most guys can't get to.  =)

&gt;Ahem....geez Thom,
&gt;
&gt;That's Hot VW's, not VW Trends.  And they seem to be maturing.  Lately the term has evolved into 'sanitary'.  
&gt;
&gt;Hehe---I vote for renaming the thread to &quot;Ben Pon's Sanitary Napkins&quot;

&gt;&gt;And didn't VW Trends do an article on how &quot;sano&quot; those napkins were?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The napkin was the exact size and color as the original, and both the sketch
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the signature looked authentic...it was the Empi logo that gave it away
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a repro.  VOA lawyers have contacted Empi about the unauthorized
&gt;&gt;&gt; reproduction and the use of the name &quot;Ben&quot; which VOA has trademarked.
