Ya, I like the feel of the 9 spring clutch better too.   If you already bought the pad thing, why not keep using the new pad, but rinse off the 9 spring metal part of the clutch in gasoline or brake cleaner, and then scuff up the face where it'll hit the pad with sandpaper like St Muir said.  

I guess you solved the source of the oil issue, the oil seal or whatever it was (?)

Well I feel  better if you're pulling the motor to mess with the clutch too.

&gt; Clara,
&gt; Do you have good experience with cleaning off clutch discs? I have an old
&gt; German clutch plate cover with a disc that began slipping. I changed it and
&gt; put in a diaphram clutch and disc. It is harder to control and wish I could
&gt; use the original one I have. I'm afraid that the oil soaked disc may just
&gt; slip again. Is there a way to tell if the clutch cover is any good besides
&gt; just looking at it closely for wear? Anything else to look 
&gt; for?
