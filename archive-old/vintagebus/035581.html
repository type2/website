&gt;  &gt;With all this talk about engines what is the average life expectancy of a
&gt;  &gt;good rebuilt 1600dp or 1776dp.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  
&gt;  You have no idea what a can of worms you are opening.
&gt;  
&gt;  A 1600 dp is less likely to live as long as a 1600 sp. Cracked heads my 
&gt;  friend. Although that isnt that big of a deal. It will still run.
&gt;  They can be made to not break but this costs money. I know of a shop that 
&gt;  will weld them and change the spark plug hole and guarantees them for 
&gt;  100,000.
&gt;  
I think some people have been going around with cracked heads for years.

(sorry, couldn't resist)

on the serious side, since you can now get new DP heads for circa $105 ea, is 
it worth it to have all that work done?

FWIW, prefer SP myself.     Though is I stumbled upon a DP 36hp setup, I 
might be convinced to put it in my 53.      Hm, anyone know if those okrassa 
heads are likely to crack?  I just have the idea they are better designed.   
I had found some, they were not cracked where the 1600DP heads tend to. 
(though I ended trading them away) and what are the odds of finding used pair 
DP 1600 heads w/o cracks?
