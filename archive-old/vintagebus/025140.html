Dang them Washingtonians anyways for naming a town so unpronouncably.



But Pile Up was a blast. Indoors, rainy in the AM, nice in the
afternoon.  Set up the night before was when the real deals happened, as
with every show/swap. Ty Hodges and Janelle, and Darren and Nancy Wiley
stayed at a posh Bed and Breakfast, and I slept in the bus out back. We
hit a local watering hole, and I had a couple scotches and sang Frank
Zappa's Dirty Love at a Cowboy Karaoke joint. I could feel the love in
the room.
And to think we almost didn't make it there. On the way to the show a
westy door flew off the roofrack of the bus I was following, spun in the
air like a falling Wallenda, and missed my bus by a few feet. I was
moving at a good enough speed that it would have taken me out had it hit
my windshield. I got the hardware off the door, but the jalousy and
sheet metal were goners.

I hauled a full middle splitty seat up there, only to have Wiley in my
own caravan buy it from me, before the meet even started.

But I saw Clara, B and E, Steven Howell, Craig Spaithe from the Gorge VW
Club,a bunch of non-list riff raff, including Marks Lapriore and Smith,
Rick Crandall ( who had an entire NOS front floor panel, not the corner,
the entire thing with shift rod bracket) Tommy from Rickreall, Chris
&gt;from L-5 vee dub, Logan Gray the book guy, Dawn Smythe and family in
their cool new like-old paintjob panel. I hear I missed Todd Hill, but I
saw Ken Madsen, missed Luke Lukey, but I saw Brian Big-Fooot.

  I picked up a couple huge brand new Hazet screwdrivers, a PLF pop-top
canvas, ( she makes them, best available, not the same crappola as Rocky
Mountain, I don't care what Ron Salmon says. :) ) a dash tray for my
boss' 21 window, a roof rack for a friend who is moving to the east, a
rear-interior light switch that goes on the column for my 65. I sold a
piece of corner window glass and two seals, a steering wheel, the
aforementioned seat, some seat bolts that I bought earlier in the day,
and a boat-load of dirty old carbs and distributors. I gave away a nice
passenger door to a 66 bug.

There was lotsa good junk there, almost bought a cab divider, but dawn
Smythe wanted it worse than I did, almost sold Clara some wheels, but we
are both too &quot;onry&quot; (as they saw in Puallup) to meet in the middle....

Ty Hodges, listee and fellow Corvallian won 2nd place in the camper
division, behind a bubble window. Talk about left handed compliments!
Lots of the normal trailer queens, some interesting stuff, some
watercooled junkola, lotsa lowered buses, and one really nice original
paint red panel in the front parking lot.

Caravan home was uneventful, no flying parts. Looking forward to the
rest of the season.
