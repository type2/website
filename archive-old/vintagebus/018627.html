Subject: Mesh grey stuff wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everybody.
Has anyone got a mesh grey cab divider 3 panel set
lying around they want to sell? Or a mesh grey
passenger door panel?

What about the two top rear corner interior panels for
a 21/13 window bus? or the luggage compartment
beneath-the-window panel for the gas filler/passenger
side?

OR: Does anyone want to by a 13 window deluxe in L.A.
(I think it's a 64 or 65) White/red with a good 1600
DP engine. I think the bus has been rolled, since
there are dents/scrapes all along the top and side
(vandals?).Puncture in driver's side/ bondo evidence.
 But it has goodies like a complete mesh grey interior
w/ back seat kickpanel (no middle seat) washer bottle,
jail bars (not on seat though) pop-outs are good. No
nose emblem, most deluxe trim is good, no rear bumper,
front with trim but no overriders. Cargo doors don't
align due to roll/damage, the seller seems to think it
is restorable, he wants $1200 for it. I offered him
100 for the cab divider and door panel.

Anyone out here want to look at it? I just want the
panels.

67 deluxe &quot;DARTHVW&quot;

ALSO: I have a shifter (sans knob) from a 65 deluxe.
Anyone want it? Free, just pay for shipping.

ALSO: I got those yellowed dash grabhandles and a
shift knob almost looking like new by soaking them
overnight in a 20% bleach/ 80% water solution. They
look really sweet! Now If I can find some endcaps.
Anyone sell just the caps?
