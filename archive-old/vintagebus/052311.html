Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

The thing people forget about the &quot; Parts Whores&quot; is that if it wasn't for
them alot of those busses they found would still be sitting where they were
*rusting* away.  Many of the salvage yards I have gone to looking for busses
say &quot;Yeah we used to have 5 or 6 of them but we crushed them all a few years
ago&quot;  Wish a &quot;Whore&quot; could have made it there first to put a few of those
irreplaceable parts back in circulation.

&gt; being somewhat of an ex-parts &quot;whore&quot;, i made an ok existence scouring the
&gt; country for junkyards to strip cars. i never had the $$ to do the entire
&gt; vehicle thing. some blame must be placed on the internet, obviously, and
&gt; the fact that there just aren't as many anywhere as there were 5 or so
&gt; years ago, not even in junkyards.
