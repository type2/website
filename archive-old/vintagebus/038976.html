&gt; black gold flowing down from
&gt; the fan shrouding and the base of the carb.  Hmmm, my first thought is
&gt; that the seals on the base of the oil cooler are shot.

It sounds like it's coming from the oil cooler; either the seals, or
the oil cooler itself has sprung a leak, or perhaps the flange that holds
the cooler onto the case has broken or come unbolted.

Don't drive it, since it could get a lot worse very suddenly and dump
all the oil.  When you pull the oil cooler, get it tested for leaks if you
plan to reuse it.

When I got my bus, after the harrowing 400mi drive home, I had almost
everything pulled apart for rebuilding or checking.  I noticed that the
base flange on the oil cooler (original non-doghouse style on a 1500)
was broken on the inboard side!  The two outer bolts and the fan shroud
apparently held it in place well enough that it didn't leak enough to
notice!  I figured the grace of St.  Muir had made it last so long, and
installed a doghouse oil cooler.
