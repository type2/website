Wade,

I didnt see the M code of 056 for the locking steering wheel. I would assume 
it could come on the trucks. The one I have came on the 64 westy. If you 
want a picture of it, its at this link.

Here is the Mcode plate that was on the bus.

&gt;Hey list,
&gt;  Finally got my trucks ONLY site up to releasable status (at least i think
&gt;so). Contains pretty much everything for a truck fan. Year to year with
&gt;pics, restoration help, truck m-codes, truck toys, truck literature,
&gt;accessories,etc. Even got some old commercials in wav format. Go check it
&gt;out and lemme know what you guys think, or if you see probs. I tried to 
&gt;make
&gt;it a point not to have pics that other sites have, so most everything you
&gt;see will be new. More to follow as time allows.
&gt;Thanks to the people who &quot;beta tested&quot; my site, including some main 
&gt;listees,
&gt;much appreciated
&gt;Link it on your sites if you like it
&gt;http://www.dropgates_dot_com
