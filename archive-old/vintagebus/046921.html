Subject: '59 Crew cab Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Any guru's out there with old VW manuals?  Would like to know the date VW 
first made their crew cab (as opposed to Binz making the crew cab)  Would 
like the Date and chassis number if available.  I couldn't find it in my 
Progressive Refinements.

Thanks,
Dan
