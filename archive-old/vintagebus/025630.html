Well, I lied.  I just found the NEATO booklet and on page 34 they state the
following

&quot;    A42 Standard SO42 interior, no exterior fitments
      B42 Standard SO42 interior, pop-up top, side tent and roof rack
      C42 Standard SO42 interior, pop-up top
      D42 Standard SO42 interior, side tent and roof rack  &quot;

Also stated

&quot; Westfalia Campers were prefixed with an SO code in the main dealer catalogue of
model options and variations.  The SO code referred to the standard interior
layout and fitments for a particular model, alternative or additional fitments
could also be specified by customers in any SO camper.  Option M108 refers to the
standard SO42 interior, with M80-82, M183 or M184 to indicate walkthrough models.
There are also some specific codes for the SO42 models which appear on the &quot;M&quot;
plate, these indicate exterior optional fitments as listed&quot;

Cool book if you don't have it.  Get it from NEATO
