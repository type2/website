Hi Eric,
Best to install a 6 volt 200mm FW instead so you can keep your 6 volt starter 
with a 12 volt solinoid.  This setup really gets going in the morning even 
during the winter.  Also it allows you to walk the bus on battery power in 
first gear for several blocks evem up slight hills if your engine just stops 
running on you in a busy traffic area.  You can have a shop install a 6 volt 
ring gear onto the 12 volt FW you ruined.  Anywhich way you go it does not 
hurt to have the FW balanced and probably a real good idea if a new ring gear 
is installed.  We can tell when the heavy side of the FW (Wit stocker or CW 
crank) is aligned with the heavy side of the pressure plate!   To avoid this 
one must make sure the lightening drilled holes in the stocker balanced FW 
and pressure plate are about 90 degrees from each other. 
  Next engine we rebuild we are going to have a shop balance the FW, CW crank 
and pressure plate together.  From what we hear cost will be about $60.00.
