Be careful, the left over steel particles from the steel wool WILL RUST
were ever it is left.
You can get stainless steel wool, brass, or synthetics type
Be very careful to clean areas were you do not want rust stains  (bus,
car, driveway, etc.)

, but some guys wet &quot;sand&quot; it
&gt; with 0000 steel wool.  Rips the stuff right off, but it doesn't hurt the
&gt; glass.  Watch the paint (especially corners) when you're doing it...maybe
&gt; tape them off?  Good luck,
