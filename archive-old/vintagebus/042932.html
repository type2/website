Subject: bent rim from pothole!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.30.0104090131120.2278-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


A while back I was driving the treacherous Hwy 95 (Idaho's goat trail) in
the dark and because my headlights aren't the best in the world and I was
cruizin' and a cool 60mph I couldn't help but hit a pothole really hard!
I didn't think much of it at the time, but when I got to my destination I
imediately noticed that my right rear rim was severely bent (so much that
the tire was starting to go flat) and my hubcap was gone!  I still can't
believe I didn't notice that right away after I hit the darn thing!  I
ended up pounding out the bend and having the wheel/tire balanced at the
local tire shop and everything was cool.

Moral of the story:  Watch out
for those nasty potholes, because they bite hard!!!
