Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 Double Cab... 07-30-03

&gt;I remember the wolf, he just did it with his fingers in his mouth, 
&gt;is this item something you blow into or is it electromechanical or 
&gt;something?

Yeah, it's an electric horn. They've got air horns that do the same 
thing as well...and they're much nicer...and more expensive. Mine's 
cheesy, but effective.

I've got a big red button mounted on the dash in place of the ash 
tray. I had the button in my stash and it just seemed right.
