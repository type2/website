Hi,

Thanks for the responses. I shoulda looked at the pn for the later signals
too. Is it common for a part that superseded another to inherit most of the
original's pn? 

&gt; but if you read the search by part number bit in the busdepot 
&gt; website, it 
&gt; says enter no suffix letters, just the 9 digit p/n and it 
&gt; will bring up 
&gt; everything that fits.   what comes up when you type in that 
&gt; p/n is the B 
&gt; version- fried eggs.  listed with the B suffix and it says 
&gt; used on 62-67.    
&gt; they do not have the pointy yellow lens listed in the catalog
&gt;
