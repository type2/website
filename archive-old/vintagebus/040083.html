  I went out to pay the storage on my 65 today and thought I would check on 
the bus while I was there,tried to find some #s to find out what else its 
missing etc...Whenever im there I always go lokk at the old Kombi that sis 
in the opposite corner of the lot,its got a bit of rust but is all there.So 
on my way out I notice 2 Ghias and 2 914's sitting in a little group,never 
saw these here before I thought and looked them over,pretty bad shape!So i 
figure I better head home since I was freezing my arse off. I hop in the 
nice warm New Beetle with heated seats and head out,then I notice another 
bus,this definatley was'nt here a month ago.I hop out to check it out and 
its a late 60's sundial in solid shape ,Then I notice another one stuffed in 
front of it,67 13 window deluxe!
Safe to say i was a little excited,considering I have seen one other splitty 
in the 7 months I have lived up here.
  Both of the buses where loaded with parts,the deluxe had pieces of camper 
interior stacked in it,and the sundial was loaded up also,bumpers,extra 
panels etc.there was a pile of bumpers sitting between the two of them,some 
had deluxe trim and all where a hell of a lot nicer than mine.
I decided I should ask the owner of the storage who they belong to ,but he 
couldnt tell me.This sucks!I am dying tring to find parts and almost 
evrything I need was found today and I dont know who they belong to!If I 
wasnt a nicer person I could have loaded my car and been set!Oh well 
hopefully when I get mine out on the road I wiil run into this lucky 
person,we all seem to find each other some how!
