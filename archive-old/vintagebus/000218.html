Subject: [VB] Next Kelly Park on April 16, 2000?

SHORT: 
Is next Kelly Park on April 16, 2000?

LONG: 
I am planning a trip to the Bay Area of CA, and I wanted to go at a time when 
a splitty bus event was happening.  As far as I can tell, the next 
subjectively notable event will be Kelley Park in April of 2000.  Is there an 
earlier event?  Anyway I just want to confirm the date for Kelley Park 
(Golden Gate Chapter, Vintage Volkswagen Club of America, 16th Annual Car 
Show and Swap Meet at San Jose Historical Museum, San Jose, CA) .  I checked 
Jack's VW Planet, NEATO, Type2_dot_com (link to events is not up), Volkswebbin, 
even Golden Gate's page, and the list archives, but all I came up with is 
this (nice) site: http://members.aol_dot_com/OurVWs/events.html which lists 
Kelley park as April 16, 2000.  Is this correct?  Also this is a thank you to 
Page &amp; Peggy Nicholson for maintaining a nice events page :)
