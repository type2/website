Subject: Buses and Balloons

Thanks to the Albuquerque crowd for a great time. The hospitality was
greatly appreciated, I hated to be such a bother. Watching the balloons take
off in the morning was a really pleasant experience. Less pleasant were the
helicopters hovering overhead that woke me up in plenty of time to see them
but that is my fault for not drinking enough at night. A nice turnout, fun
show and well worth the trip. I would have to say that this has to be the
highest concentration of listees of any show I've been to, by percentages
anyway. Couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting one, even if a lot of them
are lurkers. The elusive president of NEATO was even there for awhile.
Stopped by and checked out the Bus Co-op where JP and Barry have one of the
neatest setups around. Maybe someday.....

1045 miles round trip on the clock, averaged 16 mpg. Pretty good. About the
farthest I've traveled without towing something and it really makes a
difference. I figure I should just about triple that figure by the end of
the month what with Pomona, OCTO and a trip to Havasu at the end of the
month. The drive really is as much fun as the campouts, and if you don't
think so you're doing it wrong.
