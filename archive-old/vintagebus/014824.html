Subject: Gas Heaters for sale

Hello All,

I have two Gas Heaters that were part of recent trade.  They scare me so I 
am going to sell them.  One is an Ebersparcher BN4 and the other is a 
Stewart Warner.  I would take 150 for either of them or 250 for both.  As 
they have both been out of busses for a while they probably need to be gone 
over before use. I don't know what they are really worth so these prices are 
negotiable.  I would gladly trade them both for a set of Westy curtains.

Boyd Smith
