i was flipping through a vw mag a couple of weeks ago, and i saw (i
think it was the 8th?) jerome jamboree covered in that one.

back when Salt City Air Coolers put on a couple of vw shows in utah, we
got covered in it (just one page i think) and we didn't do anything with
hotels or anything.  are the mags starting to expect this kind of stuff
nowadays?  if so, well, that just sucks.

&gt; I thought it was just me!!!!!!!  But someone else noticed that they repeat
&gt; the same old **** every so often.  Sort of a cycle.  I haven't bought a mag
&gt; in some time now.  If I want to read something, I'll just  go pick an older
&gt; issue from my collection dating back to the early '80's.  It's better reading
&gt; than the most recent ones I bought a few months back.
&gt; 
&gt; As for Jerome Jamboree coverage:  back when Pat Kelly was Pres. of the ABC,
&gt; he was specifically told by one (or both) of the magazines that they require
&gt; hotels and transportation furnished by the event promoter!  Whether this
&gt; still holds true or not I couldn't say.  As has been mentioned, these
&gt; magazines are something like a few Phoenix radio stations:  revolving doors
&gt; for anyone and everyone to pass through.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my &quot;FWIW&quot;,
