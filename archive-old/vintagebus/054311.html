Subject: Re: [VB] Vehicle registration in Calif

Consider yourself lucky.  I was informed at my local office (CHP) that
they only checked VINs one day a week for one hour that specific day.
Be there or else if you make an appointment!  It was some odd ball time
like 2:30 on a Thursday.  BTW get there 1/2 hour before the appointed
hour!

OK jumped through the hoops, and they said bring it around back.  I did
and they had me pull it up on to ramps in a stall.  Then, they said
leave.  &quot;What?&quot; I said.  Yup.  Go out to the lobby and we'll call you.
Looked at me really strange too.  Guess they were expecting some hippie
(no offense to the hippies on the list ;-) instead of a tall white goof
ball.  Didn't find the drugs they were looking for either.

The kicker was the duffas got the number wrong and I had to end up
straightening up things with DMV later anyway.

&gt; Be nice and call your local CHP office and ask for the officer

&gt; I called the local CHP office, talked a bit to this officer and
&gt; arranged a time for him to come out to my house to check the bus.
&gt;
&gt; He arrived on time, nice, polite, and very knowledgeable about VIN
&gt; locations.  He knew where to look on my '66.  These folks are
&gt; usually the old car nuts on the force, and love checking out old
&gt; vehicles.  It provides a break on checking resurrected junkers
&gt; at wrecking yards.
&gt;
&gt; I bought and sold the bus without ever even getting an engine
&gt; installed, so there was no way for me to drive it to the DMV.
&gt;
&gt; So, call you local CHP office for assistance in verifying the ID.
&gt;
&gt; Jeff  busless, wishing I had kept the '66

&gt; According to the DMV: If the vehicle ID is not in their database, you
&gt; will need to bring the vehicle to the DMV so they can verify the ID.
