Mine are tight as all get out. First thought it was
rust:( Had to take em off, put em in a vise &amp; tap em
to move the arm. after a while they &quot;semi&quot; loosened
up. (truck is very low miles, maybe gates not used
much) I also found that you can slightly bent them to
keep the gates from rattling. Dont think it would work
if they were loose.
