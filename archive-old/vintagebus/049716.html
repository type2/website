&gt;The socket you need is 42mm or 1-5/8&quot;.  I just wrote an article for NEATO's

Hmmmm,

I haven't seen anyone contradicting this 42mm claim, but I think it should
be 41mm. I've done several redux box rebuilds and the socket I use for the
inner axle nut is a 41mm (at least on big nut trannies).

A 42mm socket may loosen this nut, but it is not the correct size and could
slip and damage the nut (which should be replaced anyway, as you &quot;damage&quot;
it when you lock it by hitting the shoulder into a groove that rbns across
the threads). I would suggest that unless you are going for a similar
imperial size, get the correct 41mm socket.

Kombi spec)
plus another two 1975 Fleetline buses and one panelvan, and a 1966
German-built SA-assembled panelvan, all in varying stages of decomposition.
