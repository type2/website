I need a 58 engine lid . This is 1 year only, flat with no center brakelight
hole. Anyone coming to Buses By the Bridge 3 that has one please email me. I
have a perfect center
brakelight lid that I will trade or buy outright, hate to weld up that
center hole. I do have the 58 only lin. lite holder and brkt so its ok if
that is missing. Does anyone have any info on Camper America camper
conversions? I'm picking up a 67 C.A. camper today and
would I some info on them. This is the camper with the big picture window on
the drivers side. Anyone needing BBB3 info email me or ronnie for a flier.
Latest addition to the huge raffle is a Rancho 3:88 Bus Freeway Flier Trans.
Hope to see you in HAVASU!!!

John Howard
