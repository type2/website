 hello,
  could you direct me on the installation of a 12 volt
 starter onto a 1966 tranny. the engine and flywheel
 are built for a 1967 tranny and starter.
 thank you so much for your assistance.
 e.s.
  &gt;&gt;
if the bus 6V still.   If so you want to put the 6V solinoid on the 12V 
starter.  

In any case you want to have the correct starter bushing.  one that has the 
inner Diameter for the 12V starter and the outer diameter for your trans, 
which is probably for the 6V.  you can buy these for a couple bucks. tap it 
into the trans.  grease the shaft of the start where it goes into the 
bushing, and install the starter.  

you have to grind out (clearance) the bellhousing for the slightly larger 12V 
fly wheel  Use a grinder.  test install the motor, turn the engine round, 
hear grinds, it doesn't go in all the way?  great, pull it out- see the 
marks- thats where you need to grind a little more

although it is not impossible that it has already been clearanced.
