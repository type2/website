Some time ago there was someone out there that was willing to swipe his
buses European headlights with the American ones from my bus. Is that
person still interested? Let me know. Also I'll need front bumper for my
'64 bus. I would prefer DeLuxe but would live with anything. I want to
take the funky one off. Thank you.
