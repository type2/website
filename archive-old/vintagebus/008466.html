I've been wanting to post this message for 48 hours but just didn't have the
time.  I hope I can still remember everything.  The past 2 days have been so
hectic...you'll see why in a moment.

Monday evening after work I picked up my rear drums from the local FLAPS.
For 6 bucks each, they turned them for me and the kid said they were the
truest set of drums he'd ever run on the machine.  He told me the first pass
on each drum was to take off the lip.  One drum required one main pass and
totally cleaned up and the other one required 2 passes and it was fine.
Adam (the guy's name) said that he's used to old drums coming in and having
to be turned repeatedly and leaving the store in questionable shape.  After
lugging them home, I did what Ronnie suggested and sprayed the toxic brake
cleaning fluid on them.  I also used Comet and hot water and scrubbed the
living hell out of them.  When I was all done, they passed the Ronnie test.
(When you spray them down, the cleaning fluid should come off just as clear
as when it left the can...) :-)

However, before I finished the 2nd drum (it was now about 7 to 7:30), Mom
rolls in the driveway from taking her friend to the doctor for a checkup AND
I also the sound of a VW engine.  It was a young couple in a 71 Camper (not
a Westy for sure - some other kind of a camper conversion with no poptop. I
was a bit perplexed as any listees that stop by have always called first or
let me know they were coming.  It turns out, my Mom had gotten behind them
on the highway on her way back from the doctor's office.  For 20 miles she
drove their pace until they came to a stoplight here in town.  Mom waved at
them and gave them the thumb's up, then got out of the car, knocked on their
window (this is at a stoplight remember) and she just blurts out, &quot;Hey - my
son is restoring an old VW bus - if you want to see it, follow me!&quot; and then
she runs back to the car, dancing in time to the horns and middle fingers of
traffic that see a green light but can't move. :-)

And so they followed.

So here I am meeting a couple of VW nuts, who are on internet but aren't
aware of any VW lists, A.I.R.S. groups, online worldwide comraderie
assistance, or anything like that.  Man I had my work cut out out for me
(the plugger that I am.)

Turns out that Mark and Maurine we're having some minor bus problems and
just happened to pass thru town.  Here's the story:

Mark is a DeVry graduate that travels and lives all over the U.S. with his
job.  On a whim to meet up with an ex-girlfriend, he bought an old VW van
(still had instransits on it)  in Idaho (where he currently lives) and
headed for Omaha, NE where Maurine would fly from Phoenix, AZ to meet him.
After Mark got to Omaha, the bus died and they spent 2 days there with what
turned out to be a bad coil.  They were enroute to Illinois for a big
buffalo burger festival that Mark's dad holds and is increasing in size
every year.  This year's guest comedian was Goober from the Andy Griffeth
show.  Unfortuately, the bus didn't get them there so Maurine and Mark
decided to rekindle the flame and drive in this old bus back to Phoenix.
Maurine will keep the bus, Mark will fly home, and in March of '00, will
reunite with Maurine and the 71 VW in Phoenix.  They are both young 'uns -
both being about 25/26 years old.

Mark has a good technical background he told me but is not too VW
mechanically inclined.  He stopped for assistance in Rock Springs, WY where
a learned mechanic told him about testing plug wires for proper resistance.
Then another mechanic in Omaha helped him with his coil problem.  What Mark
and Maurine needed right now was a break.  They were planning on camping at
the park overnight when my Mom intercepted at the stoplight.  So when I
offered to let them roll up in the driveway next to my 66 so we could get to
work on the bus and offered them camp space in the backyard or in the house
as well as food, they were so thankful yet shocked because of these total
strangers putting trust in them and wanting to help them.  It's the VW
family.

While Mom and Maurine got the ball rolling with the laundry and the
orientation of the house, Mark and I buckled down and did a ton of stuff to
his bus.  First off was the idle problem - no idle.  I put Mark to the task
of removing the the 34-pict-3, telling him to label stuff so he could
remember where it went.  When I asked if he had a 13 mil, he said he had a
1/2&quot; - I knew this guy was not as totally deft as he claimed to be. :-)  We
did a quickie cleaning job on the carb, did full blown oil change (complete
with oil screen cleaning and gasket kit), set the timing and dwell to specs.
We also found out that his choke didn't work (it was running rich when he
backed into the driveway - stung my eyes pretty bad.)  So I disabled the
choke for now and told him the bus will run like crap for about 10 minutes
before it settles down (which he confirmed later was pretty much right.)
During all of this hubbub, 2 of the neighborhood kids came by and wanted to
check out my bus and ended up seeing double, and then Roy (the guy
responsible for my VW addiction 7 years ago) came over and needed some
advice on where to get some parts.  We hit the RMMW catalog and got a parts
list made for him.

When Mark and I were just about done, it was 11:30 and then I noticed a bad
thing under the bus.  I've never seen anything like this before - his CV
boots were damn near gone on the passenger side axle inside and out.  The
driver's side was fine.  I told Mark that he was going nowhere until that
was fixed - I mean I was looking inside the CV with no trouble at all!!!
Mark knew the seriousness of the situation and was wondering where he was
going to get an oddball CV boot for a 71 bus.  His jaw fell in shock when I
procured one (left over from when I had my 71 Westy 'Oxcart').  So we
started removing the drive axle - PITA!  The hex bolts were frozen and I
skinned my knuckles but in about 25 minutes, I got it removed.  We still
needed another boot so using the flange from the old CV joint, we went out
to the shed and dug through my pile of drive axles and found a bug boot in
decent shape.  After cutting the flange off, Mark found out the bug boot fit
inside the bus flange rather nicely.  Permatex to the recue!
So to cut to the chase, I totally cleaned and greased a rear drive axle for
a 71 Camper at 11:30 at night - not getting totally done until 2:15 in the
morning and to bed at 3:15.  4 hours of sleep and it was off to work.  That
was hard!

Mark and Maurine were so appreciative of my efforts and that of rest of the
family.  What went thru my mind is repeatedly is that I know I have the same
kind of friends here on the list and when I head to California in my bus, I
can totally expect the same treatment from them as I was able to do, lending
credence to the fact that in order to have friends, you must be one.

Yesterday about 11:30 in the morning, Mark and Maurine showed up at work
with a case of oil and a can of engine degreaser and thanked me repeatedly.
They took a couple of pictures and promised me a some reprints once they're
developed.  I didn't get a chance to take photos as it was either dark or I
was too tired.  Mark I did manage a little 10 minute guitar jamming session
that night and that was fun.  He's 2 years into it and plays better than me.
:-)  Also, in another odd coincidence, Maurine is on dialysis and so is my
Mom's friend that she took to Lincoln that day.  Mom is a Medical Records
Transcriptionist and Maurine's mother is.  So it was one big ball of
conincidences - one right after the other - that netted me a couple of good
VW friends.  Mark said he'll plan on attending the Buffalo Burger thing in
Illinois next year at this time and he'll make our house one of the camping
stops along the way.  I would of course, expect nothing less.

One more note before closing - Mark had a solor panel on a homemade rack on
the top of his bus.  He charges 2 6v batteries during the day, and then
using an invertor at night, powers his burner, coffee pot, and AC light in
his bus.  It's the DeVry man in him. :-)  Also, in another coincidence, his
bus is the same color mine was and even had some similar interior features
(though some parts were missing like the closet and sink.)  Instead of
having Jalousie windows, his camper had a setup much like a patio door has
although of course small enough to fit in the window area on a bus.  You
could either close the glass thereby closing the screen, or slide it open
and still have glass to see out of but a now-open screen for ventilation.

They should arrive in Phoenix today if my mechanical work is up to par.
