Subject: getting my transmission fixed - finally!

Hey there busfolks,
So...  my transmission has been leaking copiously and the reduction boxes
spitting out bits of bearing for a good long time now.  My dad has a friend
who is a transmission rebuilder and willing to fix it.  Yay!  So, I have to
pull the transmission and take it to him to rebuild, I guess.

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on things the rebuild guy might
need to know, as he's not familiar with old vw's at all.  I am planning to
photocopy the section of the manual that deals with the transmission (they
have one at the library, which lists Kenneth Ball as the author; i only have
the idiot book) but I don't know how much help that will be.  Hopefully
it'll be ok, I'm really excited about getting it fixed finally.

Diana
