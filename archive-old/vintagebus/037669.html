Subject: Re: [VB] 6V Radio  on 12 V

&gt;  I just bought a 6V Radio Becker that was in a deluxe split in France, and i
&gt;  want to know if i just have to add a resistor on my 12 V system to work !!
&gt;  
&gt;  mike !!

  The radio in my bug has a switch on the back for 6V or 12V. I know they are 
not the same but you might get lucky and have one on yours. You might be able 
to get something from Radio Quack that will work. 
  I would agree with Clara that you need something besides a volt-a-drop.
