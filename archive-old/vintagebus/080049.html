Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

Hi Dave,
Eberspacher did that in 1968-71 buses by putting on a plastic tube from the 
fan end of thier gas heater in the engine compartment and the other end of this 
tube to the rear spare tire depression where multiple holes drilled through 
to allow air from the interior of the bus to be recirculated.
