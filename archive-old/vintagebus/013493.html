&gt; injuries - broken knees, elbows and forearms, with the occ. steering 
&gt; wheel

Every one should learn to drive(ride) a motorcycle and after that
graduate to a vw only after 5 years. After making the jump from bike to
cars I still drive parinoid style, like I'm invisable.
laters,

ps 
I don't recommend lane splitting in a type2.
