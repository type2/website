Well i finally go around to pulling my engine today, It is always such a pain
in the fingers/hand trying to remove the two top bolts, especially the one
above the solenoid. It is like i need to eb a contortionist or
something...anyway when i got ot the clutch it had oil all over it. Need to
get a new clutch kit installed, it appears as though the front engine seal was
leaking...i just replcaed this last summer. I don't remember where it was
manuf. but i remember someone did a visual comparison of the different
seals(based on country of origin) Does anyone remember which country made the
best...which ones to avoid. 

Any ideas as to why this seal would break, did i just install it improperly
last summer?

better...
