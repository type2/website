Subject: Re: [VB] M/C on '67

Raymond, the pics look as the stock pedal pan will not fit with mod  larger 24mm
piston 71-79 style
master cylinder with an adapter kit and how about filling the two break
reservoirs now?

&gt; I bit the bullet on mine and upgraded to the larger 24mm piston 71-79 style
&gt; master cylinder with an adapter kit from local VW store. BFY or I, whatever,
&gt; out of the VW Trends and Hot VW mags sells the adaptr kit for $39.95. I
&gt; bought the new master cylinder for $43.00 and had it all bolted in my SC in
&gt; 20 minutes. The brake lines on my dual circuit 67 matched exactly with the
&gt; new master cylinder and the only other change was to lengthen the wires the
&gt; the farthest brake light switch. I even took pics, go to vintagebus_dot_com and
&gt; click on the gallery and the single cab catagory and my master cylinder mod
&gt; pictures are on section 5 about the middle of the page. Good luck.
