The message from Dave about an 0.82 4th gear
sounds pretty good, but there is something else to
consider.

The speed of your bus does not signify the amount
of air blowing over your cylinders.  VW made the
bus this slow because of this problem.  They
considered all of the main uses for the vehicle
and made the tranny to suit.

Gene Berg did a lot of research in this field
also.  He found that a 0.77 4th gear was not right
for a bug or bus.  The engine would not turn fast
enough to get the air it needs to stay cool.

Now you want to go 15 mph faster than it was made
for, AND spin 500-1000 less rpm....it just won't
work (or won't work for long).  Spinning the
engine fast won't solve anything either.  I think
Gene figured out that at 4000 rpm, the fan is
blowing as much air as it can over the cylinders. 
So even at 4,500 rpm, the same amount of air is
cooling the engine, even with all that extra heat.

I run a 3.88 r&amp;p with the .089 4th in my stock 67
(1600cc SP, 195/75R14).  It will go 80 if I push
it.  But loaded up with camping gear and a full
roof rack, I'm lucky to get 65 (downhill,
windstorm).  Hills are a nightmare too.

Wanna go faster?  My 911 crew cab goes 105 in 4th
gear (still haven't maxed out 5th gear).  Only
costs about $7-10,000 for the conversion, and I
have yet to reach 200 degrees oil temp in it.
