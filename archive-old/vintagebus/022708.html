Subject: Re: [VB] Generator paint?
Mime-Version: 1.0

The new one (as in built by Bosch in '98) I bought had a thin layer of
protecting oil only...Clearcoat sounds like a good idea but I wonder if
they were left unpainted for some kind of heat dissipation factor?

Ben
&gt;
&gt;But then I thought, I wonder if they are clear-coated for rust protection
&gt;with something?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
