Subject: Re: [VB] got my first split, questions

I had a bug that did about the same thing when I tried to drive it.  It
ended up being that one of the spark plugs had blown a hole in the head, and
wasn't seating properly.  I'm not saying this is your problem, but it
probably is only running on 3 cylinders.  I would pull a spark plug wire
from each cylinder and see if it changes the way the engine runs.  If you
find one that it doesn't change, that's the culprit.  It could be simple
like a tune up, or major like a valve.  Also, when doing 47mph does it sound
like the engine is over revving?  It also could be a bad cluth/pressure
plate, but you would be able to hear that.

Later
Charles
