Subject: Time switch for heater

Wouldn't a wind up timer switch commonly used for 110v AC work? Some have 12 
hours, others 2 or so. They have a dial, pointer and are spring operated. Find 
'em at a hardware store. Be careful using AC equipment for DC, it's not as robust as DC devices.
 
Might be better to figure out the Bay switch, you'll be smarter when you do.

&gt; So does anyone know of any sort of switch that has a timer built in
&gt; that I can use to control my gas heater? I have a late bay timer
&gt; switch, however this thing is quite a bear to understand.
