Subject: 36 hp Fan Shroud Question

List:

I was told today that there are several different 36 hp fan shrouds, i.e. different wire clips, etc., depending on what production year the bus is.  I always thought a 36 hp fan shroud was a 36 hp fan shroud.

If there are differences, please enlighten me, and the list, what they are.  My '59 bus was built in 11/58 so I'd love to know *which* fan shroud I should be looking for.  And BTW, if anyone has a ding/dent free 36 hp fan shroud with all the clips intact that is correct for my year, I'd be interested in buying it if you're interested in selling it.

TIA.

Robert
