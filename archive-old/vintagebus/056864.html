&gt; Well, found the floats was a) set to high, as the 30pict3, required 1.5 mm 
&gt; of shimming, and I had one .5 shim. B) Float was unreliable, as it stuck on 
&gt; brass road that it pivots on. At first I considered the brass rod should 
&gt; pivot in the slots for it in the carb, but this is not guaranteed.
&gt; When my float was working, some gas was making it's way into the carb, 
&gt; flooding engine after a run.  After I screwed up the float worse, it 
&gt; flooded constantly, or I go no gas in her at all.
&gt; Needle valve seems to work fine, it must be fuel level and float action.

Hi Al,
Hmm, could be your float is just too heavy.  We had that happen to our 63 SC 
and after going through the fuel pump and cabr we just replaced the float and 
all was well.

&gt; Fuel pump Q: Is there some internal check mechanism? To stop fuel while NOT 
&gt; pumping? It is a brosol no rebuildable. A rebuildable Brazillian one is on 
&gt; its way in case. The pump produces ~3psi-3.2psi at idle. No noticible drop 
&gt; below 2.9-3.0.  A cheapo regulator is temp there, set with gauge to make 
&gt; certain we are not going above three.
&gt; With the fuel pump disconnected from carb, no fuel continually runs from 
&gt; gravity, so it appears as nothing is 'passing through' if this is at all 
&gt; possible.

The fuel should be shut off by the valves in the fuel pump, but if not the 
shut off valve in the carb is the last defense against the fuel fillling the 
engine when the gas tank in buses (Not in SCs due to gas tank postioned lower 
than the carb!) are more than half full.

&gt; Would this ential that my problems have been largely float height and float 
&gt; action then? Or shall I attack the fuel pump in some other way? I do intend 
&gt; to check rod height, but psi seems ok.

We have seen fuel pumps with a leak in the diaphram squirt fuel directly into 
the engine case.  This is best found out by unbolting the fuel pump from the 
engine case and hand pumping it with a screwdriver to see if fuel leaks out 
the bottom.

&gt; I really need this bus to move soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Revamped the carb with 116 main, 65 pilot, 125 air correction (yes I want 
&gt; to find a 128-135), and I believe when float level is correct, the main can 
&gt; be inspected to increase further.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the affect of a SLIGHTLY low float level? I now have the Beetle 
&gt; Bentley manual, which has specs for this carb, thank goodness.

Slightly low float level probably would cause the shut off valve not to 
close.

&gt; One last q, does the float pin retaining clip u shape go toward the front of 
&gt; the car, in line with the curve of the gasket, or towards the rear, where 
&gt; it seems more capapble of interfering with things?

According to our Bentley manual exploded diagram of the 30 PICT-3 carb should 
have the curve pointing rearward.
