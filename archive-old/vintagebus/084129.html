Subject: Weird occurrence with turn signal?

My latest electrical gremlin that I tried to wrestle, but was pinned. Now it is time to go to the ropes and tag up with someone. My right turn signal and brake light works only with the headlights off. Once I turn the headlights on, the right turn signal and brake lights do not work. When they are turned on the dash light just stays on. I took the whole taillight housing apart,cleaned it, made sure that the spring were good, put new terminal ends on and replaced some of the ground wires and soldered some connections. The bulb itself did seem to be a little loose because the slightest touch would affect it's connectivity and make it either go out or  flicker. My solution to that was to wrap the bulbs male end with a small strip of aluminium foil to make it a little snug. Finally I topped all connections off with some dielectric grease. Still the turn signal acts as before. Has anybody had this problem before? Oh yeah, I checked the wiring schematic too and all was good there.

The only other weird electrical gremlin that I have (which really doesn't bother me) is that my 63 bus will not shut off, with key turned off,  until the the brake pedal is up and headlights are off. Thanks for any help
