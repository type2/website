I think I'm going to have to side with eric &amp; barb on this one. To me my bus
has always been the original exploration vehicle. Long before the advent of
the modern suv owner who has to use lockers to go over a curb, my busses and
me have enjoyed the ghost towns of the mojave and nevada deserts treading
where 4x4s feared.This meant forget a vw shop, no shops for several hundred
miles, your on your own bud. The moral here is, if you've got it with you, ya
got peace of mind, I think my bus just felt better knowing we could take care
of ourselves.
