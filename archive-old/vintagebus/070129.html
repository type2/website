Subject: BYOB stuff

  Went to adjust my valves last night for the trek to BYOB. #2 Exhaust was 
tight (-.004&quot;) and no adjustment left. I see new head, valves, and/or seats in 
my future. For now I am going to check the pushrod when I get home from work to 
make sure it isn't bent and if not shim the rockers *sigh*. Heads will come off 
for some R&amp;R when we get back.
  Reminder- if your camping to bring some earplugs. No not for Rubber Johnny, 
for the semis and their liberal application of the jake brake not 100 yards 
away. If you need some come see me. I will have extras for our immediate 
neighbors in case the 1.5 year old and the .5 year old have a rough nite.
  Saturday I'll have my German postcards, paper models and New Westfalia 
interior lenses (hot off the former) for sale! Stop by and say &quot;Hi&quot;
