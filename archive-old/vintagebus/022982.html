The last such meet that I went to, I was both surprised and dismayed.
Surprised that it was such a well organized, thought-out event.  Not that
that was surprising, but I didn't know that people were going to try that
hard.  I was dismayed that I was unable to be a part of it.  Other than
where and when to show up, I had no information about the event, nobody had
asked me for help in any fashion.  I'm a NEATO member (I even pre-paid for
3 years), but I don't know if I'm a member of the Sacramento Samba Society.
 I would have *assumed* so.  I've never received a single phone call,
email, or passenger pigeon delivery about any Northern California NEATO
events.  Come to think of it, it's been a long time (a year?) since I've
received a current newsletter.  SSS seems to communicate (from what I can
tell) slowly by word of mouth, and since I usually don't get the
opportunity to hang out with these people, I'm nowhere near the right mouths.

If you don't ask, they can't say &quot;yes&quot;
