Subject: Re: [T2] two weld q's, one spec to DC

stevo sends:

&gt; hi listees, kelly,  - welding questions: i have a stress crack i'd like to
&gt; nip and wonder what would be the best welding method to repair it. two
&gt; inches, passenger side door, above the side mirror. i've heard a braze
&gt; would be best, but a neighbor has oxy acetylene and is glad to do it. i'm
&gt; unsure that might be too hot.

Hmmm...the real choice here is between oxyacetylene fusion welding and
brazing, since most brazing is done with oxyacetylene as heat. I have a
feeling you don't have access to a MIG or TIG setup, and you definitely
don't want to try this with a stick welder.

If your neighbor's real good at sheet-metal welding, I'd go that way.
