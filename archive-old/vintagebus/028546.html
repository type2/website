Subject: [VB] acid etch primer Q

&lt;&lt;I'm just using regular bondo filler,&gt;&gt;

Mike,

Don't know about the acid etched primer, though I used it over some
bondo and it didnt seem to affect anything.

But, for the same price as regular Bondo, you can go to a good auto body
supply and pick up the Bondo with the fiberglass reinforcing fibers. It
is much stronger and well worth the difference in price. . . he he.

Les
