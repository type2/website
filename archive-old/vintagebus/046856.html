&lt;&lt;  But I like to buy lock washers too. The kind with a 
 grip, you know, not a split washer, but a &quot;notched&quot; washer. This works 
 for me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
We like to use the split lock washers and VW suggested these for all of thier
pre-1968 buses for when reinstalling the tranny reduction gear boxes.  Another
reason for locking washers instead of locking tab set up that were used on the
1955-63 buses, is you can get a torque wrench in there and check tightness
when ever you want with out having to bend back those locking tabs.    Eric &amp;
