Subject: RE: [VB] 46mm to 36mm RGBs?  Plus random tranny ?s

That would be great if it is the R&amp;P and not just 4th gear ratio that
changes.  If it is the R&amp;P then the whole gear ratio will move up or down
depending on the R&amp;P selected.

Anyone done this at home before?

Thanks,
Adrian

From what I understand, the &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; Trannys
just have a higher ring and pinion gear. So each gear
comes out a bit higher...i think it's not too hard for
someone good with tranny skills to take your stock
gearbox, and turn it into a freeway flyer. anyone know
who does this? am i totally wrong?
