Subject: RE: [VB] Burnt Clutch??

OK,
I can't drive new cars, I hate those hydralic clutches that are real short,
never pick up off the floor, are like toggel switches, and take a ninja to
modulate.
I burnt a escorts real bad, a 5 speed 95 with a 1.8, fryed it real good.
gShould stayed in my truck or the ghia, but the gf was sick and I had to
drive her escort.
The glaze comes off, but if you smoke it super bad, it might chatter in 3
and 4 when you give it lots o gas up a hill or to punch it, since the
pressure plate is nice and shiny too. You can get it off the disc with
relatively normal use, but the plate stays funny for a long time, the escort
is stil just staring to ditch the chatter.
I would see how it is in time, before tearing her out, unless it's old and
you wanna do the job anyway.
In the mean, I stay in the old cars..Cable clutches, aghhhhh.
Al

&gt; Hi Scott,
&gt; If you just glazed the clutch disc it will come off in a week or two of
&gt; carefull driving.  If you over heated the clutch pressure plate it will
not,
&gt; though usually if the pressure plate was toasted it affects all gears
&gt; especially third and fourth on even slight hills.

Could you elaborate on this 3rd &amp; 4th a little? affects how? what
symptoms?
permeate or non?

Aloha
