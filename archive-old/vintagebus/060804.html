Subject: Tin pieces and pully question. 1965 1500 motor

I am trying to make my motor in my 65 Deluxe more
correct.  Anyone have a rear tin piece with the fresh
air tube (from the oil cooler) hole on the left side?
(looking at the engine from the rear of the bus)

I also am looking for the clip that holds it in place
as it goes in front of the pully.  

Also, what is the correct size for the main pully for
this year?  what timing marks would have been on it? 
Anyone have one?

thanks
Matt
