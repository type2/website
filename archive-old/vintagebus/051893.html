&gt; 
&gt; We are at Ronnie's checking out the shop and the show is over&gt;!!!  keith
&gt; won some mud flaps and Kevin won the Rancho Transmission but they don't
&gt; know it as they left before the show raffle was over.  I am having the
&gt; trannie shipped to my house and Kevin you owe me for the shipping!
&gt; Getting ready to drive the 21 window sunroff that I have been using all
&gt; weekend back to Phoenix and I think Rich is letting me drive this so I
&gt; will buy the 23 window that I have found in Omaha.  I think I am going to
&gt; have to as it has been to fun to drive with the sunroof open and would
&gt; love to put a bed in the back of it and be able to lay there and see the
&gt; stars out the sunroof.  Had a blast and I thni all the Buskatiers did.  At
&gt; the end of the show 2 police cars pulled up and they had some girl in
&gt; there that had made some tea out of some plant here and she was wiggin'.
&gt; See ya when i get back down to Phoenix tonight.  Post more there
&gt; Leaving Ronnies
