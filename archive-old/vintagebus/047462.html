The engine that I just drove to KP and back on  in my 61 was the motor that 
came with my 65 westy 4 1/2 or so years ago.  It used to be a DP when I got 
it.  I put rebuildt heads (SP) on it  a couple years ago.  checked the ps and 
cs, they were within spec, and I think I replaced the rod bearings on it.   
end play was still good.  Old 70s AE case I believe.

If you got it last fall, and have driven it around, cool, no worries.   The 
motor that I temporarily had my my 61 was a mystery DP, then I came to my 
senses.  Good God!   drive 40miles and the oil looks like molasses, dont 
drive that 2K miles next week!  So I swapped the camper's motor into the 61.  
I'll swap them back and the mystery motor'll get the round town driving with 
frequent oil checkings deal for a few hundred miles.

Ya, I noticed a lot of new 1776s too.

 &gt;     Does every one who goes anywhere have a new engine.  I noticed that
 &gt; Ronnie in Prescott had a new engine in the wife's   car.  JP in Co has one 
in
 &gt; his Westy (where did your Havasu trannie go?)  Hell I am getting ready to
 &gt; drive 1800 miles in the engine that came with the truck that I bought last
 &gt; Fall.  Am I supposed to be worried or something? 
 &gt; You guys that stay home need not reply.  Thanks
