Subject: Re: [VB] Another clutch question

&gt; Use the 70 and earlier type clutch on the engine, and since you cleared the
 bell housing, it should pop in (if the starter is 12V).
If you use the later clutch with the myriad of arms, it'll make a horrible
 noise with the earlier TO bearing (did that once, and had to pull the motor
 right back out)
 .............

Not sure what you mean here.  The diaphragm pressure plate [myriad of arms] is made with the collar on it for
64-70 buses. I have one in both my 66 and 67 buses. Works very well. Both are 200mm. The 66 is a 6V flywheel,
the 67  is a 12V flywheel.
