Original German....if only it were more available and at a price we all
could afford!
Unfortunately, I have yet to find one that makes the bends at the lower
outside corner of the glass and fills the void....hence, no gaposis.
Best to heat up some roofing tar...apply an even coat around the perimeter
of the sheet metal just forward of the window lip just prior to
installation of the glass/seal.
cleans up wll with mineral spirits and not harmful to your paint.  Works
really well.  Might be a bit of a bugger years and years later when
cleaning it up for another seal/glass replacement..when isn't there lots
of work on these tho huh?
later
