&lt;&lt;  Snap-on has a super neat wrench just for changing gear oil and engine oil.
 1 end has the 17mm hex and the other end had a 22mm box. It has a slight
 offset and you can remove reduction box plugs with tires on. It sells for
 aroung $50.00 but I think it is worth it. Check with your local Snap-on
 dealer.

make that 21mm on the other end, drain your fluids with one wrench that feels 
good in your hand.  But I like the 17mm bit that goes on the ratchet, easier 
to ratchet than  use a wrench, aren't I lazy?  Break it loose with the snap 
on tool though.  Still remove tires, don't want geasr oil on them.   Poor 
snap on guy, was all confused when I wanted to buy tools.
