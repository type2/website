Hi All,

How is the rear seat pedestal of an early (i.e. 59) double cab held in
place????  I know about the two carriage bolts and wing nuts that hold the
pedestal to the back cab wall but there appears to be two locations that
could be used to hold it down to the floor.  My DC only had the two rear
wall carriage bolts.

If there are fasteners that are supposed to be there, anyone have a set of
*correct* ones?


TIA and see you at OCTO!


David
