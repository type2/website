Subject: Re: [VB] resistance question

Hi Alex,
Also a good idea to check the voltage going into the coil from the ignition 
switch, through the headlight switch, through the fuse box and through the 
starter connections,  from the battery and even the battery cables themselfs! 
 If you find that the fuse box and head light switch is causing resistance 
you need to solder all the pressed and riveted parts in these together.  
Check out the type2_dot_com library for the headlight switch soldering article 
there we helped to write.  Eric&amp;Barb
