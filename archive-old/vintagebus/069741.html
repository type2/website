Subject: Re: [VB] Internal Radio Antenna?

I just bought a powered window mount one for 15.00.   I plugged it in and 
shoved it in the parcel tray.  Unpowered I was able to get about half of the 
local stations(I got more by pulling it and holding it up to the window).  
I'll power it up later this week and see how it does.  At least I'm getting 
npr.  I picked up some cheapo marine speakers too for the doors.  They sound 
pretty good for 20.00 speakers and they are supposedly water proof.  Now I 
can listen to the radio underwater.
