 I believe that Todd is right about the USA spec for busses and bugs, butI
think '60 was the last year that semaphores were available in Europe. 
I'm fairly certain that's true for Bugs, figure Buses would probably follow
suit(??).
 So...now I'm curious. Does anybody out there have a '61 Bus with semaphores?
Thanks, Dave

parts list indicates semaphores were used through ch 614 455, end of may 1960,
on certain buses
