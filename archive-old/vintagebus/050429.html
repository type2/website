&gt; I just bought a house (closed on it yesterday). It has a 2 car

&gt; few projects in the back w/o the neighbors complaining. With
&gt; somewhere to store a project, and a garage to work in, I'll finally
&gt; be able to &quot;go vintage&quot;. I'll also be able to get some things done on
&gt; the 79 that I didn't want to tackle in the condo parking lot.
