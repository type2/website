Well, you know, that's a good question.  The answer is a bit more
convoluted than might be preferred, though.  The heads are right for a
40hp (going by what the guy at BFY had to say - the intake studs point
straight up).  What I don't know is if the P&amp;Cs are right.  The
previous owner, who installed it after blowing up the bastard 40hp, at
one point said it was a (non-bastard) 40hp, and at another said it was
a 1300.  These are not consistent statements.

What I do know is that the center-to-center spacing of the upper
exhaust studs on #s 2&amp;4 are 21.25 inches apart (hence my other
postings about muffler measurements).  My belief is that this is a
40hp engine, built on a 1300 case.  The case is a factory rebuild (has
an X stamped into it), so there's not a lot we can tell from it.
