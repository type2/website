Subject: RE: [VB] Heater tubes?

There should actually be two pieces in between the heater box and the tube
welded to the body... the little canisters that look like mufflers, and a
section of flexible tubing.  Both pieces are about 10 inches long.  The
flexible sections should have fabric insulation around them.  Both items
come up on thesamba and ebay.

On my '66 Deluxe the previous owner had jerry-rigged the heater tubes(?)from
the heat exchangers to the body tubes(?) that bring the heat fwd.  Any good
source for the 'correct' tubes?  My guess is 2&quot; ID  on one end and 2-1/2&quot; ID
on the other end.
