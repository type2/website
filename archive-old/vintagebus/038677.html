&gt; wow! that just gave me a great idea. in theory, you could take a heated rear
&gt; window out of a baywindow to replace the 63-67 rear window, couldn't you? i
&gt; could even use my havard switch that doesn't work. and it wouldn't even be a
&gt; hack job!
&gt; 
&gt; just a random thought that i thought i'd share.

Not sure if it will fit but I can almost guarantee you that you will never
find a a rear window from a bay that actually still defrosts. I suspose you
could &quot;fix&quot; the breaks in the conductive lines. Also there is a relay
associated with that setup.
