Subject: [VW Minivan] That's why I just bought a '93 Eurovan

I was trying to think positively. ;-)

I waited and waited and waited, and like Rennie says, I too was  
disappointed in VWs plans. So I bought a '93 Eurovan instead. My wife  
hates minivans and there was no way she was willing to get into one.

I've scaled back my projects so I hopefully can now re-focus on the  
'65 bus and get 'er done.
