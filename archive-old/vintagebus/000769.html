I have a 6V crankstart 36h.p. motor i pulled from a 58 single cab.
The original owner said it had been replaced at the dealer in 1974.
She drove it 10,000 miles (so she said) when the brakes went out and she 
parked it.
The case is blank with no stamps, no numbers nothing. Any ideas from the list?
Regards, Greg

&lt;&lt;Yeah I have a 36 hp that was redone at the factory...except mine has a VW

symbol with little arrows going around it in a circle (recycle symbol). Then

it has the letter A, then the numbers, then ends with X.

Is the recycle VW symbol a common thing? I've never heard anyone mention

that before
