&gt; So that has stopped.... but at night with lights on, I still get very faint 
&gt; red glow when brakes are applied or turn signal is used. But a big red is 
&gt; when the wiper motor is pulled on. I have a Bosch alternator with just 20,000 
&gt; miles on it, belt tight, and possible extra demand from Hella H-7's.

Hi Scott,
Go through the connections to the wiper and its ground wire, plus take your 
wiper motor out for a complete clean out and repacking with lithium grease in 
all moving parts. Have you soldered all the clips in your fuse box together?  
Do not overtighten the gen/alt belt or risk premature gen/alt bearing failure.  
Additionally go through the procedures in the 1963-67 VW Transporter Shop 
Manual, section E-2, page 14.
