Subject: Swap meet scores

Hey Volks

This past Sunday was the bi-annual Piston Ring Club swap
meet. The Piston Ring is one of the bigger national old car
clubs, for all makes.

The last few of these I'd attended were very disappointing,
but this time I made a few good scores.

I got a 12V splittie fuel gauge (Brazilian) and a VDO oil
pressure gauge and a VDO ammeter, as well as a Speedwell oil
pressure gauge.

I also picked up two very good Hella taillight lenses for my
63 Beetle, as well as a whole pile of new bumper grommets.

But the real scores were literature: I found a factory
Beetle workshop manual (1958, Vol2, to go with the 1960 Vol1
I already had). Also found a 1965 Bosch electrical parts
catalogue. And the real cherry was a workshop manual for
Solex carbs, published by the South African Solex importer.

And best of all, the whole lot cost less than the equivalent
of US$25.
