Or more correctly &quot;Aw Bolts&quot;

Short story:
Does anyone know what size bolts I need to install the trans into my '60 SC?

Long story:
I have a '60 SC I bought pretty much as you see at www.wyricks_dot_com/vw .  It
was too easy to stay in Southern California and finish the restoration.  So
to make it more interesting, I took a job offer in Seattle and will be
moving at the end of October.  In fact, I am already working in Seattle as I
write this and am flying back and forth on the weekends to get things ready
for the move.

I have a flat bed trailer ready, but it'd be a lot easier if I had tires
under the SC.  The front end is ready to go, so I sent the trans off and had
it completely rebuilt all the way out to the brake backing plates and a
friend is picking that up from the shop this week.

So far, so good.

The job I now face (besides ordering mounts from somewhere and getting them
delivered before Friday since I didn't think about that until just today) is
to mount the trans so I can bolt the wheels on to it.  The fun part is that
I'll have just one day to do it.  No problem...if I have the bolts on hand.
That is a big IF since I didn't take it apart and haven't seen any bolts in
the boxes of stuff I got w/the truck.

So, if anyone happens to know what I'll need I'll sleep a lot better this
week in anticipation of the job ahead of me.

Thanks in advance,

-Tom
