for me.  I couldn't tell them apart!  The only one that stood out
at all was the slammed '53 from Florida.  This was the car that came out
of the bay area, and was a previous cal-look hall-of-shamer.

I've been thinking that if I ever got my '54 down to a SoCal show,
nobody would really notice that it was any different than the others.
Other than being accessorized out the wazoo, the right-hand-drive aspect 
would set it apart, but a lot of people wouldn't notice that right off (pun
intended).  I've been thinking of painting it 311/312, and I saw a BD 
standard down there that color, which got me thinking more about it.
