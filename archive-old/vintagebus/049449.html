Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Ready, Set...REBUILD! Part 2

&gt;NQ,
&gt;
&gt;It's been a while since I've rebuilt an engine, but I thought those sealing
&gt;nuts go on with the red seal facing out.  I understand it keeps the oil
&gt;from creeping around the threads, but doesn't seal between the nut and case.
&gt;
&gt;Can any gurus shed some light?
This is the same advice I have been given by my two gurus...  i have NEVER
seen a RECENT rebuild w/ the nuts having the red side towards the case.
