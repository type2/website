&gt; What are your opinions on balancing a bread-and-butter 1600?  I wanted

WHAT!!!!!  

Of COURSE you should balance a stock 1600. ANY engine.

It it a mass of rotating and recipocating parts.  In order to get anywhere
near max potential, they must be balanced.

You wouldnt run the 911 down the road on unbalanced tires, would you? You
hate the feeling it causes in the steering wheel.  Now imagine how your
case feels containing those forces.


&gt; there is a description of a process called &quot;boattailing&quot; the case, basically
&gt; &quot;porting&quot; the area of the case under the pistons, to improve airflow

Huh?  Maybe a picture would help.

&gt; this on VW's?  How about piston squirters?

I've heard of people doing that.  Dunno how muhc help it would be on a
stock engine.;)
