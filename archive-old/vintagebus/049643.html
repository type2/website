Subject: carb deepcleaning question

I have a 28 PICT that I am rebuilding...but the passge from the accel pump
to the throat is clogged, and I can see no way to get at it (short of
pulling out the fitting at the end, reaming, and refilling the opening,
that is :P). Any liquids or procedures anybody can recommend? The deposits
are likely those nasty white corrosion deposits pot metal makes......
