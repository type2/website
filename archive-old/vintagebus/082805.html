Subject: Re: [VB] Door handles.

Hi Chris,
T'would be good to state the handle part numbers you are talking  about.  
From what little info you have mentioned it sounds like your old  handles are the 
rare very early 1964 model type.  These handles are a &quot;T&quot;  series key profile 
lock used in 1964-67 buses.  The earlier flip style  front door handles are &quot; 
E, Z, D, V, &amp; F.  You can check the bus parts  manual through vintagebus_dot_com 
for more info.
