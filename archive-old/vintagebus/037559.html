  I've never heard of one.  Of course, you can remove it and plug the

Hi Dworkin,
We have in the past just cut off the 34PICT-4 shutoff valve foot with a pair 
of dikes.  If the engine is properly tuned, complete, with CR of 7.1:1 or 
less on our USA fuel, and not run too hard (Hot).  They run and shut off just 
fine without and run on.   Eric&amp;Barb
