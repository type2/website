Subject: Re: [VB]   High roog owner alert

I've been running the stock safari seals on my original safar frames with
the same leakage problems. Not really too big a deal, but in order to give
them a break I just recieved some &quot;new&quot; technology safari seals from Japan.
They have the same hollow &quot;crush&quot; tube as the original but on top of this
tube is a small flat seal surface to go flush against the safari frames.
Will see how they work out.....

&gt; well, the WCM Safari seals were letting lots of water in, in the bottom
&gt; corners, so he's having to put towels etc on the dash to soak it up a bit,
&gt; to prevent his electrics being drenched, not good!.
