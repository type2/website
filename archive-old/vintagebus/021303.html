I had one on my 65 Sundial....worked great.  It was just basically how you 
describe it...slid right in the dipstick tube. As it heated up the connection 
at the top would get closer together, if you got too hot it would touch 
slightly until it was fully closed.  It was hooked up to the idiot light on 
the dash....actually i had a two prong male connector on my oil pressure 
switch and it hooked right on there.  I know when going over Hoover Dam in 
the dead of Vegas summer, it would start to flicker and if i didn't let up it 
would stay on until it cooled down.  I believe it would start to flicker 
around 210-215 and stay on around 220.  Don't quote me on that.  I think she 
ran around 10 bucks and was a great buy IMHO.  Especially if you dont want to 
mount aftermarket gauges/wires etc.

&gt; I went on one bus camp out and one of the dooooooods had used an
&gt;  electric thermometer in place of the dipstick and it was wired to a temp
&gt;  guage. That is, if I remember correctly. Wish I had paid more attention.
&gt;  Can anyone shed some light here??
