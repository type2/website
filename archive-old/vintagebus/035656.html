Hi JP,
Not probable!  If it was your wheel cylinders wouls atomaticly pop apart 
blowing brake fluid all over.
What really happens is that the shoes reach such a high temp that they glaze 
over with a glassy finish.  Which only goes away with carefull use a slow 
speeds to wear off this layer of glaze later.
Definitlely one has to realise that it is best to not start down a steep hill 
at mach speed and use the brakes in short burst to slow instead of dragging 
them for long periods and overheating them!    Eric&amp;Barb
