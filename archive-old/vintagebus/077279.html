Subject: HOTWIRE!!

hey folks,
    i was testing out my headlights, when i smell something burning. so, i look in the cab, and what i saw scared the bajesus outta me! smoke! smoke everywhere! so i hurry up and turn the headlights off and run to the back of my bus and unhook the battery, then i run bach up to the cab and see if there has been a fire. WHEW!! no fire! just the grey wire for the high beams has melted into oblivion., so, what do i do? i replaced the wire till i saw no more melt or burn marks. then i try again, same thing, but this time, the wire that connects to the switch for the high beams has melted and is toast. now the first meltdown, was only on the drivers side, i had replaced the passenger side wire when i first got the bus back in august. im glad the passenger side wasnt effected during this ordeal, the only thing that effected it was the second meltdown. so my question to you all is, what would cause this to happen? what is the cheapest way for me to fix it? thanks in advance,
josh
