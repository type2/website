NQ:

Sorry to hear about Bob. That was tragic.

Your mention of electrical tape all over your Busses electrical system seems 
typical. Just about every Bus I have seen with electrical problems is the 
result of half-assed wiring work by a previous owner.

It is usually from someone attempting to install their own 8 track player or 
CB radio without reading the instructions.
