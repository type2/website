I have seen this camper Bus and it is the tomato red and white.  It has
the unusual side tilting hatch tho, not the straight pop up type.  It is a
non walk thru and is very unique in the interior and totally original.
Very nice indeed.  The sheet metal work that is always in need of being
done has already been done and it has been done extremely well.  This Bus
is a driver.
I offered him $5K for it last year and he hemmed and hawed about selling
it.  Had I not bought the '66 Westy I have now, I wouldn't hesitate to get
this Bus.  He lives up in Granite Falls WA.
I would be willing to bet he takes it to the Puyallup swap end of the
month, but not positive.
later
