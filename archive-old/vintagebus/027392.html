Subject: re: inconsistant engine probs

Engine is a 1600dp, 009, 34 pict-3

There's your problem right there.  I have had nothing but trouble trying
to run a 34 PICT 3 and a 009 together.  There are a bunch of different
tricks I've heard about to get this to work, rejetting, etc., but I
didn't feel like messing with mine, so I just got a stock
vaccuum/centrifugal combo distributor and now Idon't have these
hesitation problems.

good luck with whatever you decide to do!
