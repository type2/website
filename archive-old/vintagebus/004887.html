&gt;     so.  I have recently received two different catalogs showing a strange
&gt;     looking tool for greasing bearings.  I t fits onto your grease gun and


I bought one of these gizmos once and I hated it.  More grease squeezed out
between the funnel looking part and the bearing than actually went into the
bearing.  My grandfather made his own bearing greaser which was nothing more
than a bolt and 2 washers with a zerk in one of the washers.  He could
really clamp down tight on the bearing and force the grease into the
bearing.

I still do my bearings by hand however - it's just easier for me...
