padding.
Would you reccomend getting it professionally  installed by an
auto-upholstery guy, or Do it myself?


I have seen most seats with hog rings, so I would think that they were
used.  The seats are fairly easy to do since you are using new
upholstery and padding.  I have seen alot of what we call scrim, used
around the edges so that the horse hair wouldn't show through the new
upholstery where is rounds the edges.  You need to use something that is
very thin and will not make it look padded.  Lenny's covers should fit
great and if there material is thick you might not need to use anything
around the edge.  Before you install your upholstery, lay it in the sun
or put it in a dryer for 10 seconds or until nice and stretchable.   So
give it a shot and when finished, sit back and try out that seat.  It
will feel exactly like an original seat.
