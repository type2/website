&lt;&lt; So... since i have a really nice 67 front beam im thinking of throwing 
that in.  the bearings are cheaper, and spare parts are more available, and 
it has none of the problems the 61 beam has. (though the drums are really 
nice, they probably have 3 turnings left! save those for future use.)  Anyone 
think im blaspheming? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Go For it!  We loved our 1960-63 bus suspensions, and how easier it was to 
replace the reduction bearings (One side in two hours at a rest stop!).  The 
later suspension, and outer rear axle bearing is heavier duty (One ton 
instead of only 3/4.), and bigger brakes that make a huge differance.  Unless 
you are going for a museum/trailer bus, having better brakes is just as 
important safety feature as carrying a fire extingusher.   Eric&amp;Barb
