Do It Dude.

Chris

&gt; There are headlight assemblies used on Merc trucks of the
'70s era that
&gt; appear to be an exact match to those on our buses. I
checked with a truck
&gt; part dealer in South Africa and it seems that they are
still available. They
&gt; told me that lenses and seals could be got sepperately. I
think I will buy
&gt; up their entire stock, put them up on ebay and retire to
the Cayman islands
&gt; : -)
&gt;
&gt; later
