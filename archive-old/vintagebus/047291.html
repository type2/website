&lt;&lt; My '66 had one, and I'm pretty sure I saw one on the '60, but haven't 
explicitly looked for one on it.  At least, I've certainly found lots of gas 
puddles over the years, and watched it dripping it out of a tube that comes 
down next to the right rear wheel, directly below where the gas filler 
is....&gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
Okay, that is not an over fill tube as we consider it.  That is connected to 
the metal bib on the bus body that goes around the filler neck.  Thus this 
bib collects the fuel that leaks out the around the gas cap and sends it out 
below the bus instead of all over the right side of the engine compartment.  
Interestingly our 1963 SC does not have this drain tube or even a bib that is 
designed to collect leakage from the cap.  So the fuel just leaks out into 
the compartment the tank sits on.
Overfill tubes are what the post-1960 type 1s have.  Which is a tube directly 
connected into the neck of the gas tank.  So when the fuel level gets to be 
just below the gas cap the fuel instead of leaking out around the gascap and 
into the trunk gets bled directly out under the type 1.  This helps to avoid 
getting just the right fuel/air mixture and blowing off the front hood when 
switching on any of the dash electrical switches and of course rids the 
interior of gas fume smell pre-1961 type 1 often had.
 
&lt;&lt; Agreed.  I usually make a point of doing fill-ups at the start of trips 
(the commute to work qualifies, being a little over twenty miles) for just 
that reason.  &gt;&gt;
Forgot to mention last time if one used the idea that if you got the tank to 
leak when parked on tilt the wrong way as a tank too full, one could only put 
in less than 7or 8 gallons in the tank.  Eric&amp;Barb
