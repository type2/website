Subject: re:[VB] 019 timing and pertronix transplant

I've got an 019 that I've been trying to do this with...

The plate that the points mount to is different, so I transplanted the
plate from an 009. This took some tweaking and cutting. I also cut a
notch in the body of the 019, so it would take a 009 cap (cheap and easy
to find). The rotor from a 009 won't work, however.

The 019 is physically smaller than the 009, so I modified the magnet
plate to try to get it all to fit inside. At this point I set it aside,
and I haven't done anything to it lately.

One of my concerns is whether the relationship between the placement of
the pickup (remember, I changed the plate that the pickup mounts to) and
the position of the cap is where it needs to be to work properly.
Another concern (brought to my attention by Barb and Eric) is that the
019 is designed for a much smaller engine than I'm running now (36 hp.
vs. 1776), so the weights and springs for the advance curve may have to
be modified, too.

An interesting project, not for the faint of heart. Let us know how
yours goes, and maybe I'll pick mine back up again.
