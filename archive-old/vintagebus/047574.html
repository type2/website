&lt;&lt; Code on my 60 Double Cab. I looked the numbers up a while back in one of 
the bus books and came up with the similar info. The first number is 361. 
This is a combination of M169 - Sliding door types 231-238, M181 - Chrome hub 
caps, M192 - body ready to be outfitted as a camper, M199 - Drivers seat as 
swivel seat types 211
 213 214 and camping car. This makes no sense to me. Can anyone shed some 
light on this?
 The complete tag is as follows:
 15 12 9
 361 017 176 207
 UA 265 Grey    the Vin is 547 523 &gt;&gt;

I would interpret that as a 
buildt 15th Dec 1959
