It was the fill plug I was fighting with.
BTW a 17mm allen wrench could be considered a 'lethal weapon' in about 10
states &lt;&lt;g&gt;&gt;.  The damned thing is HUGE !!!!

&gt; Rich brought me down by saying:
&gt; &gt;Anyway I went down to Sears and spent $8.95 for a 17mm
&gt; &gt;allen wrench.  The problem I had was that I  _could_not_  get an angle to
&gt; &gt;get
&gt; &gt;it open; I fought with it for a couple of hours before I finally gave up
in
&gt; &gt;disgust.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Uh-oh, vv
&gt; Where did the Sears allen wrench not fit, Tranny fill plugs or RGBs? Will
&gt; the nightmare ever end? :)
