Subject: Still no parts from Performance Warehouse

Just to keep you all informed that we are working on week #5 since I ordered
parts from the Performance Parts Warehouse.  The guy told me they'd get my
parts to me by Friday of last week (or at least &quot;try to.&quot;  Yeah right.)  It
was a week ago today that I called them and still no parts for my 40IDF
carbs.  What an outfit.  I otta call the VW mags and tell them to yank their
ads if they won't even ship parts when you order them.
