Subject: 60 DD (non-WT) paint
Mime-Version: 1.0


Well, I spent the day detailing little body spots, and then painted the
engine compartment and the dash.  Hint for the future: make 3 or 4 (not 1!)
pass at blowing crap out with the air gun.  I got dust all over the place
when I hit the inside of one of the doors with the paint and it shot crap
all over.  D'oh!  Same goes for the engine compartment - don't
underestimate the &quot;pushing power&quot; of the air out of a paint gun!

I only found one 'thin' spot so far, on the far right corner of the dash.
I'm sure I'll find more later.

Oh, and for the occasion, I bought a new paint gun.  I went to HF to buy a
new regulator-thingy, and ended up buying their top-of-the-line gravity
feed HVLP.  Oh my gawd!  When the sun comes up tomorrow, I'm going to put
my boots on, and kick the old &quot;central pneumatic&quot; gun as far down the
street as I can!  Actually, the CP gun is put together well, but the fluid
tip is too big.  Works well for the filling primer, so that's it's new role
in life.  This new gun shoots so beautifully I couldn't believe it!  The
paint just flows so nice and even and smooth, and it's VERY forgiving!  I
also uses the paint-in-a-ziploc-bag thing, but that only worked well for a
few minutes, then something happened and there was paint everywhere, all
down my arm, on the floor, etc.
