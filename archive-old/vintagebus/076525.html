Subject: Re: [VB]gas heaters, but not J tubes

I'm sure this is a dumb question but why does the mileage go down when the
heater isn't hooked up?

I drove a 66 w/ eberspacher down to California in the winter years ago.  For
some reason the stock heater was not hooked up.  It turned out to have lower
gas milage than I liked.   so I got out (in oregon somewhere) and hooked the
stock heat up, and the bus was warmer even barely using the gas heater, and
the milage got better.   There was snow on the ground I think.

I was told that you shouldn't notice the milage different much at all with
using a heater, and that meant there was something wrong with the one in
that bus, which may well be true.

But that's my story and the next heater may not be perfectly tuned either,
and it just makes sense to keep the stock heater set up.  I don't see any
advantage to getting rid of it.
