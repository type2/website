Hi Steffan,
My son works for America's Tire here in Pasadena.  He has the adapter that you
need.  As America's Tire is a chain of stores, there might be one in your area
that you can check.  They are part of Discount Tire Centers, so maybe you can
check there too.  Let me know if you need my son's phone number at work.  He'd
be glad to help you, or anyone else on the list with your tire/balancing/wheel
needs.

&gt; Could you post the brand/name of the tire machine?  Might help to be able to
&gt; ask specifically when looking around...

&gt; &gt;I just checked with my local family run tire store in the little town where
&gt; &gt;I live in West, Central Ohio.  He has an adaptor that he can use on all
&gt; &gt;wheel types including ours.  It is a modern deal that came with his tire
&gt; &gt;machine.  It will adjust infinitely to any lug nut pattern and will fit on
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt;modern balencing machine.  If we have one in a town of 8000 I bet other
&gt; &gt;tire
&gt; &gt;shops do too...I would keep calling until I found one.  I would bet that
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;big &quot;get-em-in-and-out&quot; shops would not have one but the old family run
&gt; &gt;independant shops might be more inclined to have something like that.
