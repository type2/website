if it is the same filter as a toyota (it looks like it, and most likley
is) or, a toyota filter will fit on it, it will have the bypass valve.

toyota cars, not the trucks, though.  shouldn't have a problem due to
size, the toyota's run small filters, and also have 40-50 psi at idle
and up to 70 max.  should be ok.  remember the old saying &quot;size doesnt
matter&quot;?  or was that something else?  :)

&gt; hopefully better manufacture of filter like Mann, or WIX?
