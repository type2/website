The number behind the seat is useless.  The number you want is the one
below the plate in the engine compartment, it will start with &quot;20-&quot; - your
engine should have a similar number, but probably not the *same* number.

&gt;
&gt;yes it even came with a thirty plus year old title, amazing what people hold
&gt;on to after all these years
&gt;
&gt;will post pics and the story of how this was found and how it ended up where
&gt;it did and how they got it out.
