&gt; Start up a site using a Toyota trademark and see how long it takes for
&gt; Toyota to come after you.

You mean like Toyotanation_dot_com, Toyoland_dot_com, Toyotaclub_dot_org,
Toyotaownersclub_dot_com, Tundrasolutions_dot_com, Toyotacelicasupra-ma61.co_dot_uk,
Toysport_dot_com, Toymods_dot_org, Corollaperformance_dot_com,
Toyota-resources-online_dot_com, 4runnerforum_dot_com, Toyotala_dot_org,
Scionlife_dot_com, Clubsciontc_dot_com, Vtec_dot_net, etc.

Actually, there are a lot of enthusiest sites for other marques.  Do a
search on &quot;chevy enthusiasts&quot; and you'll find dozens of sites with
Chevrolet logos, the names &quot;chevy&quot; and &quot;chevrolet&quot; in the URLs, etc.  This
hasn't stopped GM from successfully defending its trademark against
Malcolm Bricklin's new Chinese import that was going to be called the
&quot;Chery&quot;.

What VW has to realize is that enthusiaest sites that use their name and
logo don't dilute these trademarks in the marketplace.  Rather, they
strengthen the marque through positive portrayal of the manufacturers
products.  Nobody is going to mistake such a site for that of the
manufacturer.  Going after those sites only causes bad feelings between
the manufacurer and their best customers.
