Andres posted to the collective:

   ...And what holds it in either position? Mine currently travels back
and forth with the cable...

  Hey Mon, that is what they make those small stainless o-ring worm screw
clamps that you use on your fuel lines for, you'll need at least 3 of them
and they block the tube that goes through the front tin and fan shroud
from moving back and forth.

  To boogie-on more smartly, find an old speedo cable and cut it and use
the end part that normally pushes into the speedometer and put that end
over the end that the cable runs through the metal tube welded to the
undercarriage.  So with the speedo cable inside right up into the above
mentioned short 8 inch tube you will avoid slowly sawing your tranny - no
really.  The cable is usually naked from the place that the cable runs
through the metal tube welded to the undercarriage to your now clamped
short tube.

  Politeness man tells all daily drivers - do not get water into the metal
tube welded to the undercarriage because when it freezes out the
accelerator cable will freeze inside and render you into a cartoon
character stranded in a suddenly cold cruel conflicting stories of WMD
threatening country.  Furthermore; se vasoline instead of grease in the
accelerator tube, just cause it lasts longer than grease.
