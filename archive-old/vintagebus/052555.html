Subject: Help Installing Deep Oil Sump

Hey all,

I am trying to install a deep oil sump from Bugpack, and was hoping to have 
some help in two areas:

1. How do I get those studs for the oil drain cover plate out (so I can put 
the new, longer ones in?

2. Any advice, tips, warnings, etc. that might also help me in my install 
process?

Thanks much!
