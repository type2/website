Subject: Re: [VB] Newspaper Article:  local VW Bus owners use cooking
  oil for  fuel

&gt; We had a recent newspaper article mentioning a local couple running their
&gt; bay window bus on used cooking oil.  It only mentioned they were filtering
&gt; it a couple of times to remove the gunk.  Not that I want my bus to smell
&gt; like a fries and try this.  I'm just curious if anyones done it or knows how
&gt; you would.

This is not uncommon with diesel engines.&gt;
Did you read carefully maybe it was a vanagon diesel.
Unless converted to biodiesel its not quite as simple as dumping the fry
oil in the tank.
