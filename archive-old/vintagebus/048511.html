Subject: Re: Towing Vehicle?

heya dave - i used a grand cherokee 6 cyl to haul a doublecab from willits
to eugene. would have really stunk if i hadn't used the trailer. glad i did
not use just a dolly.  i rented the trailer in willits - $110 (??) for 3 or
4 days was the uhaul minimum in my case.   - steve

&gt;Anyone towed a Splitwindow Westy with a Jeep Cherokee any distance?  I found
&gt;a good deal on a 66 Westy in Roanoke Va. but renting a UHaul and Trailer
&gt;adds to much to the cost.  There's an outside chance I may be able to use a
&gt;4.0L Cherokee to tow it with and rent a tow dolly. [snip]
