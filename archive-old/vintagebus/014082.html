Does anyone have or know the whereabouts of a deluxe interior?
(Rear bench seat, middle rear pass. seat,door panels and rear pass area 
panels)?
I'm up here in Vancouver BC and there doesnt seem to be all that many used 
parts that are in decent shape and that people are willing to let go of!
Every one take it easy and keep veedubbin!
