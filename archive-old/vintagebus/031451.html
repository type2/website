&gt; I have collected 22 which are on my bus right now; tastefully arranged. I
&gt; can still see out the back window with the right rear window covered with
&gt; most of them.

As a kid, my family did a lot of trailer traveling all over the south western
US.  I could never talk my dad into putting those stickers on the windows for
each place we had been to.  Seemed really cool to see a camper or trailer with
those all over the windows.  &quot;man, those people have been everywhere!&quot;.
