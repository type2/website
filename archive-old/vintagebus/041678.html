Gosh.  You make it sound like he is running a business.  Sure, its for
profit, but he is not doing this full time. And so what if he has been
doing it often lately?  Does that mean he has to check his email every few
hours, and run out and check on a minor item everytime someone requests
it?  

&gt; you not expect better service from those you do business with?  I find it
&gt; annoying if I don't get a simple answer like this within 24 hours.

Interesting, as I've always considered it kosher to allow up to a week for
an initial reponse like this.  Had this been a transaction with a company
int he business of selling parts via email (not just a compnay who .has.
an email address, mind you) i still would allow 2-3 days for a reply.

Had I needed to know immediately, i would have picked up a phone and
_dot_called. the person or company in question, and by such letting them know
that you are very interested in said part, and definitly intend on
purchasing it if they have a good one.

An emailed query on a part can (and, often is) be nothing more then a
simple &quot;just wondering...&quot; type of query.  I've sold a fair amount of
parts through a half dozen mailing lists on the internet and recieved (and
admitedly placed) 2 or three times as many of this type of query then i
have the sort where someone (or I..) actually purchased the part.

I'm rambling though.

whichever.
