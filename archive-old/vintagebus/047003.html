I have two new correct treasure chest locks for my 63 singlecab, that Ckara &amp; Roger Nang found for me on our trip t Hessisch Oldendorf.
Therefore I have two locks installed that I bought in Bad Camberg in 99. They are NOS and have a different and later key shape than the 63. So now I luckily have two correct key locks.

I will be changing the locks and will have two unused NOS locks for a 64-65 singlecab.
I really want to trade them for something. Let me know what you have and I will be taking them off real soon.
What I really want is a NOS ignition key or steering column lock that would use a 63 key!

BTW Clara will certainly kow exactly what year my later locks are for. They must be pre 67 as that only has one hole in the treasure chest door.
