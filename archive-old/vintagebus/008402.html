Bryan:

One thing often overlooked is the condition of the rubber brake hoses. As
they get old, they can swell up internally and restrict the flow of the
fluid to and from the wheel cylinders.  This can make your brakes seem week.

Thank You.

&gt; What is a good way to upgrade the brakes on a 62
&gt; single cab? &gt; -  -- -  -
&gt; how is the condition of your system now.   ?  One thing I have found is
that
&gt; if you inspect all your wheels, use rough sandpaper on any glazed drums of
&gt; shoes.  (yes really, it makes a difference), and  replace you old brake
hoses
&gt; it will improve you stopping power,  There is a lot of differenc between
tip
&gt; top and well it works.
