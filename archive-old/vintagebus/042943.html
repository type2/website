Finally I'm back to workin' and messin' with type 2's again instead of
those creapy type 1's.  Don't get me wrong, I love buzzin' around in my
'56 bug with a little 1641cc.  It even gets rubber in first gear.
But anyway, I started body work on the 1961 15-window that I picked up
last year some time.  It was still sitting in Pullman, WA where I bought
it and I finally decided to trailer it home.  Since 75% of the body was
surface rust from the PO grinding all the OG paint off some ten or so
years ago, the first logical step (at least in my mind) was to strip the
bus and have it sandblasted by a recommended pro.  Well I found one, and
for a couple hundred bucks he did it and it turned out awesome to say the
least!  It's like starting with a blank canvas.  All the rust is gone and
the whole body is bare metal.  Don't worry, it's in a cool dry shop right
now.  The plan was to seal it right away and then do body work as time and
money would let me, but I may be doing the majority of the body work this
summer before shooting the sealer/primer.  Anyway, I'll have pics someday
of the new project and the trashed '57.

BTW, the '61 deluxe still needs belt-line trim, vent trim (yeah, right),
rear bumper trim, and a Sigla rear window.  Ya know, all the easy
stuff.....right?
