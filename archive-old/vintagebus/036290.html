In a message dated 98-08-13 10:26:46 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Anyway, would it be possible to take an old pair of
 reduction boxes and cut the axle tubes off so that all you have is the box
 itself. Then take the lower inner and outer bearings and the stub axle, put
 all of this together and bolt it to the spring plate. Then I would ned to
 put the drum back on with out the brake parts and the wheels and tires.
 Would this setup be strong enough to hold the whole bus up? Does the axle
 tube provide any stability to the rear end, or is it all supported by the
 lower bearings? Anybody got some insight? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
The axle tube give the swing plates support sideways to prevent the swing
plates from getting bent.   Go with the bracket with the single (Or two if
really want.) swivel wheel that will give you more manuvering and ease to move
the non-powered VW around.    Eric &amp; Barb
