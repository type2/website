the price of original SWF blades has gone through the roof and as of late
I've only been able to get them in black. I also have some good repo's that
are 10 dollars a blade and they are silver.

Alright, I've read the archives on wiper blades, and I'm still a bit lost...
I have no blades on my bus, so I don't know the correct size that I need.
RMMW sells replacements, but it says that the early bug and bus blades are
the same.  I noticed that someone on the list said that the bus blades are
actually longer...  So what do I need, and where can I get them at a
reasonable price in fairly short order?

Also, the wiper arms I have are 2 different lengths.  Is this normal?

Thanks,
