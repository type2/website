any idea how bad it is when the spline comes off the tranny?  I mean, in this 
bus the clutch was actiing up, and the motor came out to investigate.

the spline from the tranny came out partly with the motor, and there is loads 
of oil- gear oil, in the bell housing, and the clutch disc looks pretty 
thrashed from oil etc

I mean like the spline is not firmly fixed in place,  you can pull it out 
about 5 or so inches, and I am sure that it will continue to leak.

but I seem to remember someone drove around with a spline like this without 
any problems

Comments?

The tranny shifts fine and does not pop out of any gear, or make horrible 
noises
