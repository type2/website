Subject: Barndoor side panels needed for repair
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2000 10:02:32 -0700
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

A guy named Earl here in town got sideswiped in his '52 Panel (again!) and
could use the following:
1. Passenger door
2. Passenger rear corner or, preferably, Passenger rear side from corner to
cargo door pillar.  I believe the lower 1/2 is all that is needed.

He would prefer Barndoor panels but will take others.

Prefer location close to Phoenix, AZ, to minimize shipping.

Let me know,
Everett Barnes
