Hi all,
   OK, I can hear Clara, et al now about lowered busses but I bought it and
now I'm stuck with it (won't do it again) and I'm pleading for assistance.
The vehicle in question is a 62 crewcab and I can't seem to find  front
shocks that are short enough (none on there now) tho I may have some leads
via the net. I don't have the bus with me and they're asking me questions I
don't have answers to. I DO know the static length is 10&quot; from the center
of the lower pin to the center of the upper bolt mount. What they're asking
me is the diameter/length of both the pin and the bolt. ANYBODY? Also, has
anyone else cross referrenced shocks from another vehicle for a similar
situation? I'd assume I'll need them to compress to at least 8&quot; and expand
to 12  or so. I've checked with my local FLAPS and if they're not &quot;off the
shelf&quot; applications, they can't be bothered.
