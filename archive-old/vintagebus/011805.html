	Ok now I know I am stumped.....I was reading the IDIOT
guide...and adjusting the timing sounded so easy...Just look up the year
of your motor and presto use your little lite and yer home free....

	But Eric and Barb pointed out that will only be correct if the
motor and distributor are original to the car....which I don't think mine
are....I need some help.

	I looked under the generator  pedestal under my motor and saw
this #

	AE722005

	1386

	I looked on the side of the distributor which I believe is the
vacuum advance type...One hose coming from carberator to it...and saw
these #s

Hook me up old wise VW gurus...Appreciate it...and thanks again.
