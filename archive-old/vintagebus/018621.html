A couple bags of sand in the back of the bed?

cut traction grooves in the driveway? (I've seen this done)

&gt; I do have a problem with my DC.  There's a '67 tranny and RGB's on there,

&gt; tight, steep curves which can be sorta slimy this time of year.  The angle
&gt; of the curves, combined with the steepness make one of two bad things
&gt; happen:  1.  The whole vehicle jerks and jumps alarmingly  2.  The tyres
&gt; spin LOTS more than they should.  It's almost as if the front brakes are on!
&gt; (I'll be checking that ASAP!)
