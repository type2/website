Hi Dworkin,
Well we are able to do it by reaching over the upper left side of the engine, 
undo the fuel line and plug it with pencil, philips screw driver or better 
yet a golf tee one hand!  Any fuel leakage misses us because we are in the 
engine compartment removing/sealing off the flex fuel line after backing out 
the engine and lowering it a few inches.  Which is doable with the 5-6&quot; extra 
length of flex fuel line in front of the engine.

&lt;&lt;Well, how much force should it take to move the switch itself by hand,no 
cable involved?  It takes a fair amount of force on mine, and I can see the 
cable bend a *lot* if someone else pushes on the knob.&gt;&gt;
Quite a bit though not a huge amount.  To keep fuel from leaking out of the 
reserve switch it has a very strong spring to push all of the parts and the 
seal together while allowing it to swivel from position to position.  Also it 
most likely needs some moving back and forth to loosen the valve a bit after 
not being used for quite sometime.   Eric&amp;Barb
