Subject: NOS versus Repop

With all this talk about NOS mirrors, Ebay ethics, and the authenticity
of parts, I have to wonder if NOS really matters so much. 

I try to buy NOS parts when I can find them (in the pretty blue
boxes) but when the repop is so dead-on and matches almost perfectly
to the orginal, what is the point of having NOS.  The repop round
mirrors by all accounts only have a very subtle difference from
the original in the way the part number is stamped. So why not
just buy the less expensive repop? When we are questioned about
the authenticity of a particular part on our buses, should we
pull the original box out as the pedigree?  NOS is cool when
there is a major difference in appearance and functionality,
but save the money and buy high qualtiy repops.

What I'm getting at here...send me all of your NOS parts in the
boxes and I'll replace them with repops :)
