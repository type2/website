&lt;&lt; In the library at www.type2_dot_com there is an excellent article on sound
 deadening entitled &quot;Heat, Rust and Noise in VW's.&quot; You should look that up
 and read it.

ya- except he tells you to use spray foam- which is obviously a sign of being 
possessed by a demon- as spray foam encourages rust.

I get road noise- adding a front floor mat and pedal splash pan helps.  a 
seconf floor mat may help more.   Good heat tubes and heat on adds engine 
noise.    So you may want to leave your heat off
