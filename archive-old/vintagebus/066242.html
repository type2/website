Subject: troubleshoot solution, lessons learned

Hello Everyone,

First of all, thanks to all that replied to my subaru electrical question 
yesterday.  The cascade of events begins with a dead battery.  Next comes a 
friendly acquaintance that helped me to attempt a jump start.  Prior to the 
jump, with the key in accessory position I had power to the radio, windows, 
vent fans, etc.  Following the attempted jump start, I had no power to 
anything.  I just assumed that the battery had at that point given up and 
totally died.

Dove into it this morning, got a new battery, and had the alternator checked 
at the FLAPS.  Checked out okay, but still no start.  Checked fuses, and my 
fusible link was cooked.  I made a new one with some leftover wire and a 
couple crimp connectors, turned the key to accessory position and just 
touched the wires to the terminals, ready to pull away if it started to 
smoke.  No problem.  Hooked the wire up permanently, and the car started up. 
  Happy ending.

What I believe happened is that the acquaintance that attempted to jump 
start my car did not know as much as I gave him credit for.  I think he had 
+ and - mixed up, regardless there was a mixup.  This cooked my fusible 
link, and thus prevented my car from getting cooked.

So, lessons learned.  Number one, always visually double check what the 
other guy has done before you hook up your end of the jumper cables to make 
sure that red and black mean the same to both of you.  Verbal is not 
acceptable.  Second, start simple, and check the fuses and fusible links 
first before you start pulling the alternator.

Next, what kind of protection against reversed polarities do our busses 
have?  If this scenario would have played out with the bus, would I be 
looking at a new wiring harness, or possibly worse?

Always learning...
