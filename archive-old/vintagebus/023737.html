Subject: Re:Bus Tow Bar Use Report

&gt;     The tow bar is fairly narrow, so any looseness between
&gt;     the U hanger and the torsion tube results in the bus
&gt;     weaving around when braking.
&gt;
The tow bar needs to be narrow to fit early and late splitties. I made
and have used this style tow bar (made out of 2&quot; cold rolled steel) at
my shop on a daily basis for many years. I have found that this
wandering side-to-side is the result of tires not being filled to the
proper pressure. Fill up your tires and try it again and the odds are
that the problem will have disappeared.

&gt;     A wider U spacing would be better, but the tow bar is sized to
&gt;     fit loafs also, so probably some compromises were made.
&gt;
As far as I know from experience of hooking these tow bars up to early
and late buses, there is no difference between the beams as far as fit
is concerned.Gary
