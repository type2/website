Subject: Re: Bus cover-PVC enclosure?
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 1998 23:56:35 PST


 I am planning on spending
&gt;around $250 to get one of those cheapo PVC tubing and tarp car 
enclusures for
&gt;my bus.  I would rather have the cover not in contact with the bus.  I 
would
&gt;build my own, but I just cant find any PVC angles that would help me to 
peak
&gt;

Hi everyone. Ok its friday, lets see if I can get away with talking 
about something just nearly bus related. I am currently working on 
selling plans for making sheds, storage, greenhouses whatever. The parts 
are not expensive and easy to put togther. I just built a 14X6 frame 
that took about 2 hours to put together out of common parts. Not  PVC. 
Cost about $30. If you are interested, send me email and I will send 
plans for how to do it for $3. Any size is possible, your cost to build 
it may vary depending on what you want. Mine is currently covered with 
tarps, but will soon have shingle siding and glass windows. The 
structure is zinc coated steel. I hope I don't get flak for trying to 
sell an idea, but I am about to put this into major publications for 
handy people and don't want my idea stolen. 
Tools needed: Saw, level, screwdriver, and one rented part. Thats all.

Thanks for listening, again, its friday. By the way, just removed the 
engine from my 70 westy sundowner. Its going to quit leaking oil, 
darnit! Meanwhile, the 63 will get out of the weather and can begin its 
journey to get the leaky windows and poptop fixed. All interior is 
comming out and hopefully it will be fixed up really nice. New glass, 
new seals.
