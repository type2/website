well...i have gotten back on the net, and have been able to access the
digests...thank god, I am having serious Bus withdrawal.

I am 'stuck' on the side of a mountain in the middle of nowhere, most of the
cars around here, you could fit two of them in a bus.

One interesting note:when I got off the train and was waiting for a ride to
the school I am staying at I notcied a bus. It was in pretty great shape, all
red(deep red). Unfortunately it was a bay window. I am keeping my eye out for
splits here.

There are actually a lot of single cabs and double cabs, but they are not
splitties. I can't tell how new these are, but they look pretty cool, I don't
understand why we aren't able to get them in the us.

Anyway I have only two ways of transportation around here-my left and right
foot. I miss my bus, I am planning on making a trip at some point to
germany...and will be trying to check out the vw stuff there.

Any suggestions on VW places to visit in Germany-good places to find
parts...or parts that might be a lot cheaper to get over here, as opposed to
paying an import tax and buying in the US.

Well I'm glad I can still read what you all are up to-debating the finer
points of fire extinguishers etc.

'65 bus stored in a friends garage outside boston...I am sure it misses me as
much I miss it
