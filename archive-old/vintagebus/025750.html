Well,

I leave tomorrow at noon to fly up to Pasco WA (Eastern) and retrieve my new(to me) 67 W/T H/T Westy courtesy some frequent flyer miles.  A friend of mine will help me tow it back from ID where it's sat for the last 15 years or so.  We'll bring it back to his house in Umitilla where will throw a motor in it and fix what needs fixing.  Then I'll drive it on back home.  Should be a nice little adventure since I driven all of 10 miles in any split bus and I live in Southern CA.

I'm taking all the spares I can as well as a print out of the AIRS directory of helpful nice people.  

Does anyone know of a VW place in Pendelton OR.  I heard there was a good one there.  Just incase we need any odd ball parts that I'm not bringing with me.

I'm heading out Sunday or Monday from Umitilla/Hermeston West along the Columbia (Craig, what side of the river are you on?) ...South at Portland along the 5. I think I'll need a place to stop somewhere in Central to Southern OR, &amp; possibly Central CA.  Anyone have a driveway I can park in for the night?

Steve Harris
