&gt;  Hi      I've got 2 1776 engines one stretches and rotates belts, I've gone
&gt;  through 3 in 2500 miles, the other does not,same belts, adjusted the same. 
I
&gt;  don't go over 5500 rpm in either engine, and usually way below that, 4th
&gt;  gear cruising isn't the highest rpm for me  it's shifting up through the
&gt;  gears... The engine that stretches belts revs up so much quicker, I think 
it
&gt;  must be the speed it changes RPM (lightened fly wheel and in the Beetle).  
I
&gt;  was browsing through Air cooled nets web site and He has a belt to use to
&gt;  combat this. I'm going to get one of those and see what happens... Lloyd in

well, just keep a bunch of belts with you, as since the option of driving 
more conservatively probably won't appeal.     to be more specific, speedily 
revving to 5,500 is yes likely to affect the belt.   quickly revving up and 
down would affect it more than smoothly revving to a top speed and cruising 
in 4th.

other question- are you pulleys lined up properly?  The crank pulley in the 
same line as the gen pulley?  if they are not, then belts will be affected.  
The reason for this offset could be a 38A gen, using diff gen front cover 
plates, or diff gen pulley.
