&gt; What is up with VW?  They're gonna be selling a

2L!  

The station wagon is the next SUV. Check out the
cycle: 1970's = station wagons, they got &quot;outcooled&quot;
by the custom van conversion in the early 80's, which
was quickly upstaged by the minivan. Pretty soon the
minivan became a dead giveaway that you had 2.3 kids
in the back and were probably headed to some park for
a kid's sporting event. Soon the SUV saved the day,
and made you look like you were going rock climbing
when you were actually headed to the frozen yogurt
shop. Now the things guzzle gas and take a grappling
hook to climb into. So, back to the old. The new.

We have a passat wagon and the thing rocks! Fun to
drive, and has the same size interior as a regular
SUV. Plus, we stay in the VW family. I can think of
nothing else to hunt 67 bus parts with (okay, a single
cab or DC would be cooler, but the wife says one AC VW
is plenty).

Anyone expecting kids? That Passat or Jetta wagon
sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Who wants to see
another Explorer on the road? Not me.

SO...Is that 2002 microbus really a doable concept for
VW or just some artists dream?
