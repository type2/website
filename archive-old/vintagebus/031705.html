Andy in Yuma, Az. has a trailer made out of a double cab bed with 2 rear
gates on it. Also a couple of years ago at the Classic weekend there was a
trailer made out of a splitty just like the bay one. At Vegas a few years
back there was a trailer made out of the back half of a bus. Wait till you
see VW Howards latest trailer when he gets it done! to pull behind his
chopped top single cab.

Yes, this example seems to have a lot of tongue weight, but it
was being towed by an American Land Barge.  It would be a good
idea to shorten the trailer a bit to get es tongue weight.
