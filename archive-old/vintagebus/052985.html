&gt;Hi all,
   I have two early type 2's  both are registered as 1958, one with VIN
#
295464 and the other 369810.  They are supposedly early '58 both have pre=
ssed
bumpers, the later is a camper.  
   
  The 295464 bus has factory sunroof, ambulance partition, no skylights,
and is an 8 passenger bus with standard trim.  Can anyone help determine
the year of this one, possibly the option codes, or does anyone know wher=
e
&gt;I can find this information?
