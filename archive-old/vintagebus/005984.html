Hey Gabe,
    For a low buck driver, nothing beats a set of home-made door panels. I
made some for my '67 that actually turned out pretty decent.  The toughest
part is finding a set of &quot;templates&quot; to use for the new material.  Since
I've had my bus, I've made quite a few - &quot;upgrading&quot; each time. The last set
me &amp; a friend made we used thin plywood type material thats used in showers
and such (to keep down the warpage factor), then some spray glue with some
free tweed material that a buddy had laying around -JUST enough to do all
the panels except for the cargo hatch.  For the seals, I drove my bus
without cargo door seals for a good three years with nothing more than
rattles &amp; occational leaks from wind &amp; rain.  Definately replace the
windshields first, otherwise anything you keep on the parcel shelf will be
soaked.  You can find low back seat covers at W_at_ll M_at_rt that will at least
keep the horse hair off of you, I'm sure you could also find covers for the
rear seat too!
