 Technically, no.  Buses are too fast to be considered a &quot;slow moving
 vehicle&quot; in any state that I know of.  I've never heard of anyone being
 hassled about it, though.
 
 OTOH, you can make a &quot;slow moving vehicle&quot; triangle in any other color and
 be perfectly legal.

Do you know how fast (or slow) you have to drive to be considered a slow 
moving vehicle?    does 50mph qualify?   or does it have to be 45mph or less?  I 
thought it was illegal to drive slower than 45mph on the freeway.
