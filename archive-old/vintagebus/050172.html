Subject: Re: [VB] re:Turnkey/Fuelinjected Mexican Engines

&gt;could someone help me out...what is the advantage of a fuelinjected engine vs.
&gt;using a carb.(do i have that right...if you have a FI you don't have a carb?)
&gt;
&gt;anyway as I live relatively close to Mexico, what are the advantages of this
&gt;engine you are talking about?
&gt;
&gt;thanks

All of the advantages come from the much more precise fuel metering of EFI.
All of the disadvantages come from the added cost and complexity of EFI,
though thigs have improved a million times since the all-transistor 1968
Type 3.

Advantages:

Lower emissions

Lower fuel consumption

Easier starting in all weather

Better drivability, especially when cold

More hoursepower and torque

Individual parts of the fuel delivery system can be diagnosed and repaired
(vs rebuilding the whole carb when something is screwed up inside).




Disadvantages:

More expensive than a carb

Parts costly

Parts delicate (but much better than the old days)

Engine won't start if battery is dead (no push starting on a completely
dead battery)

Many shade tree mechanics shy away from EFI





I'm sure others can add to both lists.
