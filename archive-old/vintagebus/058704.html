Subject: door screws



Hey guys,

   I was putting my passenger side door together today after painting it a 
coupel of months ago when I realized i've misplaced some misc. screws. These 
screws are long gone as I searched for them the rest of the night. My 
questions is, where can i get these screws?
The screws in question are the 4 main screws that hold the window frame on 
the door. They are 4 big machine screws with counter-sunk heads on them. I'm 
also missing the little claws that hold the scraper seal metal cover on. 
these are the claws that bite down in the felt. Maybe a listee out there has 
a door with these parts on them they would sell me?
thanks
john
