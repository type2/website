When shipping anything LTL, it is important to remember to shop around.  To do
this you need to first know the approx. weight and size of the articles being
shipped.  You must include the weight of the skid.  (if you do not have a
skid, most carriers can provide one).  Then, call around to all of the
reputable carriers that service your area.  Ask them if they ship to a
particular point from your city.   The common carriers that are nationwide
include Roadway, Yellow, USF, and ABF.  A lot of carriers will only ship
between a certain geographical area.  These guys can be very cost effective.
Sometimes they will even partner up with another sister carrier to get it to
your point of destination.

While parts that you are shipping may not weigh very much, they may be large,
bulky items.  This cost just as much as the smaller heavy items because of
what the carrier calls &quot;dim weight&quot;.  In other words, you are taking up a lot
of room in his trailer that he could have otherwise put more items in which
makes him more money.  So you have to pay for that space.

If you need pickup at you home or delivery to someone else's home, there might
be additional charges, as well.

I shipped an engine from New York to Tennessee a couple of years ago.  It was
mounted on a skid with an enclosed crate around it.  Total cost was less than
$200 via USF.  I believe that I saved a few bucks by picking it up from the
terminal.

One last note.  If you are shipping fragile articles (especially over long
distances), then package them so that the Samsonite monkey can jump all over
it.  Carriers often transfer freight between trailers using forklifts.  These
dock workers are often in a hurry.  They will damage your freight.  So the
moral of the story is to charge the person buying your parts a little extra
for extra good packaging.  It will save both of you from being in a bad
position when the parts do not arrive in the best of condition.
