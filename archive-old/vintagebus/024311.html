Subject: RE: Fun and Games &amp; Throwout bearing

Okay, so I can't resist a challenge (that's why I drive VWs and work
with computers)!

I have several guesses, in the order I would check them:

1. Firing order: You've connected plug wires for a 1-2-3-4 order instead
of 1-4-3-2. I would expect some backfiring at some RPMs if this is the
case.

I don't think you mentioned whether it was single or dual port heads.
I'm assuming dual port for the next two possibilities.

2. Vacuum leak that's only affecting the back cylinders. Not likely, and
it would only affect you at idle.

3. Blockage in the manifold or head that is keeping 2 and 4 from
breathing. Not likely, but it would cause them not to power up at any
RPM.

On your next post:
&gt; 
&gt; So after eyeballing it for a bit, I decided those little spring clips
&gt; must slip over the arm and settle into the notches on the back of the
&gt; arm.  Anyway, that's what I went with.  Now (of course I've already got
&gt; the engine in) I'm starting to worry that maybe I've got the wrong
&gt; throwout bearing.  Were they different for different year buses and/or
&gt; bugs?  And of course I've already thrown away the box the new one came
&gt; in. 

There are two different styles of throwout bearings. I think the '74 Bug
would have used a different bearing than the '58 or '66 trans, but I've
never had a split case trans or a '70s Bug, so I'll stick to what the
'66 Bus trans would take.

The bearing housing should have cylinders sticking out either side.
Outside diameter of these cyls is probably about 3/8&quot; or 1/2&quot; (workin'
from memory here). Center has about a 1/16&quot; or 3/32&quot; hole that the
straight leg of the retainer clip goes into. The cylinder should fit in
the half-round notches in the back sides of the throwout arms (back is
back, as usual). NOTE: if these half-rounds are more half-oval replace
the throwout shaft (cross shaft).

The bent leg of the clip wraps around the throwout arm when the clip is
turned into the knotch. Getting the clip in the knotch is a bitch
without bending it out so much that it won't stay in, assuming stock
clips (u-shaped with a bent return on one leg). 

The modified clips, which I try to always use, have an extra loop at the
bottom of the U. These spring better and they're easier to tie in.

I tie the two clips together with a piece of picture hanging wire. It's
braided and can handle some flexing without breaking. Tie 'em snug
enough that they can't pull out, but leave some slack for movement.

I'm going to post this to the list so that someone can tell you that the
stock clips are easy to get in, never fall out, and that the Bus will be
heavier with a tie wire back there! :)
