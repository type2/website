Subject: 6v / 12v flywheels

The basic difference between 6v and 12v flywheels is the size and number of
teeth on the flywheel's ring gear.  The 12v is slightly larger, hence the
need to grind out the transmission housing if installing a 12v flywheel in a
6v transmission.  The starter drive gear is also different as is the size of
the starter shaft (and bushing).  Change over bushings are available to
adapt 6v to 12v and vise-versa.  The flywheel to crankshaft sealing is also
different but adaptable.  The 6v flywheels are usually for the small clutch
but I've found a few with the 200 mm clutch.  They're for a late 6v bus I
think?  I hope this helps.
