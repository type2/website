I went there years ago to pick up a 1800 block for my
dad's 72 loaf and I went around back and saw a guy
rattle-canning short blocks with aluminum spraypaint.
Had a bad feeling then, we sold the bus about 2 years
later, the buyer had the engine checked and said it
had weak compression.

&gt; But seriously, I've heard almost nothing but
&gt; heartache about GEX engines.  For every
&gt; &quot;I put one in and drove it forever&quot; story there's 50
&gt; &quot;it's the biggest POS I ever
&gt; saw&quot; counter-stories.
&gt; 
&gt; They're a &quot;volume&quot; shop, and as such, it seems they
&gt; can't afford to pay 
&gt; attention to details and quality.
