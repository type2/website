  &gt; What's a set of these worth nowadays? I found a guy with a 
&gt; complete NOS
&gt; set. If anybody is interested in it, I will inquire further.

Canvas- at least $2000 if split window? Beware several bay window 
tilts trying to be passed as split window. Hoops- $1200-1500+-????
OG hoops selling for $600-800+-, saw a set of very nice SC hoops, og 
bows, &amp; spreader bar for $1000 _at_ BOR last weekend, don't know if they 
will get it?

YMMV,
