Subject: Re: Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW event

I'll support VW as much as they support me.  &quot;Yeah, I need a 211-&quot;&quot;Sorry,
not available.&lt;click&gt;&quot;

On the other hand, that may be changing.  http://www.vw-classicparts_dot_de/
does look interesting.  As far as I can tell with my limited German,
they've only got a small selection (or their sale parts) online, like
two rear brake hoses (211 611 775 B) for Eur 10.  They seem to invite
calls to ask about parts not listed:

Oh yeah, they also have parts manuals.  The scans are better than the
doc project ones, but they're just the pictures - no part numbers:
