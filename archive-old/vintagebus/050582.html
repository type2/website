Subject: Re: [VB] westfalia curtin rods

The Westfailure is a 67, and a walkthru. It has both the tracks on the sides
and windshields, as well as the cab partition track. It ends at the fresh
air vent on each side. There is no sign of a fastening device for the area
under the vent, so I assume the curtains dead ended there. It was an SO-42.

John Flowers writ thusly:

&gt;My camper is a walk-through
&gt; and I don't have a curtain rod that goes between the cab and the rear
area.

Michael Heron had previously written:

&gt;  i did the mental math and came up with 8- one for each of the six window
&gt; and
&gt; and two for the back window. as menioned westy's came with an (optional?)
&gt; cab
&gt; divider curtain rod that follows the curved profile of the cab. you tend
to
&gt; see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they got to so 42's
&gt; they
&gt; petered out
