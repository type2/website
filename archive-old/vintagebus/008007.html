&gt; &gt; I promise to leave you alone if you choose to work here.  At this point,
I
&gt; &gt; don't even want to look at the damn thing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; NQ

hi erin,

    don't give up yet... ugly as it may seem, it's all part of the learning
curve... i just had to buy yet another valve spring compressor for these
chevy springs... hope it works... so far i've busted a berg lash cap, a berg
hardened retainer, and scratched the shafts on two brand new valves.

    someone who knew what they were doing stamped each new valve with the
appropriate number, but i somehow installed a couple of 'em in the wrong
holes... talk about stupid  &lt;vbg&gt;  now i gotta tear it down again... i
wonder if i can get these super-tight lash caps off without having to buy
the puller...

    this is the kind of *&amp;^% that happens when we start out using the wrong
tools for the job... how many decades will it take before i get my mind
right?  :-)
