&gt;Well, I couldn't restrain myself. I just bought the 1961 panelvan with
&gt;&quot;Oxford Radio&quot; signwriting that I posted on Thom's gallery a few weeks
&gt;back.

Cool!  From the photos and your description it sounds like a great find.

On the front view, there appear to be two little discs above the
bumper - are these reflectors?  Are (were) those required by law
there?  Just curious.
 
Besides cars, my other main hobby is electronics.  I seem to be
accumulating some 1960s and 1970s test gear.  When my '64 Standard is
up to being entered in a show, I think I will display it as a &quot;mobile
lab&quot; for some electronics company...put the test gear and a small table
in the back, and rig it up so lights are flashing and meters are 
wiggling.  :)  Something similar might work if you plan to show this
bus...some old radio sets in the back, like you were delivering them
to customers.

&gt;Altogether on the plot where I store them there are 18 splitscreen buses!

But you can stop any time you want...right?  :)

&gt;VIN is 688490, which dates it to June 1961. It would then have been 
&gt;shipped SKD to South Africa for assembly and installation of locally
&gt;sourced parts like batteries, tyres and glass.

I have heard of CKD or &quot;completely knocked down&quot; VWs before...VW would
ship the body panels, running gear, etc to another country where the
body would be welded together and the rest of it bolted on.  Is SKD
the same idea or does it mean something different?
