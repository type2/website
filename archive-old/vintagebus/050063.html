Subject: Re: [VB] more 61 progress


&gt;As much as i hate to spend the money, i think i will just buy a new carb
&gt;when i go to the store tonight, i have one i rebuilt a while ago but i
&gt;took it off my 71 due to some wierdness, i'd hate to blow up this bus
&gt;because i am cheap ;)  Think i will go with a 34 pict as i have the dizzy
&gt;for that carb, and i hear they get the best fuel mileage due to having 3
&gt;circuits, they are just a pain to tune..


I would never buy a 34 carb in a million years.  30/31 series carbs are
much better running, in my experience.
