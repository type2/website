Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Tank Replacement

there was a change- where they introduced the fuel guage the gas tank got a 
hole on top for it  - you could cap this or use a dead sender as a plug if 
your were just running a fuel tap, which I doubt is the case with a 67.  

    In 67 the tanks got humps on top, to allow better for expansion.

But this is one of the cases where one size does fit all, so unless you have 
an early bus and DON'T want the hole, or are concerned about the hump,  who 
cares?

&lt;&lt; Greets, vaunted bus list:
 
 I ordered a replacement tank for my '67 Sondermodel from Wolfsburg West and
 under Type 2 bus gas tanks the description reads: &quot;1955-1967.&quot;
 
 Wow. There were no changes in design to the bus gas tank between 1955 and
 1967?
 
 Or do replacements by nature embody some generic one-deal-fits-all? Just
 curious.
 
 Thanks.
