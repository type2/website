Well, that's interesting...
mine does have some mirrors that match the very description you have given!!  I thought, surely,
that those were aftermarket, though?!?  I'm using one for a wheel block, at present moment!!
(Maybe I should pull that out, heh??)
My seat adjustments sound like a little different, maybe just a model year change, as previously
mentioned... also after more research in Meredith's book.
