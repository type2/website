Subject: The talk about insanity...

Now I am really trying not to take a side one way or
another about the &quot;worth&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of old buses,
because as some of you know, I am a cheap SOB, so I
won't buy something if it is not a VERY good value. My
last daily-driver split window cost me $1100 in the
year 2001, I drove it for a year with nothing more
than a paint job and a new coil, and then traded it
for my current 71 Westy.
  I know, I know everybody says that &quot;A bus is worth
as much as someone is willing to pay for it!&quot;  This is
definitely NOT true in my opinion (notice I said IN MY
OPINION)..
So anyway, here is my serious, non-judgemental
question:  Is the bus in the following ad REALLY worth
$1500, even if someone is willing to pay that??
Heres the ad:

I honestly am not trying to say the seller is asking
too much or that it is out of line, I really want to
know if anyone would ever give $1500 for this bus.


Peace, John Baker
