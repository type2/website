Your &quot;for-sale&quot; emails haven't bothered me yet!... Neither have those from
other tasteful posts of &quot;for-sale&quot; items.

What does bother me is for-sale posts from people who join the list one day,
send a &quot;for-sale&quot; message, then unsubscribe the next.  I feel these lists
create an online community.  I have gotten to know many of you directly.
Sometimes because I call you in response to a &quot;for-sale&quot; add.

Concerning people that have &quot;opinions&quot; about what SPAM is and isn't... There
[delete] key works as well as the next guys.  If they don't like the nature
of the email that is being posted to a list they can register a complaint
with the list administrator, just delete the posts they don't like, or quit
the list.  I assume that our list admin monitors the email and will point
out policy violations to a listee that does something wrong.  I always
question the true motivation of those people who like to take matters into
their own hands and &quot;beatup&quot; on every person that violates thier
&quot;interpretation&quot; of what SPAM is.

Personally I think the idea of putting FS: or For-Sale: at the beginning of
the subject line is a good idea.  This will allow those people who's time is
too valuble to have to wade through the 5-10 &quot;for-sale&quot; ads we get, per
week, to just use a &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;procmail&quot; to avoid ever seeing them!

Sincerely,

Subject: mailing list question regarding SPAM


I have a question to the faithful members of the VW community.  I sent an
email out to the a few of the VW newsgroup lists of which I am a member.  My
question is this, did I just SPAM you?  Apparently, at least one member
thinks I did.  I am aware that conducting business via the VW lists is
against policy.  I've been a member of most of these lists for a couple of
years now, and have attempted to adhere to this policy to the best of my
ability.  I am also of the opinion that most listees welcome the occasional
parts for sale, items for trade, or new products availability announcements
that are posted.  When The Bus Depot announces that hard-to-find German
items
have, once again, become available, I applaud it.  (Ron, you can thank me
later for the plug ;o)  Or when new sheet metal becomes available through
Ronnie at Old Volks Home.  These guys notify people on the list because they
are part of the &quot;list&quot; family themselves.  A lot of times, special deals are
offered to list members only.  I know I offer discounts or free shipping to
list members.  My earlier email was merely an offer to the list members who
are not on my personal email mailing list.  I have this list specifically so
I can send items specials, via p-mail, to those who are interested and not
compromise the integrity of the VW lists.  Unfortunately, my email may have
been taken in offense.  I was told that I &quot;piss off more people than you
please by spamming them.&quot;  I was also told that any unsolicited email was
considered &quot;SPAM&quot;.  Well, I thought that being a member of a newsgroup list
meant that you welcomed it's unsolicited email.  After-all, every email you
get via the lists are &quot;unsolicited&quot; aren't they?  At any rate, I wanted to
pose the question to everyone out there.  If I've offended you or violated
any newsgroup policy, I apologize.  However, I'm sure the list admin. would
have let me know.  Let me know what you think.  I don't want to make this
into another &quot;war of words&quot; on the lists, everyone knows we've had plenty of
those.  So any comments can be p-mailed to me.
