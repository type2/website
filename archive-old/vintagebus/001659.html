Subject: Shims, link pins, and that special VW tool.
Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 23:07:10 -0500

Not much to say tonight.  I installed the MC and adjusted the brake pedal
free play.  Next was to install the torsion arm grease seals and lock the
torsions arms with with grub screws.  I called the guru in order to use his
press and wasn't going to be able to use it until tomorrow so with a little
brain storming, I used some sockets and a bench vise and made my own press.
I pressed out the old link pin bushings and installed the new ones.

Now I referenced Bentley.  It says that by the use of special VW tool
whatever, that the offset of the torsion arms could be measured and then by
referring the chart in the book, I could tell how many washers went where.

Does anyone have this tool or know how to make one?  Looks like I'm going to
need some kind of way to measure this - seems like a pretty critical
adjustment.
