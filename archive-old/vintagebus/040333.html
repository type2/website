Nah,

Bugger it.  Strangely enough, this is turning out to be the most
difficult thing yet!  I've tried em all and can probably round up
everything but a pinion bearing (113 311 219A).  Gees, I mean I found
NOS early link pins here but no pinion bearings!

I see Wolfsburg West have them listed but two people
here have told me that they are of 'south american' origin
and some seem of dubious quality...

I was hoping Ronnie might wade in here with an opinion?

I'll start trying the bearing houses down here next.  I haven't
pulled down the pinion shaft yet (will not do so unless I 
can find the bearing). Can someone tell me what the bearing no. 
is? (as opposed to the VW part no.).......

Thanks

Rob,

You can't get these parts from Bill Mann's or Vintage Vee Dubs in Aus? 
It seems it would be cheaper to go there for the smaller items.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm just at the stage in my 59 23 window resto where
&gt; I want to pull down the transaxle and check it before I put it back
&gt; in the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having real trouble sourcing parts here in Aus. Pinion bearings
&gt; seem to be particularly hard to find.  I see 'rebuilt'
&gt; bus transaxles all the time in the US mags so the parts must be available?
&gt; I'm looking for standard rebuild bits like bearings, gaskets, syncros,
&gt; shims.  Can anyone
&gt; suggest a US supplier with web/email presence?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
