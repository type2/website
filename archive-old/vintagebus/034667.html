Subject: more  53 rusty intake/ 6V&gt;12V conversion?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

just try to find 36hp intake manifold gaskets over the 4th of July weekend.

so after I got them on Wed this things tend to take a while and I finally got 
the manifold off today, I mean yesterday.  Going to the parts store for oil 
(can't have enough) saw Jason driving his 63 bus and hit him up for borrowing 
his drill, as I had finally seemed to kill mine from cleaning outhe 
replacement intake. 

 SOmehow ended up helping pull a motor out of a 63 bug and having a 
discussion about whether or not if you have a 6V car and a 12V FW youcan put 
a 6V solenoid  on a 12V starter and make it work, as the replacement motor 
has a 12V 8 doweled FW and 8 dowled crank, while the car is 6V.  Idea was 
should keep the 8 dowled FW to match crank, so have to have a fitting 
starter.  Any response?  I wanted to try it and ground start the motor with a 
bell housing, but then I split to try to reassemble my bus.  We may never 
know.

Okay, did a nother round with the clutch cable on a drill in the manifold, 
work best if you peel back some of the strands and make srathcy bits to poke 
and grab the crud off the side of the inside of the tube.   I think I want a 
NOS manifold.

Having much already disconnected, I pulled the fan housing up and pulled out 
the generator in the 53 and  undid the manifold bolts.  After removing it I 
found more rust holes THat were not visable from the front.  ick.  POS.  What 
happened to my 50 year warranty?  

As my generator lght came on sometimes at idle, I removed the band and could 
see the brushes worn down.  Got some off a nother little 6V gen, and 
installed them.  SOmehow it seemed more difficult in the 130W gen, as the 
head of the screws holding the brush in was partially blocked by the brush 
itself, while the later 180W ones have the screw facing the other way, a much 
more sensible solution.  

managed to get out the old crush washers for the instake, put the new ones 
in, and proceed with installation.  Assembly is the reverse of the 
dissasembly procedure.  I think it took a couple hours, including replacing 
the fuel line from the tank, the metal one being cracked.   Including bsing , 
and J&amp;N showing up and Jason doing the horn dissembly cleaning reassembly and 
installation on his bus.  It's really loud now, sounds good.

After all that the bus didn't start, seems like the battery is low from the 
sound of the starter, has spark and gas and air.  Hm.  frustrating.  it ought 
to work better now.  Double checked spark plug wires 2 or 3 times.  Started 
great last time, a week ago I think.  

okay, go on picnic today, or fix bus?
