Subject: Lubbock Splitties For Sale

I posted some pictures of the some buses in Lubbock. This is where I got my
'62 23-window. There is a 21-window rolling shell that he'll sell for about
$200. It's what I originally went to look at. It's a big project, but I'm
sure you could get another parts bus in the deal to help out. You can get
to the pictures from the Links page on my site.
