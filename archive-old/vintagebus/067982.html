Subject: Re: [VB] wanted: overhead vent screws!

You can get metric equivalents, albeit without the pointy
ends, at any good h/w store.  I think they used the pointy-end
screws to poke thru the seal upon initial installation.

I'd hate to see you freeze to death out of a desire to be correct.

&gt; um-teen small phillips screws with the pointy ends.  Who has extras they
&gt; won't miss.
