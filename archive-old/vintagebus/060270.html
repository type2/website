Subject: Correct Rim primer?


Looking to blast, prime and paint rims soon. Is the backside, and the
area the tire sits left in grey?  or black? primer for 66? Or is the
entire rim shot L82?
TIA,
Al
PS Missed Sunday VW SuperJam in Maple grove due to refridge. Disaster
(trying to stuff a whole freezers worth inot my 1963 Philco beer fridge,
right...). What a bummer.... :( Never thought that could waste a day....
