Subject: Re: [VB] bumper straightening?

I have a pressed front bumper that is smashed in the middle. How does a
bumper shop straighten a mashed up bumper back to its original shape
without having an good bumper to look at? Wouldn't they need to know the
original shape and curve or at least need to see the bus? I have seen
some rear bus bumpers that seem to curve outward in the middle where I
think they should be straight. just wondering...

Chris in Texas 


&gt; I got my front and rear bumpers, (blades only)straightened at Bumper 
&gt; Boys in
&gt; Los Angeles.  They charged me $100 each, and the looked so good when 
&gt; I got
&gt; them back, that I didn't want to paint them.
