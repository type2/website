&gt; Are there any other suggestions?  How do modern cars vent their gas tanks?

Hi Richard,
You can just buy a chacoal canister from a wrecked 1970s or later VW.  Then 
if you are runing a doghouse shroud (which has the air hose connection on its 
upper right) you can easily rig the same system as used in 1968-71 buses.
