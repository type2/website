 Did anyone else get spammed with a message today announcing the start up of 
a new VW bus only magazine?   They say it's to be called Volkswagen Camper 
and Commercial, and to be put out by the same Brit group that does Total 
VW.... I have no ties with them, but will forward the site if anyone is 
interested -- http://www.volkswagencamper.co_dot_uk
