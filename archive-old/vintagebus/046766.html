&gt;  I recently acquired a very complete/origial 1966 Model
&gt;  221 Std.  The colors are velvet green below and off
&gt;  white above the belt line. When I pull up the color
&gt;  charts on www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com and register the bus
&gt;  on Thom's site, it shows the interior as mesh gray. 
&gt;  However, the interior is more of a salt/pepper seat
&gt;  tops and middle of panels and dark green (ok, maybe
&gt;  gray) on the panel tops/bottoms and seat sides/back. 
&gt;  Plus, the piping on the panels is definitely green.

sounds like you are describing the interior VW calls mesh grey.  commonly 
called salt and pepper.   VW did not call the interior salt and pepper.  used 
another word.  ya- the grey can go green, but is 'grey'
