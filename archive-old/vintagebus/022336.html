Well, I bought my first Type 2 one week ago tonight, a '64 SC.  I paid
$1600 for it, and this is what I got:

solid bus, but needs rockers
Dual treasure chest doors
good cab floors
fairly beat-up gates
rust hole in treasure chest floor.
Wavy bed
Never wrecked
New tranny/40-horse
New tires
90% complete

Here's a pic as of tonight: http://www.softcom_dot_net/users/tmink/64sc3.jpg

&gt;I have a 60 SC that I am supposedly purchasing in the next week or two.  
&gt;Since it has been a few years since owning any splits and having never owned 
&gt;a SC, I would like some ballpark figures of what I should be paying for this 
&gt;one.
&gt;
&gt;heres the basics...
&gt;no engine
&gt;cracked windscreen
&gt;wrong wheels
&gt;two fist size holes on each side in front floor
&gt;undercarriage out-riggers perfect
&gt;not wrecked
&gt;rusted rockers,battery tray, misc, nicks/chips
&gt;painted really crappy white/blue
&gt;wiring is toasted, and rigged up.
&gt;brakes are completly toast
&gt;
&gt;but it is pretty solid, and almost complete
&gt;the side gates are excellent, with all latches
&gt;passed missouri inspection in fall 96
&gt;has both bumpers all lights, visors, mirrors, seats,everything
&gt;has a basket case 36 hp that can go with it.
&gt;front beam,steering box suspension good.
&gt;
&gt;if anyone has real experience with sc's i will have some pics developed in 
&gt;the next couple days and i could send some to you and have you give me a 
&gt;ball-park figure.
&gt;
&gt;any help would be appreciated,
&gt;
&gt;have fun,
&gt;zac
&gt;omaha,ne.
