look to the right of the apron just to the right of the screw hole that holds

There has been some metal replaced in the engine
bay this bus was a German bus I.E. no port of import stamp. This was a rusty
bus I think that the vin number might have been plated over when this area was
worked on. I Have done a quick search on The Samba to find a photo of a vin
number stamped into a engine bay. Clara can you help? TIA Mike
