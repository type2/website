Next Question: Does anyone make E-brake cables for this conversion?  
It is my understanding that you need shorter? cables.

thanks again

&gt; What 'u-shaped adapter' did you try?  I've done this conversion a couple 
&gt; of times now with no problems.  You need the later type2 nose cone
&gt; and the *bus* (NOT BUG) adapter made by either Wolfgang or BusBoys.  I
&gt; ran my '56 kombi this way for several years, and it's still running around
&gt; Arizona to this day.  I also put one in my '55 westy, and it's running
&gt; around Japan now.
&gt; 
&gt; The downside is you'll get more tranny noise, because it's a solid piece.
&gt; I don't know of anyone who's made one with a rubber isolater; probably not
&gt; enough of a market for it.  I partially solved the problem by squeezing a
&gt; 1/4&quot; piece of rubber sheet between the mount and the body, which reduced
&gt; the noise a little.  In a crew cab it's probably not as big of a deal.

&gt; &gt; Hello fellow bus people, I am putting a '67 tranny into my '59 crew cab
&gt; next
&gt; &gt; spring.  The problem is the crew cab
&gt; &gt; has a split case tranny that mounts differently than the later tranny.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; have tried a little u-shaped adaptor on my 
&gt; &gt; '58 panel but did not like the way it fit up.  Does anyone know of a
&gt; better
&gt; &gt; adaptor to use.  Any advice is always
&gt; &gt; appreciated.  thank you
