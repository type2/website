&gt; Can louvered westy windows be changed back to pop outs.

Hi Mike,
They can but we suggest keeping two in the rear for insect free ventilation 
when parked especially!  As for installing pop-outs you could always look for 
&quot;Technical Bulletin A 6&quot; for installing them.
Does anyone else have some of these &quot;Technical Bulletins&quot;?
