Subject: Re: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

Finally! Someone else has discovered this nightmare
too! Restored is NOT original just as NOS is not REPO!
I have seen that term mis-used a million times, even
to the point where an award was given to a very nice
bus that won best original bus but was actually
restored. 
Perhaps the problem is that too many people left
school before they were ready!

&gt; Am I the one that's confused? On Everett's site
&gt; there's a 1964 crew cab for
&gt; sale from Georgia.
&gt; The owner states: &quot;It was restored about 8 years ago
&gt; and garage kept since.&quot;
&gt; Then in the same paragraph he writes &quot;It's all
&gt; original and about as nice as
&gt; they come.&quot;
&gt; As far as I know, &quot;restored&quot; and &quot;original&quot; are
&gt; contradictory terms.
&gt; Or has this changed since I left school?
