Thom spake:
&gt;Finally got enough of the OS installed that I could post pix:

Sweet score, '55s rule!

It seems there are a lot of '55 Trucks in Sacramento, my friend said there
was one for $750 within the past year as well.  And didn't Thom post one he
saw for sale in the papers in Sac a while back?  And the one he found in the
junkyard with the rad logos?

Or maybe I just have a photographic '55 Bus memory...
