Subject: New List for bugs

Hey All,
I know this is marginal content, but it's friday so I think I can slip it in.
I want to invite any bus owners (there is the mandatory bus content!)who also
own a VW bug to join a new mailing list focussed on the Air cooled Bug. I am a
long time bus owner, but I have also owned a few air cooled bugs. When I was
working on those bugs, I found it difficult to find out much information about
the technical side of the bug. As a matter of fact, most of the stuff I
learned about the bug I learned from the T2 and VB lists. On the web I have
found a bunch of enthusiasts' pages and lists but it seemed there was no
really good list for technical info or advice on how to work on the bug. So I
am starting a new list for this. I would like to see it become the Bug
equivalent of the T2 and VB lists, where bug owners can share technical advice
and tips. I would especially love to get a lot folks who own both Bugs AND
Buses, because that gives us a whole other perspective on many issues (i.e.
when is an .009 dizzy useful!)  Anyway, consider this an invitation to join
the newly formed VWtype1 list. Here is the link for the list page:
http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/VWtype1/
I hope to see many of you there!
Thanks for your time.

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
