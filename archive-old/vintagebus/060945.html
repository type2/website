Subject: fabricating &amp; installing new front door panels

i just installed some new door panels on my bus and wanted to share the
experience fora nayone else who may try to do this.

herewith the story:

The previous owner had purchased some of the repro door panels for my '65=

kombi-he did not do  the best job installing, and did not put any plastic=

coating on the back-so they warped to all heck, and the pop pins tore the=

holes he made-making them much larger. =


I wanted to replace them, as at that point there was only a couple of the=
 pins
able to hold the panel on-it was always flapping around....so i flattened=
 them
out as best as i could-wet them down, them put heavy weights on them. I t=
hen
bought some type of hardened masonite with some type of slick waterprooki=
ng
stuff on one side-i think it can be used in showers actually. It comes in=
 a
4'x8'x1/8&quot; sheet at home depot -less than $15 i think, and large enough f=
or 3
panels probably.

I used the old panels as templates, and cut out the new ones first one wi=
th a
jig saw and a snader to smooth out the cuts, then I used a router and a
template cutting bit to get an exact match. I then got some double sided =
tape
put that on the slick side, and then put some real thick plastic(aka
construction weight trash bags) on the back. Next I painted the plain har=
dened
masonite surface with some grey spray paint that leaves a slightly textur=
ed
appearance, i think it was called engine rebuilders grey.

The next step was to prep the doors-I cleaned out the door with some basi=
c
cleaner-like simple green i think, to get rid of the majority of the dirt=
 in
it. then i went through the por-15 steps finishing with por-15 on the bot=
tom
of the door, and the seams near the bottom, as well as any rust spots i s=
aw on
the inside of the door. Then I installed some viscoelastic polymer stuff(=
self
adhesive sound dampener) on the inside of the doors. I got this from Mcma=
ster
carr ~ $20 for a sheet whcih was plenty for doing the doors. This make th=
e
doors sound real solid when you shut them, and it is completely waterproo=
f.

Next I installed some plastic wall anchors in the door. I got some stainl=
ess
steel screws and finish washers( I didn't like dealing with those push ri=
vet
things). First I tried drilling pilot holes in the panel that would line =
up
with the wall anchors-big mistake. nothing quite matched up right, and I =
ended
up with a couple extra holes. for the second door I clamped the panel in =
place
using those squeeze type clamps with the rubber boots to protect the door=

surface. I clamped the panel where it wanted to go, then using the drill =
with
a screwdriver bit, basically lined the screws up with the wall anchors an=
d
drilled them in, letting the screw make the hole. the best way to &quot;find t=
he
wall anchor location&quot; was to just stab a screwdriver between the door pan=
el
and the door, and gently pry the panel up-locate the anchor and eyeball w=
here
to drive the screw in.

everything about this process was good...except the old panels had either=

shrunk some or were never the right size, because the new panels are abou=
t a
1/4&quot;-1/2&quot; too small all the way around. has anybody made templates for th=
ese?
Also I should have probably put some proective coating on top of the spra=
y
paint-like polyurethane to keep the paint from getting markd up so easily=
=2E


Now the doors sound nice and solid-when I have time I will try to make th=
em
again, just a little bit bigger.

hope that helps any others
