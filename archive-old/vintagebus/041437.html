Sounds like mine, but I admit I may have caused the leak by hard
use.  I think the stuff can flex in there and push on the flange and
sideplate.


&gt; Any suggestions? 
New Sideplate?  New flange?  I have purchased some heavy duty sidecover
savers for mine someday when I decide to pull it all.  These are
1/4&quot; steel covers that go on the flange that the boot goes on.  You have
to change the studs that the sidecover mounts to also.  They make these
things as a two piece (split) or one piece, but for the one piece you have
to press the axle tube off the reduction box to install it.    

Do I really have to pull the engine
&gt; and trans to get in there?
Yes if you have to mess with the sideplate.  I think you can tighten the
nuts on a 67, but not sure.  I know my 58 with a 12V transmission it is
not possible to get at.  I think what may happen often times is that the
flange gets bent?  It's not a very thick piece of metal.

&gt;Is this a rare problem?
I don't know, but I figure there's no reason it should be a leaker.
Your leak sounds more severe than mine, I'd want to get it taken care of
just so I didn't make a mess everywhere I go and have the persistent smell
of gear oil.  (Mine doesn't smell bad now that I have Redline synthetic,
but the guy at Rancho said they have trouble not having leaks using
synthetic, so that's something to think about too.  The Redline has much
less viscosity at ambient temps than regular gear oil.)
