Subject: RE: [VB] re:tranny rebuild

I live in MA too and had Ronnie build me a 4.12 big nut.  It runs great,
very tight, smooth shifting.  I highly recommend Old Volks.

i have never used mofoco, but i believe that is one of the companies that
has been more than bad mouthed in discussions...ie i would not reccommend
them.
