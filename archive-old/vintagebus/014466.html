Subject: Checked out my torsion bars...
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

&gt;&gt;Just got my bus ('64) back from the mechanic.  He says he thinks the front
torsion bars are &quot;froze up&quot;.  This is not why I had it in the shop, and I have
not noticed any thing strange about the ride at all.  He says &quot;that's why it
rides so hard&quot;.  Don't all buses ride somewhat hard?  Is there some way I can
be sure this guy isnt messing with me?  By the way, he said he wouldnt want to
try and fix it even if it was broken.
&quot;Too much trouble&quot;  What do you guys think?  Is there something i can look
for?&lt;&lt;


Hi all,

Per a lot of your instructions, I got my wife (with a little coaxing) to
bounce up and down on the front bumper while I took a look underneath at the
torsion arms,
and sure enough they DO move.  Not a lot mind you, like 1/2&quot;-1&quot; but then again
my wife weighs around 145lbs.  (this is just a guess, she'll never tell me)
Does this sound about right?  I can't really notice anything wrong with the
ride, not having driven any other buses but this one.  Oh yeah, P.O. installed
KYB shocks recently, maybe this accounts for the firmer ride?  Time to switch
mechanics, anyone have any suggestions in the Chicago-NW Indiana area?

Thanks much for the help.
