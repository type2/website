FWIW, the Bentley reproduction is still only $59 (plus shipping) from
J.C. Whitney's VW specialty catalog.  Yep, it's the exact same book in
the original shrinkwrap.  Served me very well until I splurged for a set
of the original 2-volume VWAG Workshop Manual from that infamous
internet auction site.

&gt; Well, I finally splurged and bought the Robert Bentley Workshop Manual for
&gt; the VW Transporter 1963-1967. THIS THING IS HUGE.  I just wanted to let
&gt; everyone know about this thing.  If you haven't put out the $80.19 yet (this
&gt; was my total cost with 2 day shipping), it's worth it.  Lots of pictures,
&gt; and information. It's going to take me a few weeks to read it all (hey, it's
&gt; more fun than reading the dictionary). Only thing I wish it would have, is
&gt; color wiring diagrams. But it even has cool pictures of the ambulance stuff,
&gt; and how to remove it.  Like the Rotary Emergency Light, Ambulance Fans,
&gt; Spotlight, Red Cross Light, and Speedometer Reverse Switch. All cool stuff.
