Clara &amp; vintagees...
	okay... I understand sort of now why it's a good thing for the fresh
air hoses to be there... although I do not think it would be a bad thing
to use some kind of heavy duty metal air hoses from the heater boxes to
the &quot;Y&quot; duct-piece ends... 
	BTW, I drove my '70 just over a hundred miles last weekend with the
heater outlets on the fan housing plugged (and heater flaps closed), and
didn't have the melting problem that Clara did... go figure.

&gt; This taught me that...  The heater boxes get much much hot w/o the fresh air
&gt; tube in place, whether or not the heat is on (it never melted before until the
&gt; fresh air tube was shut off).  They shouldn't melt the plastic tube there-
&gt; they need that fresh air tube badly (got one asap)
&gt; 
&gt; and made me think - hm they must cool the exhaust, and make the engine run
&gt; cooler.
