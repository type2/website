Holey-moley!!! He wants the elusive car show dee-lucks kit. MX code 1002. I


all i've got to say is DONT DO IT!  ITS NOT WORTH IT!  I bought my bus in
running, driving, ugly but solid condition.  I immediately dove in to the
&quot;show quality&quot; restoration.  I have spent a bit over 10,000 and have never had
the opportunity to drive my bus in the 2 years I have owned it.  I would have
to say that I TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT.  MX Code 1002 is one to avoid.

I had an interesting conversatin about this recently.   My feeling is that
these old buses are vehicles, ie I want to drive it.     This means I get a
bus, and I drive it around, and fix all the mechanicals.  Some at once (brakes
etc) some later (wing window latch broken etc).    I actually did, under
pressure and encouragement and help  from my boyfriend transfer my ugly
65westy into a pretty 65 westy by rust repair.straightening.painting.     Very
wierd.    There would be no way I'd have gotten it, done all that first, and
got it all back togther.   Pulling it apart to paint was easy, As I had worked
on it enough that many things had already had the rust broken loose and the
threads greased :).  

But to do that at first is Too much at once.    I see people who get a bus,
and pull it apart and it sits for years while the mice eat the pieces of it.
Then again, maybe I am scared of shiny cars.  Hey if you want the shiny
trinkets and feel like throwing money at people, go ahead.  I want a green and
white striped tent now, and would like to throw money at someone for it (I
have a 67 kombi for sale, newly sealed windsheilds,  would help finance my
westy tent purchase).       So   the funny thing in this conversation was i
was talking about how it is wierd that I painted my springplates, and few
people would do so, and he said a lot of his friends would do that, and I
eventually  realised really it is because you can consider your bus a toy/
project, or transportation.     I have my bus as transportation.    Painting
springplates is gucci, like, do you really drive the thing?    So now I have a
split personality.    Yes, it is also an ongoing project, but the every so
often kind (I want to switch my shift stick knob back to stock now).  Okay, I
admit I am always futzing with something on some VW, but that's cause I like
to, and am scared of just having one and it being a toy, or being finished and
too nice to drive.    I drive my aircooled volkswagen.   I like to.    I have
several so I can drive a different one if I suddenly need to fix the other.
Sad, isn't it.  Maybe I need therapy.     Hey if you can buy a ambulance fan
go for it.      But it's too rainy to drive with the safaris these days.
When is summer?
