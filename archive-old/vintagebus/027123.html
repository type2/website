Subject: Re: An interesting bus story..

NQ,
You know that I know about sheet metal replacement. My bus weighs twice
as much as when I bought it with all it's new metal. If you can
eliminate much of the bodywork and focus on the mechanicals with the
'Spooky&quot; bus I would say go for it. Besides wouldn't it honour the poor
soul that was killed to give his bus new life instead of having it
rotting away in a field?
By the way, what's the word on the motor movie. My offer to put it on
the Omaha VW Club server still stand. I can do the conversion and
everything
