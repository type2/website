Subject: Re: Upholstery work

&gt; From: &quot;Ed Richardson&quot; &lt;edr_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; start thinking about the upholstery work.  I need to do the 2 cushions 
&gt; on
&gt; the Z-Bed, the 2 cushions on the jump seat, (I have a walkthru), and 
&gt; the
&gt; cushion behind the Z-Bed that goes above the engine bay.

Depending on what you have, consider doing at least some if it 
yourself.  Cushions on the bed (assuming you mean a westy bed, not a 
regular seat with the foldout adapter) are square and just stapled on 
underneath (seatback may or may not have fabric on the rear side).  I 
redid the bed (from a 71 westy) in the back of my 65 that way - very 
easy to make the folds at the corners.  Armrest on passenger side 
wasn't tough either, and I'd bet the jumpseat is done pretty much the 
same way.  Only real kicker is the engine bay cushion -- right now I 
just have a big piece of the bed fabric spread across it and tucked 
under like a bedsheet and it looks fine.  If the material's not too 
heavy you can make an &quot;envelope&quot; for the cushion with &quot;Stitch Witchery&quot; 
or similar ironable fabric &quot;glue&quot; and never thread a needle.

If the seat covers were pleated or piped it would be another matter, 
but the camper stuff is (IMO) more like simple home upholstery: 
scissors and staple gun will take you a long way.

Good luck!  I just wish it were as simple to recover the front 1/3-2/3 
bench in my 65.  Look like dogchit.
