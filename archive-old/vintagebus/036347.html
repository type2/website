I know of two ways in WA state but I would guess it is on a state by state basis. In most places I think it even depends on who you happen to deal with on that day.

One way is to get the vehicle declared &quot;a junk vehicle&quot;. I had to have the sheriff come out and declare the vehicle junk. In the condition it was in this was not hard. At that point I could take the junk vehicle report in and re title it using that. This was a pretty obscure loophole that a friend found in a WA state law book.

Another way is to apply for no title registeration. This gives you registeration but no title for a period of I think a year. If no one claims the vehicle after that time they give you the clean title.

Hope this helps although I do not know if either one applies to your situation.
