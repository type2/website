I do not believe my Jan, 1955 Kombi has the correct headlight assemblies.

I wish to locate a 'correct' set.  I have located a pair of what should be

original '58 lenses.  Are they different than pre-March, 1955?  I know '55

should be Hella and 'fluted' but other than that, what is the difference?

Is it just the glass lens or more than that?  I will be staying with the

sealed beam setup, since I have a US-delivered vehicle.

well, first of all one question is - is yours a us spec or euro spec bus-
where was it first sold?

the other question is did barndoors sold in the US have fluted lenses or did
they come with the sealed beam set up.

The 54 kombi  that I used to haev was sold in the us, in Kenniwick, WA.    It
had the original laminated windsheilds.  It had sealed beam headlights when I
first saw it, but I don't know if they had been switched or if they were
original.     So I don't know the answer to the second question.

So, what we did for the 54 was give it the early style sealed beam headlight
lenses (non fluted.   Used the earlier lens, that  was the lens with the
'loose' VW logo that is bigger.  I don't know if that makes sense.   I hope
so.  I can't scan a picture.

The US spec &quot;sealed beam&quot; have the big bulbs and clear glass with the little
bit of striping at the side.

The Fluted lenses have- well, 'fluting'
