I have been to shows in Cal, Arizona, Idaho, Wisconsin, Oregon and
Washington, and with a very few exceptions, the shows are mostly a
rip-off, with promoters of dubious loyalty to the hobby, and a lot of
really great people as spectators and entrants and swappers. Exceptions
are the Boise Family Reunion, a totally free vw weekend, and the Vinatge
Meet in Seattle, run suprisingly well by the very disorganized Cascade
Kombis. 

Sacramento has to be the absolute tops for rip-offs. It has cost me $70
to get in to gates there. I have always gone ahead and paid because I
know I can sell stuff to the relatively cash-flush Californians, and
because the turn-out is good and there are alot of good people I like to
see. I met Eric and Barb there my first time, and Thom a couple years
later. 

My main gripe other than the cost to enter and swap, is the idiot they
always pick to talk on the drag strip loudspeaker. At Woodburn, Oregon,
I think a prerequisite to being the dragstrip Emcee is to hate VWs and
to have a whole ford pick-up load of snide comments. Not knowing the
difference between types I II and III helps too. 

But then you should have seen the guy the had on the loudspeaker at the
Jurassic Bug In in Corvallis. Talk about a big dumb idiot!

&gt;       While we're on the topic of show rip offs. I'd like to add the Bugout
&gt; held in Manassas Virgina.

&gt;  I guess my problem is with
&gt; the promotors more than anything.
