&gt; Whats Sta Lube??


Sta Lube is a brand name for tranny oil products and their cute lil' pump.

&gt; Is the gizmo Cal like a screw in spring loaded pump, that you push down
&gt; on to get the oil into the trans ?

It's got a handle that you push down on, it screws onto their bottles of
oil.

&gt; If so--I've been using a Mercury Marine lower unit pump that works the
&gt; same--
&gt; I got it at a ships store to put the gear oil in the outdrive--works
&gt; great with any gear oil.
&gt; For 5 bucks it's a great tool to have in stock.

Sounds really good. Something I should investigate.
