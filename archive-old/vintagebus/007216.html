Have I got a deal for some lucky list member!

I've got an extra battery tray for a pick-up. I would really like to swap it
for a battery cover and strap for a 12V battery (my pick-up is a '65
converted to 12V).

This piece is from Das Bulli. Really heavy, solid stuff. It will probably
withstand all that nasty battery acid stuff, discussed on the list for the
last few days, for quite a while.

If no one has a battery cover, I guess I'll sell it to someone for a good
price. Although its for a pick-up, I guess it would be pretty easy to shape
it to fit a transporter.

Steve B.
