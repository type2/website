Subject: Mexican Rear Slider Windows
Message-ID: &lt;c88ed945.2481a72f_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello Lists-
   I was perusing that page of Mexibus brochures and noticed the top of the 
line caravelle model has the late bay and Vanagon sliding windows... also 
looks like it has rear sliders in the space behind the cargo doors.  I saw 
these once in S. African photo and wonder if they are available from VW of 
Mexico?  Any links or ideas?
