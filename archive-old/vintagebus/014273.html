Naw, man.. this stuff builds character!  I've made that mistake before, you
know, go full balls into a project only to have it burn you out.  Just put the
bus in the shed for about 3 months.  You will be able to face it again.  Don't
think about it, or do ANYTHING with it.  Go to other projects.  And pay off
the bills in the meantime.  

Remember how to eat an elephant.  (one bite at a time!)  Even the overwhelming
problem with rust seem small when done a little at a time.
