 hello
 
 i have a 1600cc dp with headers and i was wondering if it is possible to
 take off the heat exchangers and have no negative effects.
 &gt;&gt;

I consider lack of a heating system a negative effect, but that's just me.

even if you use a gas (h)eater, it is good (comfort wise in cold weather, and 
pocket wise for gas use) to have the stock heat.
