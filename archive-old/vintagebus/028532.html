Steve,

Some clutch disks have springs in them. I've seen these springs break
and when they do, the little broken pieces get scatered around in the
space between the flywheel and pressure plate. Some of them can be big
enough to rub the edge of the clutch disk, which would make the clutch
drag. I only buy the solid center disks since I had this happen to me.

You could also have corrosion on the trans input shaft that's keeping
your clutch disk from moving away from the flywheel when you step on the
clutch.

There's a couple more things to look for.
Hope that helps.
