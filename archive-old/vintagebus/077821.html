Subject: Re: [VB] NEW Interior mirrors/more specials

Actually after I sent the post I realised I had done a typo, I meant to say the symmetrical mirror was for 55-64, the offset started in 65.   So after Ronnie said it was mid 66 I pulled out the parts list which shows the change at ch 215 099 006, after which there are LHD and RHD versions.  

So it looks like a mid 65 model year change (3 Feb 1965)

 looks like a copy of the 55-65 mirror.   66-67 had a wider glass with the stalk offset, and the stalk of the 67 one was thicker when it screws to the bus than the 65-67 version.
