Subject: Re: [VB] Re: front seal

This is not the first time I have heard of this.  My
shopmate, Barry, had this same thing happen to him
recently:  pulled the flywheel and the cam plug fell
right out.  Guess we better start figuring out the
best sealer for these.  One more thing to worry about
on my 1776 - sheesh!

&gt; I had a similar problem when I put in a new
&gt; Brazilian case with a rubber
&gt; cam plug instead of the old metal &quot;bottle top&quot; cam
&gt; plug.  All the
&gt; symptoms were like a bad seal.  I pulled the clutch
&gt; and flywheel only to
&gt; have the rubber plug fall on the ground.
