Now, you must realize I'm new to this group before I ask this question.  
But, there seems to be a bit of controversy regarding selling buses (or 
really any car for that matter) to the Japanese market.  Why is everyone so 
interested in buying them over there...and what is the problem with shipping 
them to be sold in Japan?  Someone mentioned something about ethics involved 
in this.  Could you guys please inform me.
