Subject: AZ VW Bus Club event this weekend-Phoenix
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Please consider joining the folks of the AZ Bus club at the White Tank
Recreation Park for an overnight campout and check out the fireworks.
Sentence structure aside, it should be mostly family oriented and safe fun!

Directions:
* I-10 to Cotton Lane exit
* North to Olive. Avenue
* West on Olive until it ends at the Park's entry gate. 

(If coming from the north just make it to Olive Avenue and go as far West as
possible.)

Please ask the attendant for the specific areas name or number. 
Once inside the park:
*Proceed to the Northwest and wind around watching for a bunch of buses and
other vehicles on the West side of the park's road.

Price is nominal if at all. Some hard cores are camping on Friday and
Saturday. We anticipate that the view of the the Phoenix Metro area's
fireworks will be possible. Come and have fun. At 110F my wife and I will be
sneaking out there at sundown on Saturday and staying the night... Bring
plenty of water and other liquids of your choice. Sunscreen and Tents are
recommended. Someone mentioned something about an above ground pool... ~
only in Arizona ~ =)
