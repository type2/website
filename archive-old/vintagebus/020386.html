&gt; Ok, so this is the really bad wheel.  wet black crud everywhere, the rubber
&gt; seal on the top wheel cylinder is torn and sitting off to the side.  It's a
&gt; mess.

The rubber thing on the *outside* of the cylinder is just a dust boot - 
being torn in and of itself isn't fatal.

&gt; I haven't done brakes in awhile, so I have some dumb questions.  I think the
&gt; correct thing to do here would be to replace all four front wheel cylinders.
&gt; Not to mention the bearings.  But of course this happens at a time when I'm
&gt; flat broke.  What would be the minimum &quot;just-for-now&quot; fix-it job?  Is there
&gt; anything I'm overlooking here?

The best fix if you're short on dough would be to buy a rebuild kit and fix
the cylinders on that wheel.  I hear NAPA has them.  Clean everything up and
re-assember, then save your dough for a thorough brake job.  Try re-greasing
the bearing and adjusting properly and see if you can squeeze a few more miles
out of it.
