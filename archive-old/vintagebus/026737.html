&gt; check your back issues of HOT VWs they have a little section on rarest of the
&gt; rare once a year.

Every July in the &quot;Vintage Issue&quot;.................funny that of all the pieces
I've seen as &quot;hard to find&quot; or &quot;rare&quot; on eBay never make into that
issue.........8-)

If all that eBay stuff is really that rare then I've got enough rare piece to
retire on, now if I could just find someone to buy it all. I guess I gave away a
set of &quot;hard to find&quot; low hinge panel doors last weekend to Taylor for $30.00,
maybe I'll put the other set on eBay and make up the difference there ;-)
