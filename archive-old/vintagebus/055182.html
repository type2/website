Subject: Westy repo roof racks

    For those that want to see them in person I will have the 3 I have left
at Pomona this weekend. These are the Westy racks made in Taiwan, a decent
reproduction. After I figured it out, it takes an hour to assemble. They go
together easy with no modes needed. A functional rack at a decent price, not
SHOW quality but great for a bus that gets used.
