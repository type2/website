What type of fastener is used to retain the rear luggage bar tube to the
center support? Is it a set screw? Mine is missing and the tube as well as
the support have holes thru them. Is the tube supposed to have a hole? Which
part is supposed to be threaded? Does anyone know what size the thread is
supposed to be? Anyone know a source for the end plugs?

Thanks,
Paul Dotson
