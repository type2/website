Me and the misses took the 'ol 62 out on the town las night. We went down to
the 7-11 and filled her slap to the top!  Had the oil looked at also,
everything was jus fine and dandy. After the short lay over at the convenience
store, we headed down to the local fish and chips establishment. After dinner
I was feeling adventurous, talked my 'ol lady into cruisin the strip, now I
don't mix it up with the younger set very much, but I tell ya, it's not like
it used to be!
Well aanyways the whole night went by real well, and without a hitch I might
add.
