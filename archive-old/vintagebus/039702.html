&gt;was it a 63 with the optional big brakes?
No, t'is a 70's but I thought the post still applied to splitties as well, 
hence the cross post.

&gt;I am having brake woes with my 65 westy.  pulls to left.
Are they adjusted properly and have you bled them lately?

&gt;  drums look okay but I am thinking of getting them turned.  I know &gt;some 
&gt;people swear by drum turning, but I would rather not take more &gt;metal off 
&gt;the drums unless it really needs it.   no big grooves.   I &gt;use 80 grit 
&gt;sandpaper in the drums perpendicular to the
&gt;direction of spin to break any glaze. hm what are the specs on min 
&gt; &gt;thickness?
Do you feel a pulsing in your brake pedal when you step on the brakes?  
That's a big hint that the drums need turning.  Maximum allowable drum 
diameter can be found in your Bentley, mine's in the Tinkertoy and not 
readily available.  I'll turn if the drum seem warped or have more rust than 
I'm comfortable trying to sand by hand, taking the minimum amount I can.  
It's getting harder to find drums and such.

&gt;lying underneath I can reach the brake lever with one hand and spin &gt;the 
&gt;tire with another (when it is jacked up) and it seems the right &gt;wheel just 
&gt;doesn't stop so good.   which makes sense with it pulling &gt;left.
Again, sounds like you should try a bleed and adjust first.  If the adjust 
doesn't help, I'd suggest checking the hoses next.  Could also be gunk in 
the metal line to that wheel.  You did not mention if the right side brake 
shoes showed signs of being soaked with brake fluid so without looking I 
can't rule it out or point to that as a contributing factor.  I suspect 
that's not the case though because you say the wheel cylinders are not 
leaking.  When you bleed the brakes, pay particular attention to the 
condition on the fluid coming out.  Is it dark and chunky like a good cup of 
coffee?  That's only good in coffee, a bad thing in your braking system.

Good luck, and let us know what you find out.
