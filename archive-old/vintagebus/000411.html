&lt;&lt; I have a 65 Crew Cab. The apron on it looks funky. I think I remember from
 my other busses that the part of the apron that has the cut-out for the pig
 tail is supposed to be vertical to the ground.
 
 On my Crew, that part of the apron is horizontal to the ground. It doesn't
 look like it has been bent, indeed, it seems that it was made that way. Is
 the apron on the 65 Crew different from the 65 Transporter?
  &gt;&gt;
yes, for a 65 there should be a half circle indent for the tailpipe.

a truck apron is not different than a non truck

sounds like you have one from a earlier /36hp Type II.  does your apron have 
a hole for a crank?
