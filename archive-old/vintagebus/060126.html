Subject: rear corner panel

I recently bought 2 NOS rear corner panel, i just need one, the passenger
side.

On the panel its says bus 1954-1964

I have a bus 1960

BUT, the round hole for the tailight is very round and about 1 inch higher
than my 60 tail light hole ...

Is that a shame if i cut it to fit my corner?? my first thought was they
were made for 54+ tail light ...

If yes, anybody want to exchange for 1960 NOS one ?

mike
