Subject: Clutch/trans problem

Hello all

When I got in my 67 bus at the local grocery store, I put the clutch in just
before turning the key, and I heard a light &quot;ping&quot; sound. Never heard that
before.... I turned the key and she started right up, as usual..  However,
when I went to put the trans in reverse, it was difficult, but it went in.
I backed up, and went to engage 1st gear and it would not go into gear.  I
could get it in 3rd, and used that to get myself home, only about a half
mile.  Again difficult, but I could get it in reverse to back into the
garage, but when I again tried to put it in 1st, it will not go.
Interesting, when I turn the engine off, the trans works through all the
gears like it always has, nice and smooth.  I have never had a problem with
the trans before.  I crawled under the bus, and I can see the clutch cable
is fraying on the tranny side, with about half the strands broken.  It still
looks like it should work, however.  I have ordered a new clutch cable, but
I think my problem is more serious????

What do you folks think mught be the problem??   Any insights would be
really appreciated.

Thanks!!

Bob
