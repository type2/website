Subject: No start not ground related, fuel pump... won't

I am not sure if I am not getting a fast enough, long enough spin out of my
aged battery, or if the engine builder got a defective pump, or no rod! No
fuel at all to carb, I have got several starting revolutions, seems I should
have gas by now. Is there an RPM min to get the pump to go? I tried priming
with a syringe, no luck, this thing didn't even get the air out of the lower
supply line, came out when I pulled to check for gas from tank. Any
suggestions before I buy a new pump and rod and go in there?
Al
