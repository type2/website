Thanks to my good friend Don Boneau, I'm partially on my way to locating
this Porsche 356 pulley arrangment to spool my fan up faster in my freeway
flier bus so that I can make the Kansas City VW show with minimal worries
about overheating.

Don actually called me up last night and we had a nice chat over various
topics.  He politely reminded me that he had told me the idea of using the
356 pulley way back when but that I had forgot.  He said the mind is the 2nd
thing to go so I would assume a person's libido is the first.

I called up Performance Products and they happened to have the inner and
outer pulleys for a 356 and I got them sent to me for $41.00 ($15.00 2nd
day) - it would have been $27 to have them next day so I thought that
arriving on Thursday wouldn't be so bad - I can still put it on rather
quickly.

The only thing left is the nut that goes with the pulley. This place and one
other that I called would have to &quot;order&quot; it so I'm going to check a few
more places to see what I can come up with.  So far so good...
