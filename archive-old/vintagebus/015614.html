Hi Kevin,
***********
Do you have pics of your EZ Camper posted anywhere? I'm doing the same with
mine and was wondering what your cab looks like.
***********
I don't have any pictures with me, or on the net...maybe I can try when I
return to the states. Actually I am pretty sure I will do that, because I will
want to have some record of the original interior. I will then either be able
to post them to a webpage, or I could email them to you. 
***********
What are your door panels made of and do you know if they are original? 
***********
Do you mean the front door panels or the cargo door panels....My front door
panels are repros installed by the previous owner. I believe he got them from
Wolfsburg West. They are grey with a slight texture to them. They are pretty
close to the front kick panels which are original. The front door panels are
attched via a push/chrome type clip. And the kick panels are screwed in with a
nice finish washer.
The cargo door panels are original, they were done by EZ-Camper I believe.
They have some type of fake wood/trying to look like some real wood
paneling...I am planning on replacing with a birch plywood, and putting some
type of water repellent on them, as the originals have some water damage on
them.
***********
Also, what is your front seat upholstery and is it original?
***********
The front seat upholstery is salt and pepper, with grey sides...I am pretty
sure it is original. They are pretty shredded. I have been waiting for samples
from different vendors, trying to find the most original looking. I am not
super hyper about it being the exact original, I just really like the look of
the original. I feel like it could kind of go with any paint color, incase I
decide to change the paint color when I repaint my bus.
***********
Was yours a panel pre-conversion? Mine was, so I have the single pane
windows that hinge out from the top. I'm looking for a good set of those.
***********
I am not sure what a panel pre-conversion is, but I do have the windows that
hinge at the top.single pane, manufactured by HEHR. I can't remember the model
number. My windows are in pretty good shape, but Hehr no longer manufactures
the seals for them. Actually they told me that they manufacture one of the
seals for them still. And they sent me some drawings of it. It doesn't look to
much like the seals that are on there, but I haven't had the time to look at
it too closely. I think I should be able to get a seal at a gasket company but
have not looked yet. If you have any luck with seals for these windows please
please please let me know.

Please email me around the beginning of june about interior photos if you are
still interested
***********
Good luck with your work!
***********
to you to...if you have any pics of your project up let me know.
