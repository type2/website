&gt;Wonder what this mean for club stuff though, like the SVT booth there was 
&gt;last year.

I will happily pay the money to park in show and set up the banner in front 
of my camper along with a table of club info.  I know the GGC folk pretty 
well (since I volunteer to help set up every year) and so *might* be able 
to swing a little space for the club booth.

Of course, I have no idea what this means if the whole SV2s crew comes up 
from SoCal.  They've a much bigger banner than I have. ;)
