Now I've been holding back for awhile here but I feel I need to point this out,
and I think John Howard will agree with me here (I have to drag someone else
into this with me)   8-)

We all know how Thom doesn't like to drive his Bus(es) out of Nor Cal right??
And he has been pressured on this list to go to the Cla$$ic weekend.

Well now that Bob Hole has his hands in the pot with the Cla$$ic I get the
feeling Thom may have fabricated this (w)Hole story as a way to get out of going
to the Cla$$ic. He was running out of reasons not too, Bus(es) are running fine,
VWHoward offered up gas money, etc. He really had no choice but too show. Now
suddenly been &quot;banned&quot; and he can't go. Did anyone else notice that he wasn't
all that upset by this??

Something's fishy here folks, I think we've all been
had..........................8-)

This is Friday right??
Good. For those not sure the above is NOT to be taken seriously. I'd hate to
have &quot;the list&quot; come down on me.

Greg
