 Well slowly but surely I'm getting the DC road-worthy.  I've got the turn
 signals and headlights working, only funny thing is they also work when the
 ignition is in the off position.  Is this right?  If not, what could be
 wrong?  I rewired everything as per the wiring diagram, or at least I
 thought I did. 
  
 Let there be light!!!!!!

yes, the headlight should work with the ignition off. 

 see that the ig switch turns on the 15 circuit, and that powers fuse second 
from right. 
 But the headlights get power from the farthest right fuse- which gets power 
directly from battery and does not rely on going through the ig switch. 

 in fact, the ignition switch gets power from the headlight switch!

 some years the turn sigs only work with key on, some years they work all the 
time.
