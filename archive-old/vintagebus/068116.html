Subject: Re: [VB] Front end Q's (part deux)

the spindles has a bushing pressed into it.
in the bushing fits the needle bearing
in the needle bearing fits the link pin

the link, needle bearing, and bushing are a 'unit' sort of like dont mix and 
match case halves.  

so mashing the old link out wouldn't hurt the spindle.

I've re used good links/bearing/bushing  by taking them off spindles and 
putting them on the spindle of use.   saves money.   (okay I'm cheap, but the 
steering is better), but still.  you can get the old bushings out with a 
drift (or socket) and a plastic mallet.

reusing old caps needs a persuasion too.   they have to fit just right, so 
I've un- tweaked the tweaked spots.

 I ended up leaving one of the link pins in my spindle because I couldn't 
drive it out and didn't want to totally destroy the spindle in the process. 
 Boy am i glad that's done. I now have new spindles, tie rod ends, link pins, 
and  drag link. It was a pretty painless job actually, but very dirty. The 
only complaint I have is that the caps that came with the new link pins 
didn't come close to fitting with out a persuasion.
