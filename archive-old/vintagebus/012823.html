hey all,
i got a small question... well two! i drove my bus around all weekend (for
the first time this summer) and noticed two small things.

1-there is a very small amount of oil that is dripping from the top of the
oil filler bowl, above where the tube meets the bowl at the top. (i don't
have an oil bath i have a top mounted paper element, and the vent hose goes
down through the tin by the dipstick.

2-after the thing warms up, it runs great, but then after about 20 maybe 25
mins of driving when i stop at a light or something it seems like it is
gonna die, the gen light comes on really dim but then i give it a little gas
so i don't stall it.

thanks in advance for any thoughts!!
