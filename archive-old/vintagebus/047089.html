probably apples and oranges but my wife's 82 Volvo was popping out of fourth 
and second and the mechanics diagnosis was motor mounts.  They had been 
destroyed by an oil leak (several actually) and once replaced the darn thing 
shifted like a dream.  Only now the Universal joints need replacing.  I know 
it's a volvo but if things are moving that shouldn't be moving you may save 
yourself some bucks by keeping em still.

Just a thought,
