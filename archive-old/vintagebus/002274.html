 Had my daughter buy me $20 worth of Big Game tickets and I got 2 winners.
One is 1 number plus big ball and the other is 3 numbers plus big ball
 missed 325 mill by 2 numbers). She is confused on payoff. Can any back east
listies let me know what it is for these 2 tickets. If enough will buy a new
used bus ( content). Thanks,

John Howard
