Hello all,

First off, thanks for the responses to my rubber seals profile request.
The profiles in the WCM catalog have been faxed off to my FLARG(friendly
local automotive rubber guy) and he assures me that he's got a match for
pretty much all of it - we'll see.

As to trading parts from South Africa - I am keen as mustard on the idea
and will post any parts that I find and can't use myself to the list.

Now the questions

I need to get a more complete shop manual for my 61 doublecab. I have
read about the Bentley manual and that sounds like the one for me.
Problem is that I can only find it for post '63 buses. Is there an
edition for the earlier buses and if so where is the cheapest place to
get it from?

Next question: if there isn't a Bentley for the earlier buses can anyone
recomend a good alternative other than the Idiot's Guide? I found the
Idiot's book useful but not nearly specific bus enough. 

hope you can help

Michael
