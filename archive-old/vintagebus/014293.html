Subject: [VB] Redux Box gaskets needed for 1960 bus
Message-ID: &lt;19991215090704.6511.qmail_at_web904.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Hi, I need a set of earlier small nut reduction box
gaskets for a 1960 westy.  I have seen them available
thru suppliers but most shipping charges are like a
7.95 minimum!...a lot for a set of $1.95 gaskets.

Anyone have any extras on hand to sell or know of a
place who won't charge me outrageous shipping on two
gaskets?

Thanks
