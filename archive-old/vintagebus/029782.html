&gt; The seat does have the westy serial number plate on it; can I decode it?

No need.  The two digit date will be on it.  Just look closely.  It will
have a serial # too.

&gt;
&gt; Otherwise I can only guess it is from a SO-42.   Is there a difference
&gt; in size for the different year z-beds throughout the years that they
&gt; used that yellow naugahide stuff; can I use a early bay window bus
&gt; closet.

The later non-split z-beds have metal &quot;S&quot; brackets that mount it to the rear
shelf in addition to the floor.  They stick out the back and are the easiest
way to tell the difference.  For pure functionality and strength these beds
are superior.  To use them though, you'll have to drill and bolt the
brackets to the rear shelf.  In addition, you'll have to trim to fit.  You
can use the closet, but you'll have to trim it too.   Out there somewhere,
there used to be a web site that showed how to convert the whole kit.
Doesn't look perfect, but works fine.  Not sure where it is.  Anyone??

S

&gt; Thanks for the picture sites , I am starting to get a better
&gt; idea what it is going to take if I make it.
