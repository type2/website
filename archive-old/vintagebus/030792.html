Hi Adrian,

I was having the same problems with my turnsignals, the right one wouldn't
work.  I checked all of the wiring and all of the connections, ran ground wires
for the tail light assemblies, and took the turn signal assembly apart and blew
air through it.  Nothing helped.  Finally my buddy pulled out his can of carb
cleaner, sprayed a whole bunch of junk out of there, let it dry, sprayed some
liquid wrench in there followed by compressed air, and that was a year ago and
everything has worked ever since.  Don't know if helps, but I thought I would
share.

&gt; I was wondering if there is an alternative turn signal switch/assembly

&gt;
&gt; I thought I fixed mine my resoldering the contacts, but that fix was short
&gt; lived and the left turn signal never worked anyway.  Astrogeek reports the
&gt; same problem, that these old units are just too old and fragile to hang on
&gt; anymore.
&gt;
&gt; There used to be repo ones for a million dollars, but that price is a little
&gt; prohibitive for me :)  They were about $225 if I remember right, and now no
&gt; longer available...  I guess no one else thought it was a deal either!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway I was wondering what lovely part NAPA (insert your favorite parts
&gt; store here) may have to replace this unit?  I think it would be an easy fit
&gt; for an aftermarket universal switch and all the wires probably hook up
&gt; easy...  Except the brake light switch that runs through there, I have no
&gt; idea if that poses an issue?
&gt;
&gt; This may be a job for our resident expert of electricals... Matt Roberds!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
