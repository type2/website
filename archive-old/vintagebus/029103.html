&gt;&gt;I was wondering today - For those special Kombis that were ordered with
&gt;&gt;2-tone paint (not standards), did they still come with black seat 
&gt;&gt;upholstery?

&gt;what is a 2-tone paint. ive heard of some paints where the color changes
each time the angle of viewing changes. but i dont know if that is 2-tone...
&gt;
I just meant normal a normal VW Bus 2-tone paint job, i.e. white over blue
or green over green, etc., like a normal Microbus or Deluxe Microbus would
have.

You could optionally order 2-tone paint on your Kombi instead of solid Dove
Blue or Sealing Wax Red or whatever.  Someone is selling a 2-tone '59 Kombi
with a normal '59 Standard paint scheme but all the seats have been replaced
so I was wondering if they should be black or grey or ?
