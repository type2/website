&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever heard of replacing the gears in the reduction boxes with 
gears of equal size (i.e. 1:1 ratio)? This would effectively eliminate the 
reduction boxes. It's been years since I've had mine apart, so I don't 
exactly remember what they look like on the inside - perhaps it wouldn't be 
possible.
  &gt;&gt;

I've heard of the concept, but don't know if anyone has actually made the 
parts.  I believe there was a good reason why it would be a PITA to do, but I 
forget what that reason was.
