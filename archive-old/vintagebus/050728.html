Subject: Re: [T2] Listee stickers

Andrew,
there was talk of this on the vintagebus list and the problems that arose in previous ventures.

I am proposing this....Since a good bit of our oversea listees are in Austrailia.  We can wait for a total number of stickers requested from your neck of the woods and the I can mail all of them to you or another listee for distribution.  I think this would be much easier than individually mailing out single stickers.

Any comments...suggestions are welcome...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I'm in Australia &amp; I'd like 1 or 3 of the stickers.
&gt; I'm not sure how much the return mail is going to be
&gt; though.
&gt; Should I send the extra money needed for postage in
&gt; the money-order/bank-cheque for the stickers or is
&gt; there another way to go about it?
&gt; By the way, the stickers are the vintage bus ones
&gt; aren't they.......i.e. the one on thesamba_dot_com?
&gt; Let me know what you'd like me to do.
&gt; It may be a good idea to let people on the list know
&gt; what to do if they are overseas &amp; would like some
&gt; stickers because I know of quite a few non-U.S. list
&gt; members in the same boat as myself in terms of the
&gt; mail situation.
&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; &gt; Thanks to everyone that got a sticker at OCTO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We had a great time...good to meet new faces and see
&gt; &gt; familiar ones.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For all of you that wanted a sticker and need them
&gt; &gt; mailed to you then here is what to do.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm selling them for 4 bucks a piece.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please send payment and a SASE and I will mail them
&gt; &gt; out ASAP.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; P-mail me for address...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bay owners:  This is only for the split bus stickers
&gt; &gt; at the moment..I will hopefully finalize the bay
&gt; &gt; stickers this week and send an update to the type2
&gt; &gt; list.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Later,
