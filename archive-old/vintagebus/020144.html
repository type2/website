you guys may remember my attempt at rebuilding parts of my ez-camper
interior...i have finally been able to get back to it now that my bus has a
new engine. spent all night last night trying to salvage the trim that goes
around each door...over an hour per door. a lot of fun. by the time i got to
the last one i finally came up with a system...(if anyone ever tries this
themself and wants some tips let me know)

I should have all the pieces together by tomorrow night(taking tomorrow off
work). Hopefuly installing by friday. If everything fits, i'll try ot finish
my drawings this weekend and they will be posted to www.sv2s_dot_com,  maybe some
photos too.

one thing i am kind of stuck on is trying to find an affordable flooring
material. I have some baltic birch with sound proofing on the bottom, I was
planning on linoleum on top(like last summer) Unfortunately i can't seem to
find a piece of linoleum that isn't trying to look like tile. Hey its
linoleum...who we trying to kid here. I got lucky last summer and found a
scrap at the Depot, but they depot down here in texas doesn't have
anything...so my option are to wait until i find the right stuff, put the
cabinets in, and just put a piece of masonite on top until i get the right
stuff, or put the stuff that looks like tile in.

i don't mind waiting, it is just that to install the stuff you need to take
every cabinet out.

anyway...just thought i would keep those interested updated....I will be
looking for someone to unload the different pieces to. some are ok, some are
rather scrapppy, and i have stripped most of the hardware off...doesn't sound
too good, but if you want it...
