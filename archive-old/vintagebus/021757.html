21 conversion, restoration and fabrication is my trade for 20+. The roof is an
easy graft if you take the time to drill spotwelds correctly. But then came
the relization that any 21 exists in its own place waiting for a aresto and
the 13, as clara points out does not have a big hole waiting for water to
enter.  So back to the secret decoder ring, where do I find the key to unlock
M-codes?

the original Parts Lists have them, NEATO page  has them, the spec book put
out by neato/ssvc/bulli kartei has them, or you could post them to the list
and I could look them up in my  books, although some are unlisted and
mysteries still.....

  Another area of question is deluxes have heat front and rear, and it appears
that po has capped of one tube. The center forward tube has  a pvc tube
replacement. The biggie here is right rear floor has a gaping hole where i
would assume the rear heat vent to be. Why would someone cut this out? does it
take floor space.? Bus came with no rear seats but i have in short time found
correct rear seat w/ bars white/acqua and the elusive middle seat 2/3
white/acqua for the happily paid amount of 50 bucks :&gt;) Get this,  seats were
50 miles apart and surely not from the same bus. As the po had black seats
upfront, they sprayed the seat back vinyl black, a little lacquer thinner,
voila, ACQUA!

I have seen the rear tube cut out sometimes, and it may have been that some
one built something in there and felt the heat tube was in the way, and wanted
to send it up front (erck)   Congrats on the seats!!!!!
.  .. . .  .. .  .. . 
Any body have the rear heat vent assembly? Another look for part,
i assume there are bows for the headliner on the 13, any bows or at the min. a
length and bend measurement.
