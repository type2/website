Subject: Re: [VB] Cruise control in a splittie! (long)

&gt;Well gang,  I'm almost done fitting a cruise control unit to my 64 =
&gt;delux!

Cool!

&gt;Anyway, the only glitch I've run into now, is the spring on the carb is
&gt;too stiff.

Figure out a way to give it a longer lever arm to pull on.  All you
really need is a piece of steel with a flatted hole in one end to go
over the throttle shaft, or even weld a piece onto the throttle arm
you have now.  This way you can use the original return spring but
let the cruise module use less force to move the throttle.

&gt;The cruise module can only pull so much (I think it used manifold vacuum),
&gt;so if I hit an uphill grade, the unit will kick off, as soon as it can't
&gt;pull the throttle anymore.

As the throttle opens to make it up the hill, manifold vacuum drops
anyway.  Many cars with factory cruise control use a small vacuum
reserve tank between the manifold and the cruise unit - adding a
check valve between the manifold and the reserve tank will help even
more.  You can make a tank out of any small cylinder, like an old
fire extinguisher or propane bottle - it only has to be proof against
about 30 PSI.  Or, get the reserve tank from an older American car
at a junk yard - Fords used tanks that looked exactly like big soup
cans, while GMs had round plastic balls with two vacuum fittings.  
Look on early-80s and older models; later models have electronic
cruise controls that are run by stepper motors that do not require
vacuum.
