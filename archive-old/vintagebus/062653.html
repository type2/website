Subject: Allstate Single Wheel Trailer Clamps?

Score!  I was doing some computer work for an older couple (was paid in 
baked goods) and on my way out I noticed a single wheel trailer.  Went back 
to the house and asked how if it was for sale and how much....  Was told if 
I wanted it I could have it.  I haven't brought it home yet, it was being 
used to hold firewood and they wanted to empty it.  I am pretty sure its an 
allstate, by the look of it, has cutouts for slats.  I have no way of 
attaching it to the bumper on my bus.  Went to singlewheel site and saw lots 
of pics of the hardware.  Anyone know of something that would work or anyone 
have an extra set?

Was thinking this Karma had something to it till I got in my car, turned on 
the air and hit the passenger side window button. Krunch!  window came off 
the rail, darn.
