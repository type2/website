Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ..speaking of Pucks

I know I know, but its like that bus ad that shows a
deluxe with ten or so things are wrong with it,
including the factory roof rack. VW stated that you
would never need one, only thing on the roof would be
the rack cause of all the interior room. I can see a
puck behind a deluxe, truck, or kombi.

&gt; Well, with a split or early bay I would figure it
&gt; involves the lack of
&gt; sleeping area for the passengers...Sure, my bus
&gt; sleeps two, even three if
&gt; they're close, across the full width bed...but it
&gt; comfortably rides three
&gt; to four in the back, 2 or three up front.  A split
&gt; without the so44 kit
&gt; has a narrower bed...two is more reasonable.  An
&gt; early bad adds just a
&gt; single uncomfortable (i've slept in it for a week, i
&gt; know!) cot up top..

&gt; soo, if you've got kids (or just friends along for
&gt; the ride..) where do
&gt; you put them?  Tent?  Annoying, perhaps wet and cold
&gt; as well.
