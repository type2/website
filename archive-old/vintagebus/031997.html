Sorry about that last post, hit the wrong button. Anyway, since my bus did 
not have either of the rear seats, I started looking online for camper 
interior. I asked a lot of people selling Westies if they would sell the 
interior out of them since I always read about others selling Westies that 
had already parted out the interior, or was selling a bus that had been 
converted. Most people wanted a lot of money or would not part out, but one 
guy in Ventura, was willing to (gut it). The only problem is that it is a 
'72. I know that it will need a little modifying, but I know that I can do 
it. I am pretty good with wood and have access to a lot of tools because I 
work for a company that makes custom crates (wooden). 
    After emailing the guy, he responded back in about 15 minutes and said to 
call him. I did and he said if I went that same day, he would sell the 
closet, seat that folds into a bed, the cushion behind the seat, the table, 
and the child's cot with the brackets for $150. I had to take it!!! I know 
that it will not be at all correct, but I know I will use it and love it. I 
wanted to take my mom's van, because the rear seats all come out, leaving a 
lot of room, but her friend (borrowed) it to move, and hasn't brought it back 
in 2 weeks!!! So, being a last minute trip, I decided to go in my '87 S10 
Bl*zer. I did not want to take it, because I bent an A-arm, and it is bad for 
the balljoint and the tire, but I had to. I wanted to take some friends, but 
had to take my sister because no one else would go last minute. We got there 
in about 1hr. 15 min. As we got to his street (100 miles away) My engine 
light came on, less than 10 seconds later the engine died, and white smoke 
started coming from under the hood. I popped the hood, and my engine was on 
fire. A + wire came loose and rubbed on a pulley, grounding out the entire 
motor. It was on fire in 3 places. I even burned my arm and hand putting it 
out. Luckily I was a few houses down from the guy's house, and like all VW 
lover's, he was extremely nice! He gave me water because I was dyeing, and 
helped me get all the camper gear from his bus to my truck. He even called 
around to get me the best price on a tow. AAA wanted $45 hook up, and $7 a 
mile for 100 miles. He found a place that said they would do it for $2 a 
mile. After waiting for me to get picked up, he went on his way, because he 
had to get to DMV before they closed, and almost didn't make it so I wouldn't 
be stranded. The tow place still ripped me off though because they knew I was 
desperate, and the 100 miles at $2 a mile somehow added to $359. I was in 
really bad shape though, and had to get home for a dinner I had to go to join 
a Fraternity. So now, my perfect looking '87 Ch*vy is sitting in the driveway 
right next to the '58 VW that will take less work to get running.  
    I can't wait to drive it, because I want all the parts I need bought 
first. I guess that is what I get for trying to save money spending $150 on 
the interior, when it could have gone toward an ignition and rear deck lid. 
    The bus content is that I am really afraid to drive my bus now. Because 
it has caused me all this trouble, and left me stranded on the side of the 
road twice now, and I haven't even started her up once!!! ;-) The good that 
came out of it all is that I made a new friend, and got the interior I 
wanted, that will be my first little project, to get it to fit right. Also it 
worked out great, because as I mentioned in my last letter, my '58 came with 
a sink and the little seat. I am also excited about the cot, I heard that 
they re worth some money by themselves. And by the way, now I have an extra 
rear seat out of some kind of camper. It is the back rest and the bench part. 
It is tan, the bench is smooth vinyl, and the backrest is perforated vinyl, 
same color. If anybody wants these pieces, I will hopefully take them to 
Kelley Park (if I can take the van) and probably to Pomona on the 16th. You 
can trade them for anything you have for a '58 in Pomona, or for a good story 
and company at Kelley Park. I really want to go there. I am new to the scene 
and just want to meet some of you guys.
