Clara asked:
When was the 'zero' invented? I though it was earlier
than that, but the europeans hadn't adopted it till
after it was invented.  it was arabic. we use arabic
numbers.

Ellis sez:
Zero? Don't worry about it. It's nothing, nothing at
all.

Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas to all.
Hope your Kwanza was a &quot;right on.&quot;
