&gt; i know, this is as old a question as they come, if i'm lookin at a binz
how can i tell?  Dont worry i didnt find it.(probably)lol
&gt;
There's good pics of the one John Howard aka VW Howard (listee) used to own
at:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/photosdoublecabs.htm

Note the following:
o Large side windows for the rear seating section
o Side gates have a small front pressed section as they were cut from Single
Cab gates
o Pressed bumpers, although I've seen people with them on '59s
o Suicide 3rd door, although it wasn't suicide for the limited '59 Binzs:

o Funky fresh rear seat
o Weird body seam on driver's side indicating Single Cab origins
o '58 &quot;flat&quot; decklid, if it's not missing

I've heard VWHoward say he had the only White Binz known to exist.  I guess
it's possible that VW Classic '59 above is the only SWR red known?

Note Double Cabs owned by a few other listees on that page, too.
