I assue you are using repros, which cause problems being thicker than the 
original 2mm thickness.  SO sand down the non seen side of the panel.

does anyone have any tricks for installing the hardboard panels in the front
cab section of the bus?

i have been having a hell of a time getting them to fir into all the &quot;grooves&quot;
at once (the one that runs along the side of the overhead vent box) and then
above the trim panel on the outside.

i am trying to do it on the drivers side if it makes any diff.

i can get one side to fit in but when it comes to the other side, major
effort.

any suggestions??
