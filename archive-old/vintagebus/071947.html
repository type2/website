&lt;&lt; OK everything looks ok.  I hop inside and turn the ignition, fires up, but 
 the starter sticks and smoke begins coming out of the dash pod.  So I try it 
 again thinking it may have came loose.  Nope more smoke.  &gt;&gt;

 I saw this happen once, and the bus needed a new ignition switch.  it was 
crossing inside the switch where it shouldn't have.

a good ignition switch fixed the problem.

You could alwways pull the wires off the switch and hot wire the bus.   It 
that gives no smoke, i'd think it was the switch
