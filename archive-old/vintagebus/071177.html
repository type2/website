Subject: Steam Clean an Engine?

Somebody mentioned this in a forum, and I was wondering if any of you had
ever heard of it being performed.  If you slowly drop water down your carb
while your engine is running, it will slowly &quot;steam clean&quot; your pistons,
cylinders, heads, and exhaust.  Has anybody on the list done this before?
Did it work?  What was the procedure?
