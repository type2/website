Subject: garage venting?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Somebody's got to know this.

I live in Los Angeles, about 5 miles form the ocean
(never gets above 100 never below 50). We have a
detached garage, 18' square, stucco walls, sloping
tab-shingle roof, and a wooden double width door.
There's no water heater in there, just electricity. I
just drywalled the walls (no insulation or anything
behind the drywall) and put some planks in the rafters
for storage. I keep my beloved DARTHVW in there, and I
was wondering if anyone knows if there should be a
need for venting (either a couple of those whirlybird
thingies on the roof, or just some louvered screen
panels along the lower sections of the walls). 

I've heard that buildings can trap moisture, and with
the bus in there and metal parts in the rafters, the
less moisture the better. Right? Or would vents let
moisture in?


Thoughts? experiences?

Thanks,
Jason
