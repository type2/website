Subject: Re: [VB] paint formula needed L289

Its called blue white, and I got the colour mixed for my 65 westy (blue white 
over velvet green original colours).  Unfortunately the PPG mix was too minty 
green, and I went back and they so kindly remixed it .  They really 
understood how people painting their old cars want the colour just right.   
So there are 5 coats of white on that bus.  (The PPG paint still looks great 
over 4 years later.  It really is quality. Oddly I am going through a spurt 
of getting compliments on the bus from random people the last couple weeks. ) 
    That BW mix issue was not a unique problem to me, but in the mix code in 
their books.  I can tell who gets PPG on their bus by the blue-white being 
too green.  (Yes it actually is kinda green white)  They just need to tip 
some more white in.  My suggestion is to take a piece of OG painted stuff, 
like the over headsvent cover, in with you to the paint shop when it's mixed 
up, and make sure it matches.  Polish the OG paint up before hand to remove 
oxidation.   Oh, the PPG place should have the mix on file, have you asked 
them?  Filed by L code.

&lt;&lt; Hey folks,
 I'm having some trouble finding the mixing formula
 for L289 Pale Blue. This is the top color on a 65 Kombi.
 Does anyone know how I can obtain this info? I want to use 
 PPG paint if that makes any difference.
 Any help is much appreciated.
 TIA
 
 Larry
