&gt;The fun part will be taking my own front end there and installing it.

This is one thing I'm gonna work on when I get time. Since most of the time
you find the rear-end (transaxle) missing of the 2, I fashioned a &quot;rear-end
dolly&quot; out of scrap that bolts to the tranny mounts. Man has that thing
come in handy! I swear I could sell a few of those if I had time to make
'em! Think how many times you find a bus without the rear-end. OR how many
times you've got it out to work on it and suddenly need to move your bus.

You can see pictures of it here:

Anyone done anything like this for the front end? I've got a bus I need to
haul off that I just might end up using is as an excuse to make something
up.
