I am almost caught up with sleep &amp; work so here is a not-so-short report.

My friend Allen really wanted to take his '64 Standard down to Tampa this 
year (actually he wanted to take it last year, but you know how deadlines 
come &amp; go).  I had been helping him work on it on &amp; off for the last few 
weeks, and a week ago we realised he was really getting down to the wire 
on getting it finished.

There was no way he was going to get an engine done for it in time, so we 
pulled the 1600sp that I used to drive back from NM in the '54 Kombi this 
summer.  On Wednesday night I put it in his '64.  At that time, I was still 
doubtful that we would be taking the '64.  About 1/3 of the windows were 
still out, there was no interior in it, there were no bumpers on it, he had 
the speedometer in about a dozen pieces on his workbench, etc.

Thursday after work I wanted to go over &amp; help him some more, but I also 
had to finish editing Old Bus Review #62 to send it Priority Mail to be 
printed in Albuquerque before I left for Tampa.  I finally got done with it 
around 11:00pm and headed home to meet people that were coming to my place 
to caravan down Friday morning.

The first ones to get to my place were Neil Pickett (in his '66 Deluxe),
Mitch Davis (in his '63 Panel), John Wattlington (in his '70 Kombi), and 
Don &amp; Jay from Mannasas, VA (in Don's '67 Crewcab).  They got there between 
11:30 &amp; midnight because they had gotten a late start out of Asheville, NC.
Don had broken the clutch throwout bearing arm in his crewcab, so they had 
to drop his engine &amp; replace that.

The next to arrive was Billy Montiel (in his '65(?) sliding door Standard) 
from Memphis, TN.  After I went to bed Danny Morganelli &amp; his friend Mike 
got there in Mike's SO-42 Westy.

We got up about 7:00am and I called Allen to see how his progress went 
Thursday night.  He didn't get nearly as much done as he hoped and asked 
me to bring a speedometer with me.

John had frozen on the way down from NC and wanted to hook up the heat in 
his 70 Kombi before we left.  He thought since Atlanta was south of NC 
that it would be warmer.  It was about 34 degrees with a wind chill of 
about 16 degrees.  Don told John that his fanbelt looked loose, so John 
went ahead and replaced the belt (literary types would call this last 
sentence fore-shadowing, you'll see later in the story...).  We finally 
headed over to Allen's house at about 9:00 am.

When we got there all the guy's jaws sort of dropped when they saw what 
was left to do on Allen's '64.  I told them to all go ahead &amp; go eat 
breakfast while Allen &amp; I worked on the '64.  I hooked up the fuel lines, 
heater hoses &amp; cables &amp; coil while Allen put in the speedometer that I 
had brought.

By the time they got back I was bolting on the rear apron.  Don's comment 
was, &quot;Dave, it ain't gonna happen.  There is just too much left to do&quot;.

Billy needed to run to Radio Shack to get a few parts for his cb radio, so 
that bought us another hour of time.  Don put in the last pop-out window 
while I finished hooking up all the electrical and put the steering wheel 
on.  While we were doing this, Neil &amp; Mitch were pulling all the seats out 
of Allen's '55 where they had been stored.  They put them in while I put in 
the front floor mat.

Before Billy got back we were able to get the bumpers on and pull it out of 
the garage into the driveway.  I told Allen we needed to get on the road 
and to go ahead and pack all the parts into the '64 and we would finish 
putting it together when we got to FL.

I went and filled the '64 up with gas at the gas station while he was 
gathering up the rest of the parts for it.  On the way to the gas station I 
experienced a near total brake failure and the engine would not idle.  When 
I got back to Allen's we bled the brakes, but lost pressure again when we 
got to the last front wheel.

We figured out Allen had not adjusted the brakes properly, so we re-adjusted 
them, bled them, and finally got good brakes.  I figured out the carb would 
not idle because the old ceramic choke element was broken and was letting the 
choke valve flop around wherever it wanted.  I decided we should just go for 
it and get on the road since no one had a spare 6v choke.

Since Allen had about 10 hours total in the last week and I was better at 
heel-toe driving with bad idle, I drove his '64 while he got some sleep.  
We had a nice caravan of seven buses.  I was glad that when I rebuilt the 
tranny in Allen's '64 earlier this summer that I replace the 4.37 r&amp;p with 
a 4.12.  It really did make a difference in engine rpms at cruising speed.

The drive was pretty uneventful from Atlanta to just north of Gainesville, 
FL.  John's bus was making a hell of a noise, so we pulled over to check it 
out.  His generator shaft bearing became toast from adjusting his fanbelt 
too tight.  I called friends of mine, Ray &amp; Lea Hale, in Gainesville to see 
if they had a spare 12v generator.  They had a spare 6v, but said we could 
crash there for the night &amp; go to the FLAPS in the morning to get one.

We drove the rest of the way to Gainesville slowly with John's engine lid 
open so I could see if his fanbelt got tossed.  Every now &amp; then I would 
see a spark as bits of generator bearing came screaming out.

We got to the Hale's house and I took John's generator and fan out.  Don 
did not believe I would be able to do it in the bus engine compartment 
without dropping the engine down.  The other guys decided they wanted to go 
on to Tampa so Allen &amp; I stayed there with John and the rest of them went 
on.

The next morning we got the rebuilt generator, I put it in John's bus and 
we hit the road.  We were able to make better time the rest of the way 
down since Neil wasn't riding with us.  We cruised along at 65mph.  Before 
we were only able to go between 55-60mph because Neil's '66 still has an 
operable govenor on it.

We pulled into Reeve's VW about 1:00pm and I think Mike Brown said there 
were about 60 buses there.  Being late, all the deals in the swap meet were 
already gone.  The only thing I bought was a NOS 40hp muffler installation 
kit that has the rubber mount between the rear bumper bracket and the 
muffler damper pipe, and I could have bought that at my house, because I 
bought it from John.  I did sell 4 SSVC/NEATO Split Screen Spec Guides and 
sign up two people for NEATO.  One Spec Guide &quot;walked away&quot; from my table 
while I was walking around.  If you know anyone who forgot to pay for it, 
please tell them to send me $17 if they are a NEATO member, or $20 if they 
are not.

My favorite buses were a '58 Dove Blue Panel with the rear hatch w/o the 
window, a '59 Dove Blue Single Cab complete with tilt, a '62 Ruby Red 
Single Cab with a nicely detailed 40hp, and a '66 RHD High Roof sliding 
door Panel.  This was the one advertised in the SSVC newsletter and 
Volksworld last year.

Peach State Transporters did pretty well in the Bulli Brigade awards with 
Allen Becker taking the Passenger Bus class with his '64 Standard and 
Chris Sanor &amp; Beth Wallace taking the Camper class with their '67 Westy.

Hats off to Mike Brown for hosting the Bulli Brigade again this year.  Mike, 
I promise to bring the '54 Kombi down next year.  I should have it done by 
then.  I have gone every year and have always had a good time.

After the show we had a caravan to the motel.  While we were there, I did 
see Michelle Putnam's '65 Deluxe.  I had a brain f_at_rt &amp; did not realise it 
was hers, or I would have tried to talk to her.  She mentioned the other day 
that she thought it was repainted the wrong colors.  Actually, those are the 
correct colors for 1965.  The Sea Blue bottom was pretty close, but the Blue 
White top was about two shades off (little too green).  In 1966 the colors 
went from Sea Blue/Blue White to Sea Blue/Cumulus White.

From the motel a group from PST went to Port Richey to eat seafood, then to 
Quail Run to camp for the night.

We got up early and went to the Bug Jam.  They were much more organized this 
year and we got into the show without much waiting.  Allen entered his '64 
in the &quot;Under Construction&quot; class.  I was really disappointed in the vendor 
turnout this year.  There were less than half the number of vendors as there 
have been in previous years.  I think the change in price structure for 
vendors had a lot to do with it.  I bought a few little things for myself 
and a set of tent poles because I knew someone in PST needed a set.

Saw a lot of list members there at the Bug Jam that I had missed at the 
Bulli Brigade due to our late arrival.  We stayed until they handed out 
awards and Allen took 1st place in &quot;Under Construction&quot; for his '64 Standard.

I felt really good that Allen was rewarded for all the work he did on the 
'64.  We could have just left Friday morning and gone in one of my buses, but 
he really wanted to go in the '64 and I was not about to take that away from 
him.

We left at dark &amp; got back to Atlanta about 3:30am.  I had to drive back too 
because Allen can't drive at night due to a degenerating retina in one of 
his eyes.  It was hard to get up &amp; go to work the next day, but we had a 
really great weekend.

I hope this inspires some of you to get out there &amp; drive the hell out of 
your buses.  Allen's 1964 had not been driven for 16 years...  at all!  I 
drove it 1 mile to get gas, we came back and adjusted the brakes, then we 
drove it 450 miles to Tampa.  The only problems we had was an intermittent 
idling problem due to a bad choke and a sticking starter solenoid.  We had 
to either tap the solenoid or push start it a few times and that was it.

Buses are made to be driven!

Dave
