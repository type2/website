Boyd,

Try Outwater Plastics.  They are on the web.  1(888) OUTWATER 1(800)
631-8375  HTTP://WWW.OUTWATER.COM  .  I've not ordered anything from them.
Maybe someone on the list can speak for quality and service.

For the plastic surround, Ronnie of list and fire fame sold me one.  Check
with him to see if he has any that aren't melted yet.  He also told me that
West Coast Metric has them also.  This is the gray poptop surround that goes
inside the bus.  Good luck.

Steve

&gt; Hello out there,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of a source for new plastic trim to go around the cabinet
&gt; doors on a 67 westy?  I can find the type that surrounds the tables and
&gt; trims the spice rack but I can't locate any of the type that surround the
&gt; closet door.  Also does anyone know of a source for the interior plastic
&gt; trim that goes around the bottom of the poptop canvas?  Any help on this
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
