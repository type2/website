Subject: Re: [VB] what ever happened to the boat bus

hi i like the boat , reminds me of a boat I have had for 25 years (only 
similar.

I am a boater that has built restored, maintained etc boats.
I am a novice.
A standard method to make an exact copy of a boat- make a mold and plug.

Theoretically simple. Flip boat over (square it up in to shape)
2 apply release agent
3 apply polyester resin and fiberglass to make an exact copy of the 
shape
4 separate.
now you have an exact copy of (the hole the boat makes in the water)-
you see where I am going,
then you use this plug as your mold. then lay up glass and resin to 
make a copy of the hull
THOUSANDS OF BOATS ARE AND WERE MADE THIS WAY. people would copy wooden 
boats to be made in fiberglass.

Personally I have been thinking about building a small dingy for a one 
man shop
It is not a skilled labor job . Once the first one is made you are set 
up to do an indefinite amount.
Your demand will be hard to calculate-there is the initial investment 
probably at least a few to several boats worth.  The more you make and 
sell the less the percentage
your initial cost is in the final product.
Then once you have the bottom you copy the &quot;top&quot;
Other items to consider is : any patents? or ownership or design. maybe 
you could find and buy the original molds, coast guard certification, 
will the boat only fit a small range of years or from 1950 to current 
or even just market them as boats for anyone, or any car topper.
A lot to check out but you might find a good business
Of course with all this fiberglass around, go crazy, make travel 
trailers (I am thinking teardrop type), or pop up to go behind a bus or 
any vehicle. EVER THINK OF MAKING A RUST FREE FOREVER BUS- My belief is 
it could be done with engineering input, composite material 
(fiberglass) and people that want them. That Is the big question? What 
would it be worth to people to have a replica bus. I dont think there 
is much of a demand yet.
My gut feeling is no one will make an exact duplicate of the boat that 
fits the odd contours or the bus or trailer top. But a just the right 
size boat that might appeal to many is possible.
Remember after the initial investment-the boats are fast, easy and 
inexpensive to build. I company named Bayliner started out with very 
humble beginnings, actually most boat companies
did.

LASTLY IF I UNDERSTAND SOMEONE CLAIMED TO BUY A NEW BOAT 15 YEARS AGO? 
THOSE MOLDS ARE PROBABLY STILL AROUND-DIG FOR IN FO. MOLDS ARE A REAL 
KEY.
