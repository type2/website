Hi Tim,
We rebuild and do cosmetic work on pre-1972 bus clocks for $75.00 which 
includes return shipping in the USA.  As for other gauges an oil pressure and 
temp are required as far as we are concerned.  Placement of these below the 
dash works if placed to the right (LHD) of the speedo pod so as to allow the 
passenger to view them also, but we have been thinking of removing the ash 
tray and using that hole as a mounting point for accessory gauges on top of 
the dash.  As for Digital gauges these are not a good idea except maybe for a 
clock.  With sudden changes in temp or oil pressure the digital becomes a 
blur of numbers of which 5, 6, and 8 are hard to differentiate at a glance.  
Several analog gauges (hand type) can be read all at once at a glance by only 
needle position, once one has gotten used to them, instead of having to read 
one digital gauge at a time.
