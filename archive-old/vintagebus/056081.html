Subject: Re: [VB] 1600 SP valve Q

Your studs on #2 side could be pulling.

&gt; 1600 SP now with ~9000 miles.
&gt; Before Everybus I found a tight #2 exhaust. Like no or close to no
&gt; clearance tight. Its around 2500 miles since and I adjusted the valves
&gt; this morn. Several valves needed a bit of adjustment but #2 was tight
&gt; again. I suppose Ill just have to keep an eye on it.
&gt; Im kind of wondering what most likely to be happening.
&gt; Any wear in the cam, lifter, rod or rocker should cause the valve to
&gt; become looser, right? So are the only possiblities the valve seat pounding
&gt; in or the valve itself stretching? Whatever it is I estimate that its
&gt; moved around 10-12 thousandths in the last say... 4500 miles.
&gt; Any comments appreciated.
