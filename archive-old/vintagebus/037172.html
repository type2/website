  Also on temps run a VDO gauge and see what you are running before spending
  the time on an external cooler.  Here are the general Porsche numbers (356=
,
  914, and 911):
  176-210 running cool
  220 Normal=20
  230 Warm
  240 Hot
  250 Too Hot
   &gt;&gt;

 &gt;&gt;Then Clara writ:

 upright ACVW- I though oil degrades about 225-230.  In fact I've seen a=20
 difference in consistancy after it's run that hot.     I thought 176-210 wa=

 ideal, if it was below that after it had warmed up it would be too cool.

 &quot;This can happen at temperatures as low as 230=BA F and by 250=BA F many
 petroleum oils are suffering significant breakdown.&quot;
=20
 &quot;Oil temperatures of 230=BAF to 250=BAF are not at all uncommon in driver's
 education track conditions, particularly in early 911s with no front cooler=
s
 or the marginally effective &quot;trombone&quot; oil coolers. These temperatures are
 also fairly common in air-cooled engines in summer time stop and go traffic
 with the A/C on. Further, temperatures on the cylinder walls and in turbos
 are often over 450=B0F for short periods of time. &quot;
=20
 Clara, I totally agree that 220 is a little high for everyday normal use.
 On a road trip I would let it get to 230 before I pulled over or let off th=
e
 gas though.  My idea of a perfect normal temperature is 190 for any air
 cooler.  The 911 I have runs super cool right at 180 most of the time, on
 the track I got it to hit 225 once though which is still pretty cool.
  &gt;&gt;

wow, I dont think the condition here are atypical, they are normal  :). =20

anyway, Just because the engines can and do run hotter than ideal (over 210)=
=20
doesn't mean to change the concept of what ideal is.  The oils still degrade=
=20
at the same temp, whatever we want to say, and will lose lubricating=20
properties.  These are parameters I try to deal with.   Liek the Gene Berg=20
light blinks at what 225?  which is when they says the dangerous temp is . =20
If I'm running 100C, no prob, 105C, keep an eye on it, 110 C (230F), thats=20
the red line for oil degrade, thought it wouldn't instantly seize.  Anyhow,=20
that's how I read it.   Which is why I swapped to the type4coolerdog, which=20
made the same trip up to Seattle an oil temp of 85 C instead of 95C, in same=
=20
weather.  (it also blows more heat into the bus in cool weather)  Also when=20=
I=20
got off the freeway, the temp dropped quicker.   My max temp in the desert S=
W=20
 last year was 230, when going up hills with the air dry and in the 90s,   I=
=20
was worried about it being hot.   peaked the hills, then it dropped soon to=20
200 going down, evened at 210 on the level. Damp air cools better than dry=20
air.  It was dry there.  I guess since I dont see higher temps as much I am=20
not used to them, not used to the bus getting over 100C,  but the oil reacts=

the same.  I mean I can be acclimatised to the weather, and a hot sunny day=20
like yesterday I was too warm in a T shirt, but was told it hadn't even=20
gotten into the 60s, but oil doesn't acclimatise like that.

Ya, anyhow, I highly recommend that type4coolerdog, it does help.  I know=20
some people love external coolers, but you do need a thermostat X.  I've see=
n=20
hoses fallen off killing motors through lack of oil, motors not warming up=20
from lack of thermostat X meaning improper lubing, and even coolers run into=
=20
at parking lots, mush mush spill dripp.  Well, okay, I guess if it is always=
=20
above 70F and dry you could get away without the X, but it would still help=20
warm the motor up, like the thermostat flaps dealie does.   Ya, and having=20
all the tin and engine compartment seals helps too.
