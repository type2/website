Subject: Re: [VB] Water hammer?

Also, the term you are looking for is &quot;hydrostatic lock&quot;, not &quot;water
hammer&quot;.  Water hammer is the banging you get in water systems
(plumbing) when valves are closed suddenly.

&gt;
&gt; Can anyone please tell me how this
&gt; occurs?
&gt;
&gt; you answered your own question with your last
&gt; sentence: &quot;It was sitting outside, we
&gt;
&gt; did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze
&gt; filters.&quot; rain/water entered through the air filter and #1 intake
valve just
&gt; happened to be the open one at the time.

&gt; I just cleared out what I believe is called water hammer from my no.
1.
&gt; After a
&gt;
&gt; two day hiatus my engine wouldn't turn and looking at things before I
pull
&gt; the
&gt;
&gt; motor; some water drizzled out of my right valve cover and the moter
&gt; wouldn't
&gt;
&gt; turn past about 30-40 degrees BTDC so I pulled spark plug no.1 and the
&gt; motor
&gt;
&gt; turned to a gushing sound and there was water on the plug. I spun the
&gt; motor
&gt;
&gt; several times then replaced the plug and after some coaxing fired up
and
&gt; runs as
&gt;
&gt; before. Can anyone please tell me how this occurs? It was sitting
outside,
&gt; we
&gt;
&gt; did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze
&gt; filters.
