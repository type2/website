Thom,

    You've missed the obvious solution. . .  Take that NOS set of BD wheels
down to the local welder and have them suckers widened!!  Yeah, dish 'em out
about 10 &quot;phat, pimpin' inches&quot;. . .  Yeah baby, then mount some skinny
whitewall'd biasply tires that have no godly business on a rim wider than
4&quot;. . . I'm having visions of gold plating too. . . ;-)

(Disclaimer:  The previous post is a perfect example of the effects of too
much eggnogg :-) )

Not only that, but the BD wheels are narrower, so what you may have gained
in a thinner sidewall is lost, and then some, by the narrower wheel.

You'd be much better served by getting light truck tires.  I won't go into
that - there are others on here WAY more versed in tires for buses.
