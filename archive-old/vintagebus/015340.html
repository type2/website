It's too late for that - the bus is almost ready for paint, and then
re-assembly.  I gotta get all this stuff at once.  

Hey, I'll saveshipping charges by getting it all in one big phat batch...

The only thing more fun than buying rubber is the installation...

&gt; Thom....it is easier if you begin now.
&gt; Begin what you say?  Begin buying those pieces one or more at a time
&gt; now...storing them for later use.  It's never going to get cheaper...plus
&gt; when you die think of all the people that will flock to your estate sale
&gt; to buy NOS repro goodies!!!!!!  :)
&gt; later
