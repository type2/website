&gt;It would be kewl to know what kind of buses and their conditions that we
&gt;all on the list have, so if you feel so inclined post what you got.

Just one, a '64 Standard Microbus.  Turquoise and blue-white.  Bought
it from the 3rd owner in July 2000; she bought it from the second
owner in the San Francisco area in spring 1990.  Showing 56k miles
when I got it, which is supposed to be the mileage on the '68 Bug
1500 that's in it.  15&quot; rims all the way around; early spindles
front and big nuts in back.  Fairly rust-free...the worst place is
the right rocker panel, with 1 1/2&quot; hole and a few 1/4&quot; or less holes.
Also some surface rust around the rain gutter - it sat outside for
a while.  Inside, it has the original panels (some are kind of beat)
and headliner - a few rips and tears but not saggy.  No middle seat,
front seats seem to be re-covered originals.  Six pop-outs.

It runs well enough to drive around the block but it needs more
maintenance before embarking on a road trip.  Once I have it
running well enough to take a trip, I will evaluate engine/trans
and decide whether paint or new mechanicals are next.
