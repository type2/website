&gt; Eric- Check your chamber volume computations.
&gt; 78 Stroke X 90.5 Bore x .050&quot; Deck and 7-7.5 CR
&gt; will require 69-75 cc  chambers. Not gonna happen.
&gt; Then there's the camshaft Torque vs. HP debacle.
&gt; Torque is good for town and mudholes.
&gt; Power pukes out at 5K, and no top.

78 stroke, 90.5 bore. With 57cc's in the head, and a 10cc dish in the
piston, you can go with .065&quot; deck, which is plenty of squish for a street
motor gives you 7.5:1 CR.

I don't see a need to go over 5Krpm in a bus myself. Plenty of low end
torque is what will make a bus a happy driver around town, and if he's
running a .82 4th, with a 3.88 r&amp;p, I don't see him needing to go over 5k
myself.
