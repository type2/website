Subject: re-engine,etc.


I want to re-engine my 64 bus. has anyone out there re-motored with a new 
mexican motor as used in the still produced &quot;panorama&quot; bus(70's)? is this a 
practical swap how about using the motor and trans as a unit? I'm interested 
in knowing the drawbacks(besides cost!).it sure would be nice to have a nice 
new factory motor to push us around-cheers-ric bradner
