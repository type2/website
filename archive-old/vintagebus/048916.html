I love the discussions that can be created by one simple little post.  And the post, in this case, was merely a fleeting idea I had over lunch the other day.  Idea in question is the conversion of a 15 Window to a 23 Window.  

As those of you who know me, at least via emails, I'm a stock *pure* kinda guy.  O.K., every now and then I come up with an off center idea, but it's rare.  I love stock buses, all of my buses are stock.  Nothing against lowered or customized buses.  It's like the straight vs. gay issue.  I'm straight, but I could also care less if someone's gay.  They're life, not mine.  In this case their bus, not mine and vice versa.

Anyway, back to bus content.  As I think I mentioned, I won't be converting my bus.  I was never that serious in the first place, just wanted to know if anyone had ever done it.  The main reason I'm not going to do it stems from a phone conversation I had with an individual the other night.  This individual is supposedly VERY knowledgeable about buses.  He's not on this list, I don't think he's into computers, the Internet or mailing lists.  Anyway, he told me something I found very interesting, which I would like to see if anyone on the list can confirm.

Supposedly, all 15 Window buses were special orders from the factory.  I had never heard this before.  Is this true?  It seems that if this were true more people would be aware of it.

Robert
