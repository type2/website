I think there might already be rear safaris for trux; I know
Roger Nang came all the way up to Sacramento to hack the
rear window frame out of a junkyard single cab so he can give it
to a safari manufacturer as a template.  He explicitly needed
a '66/'67 window, 'cause they're different.

&gt; This would make sense on a bus but has anyone tried it on a Double Cab or
&gt; Single Cab. It seems you would be far enough away from the exhaust to not
&gt; be an issue? I love the idea of more ventilation but only if it can
&gt; actually be used.
