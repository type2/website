You are right..... the 34 PICT3 clogs up real nice! The one I have now
(third try) works perfectly and no problems........ Just took two to get
there though, and I also spent about $10 on each and not a lot of time
diagnosing this obvious problem either.....

&gt; I hate 34-picts as when they clog up they are hard to clean.
