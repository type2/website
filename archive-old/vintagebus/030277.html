It never happens this way but just so you don't give up hope and start cutting on
that standard you have. A close freind of mine up in Seattle called and said he
wanted me to keep an eye out for him. He has a 67 Pearl White Westy now and wants to
add a Double Cab to the stable. So i get the call from him about 2 weeks ago saying
he found one out in some field. It was missing the gates and looked really ratty. He
was wondering if he should bother trying to get it. Being the scrounge that I am I
told him if he would'nt that I would come up and get it and tow it home. After a
little digging he tracks down the owner who tells him he could have it. My friend
tells him he would be willing to give him a little for it but in the condition it is
and without gates it would not be worth a whole lot. The guy comes back and tells
him he can just have it and by the way the gates are under my house along with some
metal hoops and that canvas thingy. So for $175 delivery fee. My buddy ends up with
a Pearl White 67 Crew Cab with gates (except the rear one), complete with bows and
canvas tilt. After collecting some parts it is going to go to the paint shop and be
fully restored from the get go. It is fairly amazing to stumble on to this kind of
find, but to stumble onto a find like this when you aren't moving 5 states away or
having twins or some other act of nature that usually works to negate the
acquisition of another vehicle, is simply a miracle. He was looking for a Double Cab
and given his first choice he would have tried to find a 67 Pearl White one. So keep
looking NQ. They are out there. And I swear on my Double Cabs title that this is an
absolutely true story. As a matter of fact if any of you know of a good restoration
shop in the Seattle area let me know so I can pass the info along to him.
