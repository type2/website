Subject: ADMIN: The Library is missing some books!

Hello all!

There's nothing like having a once-dead link end up pointing to a porn
site to get you off your butt about updating your Web pages.  :)  I
have finally completed a pass through the Library at type2_dot_com that
I started (mumble) ago.

You will note that some of the articles in the Library are now marked as
dead links.  I have also compiled a list of all the dead links I found,
and included it at the end of this message.  I know that some of these
documents are probably dead and gone, some of them have been misplaced
on type2_dot_com, and some of them probably just need minor adjustments in
the URLs.  I will be chasing each one of these myself, but any input from
the lists would be great! 

If anyone knows more current URLs for these documents, please p-mail me
and let me know what they are.  Any other information, like a contact
for the author, etc, would be helpful as well.  Please send these to
me, mattroberds_at_home_dot_com, directly, and not to the list.

Thanks very much for your help!

Matt Roberds
Type2_dot_com Librarian (ssshhhh!)
