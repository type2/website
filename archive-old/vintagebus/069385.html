Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

What size fuse should these H4 have 25amp?  Looking at the webpage you
recommend helped a great deal.. However onequestion reminds. Does the Dimmer
relay stay in the circuit and that's what activates the relays for low and
high.

I'm running 3 additional 10 g wires from the battery in the back.  They will
be fused back there.  One wire for low beams and one for High beams, the
other will be for a set of Hella Driving lights.  I get off a 2330hrs and
drive 26 miles on a Country road with Deer.
