&gt; So does $200 sund reasonable?
&gt;

WHEN you see them at swaps, and that is not often, they usually run around
$250-275 and I wouldn't describe them as mint, although the sellers usually
do. Sometimes with the switch, sometimes without. If I were buying them, I
would think $200 sounded reasonable. If I were selling them I would not.
That is why I don't have any. 8^)
