This might be a good time to let you all know that I am now stocking some
A.H. Schofield body repair panels from the U.K.  This includes the lower
windshield channels that are mentioned above.

Alan's sheet metal has been mentioned on this list before, as he makes a
number of pieces that aren't available elsewhere (or, if available, not in
decent quality).  He also resells other companies' panels; those are not
worth buying from him as I can get them cheaper elsewhere.  So only the ones
he actually makes are of interest.

Various resellers have imported some of Schofield's metal in the past (and
present), with prices being all over the board depending on who was doing
the selling.   Alan's business is pretty much a one man operation (okay, two
men and a dog, to be exact), and not exactly high-tech. He's a craftsman,
not a businessman, which may have something to do with why his product never
got much of a foothold outside of the U.K.  As a two man/one dog shop, he
just can't produce the volume that, say, Veng/Klokerholm of Denmark can, and
his marketing is not exactly flashy.   But he does make some nice products.

I've actually been carrying some of Alan's '68-79 bus sheet metal for quite
some time (although I never advertised it as such), and have been more than
satisfied with the quality.  After several requests by customers, I decided
to try adding some of his splitty metal to our mix.  This is an experiment
and I've started with a few pieces in relatively small quantity.  I would
welcome and appreciate any feedback on other pieces that should be added to
the mix.

You can find a list of the pieces I currently have in stock at
http://busdepot_dot_com/ASP/SearchProdId.cfm?ProdId=ahs .  The part numbers
reference the diagrams on http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page15.htm and
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page16.htm .  So my part number AHS5, for
example, is item number 5 on his diagram.

If you would like other Schofield sheet metal that I do not have, my next
container will be leaving the UK in a couple of weeks and arriving in early
to mid January.  Email me for specific price quotes. (I have to contact the
UK for each quote, so please, serious inquiries only!)   If the part you ask
about is not actually his product, and can be had less expensively from
another source, I'll let you know that too.
