&gt; Hey, I live in annapolis and have been on the lookout
&gt; for a split for a while and that price range sounds
&gt; right.... buuut, there is definately NOT a foot of
&gt; snow here and I will be in contact to see what I can
&gt; do about possibly taking on a new project. thank you,
&gt; and yes...pleeaase send me the contact info before
&gt; Dicks Autohaus (you'd understand the rush if you knew
&gt; the area) gets a hold on it.
&gt;      sincerely,
&gt;         jd wilson III

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I recently bid on a bus on eBay. (I am not the
&gt; &gt; seller.) The selling
&gt; &gt; price was $165. I did not win, but the winning
&gt; &gt; bidder is backing out -
&gt; &gt; and contacted me to see if I was interested.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All glass, interior items (might even have a middle
&gt; &gt; seat), good front
&gt; &gt; bumper (slash w/overriders), engine of questionable
&gt; &gt; state, wheels and
&gt; &gt; good tires, some good sheet metal - what a deal you
&gt; &gt; say!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh, the catch - it doesn't run &lt;obviously&gt; and is in
&gt; &gt; a swampy truck yard
&gt; &gt; (probably under a foot of snow). Has a &quot;rusty front
&gt; &gt; end&quot; probably from
&gt; &gt; sitting in said swamp. AND it is in Annapolis MD. In
&gt; &gt; other words, it is
&gt; &gt; a parts bus and you gotta pull it outa there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you are interested, I'll send you the picture and
&gt; &gt; the seller contact
&gt; &gt; info. (Got one response from my last post.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Disclaimer: This is a VintageBus List special deal
&gt; &gt; only. I am in no way
&gt; &gt; affiliated with the seller. I am not making money on
&gt; &gt; this tip. etc. etc.
&gt; &gt; etc. SO DON'T FLAME ME!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Conrad
