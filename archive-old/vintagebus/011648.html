Subject: nose skins and dashboards
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 12:36:53 -0700

To all - 

Any help with the following questions would be greatly appreciated. This is
my first split - cut my teeth on bay windows. I have a '66 21-window that I
have begun to restore...

1. Does anyone make replacement nose skin?
2. What's the going rate for one hacked off a wrecked bus?
3. How hard is it to put on - anyone done this before?
4. With the exception of the blinker lights - are nose skins the same from
60 - 67?
5. Is it easier to get a nose skin with a dash already attached?
6. Are the dashes the same? - with the exception of the cutout for the
clock

My nose skin  is good until you get down to area above the bumper. Here the
PO has tried to pull out a good size dent with a puller - drilled lots of
holes - didn't do a very good job. The area below the lip which has the
holes for bumper mounting has started to rust-out in places. I guess I was
wondering if it would be easier to replace the bottom half of the nose or
do the whole thing......I guess I'm just exploring my options...

My dash has had lots of extras added to it, (lots of holes), and I would
like to return it to stock....One item I'm not sure about is the
rear-window defogger switch.... Was this a dealer add-on? It's mounted on
the left side of the steering column part of the dash (perpendicular to the
dash), and has 2 wires that run in the channel below the skylight windows
to the rear glass.

Sorry for so many questions..... Any input would be appreciated.


Thanks
Rob
