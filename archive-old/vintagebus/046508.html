Hi Hart,
How about taking it apart and repairing it?  We posted some Emails about 
fixing/repairing and soldering all the riveted connections inside of the 
headlight switch to rid it of electrical resistance several months ago!  So 
check the archives for these and if you have any questions we would be happy 
to hear them!   Eric&amp;Barb
