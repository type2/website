Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Vent Wing Window Problem

I've been asked by a number of people to do this job since I have the
jig... and I've loaned the jig out only to have it returned un-used
because people don't want to tackle the job even with the tool.

I'm actually stuck with the double cab on this job, after not liking how
the first (ok, second) attempt turned out (I didn't like how the rubber
folded under the little metal rain deflector) so I pulled them apart
again.  The sticking part is that I can't source some nice original
looking rivets for the latch mechanism.  The WW ones are just too wrong.
But if I had the rivets, they'd be back together tomorrow!  I do have
some NOS rivets for the top pivot though.

Harry suggested:
Does anyone need a part time occupation? Set up some jigs, practice on
Bug vwings until you're an expert, then go into business. Branch off
into other classic vehicles if you'd like. Become the Vent Wing Assembly
Guru of the Universe! Just a suggestion, my brain wasn't doing anything
else.
