&lt;&lt; So what's the story on these eyebrow thingies anyway?
 do they have some practical purpose or are they just a way 
 to make the front of your bus look_more_human?

 &gt;&gt;They do a pretty good job keeping the fuzz off my back for illegal head
lights.  Been running H-4's for the past couple of years (these are some kick
ass head lights), the eyebrows stop a lot of the brightness on the front of
the bus.  But I think most folks like the  human like stuff to.  It's pretty
much just a nice way to dress up the front of most VW's.
   Peace, Love, and btw H-4's can be bought from anywhere from 25-35 dollars a
piece, no more night blindness!!!
