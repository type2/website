I had a similar problem with my 75 scirocco...  It turned out to be a bad
battery ground strap... actually, I had painted the transmission up real
nice which caused the ground strap and bolt to not make good contact.  Sure,
the ohm meter read that there was no resistance but when you started pushing
alot of current as with the starter and headlights, the resistance went way
up.

Lesson learned!
