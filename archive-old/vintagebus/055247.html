&gt; I was just thumbing through one of the new VW rags
&gt; and
&gt; stumbled upon an article that left me with a
&gt; question.
&gt; What would the definition be for an &quot;original bus&quot;.
&gt; I
&gt; would assume that an original bus would be
&gt; unrestored.
&gt; That means cleaned up and displayed. It doesn't seem
&gt; right to have had the vehicle painted,
&gt; re-upolstered,
&gt; accessories added and then displayed as original.
&gt; The
&gt; bus in question is a VERY nice bus but as far as i
&gt; am
&gt; concerned NOT original. Stock yes, original no. Am I
&gt; off here?
