Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to shift into first and second??

Try pushing down (like reverse) and then doing 1st/2nd.  After I put a tranny 
in my 61 it was fine- then suddenly it seemed that 1st/2nd were gone!  II 
adjusted the shifting (loosen 13mm bolts at bottom of shift stick and shift 
the plate shightly) and it is fine.

 &gt; I recently installed a new tranny in my '61 bus and 
 shifting into first and
 &gt; second is really tough. Reverse, third and fourth are 
 OK.   I found some
 &gt; info in the archives on this but I'm still not 100% 
 clear on how to adjust
 &gt; the shifter.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
