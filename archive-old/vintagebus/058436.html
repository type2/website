Sorry Clara, My fault, I forgot about the single/dual circuit switch over
halfway through the year! Don't want to be giving bad advice!

the '67 ' master cylinder was started partway into the 67 model year.  your
bus may take the 55 to early 67 master cylinder.  I d advise you to look
under you bus and check- is the reservoir a round thing (single circuit), or
a rectangularish thing with two areas separated by a ridge in the middle so
the if one half of the reservoir drains the other side does not(dual)

the earlier mcs are much cheaper

then again, your mechanic may have a good souce for the dual circuit ones,
why don't you ask?

My mechanic says that my master cyclinder is what almost caused me to crash 
the other day. He says he can fix it for 141.00.  Is this right? From every 
magazine i've looked in , the 67 only master cyclinder is at least 200 
dollars. how can he do this? i must be missing something.
