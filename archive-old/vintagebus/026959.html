&gt;Ideally, the bus should not need any altering, only the seats.

I've considered this as well, though I've not done anything to
date.  I have an extra set of 1/3, 2/3 seat frames and a set
of buckets out of a 1970s V*lv*.  My plan was to strip all
the V*lv* hardware of the bottom of the seats and weld
bus mounting hardware to the bottom of them so there
wouldn't be any damage to the bus.  In theory, they'd just
slide in on the driver's side and &quot;tilt&quot; in on the passenger
side.  The space in the middle would be a good place
for a storage compartment of some sort, fastened to
the left side of the passenger seat.
