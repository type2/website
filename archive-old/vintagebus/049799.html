Subject: Re: Parts for my classroom


I have the original fried-egg lens that was hidden under the Xmas tree to
signify Pandora, but her lenses turned out to be okay, I'd love to
contribute to making math fun somewhere somehow. Jamie, could you send your
street address?

You'll be needing an inverter too. Actually I think what those young people
need is the euphonious tone of a VW HORN.

&gt;A month or so ago I got a nose clip from a splittie bus.  Since my class
&gt;room is filled with VW paraphernalia, I was thinking of using the clip as
&gt;my podium ;0)  It's a little hard to make math an interesting subject, so I
&gt;thought I might be able to living things up a bit.  I was thinking about
&gt;wiring the lights and turn signals to flash when a student made a correct
&gt;answer.  Does anyone have old fried egg turn signals and a pair of head
&gt;lights that the would like to donate or sell cheaply?  I would appreciate
&gt;the help.  Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;PS  I did use the displacement of a Volkswagen engine to teach direct
&gt;variation.  The kids got a kick out of it ;0)

&gt;Joy thru air,
