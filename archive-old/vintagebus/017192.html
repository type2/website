I had fun with this one the last time I was buying tires.  Every tire
that came up on the computer was was a &quot;great tire&quot;&quot; - so the next time
he said it, I asked &quot;So have you ever runt hose on one of your cars?&quot;
Um, no.  &quot;Have you ever seen one of those tires?&quot;  Um, no.  Have
you personally actually ever sold one?    Um, no...

&gt; I have a feeling that Wendy would call any tire a &quot;pretty nice tire&quot; :)
&gt; that price sounds reasonable, and I know from personal experience that the
&gt; tires are good.
