Did dave use the 36 this year!?
Last year (1999) he had a 1600 DP with the 36 stored in the back as a spare.

Give me a brake!  Dave Easterwood drove a 36 hp barndoor bus all the way from
GEORGIA and back.  You can make it a few hundred miles.  We're all right here
behind that screen you're starring at ready to answer all your questions.   
All
