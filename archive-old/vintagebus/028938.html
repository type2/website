steve, scott, etc....

    i think i saw somewhere on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled that the Sermons by
Bob Hoover are NLA... due to a dispute between the CD-maker and the Bus Depot....
    that's what i get for procrastinating.... no personal copy of the Sermons.
    but Bob did have a lot to say about the %*)*%%# filter-pumps... i think mainly
that you really have to measure them well before using them. check the pump's OD
(and all other critical dimensions, IMHO) against a new VW pump to be sure... often
the filter pumps have an incorrect OD, and will suck air instead of oil... Eric &amp;
Barb were able to obtain (?) an actual VW-issue filter pump that had the correct
dimensions, i think.... anyways that's what the Mexican 'dubs are running in these
times of hydraulic lifters and whatnot where you need pristinely clean oil all the
time.... as if we didn't need it anyways. :)
    the *best* system is a true full-flow oil filtering system... where the outlet
side of the oil pump is plugged, and a special oil pump cover installed that
diverts outlet oil out of the case, through the high-quality oil hose, through your
spin-on filter adapter.... through another high quality oil hose and back into the
engine case through a fitting installed in the main oil galley, left case half in a
boss almost halfway up the edge of the case .... that is true full flow. all of the
oil, all of the time.
    *** there *is* a variation on this style.... a banjo-style return fitting that
will bolt in place of the oil *control* valve on the front (front is front) of the
bottom left case half.... this way you don't have to drill and tap into the case,
but the downside is that you have an inch or so less effective clearance between
engine vitals and the ground, etc.... only for engine cases having *both* oil
pressure relief AND control valves, though....
    some people use the top-of-the-engine-case adapter thing which bolts over the
former location of the original oil cooler to plumb in a larger cooler and also a
spin-on filter adapter... this only filters part of the oil, part of the time... i
have also heard it said that cooling is impeded, since the air restriction offered
by the oil cooler which was designed into the system is no longer there...  dunno
the technicals on that one, though I have heard of people fabbing a cooler-shaped
piece of sheet metal to accomodate the shape of the blockoff adapter and still fill
out the silhouette of a real cooler... but if you are going to do that, you might
as well go to the trouble of installing a real full-flow system.
    If it was me.... i'd replace those oil lines as well as the fittings that
attach to them... IIRC that's either a 45 or 60 degree flare (for most of the
better pre-man hoses and systems out there...)... a lot of leaks like this are
simply due to overtightening... mangles the sealing areas, etc....
    the last full flow setup i installed was on a friend's '69 type I... i located
the filter mount under the left rear fender, and attached a shield in front of the
filter to protect it from road debris and so on.... you might need to do something
similar in your situation.
    hope i have left nothing out....

later...

&gt; Scott,
&gt;
&gt; Get hold of a copy of the &quot;Sermons&quot; by Bob Hoover.  He has lots to say about
&gt; the suspect quality of most of the filter pumps out there.  Ken Hooper who used
&gt; to administer the list should know how to get a hold of a copy.
