I was just out back looking through some stuff I threw in the barndoor a couple years ago and came across some tent stuff.  From looking at Thom's web page I discovered that the poles at least are from a Westfalia tent.  I have enough to make a square, with the two arms that attach to the two brackets on the roof.  I don't have the support poles that go to the bumper, and I don't have any poles to make a peak to the roof of the tent.  Did Westfalia ever make a tent that didn't have the peak on the roof?  Does anyone have the rest of the poles I would need to make a complete set?  How about the aluminum mounts for the roof?

The tent that came with the poles is all a cream color, no stripes.  I haven't seen any original Westy tents without strips so I am assuming someone had this one made.  Is this a good assumption?

I also have an unrelated sun shade sort of thing.  It is made from brown and white striped canvas with a scalloped sort of edge around it.  It is the same canvas a friend's original bus awning is made of, but it only goes out about 4 feet.  Any idea what this might go to?  I don't have any poles for this one yet either.

Thanks,
Richard
