all this talk of redoing bumpers...now i have a question. I had mine blasted,
and galvanized last fall. I am planning on pwderocating them when I have some
money.

The question is about attaching them to the body of the bus...there is no type
of spring system there, basically the bumper just gets dented (or the
frame)when it gets hit, has anyone ever tried to wokr around this?
