This is absolutely no offense againist Charlie, he is
a friend of mine.  But, I take your (MArk's) post as a
bit of a personal flame at me, someone you do not
know.

To defend myself and my posts, I must admit I have
quite high credentials in the &quot;westy field&quot; and I dare
say (and many listees will atest) I have owned more
so-23s or even hatch tops then anyone...they are my
fav and my pet peeve years before they were &quot;cool&quot;. 
Please call Charlie he will even atest to my
credentials!

Maybe this can put it to rest, I have a nice so-23 `61
brochure with a dove blue bus on the cover with
safaris on the front and yes....black and yellow
plaid.

Mr. Swangstu???
