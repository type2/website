Subject: 67 Master Cylinder

I have a 67 that I ordered a new 68-71 master cylinder for, intending to
switch it over.  When I look at the two side by side they look identical to
me, except for the slightly smaller barrel on that accepts the pushrod on
the new one.  Could it be that someone already converted it?  A picture of
the two side by side is at:

The pushrod from the pedal mechanism doesn't appear to have ever been filed
down, but it seems to have no play in it and keeps the master slightly
depressed when I mount it. Any help is appreciated.
