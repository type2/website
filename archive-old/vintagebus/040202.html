Hey all,

	I was wondering, is it okay to put a fuel filter (one of the
mediocre orange ones) BOTH in front of and after the fuel pump.?

	Yea or Nay.  If Nay,  then where is the best place and finally....
What is the best filter to use.

	I was stupid enough to run near empty and sucked up some crap from
the tank.  Since cleaning the tank is not an option right now, I want to
make sure no crap gets into the carb?

	THANKS for the info!!!
