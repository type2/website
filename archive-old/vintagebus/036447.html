 soaked it with penetrating oil, but don't want to use
 a torch on it as it is less than an inch away from the
 insulation around the main heat duct.  I may resort to
 using a torch if I can rig up enough insulation and
 heat shielding. &gt;&gt;

About an hour ago, I pushed the heat duct insulation far enough away from the 
shift rod to use heat, and it worked fine on my '61 Flip seat Westy.  Just 
undo the clamp by unscrewing it, and work off the insulation.  I was very 
careful not to breathe the dust in case there's any asbestos.  Haven't gotten 
the coupler off yet, but there's plenty of room for a flame.  I have a spare 
front coupler, but apparently the red plastic type has the same dimensions 
between the screws, so that would work to replace a cut one.

Good luck,

JP
