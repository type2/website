&gt;So the questions I pose, (before I drive down to the FLAPS to get another 
&gt;Mexican Hella) Are these Mexican ones inferior?

Probably some, but I have no hard data for this.

&gt;and/or is it odd for a new one out of the box not to work? 

The Idiot book does mention &quot;Once in a blue moon, they sell you a
bad one&quot; when talking about getting a new sensor that doesn't work.
So at least it happened sometimes back in the day...

&gt;and/or is there something I'm missing here?

If you really, really, really slathered sealant all over the threads
(which I don't think it needs as it's a taper fit), it might be remotely
possible that you insulated it electrically from the case.  I don't
think it's too likely, though.  To check for sure, use an ohm-meter
or powered test light between the hex flats and the terminal, with
the wire disconnected.  If it's open (infinite resistance) you have
a bad switch; if it shows continuity but it refuses to turn the
dash light on when hooked up, you might clean the sensor threads and
the threads in the case.

Again, IMHO, it's more likely that they sold you a bad one.

Good luck!
