Subject: Re: [VB] single cab wood strips

David,
No it is not typciall and the only time ive ever seen that is on special models like the binz or the
tieflader since they were forced to modify the length of the slats. The only reason i could think of
yours being cut (Assuming they havent been replaced some time ago) is that it would make it easier
to clean back there in that tight space when trying to wipe/clean dirt out/whatever in between all
those hydraulics and the rear wall. Those slats actually look too long to me. Are the shorter ones
not visible in your picture, also cut off?

Does that whole hydraulic assembly sit directly on the wood slats or is it slightly suspended above
it? If it does sit directly on the slats, are they crushed after all that weight sitting on them for
all these years with the hyrdaulic oil leaking onto them, and in turn loosened up the whole assembly
on the bed? Just curious.

I noticed that end of the wood strip next to the cab were cut off square and not tapered like at the
rear.  Is this typical?
