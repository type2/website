&gt;  No, not a Hitchcock question.  I'm wondering if all pre 64 rear (small)
&gt;  windows are the same (back to 55).  Are there bus/truck differences?
&gt; The back one in my truck is scratched (by me possibly when I took off
&gt;  the hideous window tint) and I'd like to replace it eventually.  The one
&gt;  I have is wider at the top (it seems) than at the bottom.  Are they all
&gt;  like that.   Thanks.

yes- all the truck ones are that sort of trapezoidal shape 65? and earlier.  
The 3/55 through 63 bus ones are rectangular.  BD back windows are like truck 
ones.  SO you gotta get a truck window or BD window if you want to replace 
it.  You could also try polishing.
