I never heard of a twist-disconnect thing that would handle this.

You can put a valve up near the tank, turn it off when you like, then drain
the rest of the system carefuly under your own terms and conditions into a
jar or something but...on the side of the road, in the real world, you're
pretty much resigned to taking a bath in it no matter what gizmos you have

of the popular needle-nosed vise-grips, using golf tees as temporary stops
when necessary.

But it's still going to be all over you. Gasoline is a horrifying substance
and it is regrettable that it ever got popular. If gasoline were newly
discovered today surely it would be thought of on a par with enriched
plutonium, it's just that we're used to it.
