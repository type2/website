&gt; Do you have any thoughts on concrete?  The thickness?  Additives (fiberglass

Steve, 

First, I live in the Northeast where ground freezes for extended periods of 
time.  I used air entrained concrete which helps with this.  If you are not 
in this climate, don't worry about it.  Use 4500 lb. concrete, about $3.00 
more per yard than 3500 lb and well worth it. Don't add (or allow masons to 
add) too much water.  It makes it easy for them to work with, but weakens the 
surface and it may chip or flake if you use too much water.  Standard detail 
around here is crushed stone, plastic vapor barrier, welded wire mesh and 
then concrete pour, usually a minimum of 4&quot;.  Masons should pull the mesh up 
into the pour with a rake as they begin to work the floor.  When I built my 
garage, I didn't use the mesh, I used # 6 rebar on a 2' grid.  I cost about 
$500 more for a 30X36 garage, but what I have is essentially a bridge deck, 
and has not cracked, settled or moved.  This is excess of standard 
construction, and is overkill in areas where frost heave / settling is not a 
factor.  Busses don't weigh a lot, so if your soil base and climate are not 
factors, wire mesh or fiberglas geo-grid will probably work fine.  Good luck.
