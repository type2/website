i recently got a double door panel with some early westy gear in it,   is
anyone interested,   i have rear seat,  front seat,  roof hatch, rear shelf
and some parts of the side closet,   they are still in usable shape but not
great,  i am in the pacific north west-they are bulky and would be a pain to
ship so pickup would be the best thing-    let me know the price will be
right-   john
