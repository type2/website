Subject: Was carb icing... now, who knows?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.3.96.1000915121348.16632k-100000_at_pdx444.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;


Well, my hesitation/missing problem appears not to be carb icing as far as
I can tell. The next question is, what is the problem? Here are the
details:

New 1600 SP (~700 miles on engine)
Solex 30 PICT-2 carb
Doghouse cooler/shroud/fan
Preheat tube connected
stock oil bath air cleaner
stock exhaust/heater boxes
all tin sealed
thermostat connected and functioning
timing 10 deg. btdc _at_ idle
       30 deg. btdc _at_ full advance
new cap, rotor, plugs, plug wires
pertronix points replacement
voltage _at_ coil+ looks good (~13v _at_ idle, ~14.5 _at_ &gt;1200 rpm)

Symptoms:

Bus runs horrible until engine warms up. Once it has been driven 10-15
minutes, runs great. Before warmed up misses/hesitates when under any
load. Can be driven if you really keep your foot out of it, but this is
difficult as &quot;keeping your foot out of it&quot; implies barely enough power to
accelerate at all when upshifting. Mostly a problem at lower rpm ranges,
right after an upshift. Once warmed up, runs like a champ. Never
misses/hesitates.

Anyone have any ideas? Good things to check? I'm pretty much at my wits 
end...
