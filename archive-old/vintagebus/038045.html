&lt;&lt; I can't figure it out.... why a side step on a single cab....??? &gt;&gt;

Hi David,
If you need to load boxes or such over the sidegates due to having stuff in 
the bed already that would pour out if the gates were lowered.  Then the side 
step is really nice to have.  Eric&amp;Barb 
PS we are still looking for a steel diamond plate model of side step to match 
our VOA industrial look accessory diamond plate front and rear bumpers that 
are going to go on our 63 SC.  EEE&amp;B
