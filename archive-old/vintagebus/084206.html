Subject: Re: hot wire at light switch

Is the switch a 12v switch in your 6v bus?

I had a 12v switch in my '64 6v bus, and it worked
fine for short drives. On a long drive from Seattle
to Sacramento, the switch burned out near Portland
leaving me without lights. A friendly driver in a loaf
paralleled me until I coud get to a truck stop where
I bought a heavy duty switch to install.

Don't remember enough about the wiring to help
with that potential problem, but check to see if
the switch is the proper one.
