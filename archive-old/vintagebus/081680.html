Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Cover question

&gt; Hello Ron,
&gt; Checked out the bus cover. 
&gt; 
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=A0273
&gt; 
&gt; Looks good to me, think I'll order one. One question 
&gt; however..... many splitwindow buses have a radio antenna 
&gt; mounted on the front. In my case on the extreme right hand 
&gt; front just below the passenger front window. Typical location 
&gt; for many splitties I think. Do your covers have provisions 
&gt; for this, such as slits or zippers or is it one size &quot;is 
&gt; supposed to fit all&quot;. Picture in the example looked like a 
&gt; bay window bus with no antenna.


The cover was designed by Just Kampers in England to fit all busses. This
one is well designed; I have never had a single complaint about the fit.
However, none of the covers I sell have a hole pre-cut for the antenna. The
reason is that antennas (antennae?) on busses were dealer-installed, not
factory-installed, so the exact location could vary.  So you would have to
cut a hole yourself.
