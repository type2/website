Was it me or did RIch Stewarts 60 westy (dove blue) not have red/black 
interior cushions??????

&lt;&lt; Well, my all original EARLY '59 Westfalia (production date of 11/5/58) is 
an SO-23 kit with yellow and black wool, so that throws out the previously 
posted logic.  My understanding is that the color of the wool fabric is not 
indicative of the year, but of the exterior color of the bus.  Dove Blue bus 
= yellow/black.  Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey bus = yellow/black.  Red/White bus 
= red/black.
