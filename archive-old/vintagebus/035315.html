Thanks NQ for the reminding me about these.  I heard about them last week and 
forgot to look at my local Walmart for them.   Read your story an hour ago, 
ran down to Walmart.  There were none on the displays but they had a big 
stack of the &quot;Show Stoppers&quot; on the top shelf.  Begged and pleaded with the 
toy dept girl to go thru them and we did, all 50 or so of them.  Netted 4 of 
them.  Bought them all.  I figured I could use the three extra ones to give 
as a finders fee for parts I need.  I know this sounds cheezy ( I will save 
you the time of telling me that), but hey you never know.  I need the parts, 
and someone may need one of these toys.  Maybe enough to spur their memory or 
give them some ambition to go look thru that pile of parts for what I need.  
Go to:  http://hometown.aol_dot_com/bussesnbugs/PARTSHOME.html
to see a pic of what we are talking about (if you havent already) and see my 
extra parts for sale and my parts wish list.

 Saturday I went out to Walmart to look for the bus/beetle combo that  has so
 far been hard for me to find.  I came home empty handed. :-(
 
 Later I hooked up with Rob via net meeting and we chatted about the elusive
 combo.  Kevin Sullivan (mutual friend of ours) had tried on
