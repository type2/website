 OK folks another of my many questions.  The door handle on a 67 Bus, how do
 they come off?  This 67 Panel has 2 different doors and one simply screws on
 and the other I'm not sure.  I've tried looking behind it for a clip that
 you pop out and a pin, but don't notice either.  I know I missing something
 here.  I ask also because I get to take a week off to head to Virginia and
 strip a 66 (I think) and what's left of a 61 or older.  Not much on the
 older other then Speedometer, switches, Bullet Housing (going on my 67) and
 what I think is the cool Church key style gas door.  Anyway that one has
 some neat looking chrome door handles I want to get off.
  &gt;&gt;
which door are you referring to?  and the inner or outer handle?  the chrome 
ones in the front doors inside on what year?
