Subject: Re: [VB] South-West area camper warning

I was camping earlier this summer in SoCal, nearest
cilization I can thnk of is Corona.  The coyotes were
howling up a storm in the middle of the night, which was
cool, until antoher camper's yap-o-matic went ballistic.
Where's the duct tape when you need it most?
