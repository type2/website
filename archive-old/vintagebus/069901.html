Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

&gt; &gt; My feeling is that if during the production of splits (that ran around 17
&gt; years compared to Bay production
&gt; &gt; that lasted 12 years) were it found beneficial to change the design of the
&gt; air intakes I think it would have

Maybe the term necessary instead of beneficial would be better.
It is a major design change cosmetically as well a structurally.

&gt; just not going to be cutting it. The louvers in themselves, will become a
&gt; restricton, thus creating a vacuum in the engine bay, which is going to pull
&gt; hot air through every little gap in your cooling tin and recirculate it. The
&gt; cooling fan begins to cavitate, being unable to pump the amount of air that
&gt; is needed to properly cool the engine. Remember, the cooling fan needs to
&gt; produce pressure to be able to force the air through the fins of the heads
&gt; and cylinders. If the air you are pumping is already at a slight vacuum, and
&gt; you have to pressurize it, that's a substantal loss right there. The main
&gt; reason the pressure is needed, is the cool air hitting the hot cooling fins,
&gt; makes the air hot, making it expand, and thus, require pressure to be able
&gt; to foce it through that area.

The air in the engine bay is always going to be at a lower pressure.
Whether the restriction of the vents is significant would really need to
be either calculated or measured. What you seem to want to state as fact
is just conjecture on your part. Of course you could be right , or not.

And if the scooped shape of the bay intakes actually increases pressure
and/or fan efficacy also needs to be backed up with hard evidence.


&gt;
&gt; The bay window 'scoop' design was introduced well before the Doghouse shroud
&gt; was around, showing that the split bus louvers were becoming ineffective at
&gt; being able to handle the added cooling needs as it was. Introducing the

Wild guess stated as fact. We have no way to know how much of the design
was determined by engine cooling or mechanical design or aestetics
considerations.



&gt; larger 1500cc engine in 66 (over 11% larger than the previous 1300) in my
&gt; opinion is what sparked the design of the bay window bus. It only took two
&gt; years to see an approaching problem, and to redesign the Type 2 platform to
&gt; adapt to the cooling system needs.

Opinion yes well stated. Although since the bay window has so many changes
obviously unrelated to cooling I would suspect that the loaf was based
more on some perception of marketability and the feeling that they needed
a change. They could have more easily added high intakes to the existing
design.

&gt;
&gt; So the thing that needs focus, is providing the engine bay area with more
&gt; air than the stock louvers can provide if you are running an engine larger
&gt; than stock.

You could easily test this theory by cutting some more holes in the side
of your bus.



Putting on larger crank pulleys, or smaller generator pulleys to
&gt; spin the cooling fan faster is unfortunatly not going to eliminate the
&gt; cooling restriction that already exists. Same with adding additional oil
&gt; coolers. Sure, oil coolers will cool the oil down, but what about the heads
&gt; and cylinders? Those are still starving for air.

I disagree with your original premise that their is necessarily a
restriction at the vents.
As far as the pulley ratio. Empirical evidence tells me you are not quite
right. My ratio with stock parts was 1.6:1 Its been written by some fairly
experienced listees that it should be closer to 2:1. I dont know why some
stock setups could yield that ratio. AFAIK my lower pulley is the larger
size and Ive never heard of various sizes of VW gen pulleys. At any rate
for ME the porsche pulley got my ratio to 2.2:1 and it seems to make a
considerable difference in cooling and an unnoticable difference in power.

I also am not comfortable with oil coolers.

FWIW

peace
