It just takes it to long to thaw out the windshield on start up. I was hoping 
that there is a gas heater made to mount in the engine bay but blow only into 
the caped off side of the fork at the rear end of the heater tube so it goes 
right to the windshield in my sc. all of the bus heaters I've seen have had 
the vent for the rear passenger compartment. Or can I safely modify a bus 
heater? 
thanks

I have seen a couple trucks with the a Stewart Warner mounted in the treasure 
chest, forget how it vented to the cab.    Also seen an  Eberspacher manual 
instructions on how to install a heater in the spare tire area (you then have 
to stick the spare tire elsewhere.   The pic was of a panel van.  The heat on 
this came out the bulkhead between the drivers feet. 

what year's you truck?  small heat tube or bigger heat tube?  the kind with 
the lever that flips up/down oor the bit that goes side to side to turn the 
heat from feet to defrost?   do you just have insufficiant volume?   Check 
for leaks, that the system is all sealed.  How is the insulation on the long 
heat tube?  Do you have a thermostat set up- helps warm up quicker.

My VWs tend to like to warm up  in the morning for a bit before I drive this 
time of year anyway.
