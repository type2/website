Subject: RE: [VB] headliners - fuzzy vs. perforated

I think if you do anything less than removing the original headliner,
re-weave any problem areas, re-dye the fabric using original/period
chemicals, and then re-install, you just aint even sh*t.

... hey, he asked for it :-)~




Rob asked:

list:

my early '63 15 window (production date of july 1962), came originally with
a fuzzy cloth headliner.  with the understanding that someone will flame me
for even thinking of putting in a perforated headliner, i am seeking
opinions of comparing cloth headliners vs. perforated.

while everyone knows i'm a *stock guy*, the '63 model year was the first
year of the perforated headliner (i think).  since i have a '63 deluxe, it
would not stand out if i put a perforated headliner in it.  i'm considering
doing that if in fact perforated headliners have better longevity, are
easier to clean up, are more water stain resisitant, etc.  in other words,
if perforated makes more sense from a useability standpoint, then i think i
should consider that.  if on the other hand both materials hold up just as
well, then i'm leaning toward keeping the bus as it was originally built.

any comments or suggestions are more than appreciated.  i can take the
criticism as well, so feel free to blast if you're in that kind of mood
today.
