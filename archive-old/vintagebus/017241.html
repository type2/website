None of my cars have A/C.  When it's really hot, I prefer to drive the
bus over the 911 because it's more &quot;shaded&quot;.  The bright yellow
helps keep it cooler, too.  I wish I'd insulated the roof like I'd 
originally planned.  Oh well.  The cargo area becomes unbearable!  I'm
glad this bus isn't a walk-thru!

I think I need to check my timing or something; I drove it yesterday
afternoon, and it got HOT!  Barely failed the Minnesota dipstick test,
but the sheet metal above the engine was HOT!
