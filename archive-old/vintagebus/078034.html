Subject: Bus needed in central cal for photoshoort

&gt;They didn't want my doublecab and Karl's 13 window &gt;is causing people to open doors on every street he &gt;drives down.

Man, you guys are fast.

I can see how they might not be looking for a truck, what do you mean about Karl's bus? Opening doors?
To check it out? To shoot at it?
Why didn't they want it? How's Karl taking it?

&gt;Dave Smith is the marketing director for Pelco, nice &gt;guy. Mention my name if you see him.

In doing a lot of work for schools/jails/hospitals at my work (EE), we deal with Pelco a lot also. I'm sure my boss knows Dave as well. Don't know who I'll see, but I'll say hi. 

&gt;Should be a fine day in the foothills. We can meet &gt;at Sequoia Brewery, formerly Butterfields

I know the place. They say over at 5pm, will it take me an hour to get back into the tower from the 41/145 interchange? Can't really figure it on Mapquest.

Billy
