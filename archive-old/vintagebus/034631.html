Was the passenger-side, dash-mounted grab handle an option in 58?  My 58 sc
doesn't have one (much to my wife's chagrin), but I've seen pictures of 58
buses that do have them.  I'd like to install one, but am a little hesitant
to drill holes in my un-cut dash.

standard on a barndoor.   For post barndoor through 60, it was an option, I 
have seen two kinds.   

one is cast aluminium with a white vinyl (prbably yellowed now) insert

other is the 3 part kind with aluminum ends that can be polished to a high 
shine, and a black painted center tube that has tringle notches in te ends 
that go into the triagle bumps in the end pieces when installed so the tube 
doesn't roll.    these are like the barndoor style, but a differnt size.   
like teh round tube on the 50's middle seats.
