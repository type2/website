Subject: re; bus decorations, BBB III update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

at pomona last week there was a bus there i think
from box on wheels he had lights all over it they were run by an inverter, converts 12 volts to 110
so you can run 110 things from it, i've seen them in harbor frieght and northern hydralics books
if you really want this look up these companys on the web they both have sites you can order from.

UPDATE   BUSES by the BRIDGE III
RANCHO PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION
has donated a 3.88 rebuilt bus trans to the raffle
at BBB III that will go along nice with the turn key rebuilt (donated by LONDON BRIDGE BULLIS)1600
duel port motor with doghouse cooler but no thermostat (unless somebody out there would like to donate all the pieces for this) kyle got my last set. Win this then the CHROME SAFARIS donated
by WOLFGANG INTERNATIONAL and all the other goodies being donated and you could put together 
a nice bus, but you need to be there and registered to win these, remember that proceeds from this event go to the ARIZONA HOME for ABUSED
CHILDREN so buy lots of raffle tickets.
other goodies road tool kit by MATCO TOOLS
and stuff from KYMCO MOTORSPORTS and WOLFSBURG WEST and the list grows
we don't want to forget WEST COAST METRIC the events major sponser
Thanks to SCOTT HALL for coming up with the complete longblock thats being totally rebuilt

ALSO  there will be a memorial set up at the registration booth for the FAMILY of JOSH RODGERS
to gather donations and such to send to his family
he won't be there in body but his spirit will

thanks to all ronnie LBB havasu connection
