Subject: Sump Studs Question


My sons engine has a stripped out sump stud and we are wondering about the 
best course of action to correct for the condition.  We could, of course, 
split the case and have it machined for a new stud of larger size... but 
want to know what others have done for this condition and how successful the 
effort was before we approach the problem. Helicoil? Tap a new stud w/o 
splitting the case? J-Weld?

We will be pulling the engine today to replace the main seal which has an 
irritating leak due to what appears to be a poor quality manufacture and the 
cooling tower seals so it is a good time to address this other &quot;problem&quot;.
