Subject: FW:  Chinese Tires

Howdy,

I may be able to help out on both of these issues.
I run a '84 Rabbit GTI in SCCA autocross and have had great success with the
Kuhmo radial tires, Victoracers(185-60-14).  These are a DOT tire but with a
very sticky tread compound, made to heat up quickly for an autocross run.  I
also have a set of street Kuhmo's on the GTI, and have been very pleased
with them.  

As for Bus tires, I went to www.tirerack_dot_com and found some really great
Dunlop SPLT5 185-14 tires, that are 4 ply, truck tires.  They have
blackwalls and are very beefy looking tires.  

Hope this helps y'all out,
