Subject: GL4 oil needed!~ HELP!

I am CLOSE to getting this engine in and my bus running in the next couple
weeks, some trival cost, yet important parts and time to go. I desperately
need gl4 75-90 or straight 90 for my trans, I will settle for either. I live
in PA, and can't find it anywhere. Please advise to mail order source, or
someother way to get it...I have called farm tractor stores, all the auto
parts houses (most haven't a clue), and am often told to use the gl5. I want
to be safer than sorry, even if I am wrong, please help with source! Will
pay to have shipped (1 or 2 gal) to me.....
Oilless in PA...
