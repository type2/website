Subject: RE: The Travelin' Fu's....last update

  Thanks to all that have replied with offers of help along Ricki Fu and
families path. I will give him all the info so he may contact you for some
conversation along the way. He is a great guy as is his family and wife.
This LIST has come through AGAIN in offering help to a bus traveler

For anyone interested, 

I just got off the phone with Ricky and they are all buttoned up and
starting like a champ.

They are kicking back in N'Awlins for a couple of days to check out Mardi
Gras.

Culprit=Bad Starter
Solution=AutoStick Starter (SR-17X) from Autozone in Baton Rouge.
