Subject: RE: [VB] 54 Barndoor

If I sit up straight, the top of the windsheild is at
eyeball level so I usually drive around town crunched
over the steering wheel (that after all the lectures I
give my daughter about the dangers of bad posture and
the values of sitting erect).  I am paranoid about not
seeing stoplights and running them in the city. (I
nearly did it on a couple of occasions and it scared
me).  The good thing is that on road trips you can sit
back and never need to lower the visor even in the
most blinding sun.  I once had a '51 Pontiac with a
sunvisor and it had a reflecting device on the dash so
that you could see when stoplights changed above you. 
Perhaps I should scrounge around and find one for my
bus.  Driving a bus is like driving a panzer...you
only have a small glass to look through to drive.

I am 6'2&quot;, by the way.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi list, nice to have you back. Has anyone else
&gt; been drooling on that 54
&gt; &gt; barndoor advertised on the samba? I have been, any
&gt; opinions or comments
&gt; &gt; would be appreciated ( good deal ? ). Also would
&gt; being 6'4&quot; be a problem
&gt; &gt; as far as being able to look out through the
&gt; windshield. It's not really
&gt; &gt; a problem in my 60's buses but I saw that factoid
&gt; about barndoor windows
&gt; &gt; being shorter and got worried. Is the roof lower
&gt; too or are the windows
&gt; &gt; just shorter? Any tall people out there with
&gt; barndoors?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'm 5'10&quot; or so and I can't sit back in my '55
&gt; Barndoor Kombi unless I sit
&gt; back and slouch.  I drive leaned over the wheel
&gt; which  is how I normally
&gt; drive anyway so it doesn't matter to me.
