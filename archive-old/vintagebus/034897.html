as Jerry said  &quot;the Thiefs&quot;  were at it again at Pomona

They took the Empi horn button and Empi gear shift knob  off the original 
1967 GTV bug.............that was parked in my space !   (anyone have a  
replacement)

    The piss off is this car sat the whole day at Kelly Park and nothing 
happened, Is it just the crowd at Pomona ? 
 Anymore its almost scary to go out in the cars for sale in the dark . I know 
many people who will not go and park there overnight, they are scared for 
their safety.
 
As far as the show, it was big as usual but never seemed to get going, with 
the March show rained out everyone thought this one would be great, it just 
was OK

The really &quot;Great&quot; Pomonas you cannot see across the  aisle there are so many 
people.....that just did not happen this time.........

Well the next on is June the week before OCTO / Classic weekend

hope to see you all there........
