&lt;&lt; My plan is to put the leaves from my trashed 61 beam into my 67 beam so as
 to even up the handling and ride back to factory specs, while retaining
 the advantages of 1 ton brakes... (even if i upgrade to a later transaxle,
 i'll still end up having the 61 torsions in back..) &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The front torsion springs are the same from Chassi No. 20 - 117 901 to 219 
300 000 Part number 211 411 033.
As for the rear torsion bars they are the same from Chassi No. 20 - 117 902 
on up to 1967.  Though there are three differant types for differant models 
of bus.
211 511 113 - Torsion bar, rear, length 590 mm models 211-268 (Delivery van, 
Micro Bus, Kombi, Pick-up)
211 511 113 A -  M140 (Fire truck)
271 511 113 - Torsion bar, rear, 26 mm dia. models 271-274 (Ambulance)
