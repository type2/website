&lt;&lt; Should that metal line run on around and through the tin (with a grommet)? 
 Seems like the rubber line could get cut up on the tin.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Yes it should.  You can use a two inch slit lengthwise section of flex fuel 
line to act as a grommet hose clamped around the metal fuel line as it goes 
through the sheet metal if you can not find a grommet of sufficent hardness 
to last more than two weeks.
 
&lt;&lt;Does anyone know the specs on a Bosch &quot;031&quot; distributor?  The full number 
is 0 231 129 031.  I'm trying to figure out if this is something close to 
&quot;right&quot; for this engine or if I need to change it out.&gt;&gt;
 Try http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/oldvolkshome/ignition.htm for the info 
you need.

 &lt;&lt;Is it possible that this was converted to sealed-beams sometime later in 
life, or...? &gt;&gt;
If it has only two wires (USA wiring.) to each tail light then not likely.
