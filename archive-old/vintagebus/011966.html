COuld be any number of things:

* rear wheel seal - fairly easy to fix
* seal between redux box halves - a bit more difficult, gotta split the box
* axle boot leaking, dripping along tube to the wheel (a stretch!)A

My '56 has been seeping for a while, but I haven't bothered to do anything 
about it yet.  Since I blew out the input seal last weekend, and
need to install new RD bearings, I'll probably do it all at the 
same time.
