&gt;  Well, not me, my engine.  I just installed an oil temperature gauge in my 
&gt; 66 ('71 engine w\1600 DP, 34 pict 3 carb, 009 Distributor, using 20W-50 
oil). 
&gt; Anyway, after driving for about 20 minutes in 70 degree weather, the gauge 
&gt; only reads about 150-160 degrees. IS THIS POSSIBLE? I used the oil plug 
type 
&gt; sender, so I realize I'm probably going to get the coolest reading from 
this, 
&gt; but can it really be running that cool, or did I probably do something 
wrong? 
&gt; BTW, after driving, I pull the dipstick out and I can touch the oil and rub 
&gt; it between my fingers without any burning issues.  So, what do you guys 
think?
&gt; ??
&gt;  
well, sounds like it feels cool, sp even you nerves are shot, or the guage 
reads pretty accurately.

yes, it can read like that.   takes about 1/2 hour for my VW to reach 
operating temp on the freeway, and would be about 150-160 running around town 
in 70* after 20 mins.  seems like its okay.
