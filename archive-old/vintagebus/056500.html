Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

Any image I take with my camera is copyrighted by me and stealing that image
is violating my copyright,plain and simple.

If I see images &quot;stolen&quot; from my site elsewhere on the web, I ask that they
be removed, as my time allows.  My time is short so I really only email
those people that create a whole other web site using stolen stuff with no
new content, because they are losers and need a good smack with the 'ol
crank handle.

On the other hand, I steal images off eBay every week for my Gallery, mainly
because those photos will be &quot;lost&quot;.

So if it bothers you David, I can remove those images from my Gallery, I
remove photos all the time.
