&lt;&lt; reading some of these stories really scares the shit out of me  :)  Never
 leave home without the trusty F**D. &gt;&gt;

I hope your not serious......if maintained and built properly, busses have
crisscrossed the country many times, and how about when they were new? Keys to
a Ford didn't come in the toolkit, last time I checked. I feel a little miffed
about this, because of the people I know who have put in the serious miles,
with nary a problem (this is where i should pat myself on the back for all the
miles I've done without incident, but there's too much of that already). If
done right, you don't need a support vehicle.
