Hi Brian
I can't help you with the 36 horse into Camaro transplant, however I have
had some experience parting out an old Hebmuller I inherited from my
Grandfather. Seems he never got around to driving it, and by the time I got
it the tires were pretty rotted and all the wiring and hoses were shot.
I decided to pull the 25 horse out of the back and stuff it into my
neighbors kid's Pinto. I wouldn't have done it but the Pinto was one of the
2+2 models with the cool all-glass hatch.
The project went pretty well, but nobody was around to help me lift the Heb
over the engine so I hauled out the torch and just cut through the crap
behind the motor. The Pinto ran great for a couple of weeks until the kid
rolled it one night after a kegger. We had some fun with the Heb
too...rolled it off a cliff into a quarry pond, it made a cool noise.
Gotta go, I'm cutting out the little windows in the back of my '50 standard
coupe so I can fit in one of those nice big rear windows from a 71 super.
