Hey john,
    i should have all the templates for you to use! shipping them would be
tough.but if you tell me ahead of time i will bring them to the next dbg
campout for you to use! you should start by trying to find a specialty wood
shop that can sell you
bendable baltic birch ,for the ceiling, in the euro size 5'x5'x1/8&quot;.also
4'x8'x1/8&quot; birch plywood(clear) for the walls.
if you can't find it in  give me a post and i will dig up the # of my wood
supplier in chicago.
    good luck,
    woody
    &quot;keep on pushin'&quot;

&gt; I am about to rebuild the interior of my EZ camper. It looks like the
&gt; existing camper interior is made up of odds and ends from several different
&gt; interiors. The wood shades and grains are of several varieties, and the
&gt; outside panel contours where the wood meets the inside walls of the bus do
&gt; not match up.
&gt; . If someone had actual plans and measurements for the panels for
&gt; cupboards, headliner, and wall panels I would be glad to ante-up for
&gt; expenses, shipping or whatever required. The PO installed some extremely bad
&gt; paneling on the wall of the driver's side and that definitely has to go.
