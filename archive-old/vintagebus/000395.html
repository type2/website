&lt;&lt; For those of you who have never tried swapping flywheels from 6V to 12V

 up to the flywheels.

well, you do need to use a stepped crank FW if you have a stepped crank in 
your motor. the SCFWs do not take the O ring.   You can use a SCFW on your 
later crank.

However, the crankshaft was not changed for the 67 model year, when our N Am 
spec VWs came standard with 12V.

111 105 271 is the 109 teeth, clutch 180, FW for 25hp, 36hp motors

the later crankshafts have the same mating to the FW (except for the earlier 
ones being stepped)

meaning you will have problems if you try to put a 36hp (6V) FW on your 1600, 
it wont work, the 36hp crank is smaller.  Use a post 36hp FW, it will work if 
you have the stepped thing right.   

The stepped thing generally comes into play if you want a bigger clutch, and 
you have a stepped crank, cause you could likely get an oil leak with an o 
ring FW on a stepped crank, so you would need that kind, or if you want a 12V 
FW on your stepped crank to put the motor in a 12V VW, in which case you 
should just put a 12V slonoid on your 6V starter.
