&lt;&lt; working on putting my 1600 back together so the old girl doesnt get towed.
 do i *need* one of these? or can i wing it? please reply asap, i have 36
 hours to start her up to prove shes worthy of being in my driveway :).
 thanks for any help.
 
 p.s. i know youre supposed to mark the flywheel/clutch so i can line them
 up. i did that, but not using the same flywheel. so alot of good that did me
 :). thanks again.

I used to do it w/o the tool, carefully feeling to see it was centered.  The 
disc between the clutch and flywheel needs to be centered, or the shaft out 
of the tranny won't lkine up, so you would put your finger in it and make 
sure it is centered.  feel around the edges in there,  but the tool is cheap 
and ooh so simple to use.  Get one. 

 This has nothing to do with attaching the clutch in the same place on the FW 
to keep ity balanced, that is a different thing.
