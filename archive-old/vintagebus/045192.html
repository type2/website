Hey Isaiah,
I believe that bus is Billy's, correct?...it was mine before.
VWHoward and Ronnie should remember those rings...i showed to em last 
Jerome....nobody else had ever seen them either.....figured must of been some 
brazilian part. or something...._dot_came in a VW box and all...I couldn't read 
the part number cause it was too faded.
I just picked them up in a package deal from some guy back in Vegas.
I'm waited to se if anyone else has seen em??/

Beto
Waco, TX
on the prowl for another bus...
