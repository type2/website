Subject: bolt pattern for drums and discs

Does anyone know what year the bolt pattern changed for the drums and discs
post '67?  I am thinking of changing the front brakes on Fritz to discs and
keep the rear stock.  I just spoke to a very knowledgable VW mechanic who
told me that while a 1968-1970 ball joint beam will bolt right up to Fritz
with no modification, I will need to find discs from a '71 or later (again,
they will bolt right up with the appropriate spindles to the '68-'70 beam).
When I did this, I was hoping to keep the bolt pattern for the rear drums
(and spare) the same as the front discs.  He told me that the drums from '71
on (same bolt pattern as the discs) will not fit '67 and earlier rear outer
axle, so it would be just as easy to get some early drums ('67 earlier)  and
re-drill them to match the discs.  Does anyone know if this is true?  I
respect this guy, but he has sent me in the wrong direction a few times
before...   TIA!
