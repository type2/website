Subject: Cab Roof panels--cab divider
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey guys---
I've got some cab roof panels from WW just about in my '59.  they need to go 
just an inch further on the middle corners and will be ready for screws, but, 
they aren't budging a bit??? I've worked for an hour to no avail?? any tips??

BTW---I've asked before, but, what size and type of fastener do cab dividers 
use???
I need to get some to mount it up this weekend!!!!

Thanks--Pete
'59 panel
'74 super vert
