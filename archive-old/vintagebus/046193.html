 Sorry, but I can't help but be skeptical of reports of &quot;I've found the 
rarest bus on
 the face of the earth&quot; coupled with &quot;I'm not going to take any pictures of 
it, if you
 want to see it I might take it to a show in washington&quot;
 
 While I believe in the possibilty of extraterrestrial life, and barndoor 
binz buses,
 I still need to see one to believe it. &gt;&gt;

Or at least the Binz serial number??
