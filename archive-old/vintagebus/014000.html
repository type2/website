Subject: [VB] **Roof rack suction cups needed**
Message-ID: &lt;19991115160921.93647.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I purchased a roof rack this weekend that has 10 suction cup type feet on 
it. The cups screw on and are about 3&quot; across where the meet the roof. Has 
anyone ever seen this style or know where I can get some of the cups ? I 
should have a picture of it soon, so if you want to see what I am talking 
about, just email me off list.

Thanks,
David
