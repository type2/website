&gt; When working with fumey chemicals for Pete's sake do it somewhere 
&gt; ventilated 
&gt; so you share the fumes with everyone else (dilute dilute)

Hi Volks,
Or try 3M's &quot;Safest Stripper&quot; at your local hardware store.  No dangerous 
fumes and has worked great though works better in cool weather and/or covered 
with plastic wrap overnight to keep from drying out  while it works!
