Subject: RE: Center Pivot Bushing (55 Westy)

&gt; 
&gt; The center pivot bushing for the steering system is *wasted* - wobbles all
&gt; over the place; anyone got the procedure for replacing that handy?
Hey Thom,

This is a composite procedure from Clymer's (crappy book) and Haynes
(1700/1800), InterEurope #138, and my personal experience. None of these
document the procedure very well.

The bushing kit should come with the two piece bushing and a replacement
pin. The bushing is undersized and needs to be reamed _after_
installation. 

1. They both say to remove the tie-rod ends and drag link from the swing
lever... I've never had to do that. I leave them attached to the swing
lever. You may have to detach the steering damper from the swing lever.

2. There's a spring washer under the cap that pushes up on the swing
lever. They say to compress that by placing a clamp from the swing lever
to the bottom of the pivot shaft. This is to prevent damage to the shaft
as the swing lever bolt is removed. I've never had to do this, but next
time I probably will.

3. Loosen the locking tab and remove the bolt from the swing lever.

4  Remove the clamp and take off the swing lever, washers, sealing
rings, etc.

5. Drop the shaft out; it'll probably drop out on your nose, as loose as
you say it is! You may need to push it with the clamp, but I don't
recall needing to do this.

6. They say to remove the zerk fitting on the axle beam before driving
the bushing out. Haynes also says to fabricate a tool to pull the
bushing out through the bottom... use a bolt, large washer on the
bottom, smaller washer and pipe on the top... I'm sure you can
visualize. I've always driven the old bushings out through the top with
a punch and ball peen hammer. Haynes was written for a Bay Window bus,
so it may have to come out the bottom. Clymer doesn't mention taking the
bushing out at all (crappy book). 

7. Press the new bushing in... The bolt/washer tool used to pull it out
would probably be slick for pressing it in. I use a c-clamp to press it
in. I wouldn't beat it with a hammer! Haynes says to leave the top
bushing .05 in (1.27mm) proud above the mounting so the lever will not
rub on the mounting when reassembled. The bottom bushing should be
flush.

The new bushings will have grooves to allow the grease to work down and
up the shaft. These, of course, should open to the inside of the mount
and be closed on the outside (it will be intuitive once you look at it).

8. At this point, only InterEurope mentions reaming the bushings, but
the several I've bought have been undersized. I believe this is to allow
for distortion upon installation. The fit is _critical_! Don't ask me
how I know! :) It should pivot easily by hand without slop. 

Okay, that's pretty vague. The specs in my &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; say to
ream out to 24.00-24.03mm (.9448-.9459in). The pivot shaft specs are
given as 23.98-23.97mm (.9440-.9436in). Wear limit on the bushing is
given as 24.04mm (.9463) and on the shaft 23.95mm (.9429in)... so don't
ream it much. You could buy the correct machinist's reamer for this... I
use an adjustable reamer. I start undersized and very, very gradually
ease it out until I get the fit I want.

9. Clean it all up and reassemble (DUH!). Get all the reamings out,
replace the zerk fitting. I prepack it with grease, but that's probably
anal. You probably have books with the exploded drawings of how things
go back together... if not, I can copy something for you. 

The books recommend clamping the swing lever back on the top of the pin
to compress the thrust washer before installing the lock bolt. Torque
the lock bolt to 47-54 ft. lbs. I don't see a torque in &quot;Without
Guesswork&quot;.

Reattach the steering damper and anything else that was removed from the
swing lever. 

10. Squirt lots of grease in there. To the list... grease this stuff
_regularly_ and it will last a long time. Grease the king pins and link
pins while your at it (and adjust them).

I hope this isn't too long but that I didn't leave anything out. I hang
onto the old bushings... they make great ferrules when making new
handles for woodworking chisels and lathe tools!
