Subject: 60 Pickup FS - Boston area

Hi all,
	 I saw an ad in the Boston Globe, under classic cars, and 
thought someone may be interested. Here is what I got from Steve 
Serio at Aston Martin of NE in Brighton, MA. I have no interest ( 
wish I did ) past passing this onto the list.

1960 VW Transporter Pickup Truck. Completely restored, 32000 miles, like new.
Red with grey interior.
	You can go to the web site, astonmartin-lotus_dot_com  and email 
them or call 617 - 783 - 1800.
I have had no dealings with them, little out of my price range, but 
their web site does show a number Porsche 356's.
	Mike - 67 Deluxe
