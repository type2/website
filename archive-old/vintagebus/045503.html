&lt;&lt; BTW, I saw shift extensions _at_ the OCTO meet for $50!  Didn't bother
 to check to see if they were original or repro. &gt;&gt;

Still have the shifter extensions available for $25 to your (US) door step.  
BTW, Erin aka No Quarter polished some of these up while he was down here.  
You can own a limited edition NQ polished extension if you act today!  8-)
