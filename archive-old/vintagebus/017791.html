&lt;I just moved into this house, and most of my free time has been
spent getting the garage ready to work on the '54.  Most of my
household stuff isn't even unpacked yet!&gt;





All I can say is you are definitely NOT married Thom.  You guys are all killing me with these monstrous warehouses sitting out on a farm somewhere.  Boy am I jealous.

  My little detached 2 car is stuffed to the brim with one rockerless stripped '65 pop top Westy and all its parts sitting inside it and on shelves everywhere.  A 60 gallon compressor, small corner bench, mig and gas welders, blast cabinet and for some reason a broken window air conditioner sitting on the floor seem to fill up every inch.  I just bought a Price Club canopy for my 62 double cab but the astro and Jetta sit out in the front.

I'm currently building a shed out behind the garage, but VW parts are banned since I've commandeered the entire garage :-)
