(about Solvang)
&gt; George,
&gt; You're forgetting the best cookies in the world and great bread.
&gt; I used to do a 100 mile bike ride every year that started and ended in
&gt; Solvang, couldn't get enough of those cookies after the ride &lt;G&gt;

Yep, the cookies and bread are pretty good, have to give 'em that!

Another good bakery stop is in Bishop, CA.  Schat's (yep, the name is
Dutch) bakery is an institution there and does a booming tourist
business.  Their Chili-Cheese bread is to die for.

&gt; Also, used to live in Morro Bay and always made up reasons to get down
&gt; there just to buy bread and cookies.

Morro Bay!  We're heading up thataway soon to visit our inlaws in
Atascadero.  Nice country, lotsa buses.
