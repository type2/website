Thom,
   I have been working on bus and bugs for about seven years now and am very 
confidant with my mechanical skills when it comes to engines and the like. I 
drove and maintained my friends bus for well over three years before he 
wrecked it even though I have never driven my own, I am not talking anything 
extreme here but, I would like a little more power than the stock config 
allows in terms of horsepower and torque. I am planning to take this thing 
through some serious mountain terrain with quite a load in it (enough for a 
least a month on the road, no hotels because I am poor) and was wondering if 
you think that a single carbed 1835 built right would be a reasonable 
configuation. I would like to run an external 72 plate mesa cooler with a 
fan and thermostat to keep things cool just in case. I really have no probs 
with a 1600, but a little more would really help out on the ardious path I 
have chosen to take and I would really appreciate your input. My dad holds 
you in the highest esteem and I trust your experiance. I am with you in the 
idea that rgbs should be kept, they wouldn't have put them ther if you 
didn't need em, right? Thanks for your help!
