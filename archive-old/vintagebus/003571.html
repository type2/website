Hi all!

With no little amount of joyosity I must needs report an addition to my
family:  It is a '60 Crewcab that I've named Bartholomew, and I'm very
happy.  There's only one serious problem so far....I'll make another post
for that...

I answered an ad on thesamba_dot_com for said crewcab.....asked for pics (of
course) and then went crazy when I saw them.  I took a Greyhound to Santa
Barbara, and came home with a new friend.

While I was in Santa Barbara, I was able to stop by the domicile of Robert
Davis and clan, and not only did I meet a really nice guy who was very
helpful in my determining the value of my DC, but I got to see his
impeccable work in the flesh....or wood and paint, rather....His '58 Westie
is indeed something to ogle!  Thanks, Robert, for your help!

I had an eventful ride home (490 miles...the long way), but Bartholomew did
great.  I was very tired from only getting 2-3 hrs of sleep on the Greyhound
and then 1-2 hrs the night before last, so I did not post right away, as I
wanted to put up this webpage first:
www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Bartholomew.htm

There's still more info I would relate, but it's bedtime again.  (already)

Later!
