&gt; Greetings all from sunny So Cal. I was thinking (That can be dangerous) 
&gt; since the OCTO/Classic weekend is upon us and alot of us here on the list 
&gt; will be in town for it(OK I live here)that possibly Saturday night we could 
&gt; pick a place and all meet up and have a lil grindage (food and drink) and 
&gt; meet one another? Anyone Game?
&gt; 
&gt; 

Bob,

I'm game.  I am planning on doing the VTO fri. campout in Yucaipa, then 
heading to the OCTO show. I wasnt super thrilled with the Irvine Lake campout so I 
may skip out on that and maybe head to the beach to camp with my girls.

I usually skip out on the Classic, but may do it this year to see an old 
friend from SLC if he comes down.
