Thanks to all those who pointed out the point on the top of my head.
The headlight relay is indeed separate and is the cause of my woes.  My
turn signal switch is known to be iffy anyhow and replacement 67 TS
switches are hard to come by.  THat's what I get for asking before
looking at the wiring diagram first!
