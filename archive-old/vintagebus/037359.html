I'll throw in a couple, Litchfield is a nice one although I have never been, I
hear it is the place to be in June on the east coast. Went to Molassess last
may, you can do alright selling stuff here, but there are alot of water cooled
cars. And I heard that the show in New Jersey at ATCO raceway was another good
show. My brother went to the show in Columbus Ohio lasy July and said it was
real nice. I don't know the exact dates, check your local Hot VW's!!
