Subject: OCTO review

Well, another great OCTO main event.  More busses than last year and
another complete row of swappers.  Matthew Henricks was débuting his 4
year resto '65 Sealing wax red / beige gray deluxe, so I headed down to
his house to help him install the westy rack.  It was cool to finally
see it driving and looking awesome. We arrived and entered.  Matt was
pointed to a slot on the front row and I got put on the next row back
with all the other commoners ;-)

I guess at least 20-25 listies were there.  Great to meet many I never
had.  Finally met Erin (NQ) when he came up to Matt and I who were
hanging at the deluxe.  Hard to miss Erin if you've never met him.  Just
look for the train hat and overalls :-)  and Rob (now with hoops for his
single... way to go Rob).   Those guys are hard core!  I think they win
the iron butt award!!  Tom Buese is no slouch either, as he drove his DC
all the way from Utah.  He and I did a double take while passing each
other in the swap...one of those hey I know you looks.  Good to see him
even though he was sans the other two musketeers. Rex Rogers was there
also and its nice to connect a face with a website.  Of course Ronnie
and all the others that are always there with out fail!   What's up with
the beards?  Lots of beard sporting list members....is that a trend? ;-)

Lots to see and buy.  Creative Engineering was there (very nice husband
and wife team)with lots of stuff...except the bits I needed.  I did find
a good set of cargo doors (only needing the smallest lip of metal to
replace at the bottoms where the rubber goes) to help the camper along
and an NOS VW rear wheel bearing repair kit (with the slip
bushing,seal,o-ring and gaskets)...just need one more.  That's about it
for me I'm sure many others got some thing they needed.  I won some Izzy
mirror arms and a T shirt in the raffel...whooo hoo ;-\  Met Chuck M.
again and had a great talk as we have mutual acquaintances.  I also
bought his recent find from him.  Anyone know the break down on  bay
window tent  poles??  How many...how to erect?

MIA were Robert Davis and his camper...too bad, campers were featured.
Thom, and Dave Gillingham.  Dave, both Karl and I had seats for you,
hope all is well.

It was warm, but clear...great day and show.   I most likely won't make
it to the Classic...family duties :-(

Steve
