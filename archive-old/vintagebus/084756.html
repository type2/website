Arnaud,

Your main jet sounds a little small to me.  Try uping it to a 135.

That's what I did on an engine like yours...and best of all, adjusted the 
valves.  My temps went down 15 degrees at the top end from one day to the 
next(same temps, same test).

Try it and see!

And, where does your advance end up at higher RPM's...correctly for full 
advance?

Also, what about your vacuum at idle...what range?...in other words, any 
intake leaks?(running too lean).

Cheers, dave

&gt; Aircoolers,
&gt; I can turn on the oil temp light (the oil reaches 227 degrees) after
&gt; driving 4 miles uphill floored at 60mph when the engine is warm at the
&gt; bottom. It is a pretty serious hill and when I do the test I pass the
&gt; big rigs which climb at about 45mph loaded.
