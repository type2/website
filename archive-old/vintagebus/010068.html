I converted my single cab to 12 volts and am hooking up the rear tail lights
when I notice one is a lot brighter than the other. It turns out I had stuck
in an 1156 bulb instead of an 1157. My question is, is it okay to run with
two 1156's to get the extra brightness, or will it melt  my cheapo plastic
repo lens into stalactites?
