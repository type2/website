&gt; Wow thats a lot.  but the only sizes listed are for the 50.5mm  oversize 
&gt; diameter.
&gt; Can anybody make sense of that?

Hi Andy,
That is the oversized hub for engine cases damaged where the pulley slides in 
and thusly the case is machined to a bigger diameter and then requires the 
oversized pulley hub to keep the engine oil from leaking out there due to 
internal air pressure inside the case.
