Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Oil leak from nosecone

I have been checking the oil regularly, I haven't actually had to put that much in though.

I am careful about this after wrecking my previous gearbox due to a leak input shaft seal and I want to get the parts ready for next months engine change - I want to fix this at the same time
