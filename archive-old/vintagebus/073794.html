Subject: Re: [VB] Brakes revisited

The *percieved* increased stopping power is probably due to the freshly 
adjusted brakes. The stopping power of a brake system comes from the 
pressure created in the master cylinder by your foot pushing on the 
pedal. The pressure is measured in pounds/square inch (or force/unit 
area, to make it universal). If you increase the area, you also have to 
increase the force to keep the force/unit area number the same as it was 
before. A 24mm cylinder has a greater area (3.14 x 24mm^2)/4 than a 22mm 
cylinder (3.14 x 22mm^2)/4, therefore the force you apply to the pedal 
to get the same pressure in the brake system with a 24mm cylinder is 
greater than the force you must apply with a 22mm cylinder. That is why 
I just bought a real '67 master cylinder to put in my bus to replace the 
72-79 that's in there now.

If you have the leg muscle to go with the later cylinder it's an OK 
choice. I've decided that I would rather spend the extra money and get 
the maximum braking power I can. The later cylinder is really meant to 
be used with a power assisted brake system.

I'm not trying to pick on you Ray, I just want people who are making 
choices about their brakes to understand the math.

&gt; Also, for those looking for another 67 MC to replace their worn out one, I
&gt; saved about $120 and bought a $49 72-79 bus MC and the adapter plate. My
&gt; resivior was fragile and I broke a nipple off so replaced it with a wrecking
&gt; yard one off of a 79 Rabbit for $5. The stopping power of the 24mm MC over the
&gt; old 22mm NC is quite noticeable.
