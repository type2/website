Subject: Josh Rodgers and details of death (Ponca City News)

&gt;I didnt' see this posted on the vintagebus list...
&gt;
&gt;Yikes, that casts a new light to think that his bus might have been the tool
&gt;he used?

I didn't think this needed to be posted.  Why let a short dark moment in a
person's lifetime overshadow, or diminish his contributions and
accomplishments.  I want to remember the good times with Josh.
