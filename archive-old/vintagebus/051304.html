&gt; Is there another exaust that is recomended?

Hi Jason,
Yes!  A nice 1300-1600cc muffler for bus.  You will not get the monoxide 
poisoning behind your bus like you will with the bug muffler or most 
extractor mufflers.  Also will run cooler, more torque which is most 
important for a bus and MPG than with the extractor.
