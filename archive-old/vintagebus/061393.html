Subject: Who knows about Sac's Bug-O-Rama?

Quick question for the list.
My folks and I were interested in attending the Labor
Day show this year.  Problem is, I don't know if it's
on Sunday or Monday or both.  Also, I need to know
what time it starts and how long.  Anyone on the list
have the sweet stuff.  Thanks for the answer.
