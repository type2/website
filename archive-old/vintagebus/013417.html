I have noticed that the messages I am sending to the list are showing up days after I sent them.  Anyone else have this problem?

Bus Content:  I have heard of a couple of friends lately who have found NOS 16&quot; rims that were dated in the late fifties.  Are these replacement rims built later or are they something else?

Thanks,
Richard
