&gt; I'm currently in the market for a rebuilt 1600 engine.  I live in Norhern

&gt; have also heard not to-

stay away from GEX. do a search in the type2_dot_com archives for lots of
information on this. 

but might I suggest another solution. get a new mexican 1600
longblock. I have one in my 66 and LOVE it. all new and it runs great.
plus when it comes time for a rebuild. I know that the case should
only have whatever abuse I put into it :)

both ronnie at oldvolks and john at aircooled carry these. both good
volks to deal with. good luck.
