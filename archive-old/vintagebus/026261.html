&gt;But im curious, didnt VW change the part numbering system pst barndoor, i/e
if it was a part for a barndoor as he claims the PN wouldnt be in the 9
digit format?
&gt;
Interesting question, all of the parts that I know are original on my '55
Barndoor Kombi and that have a part # stamped on them do have a 29A part #. 
I don't profess to having disassembled it with an eye toward that
information, however.

This does not include parts 'borrowed' from the Beetle or parts with their
own unique id like the engine, tranny, etc..

My '58 parts manual shows all the parts as 9-digit but perhaps because
that's for replacement and it's later...  I've noticed some of the diagrams
are numbered wrong in the book, too.  ;(
