&gt;Check the turn signal switch.

Before I layed the bus up I was having problems with turnsig switch not 
staying in the left position.  I have now lubed it with dielectric grease, 
and the switch itself is shiny and the springs look like new.
Is there something inside the switch that could be causeing this? Because it 
still looks like new on outside of switch.

Do not us antiseize for wiring you should use dielectric grease.

I was careful with the anti-seize I used a toothpick to insert the stuff in 
each terminal because it is a conductor.
