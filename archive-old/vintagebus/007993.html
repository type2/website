Reminder to Rick, be careful not to offend here!.

There is little doubt that the Bus was the first successful van.  But let me
share with you a little known fact. Curtis Brubaker was friendly with Lee
Iaccoca (sp?). They had shared their ideas including the Brubaker Box. When
Curtis was trying to develop the marketing of his new car (based upon the
type I chassis) he had lots of print material developed. There was a poster
of the Box in this marketing package. One of those posters found it's way
onto Lee Iaccoca's office wall where it remained for a few years prior to
the release of the first Caravan. If you can make the leap (not to tough) to
the assumption that the Brubaker Box was the seed (or part of) for the
Caravan, then we can also thank Volkswagen for the Caravan. For without the
Beetle chassis as a motivating factor for Curtis Brubaker then there would
not have been a Brubaker Box.

Here is another bit of trivia for your consideration. Volkswagen was offered
the Brubaker to develop into their line up. Volkswagen turned down the idea
on the basis that if the consumer were offered a Bus and a Box side by side
they would have chosen the Box. This may or may not be true but Volkswagen
was sufficiently frightened for their Bus sales to turn down the project.

I just thought that since the subject did come up that someone might be
interested. Now of the 53 cars that were produced we have confirmed the
existence of 5. Would you all please keep an eye out for the rest. I'd like
to know where they are.

&gt; The popular opinion seems to be that Chrysler invented the minivan in
&gt; 1984.  But we VW Bus owners know better - Volkswagen invented it in
&gt; 1949!  Or did they?
&gt;
&gt; I present for your amusement the *1936* Stout-Scarab.
