Subject: '67 brake line  position Q (retry)

Sorry about the last message, I hope the line art comes through now.

I'm trying to finish installing a '67 brake system in my '65 after too
many near misses with no brakes.  I went the route of getting a '67-only
brake line kit.  I'm down to the last line- the front passenger side.
   Its not routed anything like my '65.  Its alot shorter- 957mm.  I'm
wondering where it runs to get to the 'T'.  I did some line art below.
   (What I'm calling the 'bulkhead' is the piece that goes sidewas across
the bottom of the bus right rearward of the M/C).   Does the '67 brake
line cut across behind the 'bulkhead' and poke out through it closer to
the master cylinder.
