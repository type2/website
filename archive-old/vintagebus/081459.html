Subject: The Home Stretch

So ... woe is me (is that spelled right - I never know.)  Anyhow - I'm been 
trying to get the old fella to the body shop since ... November maybe.  The 
body guy said he was going to come and get it ... but he was just blowing 
smoke up my skirt.  I called my good friends at CAA last Saturday and asked 
who the local tow guy is - I know there is one but he isn't in the book - he 
has the CAA contract and just tows for them.  They asked 'why do you need 
that' .. well, because I need to have a vehicle towed.  Are you a member - 
yes.  Are you with the vehicle - yes.  Is it going to a garage - yes.  We 
will move it for you.  But wait - this vehicle isn't licensed or insured for 
driving - only insured for sitting - no problem - we'll move it - just call 
us.  Wow - that's great.

So I call yesterday - OK - come and get it - is it licensed - no - well we 
can't tow it - but g*d d*mn it - you told me last week you would - if I had 
known - and I did specifically ask and tell you it wasn't licensed, I would 
have made other arrangements - it is Sunday! - Sorry - we can't help!

Anyway - so they sent a truck that I would have to pay for - can I speak to 
the guy first - I would just like to confirm the price before he drives all 
the way out here.  No - sorry - we'll just send him out.

Guy turned out to be a very nice guy - says - wow - what a nice van - excuse 
me kind sir - its actually a bus :)  I don't want to tow your &quot;bus&quot; ... 
because I would have to tow it from behind and the steering wheel won't 
lock - d*mn.  But if I were to tow it it would be $60.0 to hook up plus 
miles - hey wait - I recently had this ol' white fella towed from Kingston 
for $90.00 - your not going to charge me that much to tow this 1/3 as far - 
no - I'm not going to tow it at all.

But ... I do have a float ... and I can have my guy come back tomorrow first 
thing in the a.m. and we can move it for you on the float - for a straight 
$60.00 - wow - that's great - lets do that then.  OK.

So ... still don't have the front windows in - I have to repaint the swoosh 
that I scratched trying to cut the rubber - I now am using rubber that the 
guys at Standard Auto glass gave me and they told me how to do it such that 
I won't scratch the swoosh again.  The key is ... you put the rubber on the 
glass - this stuff isn't really rubber (sure looks like rubber to me) its 
some kinda of petroleum product .. its kinda sticky ... so you put that on 
the glass ... it sticks to the glass - you cut it at the corner where the 
swoosh goes so that when you press the glass into the frame you still need 
to cut off the excess rubber .. but not behind the swoosh - thing about 
swooshes is .. the old ones are really big as compared to the ones with 
sekurit glass. As well - this fancy new product swells when it gets oil on 
it.  So ... you stick it to the glass - cut the excess off where the swoosh 
goes - coat it with oil - press it into the frame - cut off the excess 
rubber (sorry - petroleum product) - and ... you got er buckwheat.

Also still have my bumpers to do - got em all apart - but the rear one needs 
a little work .. I got a great deal from Mr. Heron on a slash bumper and I'm 
using the over-riders that I had on my rear pointed bumper. I have a bit of 
welding, sandblasting, priming and painting to do - but not much.

So ... the body guy is gonna replace two outriggers - two jack points - the 
front piece that the heat pipe passes through - and about 6&quot; of the heat 
pipe - strip the exterior down to bare metal - prime and paint.

A few pics of the bad boy on the road - I took a couple of pics of Dan 
Ackroyd's 41 Buick but ... strangely .. they weren't on the digi-cam
