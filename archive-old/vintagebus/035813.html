&lt;&lt; Yes, there are probably fewer Binzes than Hebs, yes they may be more rare.
 They are probably less sideloader Single Cabs and ladder trucks and cherry
 pickers too but they are not worth the same as Deluxes... &gt;&gt;

This is of course correct.  All things shiny and colorful like a Heb or a 
deluxe with all its beautiful trim are the first ones to get the attention 
and will probably always be worth top dollar over the other models.  

In regard to the other model of busses, the side loader is way cool &amp; way 
rare and I have completely no idea what they are going for.  I would guess it 
*should* be a lot more than a regular single cab.  I have seen a ladder truck 
and don't remember them being a whole lot more than a single cab with some 
machinery bolted to the back end, of course that has been several years ago 
and I didn't inspect it.  While ladder trucks are rare I'm not sure if it is 
different enough to warrant a huge premium but should still be way more than 
a regular single cab.  Just my opinion of course.
