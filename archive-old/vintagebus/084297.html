Subject: Today's fun - workin' on the bus (cont)

I had today off from both jobs and was so tired last night after working 
20 hours on 3 hours sleep I was asleep by 11.  Woke at 8 today, ate a 
bag-lady (bagel) and went into town for supplies - scrapers, hardware, 
paint brushes and stuff,  got home about the time the fog burned off 
(11) and started in.

Lit the portable wood stove to dry cleaned parts and to get rid of 
grease soaked paper towels and such.  Found the best heater boxes in the 
pile and started reassembly.  Things went together pretty well except of 
course the muffler.  I had bought a new one from Advance (made in Brazil 
for Walker) and neither the left manifold or the right intake manifold 
heater thingy were even close.  I bent things close for the exhaust 
manifold and then cranked hard on the preheater dealy enough to get the 
hold down bolts started.

After that things went fairly quickly, painted the fan shroud, the 
combustion cleaning system worked phenomenally, I just had to take a 
brush and get the ash and crap out, tossed it in the creek to flush the 
rest out (no hydrocarbons left a sheen) and tossed it on the portable 
wood stove to dry.  Once dry I dug up a can of black spray paint and 
after wire brushing the rusty spots gave it a high quality flat high 
temperature paint job, guaranteed to last all the way to the end of the 
driveway.  Installed the tinware, wire tying the many places where the 
tabs for the screws no longer cared to take a thread.  I didn't sweat it 
too much because the engine's on a trial basis for now anyhow and I'll 
just go dig through the local VW boneyard for some better tin in the 
near future.  About that time (3:20) I realized I was really hungry and 
that I now needed help to reinstall the engine.  I went into the house, 
made a sammige and just in time Alex came home from school.  He made a 
snack then Alex, Crazy Auntie Sherry and I went out to the barn to 
install the beastie.  Off the stand it came slicker than dog snot on a 
frozen sidewalk, onto the milk crates with waiting support board.  
Unbolt the adapter for the stand run the jack under the support board 
and off to the bus we go.  This wasn't the easiest installation we've 
done but it still went pretty well.  Got stuck for a little while until 
we found the flashlight so I could see that the tranny and engine 
weren't on the same plane.

It's now bolted in, wires hooked up, fuel lines almost completely run 
except for deciding where to put the filter (supply side of the fuel 
pump of course).  Put a set of ignition wires on it, reinstall the rear 
valance, put in some petrol and let's see if she starts.  My goal is to 
drive it to work tomorrow evening.  

Keep your fingers crossed.
