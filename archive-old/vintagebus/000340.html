Hi Tim,
Actually they make alot more money selling the spare parts than selling the 
new cars.  We heard of someone who got access to the VW spare parts computer 
system and inquired on all the parts to NOS his late model bus except for the 
body.  Came up with a figure of about $3,000,000!   Eric&amp;Barb
