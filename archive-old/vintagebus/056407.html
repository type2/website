Subject: Re: [VB] shifter spins..why?

Just got back from climbing under my bus to make sure, but there is supposed
to be a pin like on the early bugs that keeps the whole shifter from
rotating.  The shifters in the early bus has a crook in it, and if it didn't
the crook would turn around.  Now if you're talking about the extension
itself, it is supposed to have a jam nut that keeps it from turning.

Later

Subject: [VB] shifter spins..why?


&gt; I ordered a shift extension and put that bad boy on, it was great until I
&gt; realized the entire shifter spins and sometimes twsits the extension all
the
&gt; way around. Makes for a unique and undetermined shift pattern,  Is there a
&gt; way to get the shifter to keep from spinning???
