&gt;There was a post yesterday, 4/19, referencing some transaxle/transmission 
&gt;documentation complete with pictures.  Unfortunately I lost the link and
&gt;the note and have not been able to search it out.

For recent stuff, the last 1000 posts to VintageBus are always available
at http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect .  Then there's the archives
at http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/search-vintagebus.html .  There is a
similar last-1000-posts cache for the Type2 list as well.

Soon (like when I get a round tuit) the list messages will automagically
get added to the archives every night, so the archive will be at most
one day behind.  It's just that lately I have been working on the doc
project and doing other stuff that comes with having a life.  :)
