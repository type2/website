... it must be a Florida thing.

I am having a very similar problem with my '67.  Sometimes when I start the
bus nothing happens.  I would wiggle the wires and it would work just fine.
I have also noted that when I turn on the headlights, the car would miss fr
a second and then be OK.  It will also die when I am at an intersection for
no reason, but start up (my thoughts were either electrical connections, a
bum ignition switch or a fuel filter problem).

This AM nothing happened when I turned the key and for once it didnt start
when i jiggled the wires.  I would up driving the Areost*r to work; bummer.

I was planning to clean all the electrical connections this weekend (emory
board, steel wool, etc).  I suspect things will be alot happier when I
scrape 33 years of crud off of the connections.

&gt; &gt;the light switch and the lights came on as normal then died all of a

&gt; &gt;dash lights, clicks or anything.

&gt; Tom,
&gt;
&gt; A few years ago I had a similar problem with my '59 single cab.  If I
&gt; wiggled the wires to the switch under the dash, it would start right up.
&gt;
&gt; The power from your battery goes to the headlight switch first and from
&gt; the headlight switch to your ignition switch.  The early buses have
&gt; screw terminals on the switches instead of push on terminals.
&gt;
&gt; The problem I had was the wire to the headlight switch was a little
&gt; loose.  try pulling your headlight switch, cleaning the wire ends and
&gt; putting the wires back in the switch, making sure the screw terminals
&gt; are nice and tight.  See if that cures your problem.
