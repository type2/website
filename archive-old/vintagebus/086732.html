Hey Guys    You weren't trying to put a 6 volt pulley on  were you? they are 
different and won't line up. I use the porsche 356,912  pulleys  they are 
kinda costly but as Tedebare said are stronger and help  cool better. Also belt 
should be a 15355 for stock pulley and 15345 for porsche  pulley. I have seen so 
many of these pulleys break it is unreal, chrome ones are  the worse, bronze 
color one just as bad,  black brazil ones seem to be  working good and black 
german ones are the best but are getting real hard to  find  later  Mark D
