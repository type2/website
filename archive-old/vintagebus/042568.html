Subject: wallered out drum :( anyone gots?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10006140912270.20353-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

Well, it sucks.  I ruined a perfectly good small nut rear drum, i dont
think it had ever been turned...

I didnt get all the gear oil off the drum/nut mating surface, so the nut
loosened up, i didnt notice this, and now my drivers side rear drum is
wallered out. i have it tightened down good again, but how much damage can
the drum being able to move on the splines do? (i/e the drum is now gone,
but can i ruin the stub axle?)

Anyhow, i find myself in need of a good used rear drum ,wolfsburg west has
new now, which is good... but they are expensive which is bad...

Anyone have a nice used one i could buy... i'd even buy a whole small nut
tranny for spares... bad tranny okay... just so long as the drums are
good.

Also the outer bearing on that side is bad, im hoping to take care of the
bearing and the drum at the same time to save me having to take it apart
twice... but its easy so thats not a biggy.

thanks a lot,

Steve

p.s. im in saint louis MO.
