This is the reason I don't add links to my site any more - every yahoo
with an AOL disk was creating a VW vanity page and crying &quot;link me!&quot;
only to disappear 100 hours later.

I started working on, but never finished, a perl script to dynamically
manage a links page by validating them at regular intervals.  I am
a firm beleiver in the &quot;set-and-forget&quot; site maintentance model.

&gt; 
&gt; 670k of VW links.  (looks like some of them are a bit out-dated though...)
