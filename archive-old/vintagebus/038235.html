Subject: RE: westy pop top
Date: Mon, 9 Nov 1998 12:20:20 -0800 

I guess I should have been more COUNTRY specific when I made that statement.
Sometimes I get a little narrow sighted and think the world revolves around
the US market only. My BAD :-(
Yes I too have seen the Westy conversions for the small pop-up-top in
Baywindow busses as noted by Todd, but the chance of an actual small westy
top baywindow conversion being in the US is scarce, compared to the sheer
number of small pop-top conversions done by other camper conversion
manufacturers here in the US.
The only way to be sure is to see photos of the pop-top and it's
installation in the bus. Which, of course is a mute point cause it is in a
junk bus and probably soon to be crushed by a car crusher.
Nuff said, I clarify my previous statement. And thank Todd for reminding me.

P.S. Todd could you share the Westy lit with the rest of the vintage bus
class? scans or something, it would be nice to see.

&gt; just a correction...but yes Westfalia did make this small top
&gt; `68-`79...just not for the US
&gt; market...I have copies of actuall westfalia lit. showing this option along
&gt; with
&gt; the dormobile top too on `68-`79 westys....

&gt; &gt; Hi Chuck,
&gt; &gt; No, Westfalia did not install the small pop-up-tops in 68 and later
&gt; busses.
