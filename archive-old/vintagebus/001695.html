Subject: help pricing '61 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;00065F7E.3229_at_santafe.cc.fl_dot_us&gt;
Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

     Hi all, a local college student here in my town called me with a
     request for help.  He has a '61 Westy that he MUST sell soon as he is
     moving to D.C. and unable to take it with him and won't need a car
     where he's going and needs the money.  He wants to know a reasonable
     price to ask and I am unable to make a decent guess, not having been
     interested in the market, other than parts, for a long time.  Can
     anyone help?

     '61 Westy, daily driver, 6 volt 1200 motor, Dove Blue, complete SO34
     interior with complete side tent and child's cot, needs minor body
     work.

     That's all I know and I understand it is sketchy and none of you have
     seen or heard it but can anyone make a guess?  I have no interest in
     this myself, just trying to help the boy out.  I do NOT need another
     vehicle in my yard.

     Thanks
     Ray
     Gainesville, FL
