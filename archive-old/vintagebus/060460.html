Hi
We are flying over to USA for a holiday on July 14th. We are flying in =
to Denver (I know I know..) and renting a mobile hotel (RV) for three =
weeks. We know we want to head up to Yellowstone but thats all!
Can anyone offer help or advice on things worth checking out bearing in =
mind we don't want to do 15 parks in 10 days kind of trip.=20
As some of you may know I edit VW Camper and Commercial mag (check out =
www.volkswagencamper.co_dot_uk) and have a book just out all about the =
history and specs of the Split Bus and its many varieties (some nice US =
stuff and info in it as well). So are ther any diehard VW Bus nuts out =
thataways we may get chance to say hi and maybe have cold beer?
Hoping some of you can suggest stuff to make our trip even more =
memorable. Thanks in advance.=20
Email us direct at David_at_worldwidesplits_dot_com as Dan is posting this up =
for us! hoping to hear :)
