Subject: New VW Club in Pittsburgh
Message-ID: &lt;370A52BA.39E4_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I wanted to let everybody know about a new VW group
forming in the Pittsburgh area.  Our first meeting is going to be at the
Donut Connection right off the Carnegie exit of 279 on April 11, that's
this coming sunday.  We're getting together around 4:00pm.
        As far as directions:  Coming from Pgh, West on the parkway
(279) to the Carnegie exit (1 3/4 miles past Greentree).  Once on the
exit ramp, follow the signs for Carnegie and stay in the left lane.  At
the first light turn left, this will bring you to another light at the
intersection with Main St. (large BP station will be on the right).
Turn left onto Main St., and roughly 1 block on the right is the lot for
the Donut Connection.  If you are driving in on 79, exit onto the
parkway(279) towards Pgh and take the Carnegie exit.  You need to turn
right to get to the intersection with Main St., then turn right onto
Main St.
        We're trying to get air cooled VW owners organized for get
togethers, caravaning to shows, swapping parts and information, tech
seminars and general VW comaraderie.  Get a hold of me or Frank if your
interested, need more detailed directions, more information or for just
whatever.  Hope to see you there!

Sincerely,
Aaron Badertscher
