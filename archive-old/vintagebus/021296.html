&lt;&lt; what motor came stock for a '67 deluxe? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
For USA market 1964-67 stock it would have been a SP 1500.  Some countries 
overseas you could get the SP 1600 stock as early as 64.  There apparently 
was a way in the USA to special order or have your VW dealer upgrade to SP 
1600.  We have found two 1600 chrome scripts to be mounted above the bus 
licence light on the engine lid, with exactly the same spacing and font as 
the 1963 1500 bus engine lid script.   Eric&amp;Barb
