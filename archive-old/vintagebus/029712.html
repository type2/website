Anyone see that '53 Barndoor Kombi in Hot VWs this month?  It said in the
article that that white pinstiping was factory-correct.  Is this true? 
I've never noticed a pinstriping line on the original paint Kombis I've
seen.  On Standards and Deluxes, yes.

My wife thought the stripe looked &quot;lame&quot;.  :)
