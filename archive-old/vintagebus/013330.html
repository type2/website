hey dudes,
right now i own a '72 westy, but i'm looking for something alittle cooler, 
in my eyes anyways. and in the town i live in there are only 3 pre 67's that 
i know about, and one of them is for sale. what i'm looking to see is if 
this guy wants too much for it, that's why i'm asking you the experts.

specs:
-straight body
-new paint
-safari windows
-zero rust
-no transmissioin
-intact engine
-no interior
-been sitting for a year
-he is asking 4500 canadian.
too much or good buy??

thanks dudes
kenny  '72 custom westy a.k.a. &quot;white lightning&quot;
