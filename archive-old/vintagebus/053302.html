Subject: Re: [VB] westfalia curtin rods

i did the mental math and came up with 8- one for each of the six window =
and and two for the back window. as menioned westy's came with an =
(optional?) cab divider curtain rod that follows the curved profile of the =
cab. you tend to see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they =
got to so 42's they petered out

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;John Baker&quot; &lt;jbakerccymca_at_springmail_dot_com&gt; 12/10/01 12:25PM &gt;&gt;&gt;
On the 64 Westy I just sold there were 8.  One on top of each of the 6 =
pop-outs and one for the top AND the bottom of the rear hatch window.  =
This Westy also had a Ninth rod that hung between the cab and the rear =
passenger area.
Peace, John B
