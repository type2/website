&gt; I got some pictures of the '57 Single-Cab I've got for sale up on the
web.
&gt; You can get there from a link on my site or go directly to:
&gt; 
&gt; http://members.xoom_dot_com/_XOOM/type2guy/57.html
&gt; 
&gt; BEWARE: lots of pictures resulting in slow loading. I thought it'd be
&gt; alright so people can get a good idea of the condition of the truck.
Just
&gt; go grab a drink (or a smoke, or your wife, or whatever turns you on)
while
&gt; you let the pages load.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know how much to ask. Email me what you think it's worth. I'd
like
&gt; to hear from people who even arent' gonna buy so I can get an idea of
&gt; value. I'm trying to find out what would be a fair price so I can
drop down
&gt; a little from that to make it a good deal for someone.
&gt; 
&gt; Take it easy!
