Subject: Re: Steering Wheel Removal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Assuming you asked because you are trying to remove a
steering wheel, try this:

1. Spray the nut with a loosener
2. Untighten nut until it is flush with the top of the
threads.
3. While pushing up on the wheel, have a second person
whack the nut with a hammer.
You can use you left knee (put your foot on the
headlight bucket) to push on the left and your right
arm to push on the right. If necessary this leaves
your left hand for the hammer.
I know this sounds unorthodox, but I have used it
several times on wheels I thought I would never get
off. Takes a few whacks, but always worked for me!

Enjoy your day!
