Whos gonna vouch that my 55 never came with front or rear bumpers?
Ive heard of that law before.
My old 60 deluxe BUS (bus content) never came with seatbelts, I got a fix it 
ticket for that along with 13 different other things.
NO speedometer
NO ebrake
NO taillights
NO headlights
CRACKED windshield
NO bumpers
NO proof of insurance in car.
NO proof of registration in car.
NO drivers licesne in car
NO seatbelts
NO turnsignals
And a few other things.....
i got EVERYTHING written off but the seatbelts.....judge told me to shut up 
before he put me in jail. After that i paid the 35$ fine and drove away.
Maybe I should have saved this for friday?

&lt;&lt;If your bus was not originally equipped with the bumpers, do you still need
them?  In Maryland, you are within the law if you can prove that your vehicle
did not come originally equipped with said options.
