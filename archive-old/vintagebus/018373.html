Ok, this 1966 bus thing is new to me. I drag the bus down off the car dolly
and it sits askew off my driveway. The back brakes are frozen somehow, so I
crawl under yesterday to back off the star adjustment thingy. #)*&amp;^_at_#%_at_ There
is no adjustment hole. Is it behind the reduction boxes? How does one get out
of this catch 22? 

I also checked the compression on the old engine. 0/20/0/30. Bummer. Well, I
will have to convert to 12V sooner or later anyway. What use is the old motor?
After I get the newer 1600cc (just incase of core charge or something), I will
write and give/trade it to the list.

I explained to my wife the onus she bore as the namer of our new bus. She
adeptly named it &quot;Barnacle Bob&quot; because it looks like it has been on the ocean
floor. All covered with dirt, algae, moss, and the inside has been used for
used superbike parts for ~10 years. 

So, any suggestions on the back brakes?
