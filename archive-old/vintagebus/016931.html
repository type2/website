It's been a long time since I've actively looked at one (I seem to
have good luck in that area).  I'll go check my set of engines later
today to see if I was completely hallucinating.  It may also be that I
had one that'd be done that way as a one-off to cure a problem
(obviously, if there's a washer in there that isn't planned for, you
can tighten down enough to get a seal without going too far into the
case).
