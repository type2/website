............ Peeling
&gt;&gt; paint would look worse than the galvanized coating.
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard (and seen) that paint doesn't stick to galvanized surfaces
&gt; very well.  I have had minimum luck with getting paint to stick to
&gt; galvanized house gutters, for instance.  I think the recommendation is
&gt; to either sand the galvanizing or wash it with some kind of acid or
&gt; detergent first, but please verify this before messing with your wheels.

Galvanizing can be easily painted over but it takes special primer w/ zinc
chromate in it to make it stick.  I wouldn't sand the galvanizing tho as
it's toxic stuff-it's also nasty to weld on anything galvanized. Your best
bet??? is to have the rims de-galvanized by having a plater professionally
do it. Galvanized finishes are rough &amp; not very smooth for a nice painted
finish. It also does not last as long as other rust resistant finishes, such
as cadium, nickle plating or stainless which I use on my tilt hardware.
Powder coating rules, &amp; they sandblast, can use zinc primer before powder
coating to give you a finish that will last a long time, look great, &amp; be
cost effective when you consider all these factors.

IMHO,
