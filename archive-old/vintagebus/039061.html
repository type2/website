Hi all, I'm unsubscribing from the lists for a while.  I've taken a new job
in Colorado Springs, CO and will be moving there this weekend.  I don't know
when I'll get set up for e-mail and internet access, but as soon as I do
I'll re-subscribe to the lists, say &quot;howdy&quot;, and let you all know my new
e-mail address.
