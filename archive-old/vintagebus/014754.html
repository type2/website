Subject: i am not committing idleatry/nashville scene/trip (long)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

my bus is having trouble idling. it idles good for
about the first mile or two, them i have to feather it
the rest of the time. i have adjusted the valves, set
the idle on the carb higher, changed the spark plugs,
wires, cap, and rotor. i don't know what else to do.
it is driveable and all, but very annoying driving
these nashville hills.

speaking of nashville, are there any listees that live
around here? i know i've asked this before, but i lost
those emails when i quit my job back in minneapolis. i
am wondering about places to buy parts mainly. and
maybe a few junkyard hot spots.

if you are wondering about how my trip down went, it
went fairly well. i had one problem in Gary, IN. my
clutch went out as i pulled into a truck stop (luckily
there) i thought that my cable ad loosened, but it
turns out that  a spring popped out of place on the
pressure plate. the guys who fixed it said that it may
pop out again. it hasn't happened yet (knock on wood).
it ended up costing me about 225 bucks altogether.
which was ok. it also delayed my trip about a day.
when i pulled into nashville, i had very, very little
brake pressure. and then, none. i was lost and had to
get to my friends house using the e-brake. i rolled up
at 10:00 or so on the 31st. the next day we bled the
brakes and looked for a leak, but could not find
anything real noticeable. i know it is leaking
somewhere around the master cylinder. and only seems
to leak at high speeds (4th gear). i hardly use 4th
gear here in town, so it has not posted much of a
threat. i just have to keep an eye on the fluid. i
have a bunch of other things to take care of before i
fix this stuff. i just started my new job today and
moved into my new place yesterday. and my MN liscense
is officially expired today, since, it is my 21st
birthday. plus i have no insurance on my bus at this
point.

any input on these issues would help. thanks.
