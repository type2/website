I've got two engines from Butch... had one in my bug for 2 years and 15,000 
miles... another in my bus and 3,000 miles (It's only been going since july).
I'm in Illinois and he has them shipped here (actually my mechanic has bought 
2 for other customers and 1 1641 for himself)... all because Eric and Barb 
recommended him to me.
Butch is a pleasure to deal with!!!!!
Thanks,
Pete
