I also agree!!!!

Staying with the vintage parts is always better than some radio shack
special!!!

That is after all why we like the &quot;vintage&quot; automobiles.  If it is new or
not original....  Go buy a new beetle or some other anonymous vehicle!!!

&gt; &gt;That's true Eric.  But there are ways of having them fixed/rebuilt.  THEN
&gt; &gt;the price goes up when a seller cannot only state they are working but
&gt; &gt;recently rebuilt professionally.
&gt; &gt;More than once I've bought the correct radio (not working) and installed
&gt; &gt;it in the dash.  I prefer that non working one to a radio shack $29.95
&gt; &gt;version working one.
&gt; &gt;half a dozen of one and 6 of the other......
&gt; &gt;:)   later
