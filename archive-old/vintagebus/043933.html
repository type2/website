I've done this type of conversion (6V to 12V) a bunch of times.  As any
other modification, there are always several approaches that produce the
same end result.  Here's my path....
You will have to use a 12 volt generator, which will require a different
generator tower (depending on the motor you will be using).
You will be using a 12V regulator too.  This could be mounted nearby the
generator so that the short wires to it won't have to be changed out.
Normally these run right to the generator, but won't anymore.
Keep track of the wire connections so that they do not become mixed up
during the transfer.
You'll need a 12V coil.
You'll need a 12V choke and while you're in that area, if yours uses a 6V
electromagnetic pilot jet, that'll have to be swapped out for a 12V too.
The flasher unit will have to go to 12V and the hi-lo beam unit is up to
you.  Personally, I've found them to be built with enough overkill that
they will last quite awhile handling the 12V current.  Your call.
Headlights, license light, any side lamps/turn signal, interior, parking,
instrument, warning and tail/brake light bulbs go to 12V too.
If you aren't too particular about how the 12V wiper motor conversion is
done, then here is a light suggestion only.
I have used a 12V wiper motor and the arms that go with it.  I have then
set the motor in place and scribed some marks on the original arms and the
replacement arms where I would be able to cut them both off at.  I then
welded the original arms to the replacement arms and Voila'.  works good.
There are other options available for this to work (voltage drop
included), but I'll leave the other suggestions to the list.
Anyway, about the horn.  Your call, again.  I find that these handle the
12V OK.  They may not last as long as they normally would, but what does
on a VW!
You may want to change the 6V starter solenoid.  Some volks run the 6V
starter.  It shouldn't be cranked on for very long periods.  If the motor
don't start, then figure out why.  It shouldn't be for lack of spinning
over!
Now if you're going to put the 12V flywheel in your 6V bellhousing so you
can run the 12V starter, then this requires a bit more work.
The 12V flywheel is of the 132 tooth count.  You'll have to manually grind
out about 1/10th&quot; of the bellhousing diameter, from the back lip inwards.
and then pruchase a modified starter bushing.  Which is pretty easy to
come by.  The 12V starter armature is smaller than 6V.
Now the real problem with putting on the 12V flywheel to the 6V crankshaft
is that the flywheel opening for the crank is smaller than that of it's 6V
sibling.  It has to be machined larger in order to fit.  Again, better
machine shops can handle it.
Oh yea, don't forget.  Toss the 6V battery!
I know there are other parts and pices that can fit into this puzzle, such
as tranny swaps and or DP motor installs, etc.  But I'm going with the
info you provided.  Convert a 6V Bus to 12V.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;     Alrighty, getting ready to try an electrical overhaul on my '62
&gt; Kombi...tired old 6V bus...and I'm looking for a bit o' advice about the whole
&gt; thing.  What happened when you did this?  What did you wish you had but didn't
