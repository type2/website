&lt;&lt; I have this gizmo  that looks like a flasher that is wired up near the 
 starter what is this? &gt;&gt;
Hi VWbus58,
It is a starter solinoid relay.  Volks install this as a quicky fix when the 
solinoid does not get enough voltage to work properly.  Which means all too 
often that the dirty connections in the wiring are left ot get worse and slow 
wipers, dim headlights, and cause turn signals to slow and dim!  Remove this 
relay/crutch and clean/fix up your wiring to work properly.    Eric&amp;Barb
