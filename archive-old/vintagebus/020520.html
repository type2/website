Subject: bumper overrider pieces
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am also in search of the overrider gaurd thingies.
(technical name of course) I have the bows and bumper
blades, I just need the front and rear upright pieces.
Looked for a set of 4 in good condition. i.e., not
tweaked. Let me know if you have a set you would like
to part with. I would rather give my money to someone
on the list, rather than buy these new from RMMW or
whoever. Thanks!
