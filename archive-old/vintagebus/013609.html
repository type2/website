There were 2 styles of camper kit available in '55. 
The one like Thom's (the Camp Box Standard) and a
Deluxe Export which sounds a lot like the one
described.  The deluxe export interior never had an
ice box, in fact pre`59 westys 'never' had an ice box.
 Yes, there was an actual propane fridge in the deluxe
interior as an option from late `56-`58.  And of
course the optional ice box `59-`61.  But not on the
`55's.

Also, the hatch top was optional until `58 then it
became standard on all Westys.  This is very rare and
most had them but according to Westfalia's acrchieves
they did exist.  So the absence of a hatch can't
pigeon hole the bus either.

Of course, definite answers can be had with photos. 
But would rather treat it like a westy now, until one
finds out if it is or not.   Better safe then sorry. I
know a certain fella in Salem Mass. who has a `55
Westy, bought it 15 years ago...could not believe the
ancient looking interior was really westfalia so he
dumped it in the trash!!!  Recently thru the grape
vine, he contacted me for help finding the &quot;correct&quot;
interior for this early westy.  Pictures, documents of
mine and actually Westfalia brochures later he
realized he in fact DID have the right interior in his
bus...which is now gone.  Of course he nearly
puked...he has NOT found a correct interior since!

&gt; That is a big assumption seeing the limited
&gt; description he gave.  There was
&gt; no mention of a hatch, ice box or other definitive
&gt; Westfalia &quot;markings&quot;.  I
&gt; too would like to see pictures.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a correct early westfalia.
