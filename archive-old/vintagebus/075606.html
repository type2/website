&gt;Okay you electrical wizards...

Electrical whizzer?  That story about me, too much beer, and the
electric fence is NOT true.

&gt;I just noticed the other day that when my ignition was switched to the
&gt;first or &quot;on&quot; position, that my taillights were both glowing dimly/
&gt;faintly.  I noticed that the lights go from off to the dimly lit level
&gt;slowly, over the course of a second or two, as if someone was controlling
&gt;them with a rheostat (like controlling your instrument lights with the
&gt;built in rheostat).

Your tail lights are being powered (or grounded) through some high
resistance path.  The low current doesn't generate as much heat in the
filaments, so they take longer to come on.  It is exactly the same as
controlling the dash lights with the variable resistor built into the
headlight switch.

Very generally, this most often happens when you've got a bad ground
somewhere, but other things can cause it.

&gt;In other words, the brake and running night lights seem to work
&gt;fine, it's just that now we have dimly lit taillights all the time
&gt;the ignition is switched &quot;on&quot;.

Key question: Which filament is doing the dim glowing?  You cannot tell
by looking at it through the red tail light lens.  You might be able to
tell by grounding one end of a test light really well and probing both
wires at the tail light socket to see which one lights the test light
(dimly, but it should be noticeable).  Or, take off the red lens and
check.  Calibrate your eye by turning on the parking lights first and
seeing whether the upper or lower filament glows.  Then turn the
parking lights off, let the bulbs cool for a minute or so, turn the
ignition on, and observe which filament is glowing.

I have a feeling that it's your brake/turn light filaments doing the
glowing, just because they are the ones that are controlled by the
ignition switch.  Not that it's impossible for the parking light
filaments to glow, but that it's just not as likely, given the symptoms
you have.

&gt;If one or both of the two brake light switches on the master cylinder
&gt;were to fail, could that cause the &quot;dim light thing&quot; to happen?

Sure.  The general failure mode of a switch is to fail open and not
work at all, but it's not unheard of for a switch to fail &quot;kind of
closed&quot; - a not-very-good contact between its terminals.

&gt;Is there any symptom of a failed brake light switch?

Usually, your brake lights don't work, or stay on bright all the time.
If it has failed mechanically, it might leak brake fluid.

&gt;Hell, how do you test them anyway (a procedure is probably in the
&gt;Bentley manual), mine are certainly old enough to be failing by now?

Here's what I would try.  This assumes that you have verified that the
brake light filament and not the parking light filament is glowing.
Pull out the second-from-the right fuse (16 amp) and turn on the
ignition.  If your tail lights have stopped glowing, the problem is
most likely in the brake light switches, 9 prong box, or turn signal
switch.  If they are still glowing, pull out the rightmost fuse (16
amp).  If they then stop glowing, the problem is probably in the 9
prong box.  If they are still glowing, there is a weird problem, or
maybe you didn't identify the filament correctly.

If pulling the second-from-right fuse made the tail lights stop glowing,
and you want to check out the brake light switches, proceed as follows.

Turn off the ignition and put all the fuses back.  Drop the pedal pan
and make a note of where all the brake light switch wires go - use tape
to mark them if you need to.  Now pull all 4 wires off their terminals
and don't let them touch each other or ground out on the Bus.  In the
cab, turn on the ignition switch, and check your tail lights.  If they
are still glowing dimly, the problem is not in your brake light switches.

If they do not glow, hook up both wires to one of the switches and check
the tail lights.  If they have started glowing dimly, that switch /
axle is suspect.  If they are not glowing, pull the wires off of that
switch, hook up the wires to the other switch, and check the tail
lights again.  If they have started glowing dimly, the switch / axle
with the wires on it is suspect.  If they still haven't started glowing,
hook all 4 wires back up like they were; if that starts them glowing,
then both switches / axles are suspect.  Turn the ignition key off.

I said &quot;switch / axle&quot; because the problem could be a bum switch, or
a problem with the hydraulic circuit for that axle.  If you suspect
both switches, try both axles, but if not, follow the closest pipe
to the switch to figure out whether it's for the front or rear brakes.
Turn the ignition switch on and crack open a bleeder valve on that
axle.  If that makes the lights go out, you may have a problem with
the brakes on that axle, like a deteriorated rubber hose or weak
return springs on the shoes.  If the lights still don't go out, the
problem is probably in the switch.

If disconnecting all 4 wires to the brake light switches didn't stop
the glow, then it might be coming from somewhere besides the brake
circuit, like the turn signals.  You might want to check out my
9-prong box article at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html
to test the turn signal system.

&gt;Also, can anyone point me in the direction of a source for the small
&gt;parking light bulbs found inside the USA spec. headlamp assemblies
&gt;in a 6 volt 1.2 amp (NOT the common 1.5 amp bulb!) for my '59 BNNTA
&gt;event Panel Bus.

You might look at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/bulbs.html .
VW specified either #81 (6.50 V, 1.02 A, 6.63 W, 6 cp) or #63 (7.00 V,
0.63 A, 4.41 W, 3 cp) for '58-'66 US-spec Buses.  Check your local
FLAPS; you might get lucky.

I hope this helps!
