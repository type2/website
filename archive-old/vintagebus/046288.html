&lt;&lt; so I'm thinking its the #3 or #4 cylinder thats burning oil...but it did 
this for a short amount of time....30 seconds maybe... it has done this 
before too...but just for short little spurts....it doesn't happen much at 
all...but I'm curious as to why it happens. &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
If it only happens just after first starting your engine it is due to a 
slight tilt to the engine.  Which allows a small amount of oil to collect, 
seep past the rings, to get burnt when you start it.  Remember the cylinders 
are totally horizontal so this happens easily!   Eric&amp;Barb
