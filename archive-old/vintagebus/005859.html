I thought I would throw in the rest of money now.  I already threw in my .02

For the people that say they would have to wade thru bay window stuff to get
to split stuff.  Give me a break.  Thom is a smart individual. If he does
decide to add the bay window stuff to his site, I am sure he would make a
button from the main page that just said bay window or something similar.
And if you didn't click on it you would never know it was there.  So the
splitty only people would never even have to see a bay window unless they
clicked on the link. Or he would do something similar.

The split scene is getting smaller every day.  We need to stay joined as
much as possible. Bus Depot by it's name should sell only bus parts, however
they can not stay in business doing just that.  They have to sell bug and
other VW parts to stay above water.

Also just because Thom may add a picture of a baywindow to his site, that
has nothing to do with this list.

As far as www.type2_dot_com being a baywindow site.  That site was made when the
splits and bays were on one list.  (Yes I remember) Therefore there is split
stuff there also.  If this is supposed to be the bay site does that mean all
the split stuff should be taken off of that site???  Should bay people have
to wade thru all the split stuff to get to the good bay window stuff??  I am
not even serious, just trying to make a point.

In the end it will be Thom's decision....  If he does decide to do it, I am
sure he will do a good job of it.
