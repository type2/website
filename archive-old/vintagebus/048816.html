Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch wing-nut won't move...got it

OK. Got it off. The wing nut was FROZE in place and wouldn't turn 
either way with plyers or screwdriver. Here's how I did it.

I put the vise grips on the back side of the nut to keep it from 
moving. I then grabbed my big 36MM socket and wrench. Not enough room 
to put it on, so I had my wife pust the pedal down enough for me to 
slip it on and wedge it to get a grip on the wing nut. Took a few 
minutes and a few re-adjustments of my tools, but I was able to get 
it close enough to the end of the threads that I could turn it the 
rest of the way off (painfully I might add) with my fingers. Yee Haw.

I went ahead and took it all the way off so I could clean the threads 
and the nut up to hopefully make it work a little better

Good ol Muir says that the wing nut was a big improvement over just 
having a regular nut on there. I think for my bus I disagree! with 
the heater box, some part of the doghouse tin, and the tranny, there 
is NO room for my hand to get up there and actually get a hold of the 
wing nut. I can touch it. But I can't get to it like the nut is 
disigned to be used. For me, a simple socket would be MUCH better. I 
can get a socket wrench up in there no sweat. I may not be able to 
turn it but a few clicks at a time. But at least I can turn it. My 
opinion.

Any reason why I shouldn't switch it over to a regular nut with 
another nut to lock it in place?
