&lt;&lt; after getting a letter from ron at bus depot trying to justify all of his 
 companys wrong doing. I sent the following reply to his excuses .
 &gt; you got a excuse for everthing dont you ?
 &gt; It doesn't matter any how I am done with you
 &gt; thanks for wasting my time
 
 what a business man to respond with the following appology 
 
 Well, the feeling's mutual.
 - Ron Salmon
 
 thanks ron you are quite a gentleman 
  &gt;&gt;

If I was to sit back and look, it looks childish. Lets argue about something
