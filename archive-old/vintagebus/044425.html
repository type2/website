EB has come and gone for this year but I have a plan for EB 2002. We 
will conduct a 50/50 raffle whereby 50% of the pot will go to the 
raffle winner and 50% of the pot will be presented to type2_dot_com for 
future operating expenses.

If any other bus event organizers out there would like to jump on the 
fundraising band-wagen please feel free. There is lots of room and it 
is air-cooled :)

For the record EB is a NO PROFIT event. All fees collected are 
collected on behalf of Hagen-Stone Park and represent normal camping 
fees. Whatever money and effort it takes to put EB on is purely 
voluntary. The 50/50 raffle will only be held to benefit type2_dot_com 
which has spiritually supported EB from the beginning. The least EB 
can do is give a little back.
