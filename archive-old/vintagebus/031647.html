It also has air bag suspension and lots of other neet trick little goodies,
he has way over the 10 g asking price in it and I can't believe John has it
up for sale.

Subject: [VB] Double Door Sunroof Barndoor Panel


I just came from Everetts classified site and saw this thing. I love it! I
know this
probably goes against everything a lot of you believe in but I really like
it. I
wouldn't build it and at $10,000 for a wavy bus still in Purple primer with
what
looks like rattle can black underneath, I am not going to buy it. You can
check it
out at the Samba_dot_com under classifieds. The guy welded a deluxe sunroof roof
section
and barndoor front overhang (or lack there of) onto an early walk-through
double
door panel. Check out the picture of it with the doors out and the sunroof
open. It
will be interesting to see if there is enough support there. I guess VW did
Double
Door sunroofs so they must be able to take it. I know I am risking any small
part of
credibility I may have had (not that I really had any to start with), but I
want one
of those!
just had to share,
