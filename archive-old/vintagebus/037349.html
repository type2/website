I had writ:

&gt;They use a lot of petrol, (gas eaters (sic) John Muir), but are good for
&gt;camping and to get the inside of the bus warm and windows defogged quickly
&gt;upon start up.   Not a substitute for a good working stock heater system, or
&gt;you will pay in fuel prices, and also not a substitute for fixing drafty
doors
&gt;and windows.   If it is a bus you will drive when it is freezing outside, a
&gt;gas heater makes life quite pleasant.

And Ron writ:

The 6v &amp; 12v BN4s use between .4 to 1.3 pints of fuel per hour, depending
upon where you set the temperature control (heat output 4k-16k BTU).  A
gasoline heater is an excellent investment for cold weather driving, fuel
consumption is nominal.
- -- --   - -
so I have heard.  But my experience, and what I have heard from some people
who have used them, is that they are gas eaters.   Perhaps it was not properly
tuned up- I don't know much about them.  But that's my story.   Perhaps
someone I haven't talked to gets better &quot;milage&quot; out of a gas eater.
Survey?  anyone out there have a gas (h)eater?

letsee, if it uses a pint an hour (1/8 gallon/hour), and you drive for an hour
on the freeway at 55mph, and your milage is usually 25mpg, it would up the gas
use down from say 2.2 gallons comsumption to 2.325  consumption which is only
a drop to circa 23.7 mpg.

that wasn't what I found, though I still thought it great for defogging all
the windows and heating the bus up right away, and worth it on those days with
snow on the ground. Here the windows tend to fog up in winter- and the
defogger works great for the windsheilds, and also good for the cab door
windows, but not so good for the rear ones, so the heater  was a visability
improvement, and I didn't have to go wipe all the windows off, and I could sit
lazily in the warm bus on a cold morning.  (when I drove it, which wasn't
often)

As someone said
 &quot;in theory, theory and practice are the same,
but in practice they aren't&quot;
