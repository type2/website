&gt; At the end of June, Lisa and I are heading from Union, Oregon to

&gt; most all of Ohio. With any luck we'll try to continue on through 
&gt; Pennsylvania and Maryland to DC so I can at last see the Smithsonian. 

well if you finally make it give a hollar,  there a couple of us in the DC
area, I'm outside of Baltimore and have the 78 blue/white with the canoe
on the roof so give a wave.
