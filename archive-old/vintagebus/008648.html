I came across a church key a few days back, price was right so I bought it.
I was wondering if it's an early one, it's a &quot;T&quot; type and is a bit smaller
than the the &quot;P&quot; ones.  Here's a pic of it next to a &quot;normal&quot; one:

I thought the &quot;T&quot; ones were the same general size as the &quot;P&quot; ones but I've
only seen the repros.  The dimensions of it are as follows:
Top oval:  1.5&quot; by 7/8&quot;
Height:    4&quot;


What's the original of the term &quot;church key&quot; anyway?

Any info is welcome,
