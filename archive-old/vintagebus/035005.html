&lt;&lt; Well, does anyone know how to make their own tent that goes out the door 
of the bus?  They are so expensive to buy. &gt;&gt;
Hi Tim,
It depends on which model of tent you are talking about!  Riveria, Sundial, 
and late model Westie tents can be bought used cheaper than it would cost 
just to buy simular new material!   Eric&amp;Barb
