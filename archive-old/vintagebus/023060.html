I didn't see it in their list of rules, but they seem to have left it
open-ended.

Actually, I find it very annoying when people use the &quot;not NOS&quot; crap.

And I see the toy hawkers have made their way to &quot;ebay motors&quot; - it was
nice not having to wade thru all the toys to get to the parts.  It should
be flooded with hotwheels crap, t-shirts, necklaces and bongs and day now...

They also go on about forbidden HTML tags; I'm surprised the still allow
HTML - most sites don't, to prevent offsite attacks.
