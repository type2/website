Subject: Fw: [VB] Kelly Park

 Hi, Went to the red barn on Saturday and Kelly park on Sunday with 3
friends all
 the way from Quibec Canada. Spent a couple days to san Francisco.
(Alcatraz, Golden Gate, Muir woods, SF cable car and Lombard street (remind
me the Herbie movie)...and we had a great time).
 Saturday I watched all those type 2 lying on the pavement in their rusty
dresses! I love those busses. We find a couple of small things for our
 projects. It was great to see all those busses in one place. Here when we
 saw 3 split busses at the same place it's a large rassemblement!
 Sunday at the Kelly park it was great too. We do not saw a lot of stocker
 almost every car or busses were dropped or modified.
 The bad is that we lost all the pictures taken on the saturday and some of
 the sunday. On the sunday there was a split bus with a Turkey ''splashed''
 on the nose. I dont know if somebody had a picture of that bus. If somebody
has a pic of that truck please send me a copy of it at:
 ciw165_at_globetrotter_dot_net
 Thanks everybody!   we had a great time this week end.
 Bye from Canada
