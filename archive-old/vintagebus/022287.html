Subject: Bus Tranny questions
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a '62 panel van that needs to be a daily driver at freeway speeds
(65 mph - 70 mph).  I know that &quot;freeway&quot; trannies are available for bugs,
but are they available for busses?  If not, is it feasible to convert the
bus to IRS and install a bug tranny?  I've heard that these are done, but
have reservations...what is the best choice?

Josh
