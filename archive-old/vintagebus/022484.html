&gt;I have a 64 sundial conversion bus  with the 2/3's 1/3rd seats up front and

&gt;seats and still have it look some what similar to stock (I like that look)
&gt;What do you guys suggest? What did you do?

I bought mine from Lenny, and it's not cheap, but it's so close to stock
you can hardly tell the difference.  As a cheaper alternative, you can use
sewfine or TMI.  Sewfine's stuff is made well, but doesn't look stock.  TMI
is one step lower.

For the '55, I put a layer of denim directly on the springs, then a layer
of this soft brillo-pad like substance, then a layer of 1&quot; foam.  On the
bottoms, I put a layer of 3/4&quot; carpet padding between the brillo and the
foam.  These seats are the nicest I have *ever* sat on, and the cushiest!
