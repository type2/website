&gt;Obviously, true flexibility and reliable joints (minimized, of course) 
&gt;would be a key to the longetivity of a leak-free system.

It would also help a little that you only want to use it while parked.
For some reason I thought you wanted to use this while moving, too.
There would still be fluid in the system while driving, but since it
wouldn't be under pressure with the system off, it'd be slightly less
likely to start leaking at a marginal spot that's getting bounced
around on the road.

&gt;The modern systems do use pressurized water circulated by a pump.
&gt;I don't know what the pressure in the lines is, nor do I know how
&gt;much electrical energy would be required to move the fluid.

I would guess that the pressure wouldn't be too much; probably not
over 10 to 20 PSI or so (1 +/- 0.3 atmospheres).

The energy to run the pump has lots of variables.  Generally, it
would help with energy if you could cycle the system on and off
instead of running it continuously.

&gt;This is NOT a replacement for a good, tight stock heater when underway!

Idea: If you installed a booster fan in the stock system, either at
the engine or up front, you could run that for a few minutes after
stopping, to extract that last bit of heat before the heat exchangers
finally cool to ambient.  Once the heat is gone, it's gone, but it
would give you some &quot;inexpensive&quot; heat, energy-wise.

&gt;I say (presumably) well-insulated interior because I'll soon have all new
&gt;seals, and the insulation in the panels and roof is to be upgraded....any
&gt;suggestions?  I'll probably use that space-age bubble stuff...

I have posted previously about using the Mylar bubble stuff (Reflectix
is one brand name) in a small home-built trailer with good results.
Check the Library at type2_dot_com for other info; the &quot;Heat, Rust and
Noise in VWs&quot; article has some good insulation info.

&gt;Here's my biggest problem, besides finding the magickal tubing, the
&gt;efficient boiler/pump unit that is small enough to be useful:  How does one
&gt;route the tubing back and forth without cutting any of the venerable frame
&gt;metal that is our bus?

Laying the tubing inside, on the floor, gets around some of this, but
you still need a hole or two in the sheet metal to go back and forth
to the boiler and pump.

If you only camp where there is commercial power (120/240/whatever)
available, then an electric heater is probably far simpler and cheaper.
But, propane or gasoline lets you have heat wherever you want.
