I thought the clutch wing nut was backing off because the clutch was
going away over a week. I tightened it, and it was fine.  Today, there
is no clutch because the cable is too loose. The wing nut was where I
left it, but the pedal now to the floor with too much slack in cable.
What is up??? Any ideas?

 

Thanks in advance,
