Subject: Re:  [VB] homemade roof rack clamps?

i red in th type2_dot_com archives that you can make 
roof rack clamps out of turnbuckels.

can i ask what is a turnbuckle??
ive seen them on wwf not at home depot.

 = == = = =
go ask a t a hardware store- they will show you one.  The main deal is that 
when you turn the cente thing, you tighten both ends together.   so you grind 
most of the hook off one end so it will fit under your rain gutter, and hook 
the other end on the rack, and twist the midde too tighten the two together.  
 attach this by an upright, and use a hose clamp to attach the turnbuckle to 
the leg of the rack.

worked for me for years   Someone can take a pic of this on my 61 with their 
digicam and post it somewhere.
