A few months ago I got into an accident and cracked my transmission.  This 
last weekend I came across a '66 Beetle swing-axle with 65K on it for a good 
price.  Is it possible to put my RGB's and old axles (or new one's if 
they're bent) on that transmission, or should I just remove the RGB's 
altogether?  Were Bug and Bus transmissions the same, with the Bus having 
reduction gears to compensate for the wieght and hauling capacity?  Happy 
driving--Chet
