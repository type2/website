&gt; &lt;&lt; What has the better chance of getting a seized plug out and saving the
&gt;  threads...   Cold engine, warm engine, hot engine??? &gt;&gt;

&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; Probably best to just have it a bit warm after starting and running it about 
&gt; 5 minutes.  Aluminum of the head and other parts of the engine swell in size 
&gt; faster than the steel parts.  So the threaded hole will probably be bigger 
&gt; than the spark plug when just warmed up a bit.  

This probably isn't very good advice. It's true that the aluminum expands
faster than the steel. The problem is that expansion makes the spark plug
holes smaller(tighter). This combined with the fact that the spark plug
has gotten larger will make it much more difficult to remove.
