The midwest didn't warm up to the realities of
better vehicles being made other than in the
USA for quite awhile.  The coasts found out
about them earlier, thus they became more
acceptable sooner.

As late as 1984, VW's were so rare in Detroit,that when I pulled into a parking lot with my '76 ASI
camper, the driver of the only other VW I saw (a 
bug) jumped out, ran over and gave me a big hug!

It just took time to become aware that 'most' of
the world was making better cars, so that by the
time they did, it was past the time for splits
being sold at the dealers in any quantities.
