Hey Split Nosers,

  For some odd reason I thought the What-Not cabinet was the cabinet on
the left side rear when you open the cargo door.  [If not, what is that
pieces name?] It can not funtion that well in a bus that has the spare
tire well, cause that is its bottom floor.

  The spice rack has to be one of the most challenging items to glue back
together there ever was.  You need many 2-3' pipe or bar clamps, some thin
strap tie downs, at least two people and the ablility to laugh about it if
it don't work the first few times!

Best,
joe
