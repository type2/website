Wow,, this is deja vu,,,
years ago,,I used to race the class 5 Baja bug,,, and I always heard of
Mario flat towing his Race Car,, we were kinda ruff on these cars so it
seemed risky,,, why not use a trailer?
He always bragged about towing behind the &quot;motorhome&quot;... which we never
saw,,, cause he would drive the Race Car to the track from the Campsite,,,
Until
he blew up the engine in the Motorhome on the way to the track,,, so his
Wife got behind the wheel of the Motorhome,,, he hopped in the Race car on
the tow bar, and Pushed the Motorhome the rest of the way to the Track,,,
He Raced his Heat,, the feature,, and a Championship race with a bunch of
loonie tunes 4X4 guys,,,, then  took the engine out of the Race car,, and
Put it into the MotorHome....
His '71 Westfalia!!!
ya gotta &quot;Run what ya brung&quot;

until the next story!   Keep reading for the Towbar stuff

&gt;I had a crazy idea... If I had a hitch for my bus and a towbar for the
&gt;bug, I could drive the bug up there, swap the engine into the bus, then
&gt;tow the bug home...
&gt;
&gt;I've got a bug towbar at work and several bug hitches... I was wondering
&gt;if it was possible to modify a bug hitch to fit the bus.


The Bus beam is larger than the Bug,,  So I used a small grinder and opened
up the &quot;jaws&quot; of the towbar,,, but my towbar was already long enough,,,
yours may have to be lengthned as well .
