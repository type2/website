As for me (and I'm sure, several others out there..), it would still have to
be a waterPROOF container  clipped to the visor, for as I amble down the
road through heavy rain, the water dripping from the OH vent collects on the
visor and splashes onto me when I slow or turn.....I hope this goes away
with a new vent flap seal!

&gt; At a FLAPS they sell one that will attach to the
&gt; visor. Mine stays high and dry.
