Subject: Hello, and Check Your Vents!
Date: Mon, 27 Mar 2000 08:05:39 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello all....

I would like to say that I'm happy to be on &quot;the list&quot; again.   And happy I
am to have a good reason for it!  There was this ad, you see, in the local
(Santa Rosa, CA) paper, which read:
 1967 VW Kombi Van, 0 mi. on rebuilt trans. &amp; reduction boxes. New 1600
balanced. New brakes &amp; susp. Registered. Restoration in progress. $2500/obo.

Well, needless to say, that particular beast lives here now (he got his
$2500) and I am in the process of  seeking and destroying all rust or
possibility of future rusting.  I will have a report soon on the quality and
effectiveness of POR-15 from Resto-motive Labs....it's another of those
rust-killer-transmogrifier-sealer products, and I have only found one that
seems to really work (&quot;Rust Neutralizer&quot; from Proven Solutions does make a
great primer primer).  This leads me to the second part of the subject:
Check your vents!

I knew that I had to take the vent access plate off when I felt the way the
handle was loose and the flap seemed sticky, and I was aware that I might
find something nasty lurking up there, as that is a channel for cold, wet
air, so I was not surprised to find quite a bit of rust forming on the
underside of the roof and in the little pockets and crevices that are
created by the vent housing.  My advice to you, if you have not done so
already, is to dismantle your ventilator system and clean it out!  I'm
really glad that I caught the rust in there now, as the roof of this bus is
rust-free (at least from the outside), and it would be a shame for it to
develop holes from within!  I'll be trying the POR-15 on this and other
areas that are hard to reach and/or replace.

When the former owner and I finally got the bus to my house (we towed
it...no lights or windows), we had a great deal of fun taking it for a brief
and very windy drive...it runs/feels great!  I'll tell ya, the existence of
wind-shields is never more appreciated after a ride like that! Maybe they
should also be called &quot;bug-shields&quot;!

Well, I'll put more details in later posts as things develop.....and I'll
leave you with a copy of what is on my clipboard, because I kept having to
re-type it, and I may find some sympathy from this list:

Hello...

My name is Gene, and there is a '67 Type II Kombi lurking in my garage.  I
am in the process of disassembly (everything), and the groovy dreams I have
of re-assembling all the fixed, de-rusted, and new parts are what I'm using
as fuel.

There are a couple things I am hoping to find:  One (probably the most
important) is the white steering wheel from a Deluxe with the gold Wolfsburg
insignia....I would gleefully stick a bug's batwing wheel on the column if I
could find one, even though it isn't &quot;proper&quot;...or is it?

The other item I be seeking is that groovy clock found on the passenger-side
dash of the Deluxe buses (my old '62 had one, which I thought was cool, even
though it didn't work) What (and I welcome mild flames) are your feelings
about cutting (ouch) the dash to put such a clock in?

And, to keep things topical, I might be interested in a stock
radio...although I might modify it to be the controls of the modern stereo
hidden tastefully out of sight.  What is the deal with the '67 radio hole,
anyway?

Please get back to me with info.....

Thanks, Gene
