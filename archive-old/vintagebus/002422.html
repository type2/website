&gt;Um, perhaps because those specific tanks are designed to operate on
&gt;their sides, just as the tanks in Westys are?


Good point George!  I never gave it any thought before that some tanks are
designed to be run in certain positions.  Man, if I ever convert to running
an engine on bug/bus, this is definitely something I'll have to keep in
mind.  Thanks for the clarification!
