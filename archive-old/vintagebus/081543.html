Subject: Re: [VB] re:engine mount

Finally figured it out. The dxxn wing nut. I used to have the standard
double nut arrangement on my transmission cable. I have the KD wrenches to
adjust them too. The restoration shop did me a &quot;favor&quot; and install the wing
nut. No wonder you all cannot get a wrench on that bolt head. It used to be
a snap to get that out. The edge of the 3/8 drive socket would catch on the
larger nut and push it back as the bolt came out.  Grrrr. New Fangled
ideas...... Can't people just leave a good thing alone....
