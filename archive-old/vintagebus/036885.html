&lt;&lt;  I have never experienced one of those shift linkage switches. All of the
earlier than 67 buses with back up lights that I have seen, have the switch
behind the speedo, inline with the speedo cable. When you start backing up,
the switch then opens because........the speedo cable is also turning
backwards.   &gt;&gt;
      Hi  Mike,
Right, thanks for reminding us about that one.  That type was introduced
somewhere in the 1960s and the type we are talking about is from the late
1940s or early 1950s and used up to the early 1960s.  Eric &amp; Barb
