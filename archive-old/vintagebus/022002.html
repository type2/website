Here's a good one: ever seen a &quot;late-model&quot; RHD bus?  Notice how
it has the handle recess that prevents it from hitting the front
ca door, on the *rear* door, even though there's no door for it to hit?
0 0 0 - - - - - - 

And on those late (64-67?)  double door buses too- they just stick the same 
doors on the other side of the bus, and the froward on on the LHS doesn't hae 
the indent, but the rear one does.
