It means that it just needs a nice 6 volt starter with a 12 volt solenoid;)

I was just looking through the classifieds on Everetts site, as I do
everyday, looking for my next project.  There's an ad for a 56 Kombi with
the following quote, taken verbatim from the listing &gt;&gt;&quot;The bus has a
running 36 horse motor in it. It does not run right now...&lt;&lt;&quot;  WTF??  Oh
well, in the seller's defense, the bus was listed for VERY cheap and was
probably worth the money whether it was running or running!!! ;^)
