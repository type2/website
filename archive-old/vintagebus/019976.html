The problem with creating good quality, complex repro bits is not so much the up-front
cost, which is considerable, but rather the committment and follow-up of the potential
customers to actually lay out the cash and actually buy the stuff.  With that in mind,
one has to choose wisely when deciding what to repro and what to leave for a more 
adventurous entreprenuer.

I too have investigated creating various reproductions.  For example, I looked at reproing
westy roof rack clamps several years ago.  I have a engineering &amp; machine shop contact who's
nothing short of a genius; he holds several patents, including the first maglev track patent.
He could build me just about anything I wanted if I had enough cash.  He looked at the original
sample I gave him, and came back with a quote of ~$22 each.  They would have been perfect,
but after tooling costs and the initial run, I would have had to sell then at ~$30 each
to break even.  I looked at creating a small die to use to re-stamp (ie repair) ribbed
bumper centers, which would be taken from an NOS bumper, and it would have run me ~$500
for the tooling and machining.

As an example, it would be great to be able to buy repop single cab gates, but the outlay to do a pressing
of that size would be tremendous.   My hunch is that correctly done repops would probably
run $1500-$2000 a set.  How many of you would be willing to pony up that kinda cash?  I have
anectdotal evidence to suggest that some reproers had a hard time exhausting their inventories,
while others can't keep enough in stock.  For example, the repro vent trim flies out the door
about as fast as it comes out of the mill, but safari wiper shafts languished in inventory
(although I'll take a second set if he still has some).

Ronnie has been playing it very smart in choosing what to repop.  From what it appears, the
ribbed bumpers have been an unqualified success.  Perhaps the difference between previous
repro attempts and Ronnie's were *marketing*;   Ronnie has a considerable internet customer
base, while others had to rely on word-of-mouth and contacts at shows..   Maybe Ronnie should 
set himself up as a distribution point for repro bits.  A small online catalog section and 
some well-placed links would pay off handsomely.

I know there are other repro bits out there; wood slats, deluxe trim, kick panels, interior  
panels, bumper trim, hurst bumpers - the list goes on.  I'm personally very open to using
repro bits, and have used a lot of different ones, some good, some bad.

As a first step, I've added a section to my Image Gallery for repro.  If you know of any 
repro pieces, or make them yourself, please fell free to upload a pic and contact information.

BTW, if anyone has a set of repro or original hoops and canvas for a single cab...
