Hey Thom, 

I checked out that Single Cab for sale at BW dismantler's in Roseville.
Turned out to be a sweet deal. Its a 1958 model. Original paint Dove Blue,
has been repainted orange many years back. Both rear corners have their
share of dents/dings. All gates are there with no major wounds, just minor
rust. Interior is very nice (because there is so little interior to begin
with :)  bed is in good shape. One treasure-chest door intact. Original
split-case tranny, no motor. All original glass  except for rear window.
Correct taillights, bumpers, headlights, and turn sigs. The decklid hinge
carrier will have to be replaced. 15&quot; rims with 2 flat tires rounds the old
worker out. I made the deal, put it on the trailer and a short time later
it was in my driveway. Just goes to show you that the &quot;deals&quot; are still out
there ! Good hunting!

James Fischer
