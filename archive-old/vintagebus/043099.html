I have bought some really good quality tools for at least half of what
they would normally sell for at local pawn shops around here.
Seems that they have become very popular and more upstyle in an effort, I
suppose to shed the old sterotype associated with them in the past.??
Give it a shot....those kinds of measuring tools are usually in stock.
Sometimes....the tools are in original containers and have some
calibration documentiation attatched.  A big plus.  Not all machine shops
have the facilities to calibrate, and at the $58 to $70 an hour fees for
calibrating...makes a good deal on a micrometer go to hell quick!
Just an idea!
later
