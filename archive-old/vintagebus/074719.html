Subject: headliner questions

Trying to put in my headliner in a 13 window deluxe. I was hoping that
somebody on this list has done this, i'm screwing up every way possible, I
think I got sold a headliner that was just too damn small. Well anyways here
are some pictures of my awful headliner, anybody help?? Please!
