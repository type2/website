Pete:

I was there. For a Redding event it was not bad. It was a little bigger than 
I expected.

By that, I mean there were about 25 to 30 cars in the show and maybe 15 
people selling in the swap meet. I was gone by the time the drag racing was 
scheduled to start, but there were only 2 cars signed up the last I heard.

I picked up a near perfect vent window frame for $1.00.
