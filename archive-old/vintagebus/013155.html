Rob Laffoon and others lust after the 1999 VW Classic Tshirts without being
able to attend...

My memory tells me that there is usually an ad in HotVWs Magazine following
the Classic which advertises Tshirts from the (then) recently past event. If
in doubt, I would contact Rich Kimball/or staff of Periscope Enterprises at
vwclassic_at_earthlink_dot_net.

Tell 'em that &quot;Uncle JERRY!!!!!&quot; sent you and leave me the hell out of the
loop. &lt;kidding&gt; =)
