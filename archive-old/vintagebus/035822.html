I am considering a bus for sale, I think a '66, where the owner describes a

serious shimmy.  Here are his exact words:



  &quot;The main problem is that at about 30mph it shimmys a lot. I've checked

tie rods etc., and adjusted the steering gear. No go. I think the steering

gear might be bad.&quot;
 - - - -  -
it seems doubtful that a worn steering gear box would cause a shimmy.   I
would suspect bad tires.  

 A worn s.g.b. would make play in the steering, and often a thunk.
Inspecting he front end for play is a good Idea, with  the front wheels off
the ground.  Look in idiot book for details, have a friend wiggle the steering
wheel while you look at the moving parts for slop.   A bad steering damper
will cause shimmying when you hit a bump in the road, and will go away when
you steer out of the shimmy.   

I have a couple ramps I can drive up onto, that are good for changing a
steering gear box, then you can have room to pull the box and column out, and
not have to work under a jacked up vehicle with the dangers thereof.
