Subject: Old Shop Teacher out for summer!!

I have got to say goodbye from school for the summer.  Today is our last
day here, so I am signing off for now.

I'll be spending the next few days getting ready for a long trek to the
Classic, so I hope to meet some of you there.  If you see a couple
overweight guys who look out of place in overalls and seed dealer caps (or
bandanas) you'll know it's a couple midwest farm boys!!

If you need get in touch with me, or need South Wind gas heater parts, drop
me an email at home at &lt;BusBarn_at_Prodigy_dot_net&gt;.


Ramblings from an old shop teacher,
Rick Taylor
