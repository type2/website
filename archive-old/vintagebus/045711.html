Remember several months ago, we mentioned that we would review the second 
generation Tmi vintage bus upholstery when we saw samples.
First of all, what we mean by second generation is Tmi has been selling what 
they term as &quot;OEM Classic Vinyls&quot; for some time now. Which were by no means 
correct color or texture. Why advertise the stuff as OEM when it's not 
correct?
Anyway, we finally received samples of the Salt N Pepper, Platinum.
           (for the center of door panels and faces/tops of the seats)
Two thumbs up!!!

The texture is very, very close to original. Way to go. We'll use this stuff.
Color is close also.

The solid Platinum, for the sides of the seats and top and bottom of the door 
panels on the other hand is WAY OFF.

It would appear that Tmi used a sun baked piece of original material for a 
sample.

The original solid platinum should be just that, PLATINUM not Copper/Tan.

If you want to compare we'll be glad to send samples of the correct solid 
Platinum.

All and all we give our recommendation on the Platinum SNP, but stay away 
from the solid Platinum until they get it right, or request a sample of ours.

For those of you who are wondering why we would critique the competitors 
material,
remember, we are a restoration shop first, our main goal is to restore these 
buses to absolute perfection. We like to think we pushed Tmi to do this, 
we'll see how well Tmi makes the panels and what comes with the Tmi interior 
kit in the near future. We'll let you know. Keep restoring, these buses are 
only going up in value if restored correctly.
