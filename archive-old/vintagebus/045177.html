After 5000 miles of a nearly trouble free trip from Minneapolis to the 
Canadian Rockies, my fuel gauge became stuck at just over 1/2 a tank only 200 
miles from home. I think it is from the tank sender as the needle in the 
gauge up front goes down when the key is turned off, perhaps the float is 
stuck. Anyway, is there a way to rebuild these units? Is it possible to
get them out without pulling the engine?

you can reach around the motor and unplug the wire from the tank.   Ground it 
to the body, and (turn ignition on) the gas guage should read full.   If it 
still reads half, the guage is stuck.   You can buy a new sender for i think 
just under $40.   It is easy to pull the motor and tank, to get to the 
sender.   you may find it useful to take the opportunity to replace fuel ine, 
tranny boots, engine to ody seal, etc.
