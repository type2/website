&gt;well, that looks like an 6 April 65  bus to me - with the 9 digit vin the
&gt;third number is the YOM,  okay.

alles klar

&gt;  Don't understand though the may 5-11 bit, thoughthe called its last day the
&gt;production date, and that it would be april 65.

BUT - my bus is chassis number is 148182 , and Moore's is 143678... wacky
as things get on a production line, I doubt that they made busses by
counting backwards on 'em. So his HAS to have been made BEFORE mine. Ten
days and 4504 busses before mine. So mine must have been made in May, not
April, despite what the plate says.

What we need is someone who was there to remember how the line worked, and
how chassis numbers were assigned; everyone wants to talk to the Pons,
Nordhoffs and Hirsts, but all you folks living in or travelling to Germany
NEED to look up old floor men and quiz the sh*t outta 'em on how the place
functioned.  The corporate memory barely remembers the Rabbit, let alone
how the guy stamping bumpers on a 58 did his job. Any history majors (I,
sadly, am no longer in school), I smell a thesis!!


&gt;they dropped the year off the date line at some point- either for 64 or 65
&gt;model year.  definately 65s did not have it- the date line reads DAY then
&gt;MONTH.


What we were confused by a few months ago was that the bus plate is STAMPED
being made April 6, but that Siftung claimed that it was built in MAY.
Michael Moore's bus production numbers prove that my truck WAS made in May,
so I guess we are stil back to assuming that the plate was stamped wrong.
Why all the fuss? Well, its Saturday and I have no money to go out, so I'm
typing to YOU folks for one (and its a slow List night), but mainly I like
unravelling mysteries.......
