Subject: Re: clunking from rear wheel/reduction box

&gt;I replaced my outer rear axle seal a couple months ago and since have had
&gt;an intermittant clunking that appears to be coming from the reduction box
&gt;on that wheel ( driver's side).

Some ideas: Check the bolts that hold the reduction box to the spring
plate (both sides of the Bus).

You got the big nut on the end of the stub axle (holds the drum on) nice
and tight, right?

With the top plug in the box out, you can rotate the drum and inspect all
the teeth on the top gear.  The same trick works for the bottom gear but
then you have to wait for the fluid to mostly drain first.

If you want to rule out the brakes, you can take all the brake stuff off
of the backing plate.  Seal up the brake line that goes to that wheel
with the directions in http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/010102.html .
Go drive around (remembering that you're short one rear brake) and if
the noise is gone, it was probably something in the brakes - then you
get to figure out what part of the brakes it was.

I would think that if one of the bearings on the stub axle was really
shot, you might notice some play in it when wiggling it (or wiggling it
with the drum or drum+wheel attached), but I'm not sure.  A little axial
play (in and out) might be OK but any radial play (up and down) is
probably bad.

Good luck!
