Hi Dan,
We would be interested!  Forgot to mention the Hirshler antennas have a small 
case &quot;h&quot; with a circle around it on the base.  Whoops Hirshler is actually 
Hirschmann!  The Bosch have no markings that we know of on the antenna.  
Telefunken antennas have a really cool art deco piece at the base of the 
metal rod of the antenna.  This piece shows the Telefunken name twice once 
vertical and once in thier square logo.  This last antenna is really hard to 
find and of course we have been keeping an eye out for one for our 1952 split 
window!  HA!    Eric&amp;Barb
