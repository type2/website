Subject: Bought a 61 Westy

Hey Volks

TIARFOMB!!!

Bought a 61 Westy (27 October 1960).

This is the oldest Westy I've seen in this country (South Africa). It's in
great shape, absolutely straight body and mostly complete interior. The
clamshell lamps are missing and the original plaid upholstery is in shreds.
The only rust is in the rocker below the cargo doors, probably because of a
leaking roof hatch. Bus has no engine, but original small-nut tranny is
there. It also has a weird brake booster set-up in the left side of the
engine bay.

Bus has factory safaris and six pop-outs, though these aren't shown on
M-plate. Round taillights have been replaced with square trailer lights
involving body hack. Bus is painted red over original sealing wax red/beige
grey combo. Oh, and it has a side awning, not orig for this bus, not
red/white but orange/blue? instead, and it's missing some of the poles, but
has all the mounts on the bus.

Here's the M-code plate for you minutiae collectors (please help me decode
the unknown ones!)
