Subject: RE: [VB] SoCal bus owners... favor please!!!

Thanks Ronnie... It makes more since that wilmington is near LA and not
SD... I was just going on what was emailed to me.

So Volks, anyone going from SF to LA some time soon that could transport
a double cab roof section?



David


Ronnie corrected me:
  Wilmington is near the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, not even
close
to San Diego, have somebody from up there bring it to the next Pomona or
the
Classic, always people from the bay area coming to L A
