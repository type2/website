I had a friend who's bus was towed very quickly from in front of his house by his neighborhood association.  That is why I don't have one (an association).  I offered to drive the rusty bus over there and park it for a while.  Why don't you invite a bunch of us with ugly beater buses over for dinner or something or to stay for a week and they will be happy to have one double cab sitting there after that :)

Have ugly bus, will travel.

I told my neighbor that I'm considering getting a couple of butt-ugly
beater busses, making sure they can run, license and insure them and
then drive them every third day just to piss off the whiner that is
complaining about my truck.
