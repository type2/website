&gt; Eric,
&gt; I found your stats on the weight on each corner very interesting.
&gt; I would have guessed that there would have been a lot more of a weight
&gt; bias towards the rear!

I was VERY suprised to see the #'s on each wheel as well. I would have
thought it would be closer to at least a 55/45 split with the weight.

I was also suprised to see my bus weigh in at 3400lbs. No extra's, just
stock interior. What a pig!  :-)
