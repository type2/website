Subject: heat risers 1500 sp

Hi,
Pulled the engine out to replace oil cooler seals, check clutch, 
thermostat, etc.
Tried to blow through heat risers on manifold. Atheriosclerosis.
Tried clutch cable in a drill, tried metal spiral cable housing in a 
drill. Both stop right at the last bend before the horizontal heat 
exchange area. On both sides. It feels and sounds as though there were 
a metal fin inside the riser which prevents the cables from advancing 
through it.
Short of drilling/cutting through a riser to allow reamer access and 
then re-welding, what could i do to get rid of the carbon build-up?

thanks,
andres
