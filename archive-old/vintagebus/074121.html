Subject: pre 61 panel needed

guys and gals-

just joined the list, so hopefully not out line with my request.....but looking for a pre 61 double door panel, a walk thru would be a added bonus....need a decent roller, with minimal rust.

color not important, and condition of mechanicals is not important. is there is a semi restored vehicle up for grabs would be great as well. as complete as possible

please forward info, phone number, and pictures, leads etc.

bus will be restored, and used daily, it will go to a good home, VWs been in family for over 40 years

no wrecks, rust heaps, or hack jobs please

serious buyer in need
thanks guys
robert o.
