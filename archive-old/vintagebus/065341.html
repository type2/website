Subject: wiper shafts and safari's.  65 and later

Does anyone know how to properly ID the correct wiper
shaft base for a 65 and later bus with safari's?  I
thought i bought the right style but my external wiper
shaft disengaugers do not fit into the base of the
wiper arm.  How do you tell which ones are the right
ones?  I modified my repro disenguagers to work but do
not want to do the same mod to my SWF ones.

anyone have some FS?

Thanks
