Subject: Re: [VB] Question about body prep

&gt; Question . . . is his advice on the right track?  He said it would  
&gt; be about
&gt; $200-300 to have it blasted.

Curt,

The last time I checked, several years ago, a complete walnut shell  
media  sandblast on a rotisserie in our area was about $600. Probably  
more now, or less if no rotisserie?

YMMV,

Tomas
