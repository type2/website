   My '62 standard walkthrough is white over grey, the colors are original
 I believe.
 
 [Clara the VW encyclopedia broke away from her parts books long enough to 
 write]
 in 62 the two tone schemes were turquoise/blue white and sealing wax
 red/beige grey, while the one tones were I think SWR, dove blue, some sort
 of white- i think pearl white,- no Ivory  and I think also ruby red (very
 rare).
 
 Hope this helps.

Happpy Birrthaday too youuuououou!!!

ya- but I didn't check my book for this one and there aren't as many mouse
grey / white buses so like I totally spaced dude, but yea that's an original
colour too.
