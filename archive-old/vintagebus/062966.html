Subject: re:rear seat-actually middle seat

well i searched the samba classifieds and i guess this is more likely a
middle seat, as about 1/3 of the backrest flips forward - i guess to allow
passengers to the rear seat.

there was one clamp assembly on it, with the mounting support(221 883 861 A)
the clamp-with a part number 221883865A, and the screw/nut (N16 137 2, N 11
010 4)

I checked my parts manual-for the numbers, although the clamp actually has
the part number stamped in it.

although this seat does not have the grab handles on the top edge of the
seat-as per my parts manual, they are behind the seat. There is also an ash
tray in the back of the seat. these are all some type of black plastic.

the upholstery actually has two small tears in it on the back rest. the
upholstery has a basket weave type of pattern on it, the sides are smooth.
the basket weave type of stuff is a whitish vinyl, and the sides are gray.
it is a very durable upholstery. and very dirty. i just did a quick rinse of
it. there are some stains on it. and a little paint splattered one end, and
a little in the back. i think this could all be washed off with a little
more aggressive scrubbing. the basket weave pattern traps a lot of dirt.

still trying to do the picture thing.
