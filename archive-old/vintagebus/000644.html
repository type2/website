Hmmmm......
Looks like brazil to me.
Note the LH cargo doors. The outtie vents with big taillights with ribbed 
bumpers?
Im surprised those ribbed bumpers didnt have overriders, yes they did that in 
brazil too.
Not to mention the use of corner windows until the mid 70ies, yes even on 
KOMBIS!
Or yeah could be that someone was realllllllyyyy good with photoshop.
