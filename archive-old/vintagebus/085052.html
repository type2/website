Subject: Re: [VB] the dead horse to be beaten ( High oil temps on
  highway)

&gt;.  Interestingly, if the light starts to flicker and I pull off on 
&gt;the next off ramp, it goes solid as I decelerate and put in the 
&gt;clutch.


you stop blowing high-speed fan air over the motor, so the temp goes 
up. also, the motor doesn't vibrate as much, and the 'trigger' on the 
dipstick stops bouncing off of the contact point and makes a full 
connection.

fyi, the berg senders use a bimetallic spring or some such - this 
twists a little triangle of wire at the top to lleft or right 
depending on temp; when you get hot oil, the triangle starts to touch 
a metal screw, which is tied in to the dash oil light.
btw,  i put a buzzer on mine as well - i HEAR it chirp from the 
triangle JUST beginning to bounce off the screw long before the light 
goes on enough to notice.
