Subject: Re: [VB] type 1 verses 3 and 4 oil coolers
To: Ronnie_at_oldvolks_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have seen type3 coolers that have the same kind of finnage as the type 1 
coolers, perhaps they had a couple varieties.  FWIW, the sender on the type3 
cooler takes up the same place as the hoover bit air deflector, so either you 
leave the sender in and leave off the airdeflector, or you plug the sender 
and use the HBAD.  I found this out when I tried to add that bit around a 
type 3 cooler on a bus motor, and it wouldn't.

It would be interesting to do the math and figurae out the total cooling area 
for each kind.

 After looking at the 3 different oil coolers I have decided to use a type 3
 instead of the type 1 or 4. Why you wonder???  In close examiantion of the
 3,the type 3 seems like the best canditate to enhance cooling power. Same
 size as a type 1 so you won't be loosing air volume or air flow, like if you
 were using the (type 4) larger cooler, the hoover bit will still work, makes
 for better sealing, no hacking of existing sheet metal and the type 3 oil
 cooler has at least 30 per cent more cooling fins then the type 1 and would
 seem to cool oil down as good as or close to the type 4 cooler. In off road
 racing the coolers we used  have more cooling fins then they do passages
 (and these are high dollar coolers) as did Porsche,and are a lot amaller
 then the big tubed, less finned coolers, so size isn't everything, The type
 4 have 2 more rows then the type one but the same size cooling fins, whereas
 the type 3 has the same passages as the type 1 but at least 30 per cent more
 cooling fins, so I feel this would make up for the extra passages, but lack
 of extra cooling fins in the type 4 cooler. Another plus is the addition of
 a sender unit boss in it so you could hook up either a pressure or temp
 gauge, again this is my opinion but common sense seems to take hold here,
 I'll let the list know the effects of this as my 1776 single port is almost
 complete.
