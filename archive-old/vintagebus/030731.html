&gt;...I'm just saying that if you're new to VW's and/or new to buses, give
the stock configuration a try, if for no other reason than to learn the
system...  
&gt;
I'm reminded of something someone said to me last weekend - They asked me
how fast I drive my Kombi and I said &quot;50 mph usually, sometimes 55, whatever
it feels like going.&quot;  His reply was &quot;I like to drive slow too, it gives
the other people on the road longer to see my Bus.&quot;

I like that.
