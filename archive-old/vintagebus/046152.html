&lt;&lt; Out of curiosity, do early model year 67 busses have 6v or 12v? &gt;&gt;

Hi,
Well here below is what we found in our type 2 parts book. 

M 620   12 volt system 
(M 620 - standard equipment from 1st Aug. 1966)

So the 1967 model year was 12 volt.  Unless there were some special order 
buses just before which would have slowed them and made them come out just 
after the model change, or afterward as special order for 6 volt.  Eric&amp;Barb
