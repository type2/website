&gt;
&gt; Considering that most of the electricity that would charge the battery in
&gt; a Lead/Acid EV is generated by coal, fuel oil or GASP atomic energy aren't
&gt; they really just adding additional energy overhead and shifting the
&gt; location of the pollution? &lt;snip&gt;

The additional pollution generated, even with a coal fired plant, is
significantly less than what was coming out of the tail pipe of the 1966
vehicle.  You could compare the difference with a newer cleaner car, but
would still need to factor in the pollution created to manufacture the new
car and the pollution created in the drilling and refining of the fuel plus
the shipping via oil tanker and truck to the gas station.  Then there is the
whole wars over oil scenario, but thats a whole other story.  Ideally, solar
panels on the roof of my garage would feed the power grid during the day
when I'm at work and I would take the power back from the grid at night to
produce a net of 0 pollution
