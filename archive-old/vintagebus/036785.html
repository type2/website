Subject: POR-15 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm a dealer in my area for por-15,but i used it for over 5 years before 
getting the dealer ship. I first used it on a 62 Hatch Top Westy for Danny 
Morganelli from Wrightville Beach NC. I used the stuff at Danny's request, it 
was awesome ,he daily drove the bus until it was lost to fire in 98 tink ,the 
hulk in my back yard still has no rust on the treated areas except where the 
fire damage the top gutter rail ,,the front area of the gutter and the bottom 
which were not affected by the fire are still just the way they were NO rust 
,,i applied the por on the bus in 1995 .. They have many different types of 
por the chassis coat black or something like that might be better for drums 
,,visit the web site www.por-15_dot_com for more details or p-mail me i'll help 
any way i can ,,later
