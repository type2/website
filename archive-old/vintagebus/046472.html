&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 Just wondering about sprung push rod tubes.  Are these any worse than
 regular push rod tubes?  I've seen plastic and metal versions, and I'd
 opt for the metal ones, but maybe the plastic ones are better?  It seems
 like these would be better for faster oil leak repairs be it roadside or
 in the garage.  Its a real pain in the rear having to pull the motor,
 and all the tin and head to replace a pushrod tube or seal.
 What do you guys think?
  &gt;&gt;


I like to carry a couple two part push rod tubes and some push rod tube seals 
in my repair kit.    A couple times I have used them- great for doing repairs 
when there is a crack in a push rod tube or the seal is leaking, yoou can 
pull the valve cover and the rocker arm and remove the push rod, then yank 
the old push rod tube pout with a pair of pliers, install the replacement, 
put the push rods back, in go the rocker arms, on with the vlave cover, 
voila, so much easier than removing the head, just check the valve adjustment 
again in a hundred miles or so.  I haven't bothered installing on a motor 
when buildt, just as a time saving repair.
