Subject: RE: [VB] Choke n me out!

Adrian,

Sounds to me like your choke is adjusted all of the way shut, meaning no
air. Thus no spark, no fire.  I used to be a devout &quot;no choke&quot; kind of guy,
but my mechanic steered me toward the other way(This is for a stock carb
right?).  I now run a Progressive with no choke(Just because I haven't
looked into the correct way to set it up), but when I had the stock carb, I
followed these steps:

Check to see if the choke is all the way closed when the engine is cold.

1. make sure the power is connected correctly
2. With the engine cool, take off the air cleaner, and loosen the choke hold
down screws(3).
3. I believe there is a notch in the white choke body that needs to be lined
up with a hash mark on the &quot;hold-down&quot; ring.

This forces the choke to close at a certain amount, until the engine warms
up and makes an internal spring inside the choke mechanism to grow, opening
the choke.

I can get more specific when I get home, and take a look at my stock engine.

 - Hope this helps.

Subject: [VB] Choke n me out!


Here is a very odd choke problem I would appreciate some assistance with...

When the vehicle is cold and the choke power wire attached it will not
start.  Pull the choke power wire off and it will fire up and run instantly.
Reattach the choke power wire and it runs fine like normal.

I am stumped as to why this would happen?

Right now I am leaning towards just disabling the choke altogether like St
Muir advises :)   I am not sure if this would affect drivability that much?


Thanks,
