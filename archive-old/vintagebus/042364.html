hi all,

I have just brought home a new-to-me bus.  It is a 1961 standard and it is
complete except for a couple of broken popouts and 2 missing popout
latches... and of course there are no rear seats, hehe.

It has a lot of surface rust but thankfully there is little rot.  Just a
couple of places in the rockers... of course.  Original paint, never
restored previously.  Parked in 84 after engine troubles and not run or
worked on since... think i'll need to do a little greasing and repairing,
heh.

It really is informative to see a bus that is just beginning to rust, you
figure out the weak spots that the rust starts at so you can protect
another bus if its rust free from ever starting to rust, or watch/fix teh
problem areas on yours after you repair it so it doesnt rust again.  Once
a bus is too far gone its hard to tell where the cancer started, at least
IMHO.

What seems to happen to the rockers is that dirt and mud collect in the
little lips between the end of the rocker and the wheelwhell, theres a
shelf there.  Once a hole rusts there then the water gets into the rockers
and goes from there.  the outriggers (jackpoint??) are open to the rockers
so once the water gets in the rocker, it flows down the outriggers and
they will go next.  

So, clean that mud out of your wheelwells and patch holes that let
wheelwell water into your rockers at least!

thankfully my holes are no bigger than a golf ball and the inner rockers,
jackpoints and outriggers are all rock solid... as are the window lips,
nose, corners etc.

I have a lot of work cut out for me, but i'm excited to begin playing with
my new bus.

I hope to get around to actually making a website with pix of my various
projects, when i do i'll let y'all know for sure...

gotta update my sig :)

peas,

Steve
