Subject: Dent in Roof, Headliner Q followup
Date: Mon, 3 Aug 1998 07:58:39 -0700 

Thanks for the various replies and suggestions on 
how to pull the dent and how the headliner is attached.

After looking more closely at the situation, I started
playing with the headliner.  The dent was too big to
be able to use a suction cup.  

I peeled back the aft edge of the headliner from it's
contact cement glued in location.  I ended up peeling
back about 16 inches.

I was just able to get a foot into the space between
the edge of the roof and the torsion bars for the rear
hatch.  I was able to pus the dent a little, but not enough,
so I brought out the bigger hammer.

Artisans of sheet metal and those familiar with how one
is supposed to do this task, might look away for a few
lines.

I used a wood block slightly curved and the head of an
old sledge hammer and pounded out the dent to the
degree I wanted.

The bottom edge of the rear hatch frame was bowed down
slightly due to the roof dent, making opening the rear 
hatch difficult, as it rode against the drip rail.

It was a nice hot day out there, and the contact cement
was still sufficiently tacky to allow me to re-attach the
headliner with no problem.  Trying to get pressure up, 
down, and over the edge of the attachment proved difficult.
I used a dental tool with that odd bent/curved shape to
reach around and apply some force to the glue joint.
It worked well, and is a tool I usually have in my box.

One of these days I'll make the dent a lot nicer, but for
now it's not posing any problems.

I cleaned up the final remains of the broken glass on the 
rear deck.  Black carpet is a real pain, every little bit of 
stuff shows against that color.

Ice coming off a roof hit the rear end, causing dent and
breaking glass.  I bought it this way, so it didn't happen to me,
directly.
