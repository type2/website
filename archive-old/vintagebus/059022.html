I have some Hella H4 headlights made in Germany in my '74 Thing and they are
a direct replacement for the 7&quot; sealed beam headlights.  You should consider
adding relays and better wiring to get the full benefit from these lights.
Another good idea, but a non issue for a split, is to add a protective film
cover as genuine Hella H4s are pricey.  I plan on adding some to my '65
soon.

Interesting question that I have wondered over the years as well...

Will the H4 halogen kits drop into the bus/beetle headlight housings?

From what I have seen the el cheapos (about $25 each) are made in India, but
seem to be okay quality.  They drop into a lot of Porsche cars quite easily.
Automobile Atlanta always has them on display in their showroom...  Granted
I do not encourage anyone to patron that shop, so do not take my being there
as a plug for the joint.

So anyone dropped these in their bus or what?  Seems like a logical easy
upgrade to me!
