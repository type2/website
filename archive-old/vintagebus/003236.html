All,
    2 cents worth,.
    I have had the no sender problem due to PO retrofitting the older style
tank. Deadset the amount of aggravation involved in the conversion convinced
me to go to the wrecking yard and buy the right tank, sender and all and
bolt it straight in. The sender worked just fine and the whole deal cost me
$30.00.
