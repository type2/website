Subject: VW weekend/New Westie!! Part II
Message-ID: &lt;3B396760_at_webmail&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

Sorry, I hit Send too prematurely in my previous message.
There are a couple more issues I wanted to mention:
1- I noticed a huge amount of VWs buses, Vanagons and Eurovans (Westfalias or 
not)in the Seattle area and south on I-5. I am talking LOTS! I am not sure if 
it is always that way in WA, but it was very refreshing. And this cannot be 
exclusively due to the VW events this weekend, since I saw dozens of them 
heading north on I-5 today (too late for any show) and wondering through 
Seattle. Spotted lots of splitties. Seattle felt like a giant Eugene, in terms 
of VW bus population/bus ratio.
2- I got the following update from Susan's Alaskan adventure, for anyone 
interested. I will upload her photos to the WW's site.
&gt;do not reply to this address make sure it goes to susan_at_ cellair.  my mom
&gt;forwarded your last message a new skill for her!!! but i
&gt;got it.  i have been having trouble sending from Canada so no messages for 
2-3 &gt;weeks. now I am using outlook to send messages
&gt;and it seems to work.  I will enclose a couple of pictures for you to put
&gt;somewhere.  I got a digital camera and one of the cool
&gt;features it does is &quot;stitch&quot;
&gt;pictures together. so you take 2-? PANORAMA  shots then when I download it to
&gt;the computer it sews them together for a big
&gt;picture.  great way to take the pictures I used to not take because they
&gt;wouldn't fit in one screen.
&gt;not a lot of people here at all.  the main Alaska highway has plenty of motor
&gt;homes.  hardly any vws anymore not even
&gt;eurovans.have only passed about 6 vanagons and 3 eurovans and 5-6 like mine.
&gt;absolutely no splits! there was a picture of one in
&gt;the keno city museum.
&gt;i am writing this in several days so excuse me if it doesn't make sense.  am 
in &gt;whitehorse fixing to leave for haines junction and
&gt;haines today but first have to go back to the junkyard we were at last night.
&gt;they are going to crush the 4 bubble windows they have
&gt;and there are a few more parts we'd like. nothing fancy but i can fix my 
broken &gt;light pieces.  got a handle and there was a 78 westy
&gt;camped in our campground last night. new to vws 2 years older folks but they
&gt;are going to go get some lenses too! they are from
&gt;the ottowa valley in ontario. actually have traveled about as far as we have.
 &gt;there was also a bus identical in color but a westy to
&gt;mine in watson lake and they had a canoe.  i should have brought mine.  oh 
well &gt;next time.
Later,
Cris
Eugene, OR
'91 Westie &quot;Fafner&quot;

'66 Velvet Green Westie (as of today!)
