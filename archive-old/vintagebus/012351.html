&gt;&gt; Yes, the BG on top of the SWR, you can see it where the Beige Grey 
has worn
&gt;&gt; off in places on the roof.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My 1965 Westy two tone was painted the same way.
&gt;
&gt;My '65 Deluxe was also painted on the bottom first and then on top. I
&gt;have a lot of SWR showing where the BG has worn off on my roof. Maybe
&gt;they changed their minds at VW about how to paint a bus again sometime
&gt;after Clara's bus was painted. Maybe some of you '62 - '64 owners can
&gt;fill us in.

FYI   My 62 deluxe was painted the turquoise (bottom color) all over 
then the Blue white (top color) was put on top .
