There is one produced jointly by NEATO, SSVC and Bulli
Kartei showing some of the different factory and
non-factory conversions done on Splittys, e.g. fire
truck, Cinema projection van etc.

I picked mine from a SSVC stall at a meet a while ago,
and just checked the web-page but there's no reference
there, so I guess NEATO would be the next best
bet...tho I know they were limited numbers.

The bus has just failed it's MOT - but only on a leaky
wheel cylinder and front wheel bearing...phew! I can
afford to have presents under the tree and food on the
table this Christmas! 

Cheers
Chris
