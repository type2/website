I was there with my camera and my '60 Double Cab.  Not too many shows Buses,
there may have been more Buses swapping, which I think someone mentioned.
 I didn't buy much, I guess my notable purchase of the day could be considered
the complete and nice 010 Bus distributor for $25.  I found another early
Bus jack, I've been buying all the different styles I see until I figure
out 100% which one is &quot;correct&quot; for my Barndoor.  Anyone?

I uploaded most of the pics to the Gallery on my site - check 'em out.

On the way home, my Double Cab stalled and would not crank over 2 blocks
from my house.  After a quick push into the Quickie Mart, I went to check
out the battery cables.  I had noticed the positive battery cable had some
sort of weird quick disconnect in-line a while back and when I touched that
junction, it was HOT.

It wouldn't crank over after a few minutes and the cable was still hot so
I gave it a little push-start and drove home.

Both battery cables are kinda screwed up, time for new cables.
