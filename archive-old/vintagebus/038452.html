Eric,

When I go to install my 1998 Mexican longblock into my '63 Truck, I should
remove the pressed-in nut from the case and revert to the washer and bolt?

I liked the pressed in nut, a lot easier to install the bolt not having to
hold both ends at the same time (somehow being under engine and behind bus
at the same time). :)

P.S.  (Todd Hill -- can you comment on this too?)

&lt;&lt; I guess this is because the nut in there behind the fan is such a
 PITA &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike that should read &quot;in front of the fan shroud&quot;.  This type of pressed
in nut is for the doghouse cooler fan shroud that was stock for 1971 and
later
type1&amp;2 upright engines.  With this set up came a straight clutch release
arm
that the rear end of the clutch cable went through.  The previous arm was
curved toward the tranny and did not allow access to the head of the upper
left engine mounting bolt head which is why the arm was changed to a
straight.
If you have a 1970 and earlier VW that you want to install a doghouse
cooling
system, you can leave off the last two cooling tin pieces from the  exaust
side of the oil cooler and install them after the engine is in and the upper
left nut in is in place.  Also if you are intalling a 1971 and later upright
engine case in a earlier VW you can install a bolt in the pressed in nut and
hammer out the pressed in nut toward the rear so one can use a normal nut
with
a washer instead.  The reason not to use the pressed in nut in a 1970 and
earlier VW is that you would not only have to install the straight clutch
release arm but the left tranny side plate would have to be changed at the
same time.  To keep the end of the boden tube pointed at the clutch arm to
prevent the clutch cable from rubbing on the tip of the boden tube and
wearing
out prematurely at 10,000 or less miles.  Also there was not only one
straight
clutch release arm, but another later model of the arm even longer and this
to
has it's own different side plate to insure that the rear end of the boden
tube is pointed properly.  Eric &amp; Barb
