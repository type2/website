You're luckier than I am; I tried for 2 years to get some of that stuff
for the '54, and came up empty-handed.  And that was for a bus I wasn't
pretending to sell!

Maybe I should post a request to the list once a week - seems to work for
some people...

&gt; Yes but read the lines, The ad did get your attention and I have allready
&gt; been offered the parts I need to repair and complete it off the ad. The bus
&gt; isn't for sale. Now the 59 single cab in the ad is, I need the money from it
&gt; to help me get going on the BD. The high price would scare anyone away after
&gt; looking at the pictures. So if you need parts put Barndoor for sale and
&gt; everyone reads the ad. I have been offered the following parts so far.
