Subject: Re: [VB] Where theres smoke...      

Some VWs did not come with heater boxes, like the things, hm.  They have gas 
heaters and fan housings with no fresh air outlet I believe.   But there is 
something different about the tin above the push rod tubes.   I am kind of 
vague on this stuff, but I know the tin between push rod tubes and cylinders 
is different, and that is supposed to be important.  What kind of tin do you 
have there?

300*F is pretty hot though.

 This discussion made me wonder, does having heater boxes
 help cooling?  Significantly?  I have no heater boxes,
 and my fan outlets are blocked off, rear tin holes sealed.
 One thing that definitely comes to mind is that without
 heaters, there is no lower tin.
 
 My oil temp routinely reaches 250, and has hit the 300 mark,
 but there doesn't appear to be much to do about it.  I wish 
 I could make myself believe in the vent cowlings enough to 
 try them.  Apologies if we've already discussed that to death.
