&gt;&gt;  Any secrets on removing the vent glass?  I saw in  the Bentley that VW 
had a
jig for this.  The right one am out, but the  left is stubborn.  &lt;&lt;
Hi Brooksdj,
If it is a tempered piece of glass and not the Sigla laminated stuff we  
gently work with a slot tip screw driver at the ends of the frame to loosen the  
glass from the seal.  Then work the glass out the reat of the  way by hand.
 
&gt;&gt; Also: What does everyone, who's replaced the catch, use to  attach the new 
one? &lt;&lt;


Do you mean the wing window latch??  If so solid rivets.
