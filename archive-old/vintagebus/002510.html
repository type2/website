Subject: More 67 bus electricals

Tonight I went and visted the grandparents so I got a later start.  I worked
from about 9:00 until now (12:45) on the 67 bus.  I got some more electrical
stuff fixed.  I blew 2 fuses before I found out I had the wiper motor wired
up wrong but it works fine now.  The antenna was moved over from the 66 as
well as the windshield squirter nozzles and wiper motor shaft rubbers.  The
front dome light power connection had corroded so I pulled the rear one out
of the 66 and swapped it over.  I also moved over my dome light switch that
goes on the steering pod.  I then installed the non-working 12v radio just
for looks.  I didn't hook anything up for power - just wire tied it all up.
I've pulled that nice little 6v Sapphire unit out of the 66 and am going to
run that for my AM radio fix in the 67.  I figure it can sit in the parcel
tray or I'll hang it underneath - not sure yet but I definitely have fallen
in love with that little radio. :-)  I'm going to be running an MP3 player
in this bus from www.mp3kit_dot_com so all I'll need is something with FM.  I
know it's a rare beast but I would really love a 67 AM/FM radio that works
OR better yet (but not necessary) one with SWL capabilities. :-)  I simply
refuse to hack the dash of the 67 (or cut fender wells for that matter.)  I
put the clock in the dash but didn't fasten it in yet as I need to find the
voltadrop in order to run it.  The original 12v clock has a snapped off
power terminal on the back and besides, Eric&amp;Barb did a full blown tune up
on my 6v clock to make sure it was good for another 20 years or more. :-)
Today I went and got a month's worth of liability insurance so I can get
tags and plates and keep the city off of my back.  I also cleaned up the
wiper arms and fastened them to the wiper motor shafts.  Tomorrow (well I
guess later today seeings as how it is early Thursday morning as I post
this) I'll hit up the local Autozone and ask for VW bus wiper blades.  Then
I'll ask for old Jeep blades and see what happens.

That was about all I could hack...

As an added bonus, today when I drove by my house while out on deliveries, I
caught a rare glimpse of the partially homebound neighbor who likes to call
me in to the police.  He was standing out on his front porch checking his
mail..............in his underwear and a t-shirt.  I made sure I drove
slowly in front of house (enough to attract attention) while waving and
smiling.  He saw me and just stood there and stared. :-)  Would this be
considered indecent exposure?   Geesh...  At least he's got clothes on - the
old coot.

Anyway, one more point I might add - as I'm doing this work on the bus, I'm
thinking about the shows and places I'll be able to attend.  Just thinking
of the Omaha show where I'll meet up with Rob Laffoon and Terry Wolfe (my
bus looks like his except his body work is primo and his bus is a 65 Westy)
in my very own splitty is enough to make me sit there and smile.  I've got
this picture of all 3 of us with our buses parked really close together and
just hanging out like we always do - it must makes it seem all worth it.

Enough jabber - later!
