renoir here.


I am finally doing something about the outer clack, clack,clack in my cv
joints, 71 van.

If i replace the whole half shaft complete with joints and boots from a
69, does it matter if i hook up to inner or outer?
In other words, i cannot remember which side or tranny or wheel the
replacement shafts were located.

Advice is appreciated.
thanks
