Subject: [VB] single cab bumpers
Message-ID: &lt;0.91851ae0.25998269_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Thanks to all who responded to my questions &quot;single cab authenticity.&quot;  Re 
bumpers (all U.S. style with overriders and towel bars), I checked my 
catalogues, and came up with the following:

Wolfsburg West--front $305.50, rear $272.00

California Imports--front $259.95, rear $249.95.  Plus a $6.95 bolt kit, each 

Rocky Mountain -- front $315, rear $314.95

Surely at these prices, they are not &quot;cheap Brazilian??&quot;  This is the price 
range for the best of Beetle repops, with good chrome.

Question:  Are these all the same bumpers, suppliers buying from the same 
source, or is one definitely superior to the rest?  Any others I missed?
