Today I fired up the pickup and cut firewood.   Didn't take any pictures, but
the bed had a bunch o chunks of cedar.  Don't worry, there's more to get.
Then I filled up the back of the truck with branches and went to the dump (on
the way to the pub).  Dump guy says'you don't see a lot of these'   &quot;but i saw
another earlier today'   Guess they come out of the woodwork now and again-
sunny day, take truck to dump.

I'd like to hear the entertaining responses you give to these questions!

&gt; &quot;No one would steal it - it's a VW Bus!&quot;
&gt; &quot;Is this a 21-window?&quot;
&gt; &quot;I can't believe you drive this thing.  Why don't you get a normal car?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Isn't it dangerous to drive it on the highway?&quot;
