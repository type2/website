Subject: stainless rockers

I recall someone on the list was either instatlling stainless rockers or
already had. I would like to know the consensus on this. First of all,
are they commercially available?? Second of all, are they worth the
trouble. I know that even stainless will rust, that it just rusts at a
slower rate.And thirdly, is the dimetalic effect a problem here?? Or is
it only a problem between surfaces that have not been welded??
