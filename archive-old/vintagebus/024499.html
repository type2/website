Subject: M codes....

    While looking thru the Bentley reprint of the '63-'67 Transporter
Workshop manual this morning I came across a slight discrepancy.

    According to the Bentley M-code 172 used in conjuction with M-code
215 or 216 (1500 cc engine) is for the speed limiter .

    Original VW Bus says M-code #172 &quot;Visible location of Brake fluid
reservoir&quot;

    Could it be that some of the &quot;missing&quot; m-codes are for certain rare
engine/tranny/interior configurations..??

    I'm still trying to find out information on M-code #360...

    This is listed on my '63 Standard Microbus (with M-codes for:
12V,1500cc engine, locking steering/ignition, walk-thru, US sealed
beams/red taillight lenses).

    Bentley is an exact reprint of the Original VW manual, right...??

    I've been told that my air cleaner setup is incorrect (goes to the
right side), but Bentley says it is correct for 1500 sp equipped
Microbusses with Aux. gas heaters (which mine originally was, but heater
unit is MIA w/ducting still in place).

    Can anyone out there confirm which book is correct...

            TIA...
