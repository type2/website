Subject: RE: Getting dissy trying to figure out the dizzys!

Thanks to a helpful reminder from Jim!  The information is available from
Old Volks Home.


&gt; In theory I think when timed at 7.5 BTDC w/o vacuum the with vacuum timing
should be around 10 BTDC and when revved at 3500RPM should come out to 30-32
degrees   BTDC....? 

From www.oldvolkshome_dot_com :
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC Static or _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe and vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 24-28deg
_at_ 3.2 In. Hg 

&gt;  
&gt; In an effort to clean this problem up I have a 30-PICT-3 I will rebuild
(matches 205 dizzy from VW installations) and hopefully the vacuum from the
carb will be correct..?

Have to still check on the carb situation though. 


&gt; Thanks,
