Subject: Re: [T2] oil relief plug removal help

If this plug is the same sort of thing that's on a Vanagon engine here's the
&quot;tool&quot; that I made for the job:

Went down to Ace Hardware and got a 3-foot length of 1&quot; wide mild &quot;weldable
steel.&quot;  It's a flat bar whose thickness is almost exactly the width of the
slot.
Cut off about a foot of the bar.
Radiused the end of the 1 foot length of bar to fit the slot in the plug.
(The slot is mildly crescent-shaped so a &quot;square&quot; end won't fit properly.)

Using one hand pushing on the square end of the tool and the other hand on a
crescent wrench right up near the radiused end, these things come out
easily.

&gt; Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest
&gt; impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered
&gt; some damage as well.  The thing will not move! (even though it is
&gt; covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.
