on all the 67 deluxes that I have seen with original interior panels there
is one panel on each side of the &quot;tire bulge&quot; and another panel in the
center with some trim on it and it goes around the bulge area. this making 3
panels in all, plus another panel on top of the bulge area panel made of
formed metal and topped off with some board material and a rubber edging on
it. the 3 large panels had some thin aluminum trim on them that ran accross
them. I will try to see if I have some pics and p-mail them to you. This is
just what I have seen I hope it helps.

&gt; like the catalog) I see that there are two panels that cover this area
&gt; originally.  Does this mean that the &quot;tire-bulge&quot; is left uncovered and
just
&gt; painted pearl white?
&gt; Thanks for all your help guys,
