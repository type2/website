Subject: Restoration
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 1967 camper and am looking to get some restoration done to it. It 
needs some limited body work and is in desperate need of a paint job. I am 
looking for someone to recommend a reputable shop/person in the greater 
cleveland area to do this work for me. Any leads would be appreciated
