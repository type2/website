One of the first steps in the process is an acid bath
to clean and etch the wheels.  Your aluminum wheels 
wouldn't survive the bath.

Perhaps you should consider getting them polished instead;
a good polishing job is almost as bright as chrome, but
is more subtle.  Me, personally, I think chromed Fuchs
look a bit too &quot;matchbox&quot;

&gt; that. I've seen these types of wheels chromed before,
