Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky tranny

yes, the transmission is filled with heavy gear oil (GL-4).  It smells awful, 
but oil is it.

If it is leaking from the boots, look at it- grab yr flashlight and watch cap 
and shimmy under there.  some times you can turn the screws on the clamps and 
get them to stop dripping.  If the boots had torn or cracked they need 
replacing.  Some of the rubber is like that.  If the seam screws are too 
loose, or too tight, it can ooze from there, or if there is a gap at the seam 
at the clamp.  

Recently I replaced a boot and I simply loved the new boot.  It had a 211 p/n 
and fit the later tube (larger than the bug version/63 and earlier tube) and 
the rubber was supple.   I oughta post that brand, I kept the wrapper.   Why 
there are so many cruddy ones made I do not understand.  The \X/ CCCO ones 
are too stiff, I don't like those.

ya, top up the tranny oil after sorting the boot out.

&lt;&lt; Hey there all,
 
 My transmission (1965 Type II) has recently begun to drip quite a lot of 
gear 
 oil from the boots.  I thought there was only grease in there!  I had the 
 original style boots replaced about year ago with the bolt on kind, are they 
 junk or OK?  The tranny was 're-sealed' about three years ago and when I 
 bought it about a year and half ago I found the tranny overfilled with 90 
wt. 
  I let some out and have had no other troubles since, until recently.  
What's 
 up with gear oil in the boots?  Are we talkin' major repairs?  
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Arthur
