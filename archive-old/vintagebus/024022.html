Subject: Re: Como Green Interior

Doug Donlinger in Phoenix Az. area is repoducing this color for all of
his 23 window projects. He found the corect green and had the cross
lines silk screened on and it looks great. I have he pnumber someplace
but can't find it now. Ellis or someone else in the Phoenix Az. area
must have it. If I can find the number will post it. I do know he will
be at Jerome 8.
