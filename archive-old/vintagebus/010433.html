Hey Volks

Some of you may remember my shortlived entry in the 2000 Africa Beetle Rally
in July.

I totally cooked a newly built counterweighted engine soon after the start.
I then fitted a VWSA factory rebuilt engine, which had a 0.5mm oversize boss
on the pulley, no doubt through having been align bored to hell. This engine
developed serious end float on the crank within 1000km, accompanied by
chunks of white metal in the oil.

Firstly the counterweighted motor. The guy who built it for me stripped the
carcass, which clearly started overheating on #4 piston, which led to the
piston burning and the main bearings pinching on the crank. Luckily the case
and c/w crank are undamaged so the engine is rebuildable.

It looks like the overheat was caused by running too lean. The carb was
already jetted too lean at home, 6 000 feet above sea level, but when we got
to the start of the rally at sea level it was just too much. But luckily for
me the builder has agreed to go halves with me on the rebuild as one of the
pistons had a chunk missing out of the skirt which was not inside the
engine -- it could only have happened on assembly!

And as for the end-floaty VWSA engine. After a long telephone correspondence
with the ops manager of the subcontractors who build the &quot;factory&quot; engines,
they have agreed to replace it under guarantee with a new engine built on a
case that has not been align bored more than once.

So, with any luck I'll have two good new engines before Christmas.
