Subject: FS: Dormobile top and all parts, Portland OR

Hello,

I have a pretty nice dormobile top , all hardware including frame, hinges,
cots, and accordion pieces, two sets of canvas, one very usable, the other
could be a pattern or resewn. I also have a set of new vents, the really
nice reproductions made by Susan (Crandall) Dolvin.

I had every intention of putting this top into my 65 kombi, but have not had
the nerve to cut the top, nor the time or space to begin such a project.


As far as I can tell the unit is complete. The top needs very very minor
fiberglass repair, but could be used and be fully functional without doing a
thing to it. I was planning to drop it at a body shop for the repair and a
new coat of paint. That would be my recommendation.

The one thing that would be needed as far as parts, is a new pop-top seal.
I've ben told that the waterbuffalo top seal works well on these.

I have roughgly $400 into these parts, and will unload them for that amount
to a good home. This top fits a split. I don't have the part that allows it
to be used on a bay, so if you want it, you should have a splitscreen to put
it on.


Respond to me off-list,
Jack Maynard
