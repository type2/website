Hi Greg,

They meant the fuel hoses from the tank, to the metal line that goes through
the firewall,to the fuel pump and ultimately to the carb.

The joints at all of these places should be hose clamped. It is a hell of a
good idea to check the condition of the hoses frequently as a leak in the
engine bay can easily result in a burned out bus. 

The fuel attacks the rubber of the hoses and it seems that the ordinary
stuff that one buys at the spares store doesn't last for more than a year. 

I'd suggest that while you are checking those clamps that you just go head
and replace the hoses. It's very cheap fire insurance.

BTW the metal line that comes through the fire wall must be protected from
the metal of the hole that it passes through or it will wear thin at the
point of contact and eventually split. If the grommet that would have been
in the hole is missing or incomplete split a length of the hose and slip it
over the metal line at the point at which it passes through the fire wall. 

Take it easy and have fun with your bus.

Michael
