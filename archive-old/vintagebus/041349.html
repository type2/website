Hey Now

    The rainy season has hit the PNW so I'm not doin' much work on the bus
but I'm tryin' to build up some capitol to put into it.  I know for a fact
that I need to get my frame blasted, top priority, asap. All the rest of
the body ok for my standards. Being that it has a sunroof and has belly
pans(already on) I was wondering what my options were to get it blasted?
Basically, the guy I'd go to is about 8 miles away in the next town over.
I know the pans are there for a purpose, I was wondering what effect
it would have if I could cut them out(so we can blast the frame and
whatnot) and then driver over, get the job done, and come back, por15(or
other neat options) and then toss'em back on? Would it
buckle? It is to big of a risk?  Any other ideas?    
thanks much!!
