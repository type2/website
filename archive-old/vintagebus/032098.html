&lt;&lt; Yes, these canopies look great, I'd go for it, but I also need all the bars
to hold it up (the canopy looks pretty silly lying there in the bed without
em.)  Does anyone have plans, or measurements I could use to have a set made
or know a replica maker?

Hi Dug,
You are going to have to find the four bows for the truck at swap meets or one
of the VW restoration part shops.  As for the wood pieces PLF can supply you
with the length measurements for these and we have the other two measurements.
Do not wait too long.  Dawn says she does not like doing the tops for trucks
due to difficulty of manufacture.  So she might stop making them.  Which would
be a shame.   Eric &amp; Barb
