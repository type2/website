Just a note on the doc project...smack &quot;delete&quot; if you're not interested!

Some of the PDFs are OK, at least they open and seem to be working.  These are
sections 1-6 and 0 of the 58-67 manual, and the 1969 Without Guesswork manual.
For the time being, these are hosted at http://www.failsure_dot_net.  It may be 
some time before the repaired files are available.  

Besides the PDF problems, there's other stuff I'd like to do with the project.
First, I could use some help with maintenance :-)  I barely have enough time to
pull things offline, much less the other stuff I'd like to do that would help
users and whoever winds up hosting the files this time around.  Anyone
interested?  If not it'll just be a while.  Probably the first thing would be
to...

Make an index of some kind, or at least a better table of contents.  People may
not need all the PDFs, or even a whole one: just a few pages perhaps.  Nothing
fancy, plain text will do.

Convert the GIFs to PNG to lower by one the companies that can sue me for 
infringing on various things.  In the process make file names more computer
friendly (eg: 1.png = 001.png).

Make available post-script files for printing (maybe).

Scan that early workshop manual everyone was talking about a couple days ago.
Was there ever a real consensus on whether that would be cool (inasmuch as 
having copyrighted-but-unpublished stuff online is cool)?  I've been off the 
list for a few days.
