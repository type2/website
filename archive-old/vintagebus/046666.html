Hey listees,
 Does anyone know of a supplier of good used front windshield glass? I
craked both of mine last year trying to put new seals in :( Sort of feel like
an idiot for that, but the magazine I was using for pointers said to &quot;sit on
the front seat and push on the glass with your feet&quot;. They made a horrible
noise when they cracked, but it didn't sound like $150/pair plus an
additional &quot;crating fee&quot; worth! That price is out of the Motorworks catalog,
and I have no comparison of what they should cost. Since I live in the frosty
northwoods, finding a splitty in a junkyard is nearly impossible. Thanks in
advance...

you can get glass cut at a local automotive glass place.  If you have a
cracked one as a template.   Next time take a curved knife and cut the rubber
weatherstripping away.  hold the blade parrallell to the glass, and on the
outsid eof the bus cut the rubber from ext to the glass all the way around.
gentley push the glass out (have a friend handle so th windsheilds doesnt
fall forward.   Pull the rubber strip into the inside of the bus.   there
maybe be a bit holding somewhere so doublecheck cut more if needed.  Safety
laminated glass breaks easily as you found out.

in the meantime, clean all the rust off the window ledge, weld if needed .
spot putty if needed.   paint it.  make a perfectly smooth rust free painted
surface.     new seals wont seal on rough rusty surfaces.


when reinstalling, put the seal on the glass, and  a piece of string in the
part of the seal that will fit into the body.    overlap the ends.   place
the windsheild on the bus, push to start it seating.   flat hands, gentley
