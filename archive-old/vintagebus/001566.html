I just came back from a little test drive in the 67 bus.  I figured it
wouldn't hurt to do a little tuneup.  I'm not worried about the valves as
they were okay 900 miles ago so I'm not too worried about anything being
radically out of whack.

First off, I covered the hole for the preheat hose.  I had failed to cover
this before so I found a can whose size was mildly larger than the hole.  I
grabbed a leftover tin shingle from 1997's roofing job and cut me a circle.
After drilling a couple of holes, I had that plug securely covering the
preheat hole.

I hooked up my digital engine multimeter (I love that thing!) and found my
dwell was 39.1 and steady.  I popped the cap and rotor and sure enough, the
gap was just a bit tight for the .016 feeler guage so after opening it up, I
had a dwell of 48 even which is great because for a used set of points 42 to
56 is acceptible or something close to that according to the T1 Bentley
manual.

Next I flipped the meter over to RPM's and grabbed a piece of bailing wire.
I popped open the decklid of the 74 Super and used a piece of bailing wire
to measure from TDC over to 30 degrees (it's got one of those pulley's on
it.)  After cutting to the precise length, I marked where this was on the
stock pulley of the bus using a piece of white chalk.  I hooked up the
timing light and fired up the bus and soon found out that I was running
about 35 to 38 degrees advance on a 009 _at_ 3000+rpm's.  I definitely put her
back down to the 30 degree mark and tweaked the carb a little bit. Now she
purrs ever so gently and it's much more driveable than it was before.

I'm really confident now that with my Porsche pulley on the way and the
tuneup and deep sump I've installed, I'm not going to have any overheating
problems even with 90 degree weather predicted.  I'm going to try not to
drive like I'm in a hurry and just relax and see what happens.  This is what
I call my first major road trip in the bus (200 miles) well out of the range
of a quick rescue from family and friends so I hope everything goes well.  I
was hoping that my bus boys steering box would have arrived by now but of
course it hasn't even though they were in stock and would be sent out right
away.  I just love those blatant lies you are fed when you order stuff.  All
they gotta do is tell the truth - it ain't that hard.
