For some reason Rex, my server refused to accept your email addy.  I just
wanted to say good job and thanks for persuing this!  Even if you don't
remember what van rendered what seal, maybe you could get a list of what
vans you did plaigerize (sp?) and we could research it on our own.  I like
the idea of using some seals like this so that maybe I won't have to sell my
rotten WW safari's after all.
