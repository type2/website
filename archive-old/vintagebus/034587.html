Hi bussers,

All this talk about gear oil, it's about time I bit the bullet and changed
mine. My book says use SAE90 oil, but all I can find in the shops is 90LS
(limited slip, I guess) and 80W90. Will the 90LS be a problem?

What about these magic additives (like teflon et al.). I'm sure there are
religious wars over whether they work or not, but my question is: will they
actually HARM the tranny and/or redux boxes?

Keep on bussin,

I use the staylube 80/90 weight stuff, and buy it in the gallon containers.
but If I know the gear oil has been changed and has flushed out the crud,
I'll put the slick 50 gear oil in there- seems to make it quieter.  costs
more, i think it's worth it
