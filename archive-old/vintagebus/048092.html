&gt; I have the CE safaris and like them.  Greg Noble/Frankie Hill
&gt;  also bought a set.  Your best bet is to get up a 0-dark-thirty
&gt;  and call.

And be called a &quot;damn yank&quot; by the lady answering the phones.  Thats ok 
though, I got the &quot;wanker&quot; back :)

One thing I like the best about CE is their service, even over the pond here. 
 They stand behind what they sell and will make sure you are happy.  I had 
the welds at the hinge to the frame break. I called CE and they didn't ask 
many questions like the usual &quot;you didn't install them right&quot; or &quot;you must 
have done something to do that to them.&quot;  They just politely told my yankee 
arse that they would send out two new frames and that I need not send them 
the broken ones.  They were shipped that day.

Quality is great other than the inner channel being absent.  has anyone come 
up with a way to put one in?

im sorry, just bored and babbling
