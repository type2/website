&lt;&lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; What are the drawbacks to having 15 inch tires on the rear wheels of a
 big
 &gt;  stub (1965) pickup? I bought it that way and I don't know if I should
 change
 &gt;  them back to 14 inch or leave them alone. The fronts have 14 inch tires.
 &gt;   &gt;&gt;
 
 &gt; FWIW my 61 has the big stub/nut RGBs with 15&quot;s on the back.    Actually it
 &gt; has 14&quot;s on the front right now (till I get the 15&quot; rims powder coated and
 &gt; new tires), which makes the speedo read higher than it really goes, and
 the
 &gt; bus has that tilted nose dive look.
 
 Didn't 15&quot; wheels come standard on some years? If so, could you use a speedo
 from that year bus and have 15 inchers all around and still have the speedo
 show the right MPH's?
  &gt;&gt;
the speedo cable reads off the left front wheel, which on my 61 has a 185 /70 
R14 tire, smaller than the stock tire size which the speedo is set for- or 
was over 40 years ago.   The bus has the original speedo.   I guess if he has 
a speedo for the 14&quot; on the front and size tire that matches stock size it'll 
read right.  But  mine doesn't.   The rears are 205 75 15.   It wasn't 
planned- honest,  just ended up that way.   But it gets me daily from point A 
to point B over C which is mostly paved.  Eventually I want nice shiny 
powdercoated matches stock 15&quot; rims with hubcap clips and LT reinforced 
sidewall tires, but it's a driver, and there is no rush.
