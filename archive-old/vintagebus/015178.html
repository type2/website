Sorry to go public with this but does anyone know of a way of reaching Brendan
Murphy and/or Josh ?? elctronically? They drove a rusty blue and white
european standard named &quot;Bluey&quot; to numerous campouts all over the east coast
(i believe they might have even made it to the westy coast as well). If you
saw that driving road hazard you will probably remember them as winning
numerous &quot;dirtiest engine&quot; contests.

I believe that they are associates of &quot;everywhere&quot; ed o'donnel, nick bruchetta
(or however his name is spelt) and mark lapriore.

p-mail please if you have any leads.

thanks for your time.

michael
