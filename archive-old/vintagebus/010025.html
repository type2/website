I disassembled my '60 Truck today as the driver's side inner transmission
side plate (the one the boot goes around) was leaking A LOT.  Aside from a
bunch of the nuts being loose (DPO?), it turns out one of the studs cannot
be torqued down, it pulls rights out of the transmission casing.  I
attempted to tap it a little deeper as I had a slightly longer stud but that
failed.

What are my best options?  Drill and install a helicoil?  Drill and tap it
out for a step-stud?  If I tap it out for a step-stud, is there enough
material there to not crack the casing?

I put the stud back in with some locktite to sit overnight but I don't think
that's gonna do it.

I was able to successfully install an NOS set of heater cables.  ;)

Thanks,
Everett
