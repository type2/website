It's too long to post here, but this is the most succinct analysis of our =
situation that I have found. Noam Chomsky is a professor of linguistics at =
MIT, an author and widely known in International media. You won't see him =

lining in there.=20

I'll discuss by p-mail at my personal mail acct. hhouck_at_mediaone_dot_net=20
