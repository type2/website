    I just finished a hot run on my Eberspacher BA-4 heater out in my front
yard.  I'm pleased to report that it worked PERFECTLY!!  I'm planning to
install this into my '66 E-Z Camper.  This little unit can really put out
some serious heat!!  I'm thoroughly impressed with it.

    The retro-fit of a BA-4 is NOT your typical heater to get installed in a
splitty, so I've been taking pictures with my digital camera.  I'm slowly
writing a series of webpages documenting it for those who may be interested
in how the install goes once it's finished.

    I hope everyone had a good long weekend.
