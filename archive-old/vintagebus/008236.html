&gt;I use moth balls! The smell keeps them out rather than killing them and
then having to deal with THAT smell. A little practice with &gt;the amount and
you only have to do it twice a year. When it comes time to tackle the
project, you sweep them up, leave the &gt;doors open for a few hours and your
as fresh as spring.


Funny you should mention this Richard.  I did exactly that - using moth
balls, flakes, and whatever form it comes in.  I would return 2 days later
to find the bus smelling fairly strongly of moth repellant but ALL the
mothballs/flakes were gone.  A week later, you couldn't even tell I
mothballed it at all.  Come to find out, where the bus was sitting was in
direct sunlight.  As it would heat up inside, I guess it accelerated the
evaporation rate.  This happened on at least 2 occasions that I know of.
That's why I suggested poison or some kind of permanent repellant because
the mothballs just didn't seem to last nor be worth the money spent.  Just
my 2 cents...
