&lt;&lt; Anyone know of a good place for a bus tarp? RMMW has them but they seem
 steep, so, either I'm cheap or not looking in the right places. I'd
 appreciate any help.

Hi Brad,
If you have a VW that needs protection from the wet weather and the paint is
nothing to write home about.  You can you those polypropalene tarps from
hardware stores and Costco.  Preferably about 20' x 15&quot; and it is important
that you buy two for each of the Vw you plan to cover.  Bungie and/or tie two
tarps so they make two layers of protection.  Due to the material of the tarps
the ultraviolet of the sun will attack the top tarp and if it was the only
tarp on you VW the water would start streaming through and into your VW in
about 2-3 months.  With two tarps the under tarp is protected from the sun and
countinues to repel the water.  When about 6 months has past you will notice
the upper tarp start to fall apart.  This is the time to remove the old tarps.
Throw away the upper one and then install a new tarp under the old tarp that
is still in good shape.  This is not a perfect storage system.  Wind moves the
tarps and will rub at the paint removing it.  Also the tarp will tend to hold
some condensated moisture under it so it would behoove you to partially remove
the tarp on warm sunny days and open windows of the VW to air it out on
occasion.  This will help to keep out water from getting into your VW in large
amounts.     Eric &amp; Barb
