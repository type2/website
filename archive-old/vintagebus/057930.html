Subject: Blown Engine Pics

Here are the gory pics I promised yesterday. None of the valves broke, 
btw, it looks like a wrist pin failure. Did not run it low on oil or 
overheat it. Thought about taking the rod and piston/cylinder sandwich 
to the FLAPS to see if they might have a clue, but it doesn't make much 
difference at this point.

That damage only took a few seconds from the time I heard it til I shut 
it down.
