&lt;&lt; widow's peak bus ...(an entry in the &quot;barndoor&quot; replacement contest).  &gt;&gt;

 I like it, sounds evil and witchy and mysterious, from the depths of the 
black forest............. the widow's peak bus.    Plus I really like that 
line of the BD, I mean WP bus, it's really classy and art deco, it's all 
about art deco. Stands out from the later splittys.   Descriptive.   Although 
some seem to brush a quif over the WP (BD ambulance fan) it is still there.
