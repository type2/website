Subject: Trailer hitches for splitties...

Speaking of which...does anyone have a hitch for a bus?  I'd sure like to
tow my trailer around with my bus (eventually.)  I'm actually entertaining
the idea just for fun of towing Li'l Red with the towbar and then have the
trailer hooked to Li'l Red (74 Super Beetle).  I'd like to do this around
the block or around town just for fun.  It'd sure make the locals look...
