 &lt;&lt; I purchased 2 new windshields and rubber for my 65 and it still leaks.  
Is 
 there a secret?  Should I use some sort of glue?  &gt;&gt;
 Hi Jon,
 Us roofing tar.  Get a condiment container with the pull off tip (Not the 
 screw open/closed kind!) from your local supermarket and lift the edge of 
 your rubber with a screwdriver carefully and squirt some tar in there.  Make 
 sure to go all the way around the rubber/body frame to seal it well.  Then 
 use kerosene to clean up any excess.  Unfortunitly you should have tarred 
 between the glass and rubber before installiation to prevent that white haze 
 at the bottm of the glass from the water attacking the lastic laminate 
 between the glass layers.  Eric&amp;Barb

I agree, roofing tar is a great sealant for windsheilds.  Also it makes a big 
difference if you have a nice smooth sealing surface for the seal- on the 
window area in the bus.  Unfortunately this involves work- ie 
snading/wirewheeling everything clean to bare metal, welding if neccessary, 
rust converter, primer, body putty to fill in the rust pits, sand smooth, 
primer, paint.  And of couse using roofing tar for installation.  RT will 
stain new white paint, but it cleans up very easily with rags and WD-40.
