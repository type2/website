Subject: [VB] $99,000 Westy 

 But really - how many people would want a 100K Westy.  Its not like you 
could actually drive it - at least, I couldn't.  I'd be terrified of wearing 
the rubber on the gas peddle. You would have a bus that you would have to 
garage (is that a verb) and trailer to shows - not for me.  I'd rather take 
the 100K (if I had it) and have a nice camper, nice double cab, beater 
single cab, ghia, ol' beetle, maybe a beater Thing, and still have change 
left for insurance and take the Warden out for a nice dinner.
