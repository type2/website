I give three cheers to Eric for having an open mind to all things that
interest him and the fact that he isn't swayed by public opinion and makes
his own choices.  Diversity is very cool....expands horizions...opens up a
wealth of opportunities more narrow minded folks won't see.
Not putting down Wades opinion for sure....just adding my own!

&gt; just curious Eric.....how can you stand to go from:
&gt; &quot;an *original* unrestored westy in very good condition&quot;
&gt; &quot;71 pan (for the irs), ghia disk brakes, set of Porsche alloys, full velour
&gt; interior, filled dash with custom vdo gauge set&quot; ?
&gt; Besides the fact that its free or cheap, It seems like a very big change
&gt; that I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy, even if he wasn't a vintage
&gt; nazi :)
