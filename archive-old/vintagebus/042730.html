&gt; Maybe a stupid question, but I put a nice primer on my '65 and got some

&gt; surface would make for better adhesion with the topcoat.
Most definitely...

If you sand it after the topcoat the primer will come through wherever
there is a bump and you will have to topcoat it again. Basically, you want
the primer to be as flat and as perfect as you want the final paint job to
be.  Any impoerfections in your prep will show up in the topcoat.

Unless you just want it all one color and protected from the elements.  If
so, spray away ;)

take care,

Steve
