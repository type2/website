Subject: Seal for rear hatch prop rod?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone have a good used seal for a rear hatch prop rod on 55-63 busses?
My 57 standard has an original one, the 56 westy has a space where one was at 
one time.
This is a little rubber gasket what keeps the rear rod form rattling.
Any help, leads...or a good used one would be great.
ANyone repoping this?
Thanks!
Greg
