Subject: Re: [T2] electronic voltage regulator to replace mechanical
  one??

no i dont have the Bosch Part #
its probably the same number as the mechanical unit maybe with a
different alphabetical suffix.
ive had mine for a long time. looks almost like the mechanical units and
directly replaces them.
do you have a vwflaps near you?
I would just go to the counter and ask.
lets ask the list and see....


Q for the masses.
What are the part numbers for the Solid State Bosch regulators for 30A and
38A gens??
