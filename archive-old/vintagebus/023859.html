Subject: stalling problem

Lately I've found that my 67 westy (with 71 DP engine) has a tendency to stall
at lights when driving in city traffic after its been warmed up. I tried
removing the inline filter and setting the fuel line away from the intake
tubes or other hot areas but it still seems to stall out when warm. Any ideas?
Also developed a backfiring prob but has electronic ignition and I tightened
all exhaust connections. Can the little preheat tubes cause backfiring if leaking?
