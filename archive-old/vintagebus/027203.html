Subject: Re: [VB] Rebuilt Engines?

&lt;&lt;This myth that only Germans could produce quality stuff is a
bit silly.&gt;&gt;

Not only is it a bit silly, I just don't think it is true. My 1972
beetle that I bought new was a very fine car. Nearly flawless. My only
complaint was with the coil and the plugs, both made by Bosch and which
were IMHO junk!!! Was Bosch also hiring Iranian workers??

I put 140,000 very trouble free miles on that bug, despite the fact that
I was 19 when I bought it and ran the dogpiss out of it.
