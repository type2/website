Subject: Like to trade rims and tires.

The problem I'm having with my bus is that with my freeway flyer trans and
tall 15&quot; rims with tires, I not only have a speedo that off, but a bus that
is geared too steep.  Rob Laffoon out of Omaha runs a freeway flyer with 14&quot;
rims and tires as well as a stock 1600cc engine.

I can tell that my bus is just geared way too steep and I actually want to
slow it down so I have a little more grunt power.  I've posted this before
but what I would like to do is trade my 5 powder-coated rims with tires
(that have about 4500 miles on them now) for a set of white powder coated
(With good clips) 14&quot; rims with tires that are in okay shape. The beauty of
having a 14&quot; rim is that you can buy used P205 tires for a song and drive
around on a budget.

Now my rims were stock on a bus up through 1963 so if anyone has a later
50's thru 1963 bus and wants a P185 radial (no bias ply here!) so that you
have a somewhat stock look (skinny tires) with the benefits of a radial
tire, now is your chance.  The tires are 2 ply but they are rated as a light
duty sport utility tire.

I spent $125 getting the rims blasted and powdercoated and another $475+ in
tires with mount and balance back in September of 1999.

For someone looking for a good set of 5 luggers for their bus, this is it.
Please pass this info around and see if you can help me out.
