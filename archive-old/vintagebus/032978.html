Hi all...
    I am new to the list.
Yesterday I got my 58th VW.  A 1962 Deluxe 15 window.
Engine is not stock.  Wheels are not stock.
I would like a stock interior.
Problem is I only have the front seat.  Everything else is missing.
No radio, ashtray, clock, O. Schitt Handle, middle seat, rear seat,
jail bars, rear window, Headliner, panels, NOTHING inside, but the driver's
bench...  I need it all...  Anybody got any of this? Or can I see yours
so I can make copies or get ideas?

well, you want it stock?   what colour is your bus?   Maybe someday i'll get
my photo collection of original buses scanned and on a website, but it isn't
yet.   Go to swap meets.  there should be lots in so cal.   you can get a
repro headliner.
......
I have been reading this reduction box thread.
I want mine gone.  I have a new stock tranny. 4.13. I have a 1600 dual port.
Yesterday on flat ground with pedal to the floor in 4th I got almost 40mph.
I need 65 at 3000rpm.  My bug does that, My Notch did that.
Ruduction boxes won't let this happen whatever math I use.

well, soomething is wrong cause you should get more than 40mph with a 4.125
R&amp;P (I guess you have the big nut boxes).   When I had that set up in my 65
westy I would drive around 55, but it could go faster.     I'd say it was
with your motor.

I guess you want to lower your bus.  I wouldn't find that practical, but then
my bus is a work vehicle and I also drive rutted unpaved roads and don't like
grinding down a muffler every year.   With a 3.88 R&amp;P  I now get 58mph at 3K.
  with higher gearing in a bu it would be harder on hills (1600 stock sp).
get yr motor power problem sorted and see how you feel.
