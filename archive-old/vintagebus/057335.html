&gt;  Can anyone tell me how to tell a *correct* pulley
&gt; for an h-case motor?...
&gt;  June 22, 1967 vintage to be exact  Also, would
&gt; anyone have a picture they
&gt;  could email me of a *correct* motor?
&gt;  
&gt;  TIA
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; I'd look at brochures.  make sure the pic has the
&gt; pre heat hose running 
&gt; forward to the heater box- if it runs down to a pick
&gt; up pipe through the rear 
&gt; tin it is early 66 or earlier.   
&gt; 
&gt; whos going to assemble an on line gallery of vintage
&gt; original engine pics?  
&gt; dated?  please?
