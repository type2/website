The idea behind baking soda is that it's water soluble, isn't rust promoting and cheap. It's also very gentle, I saw factory grind swirls after my DC was done. D-earth is cheap, holds moisture better than sand though. Easier to get, for sure. 

Anybody see the Hot-VW-Trends (can't remember, or distinguish between the rags) article on pushing abrasive foam through heads to port &amp; polish them? How about pushing some of that stuff through rockers, or through the whole damn rusty bus?
