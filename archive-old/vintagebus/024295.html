I checked around and the Y356 is a discontinued tire.  The Canadian
distributer
has one(1) left.

Yokohama has two possible replacements:

Y370 LT195/75R14D  (very tame streat tread)
SD05 LT195/75R14C  (meatier tread, they call it all season, LT and RV)

I'm currently planning to go with Bridgestone Dueler A/T D693 195/75/R14C
Nice meaty tread, decent load rating, easy availability.

Any input on my choice is appreciated.  I still have to get my rims blasted
and painted.

Thanks,
...Markus

&gt; It's true that the Library section is deficient in tire articles but the
&gt; thought that you can't find anything in the Archive section leaves me
&gt; gaping.
&gt;
&gt; 185/75 or 195/75. The tire with neither peer nor complaint known to exist
&gt; is the Yokohama Y356, which is appropriate and commonly available in load
&gt; range C but you might want D if you carry loads of rocks or something. This
&gt; is what I am getting when I get some money.
&gt;
&gt; I can write a filter that intercepts messages about tires size, you know. I
&gt; can. I love to write filters. =^ )
