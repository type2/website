&gt;That is what's know as a &quot;Hurst&quot; bumper.  Supposed to be a
&gt;highly desireable bus accessory.  I think they're one of the ugliest
&gt;things you can bolt to a car.  I've heard legends of people selling
&gt;them for $1000 for a set.
&gt;
Think I'l make a set up and put them on the Westfailure. Probably get a
picture on your hall of shame page then.
