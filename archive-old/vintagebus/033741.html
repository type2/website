     The great race has come and gone, a lot of excitment for our town, not
as much as Buses by the Bridge though :~). One of the highlights was seeing
and talking to Bill Collins in his 49 HEB, the only VW in the race and we'll
let him slide being he was running a Porsche 356 engine of course it was of
49 vintage!
