I figured I would post to let people see what I and many others are looking
for.  There is a great picture of this no legged jump seat on Everett
Barnes' awesome VW site (http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/), it can be located by
going to What'sNew and clicking on the 66 Campmobile brochure.  Very sad to
see what my bus was like at one time, Great page Everett, Thanks!
Additionally, any one out there have one and what the dimensions are,
shouldn't be terribly hard to fabricate this seat with all that gold
pleather around!.
