&lt;&lt; Guys, this is the sort of thing that can be handled offline.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Thom Fitzpatrick &gt;&gt;

Au Contraire, Thom.

This is exactly the type of thing which should be aired on the list.  If I 
bid on an item on ebay from this vendor, (which I have done), I would be very 
appreciative of anyone who's had a bad experience with him to let me know 
what that consisted of.

I have seen plenty of bad mouthing of other vendors, and I wonder why this 
fellow should be exempted from scrutiny.  I refer, of course, to the scathing 
posts about my friend Dawn of PLF (about whom I have nothing but very 
positive feelings) which have been allowed to run their course on the list.  
Dawn has had a rough time with her business and other aspects of her life, 
but I hear no reasons for &quot;mr.kdf&quot; to misrepresent the condition of his 
offerings.

This is a public forum, and I have no objection to hearing about the problems 
that some of us have had with the people we deal with in the pursuit of our 
hobby.  And it is a hobby.  This is supposed to be fun, for those of use who 
pursue our interest in busses as a respite to our day to day lives.

So please, Thom, let those of us who derive pleasure from the chase for 
obscure parts, have all the information we can garner in our quest.  And, to 
anyone who's interested, I have a 36 horse, line bored case, available for a 
reasonable amount (money back, if you're not satisfied - keep the case)!

Thanks for letting me vent.  Come see me at the Classic.  A 1959 Gray over 
Sealing Wax Red subhatch Westfalia with New Mexico plates - open to all 
listees!!!  And of course OCTO!

Looking forward to meeting all of you,

JP
