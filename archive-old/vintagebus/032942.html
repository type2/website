&lt;&lt; Using the Bug or Type 3 trans will give you gearing better designed for 
street and highway driving, but will limit your ability to haul loads of 
cement up steep hills for long distances. Most people interested in lowering 
their Bus are not using them as workhorses anyway. &gt;&gt;
Hi BBs,
The problem is that it is too easy to just load a bus due to all that lovely 
room in the cargo area.  In example lets say someone has a non-walk through 
delux bus with full length middle seat.  Result is that one can easily load 9 
people inside for a ride, and this does not include possible luggage or tools 
on board.  Now let us say that the average wieght of each person on board is 
150 Lbs., which results in a cargo wieght of (9 x 150 Lbs.) 1350 Lbs.!  
Interesting that this figure is over double of the official 600 Lbs. cargo 
wieght limit of the bug!  

&lt;&lt;
1) Early Type 3 complete (the best)
2) Early Bug Complete with a spacer for the drums (the worst)
3) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with machined 63 and older Bus drums
(good)
4) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with Thing rear drums (good)&gt;&gt;

Okay if one has to lower thier bus we would highly recommend against the 
above first option.  The problem with type 3 drums is that they are too weak 
for the wieght of the bus, and doublely so if one lowers the rear axle till 
the brake drums normally ride in a bottom tilted outward more than the tops 
attitude.  We found this out from a type 3 freak years ago.  The rear drums 
of the heavily lowered type 3s crack around the hub area of the brake drums, 
and mind you that these guys never carried any kind of a load!  Just take a 
good look at a type 3 &amp; 2 drum, and see the differance in strength in design, 
and extra thickness of metal.
