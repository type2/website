Jim....I know the feeling!
I had a Model A street rod.  Spent 5 years bulding it.  The car went on to
win some very prestigious awards and trophies..one in Pleasanton, CA was
the biggest.
didn't matter..some yahoo would come along and spot the damndest thing and
make some put down comment about it like &quot;  Oh yea it's nice but would ya
look at that!&quot;...and then you find out they drive a Kia they customized
all by themselves too!
Don't let it get to you.  It ain't worth it.  Opinions are like you know
what since everyone has one right!
