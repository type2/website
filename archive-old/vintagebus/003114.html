The bay swap will raise the front, whether you do it the bolt in way or the
hard way. Bay beams have higher ride heights. The rear in the Westfailure
has a Ford 9 inch on leaf springs, and the front required coilovers to raise
it to stock height. This will not be the case in a non V8 mid-engine
conversion. The bay beam is pushed all the way up when it bolts in, there is
no 2 inches to move it. You must cut and turn the beam if you want it lower.
There are no shortcuts when hacking up a splittie. 8^)

&gt; and so would the front be higher than you would like it ?
&gt; and did you also have to lift the saggy rear ( V8) ?
&gt; is the whole ride now too high ?
&gt; perhaps the rear was re-splined to accomodate the V8
&gt; but the front still rides higher...
&gt; it would seem better to stuff in the whole front beam,
&gt; ignoring the obvious 2-bolt hole savings, in favor of a
&gt; more correct ride height. by pushing the beam up those
&gt; two inches and making 4  new mounting holes
