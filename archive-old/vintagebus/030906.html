How about getting an alignment?  Center the steering wheel and adjust
your toe from there. You can get this pretty close just in your
driveway.  Best to take it in and a shop can hook it up to the computer.
Are you getting any strange tire wear?  Maybe your tie rods are bent.
Does the bus pull to the left or right if you are driving and let go of
the wheel?

 &gt; I have the same problem, and my wheels rub if I turn my wheel to far. I
 &gt; think we have to disconnect the shaft to the arm below, check the wheel

so far
 &gt; in ONE direction with this wrong, center the unit, and reconnect the 
shaft.
 &gt; I don't beleive removing the wheel will help at all.

 &gt; OK, sad post of the week.
 &gt;
 &gt; When driving in a straight line, my steering wheel spokes are at 1 &amp; 7
 &gt; o'clock.
 &gt;
 &gt; This really bugs me, but 'cos it is a keyed shaft, I can't see how to
 &gt; get them to 3&amp;9.
 &gt;
 &gt; Any ideas?
 &gt;
 &gt; TIA
 &gt; Simon.
