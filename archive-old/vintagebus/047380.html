Got out of the ABC meeting a little bit ago and it looks like there should be 
a relatively steady stream of VW's heading from Phoenix to LHC on Friday.  
Anywhere from early AM  until well after dark.  It seems the general 
consensus it to take I-10 to Quartzite and hang a north.  It really is kind 
of a nice drive, especially along the Colorado River.  

Debbie and I, in the DC, and Michelle in her bug, should be on the road from 
Avondale by around 3-4 PM, (in case we meet anyone on the road).  Probably 
won't make it there before DARK but hopefully John and Ronnie and the crew 
will save us a few taco's?????
