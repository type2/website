Subject: Insulation

The '64 Singlecab I just picked up had the same problem. Matted up pink 
insulation collecting moisture and rusting everything from the inside up. Try 
the self adhesive rubberized sheets sold at J.C. Whitney. The are the same 
that are sold custom/rod shops for much more money!

&gt; Here's my .02
&gt; 
&gt; I had a panel bus that that PO used fiberglass insulation in to quite it 
&gt; down.  Unfortunately when I went to restore the vehicle and removed the 
&gt; panels, I found the bus was rusting from the inside out.  The fiberglass 
&gt; insulation only needed to get a little bit of water on it and the watter 
&gt; would wick its way up the inside of the panel.  The water would then sit on 
&gt; 
&gt; the inside of the panel with the fiberglass and cause all kinds of rust.   
&gt; IT WAS A HUGE MESS.  Since that little experience, I would not put 
&gt; fiberglass in unless you could make sure it didn't get wet.
