&gt; He charged me about 325 each.
&gt; 

$650 to get bumpers straightened and chromed?  Holy
mackarel that's a lot!  Or is it?  I've been banging
on mine for quite some time to straighten them out,
but I would not expect them to be perfect.  On the
other hand, if I spent $650 for a pair of bumpers,
they'd better be perfect in every way.  I figure I've
spent about $25 on mine so far, not including my labor
- which is free to me.
