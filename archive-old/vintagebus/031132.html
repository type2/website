Report:

Friday:  I met up with fellow Phoenix VW people Richard &quot;RustyBus&quot; K. ('61
Ragtop Standard), Earl ('57 Single Cab), Gary ('58 Single Cab), and Scott
('66 Double Cab).  After bs'ing around, we ended up leaving at 6:30 am,
heading for Cabazon, CA (5-6 hour drive) to meet up with the caravan from
Lake Havasu (Ronnie, VW Howard, et al.).  After a couple extra stops for
Earl to top off his oil because of a nasty rear main seal leak and Gary
to check his gas tank (leaking at the mid-seam and neck weld), we arrived
at Cabazon at 12:30, just missing the Lake Havasu crew.  A quick bite to
eat and we were off to Christmas Tree Island where we checked out Rich Yost's
completed shop, very impressive, then it was off to Lenny's shop for the
party.  We ended up getting there a little late to eat but still enjoyed
the open shop and fine array of restored and under-restoration vehicles.

Saturday it was off to the OCTO show in the early am.  There was an insane
amount of Buses there.  A lot of crazy prices like usual but quite a few
deals as well.  I always find it funny how a seller will have some items
that are perfectly reasonable and some items that are 2-3x what they should
be.  One seller had a Single Cab and Double Cab hoops and canvas setup for
$800 and $400, respectively.  The Double Cab setup was definately a deal.
 I picked up a couple things in the swaps like 1 original paint green/green
crows foot rim for my '58 Standard (need 1 more).  I met David Mayes at
OCTO and after the OCTO show, I gave him a ride over to the Toy &amp; Lit. show,
where the usual literature crack-head prices abounded.  Surprisingly, I
actually purchased more items at the Toy show than OCTO, although only 1
piece was literature.  Sat. night it was off to Irvine Lake for the campout.
 Great time, the VTO guys put on a very entertaining raffle and the view
from the campground over the Lake is nice.

Sunday, I rose early as I was picking up a roof rack that was due to just
be sitting in someone's swap spot.  I was about 30th in line for the Classic.
 Luckily this year they were a little smarter and didn't wait until 8 am
to open the gates.  Unfortunately, they continued to have stupidity reign
supreme when it comes to speed and organization and it still took 30 minutes
to get into the show.  Fewer Buses than the day before but a decent turnout
of restored Oval and Split-window Bugs, which also interest me.  Swap meet
was it's typical high VW-Classic prices but there were deals to be found
early in the am and late in the day.  I actually saw quite a few items that
did not sell and were reasonably priced including 5-6 sets of semaphores,
a ton of early 25hp parts, NOS split-case tranny housings, etc..  I have
heard there were not many vehicle sales either but am not sure about that.
 Ronnie pointed out a cut-in-half 16&quot; Bus rim in the swaps to me, it was
date 1/55, same as my Kombi rims, so I impulse bought it at $10.  I had
some fun showing it to people and asking them if they heard what happened
to my Bus on the way there.  &quot;No way!  Are you serious?!?&quot;  ;)

Monday, we rose late and headed back to Phoenix at about 1:30 pm.  The ride
went smooth except when Earl pulled into a gas station athte CA/AZ border,
his '57 Single Cab had the sound of a huge exhaust leak.  He opened the
decklid and out fell a spark plug.  He'd driven on 3 cylinders for at least
80 miles, doh!  A quick fix on we were on our way home with no further problems,
arriving about midnight.
