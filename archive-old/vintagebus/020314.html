Well, I am stumped with this strange carburator issue. It is a new one on 
me. 1963 bus, 1600 dual port, 009, 34-pict carb. Timing is set correctly, 
valves adjusted. 
The strangeness is this- it won't start unless you pump the gas a couple 
times, then hold it completely on the floor until started. If you just 
pump the gas while turning it over, then it won't start. This even 
happens after it's been well warmed up. I have tried adjusting the idle 
and mixture screws, but to no avail...
Also, the bus gets like 12 miles per gallon, which is horrible...
It runs fine (other than the gas mileage) once you start it, doesn't 
stall out or anything.
any leads would be greatly appreciated. It's a pretty new carburator, and 
engine in general...
