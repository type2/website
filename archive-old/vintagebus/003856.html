With all this talk of people who aren't able to attend a VW event for one
reason or the other - I just wanted to extend the offer to anyone who wants
to attend BNNTA.  Pack lightly and you can ride with me from Beatrice, NE to
Hannibal, MO.  If you are along the way I can pick you up otherwise, get as
far as Beatrice, NE and you can ride along with me.  These bus events are
really cool...
