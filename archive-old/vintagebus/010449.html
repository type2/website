Well with Travelocity_dot_com, I was able to make it from Omaha to Phoenix with
3 to 4 layovers.  Doesn't really bother me much to layover - I keep myself
occupied by reading dub mags and playing the Gameboy.  But even then, these
tickets are around $250.

For this price I would be able to see the likes of Memphis, Denver,
Minneapolis, Fort Worth, St. Louis, and Salt Lake City.  Man, what a ride
that would be.

:-)
