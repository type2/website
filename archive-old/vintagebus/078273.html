Subject: Re: headlight bulbs

Hi Michael,

It's been a really long time, but lemmee see... the replacement bulbs are
small bayonet style, bulb with metal shoulder and body, which implies that
they fit a bayonet hole. The original lamps are sealed full lamps, and fit
into the standard VW bucket. Hmmm.... let me check outside....

The H4's fit into a hemispherical half-dome that has fits into the back of
the bucket, replacing the standard lamp, and has a bayonet bulb opening in
the center, for the H4.

It was offered to me that it may have been a standard part for Vanagons,
or some other later VW van. I don't recall where I got them, but it could
have been at a large VW show, like the Classic, or Kelly Park. Back in
the mid-90s.

That's all I can say at this point. Try checking with WW, or Ronnie in AZ
on the list, or Bus Depot, also on the list.

Good hunting!

&gt; Hi Cal,
&gt; Hope you don't mind me writing you &quot;off-line&quot;. Wanted to ask you about those halogen bulbs
&gt; that you referred to in your post to Matt Roberds. Been following the recent thread on headlight bulbs
&gt; and I'm thinking about converting to those H6024 bulbs you and others have written about
&gt; sounds like the way to go for increased light. Gonna check my &quot;flaps&quot; in town here. What about these adapters you
&gt; speak of? Where did you find these?  A friend told me that J.C.Whitney at one point sold these.
&gt; Wondered if you could point me in the right direction.
&gt; Thanks,
