I tried to get ahold of them right before Xmas with both pmail and fax with
no response.  Then during the first week of January (I think... maybe it was
the week after Xmas..  it's all blurry) someone finally returned my call.
Seems they're going through some restructuring but promised that all will be
better.

Their phone number is
408 295-7914
408 291 0209 FAX

good luck

Dave
