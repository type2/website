Subject: T4 cylinders needed
Date: Thu, 4 Jan 2001 19:43:11 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Back in August of 2000 at the RMMW show, I bought a set of brand new P/C for
a T4 2L engine.  This was a brand new Cofap set and I got it for $20.  The
only catch was 2 of the cylinders had badly chipped fins.

I would like to know if anyone has a set of new or good used (meaning little
wear - spec'd out and so forth) that they would like to sell.  I'm getting
tired of sitting on this damn computer everyday waiting for winter to go
away so I think I can appease the VW demon by amassing some parts that I can
eventually use on a T4 to T1 conversion.

Lemme know...
