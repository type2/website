Subject: Heater follow up

Howdy,

Just wanted to let ya'll know I got my heater in my '66 working so great, we
were able to take the Bus out looking at Christmas lights last night.
Quick review, the exhaust in the cabin smell was from 2 badly worn donut
exhaust gaskets. Replaced those. Secondly, the oily smell was from leaky
valve covers that had soaked the heat exchangers, inside and out.  Cleaned
them real well with degreaser. And finally, the missing heater tubes from
the heat exchangers to the heater 'mufflers', I used 2&quot; PVC pipe cut to 4&quot;
length, which slides nicely into the heater 'mufflers' and then used the
std, fresh air hose which slides nicely over the heat exchanger and then
over the PVC pipe.  Learned something, with out the heater 'mufflers', the
engine noise comes right up to the front of the cabin, strange.

Thanks to all who responded with help.
