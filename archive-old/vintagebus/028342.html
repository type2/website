Subject: template wanted

Or things my mother never told me. At the Sacramento Bug-o-Rama I saw
two westies and talked to their owners about a feature I came to learn
my '61 should have. The back of the front seat lifts up and tucks into
this hammock-like thingy which is suspended from a rod fitted into two
brackets above the doors. I have the brackets but never knew what they
were for. Now I am looking for a pattern/template for the (canvas?)
hammock/sling affair that holds the seat back. Anybody out there have a
pattern/template or know of somebody who makes this product?
Bob, in northern Calif.
