Subject: Re: [VB] re:engine tin

&gt; does this engine tin you are talking about curve around each cylinder head?
&gt; I have seen some aftermarket stuff in magazines or on the internet, where
&gt; there is a piece of tin that wraps around each head. I will see if I can
&gt; find the link, or magazine ad.
&gt;
&gt; actually i just found it-it is called super tin, and CB performance carries
&gt; it. www.cbperformace_dot_com


Super Tin?
Its just a cheap repro of type 3 tins.
They replace the little deflector.
If you check the archives there has been plenty of discussion in the
past.
