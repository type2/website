My first experience with Safari type windshields was with a Model A
Ford!!!  Not safaris obviously, but they came stock on ALL models...not
much choice of having anything but a pop out windshield on them!
It's 60 years old and the seals that are repro'd are excellent...but guess
what...they leak too!  Gotta love em just the same!
later

&gt; say the originals leak less, but less doesnt cut it in MHO... it either
&gt; leaks or doesnt.)
