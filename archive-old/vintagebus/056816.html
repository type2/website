Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Up until I landed my new job a couple of years ago, I not only drove my '61 
DC to work, but it was used around the construction sites (I was on the 
electrician crew at various new Walgreens) as a work truck, hauling the 
several hundred light fixtures and supplies from the storage container to the 
building.  We even used its bed with the gates down to haul the 20 to 25 foot 
long parking lot light poles/fixtures around to their respective locations on 
the site.  The other electricians had F_at_rds and Ch_at_vy's, but the DC worked 
out the best and was prefered by all.

Now days, I figure if the new company wants to buy me a F_at_rd and pay for the 
gas, insurance, registration, repairs, etc. what the heck, I might as well 
drive it.  The DC is having transmission issues, anyway.  I haven't exactly 
put it out to pasture.  It's just grazing in the back yard until I swap the 
new (later modle) tranny and front end into it and get it ready to haul 
around the 1960 Lil' Loafer camp trailer that the wife and I camp in now.

Anyway, that's my excuse.  Boo Hoo!!! :)
