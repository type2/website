Subject: Re: [VB] Jack point repair

Look under the truck and see how the sheet metal looks that attaches to and surrounds the jack
point. Is it badly rusted? If so, you need to repair all this metal before you will be able to
safely use the jack point again. Rust in this area is a common problem.

&gt; The PO of my 67 kombi did a terrible job fixing what I assume was caused by
&gt; an incorrect jack usage in the rear right jack point.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; I need advices on how to repair this.
&gt; Should I rotate the jack point clockwise using force? Should I replace that
&gt; section? How about the metal sheet?
&gt; Any input would be appreciated.
