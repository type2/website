hey all...
.._dot_decided to create more space in the garage today by consolidating some
parts... new parts that have been sitting around waiting for me to do
something with them.
    So I built up a shortblock... .020&quot; cut on the case, .010&quot;/.010&quot; for the
crank, reman balanced rods (+/- 0.1g, on the triple beam), new lifters, new
flat cam, the best gears I had out of the bunch for the south end of the
crank, da da da... also new case-savers &amp; new 8mm studs.
    The new thing I tried out was the silk thread trick... helps to assure
against leaks in old tired cases like mine. I was on a trip to Chattanooga
many months ago when I happened to see an Orvis (i.e &quot;fly-fisherperson
place&quot;) store... upscale yuppity place. 'spensive.
    They at least had some silk thread (per RSH, only pure silk thread
should be used for this). The # on the top of the spool read &quot;4&quot;... which
made sense since there were 4 strands of silk making up one thread. I cut
off about a 2 to 3 foot length and separated it into the smaller strands.
    I brushed a light coat of permatex on the left case half, and then went
all the way 'round it using several strands of silk, since there are a few
gaps designed in there, and I could do that. The permatex was tacky enough
to hold the strands in one place with light finger pressure. After a little
while I brushed another light coat of permatex over the case half, and
installed the right case half over the left &amp; began putting the hardware
on...
    The case looks a little odd now, flat black with wispy lines of silk
drifting from every opening on the parting line... some kind of halloween
thing.
    I'll sock it away for the '65 whenever I get the tranny situation
rectified. ...leak-free buses :)
