&gt; Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:
&gt; 
&gt; theme. You can find info at www.Burningman_dot_com. This is a big event
&gt; featuring an experiment in temporary community for one week, located north
&gt; of Reno, NV. The organizers encourage a &quot;theme&quot; camp. I am going this year
&gt; (August 27-September 3rd) to check it out, thinking about next year. I see
&gt; having a big bus camp theme, with some sort of Bus/VW art expo, giving the
&gt; public a look see at what most of us experience at most every bus event. We
&gt; could &quot;wagon train&quot; our camp and place VW bus items around and other related
&gt; items and really make it an event (I'm I going mad?). This can be a chance
&gt; to let others &quot;outside&quot; our hobby get some interaction/exposure with a VW
&gt; art twist. Any who are interested, let me know!!

I've considered it, but $175-200 per person (and they consider children
and pets as &quot;persons&quot; too) to camp on a dry lake that is free the rest of
the year seems just a bit steep!  They even want $20 a head if you want to
leave the event and return!  A search of the Burning Man web site for
the word &quot;charity&quot; yielded only one hit, but that was about the ice
concession, not the organizers. Somebody's making _lot_ of money on this
event and if any money goes to charity they're keeping it very close to
the vest.

The second negative, having grown up in Nevada, is that the Black Rock
Desert has to be the last place to go if you want to camp.  Windstorms,
duststorms, sandstorms, etc. are common.  The portion of the Burning Man
web site that tries to talk you out of bringing your dog to the event is
probably the most honest about the weather and camping conditions.

Third, the Justice of the Peace in Gerlach has stated that &quot;Burning Man is
the penance I have to pay for all the hell I raised as a teenager.&quot;  If
the local legal authorities in a state that is known for its tolerant and
easygoing attitude are that down on the event, it wouldn't do the bus
community much good to be associated with it.  All we need is for some
idiot to commit something nasty enough to hit the national news with a
backdrop of buses for the cameras.

I'll save my money for real bus events.

George Lyle
