While on the camper interior topic, does anyone have the hot tip for removing
the original laminate (formica) that came on the mid 60's Westy interior.  I'll
eventually have to reface my interior parts, and I'd like the new laminate to
not be too thick.  Heat, steam, elbow grease??  I know there are a few pro
refinishers on the list, how do the pros do it?  Thanks in advance.\

S.
