Subject: clunk in the front

hey... i have noticed lately a barely audible clunk in the front end of my 
bus. i can really only hear it when i am slowing to a stop at less than 10 
mph. it not the brakes because i have recently adjusted them. could this be 
what a wheel bearing sounds like when it goes? what happens when they go? do 
they implode on themselves?

thanks!
