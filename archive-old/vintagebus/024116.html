Subject: New addition, '67 Delux

Greetings Volks!

Announcing the addition of an honored Vintage era VW Deluxe Walk through
van the the &quot;Gibson Stables&quot;.  I ,now the proud owner this '67 Splitty
VIN #257050976 , am mindful of the opportunity/responsibilitiy of saving
it from disappearing into history and  do here by pledge to do what ever
possible and necessary to make this happen.  I therefore appeal to the
Vintage community for assistance  towards the salvation of this bus.  My
budget's
tight, but this is a &quot;must save&quot;!

                    [   UJ 2512 434470 7050976    ]

   I need to make it a reliable, functional daily driver for the wife
and kids and will very much need the assistance and/or guidance {or bits
and pieces of busses that have passed the point of no return) as well as
of blood, sweat and tears.  Bone yards beware!

A little description of what shape she's in.....  Inspection sticker
shows she was last registered in 1986.  Gas at pump feels &amp; smells like
lacquer. upper body paint is cracked and flaking up, surface rust spots
along windows, gutters and left rear body panel near back wheel.  At
present PO took out all windows (top priority).  Engine 1500sp, case #
B6413011,  missing carb, and dist (guy he bought if from said it ran)
};&gt;] ... We shall see.  Interior is non existent, remnants of Deluxe
interior panels, no seats and no flooring (solid metal though).  Cab
shows patches needed on both corners and step on passenger door shows
terminal cancer growth that will need to be cut out and reconstructed.
Hope this shows the extent on help needed.

 I am good at restoring things to like new condition so condition is not
an issue and would even barter that service in exchange for anything I
could get, instruction, parts etc.

Well, I'm gonna hit the archives on the arts &amp; science of VW vintage
buss resurrection.  any pointers to guide me through the vast maze of
the hallowed halls of &quot;THE ARCHIVES&quot; to ensure a wise rout........
