Clara inquires:

&gt; As I have my barndoors floor mat out and it is unlikely I can find a
decent
&gt; replacement, and it is old and torn,  anyone ever happily repair one?   I
&gt; hate moving it around.  The glycerin really does help soften it up, much
&gt; better than yesterday it is, but that does not heal rips.  That black
rubber
&gt; cement?  superglue?  Anyone done this?
&gt;

McMaster-Carr sells a 2 part urethane cement in single use packets. It is
black and very convincing in it's holding power. I once glued the sole back
on a friend's hiking boot during the middle of a backpacking trip. It held
for the balance of the trip and is still holding 3 years later. Great stuff
for flexible bonds.
