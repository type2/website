Well it seems that my server isn't delivering my email to me for 
whatever reason. But I see that the ones I send are making it to the 
list. So I'm reading online at type2_dot_com.

I've looked at this thing and can't find a tine slotted screw 
anywhere. Am I blind? Here's the part number on the handle:
  211. (3 or 8) 2 (0 or 9) . 231.A.
Sorry, those middle three numbers are hard to read.
This is the &quot;T&quot; handle for the rear hatch.
