Subject: Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel pump in 1600DP

	I had not planned to remove the motor (1600DP w/ doghouse
cooler), but a broken exhaust stud changed that.  Now I am planning to
re-install my motor, I am thinking about improvements I would like to
make.  One &quot;improvement&quot; I would like to make is to install the stock
metal fuel line that goes from the front (FIF) of the engine tin around
the fan housing to the fuel pump.  I once bought a metal fuel line that
was supposed to serve this purpose, but I could not figure out any way
to make fit on my motor.
	I know that the place where the metal fuel line passes through
the front tin is an historic problem area, but I believe that there are
adequate fixes for this (Bob Hoover had one involving lamp parts and, I
think I recall that veewee111 recommends wrapping the fuel line w/
bicycle inner tube).  I think that, in the event of an engine fire, I'd
rather have metal fuel line running through the engine compartment.
	Anyway, I have never seen a motor in person or detailed pictures
with this fuel line installed.  I have two questions:

	1)  Are there any detailed pictures anywhere showing this fuel
line installed.  I vaguely understand that it bends around the fan
housing.  I don't understand exactly how it is routed.  Did the location
of the hole in the front tin move over time?  I don't understand how the
metal fuel line connects to the fuel pump.

	2)	Does anyone sell this metal fuel line with the correct
shape for the doghouse cooler?  Is there a different shape for doghouse
coolers?

	Thanks for your help,

	Michael
