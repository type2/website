thanks for the input craig

my last regulator went out in texas. When I got to california i pulled the

to quote our hero's post from &quot;Doomed&quot;

&quot;The next day they took the nuts off of the back of the generator and cut
notches in them with the hack saw to use a screwdriver and backed out
the face plate enough to put in a collar between it and the pulley and
used the press to remove the pulley. After which the coil poles were
removed from the housing to reveal the fried on the inside coils. A
committee was formed and the vote put up for our hero to get a new
generator. The consensus was a unanimous yea polling.
The fresno trip yielded a brand spanking new generator&quot;

On the way home with lights going out i parked and spent the night  along side
highway 36.
I then limped out to and drove up 101 until the battery gave out.
 I sat there until a friendly and knowledgeable non list member helped me out
with a lift to san jose.
[(I was helped by a *SOTO* member to all you flamers) a self described friend
of Dave H**d]
I charged up the battery, got a ride back to the Kombi, installed the battery
and limped to my aunt's house.
I have been using a charger at night to keep my bus operable..

I did a no load generator test per the Idiot Book the new generator puts out
big time.
I also installed a D- to D- grounding wire

Could someone please pull their regulator and see if that middle contact is two
sided as pe my original regulator post question.

Mahalo
