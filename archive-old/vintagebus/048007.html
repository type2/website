I'd like to say these are The Bomb, and you guys know how critical I can be
of repro parts.  I have a set of these in the '60, and another set on ice
for the '54
 - -=  = == 
hm- I thought BD wiper shafts were diff than late split. yes 58 parts list  
agrees.  deal is that the BD wiper shafts are longer than the 55-64 ones.  
Not sure how this will affect trying to fit a later shaft in a bd.

So these are reproed, not rebuildt.   Well,do someshameless plugs at the 
bottom of your posts.  What do you sell them for anyhow?
