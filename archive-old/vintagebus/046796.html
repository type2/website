Hi everyone,

I know it's not friday, but a guy at work today said someone bungie jumped a 
VW bus off the Golden Gate Bridge today in San Francisco.
Can anyone support this or is it a BS rumor.
I tried channel surfing and checking local internet sites for info, but 
nothing.
I want to see some pics or hear some truth.
Anyone got some.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
