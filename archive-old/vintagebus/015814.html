Seems to me someone on the list was looking for parts books for the split 
bus.  Well, EBAY (insert groans here) has one going for a decent price right 
now....  $12.00

Just thought others might be intersted.

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=300265127

Note this is not my auction so I have no other information other than what 
is in the ad.

Note he also has a lot of other VW books for sale.

Enjoy,
Mike
