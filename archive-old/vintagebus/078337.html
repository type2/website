&gt;&gt;How does everybody clear out a blocked heat riser?
&gt;
&gt;I took a piece of old clutch cable and put it on the end of a power
&gt;drill.

This is about what I did, along with some pieces of stiff wire that
I poked in there manually.  Caution: Be careful of the clutch cable!
If the far end gets stuck, you can wind it up quite a bit with the
drill and it will unwind pretty quick when you take your finger off
the trigger on the drill.  Just be ready for it.

I had the muffler and the rear apron off, but the bumper still on.

Muir said to work on it (OFF THE CAR) until there was a little hole
through the blockage, then heat it with an oxy-acetylene torch until
red hot, then give it a blast of oxygen from the torch to burn out
the carbon.  I have no idea if this works or not.
