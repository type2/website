A coffee mug holder hunh.  I've got several designs for these.  The current
one I use in my daily driver, rusted through, waiting to be restored , 67
Westy is simple and easily formed to fit a variety of mugs or cans or water
bottles.  In as much as this bus was already hacked up a bit when I got it,
I went with pop rivets to fasten the holder to the front, left corner of the
dash.  It takes 3 1/8 dia. rivets.  Someone already cut up the radio hole so
I didn't mind drilling a few holes in the dash.  As a retired engineering
tech in aircraft instrumentation,  I've had some fun designing little
accessories like a log book holder, various brackets for stuff, and some
hardware for the top luggage rack.  The problem with designing stuff away
from the fabrication shops I had before I retired is that now I have to
produce drawings and submit the job to the private sector shops.  This
results in pretty stiff prices for just one or two items.  For example the
log book racks came to about $38.00 each.  These are just like a map case
 and attaches behind the drivers seat on the bulkhead, again with pop rivets
or sheetmetal screws and made out of aluminum, .06 thick.  Drop me a line
off the list I guess and I could send you a sketch or drawing if you would
like to make one.  They are pretty easy to make.
