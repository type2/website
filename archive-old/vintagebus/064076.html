Subject: Flip Seat parts and Delog front winshields

Ok so recently I asked if anyone had a flipseat table or other flipseat only
parts for sale. As when I asked the list about a tent no one stepped forward
until I offered up some stash parts for trade so, I am doing it again to try
to acquire parts.

I have a set of NOS Delog front windshields
A NOS Stewart Warner gas heater,
A pair of NOS tail light assemblies 59 (I think) to 61 (screw type)
A 62 / 63 middle seat,
As well as $$$ and other sought after items.

I am specifically looking for flip seat only table and leg, a chandelier,
the 3 water bottles, and the folding chair. Please let me know if you have
anything
Thanks
Shawn
