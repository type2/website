&gt; I just go off the phone with NTB and they said that a Dunlop D60

&gt;those type of tires are a rough ride.  The H speed rating is a stiffer 
&gt;tire that would stop the &quot;mushy&quot; response in my bus.  Has anybody 
&gt;purchased a six ply tire and been satisfied with it?  Is it correct to 
&gt;think that a  higher speed rated tire would provide better handling?  
&gt;And is 195/70 R14 correct for my 66 bus?

The Dunlop D60 A2 is a fine tire.  But it's still a passenger car tire.
Go to the tire store and ask them to show you one of these in the
195/70/14 size and look on the sidewall for the load rating.  My guess
is that it will say something like 1350 or maybe even 1400 lbs.  Most
good quality passenger tires fall within that range.  

I've got a set of Michelin p-car tires on my 73 that have a load rating
of 1420.  And while I feel comfortable that these will stand up to the
loads that I typically carry (assuming I keep them properly inflated and
inspect them periodically - just like with any tire), the sidewalls flex
a lot more than I'd like them to.  This gives me a somewhat mushy
feeling while driving.  When I feel I've gotten enough miles or years
service from them, I WILL be replacing them with a set of light truck
tires.

Light truck tires have VERY stiff side walls and often have a max air
pressure of 45 and up.  And their load ranges tend to be 1500 and up.
These will provide a much more stable ride in a bus than their softer
passenger cousins will.  

The speed rating of a tire does NOT indicate a stiffer sidewall.  The V
and Z rated tires do tend to be stiffer, but that's typically due to the
fact that they are usually low-profile tires (50 series).  The speed
rating has more to do with the rubber compound and how much heat it can
withstand before it begins to soften and break down.

The tire guy's job is to sell tires.  Your job is to make sure he sells
you the RIGHT tire.  As long as you're spending the money for a good set
of tires, try to find a light truck tire in a 195/75/14 size.
