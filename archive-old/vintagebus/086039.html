Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

If I loosen the steering box adjuster the tightness goes away but the free  
play increases. The original box didn't do that it just had alot of freeplay.  
The 2nd had less freeplay but, had a tight spot that made it unsafe to drive.  
The 3rd has less of a tight spot but, still too much for me with 4 klids and  
wife while towing a small poptop trailer while being passed by tractor 
trailers.  The center pivot has been replaced. The drag link. 2 tierod ends. I don't 
think  the king and links would do that but, worth the check. Any leads on 
good  steering box rebuilders??? I own a shop but, haven't been able to find the 
 rebuild parts.
