&gt; Help Please,
&gt;  I have a 1600 DP with dual Webers (bought new about 2 months ago). It idles
&gt;  rough. Cylinders 3 &amp; 4 seem to be not firing all that well. If I pull the
&gt;  plug wires one at a time from the dizzy, you can't tell much difference on 
3
&gt;  &amp; 4, but you can tell alot of difference on 1 and 2. I replaced the plugs
&gt;  and wires last night. It didn't seem to make improvement at all. My
&gt;  question, could the carb on that side not be supplying the right mixture of
&gt;  fuel and thereby making those two cylinders not fire correctly?? What else
&gt;  can I look for? The engine has only 2700 miles since rebuild. Any help or
&gt;  suggestions would be helpful.
&gt;  
yes- your carb could be off-   evidently dual carbs are attention demanding.  
 Now why would someone put in the pointless ignition to save futzing with the 
bus, then put in dual carbs?  BUt they do go good when they go good.  need 
one of those unisynch things too.
