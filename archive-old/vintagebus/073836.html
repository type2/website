&gt; ps. we are making another trip to THE YARD in a couple weeks
&gt; 

Maybe its just me, but what good does that do anybody looking for heater
parts?  Unless there is a phone # or address that goes along with it I
don't want to know.  Are you offering to pick up the parts or did you
just forget to type the phone #/address ;-)  Good thing I don't need SW
parts.
