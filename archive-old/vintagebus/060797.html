 Hi Thomas,
 If you just need gaskets you can make them out of simular thickness paper 
 with an Exacto knife.

I'll second that.  the gaskets seemed to be hard to find, and five bucks a 
piece if I wanted to wait for them to be ordered.   I traced the cover on a 
paper grocery sack.  You can trace the inside with a little difficulty by 
putting the pencil through the axle hole.  Punched the holes with a punch and 
then cut along the lines with scissors.  Voila!   gasket!
