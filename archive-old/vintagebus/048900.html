Happy Friday Volks:

I have a question about door handle trim rings.  Is the trim ring/piece on an early bus cargo door handle the same as the trim ring/piece on the rear hatch T handle?  The piece I'm talking about is the round sleeve that fits between the exterior of the door and the handle itself.

TIA.

Robert
