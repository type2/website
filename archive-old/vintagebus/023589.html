&lt;&lt; Anyone have any luck using their AAA plan to move a project car around &gt;&gt;

I haven't moved a project car around, but an old girlfriend of mine broke 
down in Oklahoma, and had AAA come out five times in a row on her mother's 
AAA card to get her back to Albuquerque, but then again, she was a good 
looking young woman, therefore, get your girlfriend to have the vehicle 
towed.  How many tow truck drivers are female?
