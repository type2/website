Subject: sundail windows ***utdate***
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

im gonna be sending out a pic. of the windows later in the week. I have to 
find it first. The windows will not fit in the stock frames, there for the 
panels that have been cut.
There in good shape thoe the plastic guid used to open the windows have been 
lost in two of them, i found them at a local camper/ trailer shop, Im shure 
there not very hard to find at a place near you. What i want is to take the 
windows out and have the holes filled in. If any one has the means to do so 
mabey we could work somthing out!
