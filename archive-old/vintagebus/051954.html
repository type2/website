I say good for you Thom. I have got more info from
your site than any of the &quot;gods&quot; sites. Do they even
have one? I have had a hard enough time getting parts
for a Westfalia before. I fade in and out in regard to
my participation in VW events because of some of the
crap that one has to deal with. I too would love a
barndoor but, like you, would find no comfort in
groveling for anything! Well, except maybe for that
trailer you are building....

&gt; One of the things that soured me on the whole
&gt; barndoor restoration bit was
&gt; the strain of trying to buy parts.  Not a
&gt; *financial* strain, but the sheer
&gt; amount of social engineering and bulls*t that I had
&gt; to go thru to get relatively
&gt; simple stuff from the parts whores.  That, and the
&gt; 'community' seemed to look
&gt; down on me because I was doing the work myself
&gt; instead of having CH or LC 
&gt; or one of the other gods do it.  Screw it.
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to spend more quality time - and money -
&gt; with the 911.  Some parts
&gt; are more expensive, but I don't have to grovel for
&gt; them before I overpay.  I
&gt; think the 911 folx as a community are as good or
&gt; better than bus folk.  A guy
&gt; on Rennlist's wife has to have an expensive medical
&gt; treatment, and they
&gt; raised $1500+ for her in about 12 hours.
