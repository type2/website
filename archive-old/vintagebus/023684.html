Subject: Type IV oil cooler in type I??

I heard that the doghouse fanshroud can be modified to accomodate a type
iv oil cooler
which is reported to be bolt-on compatible.

The type iv oil cooler is reported to be more efficient and somewhat
larger.

Apparently this mode was discussed in a recent VW rag.

Does anyone know more about the mod?
Does anyone know which rag/issue?

Thanks,
...Markus
