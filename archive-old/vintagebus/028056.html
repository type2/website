I have the CE safaris and like them.  Greg Noble/Frankie Hill
also bought a set.  Your best bet is to get up a 0-dark-thirty
and call.

&gt; have been advised that the repo ones are not necessarily the top choice.
&gt; But the original ones are so hard to come by. On the other hand, I
&gt; followed a link to the Creative Engineering site and requested info
&gt; about their repo, which is said to be the best, 'completely
&gt; interchangable' w/ the original style.... No replies after 4 emails in
&gt; the past week. Did you get yours from this source Thom? How can I get in
&gt; touch w/ them? I know Kelly Park is coming up, but you know how it is w/
&gt; family budget funds -- if I don't hurry up to spend it on one thing it'd
&gt; be eaten up by some other things. Help my bus get the great assesories
&gt; it deserve!
