Subject: Re: [VB] Sump

It is an oil system where the oil is kept in a separate tank, rather than
in a sump at the bottom of the engine.  There is a second oil pump that
removes all oil from the sump and stores it in a tank.  The oil from the
tank is then pulled through the normal oil pump and sent to the bearings.

&gt; Hey, what is dry sump? I've heard of this in relation to (very

&gt;   ...In FSV's with the original 1600CC type4, the
&gt; rules allowed us to dry sump the engine which eliminated the problem.
