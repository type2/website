&gt;Has anyone ever done the old 'look down the carb at WOT' to 
&gt;see if the butterfly is/was completely vertical and perpendicular 
&gt;with the crab base and found out that with the petal to the 
&gt;metal your bus wasn't getting all it's allotted power?

When I bought my 73 Westy, I was a little disappointed at its ability (or
lack thereof) to climb even the mildest of grades on the highway without
dropping from 60mph down to 45mph.  After about 2 weeks of ownership, I
discovered that with the pedal to the metal the butterfly on the scrawny
little carb was only opening about 2/3 the way.  After adjusting the cable,
the difference was incredible.  I was hitting 0-60 in under 20 seconds
instead of 30!  Who says there's no such thing as 'free horsepower'??
