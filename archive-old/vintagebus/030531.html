&gt; Upon further inspection it turns out the bus is a '63, but has the
&gt; SO-42 interior. I'm not a camper guy, but I thought the SO-42 was a
&gt; '65 thing. And the Westy tag says '66. Did this ever happen where an
&gt; older bus went back and got set-up with the westy stuff....or did
&gt; someone just do a camper transplant. The pop-top looks good...not
&gt; llike a hack. But there is a camper window where one of the closets
&gt; is...kinda making me think it was a transplant.

Rex,

One sure way to tell if you have a original SO 42 Westy is to look at the
M-plate for a &quot;B&quot; code (A,B or C denoted the package) and also to look on
the over head vent plaque (does a 63 have one???).  I've never seen a &quot;42&quot;
in a small hatch bus (pre '64).  That and the fact that you said the brass
Westfalia factory ( on the Z-bed) tag says '66 says to me that this is
indeed a retro fit into an earlier bus.

Pull up the flooring behind the passenger seat (where the icebox would have
been) and look for a 3&quot; hole punched (not cut) in the cargo floor.  All
SO-42 busses had this hole, as it was for the icebox drain petcock and hose.

How does the passenger side closet fit in the rear with the small hatch?
Good find though.

Steve
