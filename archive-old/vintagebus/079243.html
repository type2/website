Subject: Re: [VB] INSURANCE

  I have 4 buses with Farmers and pay 165 every 6 months for liability only. When I move a couple over to Pollmans 
they will cost 100 for the first bus and 75 for the second, PER YEAR, full coverage, stated value! My wifes 65 bug is 100 
per year 8000 dollars stated value, modified vehicle and the oval 75 dollars 10K stated value, modified.
   The deal is you have to have other daily drivers insured as primary. I have the tow ford and my wife has the PT as 
our primary

&gt;I was quoted $300 every 6 months with State Farm (my carrier) for just
&gt;liability for my bus.  I would like full coverage if someone takes off with my
&gt;ride.
&gt;Is there any companies for AZ drivers someone can recommend?
&gt;
&gt;How much are you paying for Bus Insurance?
&gt;With who?
