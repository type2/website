Subject: poppin' outta 4th

I do hate to reveal my ignorance but ...... maybe it'll help someone else.

I was popping outta 4th a few times and I was quite concerned that my
transaxle was on it's last legs - I no longer think that's the case.  I
recently noticed that I only pop out when I'm in 4th gear and driving at
about 30 mph or less.  That is, when I'm driving at the appropriate speed
for 4th gear I don't pop out - when I'm lugging the engine I do pop out.

Hey, confession is good for the soul.

FWIW
