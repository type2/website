First of all go look at an oil coller on a 911 Porsche or even better a 64
356 Carrera Porsche, or even better a Sea-Trab oil cooler. ALL of these have
the same fin placement as the tight finned type 3 oil cooler. They are also
useing these to cool WITHOUT forced air, Think about it. The cars (engines)
that use these types of coolers have more money in a couple of parts in
there engines then our whole upright engine would cost new!  This is an
argument that can go on forever, but we should have real numbers in the next
couple weeks as there are now 4 people here in 110 degree Havasu with or in
the process of using the tight finned type 3 cooler.

ronnie
currently out of the type3 tight finned coolers.

 There is a type 3 cooler that has more fins to it than the later doghouse 
 cooler.  They both have the same amount of tubes through them so there is
no 
 differance in internal surface area for the oil to slide up against and 
loose 
 it's heat.  We have wondered why VW gave up on this type 3 cooler when they

 came out with the doghouse system for the upright engine in 1971.  They 
 should have had had the tooling availible since the type 3 cooler came out 
 much earlier than 1971.  Our guess is that the tighter finning caused the 
 cooling air to have more problems going through it.  When cooling air 
removes 
 heat it must expand.  Too much heat to remove and/or too tight an area to 
 pass through and the amount of air you can push through it gets to be less 
 and less.  Making the cooler less and less effective.

aw, come on Ronnie, what do you say to that? 

better get some tests and see what is really cooler.
