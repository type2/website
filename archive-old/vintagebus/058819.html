Subject: RE: [VB] Has anyone noticed the continuing BFY lie?

For what it's worth.

It takes a minimum of 3 months advance to get an ad changed in Hot VW. My ad
has been incorrect for the last 5 issues and I think this new issue they
finally have it right.

Hey Mike,
Bait and Switch is when a vendor has an item advertised at a really low
price, and seems to be out of the item when you call or visit, but tries to
sell you the more expensive model.

BFY isn't really doing that, since they don't have a more expensive part or
model to sell you.

Traditionally, advertisers try to get one ad to last for as long as
possible-to avoid production costs.  Bottom line-they are in business to
make as much profit as possible.  Often times, it costs as much to remove
one item from an ad as it does to create a whole new ad.  Obviously, keeping
costs down can and often is passed on to the consumer (us) in the form of
reasonable prices.

I deal with BFY pretty regularly.  They offer great services that nobody
else does-such as pressing new rubber and vent wing glass into your frames
using the press they have.  And they do it at a reasonable price too.  Also,
their staff, like most reputable suppliers, are quick to offer sound advice,
for which they may or may not get your business as a result of.

I'm sure that the last thing that BFY, or anybody who is reputable, wants to
do is to be dishonest or underhanded.  What could BFY possibly gain by
leaving the unavailable part in their ad?

Don't mean this to be a flame, and I hope you won't flame me back.  Sounds
like you've made a lot of calls to both BFY and to the magazine in question.
Again, what would the magazine gain by running this ad?  Was the magazine
even aware of the content of the ad when you spoke to them?  I don't think
that running or not running the ad has too much to do with the magazine's
policies, Mission Statement,  philosophy, etc.

It sounds like you're really frustrating yourself with this whole issue.
With all due respects, maybe you should go out and adjust your valves, or
feel your tools, or whatever, and just relax.

Remember, this is supposed to be fun.

Ed

&gt; FW: Has anyone noticed the continuing BFY lie? The May issue of Hot VWs
&gt; arrived at my door today and I was very disappointed to see the same BFY
&gt; ad--BFY has not had the European bus assemblies since August (seven
months)
&gt; and they continue to listing them.  How is this different from bait and
&gt; switch advertising that every state considers illegal?
&gt;
&gt; I've called BFY a few times (August, November, December, February &amp; March)
&gt; to see if they actually found some new headlight assemblies and I get the
&gt; same answer-they sold all the assemblies quickly and did not anticipate
&gt; getting any more.  Last month the guy on the other end of the phone
offered
&gt; a lame excuse about the difficulties of working with his artist.
&gt;
&gt; I've also contacted Hot VWs about this-I spoke to someone in the
advertising
&gt; department in mid-February and spoke to and wrote a letter to the managing
&gt; editor in mid-March.  But the ad still runs.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming that truthful advertising offers information, product offerings,
&gt; and pricing, what value does this BFY ad offer readers?  What does this
say
&gt; about the true mission of Hot VWs?  What does this say about BFY's
business
&gt; practices?
&gt;
&gt; I know the answer.  Both are lame.
&gt;
&gt; Disappointed and still tilting at windmills,
&gt;
