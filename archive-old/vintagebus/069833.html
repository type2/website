Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

You know, sometimes you just can't take em off no matter how ugly.

The PO of our 65 westy put scoops on our bus. didn't bother me too much when
I
checked it out to buy it. Was not a fan of the scoop... looks cool on some
junky
busses i've seen, figured i'd just take em off. These were mounted halfway
back on the vents.
Not a bad way to scoop if your gonna.

The bus was otherwise completely solid and uncut. no rust. cool.
Pulled over often to check on the motor on the drive home.
Runnin cool as a cucumber. great!
Cut to me gassin up 100 miles later... my eye wanders
to the inside reaches of that perfectly painted scoop.
There's about a dozen quarter size holes neatly cut out of the body
just behind the vents. nifty!
Have to say though, it's the coolest running bus i've ever had.
This thing hauls ass and never gets too hot touch the dipstick.


Moral of the story?
You should cut a bunch of holes in the side of your
bus and put scoops over em ;)
