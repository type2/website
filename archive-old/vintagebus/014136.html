I bought both my busses in another country, and I know lots of people on the 
list have bought busses from other countries. What is the issue here? To 
sell or not to sell or having your bus leave the country? I agree that if 
you put your bus up for sale and somebody is willing to give you what you 
want then everyone wins. If they happen to live in another country...big 
deal.
Just my two cents.
