Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

Yes, it was my bus (67 21DLX) Ronnie of Old Volks was working on in his shop
that had a new GEX 1600 DP, fully balanced motor with hardly any miles on
it. As you know, the motor was not cracked up to what it was supposed to be
(poor oil pressure, no power, missing, etc.,). Ronnie is very knowledgeable
and truly in tune with the whole bus mechanics thing. Right off the bat,
after driving my bus around, Ronnie &quot;spotted&quot; and &quot;identified&quot; many problems
that were perplexing me greatly.

Ronnie went out of his way to deliver my Bus to me in time for OCTO. With a
Ronnie 1776 motor, everything balanced, with rebuilt trans and a slight
gearing upgrade (including a new steering box), shift rod rebuild, RGB
rebuild and many other corrections/upgrades including new brake lines, I
can't believe the difference in driving. I have to admit, in the past, I
enjoyed looking at the bus much more than driving it. Now, it drives sooo
sweet down the road I truly have the best of both worlds now. To top it off,
Ronnie will be working with me on motor maintenance tips and upkeep, helping
me to increase my knowledge of Bus maintenance.

Burning Man: Any busses going to Burning Man? This event screams VW bus
theme. You can find info at www.Burningman_dot_com. This is a big event
featuring an experiment in temporary community for one week, located north
of Reno, NV. The organizers encourage a &quot;theme&quot; camp. I am going this year
(August 27-September 3rd) to check it out, thinking about next year. I see
having a big bus camp theme, with some sort of Bus/VW art expo, giving the
public a look see at what most of us experience at most every bus event. We
could &quot;wagon train&quot; our camp and place VW bus items around and other related
items and really make it an event (I'm I going mad?). This can be a chance
to let others &quot;outside&quot; our hobby get some interaction/exposure with a VW
art twist. Any who are interested, let me know!!

That's all the news that's fit to print.
