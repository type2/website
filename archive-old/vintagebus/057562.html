Subject: WTB: Splash pan

Does anyone out there in listland have a decent splash
pan I can buy?  I've looked all over the place with no
luck.  I'm just looking for one that isn't too crusty
or is repairable.  I need it for a 66 Double Cab if
that makes any difference.

Thanks,
Paul near Buffalo, NY
