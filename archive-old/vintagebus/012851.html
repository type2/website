Once upon a time, the headmechanic came over and asked what I was doing, in
his strong German accent   (I was drilling out the rivets)

I heard something about Dumkopff and then watched the master, he pulled out
his small cold chisel and magic Stallwille hammer and BAM, BAM, 2 hits and
it went flying, shook his head and walked off.  Of course it took me 6 or 8
blows the first time, now one or two is all it takes.  Save your drill
bits, and rim. Watch out for flying objects!
