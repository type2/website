&gt; Okay, I scored a very clean bay window gas tank at Sacto BOR, to put in my 
&gt; 64 bus, and have seen the website that shows the filler neck mods to put it 
&gt; in, but as far as the gas gauge goes, do any of you know if the bay window 
&gt; sender will work with a splitty gauge?

Hi Eric,
Our 63SC is running a 6 volt system, battery &amp; gauge, but is using the 
1968-71 tank and 12 volt sender.  Works perfectly even with a reserve switch 
installed in it.  It is so nice, if we run it out of fuel we can just slide 
under the passenger side of our SC and flip to reserve by hand.  Someday will 
either rig up a stock reserve cable or an after market one hidden away.  Also 
nice because one can shut off fuel to the engine when parking in a bad 
nieghborhood or when removing the engine or just replacing all flexable fuel 
lines!
