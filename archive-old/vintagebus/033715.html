The kits that WW will be selling are from Brazil, I haven't seen them but
heard that they are the gits out of a new Brazilian box (that does not work
in a bus).
The price on the kit is around $150.00 plus. It will be interesting to see
these as rebuilding a box properally requires some machining (so I have been
told).

&gt; is wolfsburg going to sell the box rebuild parts or
&gt; only use them in
&gt; their own rebuilds?

The kit is listed in their latest catalog, but is not
quite available yet.  So it will be sold as a rebuild
kit.  I'd rather do it myself anyway...
