Subject: My Bus Won't Always Start
Message-ID: &lt;372dcbc4My Bus Won't Always Start*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;The other day i was driving on the freeway and my fan belt snaped
&gt;ever since then my bus has only been starting on occasion... There seems
&gt;to be no rhyme or reason for when it will or will not start...
 &gt;the wierd thing is that if you jump it... it starts... its almost like it
takes more then
&gt;12v to start it or somthing...
&gt;I also was thinking that I may have  possibly put the belt on too tight?
&gt;is that a possibility? it seems to have a little play in it like it had
before.
&gt;but would it affect the starting if it was to tight? hmmm... I know
&gt;you cant tell to well with out looking at it but any ideas would be greatly
appreciated!
&gt;Thanks a lot! -ChrisPoage

Chris,
sounds like your fan belt broke for whatever reason (too tight, too worn out,
or worse), then
when you installed the new one, maybe it wasn't tightened enough?  a loose
fan belt will appear
okay and deflect properly, but after a trip you'll see that the sides of the
belt are shiny from slipping
and the dipstick is too hot to touch. The motor starts a slow burn towards
overheating this way.

Take your bus out of gear with the engine off and turn the motor with a
wrench on the generator nut by
hand, all the way through the cycle. Does the bottom pulley stop turning and
slide along the belt at any
point? If you have particularly good compression the crank is harder to turn
and the belt could slip easier.

Anyway, when you overheat like this, your bus won't start again right away
(hot starting) you have to sit and
wait for a long time. The normal reaction is to keep trying and flood the
motor. anyway look for a hot engine,
the solution to this problem is to tighten the fan belt more, or replace the
belt with a new one.
that's my .02cents
