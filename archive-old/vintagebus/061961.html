&gt; I have a floor jack and stands, but do not know the proper way to use (where 
&gt; to place jack?) them with an old bus.

Hi Tom,
The strongest and best place for the jack and especially the jack stands is 
under the torsion bar tubes!  Anywhere else will bend up if you have a heavy 
load in/on your bus and/or any rusted sheet metal.  Of course make sure to 
block the wheels of the axle you are not jacking up at the time.
