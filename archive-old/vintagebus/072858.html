Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Rims

Just for comparison, they usually go for around $10-$25 depending on
condition and size or date.  Crows foot rims I think go for more.  This
is of course with no tire removal or shipping costs.

Lets see now:
#1) Take the rim to the tire store, have the tire removed $7.50 + Tax
#2) Leave the old tire there $3.00 recycling fee
#3) Drive around dumpster diving until I find a box.
#4) Bring the thing home and pack it.
#5) Take it to UPS and ship it.
Go ahead and sell yours for $10.00
I'll hang on for a better price on mine, at lease $50.00 + shipping.
