I think most of them were based on kombis.
They have hardboard roof panels in the cab, 
But, westfalia ordered their busses special, so form day one they are 
destined to be a camper.
Now that I think about it, my friends old 58 kombi had sigla glass, so dous 
my friends 60 dd kombi.
Another factor into the equation.

Ahh, but you have an early Westy (at least earlier than the SO42/44  series
I'm familiar with) .  Weren't those based on standards?  You know two tone
paint and all.

But I could be full of it for all I know.
