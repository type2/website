Looking at the photos it looks like the same as VWHowards, his has the same
wheel set up except his wheel is aluminum, but the same arms and spring
setup.

Subject: [VB] Single Wheel Trailer


I was given a single wheel trailer recently.  It didn't have a bed or
box just the frame. Can anyone give me any info on it?  What type of box
it should have had?  It is marked with &quot;trail car&quot; or &quot;trailer car&quot;.
Here are some pictures.

Thanks.
