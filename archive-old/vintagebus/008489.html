So I ordered some stuff from California Imports about a 1 1/2 months ago.  I
ordered it so I would have everything I thought I twould need to take to my
SO's parents place to pull my motor transaxle etc.. so I could do some
stuff.  I asked if the parts would be sent right away and if they had
everything in stock - they said yes so ...... I waited ....  but of course
the stuff didn't arrive the following week I called them and they said that
they were just filling my order - &quot;WHAT&quot; I said, you said you would send it
right away and that I should have had it by Friday, now I missed my
opportunity to do this work at my in-laws and I'm stuck pulling my motor and
transaxle in the backyard,  &quot;you guys screwed my&quot; I said.  He said: &quot;look,
do you want the stuff or not.&quot;  I was really P'd off but what could I do.


So, I ordered some brakes and a few other things from Bowwow_dot_ca, also in BC
and the stuff arrived right away.

So last week I needed a few other things and I noticed that California
Imports web site (http://vwcalimports_dot_com/) says &quot;In Stock Shipped in 24
hours Guaranteed.&quot;  So I know they are liars since they lied to me already
but on Monday Bowwow_dot_ca was not open and I wanted to get my bus back on the
road by this weekend so .... I called the liars.
 I said:  &quot;I notice that your web site says that you guarantee to ship in
stock items within 24 hours.&quot;
 &quot;Yes, he says.&quot;
So I said: &quot;what kind of guarantee is that.&quot;
&quot;What do you mean,&quot;  Says he.
&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;Is it any sort of real guarantee or is it just some hollow
promise that you tell people to get their money.&quot;
&quot;No, it is a real promise,&quot;  he said.
&quot;Well, I've ordered from you guys before and my stuff wasn't shipped within
24 hours.&quot;
&quot;We can only ship in 24 hours if we have what you order in stock.&quot;
&quot;OK,&quot; I said.  &quot;I don't want to argue with you&quot;
(last time they told me what I ordered was in stock and they still didn't
ship for almost a week)
&quot;But,&quot; he says:  &quot;Today is a holiday and we cant ship today.&quot;
&quot;OK&quot; I said:  &quot;Then you'll have my stuff out on Tuesday?&quot;
&quot;YES,&quot; he says.
&quot;OK&quot;  I said.  &quot;Then I'll take ...... and ship it with Tiger Courier&quot;
&quot;OK&quot; he says.

Well, I called them on Thursday to make sure everything went as they said it
would and of course my stuff wasn't shipped on Tuesday at all.  They tell me
it was shipped on Wednesday ..... by mail. So here I sit unable to put my
transaxle and motor in because I ordered parts from Liars.  Please tell me
how that is 24 hours?  They are lairs.  Bowwow has never let me down so from
now on I only order from Bowwow_dot_ca.
