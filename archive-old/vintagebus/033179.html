Hi everyone,

With all the talk the last couple of days about Double Cab rear seats, I feel
the urge to mention that the Arizona Bus Club needs a rear seat and stand for
the '65 DC we are fixing up to raffle off at next September's Jerome Jamboree.
I realize the chances of getting one are fairly slim, but I gotta give it a
shot.  Who knows, maybe some one DOES actually have one they can part with
fairly reasonably.  With everything we plan to do with the 'raffle truck',
it'll suck to hear all the comments when everyone sees it with a regular seat
in it.

Anyway, hope to see some of you at Buses by the Bridge!!!

Jon
ABC
'61 DC
