Having been a member of the type 2 (bay list) for a while I decided to jump 
over here for a spell...actually the purchase of a 60 single cab has prompted 
the move.

I am needing a few things....specifically a 6v flywheel, '66 year, so that it 
will accommodate a 6v starter and a 200 mm clutch (on a 1600 DP motor).

also i need to speak to someone who actually has put in a 1600 in an early 
trans.  i am not going to hog out the bell housing to fit the bigger 
flywheel.  the combo i want to do as mentioned above will allow me to bolt 
the flywheel to the 1600 and the 1600 right to the '60 tranny, while still 
using the 6v starter.  so anything i will run into that i might not think 
of??  o-rings, problems with clutch?? etc?? 

thanks,
zac
