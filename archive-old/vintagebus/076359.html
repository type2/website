Subject: RE: [VB] Our classic VW's, not

PA:


 10 years old is classic. Yearly Inspection must occur, and the car must
have some 'intrinsic value' or collectabilty. Picture are required. I have
seen 1984 Fieros and Camaros, but no four door Buicks yet, with these
plates.

Antique: 25 years or older. No inspection. Car must represent as close as
possible original condition, proven with pics. Too custom and you wind up
with a street rod plate, but then it must RESEMBLE a 46 or 48, I forgot
which , and lower.

AL



   I was just informed through motor vehicles that VW's ARE NOT considered
classic cars. Motor vehicles bases there information on what is supplied to
them by CCCA (classic car club of america) I went down their list of
CLASSIC's and nowhere was VW to be found!!!!!!, but our motor vehicles does
consider them HISTORIC.
   It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic plate
requirements to see what other states think and/or use as their guideline
for classic car plates
