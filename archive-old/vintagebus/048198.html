&lt;&lt; From the remnants of what I pulled out of my '55, it looks like it went all
 the way to the area between the wheel wells.  Mine was too far gone to tell
 the thickness, but I used 5mm birch plywood.  It may have originally been
 3mm, like the door panels.
  &gt;&gt;

It is alot thicker than 5mm, it is like 3/4 of an inch or greater. And the
plywood goes back to just before the wheel wells. The bottom of the Z bed sits
on the steel floor if I remember correctly.
