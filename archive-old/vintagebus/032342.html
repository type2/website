I have a Bernie Bergman Stroker Crank in my speedy van... I have been very 
impressed with the feel and the smoothness of the idle.  I am also running 
MOFOCO 044 heads and the have been great as well.  No leaks, cracks and 
they stay relatively cool.  I didn't lighten the flywheel or anything like 
that, however I did have them 8-dowel it.  8 Doweling the flywheel isn't 
needed until you get over 1776cc.  So if you building anything smaller, 
don't waste your $$$$.
Lastly let me leave you with a few words of wisdom:
&quot;If it is an important piece, or if it is under extreme stress (Like a 
crank ...) spend the extra money, or have to do it all over again.&quot;
&quot;Speed costs money!  How fast would you like to go?&quot;

engine builders
On my next engine I want to balance it, does anyone have a preference as to
which counterweighted crank to use? Most seem to run around $150 is a scat
crank worth the extra money?
Anyone have any experience with lightened flywheels or would you have a stock
flywheel drilled for the extra dowels.
Lastly, anyone have experience with the big valve heads, I'm referring to the
CB 044 heads with 40mm valves, I like the idea of the extra meat in the heads
thanks all
