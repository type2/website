Subject: more engine questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

some one suggested i look in the vw book &quot;how to .
i did 
thanks but i still have some questions: first my book dosent talk about the 
25 hp.
im asuming they were from 50 to 53.
also i was looking at some heads that i bought and was hoping someone could 
point out what they are.   ( the book doesnt list these #'s and i was just 
wondering)


first       #113 101 373   flat intake 40hp
second  #113 101 371A flat intake 40hp? w/ round boses for rockers and female 
threaded inserts from underneath.
third     #113 101 373 A    angled single port 1600 Right?
