Subject: Wipers

I am wondering what other people are doing about their
wipers?  It seems the mail order catalogs only carry bug
shafts.  I have a complete, except for wipers arms and
wiring setup.  But the wiper shafts are rusted and don't
look to be in good shape.  They look like the PO screwed
with the wipers alot.  I don't want to buy a set to only
have them fall off.  I live in Arid-zona, but we do get the
rain shower.  Plus I travel up north during the winter and
don't want to reach out the window to scrap the snow off.
I just took the wiper assembly out, and I was wondering is
there a clip the goes on the motor shaft?  The arms from the
wiper motor to the shafts has a little bracket that attaches
to the motor shaft, but no clip, or screw. Not even a hole
for either.  How does it stay on the motor?  Is it pressed
on.  It seems that the splines might be messed up.  Help
please.
