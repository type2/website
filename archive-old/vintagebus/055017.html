Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Pump won't pump fuel.

Here's another thing to consider:  after all the fuel line and fuel pump
cleaning you did, it may be necessary to prime the pump.  I recently
rebuilt the original pump for my 67 DC (single screw on top) and also
replaced the piece of metal fuel line that goes into it.  Bus wouldn't
fire up after that, no gas coming out of the pump.  I took off the top
of the pump, filled it with gas, replaced top and recranked.  I did this
twice, and then it started back up and has been running fine since.

&gt; Yesterday my '66 quit about a block from home. I towed it home and found
&gt; that there was no fuel coming into the pump. I took out the cloth line and
&gt; replaced it, I ran a wire through the steel line and got some sediment from
&gt; the line that was probably causing the blockage. I took my air compressor
&gt; hose and blew through the fuel line to ensure that it is clear, fuel runs
&gt; freely into the pump. I also removed the fuel pump, cleaned and reassembled
&gt; it, there was no visible problem with the screens, membranes or springs. I
&gt; reinstalled the pump, replaced the cloth fuel line and fuel filter to the
&gt; carburetor. Clamped everything down and turned the engine...no fuel from the
&gt; pump. I took off the pump and as a test, I replaced it with a pump from a
&gt; recently running engine, same style pump, the one with four screws at the
&gt; top and the conical shaped screen behind the brass nut on the side.
&gt; With the second pump there is still no fuel coming out. I took off the pump
&gt; and checked the connecting rod, it rises and falls as the engine turns.
&gt; I'm stumped, any one got a suggestion???
