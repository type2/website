Subject: Bushing ID, Starter

Matt,

I just measured a starter bushing ID at .491. that was with my Mitutoyo
calipers so it will be + or - about .002.

Get  a good metal polish and polish the end of the starter shaft so that it
really shines like a mirror. I used some Wenol. Make sure you oil the
bushing. Use some 30wt. I have been told that non-detergent is best for the
porous type bushings.

Chris
