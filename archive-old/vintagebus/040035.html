A topic has been brought up on the vintageVW list that perhaps AIRS should 
be extended to all air cooled vintage and perhaps non-vintage VWs.  One 
thread had suggested an AIRS knockoff for non-type 2's in connection with a 
trip that one member was taking across the Northern U.S. but it seems that 
this is reinventing the wheel.  This type of logical extension or expansion 
can only be good, to further the &quot;cause&quot;.  Any thoughts ?  Suggestions ?  
Flames ?

Is there ostracism on this list for going over the top or off the edge of 
the civilized world?
