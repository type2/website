Hi again people. Well today my buddy and I went out and got some cypruss
tree logs. There were eight 10+ft. long logs. I guess they were about 100lbs
each.  My 67 Singlecab hauled it all fine, but could be better and I want to
get it as prepared as possible correclty the first time.  It has front and
rear swaybars, I suppose they are aftermarket?

I am familiar with Boge and KYB shocks, as well as the chaep coilovers, but
I want to really beef up the suspension.  Does anyone know if you can get
Boge Turbo Gas shocks, Bilsteins, Konis, or a quality coilover or shock that
will give better performance to a singlecab gone working truck/atv
campmobile?

If anyone knows where and or what, please let me know. Thanks folks.
