Sorry, now that I read the question more carefully, you need a hump
but you don't have a hole; makes it a bit more difficult, doesn't it?

I thought you asking if the *engine *lid* had the hole, ie church key...

&gt; &gt; I'm still looking for an engine lid for my 59 bus. But which lid is the
&gt; &gt; right one? The one that is straight all the way down? Or the one with the
&gt; &gt; hump at the top for the license plate light? My bus rolled out of the
&gt; &gt; factory in March of 59. So which one is the one? And does anyone have
&gt; &gt; one???? Also which apron is the right one? The one with the hole or no hole?
