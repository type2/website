Subject: Re: [VB] Bakersfield VW show report&amp; nuts

When junkyarding the nuts/bolts end up in my toolbox rather than on the 
junkyard ground.   So there are always some in the box.  And I have loads of spare 
hardware at home, which has come in handy.    I have loads of chrome pop out 
window screws, and  screws for holding on the 63 and earlier front door catch, 
and rear axle nuts and a big coffee can of lug nuts and still more.    Though 
recent I've gone and bought new hardware for things like rear hatch attaching. 
and some M6 bolts.


To bad that show wasn't a little later... like the weekedn after KP   oh well.

one as a spare. one more reason to carry a well
stocked break-down kit full of unusual stuff you
wouldn't normally think of carrying. or maybe it's
time to put a couple extra on those geneator stand
studs for an emergency like this.
