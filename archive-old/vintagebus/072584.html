Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Those 1/2&quot; lines scare me. If I was using a blue printed 30mm oil pump I
would
still not use 1/2&quot; lines. 3/8&quot; is as big as I will go to maintain oil
pressure.

Jeeze Guys, look at the 1/2&quot; fittings, they're 3/8&quot; inside the bore of
couplings and fittings.
How much of a nit picker can you be?
