Hey NQ,
I haven't sent ant replies to your previous messages 'cause I figured
you were just blowing steam at the BS. Sometime we just need to know
that we aren't alone in our misery. After reading your last post I'm
worried that this might be too overwhelming. 
First let me remind you of the ride you took in the Batmobile this
summer. I could see the fire in your belly. You were going to have a
splitty come hell or high water. It took me 2 years to get my bus to the
stage were I could win the ugliest vehicle award at the car show. I lost
one entire year to family finances and non-VW broken vehicles. I know
the anguish of delay. I also know the joy that come from serious
progress. Some things can not be hurried or helped. If there is one
thing I have learned from my other hobby, raising bonsai, it is
patience.  I have lost trees several years old :( Hard to take but I
will continue my efforts in both arenas
I want to offer both my encouragement and help. I think we all would
suggest that you accept the help from people that offer. Hang in there.
