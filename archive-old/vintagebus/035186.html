Subject: 205 dizzy

Wow what a difference it makes to use a vacuum advance dizzy!!!

I have been running around with a 009, merged exhaust, and Weber 34ICTs for
a while and decided to switch back to the stock stuff for better mileage and
easy maintenance.  I put on a 205 vacuum dizzy, 30PICT-3 carb on a DP intake
with reducer plate, and stock muffler with J-pipes.  Runs so smooth and
greater drivability too.  

The 009 is so poor for driving a bus.  On a Beetle it is fine but a bus is
too heavy to get off the line, especially since I have a heavily laden
westi.  

A buddy of mine constantly complains about poor driving in his '71 with a
similar setup as mine but with a 009 and he will not change to a vacuum
dizzy... Why? Why? Why?

As a side note the Weber 34 ICTs do have a vacuum port of the side so it can
run with a vacuum dizzy but I just chose to use a stock setup for now.

I must say that the 34ICTs with merged muffler did run great when you were
on the gas!!!  Woo hoo speed!  But just not very drivable with the 009,
always too low RPMs when you were cruising on the interstate and lugging the
motor.  I run 205/75/R14 tires which lower the 009 out of the power band
when cruising.  Granted I bet I can run 65MPH all day long though, just
guessing because the speedo is broke and so is the tach (damn VDO stuff)...
The tach is old as dirt so I guess I cannot blame it too much.

On a positive note I am ready for camping this weekend!  And almost better
than that is I timed the bus perfectly by ear last night!  Hocked up the
strobe and found it dead on 32 degrees...  Guess I can skip that step for
now on :)
