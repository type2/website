I'll be setting up the Contential General Tire booth for SEMA this year and
will see what I can find out about tires for busses and such from them.  The
area for tires is seperate from the rest of the show so, I'll also check
around and see what I can find from others also.   Floor plan shows all of
the North Hall for tire exhibits so, 285,000 sqft displays.  Somebody should
have something that fits the bill in all that area.
    Are any of you comming here for SEMA?  If so, I'm sure that those of us
here in Vegas ( Beto, Eric and myself) would be glad to help out with any
questions about the city and other such things( VW junkyards stc.).

Jon
