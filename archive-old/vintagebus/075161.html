Subject: Re: [VB] Re: door panels

&gt;I am not sure how they would be posted or &gt;reproduced. 
&gt;(ANYONE??)

Well,

I run Autocad at work and have access to plotters that can print sheets up to 42.5&quot; x 30&quot;.

If there was a resource that had OG schematics of the panels with or without dimensions, I would be willing to begin such a project.

I can produce files in the .dwg, .dwf, probably .pdf and I'm sure the compu-dorks out there can do better than me. 

Don't know where to find these original drawings, but I'm throwing my hat in the ring on the drafting/printing.

Billy
