Subject: since I have it apart

Since I have the starter and carb out....   Being that my bus is a 66 and 
has no backup lights, I picked up a backup light for a 67 bug at the 
swapmeet this weekend for 2 bucks.  It's one of those hella ones that attach 
to the bumper.  I have seen other busses with this type of light on them.  
Would this be the correct light to use or is there an aftermarket one?  If 
anyone else has done this, would I wire according to the 67 diagram?  I had 
thought just running a switch up front would be sufficient.
