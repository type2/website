Subject: Re: [VB] green light stays on...



&gt; You have the power wire to the idiot lights hooked
&gt; to #30 contant power 
&gt; instead of to where the #15 connection for the coil,
&gt; cut off solinoid, &amp; 
&gt; electric choke should be connected and are then only
&gt; powered when the key is 
&gt; turned to the ignition or run positions.

Turns out the ignition switch was wired backwards. #30
was in #15, and #15 was in #30. Thanks!
