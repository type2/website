Wondering what happened to fund? Hearing rumors she found a split camper and
having trouble getting money donated to her. Seems money won't be paid if
she
gets a split? Is this correct? What happens to monies donated at BBB8 and by
other people ? Thought idea was to get her a bus and on the road again.  Can
Ronnie or Chris or someone in the know let us know? Thanks, Vwhoward
