A long time ago, my Bosch voltage regulator fritzed out, and out of
curiousity, I decided to open it up and see if I could fix it, before
spending the $22 for the new one. Well, there were some dirty contacts on
one of the relays, so I cleaned them up, and reassembled it, installed it.
It worked fine, fixed the problem. Soon after, being a spares type of guy,
I went out and bought the new one, just in case!

Well, this all happened in 1974. The spare that I bought, still sits in
its box, onboard in the spares cabinet - donno if it even works yet!
