Most likely this guy is talking about &quot;hammer welding&quot;.  It is a process of
straightening sheet metal with out using filler. Someone who is 'really&quot; good
can get away with almost no filler at all.  It involves heating the metal up
and hammering it in conjunction with a back up dolly.
Consult your advanced body working manual for details.

&gt; that puzzled me, though. he said that this guy doesn't weld, he presses. i
&gt; guess i don't know what pressing is. my friend said that it was better than
&gt; welding
