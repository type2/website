Subject: Hello from Quebec!


&gt; Hello Todd! I'm looking for a split single or double cab! They're
&gt; starting a movie in Montreal next month taking place in 1967. The movie
&gt; 's gonna feature George Clooney and Julia Roberts. They need, as i said
&gt; a sc or dc pick-up from 67 or earlier. Do you know someone in Ontario or
&gt; even in the northeastern states that could be interrested? Of course
&gt; they probably pay good money. Anyway if you know someone, can you send
&gt; me a mail? Actually i'd like to hear from you, even if nobody come to
&gt; your mind.  They gonna need the pick-up for two or three days in
&gt; February.
&gt;
&gt; Yann
