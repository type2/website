Subject: Re: VW Boat

Someone asked about the worth of these boats, didn't
they??  I can honestly say that in about 8 years of
bussing and shopping for bus parts, I have never seen
one of these for sale. Anybody else? It's hard to say
what something is worth when there is nothing similiar
for sale to compare it to.
So my un-educated guess about how much these are worth
is: &quot;a mint&quot;!

Peace, John Baker
