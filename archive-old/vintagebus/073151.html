Subject: Fan and alternator problems

Hello,
My 65 double cab currently has a 1974 Beetle engine in
it (available and cheap when I needed a different
engine, and I bought the vehicle already converted to
12 volts).
Everything was running fine until I started getting
some odd scraping noises that sounded like the fan
rubbing, and when I felt inside the fan housing it
didn't feel too good.  Took the engine out (usually an
hour job by myself, but I forgot that the 74 Beetle
engine has a nut in the upper left bolt position
holding the engine to the transmission, and it was a
real bugger to get out--I don't know how I managed to
get that bolt tight when I installed the engine!), and
discovered that the fan had torn loose from the hub,
which was still tightly fastened under the nut on the
alternator shaft.  Well, before we were done we found
damage to the alternator, and the fan had done some
damage to the backing plate or whatever you call the
removable pieces in the fan housing between the
alternator and the fan.  

So--my question is, can I use the fan and backing
plate from spare generator equipped engines that I
have around, or must these parts be from an alternator
equipped engine?  I realize that the
alternator/generator tower would have to be changed,
but would anything else?
Does anyone have fans and the parts I need for sale? 
I looked for an hour or two at a number of on-line
catalogs and parts listings with no luck, except for
finding alternators and the fan hub and nut, but no
fan,  including Bus Depot, AirCooled_dot_net, and Old
Volks home, among others.  If they have the parts
listed, they fooled me, and need to make their web
catalogs easier to use.

Thanks for any help or advice that anyone can offer.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI
