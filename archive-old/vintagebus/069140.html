Hi Kevin,
We have been using the tar paper used on house roofs so far.  We even have 
used this folded tar paper under the battery box to simulate the VW tar paper 
strips used thier.  This helps ventilate under his area to dry out any water 
that would otherwise just sit trapped under there for weeks at a time here in 
the PNW.
  The sound dampening tar felt stuff used from the VW factory on the panels 
over the engine compartment would probably work the same.  The main thing is 
that it does not hold water like a sponge and the tar in this material does 
help repel rust.  We additionally tar all contact areas under the gas tank 
with roofing tar.  Plus after derusting, welding, zinc primering, and 
painting, we completely paint the battery area with roofing tar to not only 
prevent rust, but to repel the sulfuric acid of the battery that even greatly 
lessened with the use of a battery box does happen to get on the nearby sheet 
metal due to condensation of the fumes from the battery.
