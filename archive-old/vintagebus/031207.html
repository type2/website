Doc:
Actual 71's had a different bolt arrangement for the engine/trans bolt on the
top left.
(It's been years.) If I remember correctly, they used a tee-nut threaded insert
in the transmission, so you didn't have to hold the nut behind the doghouse
cooler. Damn near impossible. If someone knows what the specs are for this
part, it should be pretty easy to do.
OTOH, Do you still have the 71? You realize the pressure plate/ TO bearing/
bellhousing is different between the two, right? Maybe just put the 71 trans
into the 69 OR just change the bellhousings along with the engine.

69 double cab (doghouse cooler, 3 bolts ?)

&gt; My plan is to pull the engine from the 71 and stick in the 69.
&gt;
&gt; I am half way there. The 69 is engineless. :-(
&gt;
&gt; Anyway I need some input on the doghouse setup. When I get the engine out I
&gt; suspect the cooling tin will be in disarray as it was running somewhat hot
&gt; when last run. I understand I need some sort of foam gasket around the side
&gt; on the oil cooler which I suspect is gone. We will see. I also bought a
&gt; Hoover bit that I had rewelded  is there anything else needed there?
