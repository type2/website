&gt; 
&gt; I would hazard a guess that the KMLs are of US origin, since import laws require the object or the packaging of each individual objects to be labeled with the country of origin. I'm not sure, but I think this holds true of goods imported under NAFTA as well.
------------------------------

I think I recognize that brand. I think that's the brand I put in my
bus over four years ago and they're Korean. Even if it isn't the same
brand, I'm sure the bearings I used were from Korea and they cost
about $8.00 each (not the N207 roller, it was more like $20.00). I put
Czeckoslovakian (sp?) bearings in my truck a couple of years ago and
they were about half the price of the big name brands too. They're
also still doing just fine. I've hauled a ton of gravel in my truck a
couple of times (very scary). I think the most important thing in a
reduction box rebuild is to make sure everything is clean and no
damage is done while installing the bearings. One chip can ruin even
the most expensive bearing. Be sure to clean out the threads in the
end of the axle, chips like to hide in there.
