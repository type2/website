Subject: 1988 Porsche steerng wheel fit 1976 bus

For you vintagebus folks who don't want to read about a 1971 bus, kindly 
delete this.

But for those interested in a stroke of luck, the 1988 Porsche steering wheel 
fits a 1976 bus perfectly. Actually, we had a 1976 plus a 1973 bus lined up 
for dismantling.
We stripped the two front doors, two front seats (mine had wire showing and 
would tear a man's pants), two sets of door paneling, a dashboard with 
speedometer, an 
under dash A/C unit, and a 1976 steering column. From the 1973, we salvaged 
an A/C compressor. 

We tried the Porsche steering wheel, and it fit the 1976 steering column. 
Just the right thing, because I didn't want to cut the steering splines off a 
1974 and weld them
on the 1971.

Scott also got a steering wheel off the 1973 bus. It fit perfectly on his 
1974 Super Beetle. But I warned him beforehand that if I paid for this stuff, 
it was all mine. Out of the bigness of my heart, I let him keep the steering 
wheel. 

Total cost to me was $150.
