Yeah, I bitched at them a while back.  Assuming that did anything (probably
not), you can blame me for your increased registration fees...  ;)

 &gt;   Just got back from MVD to register my 15 window and got the shock of
my
 &gt;life. N.A.D.A. recognizes the real value of our buses now. For those that
 &gt;don't know N.A.D.A. is like kelley blue book and is what insurance
 &gt;companies, dealers set the selling and insured values of our buses at.
 &gt;According to NADA my 15 window is worth 6100 low and 14100 finished, my
DC
 &gt;4525 low and 11950 high, my DD panel 4300 low and 11150 high and my westy
 &gt;5920 low and 14550 high. So it appears that the Westy camper is the most
 &gt;valuable of all model buses. All these prices are for 1960 buses and the
 &gt;book goes back to 1956. They value a 1956 Deluxe at 16400.  All these
prices
 &gt;come from a survey of what has sold, insurance companies , etc.
