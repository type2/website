&gt; Well, it does have that desirable(?) characteristic, as well.
&gt; However, as a brewer, I feel fairly confident in saying that that's
&gt; not the primary purpose; the savings from not having to rinse the
&gt; sterilant out in a continuous-process production facility is pretty
&gt; significant.  The flavouring is just one of those serendipity
&gt; things....

Well, I note that it isn't present in lemon-lime drinks, but I'm no
beverage chemist...

&gt; 
&gt; Different acid (and we'll ignore the normal flow of material
&gt; undergoing digestion) - hydrochloric vs phosphoric.  The latter is
&gt; less aggressive in similar concentrations.  If I had to deal with
&gt; getting splashed with either, and had a choice which one, I'd
&gt; definitely pick the phosphoric, even at higher concentrations.

I'm pretty good with acids, seeing as how I was hooked with the
responsibility of designing our school's hazardous material storage.
Acids all go in one, bases go in the other, except for nitric acid which
gets it own cabinet all to itself (nasty stuff that, particularly if
mixed with other acids).  Flammables get their own cabinet.  Oddly, the
&quot;state of the art&quot; cabinets are of all-wood construction with a few
plastic bits, since acids don't attack wood as much as they do metal.

&gt; 
&gt; Definitely.  Note that it does *not* form an impermeable seal.  If you
&gt; just leave it on, the existing rust will get converted, and then
&gt; what's underneath will starting rusting/flaking as oxygen slowly flows
&gt; through the jelly.  Quite annoying, actually, if you get called away
&gt; after putting it on, and are significantly delayed in getting back to
&gt; it (like, say, overnight).
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the &quot;rinse, dry&quot; part of the above may also include &quot;wire
&gt; brush&quot; and &quot;repeat&quot;, depending on how bad your rust problem is.

That's for sure!

I'm looking at fixing my battery tray, which is perforated below the
battery but sound all around the edges where it meets the body.  My main
concern is to kill all the cancer, not get a perfectly factory repair.
The battery is going into a plastic battery box to lessen future
corrosion.
