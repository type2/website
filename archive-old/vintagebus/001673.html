-----Thom asked
WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND A
THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT THE
BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.

So that's

(200 x 2) + (200 x 2) + 500 = 1300 for some parts?  I betcha Kelly could
fabricate the pieces for less than that.  Granted it's not og, but that's an
awful lot for what?  Barndoor parts?  Are we gonna seen the '54 RHD Deluxe
driving around the streets of Sacramento in about a week?
