It's not going to be easy to say the least. They used a tee fitting off of
the carb for the fuel supply and manifold vacuum to carry away the exhaust.
They would tend to make an aircooled engine run a tad hot I would say. I
have one myself, you can get the install kits on eBay, but not for a
splitty. They were intended for front engined V8's. The length of runs is
going to present a problem, and they only work with manifold vacuum so they
only work with the engine running. Good luck.

&gt; I bought a Stewart Warner South Wind heater with no model # but i was told
&gt; it was the kind that got mounted under the dash of cars in the 1940s.  It
&gt; sorta looks like the top of an old boat motor case and is painted with
&gt; hamermill gray paint any one know about mounting one of these in a
splitty?
