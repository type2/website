&gt;so i finally bolt on these 1.4 rockers and when i check as i tighten there
&gt;is zero clearances anywhere! i backed the adjusters off all the way and
&gt;still nutin. are my pushers too long? can i just shim under the rockers? i
&gt;may as well go back to stock as the bus runs great, just always wanted to
&gt;try these out.

I have had the same problem with my 1.25:1 ratio rockers.  I try to shim
them up, use different adjusters,and I can't ever get them work.  I think
one has to end up cutting pushrods and so forth which I'm not ready to dive
into yet.
