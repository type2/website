Subject: Auto-craft ratio rockers

Hello all

Well, I am about to pull the engine and while it is out, I was thinking of
what I might do to take advantage of the situation.  I received a pair of
auto-craft ratio rockers, with push rods, from the fellow I bought the bus
from.  The engine is a 1600DP with dual solex pict 34 carbs, about 4500 miles
on the engine.

My questions are:

#1- should I change over to the autocraft rockers, or leave it alone.  What
advantages/disadvantages will I see???

#2 Do I need to do anything special to put the rockers on, or can I just pull
the old ones, swap the push rods and install the autocraft, and reset the
valves.

Thanks again for all the advice, it is much appreciated.
