&lt;&lt; Hi, speaking of interior panels,  does any know where to get front door
 panels with the opening (or pocket) in them? Either the grey kombi style
 or the colored vinyl standard bus style?  Thanks.  Chris  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
You can buy the gray panels from Wolfburg West and then cut out the pocket 
opening and either make your own pockets to rivet in place or canabalize a 
set of pockets out of a set of beat up original panels.   Eric&amp;Barb
