Subject: 61 bus progress

hi all,

Just got done working on my 61 for the weekend and thought i'd post a
progress report... After this i'm heading out to the local bus club
meeting (Missouri Micros in Saint Louis, MO.  If anyone is interested in
hearing more drop me a line p-mail.)

I got the front beam back in, woohoo... did it all by myself without too
much hassle.  The only reason i could do that is because i had removed the
drums and backing plates, this makes it much easier, you just have to be
careful of the threads on the spindles. (if you are a big klutz wrap em in
duct tape for a bit, hehe)

The 67 beam fit perfectly, i anti-siezed the bolts and torqued em up.  I
love anti sieze... apply it like holy water to any under car part and
you'll never have to deal with a stuck fastener :)  As an interesting
note, the steering dampner on the 61 beam bolted to the beam and to the
body.  On the 67 beam it bolts to a boss on the lower beam tube, better
design i'd say.

My girlfriend worked on wire wheeling some rust to get it ready for the
POR-15 treatment. She tried to remove that headliner glue but we couldnt
find any of my solvents that would remove it.... we tried goof-off,
lacquer thinner and even charcoal lighter fluid!!! (we didnt light it
though, heh) There has to be something that will dissolve that glue and
not the paint... i'll try acetone next... that eats paint a bit, but maybe
it eats glue more ;)

I got the rear brake cylinders in, and the hoses... i put the new urethane
swingaxle boots on (black) greased the parking brake cables, and did some
other futzing around.

My throwout arm is in there with some funky wrong size washers, i might
just buy a whole welded bugpack unit and replace the whole shebang, been
hearing lots of reports of these thinjs breaking... and mine doesnt line
up quite right anyway...

I was going to replace all the transmission mounts, but it was a bigger
job than i thought.  I will do that this upcoming winter or when they go,
whichever comes first.

Now on to finishing the brakes and then working out electrics, random
interior stuff, and the engine...

take care,

Steve
