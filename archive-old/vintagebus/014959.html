[...]
&gt;I having problems figuring out my numbers on my bus.
&gt;this is from the tag behind the pass. front seat:
&gt;166
&gt;430 042 025 108
&gt;TE 2312 523642 6171849

&gt;I do not understand the paint
&gt;numbers and model code.

I don't have an answer to the paint question, but my paint code is very 
similar: 523622.  my bus is a 1964 westfalia SO-35.  I am beginning to think 
that the 52 and 36 codes might be specific to westfalias.  i did find a 
paint code for L36 on the karmann ghia page, it codes for azure blue, but it 
was a color only available for type I's in the early fifties, so I assume 
the 36 means something else. I have removed some of the paint on my bus down 
to the metal, and it appears to me that my original color was pastel green. 
Hints anybody?

Thanks!

Mike Anderson
'64 rolling shell SO-35
