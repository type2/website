Subject: Re: [VB] What is sealing wax red?

&gt;
&gt;The more mature side of me wishes to encourage folks to go do a web-search
&gt;or even go to an old-school analog library and research color theory.

Along these lines, http://manual.gimp_dot_org/manual/GUM/Part_four.html and
especially http://manual.gimp_dot_org/manual/GUM/Prepress.html deal with
a subset of this: how to get an image that looks good on your computer
monitor to come out of a printing press looking approximately the same
way.  The basic thing I get out of all of this is &quot;it ain't easy&quot;.

TV manufacturers faced similar problems when color TVs first came out.
Put a color TV in a room and ask each of ten people to adjust every
knob until it &quot;looks right&quot; and you will end up with 11+ different
sets of settings.  They tried all kinds of tricks but even the TV
you bought yesterday still has &quot;color&quot; and &quot;tint&quot; controls.
 
&gt;How many young folks have even SEEN sealing wax and know what it
&gt;was used for?

Yes to both.

&gt;On this list I am amazed that no one has started calling the chit
&gt;&quot;Ceiling Wax&quot; red.

This was originally what I thought it was, by analogy with &quot;floor
wax&quot; and the Puff the Magic Dragon song.

Also in the direction of Bus painting, see pages 15-16 of &quot;VW Bus&quot;
by Keith Seume.  The OG paint process was approximately: acid dip
(cleaning), phosphate dip (anti-rust), hand rub the entire body,
spray primer, spray the first color, and (if two colors) mask off
the bottom and respray.  (The top first/bottom first/dash same color
as top or bottom is a whole other thread).
