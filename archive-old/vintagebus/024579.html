    I just got off the phone with the import FLAPS I deal with and he
quoted me $19 and change for the 311-501-283 in FAG, and said he can get
the other #'s next day for under $30 ea also in FAG...

    This is my jobber discounted price... says list is about $30 for the
311 and about $45 for the other two

    Has one of the 311 bearings in stock can get however many I want by
Monday (he said overnight, but he is a bit optimistic sometimes  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)

        Take care...

                JonR


    May even get a better deal if I buy a quantity....

    and no I don't want to go into competition with any other List
vendor!!  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
