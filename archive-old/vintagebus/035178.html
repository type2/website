Good people of the list:

Trying to figure out if the white steering wheel is correct for my 65
Westfalia based on a Kombi.  The wheel, shifter and knob, and parking
brake handle and button were all ivory when I got the bus (very sad
shape at the time).  The bus is pearl white (L87).  I've seen L87 kombis
with black wheels and horn buttons, but they were not campers...at least
not Westfalias.

What would have been the correct wheel color and what type of horn
button would have come on it?  I've seen three different horn buttons.
Wolfsburg crest, plain ivory with black center, and all black.

Thanks for the anal retentive trivia folks.

commercial vehicles came with black steering wheels and knobs.   Passenger
type 2s came with white ones.     except for 67 knobs, which are black and
their own style.

Now, westys are made on type 23s- kombis, but they get white wheels and knobs
(except the 67  knobs)  Just like they get painted inside in the back, which
regular kombis don't.

Buses with black steering wheels get black horn rings

buses with white steeing wheels get white horn rings

deluxes get wolfsberg crest center section, all other get black centers.

okay- white is not right- it is either grey (63? through 66) or ivory (before
that)

this does not apply to barndoors.
