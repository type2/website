Subject: [VB] '67 trans into a '66
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9912031129370.5566-100000_at_cks.ssd.k12.wa_dot_us&gt;

The '67 R&amp;P is known to give a better top end speed than the earlier R&amp;P's
as I understand it.
I have a '67 Bus trans and am thinking about putting it into the '66 after
removing the tranny from it.
I'm thinking that maybe just swapping one entire system with another will
be much easier. 
Also, I like the idea of having a good basis started for a 12 Volt
conversion.  The motor I have set aside for this Bus is a 1600 single
port.
The only difficulty I foresee is in finding a 12V fuel gauge.  
If there are owners of one of those critters out there and they wish to
separate it from their stash for monetary compensation......e-mail me with
the details.  I also have stuff to horsetrade if that works better.
Thanks and later
