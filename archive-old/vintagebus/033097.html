&lt;&lt; uestion; When did VW change from the thick to the thin cargo door latch
 rods? I am not talking about the early ones with the notch, but the later
 ones with the screw that holds them to the latch. When going through a pile
 of them I have, I noticed 2 different thicknesses of these rods and have
 never noticed this before! Parts book demons&gt;start your fingers walking.

these rods are good for pick ups sticks.  WHen taking the mechanism out, wire 
the rods in place so they dont fall out or you can have fun reinstalling 
them.    do your rods have part numbers, ronnie?  You have parts lists- tell 
us what you find.
