Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor :(


For what it is worth my son used the Corroless on his panels floor and so 
far so good.  It also does not require the top coating to protect it from UV 
etc. like the POR15 does as I understand it.

&gt; &gt; I have heard diff things about POR 15, some people say you have to get 
&gt;all
&gt; &gt; the rust off before you use it or it'll just rust away under the POR 15,
&gt; &gt; others say you can just cover it up.  What should I believe?
&gt;
&gt;Hi Clara,
&gt;I've worried about the same thing. Especially since Ronnie's solid POR
&gt;floor Porsche 356 story.
&gt;For solid places that won't flex it sounds like Corroless may do well.
&gt;It makes sort of a glass crystalline structure as I recall. On parts that
&gt;are thin sheet metal that are subject to flexing it may not be good.
&gt;I have used POR on beams, axles, and windshields under the gaskets.
&gt;Haven't seen any rust yet.
&gt;Either product is pretty thick stuff I think. I'm leaning towards
&gt;Corroless for my front floors and drip rails.  Any users of both have
&gt;opinions?
