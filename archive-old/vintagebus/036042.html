&lt;&lt; What part of the switch are you calling the &quot;upside of the switch body&quot;?  
Do you mean the switch lever itself?&gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
Up as in upside of the panel as installed in the bus.
 
&lt;&lt;If so, then I hold the retaining ring and turn the switch 
counter-clockwise? or clockwise?&gt;&gt;
Okay, lets try this.  Place your left hand on the switch body and your right 
on the collar.  Then try to either turn the switch body away from you while 
holding the collar still.  Or if that does not move that way at first, try 
turning both the switch and collar an equal amount toward you (Clockwise 
viewing the switch body.).  If that then works then turn just the switch body 
away from you (Counter clockwise.)
 
&lt;&lt;The last thing I want to do is break this switch, it's the only one I 
have!!! &gt;&gt;
Know what you mean.  Also when storing ambulance fan assemblies out of a bus 
make sure never to lay the fan assembly on the switch knob.  This causes way 
too many broken knobs!    Eric&amp;Barb
