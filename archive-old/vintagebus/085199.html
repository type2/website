Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for a piece of glass

&gt; Make sure to ask for glass measurement, and compare it to the hole  in the
&gt; hatch you have!  Between 1955 &amp; early 64 there were two  sizes.
&gt;
Do you mean Deluxe and non-Deluxe or Bus and Truck or something else?

Just curious as I have various non-Deluxe 57-63 rear hatches and windows and 
all have the same size glass as far as I can tell.  I have swapped the glass 
around in several of them without problems.
