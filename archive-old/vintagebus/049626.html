Subject: Re: [VB] RPM/Speed/gears

&gt;I finally installed the tach in my bus, VDO Street Eliminator, to see how my
&gt;driving habits were and to see what RPM's I usually run/drive at. The
&gt;results were a lot different then I expected. So here we go.
&gt;
&gt;Using my regular driving habit I found that I run the engine up to 4900 rpm
&gt;in first and second, 4500 rpm in 3rd and when going to 4th it drops to 2500
&gt;or less. How can this be?


Do you have a ton of other gizmos in the bus? Like a slammin' stereo, or
lots of gauges, or extra lights?
I've found that any or all of the above can drastically change tach
readings, fwiw.

if you mean that the numbers seem correct, but WHY? I dunno :)
