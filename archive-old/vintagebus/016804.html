The engine compartment has to endure a lot more heat than the rest
of the bus, and nasty grease, oils, gasoline, battery vapors, and the 
occasional engine cleaner.  Plus they didn't give the engine compartment
the same paint-love as they did the rest of the car.

Your engine compartment should be the same color as the bus around it.

I've heard even the &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; cleaners will harm the
paint if left on too long.  My favorite is Castrol Super Clean, and
it takes paint off, too..
