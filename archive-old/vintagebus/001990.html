I changed the oil in my 65 Splittie (once again, first time) and bought a
new oil screen with gaskets.  When I put the new gaskets and oil screen in
and tightened it down, and added the oil, it started leaking around the
seal..... Question: Are you suppose to get the the cardboard gasket wet
first ?  Put gasket sealant on it ?  Use a different type of gasket other
than cardboard ? I'm a idiot and I dont know what I'm doing ?  Don't answer
that !  Also what kind of oil do you guy's use in a 1600CC engine that has
about 4000 miles on it ?  My friend, who is more technically inclined than
me recommended Castrol GTX 10W/30, but he doesnt know anything about VW's.
