Subject: Worth the wait-Tom Conner Roof Racks

I ordered one of these back in March, and picked it up off the truck
last night. The rack's 'shiny primer grey' (Tom's description) powder
coat was really nice, almost the color of headlight buckets, but
slightly darker. Welding was very nice, and for it's size, it was light,
at about 50+ lbs.
I must say I wish I brought a truck to pick it up, and not the bus,
because finding the 'right' spot with a eight foot+ rack and a 5.6'
woman with you wasn't fun. The rack liked one specific spot to mount
nicely, or the clamps wanted to x thread. In the parking lot of the
shipping co, we only got three clamps on, because I didn't have the rack
far enough forward to be happy. Drove like it wasn't there (at least
empty :) ).

After repaint, I am going to plasti-dip the legs where they contact the
rails, and the clamps too. Judicious use of heavy felt and careful
ploppling with a jeep top winch form the garage rafters should do it,
but for now, she's up there with expected scratches.

My initial opinion is that the clamps might be designed with slighly
more forgiveness/play to prevent x threading, but I think my issues were
related to the size of the rack and it's 'sweet' spot on the roof. Also,
plasti dip to begin with might be nice. I wish I had inquired also about
the width of the ladder, because I would have requested a wider one, to
place both feet one one rung. The ladder is about 14&quot; wide, if that..

I highly recommend Tom's work, it is neat, clean, and finished well, and
well worth the wait.
