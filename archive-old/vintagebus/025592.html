It's probably kinda late, but what about a roof mounted radiator?  Be much
shorter plumbing runs and you could enclose it on a shroud like the &lt;GASP&gt; scoops
us non fashion conscious like to plaster in strategic places on our busses so we
don't have to go to all those boring shows ;-)  The only down side I can see is
climbing up to check coolant level.  As far as &quot;but there'd be pressure when it's
not running&quot;, isn't a radiator/cooling system SUPPOSED to be pressurized?
