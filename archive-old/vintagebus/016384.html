Hehe...and don't forget that Volkswagen OWNS Rolls Royce!

Ben, if I were you, I would have talked to that guy's manager too. 
Whatta jerk he was. We have a pretty good relationship with the 
dealers in our area, but they really don't understand the whole 
vintage thing either. Every year we have the Bob Baker Vintage VW 
Spring Festival and the dealer (Bob Baker) clears out their lot and 
showroom to let us fill it up. It was pretty cool walking into the 
showroom this year and almost tripping over a 1950 Hebmuller!

Three years ago I had the 55 Westy in the showroom and one of the 
sales drones asked me &quot;What is THAT?&quot; jeez...I said &quot;it's kinda like 
a Eurovan, only a lot cooler...and a LOT cheaper.&quot;

Have a good weekend all!
