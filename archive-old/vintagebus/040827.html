Please, someone send me to go check this one out
in the 530 area code.  It's been for sale for a 
week up here, guess he didn't sell it thru the local
paper, so trying the 'big city' one.  I've been itching
to go check it out, but I know if I see it I may buy
it, and that would cause some friction at home, but
if I look at it for someone else, I can get away with
that.  No more info was provided in local ad either.
It's actually located in Grass Valley, 30 mi east of
Sacratomato.
