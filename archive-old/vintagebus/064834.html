&gt; The front of the tranny does not have a bushing to keep the input shaft

&gt; small stud. The exterior input shaft is screwed onto the interior input
&gt; shaft and then the splined reverse gear is slid over that mating
&gt; section. The c-clip is the applied to hold the splined reverse gear in
&gt; place.

This causes me to wonder about the cause of that little stud breaking,
which allows the input shaft to come out of the transmission.  If the
input shaft is tightened on the stud before the splines are connected
with the reverse gear then the stud is placed under great stress by
sideways force on the input shaft.  this sideways force could be
inadvertantly applied when dropping the engine, moving the transmission,
etc.

It might be better to leave the input shaft slightly (say, a couple of
splines) loose on the stud when assembling the transmission to prevent the
breaking of the stud.
