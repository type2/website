    Well after all the stuff that has happened to me this week I am leaving
on a short vacation. This is a family thing with young kids , you know Lego
Land, The Zoo, Del Mar fair and finally Mexico. All this in 4 days, we'll be
whopped , but I promised the kids this trip. 
   So Old Volks of Az/type2parts_dot_com will be closed till Thursday of next
week. Any orders that come in or were promised shipped will go out then, as
will all the EMPI BUSES (I think I'm sold out 150 of them) and EMPI is now
out of them I was told. If you were on my list and haven't replied I will
get back to all on Thursday and let the lists know what I may have left.
Next years EMPI bus is supposed to be the one with SURFBOARDS, we'll have to
wait and see.

  I also just got in seat clamp kits, radio block off plates, front emblems,
and early door latch wedges (on the body) and full sheets of masonite
textured panels and another load of Safari's and other CE stuff is leaving
England and will be here shortly.

thanks   Ronnie    old volks of az
