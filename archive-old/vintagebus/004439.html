 I do them for fun. I would love to do them professionally, but alas, very
 little jobs like that where I live. Also with a little more time, I could
 have made 'em look even better, I did those in about an hour or so.

 Also, I'm in the process of making some Type 2 Mouse pads. What would
 everyone buy if I did a Type 2 Mouse Pad? Just curious to hear what
everyone
 is looking for.

 Thanks for the compliments

&gt; &gt; Very nice work... you do the graphics for fun or professionally ?  Oh
&gt; &gt; yeah... they are much better that way and I do like the lowered look.
