Well, I'm looking at some of the 'new' Mexican engines, GEX seems decent:
Hyd lifters,unleaded heads,etc with 12/12 warranty for 1,199. Mofoco has
'new' Mexican 1600DP for 1,350. Strictly Foreign has a new 1600DP for 1,259
with a 24/24 warranty and no core charge . These all sound pretty good,
warranty on the SF engine looks tempting. Seems like it would be wiser  to
go for the new engine since the prices aren't all that far apart. So... any
suggestions?

TIA
