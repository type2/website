Subject: Jenny

Well, this sure seems appropriate for a Friday. Perhaps Friday the 13th 
aint so unlucky after all. Today, Jenny ran for the first time since I 
got her nearly a year ago. I tried and tried to get her fired up to no 
avail, so I had her flatbedded down the street to Fred the Motor head and 
he had her running by noon ( he didn't even start on her until at least 
9am!). He said someone had put a Ford solenoid on her and she was 
miswired. He also said she runs beautiful, though she needs a muffler and 
a battery. God, I love this guy!!! He got my baby running :) :) :0
