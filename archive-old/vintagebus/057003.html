Subject: Re: [VB] Dear John letter...

People *should* be blowing off the MVVC show, or at the very least,
passing out informational literature so the unwitting dupes that
show up can realize they're being tooled.  Yes, tooled.  They're
letting themselves be prostitued by VWOA, in exchange for a place
to hold their show.  They're being *used* to pimp the new water-pumper
crap.   *They* think they're in some sort of symbiotic relationship.
They're not.  The 'benevolent' entity that's using them as a sales
tool is at the same time making it hard for those same people to get
parts.

Sure, its hard work putting on a show, which just makes it that much sadder.

The best thing for this club to do would be to *move* the show somewhere
else, and explicitly *UN-invite* VWOA.  Second best would be to pass
out flyers explaining what's going down, because the average VW guy
on the street is completely unaware.  John Henry has some excellent
material they could use.

&gt; Dear John, as well as other Midwest VW enthusiasts,
&gt;=20
&gt; I'll try to be diplomatic as possible, so here goes.  =20
&gt;=20
&gt; It seems to me that you aren't being fair at all to the Michigan Vintage =
Volkswagen Club, who is the actual entity that is holding and hosting the &quot;=
MVVC Festival&quot;.  Have you ever even been to this event?  Lots of Type 2's r=
egularly attend this May even=
t, and in general, seem to keep coming back for more.  In your eagerness to=
 jump all over VWoA's sh#t, while simultaneously promoting your own event d=
uring the same weekend, you're actually undermining the gracious efforts of=
 a lot of hard working Vintag=
e VW enthusiast who put on this event.  I personally don't care how you fee=
l about the crap VWoA is pulling with their trademark crap.  But you, as we=
ll as others,  need to be clear about the fact that VWoA doesn't run or hol=
d this quality event, as you=20=
initially alluded to in your post.  Basically, the only connection that VWo=
A has with the event is that they allow the MVVC to use VWoA's parking lot =
for the Sunday event, they understandably put their current line of cars an=
d regalia on display in a boo=
th in the parking lot, and in recent years they have opened up their privat=
e collection of Vintage VW's for the participants to view.  So before you g=
et your own, or anyone else's shorts all bunched up, please get your facts =
straight and please stop inco=
rrectly bad-mouthing the efforts of some rather nice VW enthusiast who for =
quite a long time now have run a great event.  It's okay to focus your unha=
ppiness at VWoA.  I'm just taking issue with your mis-information and your =
self promotion of your event=20=
at the expense of other good VW enthusiasts.
&gt;=20
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'm not a MVVC member, but I've attended many of thei=
r May events.  And I'm definitely not a VWoA cheerleader, and I'm not happy=
 either about how they are handling themselves while trying to protect thei=
r trademarks.  But I believe=20=
in being fair, and in your post, you weren't.  I wish you guys luck with yo=
ur event, and I hope to be able to attend someday, meet you all personally,=
 and chew the fat around the fire.  But if you guys continue to hold it on =
the same weekend as such a ni=
ce event as the MVVC Festival, many of us will be choosing the &quot;MVVC Festiv=
al&quot;.  =20
&gt;=20
&gt; Best of luck for your event!
&gt;=20
&gt; Bill Bowman
&gt; NEATO &amp; LiMBO, VVWCA and the DKF!
