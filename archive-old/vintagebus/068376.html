Subject: Light Buckets?

Up to what year had the oval shaped Headlight bucket?  My 66 has a Bullet turn
signal nose.  I bought a used set of the kick panels, part of a deal, from a
67 Bus.  The things won't work, mainly because of the headlight buckets.

Anyone willing to trace out the oval hole for me so I can make a custom set of
Kick-Panels?

Dave
