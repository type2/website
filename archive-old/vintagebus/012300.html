&gt;  What year did the engine cases start showing up with case savers??
&gt;  I'm considering building a 2010 motor for the Bus and want to keep an eye
&gt;  out for a case that already has them inserted.
&gt;  I had thought about using a 1500 case but will hold out for a case with
&gt;  the savers.  Any info is appreciated.
&gt;  Thanks 

In the book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot;, Tom 
Wilson says on page 9 that case savers were installed in '71 and up 
Type 1-3 engines.  Later on pages 36-37 he says the change was made 
in '73, and at the same time they went back to 8mm studs (from 10mm) 
and began deep-studding the #3 upper rear cylinder-head stud.  He 
says you'll find lots of case savers with 10mm studs but they weren't 
factory.
