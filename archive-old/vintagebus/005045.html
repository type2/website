What hubcaps?  I thought it might be from the front, I honestly just got
lazy and/or was in a hurry when checking for the holes in the backing
plates. Thankyou to all who replied to me the brake info. Got them adjusted
up decent in about 20 minutes, a flashlight would have made it less. It
seems the fronts were out much more than the rears and all is well now. The
next step is to bleed the brakes to flush out old fluid and any water
accumulation. Then maybe get the front drums turned and look at the shoes,
though the shoes are probably fine as are not old.

About tierod ends, I could replace all of them(5or 6 right?), but it seems
the inners are worse, though when you replace them as they are worse than
the outers and move first, now the outers would move just as much quite
possibly. Either way, any advice about getting the cheapest tierod/ends I
can or getting German tierod/ends?

I am sure I need a seperator tool. Will anyone from discount auto do? Or
should I get one through a VW parts/tool place? Are they usually the wedge
type you pound? Or are they the puller type with a threaded center that
pushes them out as you turn the center bolt thing?
I also have a little pnuematic impact hammer with some flat bits that would
act as a wedge. Has anyone used one of these on tierod ends before?

Thanks again people, keep truckin.
