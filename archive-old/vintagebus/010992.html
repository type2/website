Steve,

If a dragging clutch could be your problem, off hand I can think of two 
problems that can cause a clutch to drag.  One is the pilot bearing in the 
gland nut.  I had one of these go out on me driving into a Bug-O-Rama in 
Phoenix a couple years ago, and I had to drive all the way back to 
Albuquerque with a clutch that didn't disengage.  Another problem we've been 
having here, that I haven't heard anyone else mention, is interference 
between the clutch disc hub, and the center hole in the pressure plate 
assembly.  My '59 Westy (which has a noisy transmission bearing when cold, 
hence the reason I've been dragging around a spare transmission) would make 
noise with the clutch pedal to the floor, but if I let up just a little, the 
clutch would completely release, and the noise would cease.

Kind of long winded response, but could either of these be your problem?

JP
