Subject: [Fwd: Camper 67 parts]

This showed up in my mailbox and I'm sure that one (or many) of our fine
listmembers can help out.  Please respond to the sender, not me.  I'm
about as far as one can get from Puerto Rico.

Hi there:

I found about you surfing the net, and it seems that maybe you can help me
out or at least know someone who can.  I own a 1967 camper, and my wooden
interiors including ice-box and seat behind the drivers seat were distroyed
during huricane Georges.  They were inside my tools house and everything is
ruined.  Also my pop top assembly is broken.  The z-bed and seats are intact
since they are inside my sons, bedroom.  Do you know someone in the world who
sells this or shop drawings so a friend of mine makes them new?  Also I would
like to find an ice-box, no need to be new but in fair to good condition.

I think that my bus is the only camper here in Puerto Rico, and I am dying to
have all together once again.   I will REALLY APPRECIATE if anything can be
done.  By the way I loved all those photos that I found I saved them in my
computer for reference, specially Steves, this one looks almost like mine but
a my wooden looked a little darker.  If he has an e-mail address maybe he can
send me photos...

Again, thanks for your help in advance, your Westfalia 67 friend in Puerto
Rico,
