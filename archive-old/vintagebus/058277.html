Subject: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p



all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it 
politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following 
poll:

 

how many of you actually DRIVE your bus 
DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT a

honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)? 

 

no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot; 
excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.

no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my 
busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called making
the 
heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned
to go 
to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses
didn't 
rust out.

no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of 
miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.

 

i don't even own any other kind of car, so what 
else WOULD i drive?!

 

i'm just curious.
