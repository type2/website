&gt;HELP! I need the following for a 5/10/61 built hatchtop, flipseat
&gt;Westfalia, vin #  776553:
&gt;1) does anyone have a bus of any kind with a vin number within 250 either
&gt;way? I need to compare notes.

The Registry on VintageBus_dot_com has a &quot;chassis number proximity&quot; search.
It shows an ambulance built on 6 May (1501 older), a Kombi from 4 May
(2594 older), and a couple from later in May (4000+ newer).

If you can't find anybody with a Bus close to yours, one way to look
at it is that you can then do whatever you want and that will be
&quot;correct&quot;, as there's nothing to check against.  :)

Close changes from Doliwa include

15 June   794 677   Bimetal exhaust valves (engine 5 891 601)
11 April  761 997   Bent section of the instrument panel sheet metal
                    with larger radius.  Steering retaining plate
                    moved 7mm to the rear.  Cab rear wall: edging
                    for Kombi and Double-cab.  Driver's door: pocket
                    removed; holder for four-sided key at the edge
                    of the front wall.  Door lining material changed. 
28 April  768 939   Plastic grip on dashboard in series production.
 6 May    774 540   Speedometer with red line for 50 km/h (only on
                    km/h speedos)
