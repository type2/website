Subject: Converting from 9-Pin Box

I bought a '64 delivery van that has been upgraded with a
non-(dys)functional 9-pin box controlling the signals/flashers.  There don't
seem to be any replacements out there.  Does anyone have experience
replacing this system with a conventional flasher?

Appreciate any help.

&quot;One of the most fashionable notions of our times is that social problems
like poverty and oppression breed wars. Most wars, however, are started by
well-fed people with time on their hands to dream up half-baked ideologies
or grandiose ambitions, and to nurse real or imagined grievances.&quot;  --
