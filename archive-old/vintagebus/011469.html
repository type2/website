&gt; profit set aside for a set of Safari windows to go in my '58 Kombi. From

&gt; I'd love to get a set of originals, but it's hard enough to even find a
&gt; &quot;splittie&quot; at all in my neck of the woods. Any feedback will be appreciated.

Izzy's are the way to go.  There's a web site someowhere, and I think
another listmember has actually installed them.  The wolfgang ones are
the equivalent of road kill - it's what you have to eat when nothing else
is available.  Not any more!
