Subject: bus sighting

I was on the way home from the office and spotted a
split Kombi on the 3500 block of Lincoln Ave. in
Chicago.  It was blue/white with an orange &quot;34&quot; logo
where the big round VW should be(Payton's number?) and
I was wondering if it belonged to anyone on the list? 
 I rather felt sorry for him because it is way too hot
and miserable to drive any vehicle without AC today
(95 degrees, ouch!).
