Leave use not forget to add the plexiglass dome for that stratoliner look... 
or perhaps something more for the interstate?  A roof gun mount from a B25?

Well... its almost friday...

&gt;I'm converting it to a barndoor walk-thru double-door hardtop deluxe poptop 
&gt;Westy. Also have some nice flip seat Westy stuff that might
&gt;go in there and a Dormo top would finish it off nicely.
