 Hmm a while back I was shipping my dads  huge wooden Biplane propeller back
east... it was almost 8 feet and 100 pounds at least. UPS had no problem and
it was in a big long wooden crate(even longer). I shipped it right from the
UPS center in Phoenix. Why would gates be any different? Whats the official
size restriction?
Also shipped a 6 foot bumper via the US postal system. Im guessin thats
about the length of DC gates. Try them if UPS refuses.

&gt;I doubt they will fit with UPS's size restrictions.  I recently shipped a
set of single cab gates from CA to Oregon, and they were too big for
UPS.
