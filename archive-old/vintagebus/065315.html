Subject: Re: [VB] sandblaster recommendation

I have the $99 Harbor Fright [sic] unit, which sucked until I upgraded
it with professional-grade hose, fittings and nozzle from the local 
sandblasting supply house (Temple Associates) at a cost of ~$240.  An
equivalent-sized proper unit from them woulda run me $350, so I'm $10
ahead, right?

I use #80 Australian garnet, which works great.  I do my blasting in the
back yard, and don't bother recycling the media.  I think of it as improving
the drainage :)  And I can't believe we ship boat loads of ground up 
rock all the way up from Oz.

Here's a Tom's truck bed after a pass with #80 garnet.  A second pass will
remove the remaining paint and rust.
