I have a new job. to celebrate my last summer of freedom i'm gonna have
new surfboard shaped. to make sure this is bus related,-  i  need to know
what type of racks there are or hauling method recommendations. My kombi
is a 61 so i have a small back window are there rear mount safaris?that
way i could stick it in the back.
 I'm getting a fairly long board because i want to use it for fishing for
taco (octopus) as well as surfing. what are my measurement parameters?
rear window, rear cargo door width? roof length? etc.
 my bus is still on the mainland and  i'll pick it up when i finish
student teaching. therefor, i cant measure it. the $500+/ rack price
figures i've seen in this list are cost prohibitive. :-(
