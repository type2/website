&lt;&lt; when i signal my turn, they are sometimes stubborn and want to just 
flicker and then finally blink and then blink a few times and then flicker 
again. it's very irrational behavior in my opinion and there is no pattern in 
their actions. I am thinking it has
 something to do with the signal lever end since they both do it (it's a 
conspiracy). do I just need to scrape them off a little? maybe pour some coke 
on there to eat away the nasties? or is it something else? i'm not much of an 
electrician, although i'd like to understand it better, since this is my 
weakest point when it comes to mechanical knowledge. any guru help would be 
very much appreciated.
 
 also, how hard is it to get my hazards working? it's not a neccesity, but it 
would be a nice thing to have. it just bugs me that i don't know what's going 
on with all these wires. TIA. &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
First clean and silicon grease (Dielectric grease) all the connections in the 
wiring up front and carefully check to make sure all the wires are going to 
where they are supposed to.  Check all the relays to be 12 volt since your 66 
normally would have been 6 volt.  
  Next take your blinker switch apart from the steering column and remove 
it's cover.  Check for any wires breaking off or loose.  Spray the contact 
points with contact cleaner and work the lever back and forth.  Once dry 
Q-tip in a tad of silicon grease on the points.
  If this does not solve your problem you most likely need a new 66-67only 
nine prong blinker box or the conversion kit that uses two standard relays 
you can buy from any FLAPS.  You might be able to fix your old blinker box by 
taking off the plastic cover and soldering the brass rivets that go through 
and electrically connect the stack of many circuit boards to each other.  
These rivets loosen over time and allow corrosion to cause problems with the 
signals.
