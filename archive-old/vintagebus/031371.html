Subject: Peka tow hitch info needed!

I'm posting this for Matthew Henricks. He can't seem to get through to
the list. Please respond to him at mjhenks_at_yahoo_dot_com and the list as I
think he can still read the posts. 

------------------- 

Does anyone out there have a Peka Tow hitch for a splitty? I just got
one and need help reading some of the info on the ID plate. Also, does
anyone have any pictures of their's either installed or not? Mine is in
pieces and i am not sure how to put it back together. 

The info on the tag say's: 
Peka Anhangevorrichiung VW703 
Hersteller: Peka. Fahtzeugbau Karlstuhe 
Typ: M47 Prufz: ~~M3383 Bauj: 1966 


More stuff here i can not read but is related to tow 
wieght, etc. 

Can any one tell me what this means or if it matches 
there Peka hitch? 

Thanks 
MAtthew
