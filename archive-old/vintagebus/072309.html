&gt; I don't think I will be able to get any keys, so I am looking for how to 
&gt; hot wire the thing.

Hi Kevin,
Install new battery and check for working electrical system.  Run a wire from 
the left taillight running circuit to the positive side of the coil.  To 
start the bus turn on the running lights, and slide under with it in nuetral and 
turn over the engine by shorting with a 13mm open wrench from the large 
positive cable on the soliniod to the small red wire.  Meanwhile have someone work 
the gas pedal.
