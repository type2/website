&gt;&gt; Subject: Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have struggled w/ overheating on my bus, and thought I
&gt;&gt; should post after reading recent posts on the subject.  I
&gt;&gt; don't claim to be an expert and only offer my experience
&gt;&gt; which is limited to 1600 upright motors.  I achieved
&gt;&gt; improvements, but am still working on the problem--so take
&gt;&gt; this FWIW.  My opinion is that every detail matters and must
&gt;&gt; be verified b/f you solve an overheating problem.  Vacuum
&gt;&gt; leaks.  Missing Hoover bit?  Correct carb w/ correct jets.
&gt;&gt; correct timing/distributor.  Correct fan speed.  correct or
&gt;&gt; at least reasonable compression ratio (some claim that too
&gt;&gt; low or too high can increase temps).  Plugged oil passages in
&gt;&gt; case? closed cell foam sealing the doghouse oil cooler?
&gt;&gt; Stock quality heater boxes &amp; muffler.  It goes on...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; From my experience, a few points worth emphasizing:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) replacement carbs are not jetted correctly (too lean)
&gt;&gt; for a bus.  Verify the jetting and try to match stock jets
&gt;&gt; (see specs in Bentley).  The air correction (AC) jet is very
&gt;&gt; important here--bigger AC jet means leaner mixture.  I am
&gt;&gt; still trying to find a stock AC jet for a 71 bus--which is
&gt;&gt; what you need for a 1600dp in a bay window.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) Fan speed:  hand turn your gen/alt pulley w/ a wrench
&gt;&gt; and count the number of revolutions to the gen/alt pulley for
&gt;&gt; one revolution of your crank shaft pulley.  Accd to
&gt;&gt; VeeWee111, the stock ratio is 1 turn of crank pulley to 2.0
&gt;&gt; turns of the gen/alt pulley on a 1600dp.  1:2.1 is better.
&gt;&gt; From memory, the correct ratio is 1:1.9 on a 1600sp.  Any
&gt;&gt; less and your fan speed is too low.  There at lots of
&gt;&gt; potential reasons and VeeWee111 has a lot to say about this.
&gt;&gt; One big factor is the size of the crank pulley--VW made
&gt;&gt; different sizes for different motors but didn't mark the size
&gt;&gt; on the pulley.  Larger crank pulley = faster fan.  Also--do
&gt;&gt; you have the correct fan?  VW made many different fans.
&gt;&gt; VeeWee111 has posted often about this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3) Degreed pulleys are nice as a concept, but I was unable
&gt;&gt; to find one worth having.  Two issues: 1) weight: Accd to the
&gt;&gt; Gene Berg catalogue, a crank pulley should not be too light
&gt;&gt; or it affects efficiency in a daily driver.  Most all degreed
&gt;&gt; pulleys are lightened (good for drag racing but not daily
&gt;&gt; drivers).  2) fan speed:  Most degreed pulleys are &quot;power
&gt;&gt; pulleys&quot; which means smaller diameter which means slower fan
&gt;&gt; speed (good for drag racing).  Gene Berg's degreed pulley is
&gt;&gt; actually heavier than stock (good for daily driver) and
&gt;&gt; &quot;stock&quot; size for an older sp motor.  Nonetheless, it is too
&gt;&gt; small for a 1600 in a bus.  See my  post on this at:
&gt;&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/057252.html
&gt;&gt; Best option that I found was to verify the TDC mark on a
&gt;&gt; stock pulley and add my own degree marks.  There are various
&gt;&gt; ways to do this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4) To set max advanced on a distributor w/ *both*
&gt;&gt; mechanical and vacuum advance (e.g. stock dist. for 1600dp),
&gt;&gt; disconnect the vacuum advance (and retard if present), set
&gt;&gt; the timing w/ a timing light so that you have the desired max
&gt;&gt; advance (e.g. 30 deg. BTDC at 3000 RPM), then re connect the
&gt;&gt; vacuum advance.  This works b/c under load, the vacuum
&gt;&gt; advance mechanism does not come into play above appx. 1/2
&gt;&gt; wide open throttle (WOT).  Thus, at 3000 RPM under load, the
&gt;&gt; carb will be + 1/2 WOT and vacuum advance doesn't have much
&gt;&gt; impact on timing.  In contrast, if you pull the throttle open
&gt;&gt; by hand to increase RPMs while the car is out of gear, the
&gt;&gt; carb will be at less than 1/2 WOT, vacuum advance will come
&gt;&gt; into play, and total advance at 3000 RPM will be higher.  On
&gt;&gt; a vacuum advance *only* distributor (e.g. stock dist. for
&gt;&gt; 1600sp), this does not apply.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My general advice:  If you have an overheating problem,
&gt;&gt; return everything to stock.  everything.  tweak it until the
&gt;&gt; overheating problem is resolved.  [Personally, I feel that
&gt;&gt; oil temps over 225 in the sump are a problem.  Where you
&gt;&gt; measure is an issue too.  Sump plate temp sensors tend to
&gt;&gt; measure case temp (which is cooler) rather than oil temp.  I
&gt;&gt; personally noticed a huge difference in readings.  I like the
&gt;&gt; VDO dipstick sensor.  You can do a quick/dirty calibration in
&gt;&gt; boiling water.  Remember, the oil in the heads is likely
&gt;&gt; hotter than the oil in the sump.]  Returning everything to
&gt;&gt; stock will be a lot of work.  No 009s, stock carb jetting,
&gt;&gt; stock compression.....  Once you solve the overheating
&gt;&gt; problem, if you still have any energy and want improvements,
&gt;&gt; change one thing at a time so you can evaluate the effect.
&gt;&gt; Mods that I like include Type IV oil cooler properly
&gt;&gt; installed, full flow oil filter (which I don't have), and
&gt;&gt; alternator (w/ correct alternator belt (different from gen
&gt;&gt; belt!) and backing plates)  I can't claim to have always
&gt;&gt; followed this advice, but any other approach always ends up
&gt;&gt; being more time and $.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; All of this is much less important than the fact that your
&gt;&gt; brakes are working perfectly.  and you have new rubber fuel
&gt;&gt; lines.  and your seat belts are in good condition.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,
