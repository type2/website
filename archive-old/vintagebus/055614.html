Subject: RE:Sump

The following reply is from a friend of mine that
builds motors on a regular basis. As a matter of fact
he hit the mid 12 second time in the 1/4 mile in a
street bug! He knows what he is talking about, just
ask the DKP, he beat their pants off!

Guy is in left field.

If I was afraid of running a sump because of the
mounting nut coming off.......uh....Loctite?

There was an experiment done about 1 year ago (and I'm
sure Porsche or VW engineers performed it along time
ago) where an individual made &quot;windows&quot; in his valve
covers (clear plexiglass or something) to track down a
breather problem. He was amazed at how FULL the rocker
areas got at anything over 3500 rpm (about cruising
speed in an old swingaxle bus with reduction boxes,
eh?)

I KNOW from personal experience that if you zing up a
motor (hot rod bug) or EVEN if you were coming down a
steep hill (Priest Grade rom Yosemite!!) in 2nd gear
in a Bus and yanked it hard through a turn, you'd
probably gulp air in the oil pump because MOST of the
oil would be in the heads (esp. with HD oil pump and
dual relief case).

Sounds like this guy wants to reinvent the wheel.

Sumps aren't for cooling anyway.

take care,
