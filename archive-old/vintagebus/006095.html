Hey list

Got that bad boy running - clutch working perfectly - yahoo!

But I seemed to have deleted the msg's re: reserve valve - a million
apologies to all who responded.  So when I installed it, I installed it in
the upper most position, and when you pull the knob it comes all the way
down - is that the way to do it?  It seems as though gas won't flow unless
the knob is all the way out.  I'm very sure that the level of gas is above
the tube inside.  hmmmmm

TIA
