I think that is why I have bicycle inner tubes as the glass to frame seal, 
cause the glass I had cut is thicker than the German.

&lt;&lt; Actually, you run into problems with the american stock glass fitting into 
 the safari frames.
 The american stock glass is a little bit thicker than the original german 
 stuff and using both NOS and repop seals are a B^%$H.
 Dont tell them its for windshield either!!!!!
 They can refuse to cut them.

 as far as getting one cut for approx. $30.....yes. As for my reference to
 original glass, I was speaking generally. I see people looking for original
 windshields and side pop-out glass all the time. I was just making the
 point that you can easily get a new piece cut. But, as you know, lots of
 people want ALL original. I was just giving my point of view on the subject.
