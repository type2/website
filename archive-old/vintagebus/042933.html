Well, once again some ignorant bastard (pardon the French) thought it
would be a good idea to back into my bus and not leave a note!!!  I'm
thinking that I should get a set of those Hurst bumpers since I'm so prone
to this happening to me.  Maybe I'll make some big, homemade cow catcher
and ram every jacked-up hillbilly F*&amp;d 4X4 just to piss off the rednecks
(no offense to any rednecks on the list).  Anyway, more bodywork practice
for me I guess.
Oh, and I got a parking ticket today, too!  I think I'm just gonna go to
sleep and forget today happened.
