Subject: cars and video

I saw the messages blur by in the past few days regarding kids and
entertainment....  In a totally unrelated task, I came across the
following snippet regarding the growing need for embedded system
developers.

&lt;A key source of that growth, according to Renesas Technology America,
will come from so-called vehicle-based entertainment services. Last
year, this U.S. subsidiary of a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. set out to accelerate the proliferation of
telematics and &quot;car infotainment systems&quot; (CIS) products based on its
SuperH (SH-4 series) RISC processors and chipsets... blah blah blah&gt;


As a 0 TV owner, my stomach churns.  And to think of the poor bastards
50 years from now searching for that &quot;plastic knob for an '06 VW
entertainment remote control&quot;.  Hell, it takes long enough to find the
few parts for a '59!
