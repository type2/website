Subject: Roof hatch

Hello, All...
   Came back from a really terrific VW graveyard today(location secret :)
and ended up
buying a few items for my 65.  Made a deal with the owner to buy 5 jaliouse
camper
windows(all in good shape) for $35 each  and both front and rear
bumpers(also in good
shape w/splash pans &amp; overriders) for $70.  I thought it was a good deal.
   Anyway, while there, I spotted a 64 with a roof hatch. This hatch is
roughly 2'x3' and
and set up above the cargo doors. The bus had wood panel interior(what was
left of it)
but had regular popout side windows.   OK, so what is the hatch used for??
Is it a
Westy item or is it for some working bus use?  Is it worth clipping and
saving?
   Thanks and wishing all a wonderful and prosperious New Year...
