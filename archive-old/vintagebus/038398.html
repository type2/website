Subject: '63 crew is best contender, Sacramento -- seeking transaxle
Date: Wed, 9 Sep 1998 08:58:41 -0700 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Thom did a complete check over for me, plus Jeff (owner) took some more
photos... I think we have an acceptable '63 Crew.  There were a few
previously-unknown body issues that surfaced, but I'm glad that they are on
the table before I flew down...

If anyone has a '63 and down used (working) tranny in Sacramento / Bay area,
I'd love to see if we can work out a deal.  I would need to take delivery of
it Friday...  I know a long shot, but worth the request.  What is the going
rate down there?  All leads or deals appreciated.

The worst projects:
   1) Front nose was dented in and previously repaired.  From what Thom
could tell, he suspected a front tire had been mounted and hit.  Pounded out
and bondo.  Also means the emblem holes are filled.  Tom described this as
12 to 18 inch area.  Is welding in a new part the permanent fix to this?
Window sills are good, and so is the rest of the nose skin...
   2) Right rear wheel wheel and bumper mount is dented.
http://www.ns_dot_net/~schwaia/vw/rear_qtr.jpg is a photo.  Hopefully I can
locate a Seattle area pro who can pull it for me.  Any references out there?
   3) http://www.ns_dot_net/~schwaia/vw/roof.jpg a PO (not current) decided to
cut two holes for his antenna in the roof.  Humm... that's UNQIUE.
   4)  Thom described the wiring as done by a blind man.  His reference was
a little more colorful...

Plan is to drive down Friday, Thom is willing to assist me in changing gear
oil (or maybe I could swing a tranny swap if I can locate one in area).

Thanks for all the support.
