Hmm.  Plugged it into the registry, and it comes up as a Feb according to
the year table I'm using.  There are several '55s older than this one, including the
deluxe you had a few months ago...

Happy b-day anyway!

&gt; a dream being todays my birthday and I've always wanted a year of birth bus,
&gt; the cargo floors are perfect and the right passenger is good and only the
