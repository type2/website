a lot of the wholesalers are importing there springs and valves from Taiwan,
that is why I'm very specific on country of origin and quality on my web
site or when someone calls. If one of my suppliers cannot tell me where the
part comes from or  is made I will not buy them, I am going to have a junk
part sale to get rid of the boxes of inferior parts that I have purchased
but refuse to sell.

G Lyle:

&gt;&gt;Well, the only thing that would allow the keeper to lose tension and move
&gt;&gt;is the spring going loose some time while operating.

Yeah, we were recalling Berg's comments that he sends his rejects back for
the others to sell - he may have had a point!  We are positing either a
metal problem (valve or keeper is made of a softer metal alloy than normal)
or a bad spring, but a higher ratio of bad sproings recently.
My friend has built vw motors for 30 years, and asked me to query the List
on this, as it is a recent problem he's encountered....
