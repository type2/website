wel, the heat in the 59 SC stays in a lot better after messing around with the
doors the other day- in case anyone was wondering.   This at least is a fairly
easy, clean, and cheap way to get closer to the popbottle effect.   I haven't
driven it at night (when it's colder) because of the dumn turnsignals/brake
light not being very visable w/ the head/taillights on, but I did notice more
heat retention- I had to tun it down.   BTW, the taillights are well grounded,
- does anyone else have a 6V  type 2 w/ 58-61 round glass taillights and if so
how do they work for you?  I am thinking of getting a pair of the 67 style bug
backup lights, painting the lenses red with nail polish, and mounting them to
the bumper where the bolt is holding the over rider to guard, with the wire
hooked up for the brake/turnsignal circuit, but it seems like giving up.

Took my spring plates off the 65 westy (Nellie).  It was a PITA.  I used wood
1x2s I custom cut into wedges that I tapped in between the spring plate and
the mounting area to keep pressing the plate out, while tapping the bar in
using a big mallet onto an old hammer handle (w/o hammer) as I didn't want to
mar or mush the metal.   This way only the wood touched the metal.  If I mash
the little teeth on the torsion bar or the spring plate it would be a hassle
putting it back together.    I had the rear corner of the plate on a jack,
jacked up enough for it to clear the edges of the mounting area, once it was
past that  I let the jack down and the right side wiggled free, but the left
side was more tricky, but in the end was successful.   Pounding on this metal
really resonates, and is loud.   I also marked where the splines lined up
originally, and was careful not to knock the inner bits loose, as I don't have
a protractor to set it up if I lose track.  Stuffed rags in he hole with all
that off.   Also marked the plates left and right.  I am cleaning and painting
things, and think I am competely dumb for it, as I could be driving it now if
I hadn't starting giving myself more to fix/do.   But it will be prettier,
have more bits replaced (bushings and dust covers etc) and nicer to work on in
the future.  Oh, I took the spring plates off to put new rear torsion bushings
in, which supposedly should make it handle a tad better.

Maybe I am going further than I need- this will be a driver, not a show car,
but it is also practical to replace those bushings while the tranny is out.
I will have to draw the line somewhere and say enough- it has to go back
together- and stop deciding to fix/ replace more bits and bobs.
