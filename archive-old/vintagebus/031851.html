Subject: 20 g's  59 Westy

  And we thought buses were expensive, how about just the parts off a Westy
for 20 g's. I don't know if any of you caught the ad on VW Planet, but a guy
in Washington was selling everything off of his wrecked Westy. I got hold of
his mother to try to buy some pieces for my Westy and she told me the story
of the bus. After numerous e-mails to her son to try to get the prices on a
few parts, I was informed that all the PARTS were sold to Japan for $20,000
dollars. This was not a whole bus but just the parts, interior, mint tent,
sh#t bucket, all original almost mint interior etc, So I guess all our
Westy's have just gone off the scale in the overseas market, (I didn't break
the Friday rule Thom).
   Being that I didn't get any of the parts I need, does anybody (I heard
you do RD) have a couple of clamshell interior light holders and 1 lens, and
I know this is a long shot a hatch top rod? I got the original table I
needed at OCTO where an almost complete Hatchtop Westy interior with tent
sold for $1300.00, just think if the PO had run into the same OVERSEAS
fellow, he would have easily got the original $3500.00 he was asking.
