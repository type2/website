&gt; i was surprised to see the phrases &quot;cal looker after the big resto&quot; (574 times) 

The &quot;cal looker after the big resto&quot; phrase is in there because it's linked from the hall of shame gallery here: http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/shame3.html 

&gt; this girl ... enjoys a kind of porn few can appreciate.

Ok, that's a statement that demands clarification.  Are we talking Japanese Anime tentacle porn?  Foot fetishism (I can't be the only one)? Dutch fecal porn? Armpit fetishism? I'm going to assume the last one in the absence of any further info.
