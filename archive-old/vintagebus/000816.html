&lt;&lt; last night I was getting ready to put in the dual master cylinder 
conversion into my '65 standard, when I came to a problem in the article in 
the Type2 library article.  It doesn't say where to put the rear brake line.  
The article tells that the front line (after the T) goes in the bottom  45 
degree angled outlet.  It also mentions the two brake light senders, which 
leaves one hole for the rear brake line, but it isn't specified as to what 
goes where.  I'm assuming that the &quot;Dual Cylinder&quot; works in a way that the 
back two outlets are on one cylinder (this being where the front line goes 
into) and the front two outlets are the other cylinder.  Therefore, the back 
line would go to either of these two outlets.  Is this correct?&gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Yes, that is correct.  Either hole will work for the rear brake line.  Just 
be very carefull to not mix up the left front metal brake line for the rear.
 
&lt;&lt;Sorry for all of the questions, but you seem to be the most knowledgable on 
the subject.  In the article you mention not to cut down the front of the 
master cylinder.  The only thing that I can come with for not doing this, is 
that it may bend easy, and if bent will cause problems.&gt;&gt;
Hmm, not sure if we are talking about the same thing.  The front we mentioned 
is the front of the MC as it is mounted.  The front has a cylinder sticking 
out of it that the pushrod fits against.  Since the dual MC is is actually 
two MCs in line with each other the dual MC is longer than the single MC.  To 
shorten this longer MC the forward piston which works the rear cylinders is 
longer, and actually sticks out the front when not in use.  To cut off this 
forward part of this piston makes the MC lose it's seal when the now 
shortened piston is pushed inward past the seals on the front of the dual MC.

&lt;&lt; Lastly, about a month ago, this subject was brought up on the list, and 
someone mentioned using the old master cylinder base as a spacer.  Now I can 
see all of the machining that would be needed to make this work, but what do 
you recommend for this.  Washers, in those kinds of numbers, are too flimsy 
and may not be even, what have you used.  &gt;&gt;
Exactly!  If a lathe was availible the cutting of a junker MC forward end 
would definitely work well, and allow the use of the forward dust boot to 
protect the dual MC.  Unfortunitly so far we have not been able to find the 
single, or dual MC dust boot for less than $10.00 so far.  Probably one could 
make a boot themselfs.
  If one does not have a lathe availible then a flat piece of 1/4&quot; steel, or 
aluminum plate works well after being drilled and filed to work as a spacer.  
Though with this latter spacer system it is very important to use a belly pan 
to help keep out dust/debri out of not only the shift/E-brake/accelerator 
linkage, but the new dual MC as well.  
  So far we have done without the spacer, but it really makes things tight in 
there, and requires cutting down of the body that the push bar threads into.  
Resulting in no room to adjust the shortened push rod unless you unbolt the 
dual MC to get a slight more room in there to do the adjusting.  Then rebolt 
the MC, and check the end play.
