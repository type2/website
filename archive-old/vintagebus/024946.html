&lt;&lt; Can I get by
 with putting it back together and gently driving it five miles to the shop
 so they can put Time Serts in both holes? Should I have it towed instead? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Best to have it towed at this point.
  Unless you want to increase the holding power of the two that are still 
holding by drilling (13/32&quot; diameter) and tapping the holes to about 33-34mm 
depth with a starting tap and bottoming tap and then using 40mm long bolts.  
We always do this when working over any RGB to prevent the problems you are 
having now.  With the spring plate and lock washer the stock 25mm long bolt 
only has about 20mm threaded in.  While this might be adequit for an area 
with only a heavy shear wieght the swing plate as you found out has the 
twisting motion of the plate in relation to the RGB the bolts which tends to 
pull out these short bolts.  Especially after years of abuse and rust damage 
of these internal threads.
  If you do the same to the stripped holes you probably will get them to hold 
with the extra threads at the tip of each bolt and be able to drive it over 
to the shop.  
  Check with the shop with the Time-Sert kit and see if they have the special 
order #12159 inserts which are 30mm in length or contact Time-Sert for this 
length of insert and maybe even get the kit yourself.  These will work well 
with the 40mm long bolts and still be a strength increase over the stock 
length bolt.
  Remember to only use HSS or better drill and taps not the cheapies.  When 
drilling a hole bigger you must use a slow speed drill motor and a very light 
if any pressure pushing the drill bit in.  The drill bit will have a tendancy 
to grab and break off easily when cutting just a little material on the OD of 
the drill when there is not material at the center/tip of the bit.  Using a 
tap/drilling cutting fluid for drilling and tapping is best though just motor 
oil will help keep the tools sharp.  When tapping once you have the tap 
cutting into the material and square to the suface remember to turn it in 1/2 
turn cutting and turn it out one turn to keep the steel chips short as 
possible by breaking them this way and take out the tap every 2 or three 
turns of cutting to clean out those shavings to lessen the chance of getting 
the tap stuck and broken off in there.    Eric&amp;Barb
