It says &quot;BLUE&quot; because it was going to an English speaking country (Port
KA).  Yours which says &quot;BLAU&quot; probably has no port code because it was
staying in Germany.  I have seen buses shipped to Italy with &quot;VERDE&quot; for
a color.  All of this, of course, was before VW changed to a six-digit
color code of numbers/letters and also excludes the &quot;sticker&quot; which was
sometimes(?) placed below the M-Code plate.
