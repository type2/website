Subject: One is never enough

Seeking the knowledge of the Vintagebus list for the first time after many
helpful posts from the type2 list (currently drive a '72 Bay).  I am looking
into the possibility of buying a '66 Splitty with a partial Sundial camper
interior.  Before I get myself in any more trouble than absolutely
necessary, is there anything specific in the way of &quot;one year only&quot; parts or
other idiosyncracies that I should be on the lookout for in a '66 (outside
of the obvious quirks of a 36 year old bus)?  I have been researching split
windows for about a year mostly through lurking on the vintagebus list and
checking out Thom's site.  Looks like I have finally found what appears to
be a solid and fairly presentable bus about 100 miles away (not bad for a
splitty in the Northeast!)  The seller assures me that the brakes, front
suspension and steering are all in great shape, so I am already getting
pretty excited, and will probably make the trip to check it out later this
week.   I do plan to do a checkup per the John Muir method (okay, maybe no
lotus position), but seek the insight of others as well.   Anything weird
with the '66, or is it a relatively easy year to provide for?  Thanks in
advance for your help, hope to be a fellow split owner soon.

									Best Regards,
