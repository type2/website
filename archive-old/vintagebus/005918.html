&gt;Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?

I did, last year.  I used a simple plug-into-the-cigarette-lighter inverter
(at any FLAPS) and just ran the lights through the front door, past the
seal, to my front tire mount.  I took off the spare and mounted a homemade
steel bar that had two holes drilled in it, so it made a good horizontal to
wire an artificial wreath to.  Then I ran the lights around and around,
looked great.

I called the cops first, and their only proviso was that it wasn't allowed
to flash.  Other than that, they said, feel free.

Wish my bus was on the road for this season :-(   I had plans for massive
escalation.  Ah, well, Happy Holidays, my friends.  Be sure to wave.
