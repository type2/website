&gt; Since its Friday. I would like to poll all vintage bus owners to find out who 
&gt; have either vent window latches in good working order, missing or broken, or 
&gt; have since repaired their latches. I am currently a latchless bus owner. My 
&gt; latches have long gone since been broken and I am debating on whether or not 
&gt; to attempt a painful repair procedure this winter. Those who did this repair, 
&gt; please respond separately to me with any advice, suggestions etc....on this 
&gt; vent window latch replacement procedure. 

I did mine using pop rivets and filed them off some on the bottom.  Seemed
to work ok to me.  I got my glass in and out ok, but I've heard this can
be troublesome sometimes.  I used silicone spray on the rubber parts.  
I had trouble getting the little drain deflectors in though and so I left
it out, need to fix it when I go back in.  Any advice?   Now
i have no vent latches on this bus.  One of the many projects I need to
do, but tend to not do them if it doesn't affect reliability and safety.
