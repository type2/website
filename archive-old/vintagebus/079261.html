Subject: Re: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

  The wood in the rgb reminds me of the old used car lot trick of sawdust in the trans to quiet it down. I would attack 
that side first

&gt;well, i finally got time between work shifts this am to do the gear oil
&gt;inspection. no big metal chunks! both rgb's had plenty of fine metal particles
&gt;like glitter in the pan, and the center section drain plug magnets both had
&gt;plenty of fine particles on them as well.  passenger side rgb also had several
&gt;small chips of wood in it!?  fresh stalube all around, back on all 4's, go for
&gt;a drive around the neighborhood, still making plenty of noise.  my question
&gt;has now become since there are no big chunks, can i drive &amp; enjoy it with out
&gt;fing things up?
