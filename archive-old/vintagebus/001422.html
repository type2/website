Hey everyone. I've got a question, What color should the BOTTOM of a bus be?
Take for example my double door panel, I've noticed that the belly pans are
a light grey which appears to be original. However, the front and rear frame
and inside the wheel wells is Sealing Wax Red, which is the original color
of the exterior. My 15 window was basically the same way, only minus the
belly pans. The front and rear suspension and frame as well as the wheel
wells was sealing wax red, but I can't remember what color the middle
sections were. If my panel has the right color scheme, how come the wheel
wells aren't fully painted, they're just sorta misted in the red paint. And
is the engine compartment supposed to be the same as the exterior? I just
need to know to make this resto as correct as possible. Thanks,
Jason
