Subject: Hella headlight lenses...

    I have a set of Hella headlight lenses that the PO of my '65 Type II
ordered back in the 80s sometime as a set of spares....these are NOS...
never been used or installed on anything.
    fluted glass at the top... with &quot;TOP&quot; visible in the upper middle
region of the flutes.
    at the bottom:
    &quot;SB19   SB20 SB21&quot;
    &quot;Hella&quot; logo
    &quot;032-60370-03    MADE IN (&quot;V&quot; w/dot over it) GERMANY&quot;
    I now have a spare set of buckets and lenses and so don't need the
extra lenses...
    I read a post a while ('98...) back where Thom blasted someone for
overpricing NOS items... the post he took issue with had lenses (and
other $tuff...) for $100 (?) per pair... I think that's kinda high,
myself...
    anyone know what the going rate is for lenses such as these?
