&gt;
&gt;Anyone know of VW persons to help or get parts from in the Nevada area?
I'm stuck at a service station at Austin, NV because of a broken hose.  As
a non-mechanical person, I am at the mercy of the local mechanic (?) who
hates VW's.  He ordered a hose from someplace in Fallon, NV if they can't
find the exact one they will send something that will (?) work.  I thought
about calling my mechanics in Portland in hopes they could send one to my
next biggest town which is Ely, NV.  Would have more faith if a Vanagon
lover is out here somewhere!! I'm not on the Vanagon list so maybe someone
could forward this.  Bev Beam stalled on the road in HOT Austin NV.  By the
way, this Hwy 50 is labeled the lonliest highway in America and you can
believe it!!!  bjbeam_at_pocketmail_dot_com
