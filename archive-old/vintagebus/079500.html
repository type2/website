Subject: Re: [VB] Can the BN4 Heater be where the battery is on the
  right side?

Hi Joe,
A BN4 will fit fine in the left side of the engine compartment.  The South 
Wind heaters are the ones you have to cut out the left rear spare tire well and 
screw a plate over the hole to have the heater.  As for the air cleaner it 
would help to know which of your buses this is going into.  The 1955-63 air 
cleaners were swung over to the right of the engine and a special bracket held it 
there.  We might be able to find our Eberspacher bracket to copy for you if 
need be.
