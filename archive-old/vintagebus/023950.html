To prolong your case life, cut the case as little as you can, just enough to clean
it up, and then have the 0.80 thrust bearing lath cut to fit.

&gt; After discovering that the thrust surface of my case is smaller than
&gt; standard, I took it to my machinist.  He measured it and it has
&gt; apparently been cut to .060&quot;!  For those of you that don't know, they
&gt; don't MAKE a .060 thrust bearing - they're only available in .040 and
&gt; .080.
