Subject: Not a rant but a rave.

To the BBB participants,
Thanks for the pics from BBB. Keep them coming. Luckily I have one of
them new fangled cable modems for my connection. Zipped right down. I
feel sorry for all you poor souls with 56K speeds. I could use a little
of the warmth you all are having down there. Omaha is going to see a
highof 20F. Hurry up Spring. I want to get started on the Batmobiles
bodywork again.
I will be in El Paso later this week. Anybody in the neighborhood. What
about parts yards that might have some 65 bus parts?
I will be staying at the Camino Real so leave a message and I will call
if I can get some free time.
