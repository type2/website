The show is at the Sacramento Raceway, on Excelsior Road.  
Take Hwy 16/Jackson Highway away from town, the turn north on Excelsior.

Gates open 8:00am.  Look for my '55 westy - I'll have the tent and
everything set up.

It costs: $10 per person to get in, $10 to get your bus in; don't know
how much it costs to park outside in the lot.  It's not very secure
out there.  People lose parts off of their cars.

Personally I feel it's a waste of time to stay beyond noon.  The swappers
are packing up by then and all that's left is the Silicone Show, I
mean bikini contest.  And the endless droning of the damn drag racers and
the endless, mindless, droning of the announcer.
