You guys find busses in junkyards????
I haven't seen a splitty in a junkyard here in L.A. in 5 years!!!!

&lt;&lt;I used a hack saw and one of those $2 hack saw blade holders to cut

out a passenger door hinge pillar and a piece of the front skin.

Worked OK. Took about 30 minutes of hacking. Surprising how effective.

You could cut up a whole bus, given time and a lot of energy.
