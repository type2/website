Subject: ch ch ch goes the tipper

Hi All,

After rebuilding the carb and fuel pump, the tipper is running great... but
I'm still looking for an HO-case close to my factory original (I've located
a few but I'm still waiting to maybe find one closer...)

Anyway, the one thing that bugs me is that I have a clicking sound coming
from the front end only during motion.  It's more of a 'ch' sound than a
'click' but it is getting a little louder as I drive it.  It does sound
vaguely metallic.  I rebuild all the brakes in it and the wheel bearings
appeared to be good.  I greased them up good and if you jack up the front
end and spin the tires, they rotate smoothly with out a sound or feel of
anything rubbing or grinding.  I also though about the speedo cable but if
you grab the cable under the dash while moving, I feel no vibration.

Any thoughts?

Oh, by the way, I did finally get my custom plates for it.... 'VW TPPR'
:-)

TIA

David
