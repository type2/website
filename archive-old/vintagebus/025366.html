Quick report on the stock height conversion kit that I installed
yesterday.  The hardest part was getting the two bug IRS arm bolts.
Went to the junk yard and found that they use a 17mm allen wrench.  Came
home to get mine and mentioned to my neighbor what happened and he
promptly produced two bolts.

I had to move the heater cables up a bit and then the system bolted up
to the torsion arms.  I set the spring arm angle (much easier than I
expected) and set the arms up and bolted the covers back on.  From there
it was just a matter of bolting the bearing housings in place.

I put the wheels on and lowered the truck back down off the jack
stands.  It looks right on the money.

What's left
Get some new brake hoses
Set the camber at an alignment shop (its close now) then tack the
brackets to set camber
weld two new shock absorber top brackets

This was the Bus Boys IRS II conversion kit.  It looks like it is a
reasonable alternative without having to slam the bus/truck
