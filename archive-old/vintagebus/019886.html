Wow - 80,000 miles - that's a lot!  Well, maybe not...

.._dot_compared to the collective *billions* of trouble-free miles driven by folx
with off the shelf, original, easily obtainable, stock parts, available from
a number of sources, and not one little shop in SoCal; you don't have to
take out a 2nd mortgage to buy them; by people who like to do stuff
*other* than futz with their engine constantly; who haven't been farting
around with engines their entire natural life; and there's no magic vodoo 
or endless experimentation to get the magic combo.  

But stock isn't sexy, and doesn't make for good &quot;tech&quot; articles on how
to make your VW more &quot;sano&quot;.

You Berg disciples should be more low key - if more people were to try to buy
their stuff, either the prices will go up even more, or quality will go down
due to trying to increase production.  They will become a victim of their own
sucess.

I have no interest in making my VW go fast.  I'm just happy if it gets me from
A to B in one piece.   There are other cars for going fast, which do this very
well out of their own box, and generally for less money than it would take to
*properly* get a VW up to the same level.   As an example, I hear the GoFast
guys prattle on all day long about how &quot;stroked&quot; they are, and their webber
42 DNF (did not finish) carbs, yet I never hear brakes mentioned.
