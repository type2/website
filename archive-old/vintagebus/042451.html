hi all,

With all the talk on the vintagebus list lately about how any aircooled VW
should use gl4 only tranny lube, i have been searching high and low for
the stuff with no success, even went to a distributor!

Turns out the solution was right under my nose the whole time.  Jiffy
lube.

They have high quality Pennzoil GL4 lube. 75-80 weight.  Now before you
say i dont want one of their monkeys stripping my drain plugs, read this:

They will sell you just the lube. $1.60 a pound (i think thats what he
said) with a gallon being about 4 lb more or less.  You will need to bring
your own container.

This relaxes me quite a bit, i was worried aobut searching high and low
and finally finding the stuff, then needing some on the road and not being
able to find it... But now i know that in almost any town i can find the
right thing :)

take care,

Steve

p.s. not trying to start a flame war on the topic, i just decided that
since i dont know for sure what to use i'll stick with whats in the
service manual, which is gl-4.
