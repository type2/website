Hey Nate,

Instead of going through all that change and motion, why don't you find an old
Holley Bug Spray. (Available in both 300cfm and 500cfm versions.)  All the HP
without any of the synchronization headaches.  See Tom Wilson's 'How to Hot
Rod Your VW' for details.

But... on the other hand,

The best way to make horsepower with carb changes is to fit one barrel per
cylinder.  Otherwise you experience a phenomenon called 'charge robbing'
wherein one cylinder 'steals' the intake charge from the one next to it.  In a
VW, due to the firing order, cylinder #1 will 'steal' intake mixture from #2.
(1,4,3,2,1) and #3 'steals' from #4. (see Fuel Stand-off below.)   For more
detailed info on this, see Phillip K. Smith's 'The Scientific Design of Intake
and Exhaust Systems'.  This is the method used by that other modifier of
horizontally opposed engines, Porsche.  911, a pair of Solex or Weber 3 bbl.
carbs, 912, a pair of 2 bbl Solexes, 356, same.  All of them bolt the carb
directly to the cylinder head so that there is sufficent heat transfer to
fully vaporize the intake charge.  

Additionally, they use a well thought-out air box to contain that other tuning
phenomonon call 'fuel stand-off'.  Without getting to deep into the physics of
it, it is basically the return 'wave' of air (mixture) that bounces off the
closed intake valve.

As the science fiction writer Robert A.Heinlein said, TANSTAAFL. There ain't
no such thing as a free lunch.  Intake (and exhaust) design is a reasonably
exact science.  By ramdomly bolting on a pair of single barrel carbs, you WILL
make things worse, not better.  I'd be willing to bet that you will experience
a reduction in fuel mileage, horsepower and drivability.  (BTDT, got lots of
t-shirts from ALL the folks that I gave my money to.)

(BTW, I happen to have a 300cfm Bug Spray w/ intake for a single port
1500/1600 sitting out in the garage.  Needs a couple of idle mixture screws.
And an air cleaner.)  If you want to mess with it, let me know and I'll throw
it in for the Deschutes trip.

You might check w/ Fred, he MIGHT have Smith's book.  If not, it's available
&gt;from Classic Motorbooks.  About $20 if I remember.  If you're going to try to
re-do your intake (or exhaust) system, it's a must read.

Jim
