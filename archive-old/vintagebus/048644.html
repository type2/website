&gt;I simply sprayed POR15 clear on all inside panels during the restoration.
&gt;It is a non-porous coating - nothing will get thru from that side. Then I
&gt;just stuck in some fresh new R21 insulation pillows and jammed the panels
&gt;back on.

This is exactly what I had planned to do on my '59. Any reason why we
shouldn't?
