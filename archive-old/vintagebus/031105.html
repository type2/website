the bus-snob sez:
&gt; 12 hours?  12 hours?  what are you driving, a tricycle?  even my bus won't
take 12 hours,...
&gt;
It took me 12 hours last year to drive back from slightly north of LA to
Phoenix, this is about the same distance from LA to Sacramento.

It was real hot in the desert, I felt like I was in hell. (more than usual)

I saw another AZ person towing their Bus back with their air-conditioned
modern pick-up, they had driven the Bus to all the events all weekend. 
Punk.
