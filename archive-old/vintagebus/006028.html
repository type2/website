That is SO true !
I have owned many cars in my life,thankfully most of them buses.
However for some reason most every bus i have owned, some PO has jimmy
rigged the wiring beyond recognition.Also, many buses I've looked at to buy,
some Einstein has had his way with the wiring.I guess the owners knew just
enough to make things scary !?
    But it is always the buses not the b&amp;gs?
    Why is that ?
    party vans?
    killer stereos?
    spinning disco balls ?
