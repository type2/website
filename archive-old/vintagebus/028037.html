Subject: South Florida all busses news
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10103230900070.99306-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I have actually sent the first of a possible south florida newsletter out.
My intention is informal organization and a bit of contact. If you would
like to be included, mail me. If there is any interest Ill make a webpage
where we can share pix of our busses and local folks travels, events etc.

PS the Ft Laud VW show at mills pond park is next weekend (I think).
Hopefully Ill see some of you there.
