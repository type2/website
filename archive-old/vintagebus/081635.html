Subject: RE: [VB] Also looking for........

I'm actually considering this thing... ronnie, pm me.  I'm tired of
searching for panels and the thought of inventing a way to restore
original panels is a thorn in my side.  Much better to get decent panels
to start with.

I once bought two complete pepco superchargers just to get 2 original
screws.
