hey my name is mark and i have a 67 micro and i just got done taking
out the engine completely and took the gas tank out.  After puting in
a new sensor for the gas tank and putting the engine back in, I go to
start my bus and there is no gas getting from the tank through the
line and into the fuel pump.  What is goin on and what can I do to get
the gas up to the pump?  I tried to syphin (sorry suck at spelling)
the gas but it still wouldn't come through.  I am dumb founded.

no gas hmm....

 when you take the line from the tank to the pump off the fuel pump it should
gravity feed and start coming out the line.   Yes?  pt it back on thepump and
try starting it again, maybe prime the carb with a splash of gas.     Usually
it takes about a long count of twelve with teh starter going  to get the gas
up to the carb to start it after having an empty tank.

no?      Okay, you did put gas in right?  Just had to check.    If you blow
through the gas line like you are blowing air into the tank does it work or
is there a clog somewhere?  Did you use new fuel line?  why not- a good fire
prevention measure and should be done probably every 5 years.   I had a lot
of rust in  the tank of my 65 westy when I got it, and it would clog up the
fuel line occasionally until I put a magnet on a coat hanger in the tank to
fish for rust.   If the bus has been sitting a while  that could be a
problem.   hope this helps.
