&gt; Anyone seen pictures?

Hi,

The Brazilian splitties were assembled from kits and sold in South Africa in
the late seventies('75 and '76 fig?)after baywindow production had begun.
They were called 'Fleetlines' do diferentiate them from the baywindow buses.
They differ from the late German splits in a couple of areas. They came with
1600 DP motors, the nose emblem was pressed into the skin, the side cargo
doors had flimsy cross bracing like a barndoor, they had the early style
pull out front door handles and the rear cargo door was of the early narrow
type. I'm sure that fig has photos as he has a few of these vehicles in
various body configurations. Two that are really cool are like 23 windows
without the skylights and sunroof ie. they have windows all the way round
but none on top.

These vehicles formed the basis for a line of hybrid split/bay windows from
Brazil which had a bay nose and rear lights and split just about everything
else. These were really unapealing as you could imagine. 

Later
