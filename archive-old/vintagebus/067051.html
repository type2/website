&gt; When we bolt the strap down tight, the distributor doesn't have play any

Hi Greg&amp;Dan,
Since it worked before the switching of the clamp it sounds like your new 
distributor clamp is badly made or bent incorrectly, and is holding the 
distributor too high.  Dig out the old distributor clamp, install a new nut 
and bolt (The ones off the new clamp will probably work.) into it and 
reinstall it.
  Additionally do take the time to figure out where exactly TDC of #1 &amp; #3 
cylinders are on the lower pulley and insure your #1 spark plug wire is 
attached to the #1 postion on the distributor.  Also buy the VW bus shop 
manual for your year bus reprinted by Bentley.
