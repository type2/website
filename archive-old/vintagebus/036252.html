I've been attempting to talk a local out of a '65 Deluxe
21 window walkthru.  Real nice guy, not sure he wants to
sell it, but he just got a camper and a double door panel, so . . . 
I should hear sometime this week, hopefully before the Bug Bash
so I can sell the '67 HTD.  Anyway, on to the '65 21 WTD . . .

The only rust found is on the cab floorboards up front, and it
has been patched with fiberglass.

I have a theory on the cab floor.  As feet move the mat, it rubs the 
paint, rust forms, the mat rubs the oxides off exposing more metal,
and the cycle continues.  This leads to the Swiss cheese look
so popular amongst busses.

The weird rust is that the cargo area floor against the seat
bulkheads is rusted a bunch.  The belly pans are in great
shape.  Everything else is in great shape.  To replace this 
area I'll need about 8 inches of metal back from the seat backs.
Is this metal available.

rusted through?   Get patches from a donor bus.  
. . .  .  . 
Are there structural concerns with this flooring missing?
- - -- - -  -- -  -
if it is just a small section of the corregated flooring, I wouldn't freak as
long as the main frame rails are good an dthe subfloor is good.
.. . . .. . . . . . . 
Can this be welded without damaging nearby interior or exterior paint?
- - -- - - - 
nope.   the paint close to the welds will be damaged.   But you should clean
it all up really well before patching, get the rust out, and use high zinc
primer and paint after welding on the area that was cleared of paint.    At
least that is under mats/paneling, so  if the paint doesn't match too well, no
biggies.
 ..  . . .  . .
What can be done to slow the rust process in the closed
space between belly pans and floor?
- - - - -
ah- good question.   Before welding up the holes above, sand blast the hell
out of that enclosed area, clean all that out, use that rust eating stuff,
soak it with high zinc primer,and paint it.

The current owner thinks the rubber floor mats encourage
condensation and thus leading to rust under the mat.  I'm
not so sure.  What says the list?
- - - - --  -
the front floors tend to rust due to water leaking through the front windows.
The original floor mats have the hatch patteren underneath- keeping a space
between the metal and rubber mat.       I have seen  floors in the back ,
where it rusted by the sides due to water leaking through the windows (drip
line noticable from windows), but the middle is nice.  This leads me to
believe that leaky windows invite rust, not rubber floor mats. 

Keeping the bus sealed from water, and the heat working is a great idea for
preventing rust as well as for comfort.

my 3 cents,

Clara
