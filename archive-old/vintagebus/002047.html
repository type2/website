Boy did I do it again or what. The old computor has been smoken with
private emails.15 so far. 10 agree with my thoughts, 3 don't in a kind way,
and 2 want to shoot me on sight.
 I did not mean to offend anyone I was just stating how expensive it is
getting to be to get into the Classic and to forewarn people so they know
what the prices are.
 I think all the big promoter shows are getting out of hand as far as price
goes. The Phoenix Bug-O-Rama is getting to expensive also in my opinion.
 I will be going to the OCTO show on Sat that R. K. puts on with help from
other OCTO members and I really like the low one price for all entry fee.
Why can't the VW Classic be at the Pond the next day? or the Long Beach Vets
Stadium which is a great place with lots of room. If D.H. and SOTO could
afford it why not others? Why can't the site be moved to a less expensive
spot with no sales tax? Maybe next year R.K. will look into it.
 I know that the price increase was not R.K.'s idea and he has to pass the
increase up the ladder to us.
 I will be going to the VW Classic this year also ( not going to sell parts
at OCTO or the VW Classic) and pay my $15 fee, hech I would pay $50 it that
was the price ( I would bitch, but pay) after all it is THE CLASSIC, I just
think prices have got out of hand at this show and others.
 The San Jose Vintage Show was only $30 to get in and swap and it was one
of, if not the best VW show I have ever been to, no In-Out-Burger, but still
the best.
  Anyway this is an apology to R.K. and anyone else I offended with my
previous post.
 Was thinking of going to the Las Vegas B-O-R this Oct. ( you know who it
promoting it) but will wait for the prices to come out, the entry might
equal my gas costs to go to Buses and Balloons again this year in Albuq.
 Hope whom ever is forwarding my list posts to R.K. will forward this one
to him also.

Enough said, see you all Friday night at Rich's.

John Howard
