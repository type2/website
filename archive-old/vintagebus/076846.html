Subject: engine test

Howdy,

           I need to run my engine out of the bus to locate an oil leak.  I 
have a cutaway bellhousing to hold the starter on the flywheel.  I have the 
negative battery cable grounded to the bellhousing and the positive cable to the 
starter. I also have a wire going from the positive battery cable to the coil. 
 By crossing the starter contacts I am able to start the engine.  Is this the 
correct way to do this?  Do I need to hook up the generator?  Is this safe?

Thanks
jon
