Subject: Re: [VB] a Phriday question

Could be a swap meet/wrecking yard item. I think early Westy tanks are fiberglass and the bay era ones are plastic. I would guess a little bleach and some hot water would clean them out just fine. I don't see why resin couldn't be used to fix leaks or a non-toxic epoxy.
