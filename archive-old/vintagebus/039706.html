I'm in the process of recovering the bare seat frames in my '67.  I've put 
the old twiggy seat pads back on and added some cotton sheets on top to 
strengthen and cushion them.  I received the stock mesh platinum seat cover 
set from Wolfsburg West and am starting to put them on.
Now, my question.  When putting these coveres on, they don't fit &quot;tight.&quot;  
I've noticed there are little hooks on the under side of the seat frame.  
The thing is, on the old upholstery, these hooks were used to wrap around a 
metal rod that was sewn into the stock seat covers.  The seat covers I have 
don't have this rod in them.  How can I get these things to stay on tight?  
Anyone have any experience with this?
Thanks,
-Wes
