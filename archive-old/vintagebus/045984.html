I acquired a 67 bus (well, the title says 66, but everthing else looks
67).  Anyway, the chassis number (on the fresh air vent and in the
engine bay) says it's number 257076396.  I have yet to find a book where
this number range even exists.

your bus has the 3rd digit a 7- meaning a 67 model.   It is an early 67,
buildt in Dec 66 most likely.   You can find the exact production date on the
M code tag on the metal partition behind the passenger seat.   There is a
complete explanation of the Tag on the NEATO web page, I'm told.
