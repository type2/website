Hello,

Hold the flames because I AM NOT TRYING TO STEAL A BUS:)

There is a 1969 bus for sale at a very low price in my area( clear title).
Beacuse of major problem with our family car I might be cheaper to by this
bus then get the volvo fixed.

The bus ran ok when last parked  over a year ago but the key has been lost.
I want to go look  over the bus and see about buying it but I really want to
get it started while I am there.

Can a bus be started and driven with the key in the off position. The owner
reports that if there is a steering wheel lock is does not work so that is
not an issue. Any adivce in the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Please respond privately.
