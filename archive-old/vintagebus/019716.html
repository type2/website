My friend would be the southernmost listee- if he is
indeed subbed to the list. I suspect that if and when
he checks in it would be via
www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect.

Conversely, who is on top?

Jim's friend in Antarctica flys out of Christchurch to
get to the Ice and he certainly would be the southern
most list member!
