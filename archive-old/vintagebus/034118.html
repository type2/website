they make self tapping studs just for this situation, also there are case
savers up to 1/2 in diameter for the 10 mm stud, oh to put us threads in a
metric case but it works as long as you don't have a Hot Rod engine.

ps. i do stock these

Subject: [VB] Head stud pulling out of case...options?



It appears that one of my head studs is pulling out of the case. I went to
do a valve adjustment, and noticed the nut was loose. I got out my torque
wrench and attempted to torque it to 22 ft-lbs, but it wouldn't get
there.... so I took a look and the stud is pulling out of the case. 
What are my options for fixing this? Replace the case? Is it drivable, or
is that  a definite no?
