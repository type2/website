I found out yesterday that this is Bob Sowersby's bus.  Bob lives in
Irvine CA (Southern).  Those of you who know him know how nice the  was
and just how much he drove it.  It was nice enough to be a trailer
queen, but Bob drove it regularly!  Speaking with someone yesterday at
Pomona, they told me that the bus was parked his driveway in front of
another car.  The thieves dragged it sideways across a flowered and
lawn.  It was only parked outside the one night.  That's all it took.
They'd been waiting for an opportunity most likely.

Seems like these wacky out of sight prices people are speculating on are

just too much temptation for cowardly thieves.  I'd keep um' locked up
at night folks.  I'll bet a few people will be sleeping in their busses
instead of resting comfortably in the hotel while at the Classic.
