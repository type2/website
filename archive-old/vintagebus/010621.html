Okay, now I found the pics at the bottom of the page (duh)   It doesn't look 
that bad, really.  I have unfortunately tipped a bus over myself, (not 
rolled, that is going all the way over and around, right?) and the tool box 
aimed for my head, not a bad idea to strap it down, though I never have.   
Funny thing that bus had sigla windows, and none broke, I was amazed. The 
worst damage was that the rain gutter above the drivers door was broken by 
the roof rack, which meant the rain fell on your head when you got out of the 
bus.   My 65 westy was tipped as some point by a PO, and you can barely tell. 
  I had a bit of pulling down and dent removal before painting it.   In fact 
only one person has ever told me that they noticed.  Anyway, now you have the 
perfect candidate for the rough and ready back country bad roads camping bus.
