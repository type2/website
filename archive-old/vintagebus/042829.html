&gt; Yokohama sells a tire called the _ Geolandar H/T _ that seems well suited

&gt;   http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/yokohama/yo_geolander.htm
&gt; And Yokohama produces, but Discount Tire didn't stock, the tire in a 205 /
&gt; 75 / 15 size.  Problem is that they 205 size isn't &quot;C&quot; load rated in the
&gt; book, which I had requested.  Not sure about the plys either.  As we didn't
&gt; have a tire in front of us...  Anyone have one of these tires and care to
&gt; fill me in on the load capacity and number of sidewall plys?  It is
&gt; classified as a &quot;light truck/SUV&quot; tire, but isn't &quot;LT&quot; in the model number?

think Honda CRV.  Every CRV I've worked on had Geo H/T's on 'em.  205's,
if I recall.  B load, for every intent and purpose a passenger car tire
(which is really all these SUV's are!)

35 PSI max pressure, and all that, too...:/   15&quot; tires can carry more
wieght per load class, though.  A load B 215/15 will probably be rated at
near 1600 pounds per tire...

Of course, having to run low pressures in these tires does not help where
our busses need it, which is sidewall flex, in corners and from the
wind...


&gt; So, anyone out there with the _ Geolandar H/S _ who can let us know if they
&gt; are a) M+S rated, b) max PSI  c) Load capacity,  d) number of sidewall plys.

a:  Perhaps.  I cant really remember, though.  b: definitly 35. c: B. d:
not sure. 2/2 I think.

disclaimer:  this is from memory, and looking at dozens of differnt cars
at the shop, when I needed tires, and wondered what might be close.....and
it's a sunroof shop, not a tire shop!:)

later...david
