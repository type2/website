Subject: Re: Grounding Tail Light Bucket - Not Metal?

&gt;From: &quot;David Mayes&quot; &lt;mayesd_at_dsquared-dev_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Normally grounding actually works well if it's all put together nicely
&gt;with good parts.

I agree to a point.  I know these worked OK when they came out of the
factory and that restoring them to original condition will work.  I
just prefer having the ground wires for extra peace of mind.  The best
argument I have for them is that VW themselves did it after about 1967.
Also, the driver of the Escalade that is about to plow into you because
he or she didn't see your brake lights doesn't really care that your
taillights are correct-ink-stamped OG with no non-stock wires...

&gt;I would hesitate to run a wire all the way back to the negative post of 
&gt;the battery.

Why?
