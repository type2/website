Subject: electrical help (65 samba resto)
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Over the weekend i was trying to problem solve the
electrical gremlin in my bus.  Can anyone give me some
direction here.  

The bus has a new harness for my year (65) and i am
99% sure that all the switches and stuff work.  Here
is the simptoms.

Everything works just fine and as it should except for
the brake lights when the key is off.  This includes
all lights, turn sig's and emergency flasher system. 
(btw, this is all 12v) (also, the turn signal light on
the dash is dim which may be a clue but i do not know)
I do have the gas gauge and clock disconnected because
they are still 6v.  I am also breaty sure that the
turn sig switch is in good shape.  

When i turn the key switch to &quot;on&quot;, the turn signals
and emergency flashers will not work anymore. 
Nothing.  Everything else seams to be all right.  As
soon as i turn the ignition back off, wala.  It all
works again.

Any clues here?  I took the hole wire harness under
the dash out yesterday and very carfully re-connected
everything.  I cross referenced both the harness kit
and the bently manual to make sure i got it right.  I
am also sure that there are no bad connections or
shorts.

Any help would be greatly apreciated.
