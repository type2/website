&quot;Dead man walking&quot; Ellis schooled us with:
&gt;Flame bait? OK, how about that comment from the guy
who posted a collage of barndoors on Thoms website
encouraging folks to &quot;Come on people! Spend some
money!&quot; Is the economy slowing down? Perhaps I was
just ahead of the curve in my Barndoor sales
adventure. It looks like it's other peep's turns. If
the economy isnt slowing down then why is everyone
selling the last individual pitty-pat item out of
their garages on eBarf and on the two main vw sites?
Sales of  rat sawzall test buses seem to be on the up
swing.
&gt;
I think there's been a slowdown of overpriced stuff and/or projects, I do
know of some nicer VWs that have recently changed hands.

Speaking of that, I know of 1 person looking for a decent 21/23 driver for
under 10k and another who wants a &quot;finished&quot; resto-custom 21/23 for under
20k.  Oh yeah, the first person requires that the 21/23 have a ragtop
sunroof.  Bahahaha!

Seriously though, contact me if you are interested in selling and I'll
provide their emails...
