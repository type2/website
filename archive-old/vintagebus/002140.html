Subject: sundial questions, rear bumper,childs cot

I need some info on cutains for a Sundial. Does anyone have any pictures
of original curtains in a Sundial. More importantly the type of curtain
rods. Did they use the spring
type top and bottom or some type of rod? I have 67 and it has nothing. How
rare is a Sundial with all popouts.
My Sudial was a Kombi by birth. I thought Sundial were all based on panels.
Any info out there?
Does any body have a nice rear bumper that they want to part with?I am also
looking for a front childs cot that I can reto fit in it. Any body got one
with brackets? I am located in Delaware.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
