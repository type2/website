Hi all,

Hate to keep bugging everyone, but this bus is acting up again.  Drove her to
work today (10 miles each way) On the way home, sitting at a stoplight, clutch
pedal depressed, I start to hear a moaning-grinding sort of sound.  Put her in
neutral, let clutch pedal out, sound goes away. Push it in and it's back. Just
had the trans and clutch replaced so I'm certain it's related.  Maybe the
clutch plate is still making contact?  What do you think?
