I have a 1500.00$ rear tailgate for a pickup hanging on the wall.
Anyone interested?
Maybe its not volkswagen? I dunno, it doesnt have those side pressings like 
the ones I have seen. =)
Its nice, original paint, no dents, no rust.
Hasn't been in storage EVER.
Need to feed the family, Must sell. ;-)
Anyone got a 52-53 pickup for me to put it on?
Anyone remember seeing a 58 singlecab with a smooth rear tailgate running 
around int he mid 70ies?

&lt;&lt;well....there was no cash involved....so I really couldn't say.
I would think one this nice would pull in over $1K easy...but.. no cash
involved.  period.  I would not sell it for money.  There is a picture of it 
in
the www.vintagebus_dot_com image gallery under &quot;rare parts and accessories&quot; or
something like that...
