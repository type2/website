I must now pontificate...

Agreed...

&gt; Additionally, this is not the temperature of the oil going to the bearings, it
&gt; is the temperature of the oil going to the oil cooler. 

This is true... but consider that when the engine is at operating
temperature, a lot of oil goes through that particular channel first. If
the engine is overheating, most of the oil will be going through that
galley since the oil pressure relief valve will hardly be depressed, if
it's working. Sensing the oil temp upstream of the bearings, and
upstream of the oil cooler, will give you a better representation of how
hot the oil is after it does it's job of lubricating/cooling and
splashes down into the sump, but maybe not better than a sump-mounted
sender would.


&gt; All in all, on a stock engine there isn't a 100% accurate location to measure
&gt; oil temperature. 

Perhaps that's because the oil temperature varies, and we have to
understand why it varies in order to interpret oil temperature results.

  I personally prefer the oil plug on the sump for two
&gt; reasons:  1) there is exceptional oil flow, and 2) it's where Porsche puts
&gt; their temp sender. 

I believe that it would be (a little) better to install the oil temp
sender on the sump rather than a tee fitting for the flow reason... but
the empirically objective thing to do would be to install two senders
and two gauges and compare the results. I don't think the results would
vary by a great factor, but then again i am not sure...
On the other hand, we could use a type 3 oil cooler, which i believe has
a place for an oil pressure sender... an oil temp sender could be
installed, but clearance might be a problem...
