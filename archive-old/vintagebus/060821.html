Subject: Re: [VB] Blue Book fro Busses?

&quot;Blue Book&quot; values are just about useless with older cars.  There are
so many variables as far as condition, correctness and wild swings in
the market (think 'eb*y') that it's impossible to nail down a range.
It's one thing to take a 2 year old F*rd Excretion and say &quot;deduct $X
for every N thousand miles&quot; and &quot;add $X for the tow package&quot;, quite
another to say &quot;deduct $X for a brazilian-engine and $Y for the rust
in the rocker, but add $Z for the hula girl on the dash&quot;

Your best bet is to wing a price and see if anyone bites.  If they don't,
lower the price or take it off the market.

&gt; My searches on type2_dot_com archives aren't coming up with much - can anyone
&gt; help w/ a link?
