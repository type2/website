&lt;&lt; Actually, you do. Because the stock heater blows air into the cabin for
 heat, obviously it needs some way to get out. If you crack a window open it
 will allow the heated air into the cabin easier and allow for more volume. &gt;&gt;

Hi Kyle,
Yes, and no.  This a is a good idea to get maximum heat to the windshields to 
deice or defog.  The problem is the venting window is high up in the body and 
heat rises and goes out there just that much quicker.  The best solution 
would be to have a window way low in the body instead.  Also the person who 
cracks open a slider or wing window get most of the heat on that side of the 
front seat due to the heat heading out that window!  We have done this lots 
of time.  Barb being the usual female thermal vampire needs more heat during 
the fall and early spring, while Eric often needs less.  Result is Eric opens 
a window on his side and Barb gets even more chilly while Eric is getting 
even more heat due to it heading out his window!    Eric&amp;Barb
