Subject: RE: [VB] Air Cleaner Question

You mean they put other things in a T-2 besides dual ports? heh he, sorry.

Really?  The stock one barely fits on my '60.  How do you get the carb
low enough for the clearance of the air cleaner, or is this a dual-port
thing?  (I've never had a dual-port engine)
