&gt; I understand there's nothing but a circlip holding it? Is that right?

Yes and no... the two halves of the input shaft are splined on their
OD's, but they are drilled &amp; tapped for an 8mm (?) stud in their ID's...
the circlip merely keeps a larger coupling piece (splined on the ID to
match the shafts' OD splines) in place, so that it transmits the
rotational force... what's *really* holding it on there front-to-back is
the threaded stud... 
 
&gt;         -- dismantle the engine from around the crank, ending up with a
&gt; transaxle with a flywheel, gland nut and crankshaft welded to the end of
&gt; it. I don't know what I would do with such a thing, it won't even burn. 8)

mebbe with a little extra oxygen... naah.

&gt;         -- try to take the differential out of the trans, detach the shaft,
&gt; and end up with an engine with a trans shaft welded to it. Start cutting
&gt; the clutch off then? I dunno. From Joe's Bentley it looks as if this
&gt; approach is do-able but even if it is, it probably won't be obvious what is
&gt; stuck to what.

Someone mentioned pulling the tranny and engine as a unit... which I
think would be good if continual rocking back &amp; forth doesn't free
things up... 
	Then you could try wedges all the way around the gap... but that would
put extra stress on the threaded holding spots on the input shaft halves
and the stud itself... gentle use of wedges, liberal use of a
penetrating lube... rocking back &amp; forth.
	Last-ditch... full-on disassembly. tranny out or tranny in bus... I'd
find the easiest way possible to get the diff out of there... maybe
easier with tranny out, etc... (might have to remove both axles, the
crown gears &amp; shims and that snap ring, and so on... depends on where it
is and how you do it...) then all ya gotta do is to get that circlip out
of the way and slide the coupling up to where the splines are not
touching any one half of the input shaft... and it will turn (perhaps by
rotating the motor...) ... and unscrew itself, freeing up the shaft to
come out of the tranny.
	You won't have to cut the clutch off, I think... the shaft is probably
seized to the clutch disc splines and not the gland nut needle bearings
or that area, IMHO. heat and some light lube &amp; tapping should get things
freed up, once the disc &amp; shaft are free of the engine.
