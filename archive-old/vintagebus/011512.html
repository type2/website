Well I was just sitting down to write up the reports on my two week trip
from the blazing Phoenix, AZ heat up to the Pacific Northwest Cascade
Kombi/SIR weekend and back. This boring report was to include meeting Phish
friends/sisters of Poor Richard driving a baby blue rabbit which was
purchased by a fellow listee, the meaning of &quot;puffing&quot; and 6-up at 4:20 on
the 5, wiring fires, mechanical redos, a lowly trophy whore of a camper bus
keeping up with the Berg Cruisers, a first place win at the Vintage meet,
total burn-out at the SIR show, sleeping with Pigs and their farmers, 11
hours sleep at a very noisy truck stop and zero sleep in a State park,
Camping amongst the giants, nostalgic thoughts of a busty hippie chick in
Garberville circa 1977, surviving Humbolt county's finest, locations of
vehicles left un-rescued and sweating at 240 degrees near Blythe.

Also, I was going to announce a change of stats and the details on how I was
able to secure &lt;steal&gt; that '54 Barndoor Ambulance/Camper conversion that
languished on Klaus Jacobsen's Strictly Vintage website. Add that to the
24hr turn around trip to LA and back to trailer the thing home. Importing a
bus from the planet &quot;Uranus&quot; sight unseen is relaxing, fun, and easy! It's a
worthless POS anyway even though it runs, drives, has quite few unique
features, looks good, and came with tons of rare poop...

Lately, I have been self-absorbed by waking up at 04:00 leaving the house by
05:00 getting to work at 06:00 and doing 10 hours then off to school until
ten pee-em. Shawn is right. I don't want to bore anyone with creative
literature of a half crazed man. I gotta get some sleep and do my ten hours
again on Saturday.
