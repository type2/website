&gt;Any suggestions on moving back in time to a split? Obviously the
&gt;normal bus rules apply (slow) which isn't a problem, just wanted any
&gt;suggestions or comments on differences between my busses other than
&gt;the obvious cosmetic changes.

Stopping is mandatory:
Splits have 4-wheel drum brakes with no power assist.  They won't
stop quite as fast as a bay with front discs.  Try them out, from
speed, on an off-ramp or something before you head out.

Going is optional:
If your bay has a 1600 I don't think you'll notice much difference.
If you're used to a 1700+ engine, you'll probably notice.  VW said
that the top speed of a '66 was 65 mph _at_ 4040 rpm.  Many people
prefer to keep the revs below 3600.  Compare that to an early 70s
bay: 68 mph _at_ 4100 rpm (1600) or 78 mph _at_ 4660 rpm (1700).

&gt;Anybody got anything other ideas that would be split specific?

Things that might come up relatively soon include...

Splits have a 10.5 gallon fuel tank.  VW claimed 24 mpg, but that
was running at half load, at 75% of top speed, on a level road.
You'll probably get something like 20 mpg, but it might be better
to plan on a 150 mile range on a full tank until you know better.

There are three places to check the gear oil: one on the trans and
one on each reduction gear box.  Depending on the gear box and what
tool you have, you might have to take off the rear wheels to get
the top plugs out.

The front wheel bearing adjustment is two nuts and a lock plate, but
I am told you can put the clamping nuts from a bay on there instead.

Buy the '63-'67 Bentley manual!  Available from finer VW parts vendors
everywhere.

More people will smile and wave when you drive a Split.  :)
