Hi. I have a 67 split camper for sale. I bought it years ago and never =
fixed it up. It is a beater, but a great project for someone looking for =
one. It is currently not running, but it was when I parked it two years =
ago.  Needs brake and body work. I have a new master cylinder and wheel =
cylinders for it.=20

I will let it go for the $800 I have in it. I want to get rid of it in =
the next few weeks or less.

If interested, give me a call at 770-438-2045 or email me.  I have =
pictures if anyone wants to see them.

Larry
