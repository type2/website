Subject: Re: [VB] concrete slab

&gt;That's good advice.  For curing, I recommend plastic sheeting over
&gt;the whole slab and keeping it wet underneath for at least a week.  It's a
&gt;pain to keep it under plastic for that long, but in the end you get a much
&gt;stronger slab and reduce the chances of cracking.  As soon as the slab
&gt;gets dry it ends the curing process.

this is actually not so. in fact, the curing process seems to have 
literally NO END since concrete keeps changing. It is very mysterious 
stuff. all of the chemical reactions which go into its formation are not known.

ALSO, it will eventually crack, despite rebar, thickness and careful 
formulation and curing. and crack control joints. In my other life i 
was an architect, am married to an architect who specialized in 
concrete structures. cracking is the nature of concrete, not a bad 
thing, it is just what it eventually does no matter what.
