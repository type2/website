&gt; You need the super big fat screwdriver.   I have one that used to have
&gt; wood on each side of the handle and fits the slot properly.   Then I
&gt; put a pair of vice grips on the flats parts of the handle.   Push up
&gt; and turn.   Not much oil falls out.  If the plug is messed up, I am
&gt; sure many listees have spares.

&gt; Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest
&gt; impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered
&gt; some damage as well.  The thing will not move! (even though it is
&gt; covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
