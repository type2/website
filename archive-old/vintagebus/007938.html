This might be true, on the Westy the splash pans are black top and bottom,
although the original color of the body appears to have been Pearl White.

&gt; My 57 left the factory with sand green bumper brackets. The splash pans
were
&gt; painted semi-gloss black and the tops were sprayed sand green to match the
&gt; body.
&gt; They probably switched this at 58 when they stopped painting the bumpers
the
&gt; same color as the body, correct?
&gt; Were the early ones different from the later ones?
