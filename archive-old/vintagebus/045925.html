Hi Eric,
Yes we have!  Due to badly made aftermarket distributor clamps that only 
contact the distributor at two or three points instead of all the way around 
the clamp interior circumferance.  Either get a original or sit down and half 
round file the aftermarket distributor clamp so it's interior is more round 
and contacts better with the distributor.  Eric&amp;Barb
