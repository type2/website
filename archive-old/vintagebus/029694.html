If they are little bubble like dark red taillights then you've got a
post march 55/ 56 bus.
Take anything that you can get. The body number will be on the passenger
side bulkhead behind the front seat. It will give you an approximation
of when it was built but the VIN is the true identifier. Something in
the 100,000 are around 55-56. My 56 double door has a VIN of 185722 and
a body number of 175302. The Vin says it was made in may of 56.

&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I went anf looked a a parts bus today. It was complete
&gt; but basicly rust holding hands. It is an early bus,
&gt; has little round tail lights , bullet turn signals and
&gt; the vin plate in the motor compartment resembled the
&gt; ones Ive seen on oval and split beetles, but i couldnt
&gt; make out the # due to poor lighting. its not a
&gt; barndoor. are there any parts i should pull besides
&gt; the obvious. how about brake drums?
&gt;  Thanks----Bryan
