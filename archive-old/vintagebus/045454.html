&lt;&lt; I have been saying that I need a rear hatch, but what I need is the decklid,

your engine will run cooler with an engine lid, the engine compartment will get pressurised, and also the hot air from unde rthe mottor wont swirl back in there.  Yes, check out the swap meets.   Prices vary due to condition of decklid. 

also= get one the right year for your bus- 67/66 have the push button latch, and take the apron for that.  if you have rollers on the right side of your engine compartment, you need the spring style latch to hold it up, etc.  what year is your bus?
