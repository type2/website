Subject: valve guide question

i encountered a valveguide oddity today:  all the guides the local 
shop had in stock for a 1600 were 2.4&quot; long (61mm); my head rebuilder 
says he needs guides 2.625&quot; (66.7mm). the reason he wanted to replace 
the existing guides (besides being too loose) is that he said several 
didn't come all the way down the bore. now, i imagine the intake 
guides might have been cut and retapered for flow, but the exhaust 
puzzles me. rebuilder is uncomfortable putting shorter guides in - 
esp on exhaust. he CAN get what he feels is the correct length from 
houston; oddly enough it is the same vw part #.

any insights?
