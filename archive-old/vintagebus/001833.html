Subject: Latest pics from SA, my 61 Westy

Hey Volks

Some of you may remember me telling about buying a 61 Westy a while ago.
Well, I got the bus home last week.

It's the oldest Westy I've seen in South Africa. Not to say that there
aren't any older -- I just haven't seen them. Split Westies are very rare
here, and I've only seen a handful of them.

Check out pics on Thom's gallery:
