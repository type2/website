The Goodtimes Motorsports Bug Bash in Pleasanton
(San Francisco Bay area) is coming up August 15th.
Some ads show 15/16th, but Sunday is for 'other' imports,
of the western Pacific variety.

I hope to be able to make it in my bus and allow it to be seen,
with no preconceptions of winning beside disgusted looks.

I haven't seen any flyers, nor is there any useful information
on the web about this show.  I called them direct last Friday
to confirm the date, but that's about all I could get.  They
will (hopefully) sending me a flyer, and when I get it, I'll
post a few more details.

BTW, RVB didn't 'post' about his '88 Buick Leadmaster,
he cheated and put it in his signature.  That may not
count as a post, but it sure works as a subtle way to
advertise things for sale.  That's how I sold my '80 Westi,
ands how I found some needed bits and pieces.
Now if I can only sell my  . . oops . . .  it's not a VW!

'67 Sqbk    '64 Ford Crewcab 
'87 Subaru 4WD   '97 Nissan Quest

P.S.
I even enjoyed Jim Ellis Flame about trip reports, although I didn't see
how his
Blatent advertisement trying to UNLOAD his 88 Buick has any 
relevance to the list!
P.P.S. 
My husband and I will be in Northern California between the 13th and
17th of August
does anyone know of any &quot;bus happenings&quot; during that time period?
