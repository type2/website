This is a Friday thing so read at your own risk.

In response to an email that was sent to some local bus people regarding the
formation of a club we received the follow unsolicited but heart-felt
response from an  S.O.

Being merely peripheral to but ever mindful of the - well, &quot;hobby&quot; would not
be the right word, but perhaps &quot;religion&quot; would be too strong a word - ok, I
will settle on &quot;quest&quot; of the you's and John's and Matt's and Doc Ric's,
etc. 
of the elusive VW, I must comment on the post John forwarded to me about the
(hopefully) imminent formation of a (quote) loose knit but hard drinking bus
club.

First of all, your suggestions for names are just great (I loved ETC, John
loved Neighborhood Bullis, which I also like a lot but the acronym lacks
something).

Second of all, I have long been a member in the club-of-one-member (me) that
I like to call
Wives
Etc. of
Newly 
Acquired
German-
Engineered
Motorvehicles, or, of course,
WE NAG EM.

The VW's get in the way of fixing faucets, taking kids to soccer practice,
buying new kitchen floors, and getting from point a to point b at 80 miles
per hour.  They make our spouses come home late (they thought they had an
extra clutch cable), bring home strangers (broken down by the side of the
road in an old VW bug), cause comments by the neighbors (ANOTHER bus?) and
eat up disk space (GET those pictures off the hard drive honey, do you
really 
need 40 pictures of splitties?).

I am stuck for words here, but what I am trying to say is yeah, we nag you,
we ride you, we occasionally lose our minds because we think your priorities
are skewed, but then we go to a campout or even just take a few minutes to
take coffee out to the garage where you're working, and then we get our
reward.  A hundred times over.  Sometimes more.  We learn patience.   We get
to meet people we might never pay attention to if we met them on the street.
We learn how nice 40mph is on the road.  We learn that if you just scrape a
little rust away you may find a treasure.

I KNOW what I want to say here, and it is personal.  I am just really happy
and grateful to have met you and other proud VW owners and whatever it takes
to support your club, I am there.  Because there is diversity and kindness
and community that bleeds out of this VW crowd like air out of new brakes.

Thanks for letting us peripherals in too.

Love and gratitude
Donna
