Subject: RE: [VB] Cruise control in a splittie!

The best cruise control that I made is using a broom handle puting from the 
acelerator to the panel. Only you need to cut the necesary distance to keep 
the velocity.

Welcome to mexican tips.

   What does this unit use as a road speed sensor?

I installed a VDO unit years ago on a 71 and it had two magnets that were 
mounted 180* apart on the inner CV and a transducer mounted on a bracket to 
read them.The throttle actuator was a nice strong electric motor and not 
vacume.

 &gt; Well gang,  I'm almost done fitting a cruise control unit to my 64 delux!
 &gt; I had always thought about doing it, and looked at the kits that are 
offered at the autoparts stores, but never took the step of trying it until 
I read Donald Gibbons page listed at type2_dot_com.    Seeing that he had 
sucessfully installed it into a 75 Bay window with FI (not sure if he has 
the 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0), I figured, I've been doing enough out of state 
driving, that I could benefit from something like this.
