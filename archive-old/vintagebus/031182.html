&gt;According to Michael Steinke of the Bulli Kartei Bus Club in Germany, M
code 544 is &quot;Something special that didn't come at the assembly line--perhaps
the cut singlecab gates (544 - KW 544, KW means &quot;Kundendienstwerkstatt&quot;--&quot;service
room&quot;, a special place for conversions done by Volkswagen itself).&quot;

Hey, ask him what 18, 83, and 86 are... or maybe we can get him to go down
the M-code list on my web site and fill-in the blanks.  I'm sure Thom would
love to update his registry program as well.

&quot;Service Room&quot;?  That brings to mind some other possible m-codes...
