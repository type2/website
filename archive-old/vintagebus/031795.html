Subject: [VB] Westy Subhatch Question


List:

Like most things on my bus, the subhatch had been dismantled by the time I
took ownership of it.  Thus, no record of how it is supposed to be mounted.

I have the new veneer panel, both hold downs and the prop installed.  What I
don't know is what washers, grommets, spacers, etc. go on both the exterior
roof side and interior side of the 4 hinge bolt studs.  Can any subhatch
Westy owner out there give me a detailed description of the EXACT order of
what goes when and where when mounting the hatch?  This would probably only
be feasible if you've disassembled your hatch fairly recently.  For some
reason I remember reading a post by someone a few months  ago that lead me
to believe there are more metal and rubber washers up there than one would
expect.

As always, TIA!

Robert
