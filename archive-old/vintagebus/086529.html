&gt; I just want to know what the PO was thinking when they did some of
&gt; the wiring hacks. Wow. I think a large part of it was drug induced.

A lot of people don't like the stereotype, but these vehicles *are* 40+
years old, and a lot of living has happened inside them.  With a new-to-
you VW, it can help to spend a rainy weekend poking into all the nooks
and crannies behind the trim panels and such.  It's a lot better to find
NOS chemicals when the Bus is sitting in your garage, rather than when
you've gotten pulled over for failing to get with the program and buy an
Escalade.  &quot;Dude, that's not mine&quot; is typically not a very successful
defense strategy.
