Hello List,

    I am new to the fraternity of bus owners. In fact I haven't owned a
volkswagen sense I had an almost new 1956 bug. I now have a 1966 type 2
Microbus that was given to me.
    I would like to turn it into a camper of some type. Any thoughts on
this?

    Regards,

    Jerry Barr    jbarr_at_itol_dot_com
