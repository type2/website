Subject: Re: [VB] 6 Volt Devon Light

Hi John,
Huh?!?!  First off if you have a Devon camper then we would just use a  
voltage drop with that light.  If you do not have a Devon it would be  better to 
sell it to someone who does, since the lights for those have to be  rather hard 
to get.  Plus that particular bulb may not be an easy to buy  item anymore!  
Then either pick up lighting from a later 12  volt Westie or any RV supply 
shop.  If you want something more  directional then take a look at LED lights.
  Florescent tubes work at hundreds of volts with very low  amps.  So the 
ballast is the key what the lighting  fixture will need as a supply voltage.
