&gt;The &quot;all's well&quot; 12:00 position is correct if the gauges are mounted 
&gt;one above the other, for the same reasons.

Is there a preferred position if you only have one gauge?  Just curious.

&gt;I'm in an ergonomics course this semester, and this is supposedly how 
&gt;they orient all the gauges in them nuclear power plants.  

Have they shown you the picture of the nuke plant control room with
beer tap handles on the control levers yet?  (Reference the book,
&quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;.)  I think the problem was that
there were a number of identical control levers next to one another
that had to be operated while watching a gauge reading elsewhere.
However, to get the right lever, you had to look away from the
gauge.  The plant operators put three different beer tap handles
on the levers so they could tell them apart by feel.

VW content: The change of the oil light from green to red is
probably an ergonomic issue.  Some people may have been interpreting
green as an &quot;OK&quot; sign, instead of the way it was meant - that ANY
warning light on in the speedo was an unusual condition and may
require attention.  (Yes, even the high beam light).

&gt;And that's why you have the gauges in the first place, no?

What?  I know a guy with an Acura with backwards wheels and a
big exhaust pipe, and he says the gauges added more HP than
the pipe!!

&gt;Try it, and see what works best for you.

I would, if I had any gauges.  So far I haven't run the engine
long enough for gauges to be useful... and right now I have to
put it back together even before I start it...where ARE my d_at_ng
heater boxes..!!?!
