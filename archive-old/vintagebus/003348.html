No where in Johns post did he infer that you did not know what you are
talking about, he replied with what would be the normal procedure given a
post like your first one. Outer bearings are often replaced in an attempt to
eliminate slop in the rear axles, and the inner ones are ignored because
they are harder to get to. Had you mentioned that you were replacing the
bearing because the cage had disentegrated, it would have been treated  as
an informational post, but for lack of any information to the contrary, it
appeared that you were trying to solve the slop problem by only replacing
the outer bearing and were blaming the bearing when it did not work. I am
sure we will all think twice before attempting to help now, lest we insult
someone.

&gt; I got a little 'hostile' because I was trying to let people know that a
&gt; Bower 211 501 283 is a piece of crap but John seemed to think I didn't
know
&gt; what I was talking about.
