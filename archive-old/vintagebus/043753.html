&gt;lube stud and upper bolt generously with grease, and install new shock. 

Make sure you get the nut on the upper bolt all the way down!  Whoever
last changed the shocks on my Bus didn't do this - the nut was only on
about half way.  This let the top of the shock flop around which beat
up the exposed threads on the bolt and pounded the hole in the horn a
little.  I replaced the nuts and bolts with ones from a junk yard and
it was much better.  The threads on the bolt just stop, so when you
turn the nut down that far it is very obvious - it WILL NOT turn any
further!  When you're done, you should be able to sit outboard of the 
tire, reach over the tire and grab the shock, and not be able to pull
it towards or away from you (other than the slight axial give in the
rubber bushings).

A good tip from Craig K's steering box how-to is to have a short
piece of 4x4 or similar around if you are going to be laying under
the Bus.  Put your head on the board like a pillow and your neck
doesn't hurt as much afterwards.
