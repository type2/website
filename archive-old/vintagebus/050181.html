Subject: Buses at the Beach &amp; VWs by the Seaside, Jacksonville FL

OK, so most folks are discussing Kelly Park and EveryBus, but how about
other events this weekend?  My wife and I are flying to Orlando on Saturday
to purchase a '79 vert, then we'll drive back to Minnesota after the
obligatory DisneyWorld visit.

I noticed in the new VW Trends that there is an event this weekend in
Jacksonville.  I'm sure we can detour to Jacksonville on our way north, but
will it be worth it?

I've got the website address (http://www.sevwc_dot_com ), but would love to
read some firsthand reports.  Has anyone attended this event?  What's it
all about?  Just a show?  Is there a good swap meet?  Wet tee/swimsuit
contest?  Races?

Any info appreciated.
