Subject: muffler treatment

I just bought a new muffler and I was wondering if I should treat it with a
high temp paint or some other coating.  I've read in a recent post about the
paint Eastwood offers for about 20 bucks.  This muffler cost 38 bucks and I
don't know how much to put into it before it becomes impractical.  How long
does a treated muffler last?  I can bead blast the existing black paint and
apply some tougher coating to the bare metal.  My question is 1) what
coatings are available for mufflers and 2) how much should I put into this
new coating?  Thanx for the advice.
