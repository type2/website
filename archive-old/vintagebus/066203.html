Subject: Re: [VB] trying to find Will Wood

I agree, he just up and left one day.  I have no idea why.

I am kind of surprised no one keeps in touch with him..?  From what I could 
gather he had loads of busses and really knew his stuff.

My main reason for trying to find him was to potentially get a German 009 
recurved to a 019 spec all in at 2300-2500.  Long story.  The 009 all in at 
3800 is impossible for a bus, as we all know.

Thanks,
Adrian

&gt;I sold him the 54 kombi a few years ago.   Last I heard from him is he made
&gt;it home.

&gt;&lt;&lt; Is that the guy in Idaho or some such, with bazillions of busses

&gt;the
&gt;  weeds down?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;  He just seemed to up and disappear one day.
