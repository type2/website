&gt; &gt; Not really; sounds just like me a couple of days ago. After a good day,
&gt; &gt; great day when I worked on my bus I sat in it and day dreamed about
driving
&gt; &gt; my bus. It's not that distant at all. Someone, here Karl told me to look
at
&gt; &gt; the Zits cartoon in Sunday's paper. So I went out and got it and I
looked. I
&gt; &gt; think everyone here should take a look at it too since I'm pretty sure
&gt; &gt; everyone did the same in their bus at one point or another.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;     Morning...
&gt;
&gt;     I have been following the adventures of those two kids and their
Splittie
&gt; for the better part of the last 2 years..  Recently I bought a house and
moved,
&gt; I discontinued the newspaper when I did and haven't seen a newspaper in 2
&gt; months...
&gt;
&gt;     Is there anyway you can scan the comic and e-mail it to me...??
&gt;
&gt;     I have about 12 of the strips pertaining to the initial purchase/
rescue of
&gt; the Bus and
&gt;
&gt;     and subsequent adventures.
&gt;
&gt;     I wonder if that comic strip is posted anywhere on the Net...
