Subject: Re: [VB] Saving drivetrain on downhills [Was: rev limiting rotor offshoot]

[..]

As usual there's a flip-side to everything.  Consider...

In mountainous country, especially in the West with miles-long very steep
downgrades, the primary concern is maintaining control of the vehicle.  If
you can't slow down for the hairpin curve, or the stop sign/light at the
bottom of the hill, minimizing wear and tear on the drivetrain instantly
becomes a secondary consideration.  Very distantly secondary.

Non-standard/creative braking arrangements aside [dragging feet through
holes in the floor, throwing out large anchors, etc.], a bus has 2
functional means of restraining its progress.

Engine/drivetrain braking is inadequate to stop the rig on a hill, but will
greatly assist in maintaining control of the rate of travel.

Brakes can stop the bus if they're reasonably functional, and can also
assist in maintaining control of the rate of travel, but they have a major
and potentially very serious shortcoming.  They can become overheated
because they can't shed heat fast enough to keep up with the heat generated
by the braking process.

When brakes reach a certain level of overheating they will &quot;fade&quot;, and at
that point the brakes instantly cease to function.  If you're strong enough
[and stark panic generates inordinate amounts of strength] you
could fold the brake pedal arm down through the floor, or even break it off
under the pressure, but there will be no effect at the drums/wheels.
Yanking on the emergency brake lever won't make any difference on your bus,
because it uses the same shoes as the rear service brakes.  Braking function
will not return until the drums/shoes/etc. have cooled down, and that won't
happen until you stop and park the rig, except you can't stop to cool the
brakes because you have no functional brakes, because.....

Now  -  visualize yourself descending that long mountain grade, controlling
speed with the brakes to save wear and tear on the drivetrain, and just as
you see the sign for the switchback the brakes fade.  You frantically start
stuffing gears, praying that somehow you can dump enough vehicle speed to
get through the hairpin corner unscathed.  If your transaxle is in decent
shape you'll probably get into a gear, but it may not be the gear you so
desperately need.  For the sake of the illustration we'll assume you get the
gear needed and make it through the corner OK and safely up a runaway
lane/road/trail where you can park [don't count on the emergency/parking
brake] and let the brakes cool back down while you duck in the brush to
change your underwear.

So what's the secret here?  Follow the lead of your friends the truckers,
persons similarly blessed with top-heavy, inadequately-braked vehicles.
They know all about brake fade and runaway lanes/roads/trails, and have
learned the lessons the hard [and expensive] way.  In many locales truckers
are required by law to gear down before descending steep grades [sometimes
even the gear to be used is specified], stop and test their brakes before
descending, or both.  We commonly think of our Type 2s as trucks.  The
proportions are different, but the principles and problems are the same.

Use drivetrain/engine braking to control bus speed on long and/or steep
grades, saving the brakes as much as possible for occasions when the brakes
absolutely MUST work properly.

It doesn't take long to sort out a balanced approach, erring on the safe
side if there's any doubt.  Drive and think ahead of your location/position,
maintaining a reserve of slowing/stopping capability for unforeseen
contingencies [blocking accident, deer in the road, the dreaded falling
rocks].

Certainly, brake shoes/pads are cheaper than transaxles or engines, but a
decent funeral costs more than the whole bus!

&gt;&gt;  I had done the same, using the motor to slow the bus down, then someone
reminded me that changing a motor or tranny (well that's where the wear
goes)
is pricier than worn brake shoes, and more work to boot, and I use my brakes
more now, being a cheap bus person.  &lt;&lt;
