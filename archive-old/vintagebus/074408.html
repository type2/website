Subject: I'm excited!!!

        I just got back from Yuma, AZ where master engine-builder, Jim 
Burnite, with assistance from his son, Jeremy, just finished assembling and 
test-running the new engine for my '61 double cab.  It's basically a 'zero 
mile' motor with new: mag. alloy case (no AL headaches for me)(full flowed), 
74mm crank, Scat C-25 cam/lifters, CB chromoly rods, 90.5mm 
pistons/cylinders, semi-hemi cut 043 heads (6.9 CR), solid rocker shafts 
w/swivel foot adjusters, oil pump w/ Berg relief cover.  In addition, it's 
running a pair of the DP Kadron carbs, 009 dizzy, 8-doweled flywheel, type-3 
oil cooler (for now), and stock generator and stock fuel pump.

       When it was ready to run, we fired it up for break-in and tuning.  
Cool!  Once Jim got it all dialed in, it seemed to have so much torque that 
just a small bump on the linkage almost made it jump off the bench!  

The one thing in the whole mix that was forgotten was an exhaust (we 
temporarily borrowed one of Jim's), but I'll get that taken care of this week 
and get the motor into the truck.  I'm so anxious for that first test drive I 
can't stand it.  My DC has missed the last 3 Jerome Jamborees due to one 
mechanical problem or another.  That's pretty pathetic for the Pres. of the 
ABC to not have a bus at Jerome.  This year will be different, though.  

Now, if I could just do something about that darm dead Vanagon..........

Anyway, sorry if I bored any of you, but I just had to tell!!!!!
