Hi all-

I have a pretty significant oil leak comming from between the number 3
cylinder and the case.  What type of liquid gasket material should I use
to solve the problem?

Aloha Gerald,

Could you please tell a little more of the history of your engine? Year,
size, miles, is it rebuilt and who rebuild it etc.?
