Was there ever an intended use for this space? We have all probably found uses at one time or another, but what was VW's reason for shaping the floor of this place the way it is? What's with the circular indentation and the hole? The hole looks like it might be for bolting something down? Or drainage? Why did VW put it there? Does something fit there?
