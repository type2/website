Subject: Classic 2000 pics up
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 143.182.246.21

I finally got off my ___ and posted some pics from the Classic 2000 weekend
on my web site.  There are &gt;150 photos.  No owner's names to protect the
innocent.

I would like to know who owns the '59 Binz that was at the Classic.

A few people said they would also email me some photos they had taken.  You
may proceed.  Thanks in advance!
