&gt; I believe that it's 15-20 seconds, not minutes! Yes, I did that a while

just checked.  it says a &quot;full minute&quot;.

it also says that:
 a) a broken ring will make the same sound, except constantly 
	(which sounds like it could be your problem?)

 b) that loose heads will make a louder pounding sound (although this 
        hasn't been the case in my experience)

(sorry to regurgitate Muir, but it seemed like it might have some use)

&gt; I think that I'm just gonna have to take the engine apart to the case, and
&gt; pull on those conn rods, check their clearances, and decide whether to
&gt; knock it all apart. 

good call.  before you pull the heads though, you might try torquing them 
to spec to see if any are completely loose.  &quot;Why not?&quot;

&gt; After 75,000 miles, as one other said here, it's
&gt; prolly about time. 

perhaps. but if everything else is w/i spec (bearings, endplay, heads, 
compression) then you don't necessarily need to waste a good case.

&gt; Gene Berg, bless his long-gone heart, advises not to
&gt; rebuild an old case. I called them, they're still selling the magnesium
&gt; alloy cases, they won't have anything to do with aluminum ones, she said.
&gt; $475 for the dual PR 1970-type case. Price is not too much more than 1993,
&gt; last time I bought one (this present engine).

FWIW, I bought a new Magnesium case a couple of months ago for $300 here:

Good luck!
