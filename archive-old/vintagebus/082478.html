Subject: 21 Window Wiring Harness Removal Problem

21 Window Wiring Harness Removal Problem:

I got all the wiring removed and left certain peices here and there for
fishing later on but when trying to pull the main harness (running to the
back) something it catching.

I checked to see if anything else was still connected and there isn't.

I think maybe the wiring bunched up tightly and is stuck in the frame rail.  I
have only a small amount of wiring left on one end and it wont budge that way
either.

Anyone have any suggestions or am I going to have to cut the side belly pan
and stuff off just to get this cluster ^&amp;*# out?

Thanks.

Dan Howard
