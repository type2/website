~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Snippets ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Yep, you found a ceramic power resistor.
'You can check the resistor you have with an ohm-meter, self-powered test 
light, or test/timing light.
'You could also forget the resistor and restore the Bus to 6 V, but don't 
listen to me.  I'm a freak.  :)

Thanks Matt,

As always, you give good answers and advice all at the same time.  I 
appreciate it.

BTW... I agree, why mess with the originally designed power system?  When 
the time is available, I think I will take my '63 back to 6V.  Its just 
cooler that way.
