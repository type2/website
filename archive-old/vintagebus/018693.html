Only 3&quot;?  From what I've seen (alt.building.construction) you'd want
a miniumum of 4&quot;, more if you're going to have heavy stuff.  I also
don't see how you can get away without using rebar, unless you're
doing it in sections.   One guy I know who built a dream shop did 9&quot; 
but he has a lift and other toys.

I've been doing similar research myself in preparation for building
a new garage/shop.

Oh, and you don't &quot;pour&quot; concrete - you &quot;place&quot; it.

&gt; one have advise about pouring concrete garage floors?
