Subject: '54 update + Oil Pressure and Rear Axle Qs

Decided to put the '54 Single Cab into service before I rip it apart
to switch it back to a Bus rear end.  Hooked up my tachometer, oil
temperature, and oil pressure gauges in a nice panel on the dash. :)
Installed new engine seals.  Installed previously missing 40hp rear
engine tin.  Installed new fuel lines everywhere.  Adjusted
carburetor. Came up with the following questions:

1.  With new 20/50 oil, the oil pressure was 50 psi cold but dropped
to 4 psi at idle (875 rpms and yes, the oil light came on) and 19 psi
at 2500 rpms after a 15-minute, 60-65 mph freeway drive in windy 100
degree heat.  Oil temperature showed about 190 degrees and quickly
dropped to 180 on city streets.  I pulled out the single relief valve
and spring, everything looked clean and spring looked good (This
doesn't affect the pressure on a single relief case anyway, does it?).
What could be the cause of the low pressure?  I noticed the oil pump
cover plate leaks a tiny bit, 2 drops after the drive.  Time for a new
oil pump?  I'd be worried but the oil temperature seems good, I just
drove it back from California, and the PO was driving it like this for
around 1 year, including a few 500-mile trips.  Oh yeah, and the end
play seems a bit large...  This almost sounds like a joke, is this
engine totally worn out and about to blow up?!?

2. For the oil temperature, I used a sump plate sender.  It seemed
like the top of the sender may be touching the oil screen, would this
cause an inaccurate reading?

3. If I want to completely remove the rear axles from the
transmission, including brakes, axle tubes, etc., do I need to
dismantle the reduction boxes in any way?  Assume a '63 rear end.


Thank you,
