Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing tires.

That's exactly the same machine they used on the rims today and 1.5 years
ago.

On a normal rim the cone has a full circle to seal on versus the five points
and less of a surafce area for this contact. If one or more of the five
points is just marginally off I am suspecting an imbalance will occur even
if the rim itself is straight. If the rim is bolted to the drum the points
flatten to the drum surface and all should be right.

The machine on one rim was suggesting 6.5 ounces one side/3.5 ounces the
other. A little lower on the second rim but not much..... Again these were
rims that were restored by this same company, deemed absolutely fine, and
balanced OK.

In talking to a retired VW mechanic tonight his recollection is the old VW
adapter used by the dealer apparently connected to the rim bolt holes for
balancing.

Scott

&gt; store do the tire install. They had an adapter that consisted of a flat
&gt; plate that my wheel butted up against and on the outside, a cone was spun
&gt; down on the 5 rounds that extend toward the center from the bolt holes. A
&gt; small flat was produced and the paint was slightly dinged on the tip of
each
&gt; round.
