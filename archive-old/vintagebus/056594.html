&gt;Kevin, funny you should mention a 6V bug heater, that is what I am working
&gt;on today, along with Bryant's duel carbs on his bus, I am building a bug
&gt;heater for Matthew's bus that was 6V but with the connection of just 2 wires
&gt;turns it into a 12V.

I've been waiting for someone else to jump in on this one, but they haven't, so,
OK, then- which two wires get connected to turn a 6V into a 12 V?
