&gt; ^$_at_#%^%%%$.  I bet the throwout arm broke.  (thanks clara!:p )   Just
&gt; what I wanted again. (for those that don't remember, I had one break years
&gt; ago on my '69...I had a friend's dad repair it at his machine shop. just
&gt; replaced the whole broken arm..)
&gt; 

Hello Guys    The biggest reason for broken crosshaft arms is the TOB falling 
off. What we do is to use the super clips that have a circle on the outside 
and use wire tyes to attach them to the crosshaft,   Also Talking about the VB 
list I don,t ever see any of my posts so I really don't have any idea if 
everybody gets them or not  Later and have fun  mark Dearing
