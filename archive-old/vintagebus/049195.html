Susan:

Glasurit paint is what you need, IMHO.  (800)325-8000 is the toll free Glasurit number where they can give you the authorized dealer nearest you.

How much you need depends on whether you're going to paint the inside of the bus or not.  Is your bus two-tone?  I ended up  getting one gallon of each color for my bus.  A few areas needed to be resprayed, plus I wanted to have some paint left over for the future. 

Robert
