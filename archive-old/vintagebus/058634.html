&gt;
&gt;I don't know how many people on this list are in or around Dallas, I know 
&gt;of at least one, whom I have never met, but I saw a small story in the 
&gt;newspaper about a get together of &quot;pre-1967 enthusiasts&quot; at the Dream Cafe, 
&gt;2:30 Sunday.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody here know of this? I'm going to go there. See you there?
