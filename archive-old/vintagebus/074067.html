Subject: Re: [T2] 17 mm bolt

&gt;Where would be a good place to shop for such a size bolt?
&gt;If the head is a 17mm, how do I size the bolt?  A 17 mm???

Lowe's, Home Despot, Ace Hardware, any Mom and Pop hardware store (I prefer 
them best), look in the Yellow pages for nuts and bolts, etc.

Bolts will be listed by the length of the threaded portion, pitch of the 
threads, and their strength.

The head size (the size of the wrench used to tighten and loosen) is 
irrelevant.

Your bumpers are probably held on by M8x1.5 bolts (8mm diameter and 1.5mm 
thread pitch) and the length is probably 20mm. 20 mm from under the head to 
the end. The length isn't important as long as the bolt goes through the 
item being held and engages all of the threads in the hole. You of course 
don't want it to bottom out either but with your bumpers it doesn't matter.

Because strength isn't a big deal here (bumper is light, not safety related 
like steering, brakes and suspension - it could fall off and you could 
still make it home safely) I'd use stainless bolts and washers to slow the 
corrosion process.

Good luck.
