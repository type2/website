Subject: Re: [VB] gear oil

[...]

Recently saw a G.I Joe's ad for old reliable Sta-Lube GL-4 on sale.  As I recall it was around $6.00/gallon, and they threw in the Sta-Lube pump for free...

==================================

&gt;If the Mobile synthetic GL5 uses phosphorus and sulfur compounds to get 
&gt;the GL5 rating, then it will be just as bad for your synchronizers as 
&gt;regular GL5. GL numbers have to do with the pressure rating of the oil. 
&gt;Redline makes a synthetic GL4. Look for MT-90 under the products pull
&gt;down.
