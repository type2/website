&lt;&lt;  We are starting to get a little noise in the rear when the clutch is in, 
probably the throwout bearing, (maybe worse?).  We think we will get it home 
ok, just a little noise occasionally.  We will need to make about 400 miles 
to get home.  Any estimates of life expectancy from this condition? &gt;&gt;
Hi Phillip &amp; Catherine,
Hate to say it,but you could have ten miles or another ten thousand left in 
it.  Best you try not to use the clutch pedal for the least amount of time at 
any stoplights (Even during normal driving this is wise!), and read up on how 
to drive you VW without a clutch in the Idiot's manual by John Muir.  Then on 
quite parts (Little traffic during daylight.) of your drive you can practice 
this method to get the hang of it before you lose you clutch now or someday.  
 

&lt;&lt;We were wondering if you could recommend a good parts source here in Las
Vegas where we could get a throw out bearing just in case???   We have 
emailed the local AIRS folks also.&gt;&gt;
Get the throwout arm (Make sure the shaft is firmly welded to the arms by a 
bead of weld on each!), bushing kit, throwout bearing, retaining clips for 
the bearing, clutch disc, pressure plate, and just for the heck of it if you 
do not have them already the clutch cable with the rear end adjusting nut, 
and a new clip for the forward end of the clutch cable.
