  I think all should have the splash pan  up front as dworkin stated ,and as 
 for the belly pas ( support pans under the cargo area floors ,,) its not 
 limited to Deluxes and Double Doors, it applies also to Standard Sunroof 
 buses, (ie the 56 sunroof on the web pages had them ,,yea the one with the 
 jungle jim looking braces inside it )  and alot of the westies had  but that 
 might have been the bays with the big hole in the roof ,,Later

ya- think some years on bay westy pop tops were made on sunroof combis- which 
had the sub floor pans like any other sunroof bus or DD.   which is why there 
is that extra slot between layers of metal by the pop top you can store junk 
in- it is something to do with the sliding roof set up.     the non sun roof 
deluxes did not get them.   no clue if late ( 74+) bay westys had them- 
someone told me they did not
