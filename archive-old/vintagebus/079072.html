Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

The first pressure plate I did not know the ID of as it came with the
engine, however this one is a stock 215mm late bus plate.  I was told that
even a 1700lb Kennedy shouldn't need a lot more effort as mine does compared
to friends buses?

&gt; Paul,
&gt; The pressure plates vary as to which one you have.
&gt; Our stock is soft but our Kennedy 1700 lb. requires MORE effort.
&gt; Sounds as if you do not know what pressure you have???
&gt; Now to I.D. you pressure plate?
&gt; P &amp; C
&gt; Still in the PNW

&gt; &gt; I have a 66 split bus that I fitted IRS to 18 months ago using a type 3

&gt; &gt; It had its original box, but with a 1200 engine in with a 180mm clutch -
which
&gt; &gt; I don't remember being that difficult to use.
&gt; &gt; I then fitted a 1600 that had sat outside for a while, and the pressure
plate
&gt; &gt; was a bit rusty - the clutch was tough to engage - but I just put that
down to
&gt; &gt; the fact that then PP was rusty.
&gt; &gt; Now I have just fitted a type 4 engine with a brand new 215mm pressure
plate -
&gt; &gt; and the clutch is still just as difficult to engage.....
