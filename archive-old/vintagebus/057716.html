Subject: Re: [VB] Balljoint beam conversion question

Rex,
IF it is wider, it is so little, that I can't see any difference.  I'm running
with the 14&quot; wheels and 205 tires and have ZERO rubbing problems.  I didn't know
that it was an issue and neglected to measure the outside tire to tire
distance.  Which brings up a point that for an accurate measurement, I guess I'd
have to pull off the wheels and measure from somewhere other than the tires.

&gt; Is it wider from wheel to wheel? If so, how much?
