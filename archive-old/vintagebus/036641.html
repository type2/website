Hi,

	Someone on the list was looking for the Tent mounting pieces for the
Bus a couple months back.

	We exchanged e-mails, but deteremined that I didn't have what you
were looking for.

	The parts were the ones the attached to the Bus. THe piece accepts
the larger diameter Pole. or somethying like that.

	I forget who exactly it was.
	If it was you, e-mail me and I think I have a contact for you that
might have what you were looking for.

	THANKS
