Subject: Heater tube on a '65 bus

My bus doesn't have any heat. The guy that sold it to me warned me about it but I guess I wanted it
so bad, I didn't care.

Anyway, now that I have the engine out I can see why. There aren't any heater tubes connecting the
heater boxes to the bus. I searched the archives and saw something about some little mufflers that
were supposed to be there so I went to the junk yard and got some mufflers (they look like big hot
dogs) and some short slinkly looking metal pipes that connect from the heater boxes to the mufflers.

That didn't work. The muffler opening is smaller than the opening of the heater ducts on the bus and
the slinky pipes are smaller than the heater box outlet holes.

I'm stumped. Can anybody tell me or point me to a picture of what I need?

Kevin Bell
