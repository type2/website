Subject: 12 volt BN4 heater 

Hi all,

I purchased a 12 volt (67 bus only?) Eberspacher BN4 heater at the OCTO meet
last weekend that had everything except for the switch.  Yesterday, I
noticed on the Samba that the same seller had a switch for sale.  It was
listed as a pre 67 switch (6 v.?) I emailed him &amp; asked if it would work on
the unit he sold me.  He thought it might, w/ only the light needing to be
changed to 12 v.

Does anyone know whether this is correct or not &amp; what's a reasonable cost
for this switch, how hard are they to come by, etc?


TIA

Tom Buese
