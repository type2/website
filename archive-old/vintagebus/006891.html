from
Europe somewhere.. Ron??

&lt;&lt; Awesome. I think now I recall a past thread maybe?
 about someone who wanted to know where to cut the air
 ducts for the fans.  Are these more rare that split
 setups? &gt;&gt;

    They aren't cut, they mount inside the vent, the only hole is the one
for

the wiring to pass thru, I know they use a 2 spd fan with a switch on the 
dash. How rare they are I don't know
Chuck
