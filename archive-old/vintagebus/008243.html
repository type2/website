I still remember the article I read in VW Trends a few months ago about how
fast all these pats become obsolete. Someone was looking for a bumper for
their Rabbit and the only place they could find one was at a junk yard
(meaning used). VW is not the only one on this. I was looking for parts for
1993 Lincoln Mark VIII and to my obvious disbelief found out that there are
parts on the list already obsolete. I asked the &quot;counter boy&quot; if he can tell
me where I would find them then so he just replied &quot;Nowhere&quot;. But! I found a
shop that had them fresh, brand new, not original, not stamped with part
numbers but still good. What's the problem? Older than 5 years are suppose
to die slowly? be replaced with new ones? heck, someone has to buy all those
ridiculously priced cars..............


crazy world........
keep 'em running.
