Subject: Help with part #'s on my '59's engine

I need some help with a few engine parts. In particular, my distributor.
I've got a '59 Kombi with engine #AJ 065 869, which I think makes it a '75
bug engine.

My distributor is a Bosch &amp; is marked:
JUR4 &lt;-
0 231 137 017
311 905 205G
I can't seem to find this # anywhere. What points should I use with it?
Anyone got info on it?

My Bosch generator is marked:
0 101 302 111 - 112
G&lt;-14v 30A 20
113903031P
It's bad &amp; I'll need a new one of those. I assume there's nothing special
about this one. Any info on the cheapest place to get a new Bosch generator
&amp; voltage regulator would be great.
