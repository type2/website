Subject: Selling my 67 Deluxe

I am going to sell my 67 Deluxe. It is not running, but is in good shape. I
tried earlier to sell it for $1k, but now will settle for $750. It needs to
be trailered when you pick it up. I have pictures available. I need the
money more than I need the bus, and I don't want to take it to the dump,
because I know someone can get it going, but it won't be me. Pmail for more
information.
