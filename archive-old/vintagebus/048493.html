Subject: Micrometer Calibration

In one of my previous jobs, I was working with etching
thin stainless steel to very precise shapes.  We were having
some problems, and I got elected to do a series of
measurement of various locations of each piece through
the process.  I was using a micrometer that read to
.00001 inches.  After repeated use, the mic would get
warmer by being in my hand and start providing invalid
data.  I needed a standard to which I could check my
measurements against.  I whipped out my trusty set of
thickness guages from my VW and took them to the lab
for calibration.  Guess what?  The various thicknesses
on mine &amp; your set are very, very accurate.  Well within
any requirements that would be needed.

This only means that you can use your shim set as a
standard for measuring items in the range of your
shim set.  If anyone could find a commonly available
object, measure it with a calibrated mic, and pass it
along to the list, we would all have something to use
as a standard.
