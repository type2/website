Hey guys and gals,

It's been so long since I've driven a VW with a stock speedo that I forgot which light is
which on it. Now before you say the red light is this and the green light is this, my
speedo is so old that the lights are faded and I don't know which one is which. I went out
driving today and the light on the left came on, but I don't know which one is which :-)

thanks
matt
