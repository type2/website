Nice to hear about your bus Jeremy.  I too am thrilled with my bus and I
haven't got it into town yet to work on it!  I had all the same concerns and
questions as you do about whether or not to convert to IRS, whether or not
to lower the bus, and all of that.  My decision, which is the result of
asking a lot of questions to the list members as well as the experience
gained by working hands-on on my VWs is to leave the bus stock (suspension
and drive wise.)

This may seem like a shock but there are many added advantages.

First of all, when you convert a bus to IRS, you inherently lower the rear
end which requires an adjustable beam up front to keep the bus level.  Then,
since you've converted to a bug trans, you need a bit more HP to pull the
bus along at the same speeds.  If you plan on hauling any amount of weight,
may the Lord help you because the bug trans was never meant to pull the
weight of a bus plus cargo.  Also, by converting a bus to IRS, you do what
&quot;everyone else&quot; wants to do with the bus.  Don't conform, be your own
person, do it differently and leave it alone!  The bus was meant to have
extra clearance anyway because when you load it down it's gonna go down
whether you like it or not.  Just imagine the fishing holes, driveways, and
speed bumps that will all cause problems if you lower your bus.  I doubt
that any of us drive 100% of the time and live %100 of the time on highways.
I guess if you live on the shoulder of a highway, lowering is okay.

Granted, it may not be the cheapest thing to spend $300 on new bearings for
the redux boxes but I've been scrimping and saving money for my bus and have
a good used 1600DP which will get 1.25 ratio rockers and dual 34ICT carbs to
help push the bus along.  I also have a bus tranny with the 3.88 gearing
(late Super gearing) but with the redux bearings, I'll have a little bit
lower gearing which the 1600DP should handle just fine.

I've found that when you go tinkering with the VW design, it inherently
causes so many other needless problems, that you come to appreciate the
wisdom and engineering that went into the stock design of these machines.
You have to work on them to understand what I mean.  It has to do with ease
of repairs and availability of replacement parts but unless you've BTDT, you
just won't understand.

I DARE you Jeremy, yes DARE you to keep it stock.  You'll come to appreciate
just how well built a stock bus is and although it isn't as cheap to repair
a bus as it is a bug, you're gonna love driving your baby around town when
you're done, knowing it's done right.  Plus you'll have an intimate
knowledge of all your bus's working parts and you'll amaze friends, family,
and the ladies when you can fix things in 2 shakes of a valve adjustment and
be on your way.
