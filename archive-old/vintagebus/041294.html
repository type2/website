Subject: WTB: a split screen bus in the Portland, OR area

I'm looking for a split screen bus in the Portland, OR area.
  
I would prefer something that is running, but would consider a
non-running bus for the right price. I'm looking for something
with a relatively clean body. If anyone has any leads, let me
know, as I haven't been able to find anything good in the local    
classifieds.
