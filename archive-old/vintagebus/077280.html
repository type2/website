Subject: Wide 5 front beam offering

hello fellow bus pilots. When I bought Butch I got a front beam end to
end with it. It's a wide 5 drum beam which I guess means it's from a
68-70 bay window. I was debating putting this on my split for a while
but decided not to. I have not run it on a bus, but it seems very
tight. all the ball joints do not seem to have slop. 

I'd &quot;like&quot; to trade it for any split camper parts, as I have a bay
interior in the split now. But to be quite honest, If it will get a
bus back on the road It's yours for the price of a beer :)

It's located in Mid TN in Dickson. It's damn heavy so shipping really
wouldn't be a good idea. pmail me if anyone is interested.
