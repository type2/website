Subject: That orange double slider door Deluxe...

Hi all,

In 1999 the owner of this very original Bus, a nice guy named Ben, was one of
5 or 6 Split Busses and their owners from the Split Screen Van Club in England
who picked all of the arriving participants on the Der Kafer Fahrer Club's
&quot;Return to the Fatherland Tour '99&quot; from the airports at Gatwick and Heathrow.
David Eccles arranged this Vintage transportation for us (most of 'em cut work
to do it), and these folks scooped us up from the airports on a beautiful
sunny day and took us around the outer motorway ring of London and then east
to the coast at Harwich, where the three 53' containers with the nine RTTFT
cars inside had been freshly off-loaded from their trans Atlantic container
ship journey.  Most of us were pretty groggy from the over-night flights, but
I and two others were loaded into that double-slider Deluxe for the trip with
Ben.  I sat up front with him, and stayed awake and enjoyed the ride and the
conversation.  As I remember it, the Bus was used on the ramp at the Geneva,
Switzerland Airport for many years.  I think he said he still had the
mega-rare middle seat for it, but it was not in the Bus that day as I recall
(our luggage and tools were).  I remember it being stock height at the time
and it rode fine!  I don't remember Ben mentioning the low gearing option...
Anyway, the Brits safely delivered all of us to our Bed &amp; Breakfast/pub on the
coast and treated us to our first (of many) pints.  Great guys to lend us
Yanks a hand, and a lot of fun to party with!  Bitchen' Bus, mega rare!

The RTTF Tour eventually ended up in Bad Camberg in 1999 and as I remember Ben
was there with the Bus.  What a great time that was!  I hope a devout Vintage
Bus enthusiast gets it and takes good care of it!

Bill Bowman
