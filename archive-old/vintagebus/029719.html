Hey list,
I picked up a set of NOS 77 mm 36hp pistons/cylinders this weekend.  They
are not boxed and were stored sealed and submersed in oil for many years
in a guys back yard.  I was just wondering if there is any way to determine
the manufacturer.  There is a marking on the piston face, it might be an
M for Mahle?

Anyway, let me know, thanks.
