Subject: Need fog light bulbs
Message-Id: &lt;199907101127136_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know of a source for fog light bulbs?  I need both 6V and 12V.

One style I need looks similar to a dual filament tail light bulb at the base, but has a flat ring around it (like Saturn) with three bayonet connector type of holes.  This one says Asahi (I think they made my camera too) and is labeled as a 6V/35/35W.  I think it has two 35 watt filiments.  I saw a similar bulb in some turn signals butchered onto one of my buses and it was labeled as a Mazda bulb.  Did the Japannese make 6V fog lamps?  

The other type is used in two different styles of Bosch lights I bought.  They look like single filiment turn signal bulbs, except twice the size.  They have metal tabs, rather than the standard round nubs to align them.  The ones I have are 6V 35W, but I would like to have both 6V and 12V if I can find them. 

If anyone knows of a place that carries these, or can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Richard
