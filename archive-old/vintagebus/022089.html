Subject: NEATO page back up
Mime-Version: 1.0

Even though I vowed I would keep the NEATO page down until Old Bus Review 
got caught up, I caved and put it back on line.  (I just got tired of all 
the emails asking how long it would be down)

Just so you know, I do all the maintenance to the site as well as pay for 
everything out of my pocket.  Anyone sending angry emails demanding the 
site be put back up simply got added to my kill-file.

I put info about Old Bus Review #60 on the site, but that is all I have 
updated so far.  I will try to get everything else updated next week.
