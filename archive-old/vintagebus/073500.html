Subject: [VB] Road music or not (early friday question)

Pinchi gringos, just can't appreciate some good ranchero music....just think what the mojados are saying about Nsync or the Backdoor Boyz...

Now here's a question for you bus folks.....kinda like the parcel tray content question....what tunes do you have in your bus right now?

I've got the following CD's...most mine, but a few for the wife and girls other than CD's, it's AM talk radio (shit I'm getting old):

Robert Earl Keen-Gringo Honeymoon
Robert Earl Keen-Live Dinner #2
Robert Earl Keen-Walking Distance
Robert Earl Keen-Gravitational Forces (I think I like this guy )
Coldplay-the new one
Gary P. Nunn - greatest hits
Willie Nelson - greatest hits
Robert Cray - Shame + a Sin
Robert Cray-some kind of essential hits thing
Jack Ingram - Hey You
Charlie Robison - Life of the Party
Sheryl Crow - the newest one
Los Palominos - some of that Messkin chit =)
Pete Yorn - new one
John Mayer - don't know the name
Jimmy Buffet - Changes in Latitudes
Bach - compilation of sorts
Hank Williams III-cant remember the name

so that's whats taking up my space in my parcel tray.....any takers?

&gt; turned off the radio when I couldn't find a station in English, back to AM
