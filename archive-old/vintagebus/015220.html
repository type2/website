Andy,
        Yes they are still available.  I have them registered  on my '54 
oval, '56 single cab, and '58 356A.  The plates usually run between $30-50 
depending on condition and availablity.  There are two guys selling these 
plates.  I recommend calling the guy from Vero Beach.  He has a larger 
selection.  His number can be found in the Auto Trader.  Annual registration 
fee's I believe are $32.50.  Each year has a different designated color 
scheme which adds to the vintage look of your bus.  Way better than those 
cheap red &amp; white collectable plates everyone uses.  Good Luck!  Drive 'Em!
