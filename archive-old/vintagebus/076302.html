Subject: Fun with Barndoors !

 Dewd! - Damn - sounds nice - so did you find em in Winnipeg?  If so ...
where?  I remember seeing a couple of old buses on the East side of town in
a yard ... just off that road you take to Grand Beach (I've been gone from
Winnipeg for only 2 years and I forget street names already)  They were in a
yard ... hmmm - with some old out buildings.  They were back off the road a
bit.  I tried to approach that house a few times but ... it was kinda
unapproachable - is that the place?

 Did ya see pics of my 'new' Manitoba bus - and pics of my Manitoba
furniture collection?  www.johndillon_dot_com/john

 Good luck with the 'new' bus.
