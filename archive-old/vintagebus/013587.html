Quite possibly.  I had one last for a couple of years.  Depends on how
you run the engine, and local ambient temperatures.  At this time of
year, if you don't run at high RPMs, I'd say you should be fine.
Believe me, you'll know when it fails completely - you'll have real
jerky driving, like someone's hitting the brakes, and eventually
billowing white clouds of smoke out the back.  Even if yours never
gets that bad, you should plan on replacing the belt when you do the
bearings.  Inspect the pulley for excessive wear while you're at it.
