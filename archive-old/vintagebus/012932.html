They're something like $15 from Wolfsburg West.  I replaced both
in the '55 (and previously in the '56)

Where the originals had 2 separate part #'s, the new ones are one
part number for either, and are extra-long, so you have to cut them
down for your application.  I had to remove almost a foot for my
choke cable on the '55.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; We are looking for a 1955-61 choke cable including it's tubing for our 1960
&gt; panel camper.  We have found a ZVW accessory kit for converting the 40HP
&gt; engine to manual choke.  Since the 1641cc engine uses a simular style
&gt; caburator we want to see if we can make the kit work with this setup.
