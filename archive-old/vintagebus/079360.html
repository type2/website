Hi Audreyszabo,
Not safe, because the front seat then can come loose in an accident 
especailly when rear ended.  It also does adversely affect the structure of the bus 
body!  It does decrease the value, but a replacement piece can be easily welded 
back in place.  
  Hey, Rex does that 1960 panel you just found have the bulkhead?
