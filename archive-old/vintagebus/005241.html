not sure if my mail is getting thru to Dworking so i'm posting this to the
list sorry for any inconveince, used is the way to fly , the repops are a
pain , but as i say i get good ones and bad ones, used are about a peice of
cake to install minimal differences and just hav eto repair the damage from
cutting out, i'm putting a set in the 56 at this moment, and they fit great,
after installing i have to add the section to make the lip rite for it but
thats not really a biggie, well not to me anyway, the repos will do if you
can't get your hands on what you need and i just do what has to be done to
make them rite , and alot of times i'll eat some of the labor on that just
to be nice, not everyone does that, and i really shoudn't but i don't
believe in gouging.
On another note i just got a Miller 110volt spot welder and a Lincoln weld
pak 10 for the shop i'l post on how these work at a later date, i been
hiding this weekend for much needed rest , also my links page has been
updated, i posted it this am , if anyone sees links that should be there let
my nephew know , he is keeping that one up for me as a school project for a
grade , and your comments are welcome to us both ,,later time to open up ,
