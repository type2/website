--- Jason Elm &lt;jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; asked:
&gt; Is there a good adhesive dissolver that will leave
&gt; the paint alone?

Go to http://www.griotsgarage_dot_com and check out the 3M
adhesive remover they have.  You may be able to find
it at your FLAPS as well, maybe even Wal or K mart.  I
use it all the time and it works wonders on more than
adhesive.  It says it's hurt the paint, but I always
wash the area that I use it on and never have had a
problem.

Paul
