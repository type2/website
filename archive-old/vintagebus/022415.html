Subject: FREE cargo floor section - Sacramento
Mime-Version: 1.0

I feel bad taking it to the dump.  :)

It's the remaining center section of the underbelly of the '60 SC, and it's
the same as a bus cargo floor.  Like with the bed section a couple of weeks
ago, you HAVE to come get it.  I will *not* ship it, I will *not* deliver
it, I will not eat green eggs and ham.  If you ask me nicely, I'll help you
lift it into your bus.  If nobody wants it, at least I won't feel bad
taking it to the dump.  It's in Sacramento, btw.  Here's a pic:
