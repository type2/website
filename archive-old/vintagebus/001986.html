By the end of 1949, Volkswagen Director Heinz Nordhoff was offering an
impressive export line of Volkswagens to the eager European market. The
standard sedan model was joined by the beautiful, open four seater
cabriolet built by Karmann, and a Deluxe sedan outfitted with a sliding
cloth sunroof manufactured by the Golde firm. Nordhoff, however, was
anxious to push the Volkswagen into worldwide prominence and longed to
tap into the American automotive market.
