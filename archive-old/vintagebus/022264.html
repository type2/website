Interesting that the Volkswagen Club of Nebraska would be heading to Mt.
Rushmore the same day as their show!

&gt;
&gt;I'll be missing this years show in Springfield, Mo so everyone else will
have 
&gt;a chance at the swap meet this year 8-)  I'll be heading up to Mt. Rushmore 
&gt;with the Volkswagen Club of Nebraska.  The Rushmore trip sounds like a
blast. 
&gt; We will be stopping at Car Henge (A Nebraska farmers version of Stone
Henge) 
&gt;and a VW Salvage yard along the way.  There will be a few 36hp cars on the 
&gt;trip up there so I should be able to keep up.  This will be the first out of 
&gt;town trip in the Binz since I have owned it and installed the new engine.  
&gt;I'll be headed out tomorrow - Wish me well!
