&gt; 
&gt;  So how do you install front shocks??
&gt;  
&gt;  What tools are needed?
&gt;  
&gt;  I have a 66 splittie i want to install them on.
&gt;  
douse the upper and lower bolts with penetrating oil daily, while you order 
or 
you buy your nice new shiny KYB GR-2s

go unde rthe bus with you hat on, with a 17mm box wrench and also a socket on 
a ratchet.   loosen the upper- bolt and nut, and the lower- nut and stud.  
remove the upper bolt and the lower nut.   twist the shock and you end up 
pulling it off (big hammer helps) leaving the inner metal circle rusted 
securly onto the stud.

if it does not stick on there, get out, and jump around and yell and dance 
for joy.

get your angle grinder and ear and eye protection, and grind a flat area on 
one side of the metal tube.   use the big A vice grip to twist the tube off.  
   Since heat can mess up the temp of metal, it is probably not the best 
place to use heat, plus burning rubber reeks.    lube stud and upper bolt 
generously with grease, and install new shock. 

repeat on other side.

so, you need:

hat
17mm wrench
17mm socket
ratchet  
claw hammer and possibly bfh
penterating oil
grinder and ear&amp;eye protection - OR- raspy file for the luddites
Big A Vice Grips
grease
