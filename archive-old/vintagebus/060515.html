I got a Pioneer Supertuner 8 track player in the 61 red vw microbus.   Found 
it factory refurbished at KP a few years ago for $15.   It's the top of the 
line auro 8 track player.  This weekend at the canpout Luke was confused when 
he tried to put a CD in it.  The look on his face was excellent 'You weren't 
kidding when you said this thing played 8 tracks'.
 Thing is,  you gotta use those cleaner tapes, as the old tapes are dirty, so 
run the cleaner tapes through the machine every so often, especially when you 
get 'new' old tapes. takes th fuzzy sound away.   I need to hook better 
speakers up- the Pioneer does have good sound and the crappy speakers dont 
help.  Planning on building some sort of speaker box that mounts to the 
existing speaker brackets in the upper rear corners,  something like in the 
back of the so 23ish westys.  headliner there in th 61 is toast anyway

Still looking for Black Sabbath's Paranoid on 8 track.

Got an 8 track/radio in the garage, and have a stack in there.  need more Led 
Zepplin.  Bruce likes Led and I've only got two tapes of them.

think the bus in Alice's restaurant was big back hatch, SWR/BG with the 
basalt interior- a 64 standard

 &gt; And what did you find to play 8-tracks on?  I still have a player, but
 &gt; not hooked up.  My '67 Westfalia has an 8-track/AM/FM/CB in the dash.
 &gt; Talk about time warp.  Since the Westy is about two projects away from
 &gt; working (I drive a Deluxe and hope to start the double cab sometime this
 &gt; summer), it'll be fun to resurrect that little unit when I get to it.
 
 I'd love to have an 8-track/am/fm - i'd assume the CB is a separate unit -
 i'd also like to have a CB.  Anyway, I found a NOS 8-track/fm player on ebay
 for about $22.00 http://cgi.ebay_dot_ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=884548127
 I had to change the rubber belt inside as it had decomposed over the past 30
 years? but once I replaced the belt with one from a VHS machine the 8-track
 works perfectly.  Pretty much all old 8-track players need to have the
 rubber belt replaced but it is very easy to do and the belts are very easy
 to find.  Of course virtually all tapes must be repaired but that's a
 relatively easy thing to do.  The 8-track started as a bit of a joke and it
 has become an obsession.  Initially I found a player and a box of tapes for
 $5.00 at a garage sale a few years ago so I bought it ..... now I have about
 300 tapes all of which I've taken apart and repaired - they now all work
 like new.  I'm more of a CBC (Canadian Public Radio) guy anyway so the
 8-track is more for fun and the FM is what counts.
