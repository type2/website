Subject: What happened to Sta-Lube GL4 in AZ?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

    OK this is the deal, I went down to 5 local FLAPS and NONE of them had 
any in stock.  About a month ago I went in and it was right there just 
waiting for me.  So what gives?  Anyone in Arizona know of a for sure source 
for this stuff?
