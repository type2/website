Subject: Thanks! (no bus content)

Sorry for the bandwidth but I don't have email addresses.
 
Augusta and I want to thank those of you who made our trip to Jerome this year the best AZ adventure yet. 
We want to thank Ronnie and his wife who were kind enough to provide a midway rest spot for us, cold ice tea and good conversation even though we drove one of those &quot;fried egg&quot; buses!
 JP was also kind enough to extend an invite to a pre-Jerome camp-out with him and some companions from Albuquerque. It was another night of good times and conversation even though Gus was a little well done because I forgot the gas heater was on but she survived. 
  
Thanks again and we hope to see you soon. 
 
Sean
