Hi All,
I just obtained another bus today and I am having
difficulty figuring out what it is.  A general description
is as follows.  It has the small rear hatch window with the
sliding bar to support it.  It has flat front turn
indicator lights but I am not certain they are original.
It has three non functional vents high above the working
vents on each side. It also has some sort of funky camper
conversion, all wood, with aluminum sliding windows that I
have seen on another bus somewhere.
It has an ID plate behind the passenger seat with the
following info:
1B 052
360 027 178 195
uy 211 blue 948738

This plate is attached with screws, not rivets, I am not
sure it hasn't been replaced.  The bus has been in the same
place for 20 years and hasn't ran in at least 15.  Anyway for 200 bucks it 
has a plethora of parts. So what is it?
