&lt;&lt; I just got fixing my new bus!
 It was presented as a '66 Combi, with a two
 tone paint job, white over red.  The interior panels
 are the cheapo ones, no pop-outs, so it's a kombi.
 No uprights or overriders for the bumpers either.
 The right mirror arm is broken off, but the original 
 driver side one is round.  It has all of the seats!
  &gt;&gt;
congrats on the new Bus!!!!!  

no pop outs at all?  that is unusual.   what is the VIN?  It'll tell you what 
model in the second digit.  a 66 combi's VIN is 236 xxx xxx ,  the 3 stands 
for combi model.
