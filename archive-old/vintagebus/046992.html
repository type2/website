My wife and I tried to go to the one in August a couple years ago after the
Familianfest (sp?), which was great, BTW, and gave up after being turned away
&gt;from at least 5 gates and finally directed to the first gate we went to (main
one).  We were asking at each gate if and where we could set up a club booth
for the Arizona Bus Club (I was Pres. at the time) and promote our Jerome
Jamboree (we were in the Raffle Bus for that year).  It seemed as if no one
knew what a &quot;club booth&quot; was!!!  Finally at the first, then last, main gate
we were told to wait for the promoter to come talk to us.  When he finally
showed up and asked what we wanted, we told him, and he had some wise crack
for us about the world revolving around us or something.  We turned around
and went back to Phoenix, vowing never agian to TRY and go to this Jaboree.

Sorry for the limited bus content, but I couldn't resist relating my story.
