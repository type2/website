tank through the gas cap?

Hi Richard,
The original gas caps have a spiral valving system in that thick center area
of the gas cap.  Over time though this tiny spiral gets clogged with gas
varnish or dirt/corrosion.  Sometimes you can get this venting system cleaned
out by spraying carb or brake lining cleaner chemical into the venting
system.  Otherwise you might have to pin prick the seal to allow the air to
get in the tank and stop the build up of vaccume.  Ours have always leaked if
the bus is parked the wrong way on a hill with full tank.  Have learned to
park with the gas cap side uphill or to fill up only when heading out for at
least a 20-30 mile trip before parking.  Eric&amp;Barb
