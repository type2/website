&gt;   I was wondering if anyone could inform me which way to install my
&gt;vent wing rubber strip.  It is the straight strip that goes in the back
&gt;that the actual glass comes into contact with when it is shut.  It is
&gt;about a foot long.  Do the 2 or 3 little lips go to the outside(contact
&gt;with the glass itself) or does the rounded off side go to the outside

Yes, the lips go against the glass, not the rounded part.

&gt;and connect with the glass?  Thanks!  Oh yeah.  Are rear hatches

I don't know about wide-hatch buses, but the narrow-hatch *is* adjustable;
there's
a series of screws at the top; loosen them up and it will slide around.
I'll bet
the late hatches can be adjusted in a similar fashion.

&gt;adjustable?  How about engine lids?  They don't look like it.   Thanks,

Same deal: loose the screws on the body side, and the plate will slide
around a little.
