Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter thingy bolt size?

yes, same thread size for the gas tank strap hold down bolts.  Dunno if they are the same length.  

for ~60 &amp; earlier they were 14mm heads

as of ~61 &amp; later buses everything that was 14mm hex heads magically became 13mm heads... from the engine case bolts/nuts to the rear tranny mount bolts/nuts to the front door bolts that hold the window frame on, bolts/nuts that hold dash tray to the steering column bracket, etc.  My personal theory is that this happened when they switched to push on connectors from the screw terminal connectors, but I have no documentation to back up this claim.

I was very confused when I got a later split (my first splitty was a 59) and I kept having to go get the other tool.  :(

your bus may have some of each, as nuts and bolts were replaced over the years.

&gt; So - I've been scratching my head trying to figure out what happened to the
&gt; two bolts that hold down my gear - shifter plate thingy ......noticed two bolts holding down my gas tank - are those the same thread
&gt; size - but jut take a smaller socket - i.e. have a smaller 
&gt; head - even tho they are the same bolt.
