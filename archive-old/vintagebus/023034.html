Get a 'burb or a full-size 4-door truck

(that's the beer talkin' - this email will come back to haunt me some day!)

&gt;Hey folks, here's a question on behalf of my mom...
&gt;
&gt;Well, I think she's got her heart set on getting rid of our Merkur and
&gt;getting a truck.  She feels it's time we own something that can tow any of
&gt;our VWs if they breakdown.  There are 4 people in our family, so we gotta
&gt;keep that in mind.  But I know a lot of listees have haulers that,
&gt;naturally, we all stay quiet about. &lt;g&gt;  But give us some
&gt;recommendations...what do you own? what do you like?
