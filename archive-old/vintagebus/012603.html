	I've been at a horse show and the night before last I had to pull the knob
in and out a couple of time before the headlights would come on. Last night
going to the show I had a little trouble again, but at the horse show, NO
LIGHTS. I finished my work and called AAA. By the time AAA came out the Bus
no longer started. Could the light have drained the battery? I did try to
put them on several time while I tested any loose wired underneath the
dash. The lights inside the Camper work.
	I have 9 hours to get back out to the show. Since I bought the Camper I
have put $1500 worth of repairs in, so it's not like it hasn't been to the
mechanic and checked over. I was told the electrical was a mess by that
shop in Indio.  Of course now I can't use AAA to tow it anywhere and the
closes garage, for those of you who know my story is Cheat I mean Chet and
Cliff's so you know I can't go there. Woey woey woe. Did I mention it's
pouring rain here?
	Anyway how I can check out the problem? Any quick fixes that I can do so I
can get it to a garage? Anyone in Sacramento can refer me to a closer
garage then Economy? I'm now near El Camino and Interstate 80. I can try to
push the Bus down the street and try to con AAA to tow it their 5 free
miles. Don't even ask me how mush it cost to tow last night.
	Thanks for any in put. I'm really worried.

P.S. The woman that I get work from said I couldn't be relied upon with
such a old vehicle. What a mess.
