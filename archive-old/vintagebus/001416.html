Subject: 1960 Bus question

I was over at a guys house yesterday that owns a 1960 Bus.  It still had the original transmission in it due to low mileage.  The owner said that 1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case tranny.  He reported that this was normal for the early tunnel-case transmissions, sort of an in-between thing.  I was surprised, I thought once the tunnel-case came around, all forward gears had synchros.  True or False?

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
