&gt; The average yuppie in the crowded urban neighborhood of Lincoln Park in

&gt; regard for their fellow man or the environment.  This may sound funny coming
&gt; from a conservative Republican type like myself (as I usully protest any
&gt; form of taxation) but I strongly feel that gas is way to cheap in the US and
&gt; higher taxes should be levied to encourage more sensible, fuel efficient
&gt; vehicles.  I know that my freinds in Germany do not drive SUVS!!  I would
&gt; not mind paying $3 per gallon for gas if it meant getting some SUVs off the
&gt; road.

IN which case, I respectfully submit that you should go to Germany where
you can enjoy their superior taxation!  :)

Some people consider our buses (or any car for that matter) to be
wasteful, and think that we should all be on bicycles.

Seems to me that we should all just get along.  The SUV folks have a lot
more political clout than we do.  If we annoy them we might not appreciate
the results!
