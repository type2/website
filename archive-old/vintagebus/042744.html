&gt; metal!  We are planning to cut and weld into all our buses the nut plates

&gt; the belt when mounted into the front seat backing sheet metal.
Actually,

Submarining is when you slide out of your seatbelt into the
footwell...  Picture the seatbelt being the waterlevel and your body being
a submarine submerging.  Racers put an anti-submarining strap between
their legs...

What happens when you have the seatbelt anchor below your shoulder i know
not a name for, but if you hit something hard enough that belt will crush
your shoulder like a twig and cut into you in a very damaging manner.

If you have a setup like this, undo it and use lapbelts only.

take care,

Steve
