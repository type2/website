  I just got a call from a customer who called to tell me about his new bus.
He just found a 54 BD Kombi, totally complete with all seats etc. It had be
setting for years and the owner just decided to get rid of it, how much you
wonder, you couldn't buy a BD part for what he paid.

some people have all the luck

Ronnie

ps, I will add the numbers to the registry when he gives them to me.
pps, it is not for sale or any of the parts off of it
