Subject: Re: [VB] Engine/body seal - it can be done/useless information

 &gt;You can spend about 15 minutes and half a handful of pink liquid
anti-bacterial soap and install the seal

FWIW, DO NOT use anti-bacterial soap... soap IN ITSELF kills bacteria; the
chemicals in 'anti-bacterial' soap merely promote bactricide-resistant
strains, so that the next time you cut yourself while working on the van,
instead of a stiff mildly-infected knuckle you get a flesh-eating sepsis.

Anti-bacterial soaps are a waste of money and a counter-productive product
of the fear-mongering advertising industry. Save that $1.00 and apply it
to a QUALITY engine seal!!!!!!!

BTW, my wife is a doctor who feels passionately about this nonsense - this
isn't just an anti-canola type email :)
