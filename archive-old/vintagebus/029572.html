&gt; Now...the coolest thing of all. On the way home I stopped in a small
&gt; town to take a pitstop and a nice dressed southern gentlemen walked
&gt; over to me and asked me if I wanted another one of those old vans.

I had that same thing happen to me while dragging a 67 Westy home from ID.  Two
older guys in an Olds 98 (the car of choice ;-) rolled up along side and started
yelling and pointing.  I almost wrecked trying to pull over thinking the bus was
coming off the trailer.  We rolled down windows and he yells &quot;want another one
like that?&quot;. &quot;uh...yeah!&quot; At the next rest stop I talk to the guy.  Turns out it
was a orange bay window with no tranny.  What a find.

Needless to say I only came home with one Westy.

Good hunting Rex
