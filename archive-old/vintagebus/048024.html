   was writ:

    To reiterate one more time, you need to set the 009 to at least
10 degrees BTDC initial advance, and you need to either (a) buy a crank
pulley with degrees on it (make sure it's the stock diameter), or (b)
measure out the degrees and file a new notch or make a paint strip on
your old pulley.
-       -- - - - - - -  -- 
just picked up a good 010 distrbutor to put in my 65.    Took out the 009 
that was perfectly functional,  (I wrapped it in a clean rag and stuck it 
under the z bed to add to my spare parts collection,  dumped a new set of 
point for the 010 in the spare bits box).   

Anyway,  it didn't fix that hesitation problem the flat spot so associated 
with 009s, think I need to mess with the carb agin, cause I rejetted it 
recently and think that upped the hesitation.     

anyway, I tend to time by getting out the strobe light, turning the engine on 
and playing with it till it sounds right.  hopelessly unscientific I know.  

So who has ideas on timing a 010?

And i always check to make sure it advances.  Cause I know someone whose 
motor overheated on a road trip cause the dist advance broke.   I have had 
the advance break twice on me- but you can hear that - a wierd tone- and if 
on FWY can manually set it to 30 BTDC for FWY driving.  temporaily.  so 
carrying a spare and the strobe light isn't a bad idea eh?
