anyone in the fla. area looking 4 a project car ,i viewed one 4 sale in
the orlando are.I have the guys number.I will say i ama body man by
profession ,it's ruff but it is all there,he says he has lots of parts
for it up in his attic.I didn't view them but the car is fixable.Not
like the single cab i picked up this weekend in nc.Even though mike had
some calls from people wanting it to restore ,as a professional i would
not waste my time.The oval is worth the time if you have it.     X bugJ
