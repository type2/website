Won't report on the shows as this has been done. Here are my driving stats
for the 5 days. Total miles driven  1459 . Total gals. gas were 85.1 gals,
which comes out to 17.14 mpg. Drove through 30 to 50 mph winds, rain so hard
you could only see about 100 feet out front, up and down some great hills.
Think worst mpg was 14.6 driving from Yucca Valley to El Mirage dry lake
with a head wind so strong could not go over 55 mph floored on a flat road.
Best was leaving Los Banos and heading down Hwy 99 with a tail wind, a
little over 20. 5 mpg. All this and cruising between 65/70 when possible or
floored into the head wind. Had the single wheel trailor, and the rack and
bus were both loaded. Was a great trip and I still have to sit sideways on
the chair with right bun in the air, have Denise change the Band-Aid twice a
day. It was a hot time Friday night at Red Barn. Thanks to Taylor and all
the SV'2's and Jetrow and Sandy for the great beach campout. Wish I knew how
to speak French. Congrates to Everywhere Ed, and Scott Masden ( hot vw's
artical on his camper). See you all Friday June 8th at Rich Yost's house for
the pre OCTO campout and 100 bus caravan to OCTO Sat AM. from Rich's.
