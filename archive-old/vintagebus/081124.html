Subject: Re: [VB] sapphire radio

Hi Josh,
Hmmm, we have never seen a Sapphire VII!  Our late 1966 VW dealer accessory 
book does not show that model so it probably came out after 1967, but not too 
much later because of the 6 or 12 volt switching would be so if an earlier VW 
owner came into the dealership with thier VW wanting a radio....  Which seems 
to happened quite often when an owner paid thier last time payment on the VW, 
and because here in the USA the radio had to be a dealer or aftermarket item.  
Unless the VW was a &quot;Tourist pickup&quot; from the factory or Euro gray market, the 
import laws here did not allow radios to be imported already mounted in brand 
new automobiles.
  Does it have the split shafts for the pre-1968 knobs or the ones shaped 
more like a &quot;D&quot;?  As for what band or bands, you need to look at the face where 
the needle is and take note of the radio frequency numbers there and either 
list them to us or compare them to other radio faces you do know.   IE FM band 
goes from 88 thru 104, in comparison AM goes from 570 thru 1600.  
  As for &quot;worth&quot; it depends on quite a few factors, rarity, demand for that 
model of radio, condition, how complete it is, and of course does it work?.....
