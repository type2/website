&gt; I spoke with a couple of the guys from Rancho Performance last year and
&gt; they said it does not matter which gear oil is installed in the tranee's.

The list wisdom seems to be that something in the GL-5 will eat the
brass synchro rings in air-cooled VW transmissions.  This has been
anecdotally confirmed by a lubricant distributor
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/049483.html and also confirmed
by the tech support of various oil companies
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/064584.html .  Note that this
latter message also has the Sta-Lube part number for their one quart
bottle of GL-4 and their handy dispensing pump.

Since Rancho rebuilds transmissions, maybe they install something other
than brass or bronze when they replace the synchro rings, bushings, etc
and it really doesn't matter what oil you put in a tranny they have
rebuilt.  Or maybe they're trying to increase your repeat business for
rebuilds...  &quot;Never ask a barber if you need a haircut.&quot;  :)

I found the gallon jugs of Sta-Lube GL4 out on the shelf at the local
NAPA.  I suspect that some tractors or other farm equipment might also
prefer GL-4 to GL-5, so the GL-4 might be more readily available in
places where there are a lot of farms.

http://www.crcindustries_dot_com/auto/content/products_ss.aspx?ID=97 and a
little clicking reveals the following part numbers for Sta-Lube GL-4
85W90 oil:

SL24229 32 Fl Oz
SL24239  1 Gal
SL24259  5 Gal
SL24279 16 Gal
SL24299 55 Gal

If you really want to have fun, the official VW specifications for gear
oil are in section T of the Bentley manuals.  You could send a copy of
those to your favorite oil company and ask which product of theirs meets
those specs.

Standard disclaimers apply; I don't get money from any of the companies
mentioned.
