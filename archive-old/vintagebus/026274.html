&gt; Wood: Where can I get a sway-away front sway bar? Price?

---------------I believe I bought the rear from the &quot;nice&quot; people at Barrett
Enterprises,it's cost was about $50.
The front was about $180 from RMW ,plus 35 more bones for the stainless
clamps.Pricey,but it does give me peace of mind. Especially when I am driving long
distances with my kids to go camping.

ps.This has been the best year for camping that I can recall!
Camping again this weekend in the '64 with no need for heat!!!!
were still in short sleeves  here in Chicago.
