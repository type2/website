:Pandora's brakes (64 with 67 running gear front and rear, single circuit
:master cylinder) have been pulling hard to the right lately. Tried
:adjusting it out, that didn't help. Suspected contamination, installed new
:shoes left side, didn't help.
:
:Rebuild the master cylinder next? The MC in it now has very low miles but I
:didn't install it, the PPO did. Everything bleeds fine, there doesn't seem
:to be a blockage, and everything on the left side seems to actuate fine
:with the hub off.

Ken, 
  Odd as it may seem, when I have experienced this phenomenon, the contamination was on the side to which the brakes pulled (right). Also, ALWAYS replace the shoes on both sides, otherwise they will never stop evenly. This is the voice of experience speaking. HTH
