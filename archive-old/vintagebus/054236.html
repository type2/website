&lt;&lt; Subj:     [VB] Engine dies at low speed

 My bus has begun dying at stop signs, and sometimes, when I take my foot off
 the accelerator to go around a corner or just slow down the engine dies.
 This is a relatively new situation, always before it idled very well.
 The problem started when I discovered that the tube which carries the
 accelerator cable through the fan shroud had become displaced and was
 pressed up agains the carbuerator linkage. I moved the tube back to its
 correct place, but now I'm experiencing the problem above.
 Any tips?
 Thanks in Advance

You forgot to mention what year your bus is. If its new enougn to use the bug 
1600
engine or whatever, you may have a bad bypass air cut-off valve. Its item 6 
in the latest RMMW catalog. Usually, the head gets knocked off (the thingy 
that exists to the far left of item 6 in the RMMW catalog) causing the engine 
to stall instead of idle. The solution is to replace the bypass air cut-off 
valve for $18.95. It screws onto the carb.
