Hi volks

luke just sent this my way and I wanted to pass it on to everyone, the round
table pizza is now closed if you havent driven by recently, last time steve
drove by a couple of days ago the place was being gutted


&gt;The Cascade Kombi meeting has been moved the University Burger Master.
&gt;Since everyone knows where that is, we'll meet there this month and review
&gt;our meeting options.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, this message is going out to 12 people.  Pretty good!  Let's make a
&gt;point of asking for any and all e-mail addresses at the next meeting...
