Perhaps 'anonymous' was worried that Greg's singlecab would be sent to
Japan and end up looking like one of these vehicles:

&gt; Hello...........it's not because of race, its because you know where its
&gt; going. And why don't people want the buses to go there, because look what its
&gt; done. Driven the prices to an insane level, and taken the fun out of it. WAKE
&gt; UP and get a clue, does everything have to be racist? But at least Greg was
&gt; straight up and said he was in the business of selling buses to japan, while
&gt; others deny the fact and try to hide it. And everyone on the list can flame
&gt; me, cause you know what, I will hit the delete key and go to sleep.
