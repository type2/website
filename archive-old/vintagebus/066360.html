I have found at&amp;t to have much better coverage. Verizon doesn't have
consistent coverage in some areas they claim to. Pretty disappointing when
you break down in your bus in a populated area and still can't get coverage.
When you complain they don't care because you're on the hook for a year and
there are more to replace you when the year is up.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone on their lists use Verizon for there Wireless Phone Service
when
&gt; &gt; Traveling in the buses, and regular use also of course.  I'm wanting to
change
&gt; &gt; from SunCom and Verizon seems to have a better plan.
