&gt; I just got off the phone with the VW Manual editor for Bentley 
&gt; publications
&gt; and was informed that they do have all the early 1959 and 1960-1962 
&gt; service
&gt; and parts manuals but at this time have no intention of reproducing 
&gt; due to
&gt; lack of demand. I was told that if they recieve enough input that 
&gt; they will
&gt; consider it. So, send them your e-mails and bug them and it might 
&gt; come to
&gt; happen.
