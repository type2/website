&lt;&lt; Have seen a scant few NOS clips for a scary price
 sometime ago. This might be a case wherein &quot;real&quot; is
 the only way to go... &gt;&gt;

Believe it or not, these clips are still available from VW.  If you need the 
part number, p-mail me after I've gone to the shop to look at the little bags 
I've gotten them in.  I don't recall them being expensive, but don't forget 
to get the correct rivets either!
