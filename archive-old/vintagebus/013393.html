Subject: 36hp Heater Box Question
Message-ID: &lt;19990704170904.23382.rocketmail_at_web125.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know what is the correct heater box for a '59 36hp? I have
two sets of heater boxes, one set where the box is very rectangular,
and another set is a bit more &quot;round&quot;. What year did they change the
36hp boxes?  

Both boxes bolt up correctly on a 36hp.  The J-tubes are the same on
both.  Also what are they worth?  
-Phil
