Hmmm, that one was in grey primer and this one the color is grey.  Nah, no
one would be insane enough to sell a primered Single Cab for $9500, would
they?

Although, if it is Diesel, that would be sweet.

&gt;&gt; ================================
&gt;&gt; Here it is:
&gt;&gt; 1954 Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup $9500
&gt;&gt; Barndoor single cab bus. Mostly restored, been in storage. RARE!RARE!
color: grey
&gt;&gt; 503-559-8168
&gt;&gt; ================================
&gt;
&gt;It is even in my neck of the woods... I should call...actually, I bet it
&gt;is the one I posted on Ev's page some time ago, it sold to someone in
&gt;the 503 area code.
&gt;That was a nice singlecab! I shoulda bought it for $3k when I could
&gt;have.
