&lt;&lt; last night a buddy and i were shooting the sh*t and admiring our type 2s
 when i remarked that the front bumpers on our volkswagens are different.
 they're both pressed bumpers but the one on his panel has a wider area in
 the center between the two raised areas while the bumper on my truck has a
 smaller area between the two raised areas.  his panel is a '54 and my truck
 is a '56.

yes there are two versions of the stamped front bumper.  The one with the 
longer pressed bits (smaller liscence plate area) is earlier.  It was used 
until sometime in 56, but I am not sure exactly when.  AFAICFO, it is one of 
the differences between Wolfsburg buildt buses and Hannover buses.   They 
moved the factory in mid 56, and made changes about that time- about ch 178 
004.

the Wolfsburg buses have a tubes for the tranny carrier, rather than a U 
shaped channel.  The doglegs are three pieces of metal attached.  You have 
discoved the Wolfsburg bumper .  Turns out that your friends panel has the 
wrong bumper.   I would be interested if your 56 truck has the round tranny 
tube and three piece doglegs and what its vin is, and I am trying to make a 
list of buses around this change.  You probably have the original bumper on 
your truck.

they made these changes a year after barndoor production ceased.   there are 
a bout 60,000 post barndoor Wolfsberg buses.

 in the process of bringing his panel back from the rusty grave, he's
 discovered that barndoors are different in practically every respect from
 type 2s even just a few years younger.  the logical thought is that the
 front bumpers would be different but in what way?  is one of these bumpers a
 barndoor bumper?  does the fact that one of the volkswagens is a truck
 figure into the equation at all - after all if the rear bumper is
 truck-only, why should the front be any different?  we looked through my bus
 books but what we saw only seemed to point to my truck wearing a barndoor
 bumper and his barndoor wearing a non-barndoor pressed bumper.  (if this is
 true it might explain why my truck appeared to be sitting so tall and
 proud... on the other hand it could be just the giant tires it wears.)
 
 in hopes of helping you knowledgeable folks out and since i didn't feel like
 doing my library work, i created a web page with pictures of the fronts of
 our crusty machines:  &lt;A
