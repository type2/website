Subject: RE: [VB] Which Heater?

Do you already have the duct work in the buss?  If not it will have to
be cut in unless you go with a under dash heater which are real hard to
find!  I would not go with the Webasto as I have never been able to find
replacement part for them!  You can find parts for the Stewart Warners
and the Eversprachers!   Eberschracher came from the factory installed
and Stewart Warners were installed state side!
The Stewart Warner would be correct for you bus as would a  early
Everspracher

 Subject: [VB] Which Heater?

Here are a couple of links to some ads on The Samba that I was checking
out. They are ads for gas powered heaters and I'm not sure which one
would either be the right one for my 63 or the one that has the best
track record as far as reliability? Wondering if anybody with heater
experience had any input?
