Heck, I use *too much* grease when I'm putting stuff together.
I end up making a huge mess all over the place, like when
I did the front end on the '55.  But I don't think the bus minded
parking on the greasy spot that night; it hadn't been lubed like
that in years...

&gt; Probably for the same reason they call the 55-61 blinky front turn signals 
&gt; &quot;nipples&quot;.    Though it seems like the guys don't like to use grease when 
&gt; assembling things, they just don't understand the importance of lube.
