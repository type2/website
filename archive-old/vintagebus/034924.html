I would skip the hassle and install the original type.  If you want to put 
the 67 type in you need to alter the bus, which is a PITA, and probably hard 
to get just right, though surely it is possible I have no doubt, I just doubt 
the return on the work.   Just replace all your shift bushings and reinstall 
the shift mechansim.  I have the earlier style in my 65 and it has nice tight 
shifting.    I have not seen any improvement in the 67 style in drivability.

&gt;  am debating which type of gear shift linkage to put back in my '63 deluxe 
&gt;  project.  
&gt;  
&gt;  Experts can skip this-
&gt;  The stock '63 linkage has the bolted on gearshift rod support which 
&gt; encircles 
&gt;  the rod.  I cut the other support out of my 67 donor.  It is the type with 
&gt;  the dowel pin at the front of the gearshift rod.  All this is shown very 
&gt;  clearly on Bently page H-9-2 and 3.  The change was in September 65.
&gt;  
&gt;  Back to my question-
&gt;  Anyway, all the busses I have driven, including friends busses, have been 
&gt; the 
&gt;  later dowel pin type.  So I don't know what the early type &quot;feels&quot; like.  
I 
&gt;  am putting in a Rancho stock 67 tranny.  I took measurements of the dowel 
&gt;  before I cut it out of the donor, so I am ready to weld it in.  Also, I 
have 
&gt; 
&gt;  have all the matching parts for both systems.
&gt;  
&gt;  Comments and opinions appreciated.
