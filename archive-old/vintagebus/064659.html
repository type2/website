&gt;   I don't want to rebuild the carb as of yet.  Can I soak it w/o damaging

Hi Eric,
Do you have any local volks who can loan you a working 34PICT-3 carb to test 
for a few minutes for bucking?  If the bucking goes away just screw old carb 
apart completely apart except for the throttle shafts, and then you can soak 
it, followed by a spraying out passages with carb cleaner.  Check the type2 
library for 34PICT-3 carb setting proceedure.  Blowing pressurized air onto a 
closed carb can easily implode the fuel shut off float inside!
