from Gabriel that wasn't the right part. Aren't 62 and 63 doors the same??

I had him re-key it and everything but the lever inside is longer than the

original. If anyone has a contact # for him, please pmail me.

I didn't take a lot of pictures but if you want to see what it was


 --  -- -

yes 62 and 63 are the same .  the change was in early 61 (?oct 1960?) when 
they changed the front door where the handle goes.  later pull handle doors 
have an indent where the actuall base of the handle goes on.  the early doors 
are flat there.   there are suitably different bases on the handles to fit 
the doors well.  

If you have a handle for the flat door on the indent door  yes the innard 
will seem too long.  The base is transferable,   you have to knock ot a pin 
but then again it must be knocked out when he rekeyed it as you must take the 
handle off the base to get to the key cylinder screw.     

Hope this makes sense
