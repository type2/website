Subject: From Ronnie of Oldvolks_dot_com


To all of you that have e-mailed me I'm am informing you of major mail
&gt; &gt; problems I am currently having. We have moved my server and all my
&gt; &gt; accounts, including all of my URL's have also been moved. Currently
&gt; &gt; www.type2parts_dot_com is not working properly, but www.oldvolks_dot_com is up
&gt;and running. I am recieving e-mails, but have lost quit a few in the last
&gt;few days. This is why I may not have replied to you. Also a lot of the mail
&gt;to sales_at_oldvolks was also lost. We are working very hard to get all of
&gt;these problems corrected and should have all done within the next week.

&gt; &gt; thank-you

&gt; &gt; ronnie  Old Volks of Az
&gt; &gt; ps. if whoever sees this could they forward it to the type2, vintagebus
&gt; &gt; and vintage vw lists.
