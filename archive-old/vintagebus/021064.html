&gt; &gt;Hoping to pick the lists collective brain.

&gt; ( Glad you didn't ask about Noses, Stewart 8^)
&gt;     Several interesting possibilities-
&gt; 1) At 88 mph, hit the brakes before the garage door,

Doesn't wiork.  First, the front suspension has some anti-dive built into it (quite sophisticated for a 1930s design).
