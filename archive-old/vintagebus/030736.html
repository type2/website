Ok, this has as much Bus content as Kid's fruit drinks have real juice but
here goes...

Can I please ask people to include the http:// when they list web addresses
in their signature or in a note to the list?

Most email programs will make the web address a clickable hyperlink if you
use, for example, http://thesamba_dot_com instead of thesamba_dot_com

See the difference?  If not, get a real e-mail reader.  ;)

Thanks,
