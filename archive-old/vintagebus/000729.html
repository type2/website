Ok my 2 cents worth ,,i have 2 millers 1 250 amp 220 and a 130 amp 110,,i use 
the 110 daily in the shop ,,i have had the 250 for 10 years and only thing i 
have done is replaced the liner after i used it for 9 years ,,not bad huh, 
the 110 i have had for almost 2 years and done nothing to it only replaced 
the tip once ,,as far as down time ,,none from either machine i run a small 
bottle gas ,,not the smallest but next size up ,,if i go up a size the price 
of gas goes up ,,i run a huge bottle on my big welder and its about 75 bucks 
a pop the little tank is about 25 ,,i looked at the chep 110 welders and saw 
plastic gears or fiber of sorts ,,not my thing miller has servered me well 
,,and if i add a tig and plasma cutter they'll probably be miller or hobart 
,,i have used these 2 brands for over 20 years ,,,but go with your own 
instinct and your pocket book ,,,,,just my .02 worth
