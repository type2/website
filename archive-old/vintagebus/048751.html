Subject: Friend's bus problems

I've got a friend in town with a '67 Standard with a 1600cc DP engine 
who ran into problems yesterday. His engine sound &quot;funny&quot; and he 
pulled over quickly. When he walked to the back, there was a big 
puddle of oil on the ground. He said it &quot;looked like it was coming 
from the front area of the engine near the tranny.&quot; He checked the 
dipstick and sure enough it was low. He said below the low line, but 
there was oil. He got some more and filled it. No leaking. He drove 
home. No leaking. Morning came. No leaking. Any ideas I can give to 
him?
