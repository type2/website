While talking with a buddy of mine about Panel converted campers he told =
me something I'd never heard.

He said that if I looked behind the wood panels in the doors I'd find the=
 original metal that was cut from the doors so the windows could go in. W=
ell I went out and took the interior panels off the doors in my DD EZ and=
 sure enough there were 4 original pieces of metal sitting in the doors. =
Looks like making it back into a Panel will be a bit easier if I decide t=
o go that route now that I have the original pieces............

Anyone else ever run into this before??
