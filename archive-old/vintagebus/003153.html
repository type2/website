Subject: Re: [VB] Remove tranny without pulling motor
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

&gt; I want to pull a 71 tranny without pulling motor can this be easily done?

Sounds like the old joke about the gynecologist that decided to become an
auto mechanic. She took sixteen weeks to finish the engine rebuild at the
school, but got an A because she did the whole job through the spark plug
holes.

You can pull the engine and tranny together if you like, but dropping the
tranny and leaving the engine is like blowing hot smoke up a canary's _at_$$.
You have to hold your mouth just right, and the situation can deteriorate in
a hurry. Just do it like thousands of other satisfied customers. It will be
quicker by far, much safer, and you'll be happier knowing that you won't be
inventing a new procedure from scratch that no one else will ever use.
