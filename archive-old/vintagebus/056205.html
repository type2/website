Subject: Great VW weekend

Hi All,

I had a great VW weekend the past two days.  One day in Belgium touring BBT
in Belgium and then back to the states for the Puyallup spring meet.  I've
updated my 'recent shows' web page.
http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/recent_pictures_from_shows.htm
No pictures of the actual puyallup show as there were very few splits
actually showing (the parking lot was full of busses and a number in the
*for sale* parking lot).  Anyway, the series of pictures is more of a trip
report than a smattering of bus pics.  Enjoy.

BTW, while I found a number of great items at the show (and at BBT) I'm
still looking for a few items that I thought I plead and beg for:

- 5x12 Kamax hex bolts (8mm head) rear splash pan hardware.
- 111 711 535 Grommet for fueltap and choke cable
- others?  check out http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/partsim.htm



David
