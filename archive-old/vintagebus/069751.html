&gt;Hi Ray,
&gt;The 1600 DR DP doghouse shroud will fit SP 25 HP through 1600 engines with no
&gt;problem.  Measuring 25, 36, &amp; 40 HP stock shrouds are the same width and
&gt;thickness.  We even have converted a 40 HP engine to doghouse cooler and
&gt;shroud!

one thing i have noticed varying - the little actuator lever that 
passes thru the heads! some are different lengths, and some are bent 
different distances along the rod, or in a different direction. 
possibly POs with a pair of pliers, but something to consider!
