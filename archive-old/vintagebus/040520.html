Hey Everybody:

Does anyone have any tips on forcing the vent window glass back into the 
frame with new WCM seals?

I have struggled for 2 days with no luck. I even lubed everything up with 
white grease and still can't get the glass back into the frames.

None of the glass shops in my redneck town will touch a Volkswagen. It is up 
to me to get the things back together.

Thanks,
Skid.
