&lt;&lt; I think its easier to jump a wire from the Battery + to the coil + inside 
the engine compartment. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
The absolute best way to do this is to have a spare wire and a brass doubler 
connector.  Hook these into the left rear running light wiring.  Then to 
start your VW just turn on the running lights and put the two wires together 
to engage the starter!  To stop it then all you have to do is turn off the 
lights.  No fumbling with wires and makes restarting that much simplier.  Be 
very carefull that the loose ignition wires up front do not short out and 
burn the wiring harness. 

If your ignition has a working key, but has gone bad n the run position the 
above wiring the coil to the tail light works even better.  Eric&amp;Barb
