 Recently I acquired a 1967 single cab, and plan an ongoing restoration 
 (restification might be a better word) once it is running.  When I buy 
parts, 
 I am concerned most with authenticity, so I don't have to do anything twice 
 (or undo something I did).  Can anyone give answers to these questions:
 
 1.  bed slats--According to Meredith's &quot;Original VW Bus,&quot; pickups came with 
 wooden bed slats.  My bed has no holes where these would be screwed down.  
 Were the slats optional, only on certain years, what?
 -      - -   - - - - - - - -
believe they were standard, have the holes been filled in?

 2.  bumpers--Did my single cab come with the plain strips, or were there 
 overriders and towel bars (it is a US model)?  Did chrome bumpers ever 
appear 
 on trucks?  Regards repops, are there varying qualities as in beetles, or 
are 
 they all about the same?  Are original bumpers much more desirable?
 -  -- - - - -
a 67 us spec bus or truck would have come with overriders and tubes, the 
blades would have the pointy ends front and back.  I prefer the original 
blades and brackets.

 3.  I want safari windshields.  What should I know, like original vs. 
 reproduction value and quality; more than one manufacturer?; also do I have 
 to modify the wipers to use these windshields?

first, they leak, so if you live in a damp climate and plan on driving it, it 
will leak.   I don't care if they are new, or NOS with NOS seals.   I have 
original safaris in my 61 M140 deluxe, and they leaked with NOS seals.   Not 
much when I put the seals in, just in heavy rain then, but a few years later 
it's leak o rama.  I then got my westy, which also had original safaris, and 
took them out after the first summer and sold them to a fellow in 
Bakersfield, (who has lots of hot days and a dry climate a a shiny restored 
deluxe he wanted them for) and I had to replace the dash tray as it was full 
of rust holes. Anyway, originals are better than re pop any day, reports of 
the new better frames not withstanding.  Also I have heard much of repro 
latches being prone to breaking.  If you plan on garaging the truck and not 
driving in rain, the hinged windsheilds are very nice on hot days.

 4.  Tires--I just gotta have radial whitewalls.  From what I read, they 
 should be 14&quot;.  Smaller sizes are hard to find, so how big a tire can I use 
 (on stock steel wheels) without modifying anything?
 &gt;&gt;

I have 205 75 R14s on my 65 westy (stock rims), but am going to get 185 or 
195 LT tires.
