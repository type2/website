mmmm

don't you mean pressure in the engine compartment?  The way I understand it 
the air flow into the engine compartment pressurises it, and with better 
seals around the engine there is more pressure and so more airflow through 
the fan/cooling sytsem.   I noticed more heat flow when I fully sealed my 
engine compartment, which goes with the idea of pressurising it.

I guess I could use an air pressure guage and compare what happens at 
different speeds with more or less engine compartment sealing.  or with 
engine lid open/closed etc.
