&gt;&gt;  My bus is a pretty much stock 60. I don't want to change  redux boxes as 
I 
have a spare set and I like the idea of the cheapish  bearings in the small 
nut boxes.   &lt;&lt;



Hi John,
Can understand, but having the later RGBs is safer due to bigger  stronger 
brakes can save you much more than outright $$$.
  Plus the outer lower roller bearing in the 1964-67 RGBs is MUCH  more 
robust, so in the long run figuring cost over miles traveled, which the  later type 
also lasts much longer.  We would bet it comes  out to the same cost or 
lower.  Especially since this roller bearing is a  breeze to take apart, inspect 
for damage, and we have had no problems with  reusing these over and over.
