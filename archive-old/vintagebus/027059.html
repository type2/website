&gt;  It occured to me that perhaps with the disposable cars lasting
&gt; perhaps 7-10 years and 100-150,000 miles coupled with the fact that they
&gt; take virtually no maintenance except for a few 10 minute oil changes
&gt; over there lifetime would lead to a generation of people that have almost
&gt; never been under the hood of their cars. There is a weak urban myth that
&gt; allowing someone to tap into your cars electric will potentially damage
&gt; its delicate systems and they have no knowledge of their own to offset
&gt; this fear.

What's amazing is how completely gullible the American car buying public is
today.  Come on folks I cant believe that anyone on this list really thinks
that a 2000 model year car will only last 100K.  Modern cars are engineered
better and safer than they ever have been.  If the average driver took half
the maintenance time we do with our beloved busses, a brand new car would
have NO trouble lasting 500K.  Car companies have been hugely successful at
duping the American car buying public into thinking that a new car should
cost 30K and that after 100k  miles the car is junk. Ludicrous!

That being said, I agree completely with Andy's assessment of today's drivers
and their lack of social responsibility to their fellow human.  BTW its not
just when people are driving.  Ever notice how little people say excuse me,
hold a door open for someone else, or look you in the eyes and say thanks?

I might be a bit tainted living in L.A. though.  Been here my whole life.
Need a change I guess.

Going to look at a 2 owner CA original everything crew on Sat.  Wish me
luck!  BTW what colors did a 62 Crew come in?  What size tail lights?  Any
special 62 things to look for as far as originality go??  Thanks.

Steve
