Subject: Sacramento Bug-O-Rama/Classic - you GOTTA read this!
Mime-Version: 1.0

I just spoke with Larry Hole (BUGORAMA_at_INREACH.COM) (son of Bob Hole,
promoter of the Bug-O-Rama and now the Classic).

Seems they aren't too pleased with my comments about said shows and
whatnot, and I have been informed that I AM NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND!  You
read that right, I've been informed that I will be turned away at the gate.
 Same goes for the Classic - I've been banned from the Classic!

This is typical of their &quot;strong arm&quot; tactics.  A few years ago, a friend
of mine had a beef with them about returning an item purchased at one of
their stores.   A year or so after that, someone posted a quetion on RAMVA
asking for opinions of the shop, and of course, my friend laid out the
whole story.  The next time he went into the shop, they (the two Hole
brothers) dragged him into the back room, closed the door, and *yelled* at
him for over half an hour!  He is now one of their most loyal customers -
NOT!  I wonder why *I*'ve even set foot back in their store since then.
In addition, he was told that he could not attend the show.

People - this is NOT how you deal with issues like this.  Am I somehow
supposed to have an epiphany, recant any bad things I've ever said about
the 'rama, BugFormance, or the Hole clan?  Is there no such thing as free
speech?  

I asked for said banishment in writing, but he refused.
