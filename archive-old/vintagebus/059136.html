This is what I had on it.  Supposed to be a good distributor as it holds
back the advance at idle, then really puts it ahead when you push down the
throttle.  I think mine may have some troubles.  Anyway I had two all
vacuum distributors.  They were VW 131-905-205.  According to Jim's site
these are correct for 66-67 Bus 1500! Leftovers from 20 years ago with my
old 67 Westy I had an 010 on as well as a Truehaft (sp?) that used Mopar
parts.   I put it on after tearing the garage up going through 4 distributor
clamps.  It works better now.  Still not where I'd like but it is getting
there.  Next I'll start with the 30/31.  It came with a 120 main, I
already went down to 115, but no idle/enrichment changes yet.
