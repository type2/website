 And all these years I thought my 4&quot; chop top walkthru 1961 crewcab was the
only walkthru crew around. Oh well, there goes the value down the hill. Will
have to hope the 62 3&quot; chop top single cab more than makes up for the loss
in value of the crew. Taking offers on the unfinished single cab before
someone else comes up with one and I loose my ass again. Keep saying I'm
ahead of my time. If it don't sell will buy the 78 Mustang 302, c4, 8 1/2&quot;
disc rear and dump it in the 62 and match race Kyle all the way to Kelly
Park. Could be another little red wagon.

See all of you at Corona de Tucson March 31, April 1 in the STOCK 63 PANEL,
vw powered.
