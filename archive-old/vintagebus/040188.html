Subject: Re: [VB] They came and took my bus away :(


 &gt; Should I paint the aluminum on the Jealousy windows or just
 &gt; clean it up?

I used 000 steel wool and they look pretty good. I might try some aluminum 
polish later.  But you could paint it and if you changed your mind later, 
you could always strip it off.

good luck,
Wayne
