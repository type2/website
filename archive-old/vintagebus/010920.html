Hi folks! Yesterday I went to a junkyard in the hills that has 5 split Buses 
from about 61 to 67. I was looking for some side popout windows for my 62 and 
all these still had them. The only really nice ones were in the 65 and the 
67, but I dont know if they're compatible? Also will the popouts from the 
cargo doors interchange with the ones behind them in the body? Almost all 
these Buses also still had the rearmost seats in them. The ones which I think 
were a 61 (round taillights) and a 62 even had those front bench seats with 
the wierd brackets somebody was talking about before. I found some mint early 
sunvisors, one of those wierd ones with the masonite insert too! I'm going 
back in 2 weeks as another split which the owner doesnt know the year of - 
except that it has 'refridgerator door' handles is coming in. Does anyone 
know the size of the nut which holds the steering wheel on? I havent got my 
Bus here yet so I cant check these things. Enough of my babbling. Have a nice 
weekend everyone!
