Subject: Re: [VB] Right question, wrong answer

&gt;&gt;Anybody had any experience with a progressive carb on a 1700 type IV?
i had a bay window not long ago that i bought for a parts bus, it had that 
exact set up. it seemed to run fine although it had other issues, the PO 
didn't have any complaints of it being inadaquate either...


&gt;&gt;Will it pass emissions, adequate carburation?
sorry, can say...

i've heard from allot of people, allot of dissatisfaction with that 
particular type of carb though. as i'm sure you may have. but i've also 
heard that once you get it set up it should be pretty stable.
