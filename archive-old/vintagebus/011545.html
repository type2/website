Nazism?  It's generally referred to as Fascism, and PA-LEASE!  Fascism is
a far cry from aesthetic purism, especially in this case where someones
opinion about bus style is pretty damn harmless.  The only thing coming
full circle is 50's style paranoia (non-barn door).  And if you want to
get right down to it, Volkswagen was concieved with all attention focused
on function, with aesthetic considerations largely eschewed.  So- some
people like to stay close to those origins; unfortunate as the Nazi
connection is, the intent was brilliant...

FWIW, IMHO, FU, yadda yadda
