Subject: 1960 Flip Top Westy For Sale, a steal at $1350
Date: Mon, 1 Jan 2001 18:07:09 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

 Suprised no one in So Cal has grabbed this one yet. $1350 OBO, 1960 Westy,
missing Refer and tumbler rack only. See pictures and info at:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/yodasghia/1960_westy.html  Emailed Mike about it
and it is still for sale. Said he has a bunch of guys that want to look at
it next weekend, but first come, first buy. It's located  around Lake
Elsinore Calif. Only a short drive for alot of you. Price is $1350 OBO .
Needs usual body work, but it is an early fliptop. Someone from down that
way buy it and drive it to BBBV in Jan.

See Ya

John
