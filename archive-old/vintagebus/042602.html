Subject: brake light upgrade on my 61
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10006291038520.3636-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have been worried about how hard it is to see the brakelights on my 61,
so i did something about it.

JC whitney has halogen 1157 bulbs (these are the ones that taillights take
on a 61 bus)

The ad says they are twice as bright as the original kind and i think i
agree, now when i hit the brakes if someone is behind the bus they turn
red from the glow. I also ran a ground wire from the housing to the body,
those little pointy things they put in there to make the ground connection
are all but useless.

I have heard of too many busses with this style of taillight getting
smacked in the ass, so i think its worth the risk of the higher heat of
the bulbs possibly cracking the glass. They have been on there a week with
no ill effects so i think im out of the woods... but be warned there is a
possiblilty.

The bulbs are about $9 each.  Expensive, but i think its worth it if it
&quot;saves my ass&quot; nyuk nyuk. They will fit in a 62-71 taillight as well.
Those have plastic lenses, but i dont think that will be a problem as the
air volume in there is bigger so overall heat should be acceptable.

The chrome inside my taillight housings is pretty shot, i tried to polish
em but it didnt do much good, think i'll go with that &quot;fake chrome&quot; stuff
to get a better shine for even more light. 

take care,

Steve

p.s. as they are halogen bulbs clean out your taillight assembly with
rubbing alcohol and dont touch the bulb with your fingers, oil on them 
will cause them to go bad quickly.
