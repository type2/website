Subject: Re: [VB] Credibility

I wasn't questioning your credibility. And ambulance
fans are a M code too, by the way, where did you find
the M code plate on an early truck?

&gt; Thanks Kyle and Jim. With all of Mikes wisdom he
&gt; must have forgot that hoops
&gt; and tilts were an m-code option and they did not
&gt; come with this pickup. The
&gt; lady who I bought the bus from is in her 80's and
&gt; bought the bus when she
&gt; was around 40 if you backtrack dates on title. She
&gt; said she cut the
&gt; wheelwells to get around the mines she and her 1st
&gt; husband ran. Said she
&gt; could leave jeeps behind. She also said she thought
&gt; the cut pieces might
&gt; still be around somewhere, and by the looks of her
&gt; place I don't think she
&gt; ever through anything away so maybe they are still
&gt; around! If you think the
&gt; pickup was a find you should see the original very,
&gt; very early other VW  she
&gt; has, Go with that one Mike, and damn the hoops! She
&gt; said it was not for sale
&gt; now and was having a vw motor rebuilt on &quot;the coast&quot;
&gt; for it now. Thats the
&gt; story and I'm sticking to it.
