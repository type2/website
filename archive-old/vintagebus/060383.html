&gt;All things being equal, that is, the cylinder bases are the same distance
&gt;from the crank center, and the pistons are the same height, deck height is
&gt;determined as follows:
&gt;
&gt;Place a straight edge across a cylinder with the piston run all the way up.
&gt;For a standard 1500/1600 and 1641, you should have .060 clearance with a
&gt;feeler gauge stuck under your straight edge. That is VW's optimum clearance
&gt;for longevity with a 54-56cc head. If all of your parts are factory
&gt;tolerance you will have the optimum. I use barrel shims on the bottom of the
&gt;barrel, although my last engine was so close that I was able to use the .008
&gt;paper gaskets and be practically right on. On first time fly cut heads I use
&gt;.100 clearance.

Groovy. I'm too lazy tonite to go do the math, but it appears you
are seeking lower CR as you increase bore size with this theory,
and have three different CR values for these three engines.
Longevity ( a good thing ) is sacrificing horsepower ( another good thing ).
You have stated your preferences for CR with factory parts tolerances.
Would you be willing to offer a little more power to the blueprinter ?
