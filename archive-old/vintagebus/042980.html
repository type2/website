&gt; 1. Does anyone make replacement nose skin?

I have seen it in old catalogs either from Vintage Parts or WW, but not
recently.


&gt; 2. What's the going rate for one hacked off a wrecked bus?

Mine went for 100 bucks even, at the VW Recycler yard in LA off of Arrow
Highway there in El Duerte (sp?). That was in late 94.
I have seen them at recent shows for 200.

&gt; 3. How hard is it to put on - anyone done this before?

Not difficult but there are many different ways to go about it, depending
on damage level and your skills.



&gt; 4. With the exception of the blinker lights - are nose skins the same from
&gt; 60 - 67?


I would hazard a 'yes' guess on this, as the clip we used for my 67 came
from a pre -64 unit.



&gt; 5. Is it easier to get a nose skin with a dash already attached?

NOT necessary - the welding is straightfoward enough - you can cut in many
ways. You will have to rebuild the bottoms of the windshield frames anyway
- any clip you find will be rusted there. We used double-angled-iron
pieces which were slit and bent at the corners, then filled in. The spot
welds at the frame areas can be removed easily with a bodyshop technique
that Thom could prolly tell you - I don't know it but watched it done. 



&gt; 6. Are the dashes the same? - with the exception of the cutout for the
&gt; clock
&gt; 

Can't answer this one.


&gt; My nose skin  is good until you get down to area above the bumper. Here the
&gt; PO has tried to pull out a good size dent with a puller - drilled lots of
&gt; holes - didn't do a very good job. The area below the lip which has the
&gt; holes for bumper mounting has started to rust-out in places. I guess I was
&gt; wondering if it would be easier to replace the bottom half of the nose or
&gt; do the whole thing......I guess I'm just exploring my options...


We ordered the Das Bulli Haus parts numbered 2-6, the whole lower
enchillada - the parts quality was excellent. Goto www.vintagebus_dot_com and
click the LINKS link, Das Bulli is on the second line.
