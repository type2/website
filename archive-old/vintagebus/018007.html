&quot;Also I have replaced the rubber seals between the window frame and the
front doors but they still let water onto the door panels what is the easy
fix on this if anyone has had this problem&quot;
*******

i beleive water alwasy passes through the door, at least whenever it rains, or
you wash your car. The door was designed to have water pass through it. What
you are supposed to do it line your door with plastic...somewhere between the
door panel and the door, you need to allow the water to go through the door
and out the two holes on the bottom of it. I have never put this plastic in,
as my door panels are so warped, and screwed up. Upon replacement i will do
it...

if you check the archives i am sure there are a few different ways of
installing this plastic...each one is &quot;The Best&quot; way to do it.
