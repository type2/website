hello to all,
My turn signals havee some issues and I was hoping that all y'all could help
me knock some sense into them. when i signal my turn, they are sometimes
stubborn and want to just flicker and then finally blink and then blink a
few times and then flicker again. it's very irrational behavior in my
opinion and there is no pattern in their actions. I am thinking it has
something to do with the signal lever end since they both do it (it's a
conspiracy). do I just need to scrape them off a little? maybe pour some
coke on there to eat away the nasties? or is it something else? i'm not much
of an electrician, although i'd like to understand it better, since this is
my weakest point when it comes to mechanical knowledge. any guru help would
be very much appreciated.

also, how hard is it to get my hazards working? it's not a neccesity, but it
would be a nice thing to have. it just bugs me that i don't know what's
going on with all these wires. TIA.
