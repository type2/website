&gt;Ron, the new German heat exchangers arrived today. In words of one
&gt;syllable - WOW!
&gt;
&gt;People, when was the last time any of us saw a brand spankin' new German
&gt;Heat Exchanger?That's what I thought. Well, I just received two brand
&gt;new ones courtesy of Ron. They arrived in perfect shape.
&gt;
&gt;Ron, thanks again for a good deal. I'm tempted to get another pair. What
&gt;are the chances? Any left?

&gt; ron warned me that the heater cable attachments are on the wrong
&gt; side, but i persisted :-)  so now i'm trying to figger our a way to wire
the
&gt; heater cables up for the new boxes in my '60. any suggestions?


 I have about ten pair left at this point.  I will try to get more when
they're gone but am not sure if I can.  (And even if I can, it won't be
until at least February.)

Just to clarify, these heater boxes have the correct linkage for a '68-71
bus.  They will also fit a Bug or a pre-68 bus, but the linkage will be in
the wrong place.  You will have to either modify the linkage, or simply wire
them open during the winter with a piece of coat hanger.  As I recall, the
linkage for a Beetle is a bit lower on the heater box than for a Bus, so
this could be a bit more of a challenge. The present Dansk &quot;universal&quot; boxes
solve this with an L-shaped arm that has two places to attach the cable (one
for a bus linkage, one for a bug).  On a splittie, isn't the linkage just on
the other end, in which case spotwelding a small tab would solve the
problem?  Otherwise, how about robbing linkage parts off of the old heater
boxes you're removing?  Just some ideas. Personally, I'm much too lazy, and
I just wire them open during the winter, since there is no time between
November and0 March that I *wouldn't* want them open anyway.
