Subject: [VB] Motor problem......

&gt;  Remember me saying how I found metal flakes in my oil, well, I took the
motor out and put a different one in until I fix the one for it, but i found
out that the flakes are magnetic, so wouldthey be from rings? bearings?
well, I guess I'll find out when I open the motor........

I remember, Matt.
Rings don't flake, hippies do !
These will be steel-backed rod bearing shells
from a spun bearing.. (About $10 for a whole set :)
You may want to check the Muir, some assembly required.
