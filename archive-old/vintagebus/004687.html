 Whatever happened to the hubcap? Can it make it to everybus in NC?  There
should be plenty of drivers coming from all over the east coast. I fear it
has stalled somewhere.

It could go north with the Canada group, then head back into the states and
points west, or just move west from there.

Anyone?  Anyone?
