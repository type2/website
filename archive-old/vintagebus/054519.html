&gt; i was in downtown chicago trying to sqeeze into a parking spot when it began

&gt; the right and left. any suggestions?

Ummm, Chicago.  Salt on the roads, right?  My guess is that you have a
broken steering pivot on your front beam.  Very bad news.  Check the beam
around the swing lever pivot.  the only cure seems to be replacement.
