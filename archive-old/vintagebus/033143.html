 I was at the supermarket this eve. thumbing through the camping mag.s and an 
article titled something like the ten best new products listed a new product 
by the Coleman Co. called the &quot;Black Cat&quot;,  advertised as a portable propane 
catalytic type heater which is safe to run in enclosed areas.  Price was 
right at $50.00 and BTUs were something like 3000.  Anyone tried or know 
anything about this,, it's still cold here in the midwest and I thought maybe 
one of these could come in handy..
