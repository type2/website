Subject: New toy for me. (61 DC)

I was lucky enought to pick up a new project over the weekend.  (I
definatly do not need a project, but could not pass on the opertunity).
I brought home a 61 Crew cab to replace the one i sold a few years
back.  It has been sitting for 7 years and was drivien by the owner as a
daily driver for the previouse 17 years.  He did not want to let it go
but had to.  I figure i will eventually get it running and in some sort
of primer state.  i want to, but will not fully restore this one.  Crew
cab's become real usless after you fix em up real nice.  They are no
good for hauling stuff.  (fun to drive though)  anyway.... We will see
what happens.

It is in good shape.  he had the notion of restoring it 7 years ago so
he started to take it apart.  All the parts are still there.  it just
needs a going thru.  It does have rust though.  it will need new front
doors, new lower nose and a new rocker under the passenger door.  It
still has original paint and what is left of the original interior.
gates are in good shape.  Came with a bunch of misc. parts as well.
Even some NOS things and a compete brake kit.

Anyway, it was too good to pass up.  it will sit for a while untill i
finish my deluxe and get the songle cab's breaks fixed.

What is the deal with the front seats on these?  My 60 had stationary
front seats.  this one has the 3 possition seat.  When did these come
in? (I thought it was 62/63).

Anyway.  just thought i would tell of my adventure.
Matthew
