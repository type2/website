Subject: Re: [VB] Instrument panel nearly there

On my recent trip to Idaho I was asked about the guages in my 61.. why bother 
with oil temp and pressure?  Do I really use the tach?   
At the time I said, well, really it just gives me something to look at on 
road trips.  Entertainment value.  But then I thought about it... and what it 
does is tell me is when to back off to prevent overheating.  Rather than guessing 
if it's &quot;hot&quot;, there's a guage to tell me how much so.     Doesn't make me 
paranoid.

Trans. ratio:

is a good start on gear ratio, and the jack up the bus and count motor 
and wheel turns by hand put us right on. Still trying to find the link 
for you. Found it

We run 205X15 wheels and tyres also,  3210 rpms at 55 mph
P &amp; C
Still in the PNW

&gt; Has anyone had any problems with instruments in that  location?


&gt; voltmeter oil temp
&gt; oil pressure
&gt; Tachometer (RPM's)
&gt;
&gt; Because then I will worry about not having a CHT and will be 
paranoid about the readings anyway
