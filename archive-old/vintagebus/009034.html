Chris:

If you are looking for new windshields, we have them for $40.00 per side.
(211-845-101E)

There are some products on the market for removing scratches in glass, but
they are for very minor scratches.

Thank You!

&quot;Customer service is not a department,
it's an attitude&quot;

&gt; The '72 has a spiffy new windsheild but the '67 is hurting. The glass has
so
&gt; many scratches and wear marks from windshield wipers that it hard to see
&gt; thru, especially at night when the oncoming headlights seem to flare on
the
&gt; scratches. I really dont wanna replace the original glass. Are they are
&gt; products and or methods that will clean, polish or restore the glass?
&gt;
