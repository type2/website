Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank cleanout (was never assume)

Okay, educate me... Aren't the idle jets the problem with a carb that won't idle? On my Beetle long, long ago the Italian gas we bought was dyed and the larger chunks would clog the jets. It may have been that the dye would settle out of the gas there. Dunno. Didn't say much for my filter... 

Remove, sucks one the idle jets to ge the dye out with my mouth (yeah...) and spit out the whatever was there and reassemble. Perfect idle everytime. 

My carb was a 34 Pict-4 (? - been 10 years+) on a 1,2L single port 40 HP in a '73 Super Beetle (stock Italian Spec).
