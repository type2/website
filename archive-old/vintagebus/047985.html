...and I will chime in with a request for Sierra VW from Fontana, CA.  Where 
I was born (the town, not the dealership 8-) and where my folks bought our 
first bus.  Have several frames and other trinkets to trade.

&lt;&lt; While we're at it -- I need mid-60's frames from Carlson Bros. in San
 Francisco. &gt;&gt;
