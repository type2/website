Matthew,

I still have the original material in my '65.

You are right, it is a rubber material, black (real dark grey?) in
color. It has a pebbled surface similar to a basket ball. Little round
dots connecting with each other in a random pattern. The dots are a
little less than an 1/8th inch in diameter. I don't have any idea where
you can find this material.
