  An interesting storey concerning POR 15. I have used POR 15 for the last
15 or more years, mainly back in my 356 resto days. 1 day I had a 356 come
in the shop for some chassis detail work, Porsche people could get preety
anal and wouldn't mind paying 5000 dollars to detail there undercarrage,
upon inspection the floor boards (which had been replaced)they had a hollow
sound to them. I pulled up the carpet and saw that the floors had been POR
15 on the inside, we then proceeded under the car and removed a section of
the undercoating (WORTH?) most 356 came undercoated from the factory. I
guess they saw how bad VW's would rust so they tried to preserve the 356 a
little longer, only to find the bottom had also been POR 15. Took out the OL
ice pick and proceeded to poke the floor, the ice pick went right through
it, oh sh#t I say to myself. We proceeded to GRIND the POR 15 off in this
section only to find the NEW FLOOR had RUSTED away. It appeared the POR 15
worked so good that it sealed the floors up, through the twisting and
flexing of the PORSCHE it had cracked the POR 15 enough to let moisture in,
the moisture had worked its way between the upper and lower layers of the
POR 15 and the floor had ROTTED out between it. I must say though that the
POR 15 is strong stuff as it was all that was left of most of the floor,
layers of POR 15 holding the rusted floor together!!

ps. after this experience at my shop we proceeded to ZINK CHROMATE paint ALL
metal before the POR 15 application.

One more question: 
what would you do to the underneath if it was mint with just some peeling 
paint and road tar ??
do you think i should clean it and under coat it 
or clean it and paint it
or clean it and use something comprable to por-15

there is nothing there (rust) and i just dont want anything to start (rust).
BTW its a 60 with 32,000 mi  orig.
which will be put back into lite service in a few weeks.
thanks all
joe
