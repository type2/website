Hi Jason,
We were at the Thing Fling also.  Bigfoot told us that the engine also had 
Duralube in it.  Makes one wonder if it was the additive or that particular 
engine that made it last so long.  Like you said not much to look at there 
unless you are into Things.  We picked up a free 1967 Bug tranny, a Saffire I 
radio, and a late Motormeter oil temp gauge.  Saw Dawn&amp;Steve of PLF, and 
visited with several other VW friends.  Very nice place to have a VW meet and 
Fantastic Weather.   Eric&amp;Barb
