Dave,
Get yourself the actual adapter kit.  I think Senor Connelly (sp?) sells 
these at aircooled_dot_net.  They're about $15 if I remember correctly and 
made by Bugpack, or marketed by them anyways.  Check the tightness of 
the bolts every now and again too as they like to come loose every now 
and again.  Also check the 4 engine-to-tranny bolts too as they will 
even come loose at times with this adapter plate, especially the upper 
ones from what I hear.  I had the ones on the pump come a litle loose 
once and it started to leak some oil.  I thought AE cases were for 71 
buses and had the bosses though?  Maybe that was AK?  Anyways, get 
yourself the adapter kit.  Its the best way.  I've seen some nasty 
home-brew &quot;adapter plates&quot; and they allow the engine to move around far 
too much.

-71 bus with rebuilt engine *with* the boses.  My old engine used the 
adapter plate.

&gt;  ( 70 Bus, engine to crossmember ).
&gt; I've heard of adapter plates for this, but can't find the info in
&gt; the library or archives
&gt; Can i weld an adapter plate to the oil pump cover , or
&gt; tee off the bottom case bolt ?
