Who cares?  Any legitimate product would be introduced and marketed
in a somewhat conventional fashion.  This is nothing but hype and name-dropping.
Not to mention a way to drag millions of visitors to a site that
doesn't really tell you anything.  I heard of it via another discussion
forum, and I made the mistake of thinking &quot;IT&quot; meant &quot;information technolgy&quot;
which is the field I'm in.

I think it's a probably a barndoor binz.
