you can not adjust the free play without the engine in, or rather you can
adjust it, but not anywhere near accurately because the pressure palte is not
pushing on the throw-out bearing, which is attached to the lever which is
attached to the cable...i think.
when you put the engine back in, you should noice your clutch pedal flip up.
