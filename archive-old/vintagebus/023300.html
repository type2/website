Well, suppose this happened at an opportune time (ie: Friday)...

I've got an electrical question for the crowd...morbid tho it might be.
Last night I went to replace a fuse in my camper and didn't think that what
caused the fuse to blow initially was still in place.  I was in an odd
position and, clearly without thinking, used my index finger to push the
fuse in place.

BZZZZAP!

I've never felt the incredible pain that an electrical burn can cause.
After that, I never really realise how often I use my index finger!  LOL
But what I'm strangely curious about is just how many volts coursed thru my
finger as that fuse popped.

Learning lessons every day...
