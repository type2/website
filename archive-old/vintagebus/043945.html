Re: a stroker motor in a Bus that is reliable.  I love this motor and it
loves me.  Use the 78mm crank and the 90.5 P&amp;Cs  BUT, get the 90.5s made
for an 82 stroke.  (compression is very user friendly this way)
Cut the case for cylinder fit
Use a modified stock VW rod
IDF 40, not duals
Engle 110 cam
a good exhaust
If you have a bit of extra $$, then go for the Demello crank and Rimco
super rods.  Have it clearanced and balanced
The great thing about this stroker moter is that there is no rod angle to
case problems and also there are no crank cheek to cam lobe clearance
problems.
Best of all, you've got yourself a 2 litre motor
Other than that, I REALLY like the 1500 cc motors.
Of course the 36 in my '56 Kabriolett Bug is another favorite too.  But
the 1300 in the '66 is a great runner too....

&gt; snip
&gt; &gt; least go with 87mm pistons instead of 85.5s they bolt right in and
&gt; &gt; increase power, especially in a bus. Good luck and keep us informed.
&gt; Bad Idea!
&gt; The 87mm slip-in p's and c's are really thin walled, and with any sort
&gt; Same with the 92mm, instead of the 90.5's.  Both have same outer
&gt; diameter, but the extra 1.5 mm inner diameter means thin walls.
&gt; Then again, if you have the bread, why not stroke that baby, and stay
&gt; with a decent sized bore? It's only money.
