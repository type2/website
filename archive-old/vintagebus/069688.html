   Lexan is a brand name of polycarbonate. The material is nearly shatterproof 
and a 1/8&quot; sheet can stop a brick at 50mph, we cut a lot of it for race car 
windshields. However it is a soft material and therefore scratches easily. It 
also becomes hazy after a few years when outside and subjected to UV.
   Lexan MR10 (and Hyzod AR) has a Marr-resistant coating on it to help resist 
scratching. For this new SLX (I think it came out in '98) GE also loaded up on 
UV inhibitors in the resin and added a custom color pigments that resists color 
change over time. The next time you see a PT cruiser, check out the front 
bumper and grill. They are injection molded in color and are not painted.
   Whether this is good time will tell. I can buff out Polycarbonate, but 
cannot repair haze or discolorization. I would prefer to be able to rub out and 
wax paint than to have polycarbonate deteriorate. Its very low maintenance, but 
once its gone, its gone....kinda like most modern cars today- don't fix, 
replace.
  BTW- if you buy plain polycarbonate, most brands (Lexan, Macralon, Hyzod) all 
come from G.E.'s resin and are therefore virtually identical. Also, never use 
windex, or any other cleaner with alcohol or ammonia in them to clean your 
Polycarbonate, acrylic, PETG, ABS, etc. They will haze and craze or discolor 
them, this means your corner windows and ABS hinge covers(bus content)! Use a 
plastic specific cleaner (do a google search on &quot;Brillianize&quot; or &quot;210 plastic 
cleaner&quot;) or mild soap and a soft cloth flushing them first to get rid of 
debris that could get trapped under the cloth and scratch. 

See ya at BYOB!
