Subject: My Bus X-Mas Gifts

At X-Mas the wife &amp; myself usually don't get gifts for each other. We spend
the $$$ on the kids instead. But I did get a couple of Bus related things
from her.

A while back we picked up a couple of new mailboxes at a garage sale for
$1.00 for the pair. I told her it'd be cool to paint one of 'em up like a
bus. A few months later to my surprise I saw just that in a VW mag as a
&quot;cool VW christmas gift&quot; selling for over $100.00. Oh well. She did one up
for me anyway. Probably cost her a total of $3.00 for paint. Looks very
cool. I'll probably post pictures after the new year.

I also got an &quot;ooga&quot; horn from my kids. I figure I'll throw on the '59
Kombi daily driver. Seems simple enough. (+ = +) &amp; (- = -). If I missed
anything, let me know.

Also while at my mothers house for X-Mas dinner, I walked out to the barn
to look over the '66 parts bus I've got stored there. I pulled up the
carpet &amp; black rubber mat in the cargo area (which I hadn't had time to do
yet, if you can believe that). To my amazement there was a nice solid
perfect condition floor! That'll look just fine in the '59 Kombi as well.
Nice X-mas gift for myself!

Hope everyone has a fruitfull '99 &amp; is blessed with many a splittie!
