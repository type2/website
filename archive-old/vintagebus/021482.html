Subject: Cargo floor panels
Message-ID: &lt;24049-3A6B6A10-28_at_storefull-115.iap.bryant.webtv_dot_net&gt;
Content-Disposition: Inline

Is there a source for cargo floor panels (15&quot;x59&quot;) other than the Pa.
and Colorado connections?  I have been trying since Oct. to find a panel
for my '67, and all they seem to have is a &quot;universal&quot; panel that is
supposed to fit my bus.  It doesn't because the corrugation is totally
different, and doesn't match in any way.  I am getting desperate because
the bus has been in the body shop all this time waiting for a new panel.
I'll even take a cut-out section if anyone has one for sale....
Thanks,
Susan
