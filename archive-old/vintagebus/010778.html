If all you really want is to lock the steering wheel, I've been
using a Kryptonite bicycle lock.  Put the big &quot;U&quot; piece under the
speedo and the end across the steering wheel spoke.  Its a good fit.  The
original &quot;Club&quot;.

I need a locking steering column to replace the original. Does anyone
besides the bus boys sell them? I am willing to put a non-locking unit in
to keep the cost down.  I like the locking feature, but I'm not hung up on
it.
