Subject: [VB] stainless muffler ?

Bob,

No doubt you will recieve many posts about possible CO2 poisoning of the
occupants. I think it was Bob Hoover that said you can take a bug
muffler, heat the exhaust tips with a torch and bend them slightly down.
You can then add a &quot;Boom tube&quot; below you muffler and have an arrangement
similar to the original setup to put the exhaust gasses near the side of
the bus.

By the way, I haven't noticed &quot;boom tubes&quot; in the vw rags. Are they
still being made? I had one on my old 72 beetle and I really liked the
sound. Of course, I was a kid then. :)

Les
