&gt;Looks like it will be a while before I get some bows!
&gt;*CHOKE* [eBarf listing for $400+, &quot;reserve not yet met&quot;]

Per my Bus owner's manual the tarp and bows weigh 77 pounds.  Assuming
that 3/4 of that is the bows, that's about 58 pounds for the bows.
At the current auction price that's about $7 a pound; at the &quot;Buy it
Now&quot; price it's about $10.35 a pound.  Not worth their weight in
gold ($4240/lb) or silver ($68/lb), but it's a fairly good predictor
of other pricing on that auction site; by those numbers, a '64 Kombi
&quot;ready for operation with driver&quot; would go for $16,500 to $24,400
and a Deluxe would go for $17,700 to $27,900.

I wonder if this pricing carries over to other makes as well?  I had
my T*mpo priced at about $0.50/lb but it looks like I may get a lot
more out of it on that auction site...  :)

&gt;'01 Baby (still on the assembly line)

Do you know what the M-codes are yet?  I hear that those are pretty
cheap to make but they really get you on the delivery charge...
