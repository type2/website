If you want a split, then mebbe you should save up and get one.  

OTOH, I don't know how hard they are to come by in your area.  A lagwagen
single cab is kinda rare in these parts, and split-window SC's
are a dime a dozen.  You could always buy this one, drive it around
a while - it would be better than driving a honda - and trade up when
the right split comes along.
