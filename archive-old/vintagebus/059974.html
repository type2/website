Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Single Cab...friggin' shift rod!!!!

Rex,

I think you asked the question before about swapping a late shift rod into
an earlier bus. Someone posted a response that the later shift lever had a
pin that wouldn't fit into the earlier shift rod. Does this mean that you
could put a later shift rod in your truck if you used a later shifter?

| I will be needing to replace or somehow modify or make a main shift
| rod. It's for an earlier '59 Single Cab truck. Will one from a 60's
| split bus...say '65-'67 work? I know where some of those are and
| might could get one. Might get lucky and find an earlier one. But
| does anyone else have one?
|
| I figure the section of shift rod tube I pull out can be welded back
| in....or replaced with some properly sized pipe. The heater tube
| section I definatly can weld back in place.
|
| Comments and/or suggestions welcome.
