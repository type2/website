I had the same thing with my bus. I got some electrical contact cleaner from 
an electronics supply store, disassembled the switch and sprayed it 
repeatedly 
(10-15x). You will need to relube the switch afterwards. I just sprayed some 
gunk lubricant in mine but there's probably better options. maybe check with 
the folks at the electronic supply place. Also a good idea to clean all of 
your connections. 

when I've tried to p-mail you lately it bounces back.
