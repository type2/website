Hi All
I just spent 2 weeks in Mexico for La Carrera Panamerica.  The gas in all of
mexico is availiable in 87 and 92 octane grades.  Several of the race cars
ran the 87 all race with no problems.  The fuel we had to siphon out of our
car to feed other's cars always looked very clean with no gunk at all.  Plus
all the stations are full serve!  Make sure, however you fill up at every
station you see, you don't know when the next one will come along.  Also,
none of the pemex attendants took plastic--pesos only

have fun!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Greetings Fellow Bus Friends:
&gt;
&gt; For Thanksgiving, we are driving our '67 21DLX (1600DP) down to
&gt; San Felipe,
&gt; Baja, Mexico. This will be our first maiden voyage into Mexico with an Air
&gt; Cooled VW. My question is: I will need to use Mexican gas in my Bus. Is
&gt; octane booster advisable for use in my Bus? if yes, any
&gt; recommended brands?
&gt; Or, is there another type of fuel additive that some would advise? Or, is
&gt; just straight Mex gas acceptable? Or, Is there any tune tips before the
&gt; Trek? Or,. . .
&gt;
&gt; As always, Thanks for your time, I truly enjoy and appreciate
&gt; this resource!
&gt;
