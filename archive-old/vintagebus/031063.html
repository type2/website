Adrian,

I just completed this swap three weeks ago.

I started with the beam from a '69 bus, I stripped everything and removed
everything from it.
Got Bus Boys Albatross adjuster and installed it per their instructions.
Pressed in new bearings and seals into the beam.

then got the trailing arms, spindles, hubs, calipers etc from a '79 bus
Next step was to rebuild all the '79 stuff then install it onto the beam.
New bearings &amp; seals  in everything, new ball joints, new rubber for the sway bar,

new shock absorbers (3), new seals in the calipers, new brake pads, turned the
discs,
new steering bushings, new brake hoses, new master cylinder. Whew!  I think I
covered everything.

Had to fabricate a bracket for the brake servo to mount to the beam and weld it
into place.  Waited until the beam was in place and everything aligned before
welding the bracket in.

Disconnected everything and dropped the old beam off and wheeled it aside.

I cleaned up the area and painted it.

Once dry, I applied a little grease to the frame rails and the insides of the beam
mounting flanges.

Lowered the bus (Double Cab) onto the new beam, wiggled, adjusted and got the
holes to line up just right.  Got one bolt in on one side and then the other.
Then the remaining 6 went right in.

Next came the brake lines, vacuum line from the rear.  Don't forget the check
valve and make sure it points the correct direction.  I used a piece of 1/2&quot;
copper pipe to run from the rear to the front with some 1/2&quot; reinforced tubing to
make up the ends of the vacuum run.

The rest of the work is details.

Not counting the beam rebuild, the actual removal and installation took me about
16 hours working by myself.  It would sure help to have another set of hands for
the lifting.  I had the luxury of having the DC up on a lift and was able to raise
and lower it as needed rather than trying to lift the beam.

ONE IMPORTANT NOTE - make sure that everything is disconnected BEFORE removing the
old beam.  Especially the CLUTCH CABLE.  (yep, I missed that one and had to take a
die grinder and cut a perfectly good cable).

Regarding the '75 beam into the '66 bus, From what I can tell, the holes are
different enough that it requires redrilling, and maybe some welding of the frame
to acommodate the new hole locations.

With the adjusters, rebuilding the beam, the brakes and wheel rebuilding, it's a
BIT of a job to do it right.

Would I do it again???   I would in a minute.  The resulting braking power is
unbelievable.  Since I use the DC as a daily driver here in one of the most insane
traffic locals that you can drive in (SoCal) and I don't care to pack heat, the
only other option is defensive driving.  The stopping power is very nice.  The
side benefit is, my 16 yr old daughter is learning how to drive and the DC is one
of the practice vehicles.  I feel a little better knowing that she'll have a
little easer time applying the same braking power (as the well adjusted drums) and
more if she needs it.  Also, it does rain in SoCal once in a while.

My rear brakes are also from the '79, but that's another story.
