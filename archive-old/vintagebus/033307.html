&lt;&lt; My fiancee and I recently purchased a '66 split window.  Since then we have
been trying to sort through the many models of the bus.  My question is
actually pretty easy.  We haven't been able to figure out what the differences
between a combie and a microbus is.  We've seen pictures of both, and they
look fairly similar.   &gt;&gt;
   Actually they are all Microbuses. These buses where a stripped down version
for hauling passengers.  They had cardboard door panels and head liners.
   The next step up was the Std. Microbus.  These had real headliners and
covered door panels with chrome strips.
   The flag ship of the bus line was the Deluxe Microbus, these had all the
nifty Std. stuff plus a clock and bumper and belt line trim.  Not all Deluxe's
had sun roofs or sky lights.
   I'm sure there's a lot more to it, but this is sort of an &quot;at a glance&quot;
guide.  The other way to be sure as to what you have is to break down the ID
number.
       Peace, Love, and gotta go-my taco's are burning,
        Mr. Bubbble Headdd
