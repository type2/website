&lt;&lt; If you want to see good stuff about buses, join Neato or Limbo.  They
 have nice magazines that discuss nothing but our buses.  No bikinis,
 either! &gt;&gt;

If it had Bikinis i might join NeatO and get the little paperback issues

but then again. 

If VW Trends and Hot VWs had  cool Cars i might subscribe to those too.

VolksWorld is where its at.
FLAT 4 was good althougth they just changed the name of it and can't remember.
and VW custom classic  was pretty good when it was around.

but SUCKED when they sort of ended during a subscription.
