Hello all,  Well here in good old Ottumwa, Iowa. The home of Radar from
the tv show m.a.s.h. there aren't any splits but my 60. In fact whe I'm
out and about in town people look at me as if I was driving an alien
space craft. It is pretty funny the looks we get  and the pointing too.
But I know they're all really jealous deep down. There is a bay in town
but it doesn't move at all. I think it must be some sort of lawn
ornament. Yes, every drive is an adventure around here. It really is sad
so many people just don't know what they're missing. I mean how much fun
could driving a Pinto really be? I've seen a few of those in town. Boom!
So if you're ever in the area stop through town. The looks you'll get
alone would be worth the stop. Well take care all and enjoy those space
crafts! See Ya

Shawn
60 Deluxe
