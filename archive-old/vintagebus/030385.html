&gt; Last night I finally got my modified jacks so I can get the double cab
at
 least 40&quot; off the floor to more easily clean it.
 Check out the pic on vintagebus_dot_com under 'projects' or visit my web site!

Pretty neat but it strikes me as unsafe.  Maybe if the wheels of the stands
locked in place?

Can the jack points really support the complete weight like that (possible
dumb question)?  I just don't see anything to protect you if one corner
broke off or failed in some way.
