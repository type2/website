Subject: Hard Bleeding Brakes
Date: Thu, 27 Aug 1998 05:39:06 -0700

Been attempting to bleed brakes on my '67.
(dual circuit brake master cylinder)

Doing this single handed, but that's not the problem,
since I'm using a one-way valve very close to the
bleed nipple and running the hose up and over 
the tire to let gravity assist in getting bubbles away
from bleeder.

I noticed that if I push really hard on the pedal,
it gives gets really hard.  If I back off on the pressure,
I can get the pedal to move and continue bleeding.

I bled all wheels, checked adjustments &amp; all OK.
Sat in it last and tried brakes.  Pushing hard results
in stiff feeling brakes.  Letting off a little results in
brake pedal going down easily.  Pumping brakes
results in stiff brakes again.

What's happening to achieve this situation of
very hard brakes when pushing very hard, but
otherwise soggy brakes?
