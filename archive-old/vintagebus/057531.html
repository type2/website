Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

The proportioning valve adjusts the front/rear pressure ratio so that all
four wheels will lock up at pretty much the same time.  You can do without
it, but either the front or the rear will lock up first, reducing your
overall braking and control ability.  Baywindows have a porportioning
valve that adjusts with the deck angle of the bus, sending more braking to
the rear wheels when loaded.

&gt; Why does a dual circuit need a proportion valve ? That's a single circuit

&gt; BTW, the dual brake circuit in the manual for my 67 mysteriously left off
&gt; the proportioning unit in their diagram. Who do I write about this
&gt; potentially dangerous error?

&gt;   That's what I always felt. But by the time you buy the Brazilian 72 and
&gt; later master, the conversion spacer and a proportion valve, you'd be close
&gt; to the cost of a 67 master anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Ronnie    all statements are for the amusement of those that read it, just
&gt; my opinion.
&gt;
&gt; I guess it's time to go to my friends shop and have them calculate the
&gt; different pressures and how they come on. They do this on the off road cars
&gt; and have the formulas needed to do this. Again, it will take HARD numbers to
&gt; end the mystery, not just I did this, you did this, he did this theory.
&gt;
&gt; On another note, the later master conversion was dreamed up as a replacement
&gt; for the then UNAVAILABLE 67 only master (thus using the 72 and later so the
&gt; reservoir would fit) and not as a duel circuit replacement for any bus, it
&gt; just progressed that way.
&gt;
&gt;   On another, another note. When I did my friends 64 deluxe, we tried many
&gt; different masters on it trying to find a safe alternative to the 67 only.
&gt; This included 3 different type 1 masters. A 64 Porsche master and the 72 and
&gt; later bus, we even installed the antilock piston kits and proportioning
&gt; valves to try to get good smooth even braking. Our test track consisted of
&gt; hauling ass up and down the alley behind my shop and locking up the brakes.
&gt; This how we discovered what really happens. The antilock pistons did work
&gt; with the 72 master but had a slight spongy feeling in a panic. The 68 and up
&gt; bug worked but no matter how we adjusted and bleed the brakes the pedal was
&gt; real soft and with the antilock kit would go to the floor. After a few days
&gt; of doing this we installed a 67 only master ($250.00 dollars NOS) at that
&gt; time and had all braking problems solved.

&gt; Wouldn't a proportioning valve be required to balance the brakes
&gt; correctly with a different MC?

&gt; Tried the bug conversion and it works but makes for a real spongy pedal.
&gt; The best bet in my OPINION is to step up and buy the 67 master. CORRECT
&gt; part for a early bus. I am still not sold on putting a disc brake master
&gt; on a drum brake car. It doesn't work on dune buggys or bajas, so I still
&gt; can't figure out how it can work properly on a 4 drum brakle bus. On the
&gt; buggys it locks up the front brakes prematurely. The reason it doesn't
&gt; on the bus is probaly due to the weight, but what happens in a panic
&gt; stop on a slick road?
&gt;
&gt; ronnie   just my opinion

&gt; Thanks for the info.  What about using a 19.0mm Bug MC?  Should give
&gt; increased pressure at the brake pads?

&gt; &gt; &gt; According to the RMMW catalog, admittedly not as accurate as Bently
&gt; etc.,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 50-67(66?) bus MC has a 22.2mm bore.  Both the 211 611 021Q for
&gt; '68-'69
&gt; &gt; &gt; bus and the 211 611 021J for a '70 bus also have a 22.2mm bore and
&gt; &gt; &gt; are non-servo units.  Has anyone tried either of these?  The local
&gt; &gt; &gt; shop
&gt; doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; carry these in stock so I could not physically compare to see if the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; mounting is the same.  If someone could look at them and let me know
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; looks to be the best match I would be willing to try it out and
&gt; &gt; &gt; report.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You cannot use the 68-70 masters because you cannot get a reservoir
&gt; &gt; with a screw cap to fit them. The two holes are farther apart then the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 67 and 72+ masters. 68-70 is [if memory serves me] 100mm. All the
&gt; &gt; others, including
&gt; VW,
&gt; &gt; Mercedes, Volvo, are 85mm center-to-center.
&gt; &gt; Unless you used the upper reservoir, tube, and lower reservoir from 68
&gt;
&gt; &gt; [one-year-only set-up] or 69/70.....
