&gt;   The problem I have found with putting plywood on the roof rack is it
&gt; really affects the handling of the bus at 70 plus MPH, also I noticed that

&gt; drove to NM and have since removed the plywood. Going to Jerome with it
&gt; loaded and slower made no difference in the way it handled.

I don't get anywhere near 70, so that isn't a problem for me.  Crosswinds
seem to be a bit stiffer, but I've had the rack so long that it might just
be my imagination.

One other nice thing the plywood did was to quiet the rack down.  Before I
put the wood on it sounded like a pipe organ!

For the ham radio types, a rack is a great no-holes antenna platform.
Baywindow folks can run the wires through the air intakes to the rack.
