&lt;&lt;  I have, the carb idle ( bocar 34 pict 3) should be set before you time, 
and the timing should be set before you set the carb idle, Having just 
installed a new carb, and having poor timing, I need both. Which should I do 
first to obtain proper setting from the second?&gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
First make sure you carb is jetted for the type of air cleaner, muffler and 
even the engine compartment it is used in.  Then set the distributor at 5BTDC 
staticly.  Then follow our directions in the type 2 library for that carb to 
set the idle.  Followed by checking the timing with the engine while it is 
running to make sure the advance reaches at least 20BTDC _at_ 2,500RPM, and tops 
out at 28-30 BTDC at most.  Eric&amp;Barb
 
 &lt;&lt; My engine code is not in the idiot book(AB I think, it's not here to 
check), is it safe to assume that the two notches on the pully other than top 
dead center are 7.5 and 10 degrees btdc, or might they be atdc?  &gt;&gt;
Engine codes mean nothing if the distributor used is not stock for that 
engine number.  Never assume (Do you know what happens when you do?), get a 
junk aftermarket degree pulley to check your marks and even set a 180 mark on 
your stock pulley for more accurate and easier valve adjustments.  Eric&amp;Barb
