&gt; One trick suggested by &quot;No Quarter&quot;.  for dealing with rusted bolts, or 
&gt; whatever, is candle wax, heat up the part, apply the candle.

Hi Ttackman,
With threaded fasteners this is a good trick because the wax can and will 
work it's way in due to capilary action, lubricating the parts!  The problem 
with tapered fitted parts is there is a gass tight bond keeping them 
together!  The old roller bearing cranks are actually made of many segments 
tapered fitted to gether to allow removal &amp; replacement of the roller 
bearings.  Heating the spindle is a bad idea due to possibly anealing 
(softening) the part damaging it for future use!  

 Have you &gt; tried using a pickle fork?
&gt; 
The only problem with those is they almost always damage the tie rod end, 
especially the rubber boot on there.  The factory press out tool is like a 
C-clamp, but goes around the tie rod end allowing it to pop out..  We were 
fortunite to find one made in Brazil.  
  As for being concerned about a hammer bending the spindle arm.  We really 
doubt that using a standard hammer (Do not use a BFH or sledge hammer!) will 
bend it any amount more than hitting a pot hole will do.  But if you have two 
hammers at hand it couldn't hurt, and may force more impact into momentarly 
deforming the tapered fit hole.      Eric&amp;Barb
