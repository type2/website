Subject: Leak down test procedure/hints, trans q Tires turn TOO much?
Date: Tue, 8 May 2001 07:54:13 -0400

The only way to really check out this engine in the mystery 66 is to test it
out, and then choose to get a new one or go as is. PO claims its a less than
couple thousand mile 1600/1641? that he didn't build and purchased to
install in this bus. Little to no oil leaks, except for left valve cover.
I plan on compression test in the car, followed by leak down.
Is leak down best accomplished in the car? Is so, how do I trap motor?
I had planned on this not being possible, and planned to chain the engine to
a farme of 4x4s somehow (or flywheel lock?), but the chassis might be my
friend here.
What are acceptable values or variation between cyls?
Also, a faint noise is heard when my clutch is not depressed, and is silent
when it is. I accuse the trans of not having suffcient oil at this time (no
I don't drive her, but even so, could this be deeper, ala input bearing? If
it's not loud, and changing fluid helps, might this be drivable for some
time (i.e a year?) the gears are not noisy in motion, with the exception of
reverse, more chattery than the ghia, but not evil, and I still think she
needs an immediate 'transfusion' which is slated with engine removal and
these tests.
My motor is coming out either way, as I feel compression, leak down, and end
play should let me know alot, and I have heater boxes, exhaust, detailing,
engine bay painting, and wiring/fuel line checks to do anyway.

Also, my front wheels turn TOO much, hitting the fronts of the front
trailing links off the torsion bars, tire size is 195/75/14 on wide fives,
wolfgang lowered spindles, with new king/links? Is this an adjustment screw
up? I didn't so these mods or repairs, and am working my way front, so
haven't got into there yet, but am curious if any things to check
immediately.
Thanks,
Al
