Hi Scott,
If the clutch discs are the same diameter then you need to just change the 
clutch and pressure plate from the older 1500 engine to the newer engine.  If 
the clutch discs are differant sizes (180 or 200mm) you need to go out and 
best buy a nine spring clutch pressure plate and disc of 200mm size.  Also 
check the teeth of the older FW compared to the newer one.  If the teeth are 
differant the older 1500 FW is for use with a 6 volt starter motor, and if so 
you would be best getting a 6 volt 200mm FW (Last we heard Butch of Bear's VW 
machine in San Diego still had two reconditioned of these FWs for sale for 
$25.00 each!).  If you can not find one of these FWs you will have to install 
the later FW with the earlier style 200mm clutch parts.
