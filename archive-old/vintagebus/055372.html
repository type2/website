Subject: Re: [VB] Questions from a Groovy Dude

&gt;I have a '66 21 W Deluxe that needs middle and rear  seat seatbelts. How
can I attach them to the seats without drilling through the floor? I only
want the illusion of safety.
&gt;
Uh, ok.  You could U-bracket them to the legs of the seats, I guess.

Why do you &quot;need&quot; seatbelts?  State law? I know in CA, you don't have to
have seat belts if the car did not originally come equipped with them.
