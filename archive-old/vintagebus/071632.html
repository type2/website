Subject: Re: [VB] Rear facing lights

The PO of my 58 panel had installed a set of trailer lights in place of the
standard tail lights.  I guess they were &quot;gone&quot; when he got it.  I thought
about replacing them, but they are VERY bright.  So I think I might leave
them for a bit.  The housing mounts inside the reactor compartment, so you
really can't tell they are not stock (except for the cheesy lenses).
