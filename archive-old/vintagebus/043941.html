Roger, I'd be willing to bet you have never had your house ripped off or
one of your vehicles stolen, never to be seen again.
Some of us feel like these vehicles are our children.  What more important
things are there to worry about than our children?

&gt; My attitude towards the whole thing is that in the end, the vehicle is a
&gt; thing, an object. One associated with memories and experiences, mind you,
&gt; but all in all a thing that can be eventually replaced.  There are a lot
&gt; more important things to worry about than to spend countless hours and
&gt; sleepless nights wondering if your vehicle is still sitting outside your
&gt; house.
