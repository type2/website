I have a set of 165R15 86T Kelly metric radials on my '67. They've been on
there for the past nine years and have about 20K on them. Still have alot of
tread (around 90%) left on them. I don't know how close they are to what was
stock (14&quot;) but the speedo is very accurate (verified by distances on trips
and those signs cops set up that shows your speed). I'm sure they aren't
rated for LT but they work great and have hauled some serious cargo. I keep
the rear pumped up to the rated max and the front 5psi less. I would buy
them again if they ever wear out!

&gt; Good day bus people -
&gt; I can't seem to find much in the archives regarding recommended and
&gt; available tires for the 15&quot; rims. Is there anyone out there riding
&gt; around on appropriate tires they are well pleased with and would buy
&gt; again? This bus is transportation, not a show car, so it doesn't have
&gt; to be stock.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
