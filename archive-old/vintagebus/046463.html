Subject: Re: [VB] Dangerous Brakes!


I always take apart and inspect these parts, wheel cylinders, MCs etc before 
installing.  I once found an NOS brake wheel cylinder (for the barndoor I 
think it was) with part of the innards missing.  New in the box.   also 
indian wheel cylinders I was offered once at a store, the innards were the 
wrong size, give me that good brasilian stuff I said.   I have had the guy at 
the counter get annoyed that I was taking it apart right there in front of 
him, but hey, I gotta know.

hope you dont mind I am cross posting this to the list, as I think it is a 
good safety tip.

 Hi Clara, thanks for your response on the brakes.  I posted the question on 
brake failure to the list so that early bus/bug drivers would think about the 
condition of their single circuit brake system.  Mine was one year old and I 
have found a piece of the rubber 'cup' had torn(?).  The piston had not 
&quot;popped&quot; out of the cyl.  Duel circuit mc is on order and new rear wheel cyls.
   Thanks again,
        Lou  &gt;&gt;
