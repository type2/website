Subject: stolen bus in AZ

A good friend and ex-roommate of mine had his bus stolen in
Scottsdale, AZ last night.  The VIN is 216030018 and he put some
pics up on thesamba_dot_com in the stolen directory of the gallery.  He
lives here in Atlanta but he has been letting his mother drive his bus
back in AZ for the last few years.

The bus is ugly and rusty, but it is the bus he thought he would
always own and it has a LOT of sentimental value to him.  If those
of you in the southwest have any leads for him, his name is Ted
Morris, his email is vwsrock_66bus_at_yahoo_dot_com and his phone
number is (404) 375-1932.

He is flying out to Phoenix tomorrow night, but that number is his cell.
Any leads to help a real bus guy get his baby back would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave Easterwood
Bus Driver
