Hey Matthew,
Sorry, don't know about the tags....
Do know that there was a leg at some point. There is a pic _at_ Thom's site...
I've got a ladder for my rack (sloped 13 slat) and can tell you that I 
wouldn't hop on it in fear of bending the aluminum... It will sit fine on the 
rear of the bus, but mine sits kinda funny on the sides because it is 
sloped...
I have a later rack too, but it's just been hanging out on the garage floor 
waiting for installment at a later time:)
Both are restored, but I don't have tags yet... 
Good luck,
Pete
