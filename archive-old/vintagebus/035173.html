It's hard for a Bus to run with &quot;1600DP motor complete not installed condition

unknown&quot;.  :)


I always assume &quot;condition unknown&quot; means it is blown or frozen, any other

condition is a nice surprise.


Jeez, how can anyone complain about a bullet-nose 15-window for $2k?!?

sounds interesting- what year is it?   I love those bullet nose 15 windows.  

silly whiner, read the ad.  (I haven't.   No colour screen now, cannot look 
at color pictures)

though I understand with a sight unseen bus or part it is hard to get a full 
understanding of it. But  if the ad says the engine is not installed, 
condition unknown, it is not  fair to assume the bus is a daily driver.   
Call it battery not included, some assembly required.

people DO get excited about getting a bus, and the potential buyer may have 
buildt a prettier mental picture than was called for.
