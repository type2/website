Hi, you wrote:

        My name is Michael Hathaway. I have been on the list for awhile
but this is my first time to post since leaving the list last year. My
question is how hard is it to replace a steering gear box on a 1963
single cab and were is a good place to get a steering gear box? Any
input would be greatly appreciated.

it's kinda a PITA.  The big deal is removing the steering wheel without
messing it up.  Remove the horn button, uncrew the horn button wire or cut it
off with some space if the screw is toast.   Undo the big nut holding the
wheel on.   Push the horn wire down the column and  I use a propane torch to
heat up the around the wheel goes on the shaft aternated with squirting cold
water on it to shock it.  The end of the shaft tapes.  I screw the nut on
flush to the top of the clum and whack it with a big hammer.   Some people
whack upwards with a big hammer onto wood to knock the wheel up, but this has
an irritating habit of breaking the stuff off the steering wheel.     I am
sure someone has the perfect tool and hides it, cackling and laughing at the
thought of the frustrating this can cause.   Once the steering wheel is off
(you ave it on ramps or over a curb already I hope) undo the plate that holds
it to the dash tray.   Under the bus take the drag link off the pitman arm.
Unplug the horn wire.  Unscrew the bolts holding the box on (these tend to be
easy as there is usually oil there from the box leaking)   Slide it down out
of the bus.  Voila!!    Easier to install.   An afternoon I'd say. Pictures
and instructions in the Bentley reprint.   A little more work if you have a
steering lock, as the lock must come off in that case.    I got a rebuildt
column from Wolfsgang in Redding which feels nice but haven't installed it
yet.   I want to put a steering lock in my 61, and I don't want to mess with
the steering wheel twice but I don't have a steering lock for it but the box
in the bus is worn and clunks alarmingly sometimes.   I should get off my
hiney and just go do it.
