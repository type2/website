Subject: Re: [VB] Drop 12 v to 6v help needed
Mime-Version: 1.0

 From my experience converting my '64 SC to 12v,

1.  The 6v gas gauge will NOT give a correct reading if run on 12v.  Other 
on the list can give a huge dissertaion on the proper way to drop the 
voltage to it.  I lucked out and scored a '67 12v guage.

2.  Any standard 2-wire flasher relay will work. There are 3 wires going to 
the current relay, one of which is for the indicator.  Attach the other two 
to the 2 terminals on the new relay and the indicator to whichever side 
makes it flash.  Worked for me...

&gt;If anyone can be of assistance certainly would appreciate a bit of
&gt;instruction.  Am converting a 1964 Kombi to 12 volt, have changed all
&gt;the bulbs, dropped down my Saphire FM/AM with a drop down resister,
&gt;dropped down the Heater blower on the same resister.  Now am
&gt;experiencing a bit of difficulty on two items.  First, does the 6V gas
&gt;gauge need to be dropped down from the 12v or will it work fine with 12V
&gt;even though it was originally 6V?  Secondly, am having trouble getting
&gt;the 12V flasher hooked up correctly.  Anyone done this and willing to
&gt;give me a bit of assistance.  Not too stupid, just unfamiliar with the
&gt;bunch of wires since the emergency flasher was removed and am uncertain
&gt;how to proceed.
&gt;
&gt;The wiring diagrams I've seen don't seem to be much help with wire
&gt;colors, locations etc.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
