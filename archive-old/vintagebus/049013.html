What about glueing a few thin strips of metal, like 18-20 gauge sheetmetal with the proper line.  I think I'm going to try this on the '59 Westy unless I realize something I don't already know, on top of Thompsens, paint, etc.

The DC rear piece is impossible to keep up from warping.  It has a life of 3 months, tops.
