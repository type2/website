 If you don't have the luxury of a free fix like Ellis here is a easy cheap
way that will only take about 15 mins. to fix and no pulling the eng. and
trans.  With trans in neutral, and shifter removed, cut shift rod about 15&quot;
behind shifter socket and twist shift rod left and right until you find its
middle of play, then have a friend hold the shifter socket from above in the
center of the hole in floor pan and weld shift rod back together. If you
have ever shortened or lengthened a buggy shifter this is the same way they
are done. I did this on the Binz and after many thousands of miles it is
still shifting great, so says Ross the new owner. Any ??? email me.
