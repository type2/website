&lt;&lt;  Is this comparable to a freeway flier? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
Could be, but you will never know unless you tach it.

&lt;&lt;Also how can I get my speedo corrected without going to stock size tires? 
&gt;&gt;  You would have to talk to a speedo shop about that.  If they have the 
right parts that will fit they will have to replace gears inside the speedo.
