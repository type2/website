Subject: Unearthed a treasure (long)...

I was over at Matt 'n Katies house this Sunday, working down through the 
patchwork quilt of bad paint and found something that I thought was both 
exciting and intriguing. Under the top layer of white paint, we found a 
dealer sticker above the left rear taillight. Switching from sandpaper to a 
softer Scotch-Brite (TM) pad, Matt was able to determine that it was from 
Auslander in New Hyde Park, NY. The M-code tells me that the panel came in 
through New Orleans, but I think (due to some unrelated info) that it was 
owned by this Auslander dealer for a number of years before it came out 
west.

With this discovery, he disallowed me to continue the sanding process so 
that we could research this bit of history. Here is the photo:

We wrapped up for the day and I hit the sack, eager to begin my research. I 
made three phone calls this morning and got some great progress.

The first call was to VWoA and they had no record of the dealer, nor were 
they very excited about helping out. Big surprise there. I asked about a 
dealer-relations department and was told that none existed. Hmm, I sensed 
futility and rang off from the super-friendly Amy.

The second call was to good ol' 411. I asked for anything with VW in the 
name in New Hyde Park and unfortunately there was only one listed. I didn't 
know what Volkswagen GC was, but I decided to give it a try.

The last call was the gold mine. I called VW GC and talked to Martha, the 
receptionist. She was helpful and friendly, but seemed swamped. It was 
indeed a dealership and she had been there for 18 years. Apparently, &quot;GC&quot; 
was the new franchise purchased from Auslander! I started babbling my story 
and she began to wane. &quot;Just a minute, sir&quot; and she put me on hold.

I figured it was over, but a gravelly-sounding older guy named John picked 
up the phone. Apparently he was the service manager and had been there 28 
years. He was familiar with the previous ownership, but was pretty confident 
that there wasn't any boxes of goodies stashed anywhere full of Auslander 
gold. He went on to say that he had an &quot;old timer&quot; working for him and that 
he had been there in the Auslander days and was a real vintage nut. He told 
me to call back tomorrow (the guy works Tues-Sat) and he would pull him off 
the bay to talk to me. He also said that the current owner could be 
&quot;difficult to work with&quot; (my words, not his), but that he would bring it up 
to him and see if any historical data, files, etc. exist.

After thanking him profusely, I was getting ready to sign off when he threw 
another shot across the bow. Apparently, there was an area service rep (Hans 
somethingorother) that was really involved with the dealership. He is 
retired now, but lives in San Diego. I'm going to try and track him down 
too. Phew, not bad for the first day!

If anyone knows *ANYTHING* about this dealer, I am eager to hear from you. 
Ultimately, I would like to find another sticker like the one pictured, 
plate frames, dealer literature, vehicle history, etc. to create a little 
info packet for the panel.
