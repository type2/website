Hi Paul,
We not only carry all those parts, but tools also.  Have you gone deep into 
Nevada, Montana, Idaho, or other areas like those?  Lots, and lots of 
nowhere.  Got a cell phone?  Great now how do you get home on a three day 
weekend when you will have to sit and wait until the part/s are shipped in?  
If you are ever in the NW of USA we would be happy to show you how well this 
stuff stores.  While still having plenty of room for both of us and Gasket 
the cat in our 1960 panel camper conversion van.  Which we have done up to a 
length of three weeks.  If you really have problems storing stuff in your bus 
then you always could try the Jack Maynard padlocked wood storage box bolted 
to the roof rack.
  What you drive only in civilized areas?  Well last year a friend of ours 
burned up a front wheel bearing.  Since he had a cell phone he got towed to 
the local VW dealership which happened to be closed due to it being late 
Saturady on Labor day weekend in N. Cal.  Result, had to wait at a motel for 
three days to get it fixed.  Eric&amp;Barb
