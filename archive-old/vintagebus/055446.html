Subject: RE: [VB] original-style Pedal Pads

Interesting.... of course it's typical to come to the conclusion that there
is more than one answer.  The one thing I do know is that you can date the
parts to specific periods sometimes if it has the VW/Audi symbols both on it
or just the VW...  I have purchased 4 accelerator pedal bellows (!) (the one
that fit on the floor) in search of a *correct* one.  What I found is one
with the 211xxxxxx number on it and no insignias, one with a VW 211xxxxxx,
one with a VW/Audi symbol 211xxxxxxx, and the other has the VW/Audi symbol
211xxxxxx but it's different than the other.  I would consider the VW
211xxxxxx part number an original as I bought it in a pile of parts from an
old dealers stock.  The funny thing about it is I pulled the remnants of one
out of a 62 that had been sitting for ever and it has NO number or insignias
on it.

By the way, just so others don't get burned, I bought the one with just the
211xxxxxx number on it from a place in England called Status VW and it is
total junk.  They also claimed to have German rear deck seals which ended up
being Brazilian crap... so buyer beware!!!

... and if you have read this far...

In my 63-67 parts book, the pads are the 111 part number I quoted.
Compare the two parts side-by-side and the 111 pad is just larger enough
to make a difference in fit.  Wonder why VW would go to the trouble of
making such a change?
