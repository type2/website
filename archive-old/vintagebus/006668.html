It' expensive, just have it shipped air frieght (3 Days) but then you will
have to go to the airport terminal to pick it up, pay duty and clear
customs, or have it shipped parcel post, 4-8 weeks to recieve. I don't know
what items your recieving,  just have the box labled as used parts and be
discriptive as to the  contents. I had a parcel returned from England
because I didn't break down the contents of the package and Just got another
back from Canada because the discription wasn't detailed enough, BOMB scares
I guess.
