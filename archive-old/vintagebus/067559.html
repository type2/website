Subject: Gas heater deal and New Email Identity

Hey folks, I hate to use up bandwidth with this post but I am trying to reach a couple of people who I have been working with to buy a couple of gas heaters.  Earthlink has been messing up my email account and I have not been able to send or receive email for nearly a week (I don't even know if this message is coming through), so I am dropping them and re-subscribing under the new email address of harmony_at_buszen_dot_com
In the process I have lost the names and emails of the two guys I had committed to buying heaters from, so If it was you, please contact me at the new address.
This will be the last post I send from this email account as I am un-subcribing right now.
Peace, John Baker
