&gt;
&gt; What I had planned on doing was pop-riviting them into place. But I got to
&gt; thinking, why not just nut, lockwasher, and bolt them? Seems like it'd be
&gt; easier to replace broken ones this way. I've got all the hardware already
&gt; to do it. I've attatched one that way and can't find a reason not to do
it.
&gt; About all I could think of is build-up of dirt and debris making it a
&gt; little rough to remove the nut.

If memory serves, the bolt heads, or nuts, will interfere with mounting the
wheel on the drum. When you tighten the lug bolts, you will distort the
wheel. I may be wrong (it happened once), but I recall having this problem
when the rivets were not fully flattened.
