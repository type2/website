Subject: Re: [VB] fan width

Hi Mike,
If the inside of the fanshroud was that dirty, how is the rest of the engine? 
 If the engine has gone beyond 30,000 miles and is not CW and has been 
missing flaps, it is a must to strip the engine down to a longblock.  So you can 
clean all the cylinder/head fins out and retorque all the engine case/head 
fasteners.  
  You can use a smaller earlier fan belt for more RPM by having the belt ride 
lower in the upper pulley to the point we had to have 12 shims inbetween the 
pulley halfs instead of the stock eight shims, but that turned out for us to 
be only about 1.8:1 ratio.  With the Porsche upper pulley we have been able to 
get 2.2:1 and higher with differant length belts.  
  We have run the type 4 cooler in modified doghouse shroud and for us it 
really helped to keep the engine temp in hot weather more stable.  Still one can 
not just floor it and ignore it and not have the engine oil temp shot way up!
