Subject: Barndoor wheel cylinder rebuild kits found
Mime-Version: 1.0

I picked up the front wheel cylinder rebuild kits this morning.  The local 
NAPA actually got them for me (I couldn't believe it, they had listings 
for them all the way back to 1950).

For you Barndoor owners, NAPA's part number for them is 513 and they cost 
a little over $5 per kit.  Made in USA, fresh stock (nice &amp; pliable), 
comes with 2 cups, 2 dust seals, spring, &amp; a capsule of brake assembly 
grease.

Looks like I'll be driving back cross country with front brakes (who-hoo!).

Now I just have to decide whether to take the 40hp stale air engine I just 
built, or see if I can find a 6v 200mm o-ring flywheel and a '73 Thing fan 
shroud to drive it back with a 1600 I just built.

Anybody out there have either of those 2 items?

Dave
