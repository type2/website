Subject: RE:'not for sale; it's just for display!'  (was Paint
  availability)

HEY!!

I find absolutely nothing wrong with that. (Guilty as charged)

People set up their tents, tow their single wheels trailers, display their
special camper accessories and those are 'not for sale; it's just for
display!'

Granted the setting in a swap ins't the best place to display your cool rare
parts, but heck, where else are you gonna display them and still keep an eye
on them????

There are a number of other reasons, too.

--Get attention to your swap area.
--Find info on the item.
--Share a story about the item
--Share the story on how you scored a part for super cheap.
--Show people that parts even exist!
--Screw with people.
--Try to get outrageuos prices.
--Show off.

Ideally, I want to put on a show where people just show off the Rarest of
the Rare stuff, I think that would be cool.....

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

My favorite ones are the guys who put out stuff and
then say it's not for sale; it's just for display! I
couldn't help but make a comment on that one.
