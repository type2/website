It is welded on!  so you would need to cut one out of a junk bus and weld
that in.

But... you cant have the heat log AND a camper bed... since you have a 21
i doubt you will put a bed in, but if you might want one, i'd go ahead and
wait on that repair until you are sure that you wont want one...

Can too!  I have a bay Z bed in my 61 deluxe.  I cut a hole in the bottom 
flat piece of wood for the z bed, and left the door to that area off.      Of 
course, the bus doesn't drive now, but I did drive it like that for over a 
ayear, even with heat on.
