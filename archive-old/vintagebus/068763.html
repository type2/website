Subject: Re: [VB] new bus questions

Slammed to me is anything lower than 3.5&quot;.  Basically a bus that has been 
made to sit very low and cut grass with the front bumper.  Usually with the 
use of air bags to raise and lower the bus.  But the front beam needs 
trimmed drastically to achieve this movement.  I have no clue what happens 
in the rear.

Not sure if that is much help or a great description though.  Check out BET 
monster rap videos and you will see all sorts of slammed cars of all types.

Later,
Adrian

&gt;Slammed busses are very diffilult to build and do right.
&gt;--------------------- Clip --------------------------
&gt;What do you mean by slammed busses.
&gt;It is a new term to me.
&gt;My guesses are:
&gt;Lowered busses.
&gt;Chopped up modified busses.
