Great to hear you say that,Ronnie.I have been laboring over which filter to use
in my 60 Westy and just bought and recieved the C-B Perf. mini sump/filter  and
was impressed with how well it was designed. I couldn't see placing a filter
right next to the header,which is where the pump filter ends up.The mini sump
seemed like the simpliest easiet solution.
I'm glad to hear you like it! It's funny but I never had heard anybody talk
(good or bad) about these sumps/filters ,so I was a little unsure whether to
buy one($59.95).It seems worth every penny.

&gt; in my opinion i would use the CB Performance mini sump with cleanable

&gt; amazing the cr_at_p that it catchs. On my brand new VW factory 1600 in my
&gt; double door i have a pump filter, (genuine VW factory piece) as comes on the
&gt; new Mexican Type 1 beetles. Ronnie  Old Volks Home of Az.
