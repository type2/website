Subject: Sighting: Cool VB t-shirts in PHX airport

On my way out of PHX last week I found a really nice t-shirt with a
bunch of Kokopelli dudes traveling in a splitty bus -- thought you
Phoenicians might be interested.  I thought the artwork was very nice -
the bus is detailed in a cartoony way and the attitude of the art is
jaunty and fun.  Woulda bought one for myself but they didn't have XL
(brought a large one home for the SO though).

This was in a souvenir kiosk on the left just before you go through the
security scanners, in whichever terminal USAirway flies out of.

If any of you guys get over there and they have any in XL, please grab
me one.
