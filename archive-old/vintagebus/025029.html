&gt;           I'm seeking info on possible tents for a Single Cab.  I guess
&gt;a tilt would work but access climbing in and out would be a pain.  Ideas
&gt;are welcomed.

Neat idea.  Do you mean a tent for the bed (like those canvas covers) or
a side/rear tent?

What's a tilt?

You might could hang an awning-type tent or screen-room off the side
&gt;from the *frame* of one of those canvas cover things, or something like
that.  Hmmm.... Or you could adapt a &quot;foyer&quot; tent to the pasenger side
door. :-)
