Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet Metal for 65' bus- more questions 

well, you know how people bitch and moan.  

FWIW the WW rocker repair pieces seem good.  MOPBO.  Do ask questions on the 
list and or look in the archives.   Dunnno why the heater tube should be 
expensive, its just a freakin tube, but its METRIC   hahaha.  Bet someone has 
that under the floor piece and is email to offer it to you for not much more 
than shipping.

Hope the resto goes well

 Hi! New guy on the list (reactivated '67 13-window Deluxe in Phila. Pa.
 area)...
 
 I was distressed to read the negative reports on body panel quality, since I
 just made the commitment to fix the body right. Lots of questions: Is it the
 whole group's concensus that BFY's panels are best? What variety does The
 Bus Depot sell (they're local for me, but seem more focused on later buses)?
 Schofield in the U.K. seems to offer pieces that the others do not -- does
 he sell to the U.S.? It seems only RMMW offers a heater tube in the U.S.,
 but it's only 36&quot; long and very expensive -- what's the deal? (I need the
 whole straight tube, plus the angled piece just ahead of it that comes down
 from over the front beam.) &gt;&gt;
