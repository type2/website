    dunno... he bought a drivetrain off of ebay? NOS, from a source in
Tibet?
    built w/genuine next-day-air-$hipped Berg parts?
    perhaps we're missing a decimal place somewhere.
    or maybe the mechanic's just well-paid.
    if labor approximates parts... that's $4k labor.
    conservative labor rate of $40/hr gives us 100 hours... the labor guide
time for a complete engine rebuild is _at_ 20 hours. Doing a class A job of it
is more like 40... considering the things we should do now that we didn't
know about back then.
    So, 40 for the tranny... 60 for the rest of it. tranny, everything...
blueprinted &amp; balanced, full-flowed, counterweighted, electronic
ignition-ed, sand sealed, alternator-ed, gold-plated thermostat &amp; flaps,
etcetera...
    for that much, one could buy all the jigs &amp; special tools out of the
Baum Tool$ Catalog and still come out ahead on the tranny work, IMHO.
    BTW, for anyone interested in the $8K drivetrain special... I am
graduating on the 17th and will be available for hire ;)

thanks...

&gt;What can you do to a drivetrain to spend that kind of money? New engine,
&gt;new transaxle, all new reduction box bearings, then do it all agian?
&gt;Or am I missing something?
