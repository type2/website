Does anyone subscribe to John Muir's method for unplugging a heat
riser?  That is heat the carbon with an oxy-acetylene torch until it
starts to glow then switch to oxygen only.  Anyone know how well this
works?

&gt;I Think my heat risers are plugged on my Single Port intake manifold.
&gt;
&gt;This being my first SP, i thought i'd ask... can you remove the 
&gt;intake
&gt;manifold without pulling the engine? (not a big deal either way, i'd 
&gt;just
&gt;like to budget my time appropriately and not bother trying to remove 
&gt;it
&gt;in-situ if it is impossible)
&gt; - -- - - 
&gt;you can remove the muffler and try to clean out the heat riser with 
&gt;a drill 
&gt;till the corners, then a clutch cable past the crners (use drill in 
&gt;reverse 
&gt;so you dont break off the wires).   Yes you can remove the manifold 
&gt;w/o 
&gt;pulling the motors, but I am not sure if that is easier than pulling 
&gt;it.
