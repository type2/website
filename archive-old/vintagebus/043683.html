&gt;In my 66 camper, on the &quot;collar&quot; that goes around the speedo and connects 
&gt;to the steering column, There is a small little switch.  It is almost like
&gt;a little miniature light switch.  What the heck is this for??

Secret Luftwaffe call button.  Actually it's probably for turning on 
the dome light back over the middle seat.  The idea seemed to be that
the driver could reach up and turn on the one on the end of the fresh
air vent, but couldn't reach the one in the back - hence the switch.
It should have a hot wire from the dash and a wire that runs up in
the roof to the light.

&gt;Also I By-passed the 9 prong box and installed a flasher on this bus 
&gt;to try to get brake light &amp; turn signals.  I followed Matt Roberts'
&gt;directions in the type2_dot_com library and it worked, I now have brake
&gt;lights and turn signals (Thanks Matt!)

You're welcome!

&gt;However, when the ignition is OFF, the turn signal indicator light 
&gt;in the speeo stays ON.

What may be happening is that the flasher leaks enough voltage
and the indicator finds enough of a ground (through the coil and
other stuff on circuit 15) that it glows.  I'm guessing that you
used a two-terminal flasher; a three-terminal one may be less
susceptible to this.

Or, you might try unplugging the (formerly connected to the 9-prong 
box) red wire (#30) from X on the flasher and plugging the (formerly
connected to the 9-prong box) black wire (#15) into X on the flasher.
This is the black wire coming off the ignition fuse that is marked 
as &quot;nc&quot; on Figure 2 of the 9-prong box write-up.  This makes the
flasher (and turn signals) only work with the key on, and should fix
your problem.

I hope this helps!
