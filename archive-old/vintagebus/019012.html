It's a barndoor cargo door latch &amp; lock; specifically for a deluxe, being chrome,
like the one I need for mine.

&gt; I believe he is asking about the use of them. Everyone knows there for the 
&gt; cargo doors. Take a look again, they have a wierd key placement, ratcher than 
&gt; the lock mechanism being in the handle itself, it has one where the &quot;flip 
&gt; interior lock&quot; would be.

&gt; &lt;&lt; it is for the cargo doors- those mechanisms move up and down to secure the
&gt;  metal &quot;rods&quot; in the hole above and below the door to lock the door. i would
&gt;  have to look up the part # to see what year they are correct for
