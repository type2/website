Subject: Fw: [VB] First Friday Post (Personal Attack from Steve Bradley Auto Body)

Before reading this long email, I want everyone to know, that this is for
information purposes only, and I WILL NOT respond on the list because I do
not want to clog the Vintage Bus List .  This is a non BUS POST, and so I
caution you before reading. If you feel this is not correct please email me
OFF the list at: type2_at_thebugbox_dot_com or email Steve Bradley at:
scscomp_at_bellsouth_dot_net to confirm this.  If he has any morals, he will admit
to doing these actions.

I hate to have to do this, but for anyone thinking about getting any work
done from Steve Bradley Auto Body, you need to read this:

1st post: This is what I posted

[Myself] [Subject: First Friday Post
http://www.shag-art_dot_com/Dangerouswomen/Departed.html
Ok, found this, thought it was cool. Finally, something to give on Friday.]

2nd: Steve Bradley then threw the first stone out to the list:

{Steve Bradley}{Dude! What have you been smoking?  It's Saturday?
Steve Bradley
Bradley Auto Body}

3rd: I replied off the list because my post was indeed on Friday and it was
my first Friday post ever, this was my reply:

[Myself] [Right click the message, go to properties, and read the date that
the
message was sent. Oh, I'm sorry, it says Friday.  Get off the horse, some
people don't live next door to you, and have different time zones.]

4th:  This was his reply, and another attack, and nowhere in my first email
did I say &quot;The&quot; First Friday Post (oh, and he misspelled hemisphere just
like you see it).

{Steve Bradley}{&quot;First&quot;, as in sent before any other posts of that date.
Do you care to explain to me how your post (sent at 23:28 Eastern Daylight
Time on 2/20/2002, a
Friday) could have been the &quot;First Friday Post&quot;, in any time zone, anywhere
in the known universe?
And oh, FYI, the date in the Eastern hemisphere is one day later than the
Western hemishpere at the International Date Line, not the previous day.
They apparently don't teach that in the schools you attended in your
country.}

5th: By this time, yes, I'm upset, and I'm starting to think this guy rides
the short bus to school (no VW pun intended) so I reply:

[Myself] [As in MY FIRST FRIDAY POST EVER dumbass. and yes 23:28 on 2/20 is
still a
friday. So please, shut up.  Thank you drive through.]

6th: Now he wants me OFF the list even though the only thing I did to the
list, was the original post, and did not forward any of my emails to the
list until now.  And I really like the trashy art comment, this guy Shag,
obviously is making a small fortune doing this stuff LOL. Read for yourself:

{Steve Bradley} {OK, I'll make a deal with you. If you unsubscribe from the
list and promise never to send moronic emails with links to trashy art to
anyone, ever again, I won't send you any more emails. How does that sound?}


So, here we are.  I appologize for the long drawn out email, and no bus
content, but I wanted to let everyone know how he treats people, and I hope
that he does not treat his customers like this.  So, once again, I'm sorry
for the Jerry Springer story I present you, and urge that people keep their
Stone throwing OFF of the list.  Just because you don't understand the
email, does not give you the right to start accusing people of &quot;SMOKING&quot;
something, or any other ignorant post. So please, consider what you are
doing when you finally click the SEND button out to hundreds (probably
thousands) of people, especially if it is to put down someone.
