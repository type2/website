Subject: ebay insanity

hey hey
while perusing ebay tonight...I came across this odd creature.  I think
this is worthy of mentioning on this list as it is so *unusual*...
someone actually stuck all of this into a bus!  I'd drive this thing any
day.  Look at that dash even!  It almost looks like a semi's dash.  I'd
love to see some of the other pictures...
