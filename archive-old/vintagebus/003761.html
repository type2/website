Yep BBotBR.  Busses Briefly on the Blue Ridge

OK folks, still wondering if DC area types want to form up on the way down
to the list campout a couple weekends hence.  I have a nice scenic thought
if anyone is interested.

I figure meet up Friday (time TBD) on I66 at Front Royal VA, proceed over
and down I81 to Staunton, then I64 till we hit the Blue Ridge Parkway to
keep a bit of the spirit alive, Blue Ridge down to US 501, US 501 to US29 at
Lynchburg, then US29 all the way down to Greensboro.  The treck I've laid
out there is roughly 300 miles give or take, so say 5 hours plus even if we
hump it pretty good, obviously depending on the slowest (lead) Bus (or
diesel Vanagon perhaps)

This means obviously we need to be starting out as early as possible and or
reasonable.  I can hit the area by about 3 pm myself which puts most of the
more scenic Blue Ridge trip still in the afternoon into evening.  I can in
fact ditch class and start out on Thursday or as early Friday as possible if
there more early trekkers, but assuming most people in DC working friday, I
think if we got out of Front Royal no later than 5-6ish it is still a doable
trip with some scenic value, maybe a striking sunset on the Blue Ridge
followed by harrowing night driving.  Else there is always straight down I81
to US220 and down, faster and shorter perhaps.

Anyone interested, please give me a yell, not many DC area types have spoken
yet, and we should have a strong presence.  As usual everyone welcome, I
understand we may even have an (egad) diesel Mercedes on our midst.  Anyway,
come Split, come Bay, come Vanagon, come EV.

Of course Chris has the standard camping info up at.

A final aside, there is strong rumour that a certain lazy listmaster wants
to spend the weekend installing and gloating over the new MS Stage 2 engine
for his (ugh) Vanagon, however all are encouraged to chastise him for this
thought, and notice is hereby served the exhaust system for said Vanagon is
being held hostage only to be delivered at this campout.
