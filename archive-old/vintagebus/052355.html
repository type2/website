Subject: Re: [VB] swing lever shaft bushing

I know what you mean. I blew the rear diff out of my
Patrol Saturday on I80 near Colfax and the driver made
my two friends ride in the truck while it was on the
flatbed! To Davis, CA! I have a feeling thats not very
legal....

&gt; Anything's possible, but more likely I'd question
&gt; how the bus was towed - 
&gt; I've seen tow truck operators do some lame stuff.  
&gt; I had the 911 towed one time,
&gt; and the yahoo tried to tie it down by throwing a
&gt; chain over the muffler!

&gt; &gt; I had a blow out on the interstate traveling about

&gt; &gt; towed to replace the tire the steering has become
&gt; very tight.  The last time
&gt; &gt; I had this symptom, it turned out the swing lever
&gt; pin/bushings had to be
&gt; &gt; replaced.  Can a blow out create enough torque to
&gt; bend the swing lever pin?
&gt; &gt; All the tie rods look straight nad the ends look
&gt; ok.  Any help you could be
&gt; &gt; would be appreciated.
