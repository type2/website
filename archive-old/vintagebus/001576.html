&gt;&gt;I guess ebay is good for the folks in rural areas.

You got it!  While living out in the sticks, you can find your typical bus
in the junk yard but it will never have the rare part you really need.  So,
ebay and places like VW planet are THE place to find stuff save from going
to a show now and again.  I figure that you can pay double sometimes on ebay
for the same part you can find at a swap but not being able to attend many
swaps, double priced is better than not having it at all.

I also extend my hearty thanks to all those that routinely post parts for
sale on this list and vw planet (and others) and to those that reply to
desperate pleas on this list for the part that you're looking for.  My 59
double cab has been on jack stands for over 2 1/2 years while I've been
looking for all the parts and I'm almost there  (still looking for a front
piece of the shift rod) !!:-)  Next March or April it will finally see the
light of day again.
