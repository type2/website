CAn anyone tell me how to distinguish an early bus beam from a late beam?
Are they _totally_ different?  If 68-69 beams bolt right up, are they
identical to 65-67 (except for the ball joints)?  My dilema is that I'm
buying a beam (complete - disc brake hub to hub) from a friend of a friend,
long distance.  The beam is described as being purchased for a 67 bus (like
I have) but never installed.  It is said to have needle bearings for the
torsion arms, bus boys ball joints that bolt up late model disc brakes.  I
don't want to pay for all that shipping just to find out it won't fit my
bus. Any info would help a lot.
