Subject: RE: [VB] My new find

I would agree, it's kind of like Phish being in a Chevy Astro AWD when they
could tour in a custom Greyhound. I was under the impression Jerry signed?
one/both of these, so I thought for that reason they would have some
collectable intrest. The paint might be beautiful, or real nasty stuff that
strong wind would take off, I don't know.
Either way, they are excellent finds, and to get a pre 60 going in nice
shape, regardless of paint is good enough for me, I am glad to see two more
saved, regardless to what Woody does or doesn't do to them. After all there
are his to do with what he likes.
So Woody, are they really signed by Jerry?

It seems unlikely that Jerry ever owned a bus. It just doesnt fit. (In fact
some members of the band were into much faster cars if into vehicles at
all). Photo history does not lead anyone to believe that he personally owned
a bus. There is some mention of a VW BUS being used by the band as a vehicle
to get from one show to home, but not that he or anyone in the band owned
it.

This being late (very late friday, technically Sat but tough, kick me) Ill
tell a story that relates to that vw bus (sort of).

The Grateful Dead were playing a show (circa late 60's).
During the show someone kept yelling from the crowd to play Saint Steven.
After hearing this over and over, Jerry finally stepped up to the mike and
said &quot;Look, we played that last night, and we will probably play it again,
but not tonight. You can buy it on our album if you want to hear it again&quot;.
Someone else took offense to this, thinking Jerry was too hard on this
person.
SO he waited outside the backstage door to tell him what he thought. He
rehearsed what he was going to say over and over in his mind.
Jerry appeared at the end of the show on his way to go home.
This guy started to say, &quot;You were hard on that guy in the crowd. Look Man,
Ive been with the Dead a long time...&quot;

And as Jerry was getting into a VW BUS he interupted the guy and said:
&quot;Yeah? Well Ive been with them longer&quot;!

He got into the BUS and that was that!

&gt;I bet if all the buses &quot;formerly owned by Jerry Garcia&quot; were parked end
&gt;to end, you'd be able to see 'em from space.

&gt; &gt; job.The 65, I was told, was once owned by Jerry Garcia.But I'm unsure of
&gt; &gt; this. Does anyone out there know who owned this bus before Discover card
&gt; &gt; bought it ?? There is a Missouri Vehicle sticker on the Drivers
&gt;windshield.
&gt; &gt; I would appreciate any info. !
