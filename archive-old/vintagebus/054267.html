&lt;&lt; This is the problem. In order to shim this thing to 7.1:1 CR it will need
 .070 shims on both sides. I fear that this will &quot;shim out&quot; the heads so much
 that the stock exhaust and single port manifold will not fit.&gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
We have shimmed out to .060&quot; and had no problems getting the stock intake and 
exhaust on the engine.

&lt;&lt; There is also the question about throwing off the proper rocker geometry 
with this amount of spacing, and quite frankly, that stuff is beyond my 
understanding. &gt;&gt;

Any time one rebuilds or builds an engine one must check valve train 
geometery.  There were many differant lengths of pushrods since VW introduced 
the 40 HP engine in 1961.  Plus to make sure of any changes in the heads, 
cylinders and engine case.  Perfection would be that the rocker arm 
adjustable screw that pushes on the valve stem was always in a straight line 
with the valve stem.  Because it arcs due to the motion of the rocker arm one 
needs to make sure that halfway through this arc the adjusting screws are 
straight with the valve stems.  Otherwise the adjusting screw will push the 
valve stem more one direction slightly sideways and wear the valve bushing in 
that direction.  Making for a burnt valve and possibly a damaged valve seat.  
 
&lt;&lt; With all stock new parts, I can not figure out why I am having so much
 trouble.
  These numbers disturb me:
 Measured deck height:
 #1  .053 inches
 #2  .059
 #3  .047
 #4  .047
 
 Why the variance in 1 and 2 and different from 3 and 4?
 
 These are new VW heads.
 1 48.3cc
 2 48.33cc
 3 48.73cc
 4 48.75cc
  &gt;&gt;

Differant head castings!  Check head part numbers and look for casting 
numbers.  Also check visually the chamber differances between the two heads.  
Best to find a matching pair and even then measure and slightly work them for 
perfect cc match and to rid them of and sharp edges which help cause hot 
points in the head.  We even like to hand/sand paper polish the exhaust ports 
of the heads to reduce the rough surface in these for the heat of the exhaust 
to get into the aluminum head material as the exhaust passes through these 
passages.
