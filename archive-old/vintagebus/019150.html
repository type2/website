In the Local Manufacture Tool book they have this piece listed.Single dolly
wheel that bolts to the horns.If you wanted to beef it you could add a frame
to it that would put some of the load on the frame rails above it.

My thoughts here...

DONT DO THIS.  While I know that a few list members have done this to
dolly a bus, it really made me cringe.

The horns are not built to hold the weight of a bus.  Instead, onlyy to
support the engine and transmission.  The engine/trans load is DOWN on the
horns...the bus would be pressure UP on the horns..


You have a very good possibility of BENDING your horns.

This, IMHO, is a Bad Thing.
