Funny you should ask: Here's a '66 in (I think) DoQuoin (?) Illinois I live
in Dixon and Emailed the guy but I don't know when I could get there to look
at it, his email is: ghiaman_at_hotmail_dot_com, there's also another 66 in Ames
Iowa tel is: 515 771 6725.
Let me know how it goes...

&gt;     I have been on the search for a 65 - 67 Westfalia PopTop camper for
&gt; about 6 months now.  If anyone on the list knows were one is, or has one
&gt; for sale, I would be interested.  I live in Indiana  and would be
&gt; interested within about a 2 state radius.  I am not looking for a show
&gt; winner. A  driver that needs some work is my ideal  find.
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate any leads.
