Hi Renoir,
Where the rear wheels on the ground when he was towing it in first gear?  If 
so, we hope he never towed it up over 15 MPH or else that just did even more 
damage to the tranny and even the engine to boot!  We know of one past 
vintagebus list member who found a bus without a motor.  He towed it at 
highway speeds and had forgotten to put the tranny in nuetral from first 
gear.  Later it was figured the input shaft must have been doing in excess of 
10,000 RPM.  Which turned a nice tight good used tranny into one with an 
input shaft flooping loosely around!    Eric&amp;Barb
