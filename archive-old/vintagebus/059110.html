Subject: bus shirt

Looking at the REI spring cycling mailer and on page 26: &quot;Sugoi Windows Jersey&quot;
a cycling shirt with a picture of a red and white 21 or 23 window rolling
through a psychadelic desert, $70. Very nice but too expensive for my tastes
(kinda like the 21/23 window) but maybe you have the bus and need the shirt to
go with it...
Bus is best.
