Hello, and thanks for making our June pre-Classic event spectacular.
Here are some shots at Anaheim and a few at Charlie's party afterward.
http://www.cyclegarden_dot_com/OCTO2000/
We could not have done it without all the clubs help!!!
We also had some great raffle donations which helped O.C.T.O. out
immensely.
It was hot and beautiful weather, we had over 300 splitty's in
attendance, with 36 barndoor's.
We also had some hard working volunteers helping to keep the entrance
and T-shirt lines down to a minimum.
We are extremely happy the event, and as always we will try our best to
improve on it year after year.
Thanks again for all your support.
