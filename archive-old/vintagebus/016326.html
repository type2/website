Me too. (oops, I should have type that in ALL CAPS)

BTW, bulbs for those are $12 from wolfsburg west.  Lars can get the

There are a *lot* of these NOS lights in circulation.

&gt; I paid $150 for NOS Hella lights (one pair, w/o bulbs) on Ebay, plus $31

&gt; five sets were sold, including at least one other pair to a VB list member.
&gt; Another pair of NOS Hella reached $152.50 w/o reaching reserve on Ebay
