&gt;Good to see you back online, clara,
&gt;
&gt;If you paint the backs of your panels with POR15, they will become
&gt;non-porous and you will not need the plastic sheeting. Paint the side
&gt;edges too and be nit-picky about it! This is one job you can really get
&gt;anal about!  ;-)
&gt;

The plastic is also important as a vapor barrier. It keeps the moisture
generated by all those hot, steamy bodies inside from condensing on the cold
metal, causing many of the rust problems found in areas that aren't all that
wet (like here in central CA). The plastic must be intact and completely
sealed to work properly.
