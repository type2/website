I just purchased the greenbrier single cab, this is the single cab that has
the side ramp on it. At the Classic I talked to Charlie Hamil about it and
he told me they were made in the US and that 50 of these were made and he
knows of one in San Diego area, look for me at the shows and swaps in it, it
is different, gotta go as I have a 1600 mile journey with the original 40 hp
in it, will try to fly out next week and drive it back. Look on Thom's or VW
Planet, I think they have pictures of it there.
