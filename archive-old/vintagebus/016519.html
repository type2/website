hi, i am new to the list and i just got a '65 microbus.  it was in some guys 
barn since 82 and i got it for $150 and its loaded with extra parts.  i dont 
have a use or room for a lot of this stuff and im interested in selling 
these middle and rear seats.  there is also a kick panel for one of them.  
the frames are in good shape and the upholstery is decent, with one 12-18 
inch tear on the middle one.  ive heard that these are kinda valuble, but if 
i can get an idea on an average price, ill let them go close to that.  any 
help would be much appreciated.  thanks in advance!!
josh
