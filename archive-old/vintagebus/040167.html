&gt;anyways:
&gt;when vw specified 185R14s on bay busses, this DID NOT mean radial - it
&gt;meant reinforced. same on the splits.
&gt;so saying that a 185 radial tire is all you need is wrong; if it is a
&gt;passenger-car tire, it at least has to be reinforced. better is a &gt;truck
&gt;tire.

Well, the 'R' in the size designation does stand for radial, but did VW
specify reinforced sidewalls as a minimum on the later (radial equipped) bay
windows and vanagons.  VW never specified 185r14s on splits, they specified
(from 64-67) 7.00 x 14 6PR on the station wagons, and 7.00 x 14 8pr on the
trucks, or so states my Chilton.

&gt;second: the tires your bus came with were european tires (michelin,
&gt;continental, etc). different dimensions, slightly.

True, but the difference is something like 2% of the aspect ratio,
negligible in the real world.

&gt;third:  those tires may have been constructed to slightly different
&gt;specs than american, tho he couldn't say for sure.  but the tires made
&gt;TODAY are not the same as the tires your bus came with - hopefully they
&gt;are better :)

True again, for one thing our busses came with bias ply (cross ply) tires.
With the quality of radial tires today it would be silly to go with bias ply
tires on a bus that is driven regularly.

&gt;he asked what make/model i had, and approx. what weight (i said 5400
&gt;lbs), and what the vw inflation was (30/40 to 30/44 loaded); his opinion
&gt;was that those figures were a bit low for modern tires and that weight -
&gt;he suggested 35/45, and go up if the ride and tread wear allowed it. he
&gt;strongly urged more pressure if the van was fully loaded, or towing. but
&gt;BE SURE to maintain the specified front/rear inflation ratio.
&gt;

I curious as to where you came up with 5400 lbs.  The placard in my 67 shows
a GWVR of something like 2000 kg, or roughly 4400 lbs.  My Chilton (I assume
for the early bay windows, Chilton is horrible at actually matching specs to
model years) lists the unladen weight of a kombi as 2624 lbs, with a 2171 lb
possible payload, adding up to a gross weight of 4795.  If you really have
loaded your bus down to the point that is weights 5400 lbs, 35/45 psi don't
seem at all out of line, though you would have to know where to weight is to
get the front/rear bias correct.  I'll bet you bus doesn't actually weight
that much, and you will wear the center of the tread at that pressure
though.  As an unscientific test: drive briefly and slowly though some dirt
(the should of a highway maybe), then get out and look at your tires.  Are
they dirty all the way to the edge of the tread?  If not, your pressures are
too high, and it will affect tire wear.  (Seeing this on my bus is what
convinced me that 40 psi was to much for the rear of my lightly loaded bus.)

&gt;his postion was (off the record) that tires made in the last 10 years
&gt;might not meet the ride standards that vw was shooting for 'back in the
&gt;day' at those lower pressures.
&gt;for another, he pointed out that most car makers deliberately lower tire
&gt;pressures to improve 'drivability;' what this means is that the ride is
&gt;spongier, more 'car-like' on our busses, because americans like that.
&gt;your ride might be much more 'active' and responsive at the higher
&gt;pressures, but you might not enjoy it :)
&gt;

This is true to an extent, car makers do often reccomend lower pressures
than those that generate best handling.  This is also their defense for
their tires blowing up on certain Ford vehicles, so anything BFS says on the
matter must be taken in that context as well though.

&gt;the last thing he stated was that we should all go buy a GOOD tread
&gt;gauge - 'properly inflated at ANY load will mean that the tread gauge
&gt;shows ALL the channels to be the same depth straight across the top of
&gt;the tire, ie, in a plane. if you are overinflated for your load, you
&gt;will see a bulge with the gauge that is not visible to the eye; too  low
&gt;will result in the side channels getting deeper.'
&gt;

Actually, underinflation will wear the edges of the tire first, meaning less
tread depth on the edge, and more in the center.  But pressures are not the
only thing that affect uneven wear; wheel alignment, driving styles and
placement on the car also have an effect.  Front tires will tend to wear
more on the edges, and rear tires more in the center (on most rear-drive
cars at least).  Camber can make a big difference, so on at stock splitty
with something like +3 degrees of camber in the rear, i would not be
surprised to see the outside edge of the tire wearing faster than the inside
edge.

Also, fwiw, one does not need to buy a 'GOOD tread guage', a ruler and a
good eye work just fine.

&gt;for fun, i'm going to call my uncle in akron (who was on the firestone
&gt;indy team in the 60s) and see if he can get me a load/psi chart from any
&gt;old buddies still in the factory.

Would be interesting to see.  I worked at a tire shop for a while and never
even heard of such a chart.  I can tell you that most people at tire shops
don't know a thing about how much air should go in any given tire on any
given car.  They tend to just put 32 psi in every car and 35 psi in every
truck without ever thinking or caring what the specs are or what is
appropriate.
