Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel shut of valve

&quot;Type 06&quot; - most of the way down the page.
~$US30 + shipping
They do not have a secure site for ordering, but my dealings with them
(via email) were fine. I haven't gotten around to installing it yet,
but it looks straightforward and the instructions are pretty simple.

Love the Alice's Restaurant quote, btw--

&gt; I know someone was talking about this not long ago,
&gt; did someone post a supplier where we can buy an inline

&gt; I am in the process of installing a gas heater in the
&gt; bus, and I would love to put one of these on, so if
&gt; the thing ever did catch fire, I could turn off the
&gt; supply so as not to have a full tank of gas poured on it!
