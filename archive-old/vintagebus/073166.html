It has been a while since I ordered from them, but I
don't recall that the shipping cost was too much, and
they shipped quickly.  They are a good soource of any
kind of industrial supplies or tools, from files,
taps, dies, nuts and bolts, to lathes and tooling, and
everything in between.  I think that their catalog is
online, although I usually use the hard copy that I
have at work.

p.s. thanks to the response from many folks to my
questions about my alternator/generator on the 74 bug
engine in my 65 double cab.  A alternator and fan
showed up on my porch Tuesday morning, just dropped
off by a fellow in the area, and I had already put a
generator in it and had the engine in by then.  But I
will be all set for &quot;next time.&quot;  
The dc is sitting in the yard all clean and waxed and
rarin' to go.  Supposed to nice for a few more days
(no rain that registered in the rain gage since July
15, and none in the forecast--hey, this is
Wisconsin, not Arid-zona).
