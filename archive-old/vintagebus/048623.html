&gt;How about directions from the airport?

Here are the directions coming from Kansas City International Airport
(KCI).  Sorry about leaving these off.

1.   When leaving the airport, get on I29 south.
2.   Drive south on I29 to Berry Road exit (about 3 miles)
3.   Turn right (west) on Berry Road.
4.   On Berry Road, travel 2.7 miles.
5.   The metal building will be on your right (north) #11010.  Look for busses.
6.   If you get to the Grass Pad garden shop, you've gone to far.
