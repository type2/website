Most of the glass (automotive) in this country isn't made in this country.
South Africa is the largest manufacturer of automotive glass in the world.
PPG glass. owned by Pinkelton (spelling) or the other way around, who also
owns Sekurit or was it Sigla (bought out by Pinkelton), who makes all the
Porsche 356 windshields, in South Africa,Volkspares might be able to help on
this, they used to have an office in Westminster on Garden Grove Blvd. might
be able to find the gauge of glass your looking for, Volkspares of Europe is
a company based? out of South Africa, but from what my glass man told me
(only his word) is that most safety glass is all imported to a universal
standard, in what i believe 2 thickness, (does this make any sense). but
said that other thickness may be available. I have a hard enough time just
getting clear sheets of glass to have windshields cut out of, mostly all
tinted!
A company in Costa Mesa, Cal. might be able to come up with the glass
thickness you need, they do a lot of the prototype cars for Chrysler and
have a glass furnace there where they make there own windshields and other
glass for there prototypes. I doubt if they sell to the public, but if snoop
around and kiss a lot of a#s someone there might be able to lead you in the
right direction. I haven't been there in 10 years but still know a couple of
people that work there, 1 of them is my old painter from my Porsche/Costa
Mesa days.
