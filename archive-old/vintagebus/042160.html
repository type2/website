&gt; So how about it, anybody had one open before?  I'm thinking of giving it a

I was going to open mine and fix it, until i realized that there as
nothing wrong with it.  PO was just and idiot and liked cutting holes in
the dash to put junk aftermarket switches in i guess.

&gt; of needles.  The spare I've got I have because Dave Raistrick is about the
&gt; swellest guy on the planet ;-)

wanna nother one?  this one doesnt do me any good since the damn lock
tumbler wont hit start...sigh.

i'd be willing to bed the contact is just worn or carbonated.  a clean or
bend should straighten it out.
