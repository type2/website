Subject: RE: [VB] CE Safaris - Install


The CE seal for the safaris they include are from a Fiat or something along
those lines. When I was at Bad Camberg there were a couple of buses with
these seals and I was told by the owners that they work very well and don't
LEAK or get wind noise through them, only Thom will tell. Good luck and keep
us posted on the good and bad of these, I was offered a deal to import these
along with Alan's sheet metal but have been waiting for somebody on this
continent to install them so we would know the good and bad, Thank-you Thom
for taking the plunge for us.

original message:

The seals are different than what I'd seen before; a crimp-type part for
the frame, and a curved lip toward the frame.  Hmmmm.
