Subject: Do it yourself tire removal?
Date: Sun, 19 Nov 2000 20:11:14 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Anyone ever remove their own tires?  I've got a set of rims that I want 
to get blasted .  They've got bald tires on them I don't care to lose 
but don't feel it necessary to shell out $5 a rim for a shop to just 
dismount.  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut=
the tires off?  Could it be that
simple?  tia
