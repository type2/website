Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

Sean,

Actually, I *do* have the doghouse set up. There is about an inch and a
half of forward clearance between the front of the doghouse tin and the
end of the bolt coming thru the hole. That is enough for me to thread the
nut and place the flat ratcheting wrench onto the nut. I occasionally have
been known to drop a nut into the tin, but I keep spares around, which are
replenished when I remove the engine and recover them.
