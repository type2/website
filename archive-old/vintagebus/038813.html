I know that this is a beetle question, but since the shift bushings on buses
and beetles are the same I hope that you all dont mind this post.

I am changing the shift bushing on my 66 beetle and I noticed that the new
bushing seems way too small and there is 1/2 to 5/8 gap in the bushing after
it is wrapped around the rod.  Since the old bushing was in pieces, I have
nothing to gauge it to.  The parts house says that there is only one bushing
for both bug and bus and they stock no larger (or other) sizes. That big of
a gap seems way to excessive to me.  Perhaps it is defective?  The guy at
the parts house was baffled and said he got the same gap when he tried it
there as well.

There was a recent arcticle about this repair in one of the VW mags and they
mention nothing of this problem.

Thanks.
