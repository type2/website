hey try a key from another splitti!!

In my case, i had a 62 split with keys, now the 62 is gone and i got a 60,
the guy gimme one key, but i tried the 62 one and guess what,... they fit!!!


Another key-case happened when a bunch of baywindow went to camp and one guy
broke his (only) key, well out of about ten westfalia (bay) one guy had a
key fit the door handle and unlock it, and one another had the key fit the
ignition !!

What i mean here is VW keys seems to fit many years/lock !!  try your friens
key

Objet : [VB] engine lid locked!


Is there an easy way to unlock a t-handle without the key? It seems that the

guy I got it from has never had a key for the locks (only ignition) and some

how the handle locked when I closed it last. So now I am unable to get to my

engine compartment and I need to get this thing going, I am sick of looking 
at it (Ok, I'm sick of pretending to drive it) 
Is it possible to unbolt the apron from underneath?
Anybody in Houston know a locksmith?(that wouldn't charge an arm and a leg?)
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Brian
