From my standpoint I would consider it a collectors item, however the
ad is written in such a way that it seems like the current owner just
stumbled across something that the previous owner didn't know about.
Perhaps it would appear different to me if he included things like vin
or some sort of confirmation of it being the real thing. I'm not
saying this isn't the real thing, but other than setting up it's own
email address, the owner hasn't done much leg work. Just seems a bit
oppertunistic. Which he is entitled to be, I just have never gotten
along with that style of person as well as the typical bus owner, so
the poor guy at the other end of that ad doesn't get my vote for
nicest guy around. Then again I wouldn't be in the market for
something like that anyway, so I suspect he could care less what I
though :)

I would love to hear where it has been though. Might make for a neat
story.
