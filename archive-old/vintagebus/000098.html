On post 59 trucks, the bumper itself is the same.
Its just *NOTCHED* out a little bit to make it clear.
They WERE the same bumper, just notched from the factory.

&lt;&lt; My DCab built december '59 has an ordinary bus bumper which needed to have
 the inside corners cut in a bit to accomadate the square profile of the rear 
three quarter panels. This post reminded me of the swearing I did when I 
tried to fit the newly straightened and sprayed bumper the night before 
setting off on an epic journey.&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
A friend with a 1963 SC truck had a simular problem.  He could not believe it 
when we told him that there were not special bumpers for trucks after the 
1958 model year.  Turned out later that his bumper brackets had been 
pushed/bent in the past just enough to make the correct nice straight bumper 
not fit!   Eric&amp;Barb&gt;&gt;
