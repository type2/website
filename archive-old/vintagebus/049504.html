Subject: RE: [VB] dizzy shaft shim in case   :P

&gt; have taken a few engines
&gt;apart that had waded up balls of dizzy drive washer in them and still ran
&gt;fine, till the rod bearings went away, but that's another story.
&gt;
&gt;ronnie.



how much of 'another story?&quot;

the shims are, apparently, gone - what they did was get jammed on the left
front side of the cam, and then they 1)beveled the front (fif) edge of the
cam gear quite nicely... no chunks, splits or unevenness! 2)shaved many
slivers outta the case circumference in the cam area. Then they
disappeared.
I mean, i did everything but take the case apart - all access holes opened,
lights and mirrors and magnets on sticks applied - no pieces. a bunch of
particles on the bottom of the case that stuck to the magnet, but those
washers are vanished.

i KNOW the correct answer is: crack the case, new bearings, begin again.

i really do'nt have time or money to screw with rebuilding what WAS a nice
(if rich)-running motor.
that beveled cam gear makes for the smoothest idling sonofabitch i've ever
seen, btw.


moral: EVEN if the ghost of muir AND porsche are sitting on milk crates
watching you prank with the bus, and bob hoover strolls by too and they all
call ya a sissy and double dogdare ya to do something YOU KNOW doesn't
sound right...

don't do it.
