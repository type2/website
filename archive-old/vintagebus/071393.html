Subject: Re: [VB] more maintenance-heat improvement

----- Original Message -----
&gt; &gt; wrapping insulation on the 3rd section of pipe under the bus (behind the
&gt; &gt; splash pan) that is not insulated from the factory. I also lined the
&gt; &gt; splashpan with insulation.
&gt;
&gt; What sort of insulation did you use?  I have been thinking of doing this
and
&gt; just not sure which stuff to use.....
&gt;

I used the stuff that is basically bubble wrap with aluminum backing on both
sides. Supposed to reflect heat back into an object with an 'air gap' to
help with the heat/cold transfer. Seems to work great, as the heat
difference from the front vent was signifigantly different. I secured it
with 14&quot; zip ties from Home Depot so nothing is permanant. I didn't have my
splash pan installed (I took it off this spring, and never got around to
putting it back on) before yesterday, so i'm sure that helped keep cold wind
from blowing on the bare pipe too.

If it didn't have the original insulation on the pipe, I would probably find
the foam insulation for waterpipes (looks like roll cage padding), then wrap
it in this stuff. I put the seam downward, so if any moisture got in there,
it could drain out.

I'm still going to find a gas heater to install in it though. Going downhill
in a canyon at night when it's 20 degree's is just way too much for the
stock system to handle. Not enough heat generated from downshifting the
whole drive.  :-)
