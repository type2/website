&gt; &gt; Hey
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those are great pics!  So you sold your bus hey - too bad?  So do you
have a
&gt; &gt; new one - or rather another old bus?  There are some great web sites
over
&gt; &gt; here in NA - such as http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/ and
&gt; &gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/also you can access a great early bus mailing
&gt; &gt; lists at http://type2_dot_com/.  If you don't mind I'll forward some of your
&gt; &gt; pics to one of the above lists where the well be very much appreciated.
If
&gt; &gt; you give me your permission I'll also send your name and email address.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, thanks for the great pics.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, my bus is coming along - I've lately been stripping the old
&gt; &gt; undercoating off and re-undercoating with por15 - it's a slow and
tedious
&gt; &gt; process but hopefully worthwhile.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; no problem.
&gt; but put the web adress off my buddy in la with it because he's the one
&gt; that is going to sell it in america
&gt; lenny copp of west coast classic restorations.
