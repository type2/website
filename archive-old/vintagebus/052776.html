Maybe he was one of the passengers...?

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; While cleaning out my wife's Grandfather's house after he passed
&gt; away, we found this article clipped from the local paper for Elgin,
&gt; Texas. After doing a little research with some of the sports info on
&gt; the flipside of the clipping, I aged it at around 1968. Where's that
&gt; double cab now!!!
&gt;
&gt; Here's the link: http://www.type2guy_dot_com/dcelgin.jpg
&gt;
&gt; p.s. We have absolutly no idea why he saved it. He wasn't a VW guy
&gt; and there weren't any other articles or anything of that sort. It was
&gt; under some clothes in one of his drawers. Makes you wonder?!?!?!
