I've looked up and found some info for a friend of mine, but am falling
short of deciphering it in whole.
Anyone care to fill in the blanks?
14  11 2    Nov 14th, '62 is my guess
387  195    No idea
US211   Red      port of entry in the USA   211?  red, cuz it's red huh!
1028858

The wird thing is the bus is registered as a '63 and the serial number
doesn't seem to jive with what my records show.  Any input here?
Thanks for any help.
later
