I KNOW I KNOW!!! (mad frantic hand waving :-)

It is a starter solenoid from an old Ford!

Seriously!

It is a starter assist relay... If it works, fine!  Don't fix what ain't
broke, but if it isn't, go out and get a Bosch WR-1 kit.  Does the same
job, for about the same price and requires no messing with your wiring
(tho since you have the solenoid, your wiring is pre-molested :-(
