I agree with Greg. This was a great weekend. Thanks to everyone involved.
It was fun meeting people from the list too! One of my favorite moments
came at the end of the day on Sunday. First I have to note that VTO was
there in full force (and in full voice during the raffles!). Well...just
after Christine from VTO won the engine, everyone was bailing out. John
Howard said &quot;Let's get all of the list members up here for a photo!&quot; All of
a sudden, there were 40+ people milling around. Christine and Johnny look
up and ask...&quot;What club is this?&quot; Somebody says it's the vintage bus list.
They said ask &quot;Where are you from?&quot; We said...&quot;All over!&quot; It was good to
know that there was one &quot;club&quot; that was bigger than VTO there! :)

Now I'm prepping MY zebra bus for OCTO!

See you there!
