Hi

I just bought today a french magazine and  i posted on my site new picture
from the magazine.

One of them is 2 split found in belgium (1 is a 1950 barndoor rusty in a
field)

Four other picture about an article of a split, i believe from
England..Florida Orange Boy, but i like the way its painted.

Then i posted 5 scan from the classified, but beware almost 1 meg (to be
readable) each picture, but my god its full of stuff (and its in thumbnail
at first so no big deal)!!!

Just post all this as i think lot   of people will find interesting thing.
Do you want to subscribe ??  I scanned the SUBSCRIBE page too with a nice
painted split hippie van... i liked the way it was painted

here is the link:

For translation purpose... Combi  in french is like SPlit or
Baywindows...they dont seems to make any difference...

There is also a nice article about the Type 147, that was only used by
german and swiss post ...

have fun!!
