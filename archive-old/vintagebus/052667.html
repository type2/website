Subject: muir's riser/rod rationale

here tis:

1971 edition, 1st printing, page 240.

he is describing throwing a rod after picking up the first printing of the
manual and selling them to book people; he muses over the recent rebuild
(10k), and found no valid reasons for the rod to go. he realizes that the
heat riser is plugeed and goes hmmmm.

&quot;With the discovery of the plugged heat riser, the whole scene started to
make sense. Burning cold fuel causes carbon to form; excess carbon causes
the engine to run hot; heat causes the oil to stop lubricating and there
you have it. A plugged heat riser will cause a rod to burn.&quot;

not exactly kantian discourse, but it made sense to him.

i think the moral to glean is:

tis better to have a clean heat riser than not. no matter why.
