Subject: Who has a CB?
Date: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 16:25:28 -0400

I am wondering how many people run CBs in their busses to communicate while
caravaning to events?

I have one sitting on the shelf and would like to know if it is worth
putting in the bus....  Also where do you put the antenna?

The CB in my truck has been great, so if you all use them I will install
mine.

Thanks,
