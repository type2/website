Subject:  RE: [VB] Case Bore Size?

I thought John Denver died in an aircraft
accident cos the experimental he was flying 
went with the 70 single relief fitted with incorrect
oil cooler grommets??

And he's been a bit cheesed off about it ever since?

The other thing that downgrades the list is self-
proclaimed experts and bus-snobs that give out 
incorrect information...

&quot;B&quot; cases are 1968-1970.  they also came in both 
single and dual relief, depending on the year.
