Subject: More finds...(tad bit long)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,
After seeing all the posts about finds I guess I'll tell about my past 
weekend.
Well, since me and buddy are looking for new projects, (me-pre-62 bus, 
him-pre-66 bug) , we drove around all day. I live in Central Texas so figured 
we would find some decent bugs and some bays....never guessed I'd see a 
splitty.
Well, we found two splittys in a junkyard in Ft Worth..one 67 Westy 
completely stripped..bone dry and Straight. and another hardtop westy good 
for parts.
Coming back in to Waco we see some more junkyards and decide to take a 
looksy...no vws but as we're driving out my bud says 'stop' so lo and behold 
a 21 window sitting..excellent shape too.._dot_can tell it's been sitting for 
years...then in a field not a half mile is a kombi sitting behind a 
trailer..looked complete but rusty.
Figured that'd be it so we headed home..on the way home we see another run 
down shop with a bunch of VW's fenced in...mostly bugs and bays but i see 2 
splittys in there both of em uncut panels...one looked straight and a tiny 
bit rusty but the other was absolutely straight, complete and no rust at 
all....we decide to drive around to the back and that one straight panel has 
this huge window like you see on modern full size conversion vans...like 2 
foot wide and 3.5 to 4 ft long.....cut in about 5 tenths past the drivers 
door...man what a hack...this bus was perfect besides that..but oh well, I'll 
check on it anyways.
I also got a lead on an early 55 23 window deluxe barndoor that's rusty and 
in east Texas.
So all you guys who say there ain't any buses around like out West....they 
are out there. just gotta hit them backroads and drive slooooow.
I've met a few listees since I moved from Vegas in Jan. and hope to meet  
some more at the Ennis show in May...drop me a line if you're going.

Take it easy,
Beto
Waco, Tx.
