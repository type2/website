&gt; Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter and
&gt; the later '66 and up versions.  Does the earlier version extend further 
&gt; below
&gt; the cab floor?  Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to 
&gt; get
&gt; a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Aaron
&gt; 

The shifter on a 67 uses a different bush support at the front than earlier 
years.
