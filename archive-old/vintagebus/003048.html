Yes it is that time again. I have to update the Oktoberbus page and request
all who still have trip reports and pictures up from previous years to send
me the links. If you supplied me with this information previously, do it
again. :-)

BTW, The dates for this year are October 12, 13, 14, 2001 at the old same
place in Union Grove NC.

Thanks,
