When I bought my 93 eurovan (1 year old), the sales guy gave my wife and I the 
keys and said 'go, take it for a spin... bring it back when you're done'.... 
and then we had to hunt the guy down when we got back to buy the thing.  We 
found out that they didn't really want to sell it since they had just got it as 
a trade in and hadn't even cleaned it up.

...much different than the ch*****r dealer... (what were we thinking when we 
even walked on the lot). 

I'd say it was the best car buying experiance I had ever had!!!
