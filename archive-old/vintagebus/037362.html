Found a splitty hanging out in front of some old railroad cars, among a bunch
a old cast iron stoves here in Mass.  Its up on all four tires, the id plate
has the following #'s  216166294.  Is this a '64?  me thinks it's a westy pkg
-  - -- -
for the later years (65 on) the ist 3 digits of the VIN are

type-2 as in in type 2 (transporter)
model -1 - as in panel van
year -6- as in 196*6*

the last 6 digits being the serial #

doubt it is a westy, though that doesn't meean there isn't westy stuff in
there.

though there was a website with the m-codes.  Thom?  Dave?
