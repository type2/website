That Thom, he's got a line on everything.  Remember that movie with Bert
Reynolds I think it was called The Longest Yard?  Bert's best buddy in the
pic, I think his name was &quot;Caretaker&quot; could get anything you wanted while in
the joint (BTW he was burned to death in his cell).  I think that should be
Thom's new nick name.

Hey Caretaker, I'm looking for some interior parts for my 65 Westy.  Any
leads?? ;-)
