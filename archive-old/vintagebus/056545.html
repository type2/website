Subject: Re: [VB] not a public debate room!!!!!

I think it would be great to show up and see every car entered with a flag
on their antenna that had &quot;VWOA&quot; with a red circle with a line going through
it.  I think that would send a message.  Maybe someone could make some
license plates like this for those of us who live in states where a front
plate isn't required...

&gt; I think that by not going to a show you show that, not
&gt; only you are you die hard, but you have a voice that
&gt; counts and will be heard. If they sell even one car we
&gt; still lose, right? If the show was moved or resheduled
&gt; wouldn't the charities still benefit? The real winners
&gt; should be the people who came to the show to enjoy
&gt; their hobby, especially those who want to keep it
&gt; going.
&gt; I guess we will just have to agree to disagree.

&gt; &gt; See on this show  volkswagen stands to gain very

&gt; &gt; few cars to lookers, but the real winners are the
&gt; &gt; charities and show
&gt; &gt; promoters.  They are just using the companies
&gt; &gt; grounds.  And what better way
&gt; &gt; to start getting the message out but to let them
&gt; &gt; know how die hard we are and
&gt; &gt; that we are here to stay and willing to work with
&gt; &gt; them to make it happen.
&gt; &gt; Crashing a show like this would just unleash another
&gt; &gt; pack of dogs that I
&gt; &gt; don't think many of us want to see..
