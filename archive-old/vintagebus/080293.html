It's been a long time since I did the brakes on my 61 bus.
Did it all new when I got the bus in 95... then it sat for a year &amp;1/2 about 5 years ago, so I went through and cleaned/inspected them then.  now the  brakes have not been as responsive, &amp; the finger test when adjusting indicated that the frotn wheel cylinders were oozing (not dripping, but the brakes were getting a bit gummy) so time again to delve beneath the front drums.

first jacked it up applied jack stands, and greased the suspension.  
grease grease grease.  grease is good.  grease grease grease .  
yummmmmmm
oooommmmmm. 
commune with bus... look at the moving parts in the steering.  yup they're there.  seems to be tight, not sloppy.  I really like this bus.  Good bus.  Pat pat.  have some grease.
 smear grease on the underbelly of bus, prevent rust.  

Pulled the right front (oh... it's got those bay window nuts on there, no silly lock washers.)  yup.. shoes look a little dark.. cylinders oozing.. pull it apart, clean backing plant, apply new Varga cylinders (it has a 1 ton front suspension on it), clean the shoes up and the drum and put it all back together, grease threads to deter rust.

go to left side, take it apart.   funny home made circlip for the speedo cable.   looks about light the right side, dark, a bit gummy, not really bad.  needs new cylinders.  clean it up, install nee cylidners, shoes are fine with some spraykleen and wiping with a clean rag.  so far so good. 

now look at the outer wheel bearing and it has loose bits of metal in it, so it must be replaced.   no problem, I happen to have a new one... yum, right there where i put it.    

But the old outer race doesn't want to come out.   I try a variety of hammers and drift, clean up the drift so it has a nice edge.  bigger hammer etc.  finally go over to my bentley and turn to the wheel bearing page, they have pictures of nice pullers, a thing shaped like a lozenge that slips in from the inside and you use a nut'biolt to squeeze teh race out.  Cool, I'll make one.   

also, the drum is mashed.   looks like someone mashed the side of wher eteh dust cap goes on with something heavy.   I carefully use hammers to mash it out a little.  investigate other drum possibilities, reject them, and work on this one so the mash doesn't impede the removal of the race.

PING!!!!
this bus was hit right there years ago(about 50mph?   maybe more), with the dust cap flying off into the buses.  Damn this is a sturdy beast.  funny echo, cause it';s been years since that accident, and I didn't even know.

take a piece of metal off a speaker magnet, and proceed to grind it to a smaller circle with two flat sides.   oops.   I made it the size of the race, it needs to be a bit smaller.   fix it.  get appropriate washes and bolts and stuff, and it pulls it a millimetter or two, but notice teh thingy is bent (it was a thick piece of metal too) and sliding into the race, like I made it slightly too small.   this is not so good.   a front beam washer is about the right size, cut the outie end down so it is a circle with a flat side, and that works better.  but really hard to turn the nut.   I get out the 3/4 &quot; drive ratchet (longer handle)   turn... turn... turn... finally CRACK!!! 
oh.  
did something break?
nope, the race just let loose.  now it comes out easy.  wiper drum out, apply grease,

new one taps in nice and snug... not too hard, not to easy.   Wipe the braking surface of the drum clean,  put it back on the bus, put new (packed with grease) bearing in place, put axle nit on and adjust it to the appropriate tightness (which always seem like guesswork to me). tighten nut squeeze bolt with allen.   reapply dust cap and homemade circlip

I had looked at the rears in April, and they were fine then, so I didn't get new cylinders for the rear.

Dunno if the brakes work any better.  I still need to bleed them.   so, 9 years for wheel cylinders... sounds good. huh?

 I guess it's probably about time to go through the whole checklist again...
