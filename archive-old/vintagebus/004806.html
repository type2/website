I called up Bergs today and the price of their conversion for the fanshroud
metal that allows you to use a T4 cooler is darn near $85!!!  I asked what
it comes with and Katy said that it comes with 2 pieces of metal to redirect
the flow of air and 2 longer 6mm studs.  I think for $85 I'll do it myself.
The part number is #7300 if anyone is interested.

BTW:  Does anyone know if Bergs know anything I don't?  I mean does that $85
give you something that the VW mags didn't show you when they cut and welded
on their own bigger piece of oil cooler ducting?  If there isn't really
anything special, hell, I'll weld it on myself - didn't by a damn welder so
as to just sit and stare at it.
