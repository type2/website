&gt;i have more or less a stcok 65' bus that has an
&gt;aftermarket &quot;gear shift lock&quot; (one from bob scott _at_
&gt;vintageparts), anyhoo now the question..
&gt;
&gt;recently i have been getting a nice grind if i try and
&gt;shift into reverse (obviously i am stopped when doing
&gt;this).  [...] The problem *appears* to be at the front
&gt;end of the bus as opposed to back in the tranny.

Stock (no shift lock) the plate around the shifter is adjustable.  
On my Dad's '74 Bug, you lift up the rubber boot around the shifter,
and unscrew the two 13mm bolts.  Then you can lift the shifter up and
the plate the bolts were in will come with it.  There is a ball on the
end of the shifter and a socket down under the floor...grease these up
with wheel bearing grease and put the shifter ball back in the socket.
Note that the bolt holes in the plate are slotted for adjustment.  As
a guess, center the bolts in the slots, tighten them up, and head out
on the road with a wrench handy.  Adjust the plate as needed for best
engagement of all gears. 

Hopefully the shift lock is the same idea with longer bolts.  There
should be *some* way to adjust it.  Another possibility is a bad
shift rod bushing under the Bus - pretty easy to see if you take
down that pan between the front wheels.

Good luck!
