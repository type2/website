My 67 DC still has the original headliner and trim strips.  There is one
on each side of the fresh air box.  In the center of the roof, there is
one on each side of the center dome light.  There is no trim strip at
the rear (that is, over the back window), nor any sign to indicate that
there ever was.

&gt; That's what I don't know.  I would bet there were the
&gt; two on either side of the fresh air box, and I'm
&gt; guessing there is one about over where the divider is,
&gt; but I can't seem to figure out if there was one at the
&gt; back over the back window.

&gt; &gt; Hmmmm.... my 59 only had the two strips on the sides

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Were there others????  The parts book seems to lack
&gt; &gt; detail in this area.
