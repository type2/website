Subject: Temp substitute head nut

I know this isn't as exciting as the parts supplier thread.....but anyway,

I lost a one of the nuts and washers that hold the head to the 
cylinder/engine. I've got one some that'll fit, but they obviously 
aren't the big daddy ones that are supposed to be there.

Question: Can I assemble the engine with these as a substitute and 
then replace them when I can find/get some correct replacements? 
(Other than the &quot;you'll forget it or blow it off&quot; reason)

It kinda sucks living in the middle of nowhere. When stuff like this 
happens your stuck. No REAL parts places around. No foreign/metric 
anything anywhere for miles. It's all Ch*vy and F*rd around here. 
Anything I want i have to mail order. That always means another week 
until I can continue, and then realize I need something else, 
'causing another week of waiting, ect.
