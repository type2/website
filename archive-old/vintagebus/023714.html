Subject: Identification of part

Ok,
I know that there are folks out there with more knowlege in their heads
about these busses than most manuals contain. :) I am trying to figure
out what a ceartin replacement piece of the body is called. I have put a
picture of the actual part in question at
http://www.fament_dot_com/chip/inside.gif  . It is the part of the floor
that the lower latches for the doors go into. If you have time, please
take a look and tell me what it is called. Thanks
