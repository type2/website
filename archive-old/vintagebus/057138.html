Subject: RE: [VB] Re VB Any Kelley park updates 

What we need are more shows in Norcal that have bigger
venues! I wish the Bug Bashes were still around (under
a different promoter of course).

&gt;   Ya the line at KP usually involves 2 pots of
&gt; coffee, unless I'm sharing.
&gt; Last year I brewed 3 pots waiting in line. Not much
&gt; fun, show up at 5;30
&gt; don't even get close till 8;30, waiting in line
&gt; sucks, thay really need the
&gt; OCTO boys to run the parking, never had to wait at
&gt; an OCTO event

&gt; &gt; Hear that sound  Thats the KP death knell...
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, it will be an interesting year at KP. 
&gt; Honestly, after putting on
&gt; BYOB the day before (yall keep coming to BYOB if you
&gt; dont want to do
&gt; KP), my fiancee and I will get up and out by 6am and
&gt; if we make it into
&gt; the park, great.  If not, well park down below and
&gt; wander in for a few
&gt; hours and then go spend the rest of the day on our
&gt; own.  Thats just what
&gt; Ive opted to do...I will NOT get up at 3am to go sit
&gt; in line for five
&gt; hours or more!
