Subject: 4th Annual VW Buses event in Ohio details

Hey Y'all,
I have finally gotten all the details finalized for
the Fourth Annual VW Buses, Bands, 'n Brews Event
(formerly called &quot;Buses 'n Boats&quot;) on May 21-23 in
Oregonia, Ohio which is 36 miles north of Cincinnati.
The event is sponsored by the Ohio Valley Tribe of the
Full Moon Bus Club.
This years event will NOT have canoeing (long story)
but we will be having a Homebrew Beer &amp; Wine tasting
on Saturday afternoon. Brew up a batch of your best
brew! If you don't homebrew, that's OK, Just bring a
few microbrews that are brewed locally in your home
area for the tasting.  There will also be LIVE MUSIC
beginning at 4:00 pm and running until 11:00 pm on
Saturday.  Of course we will be having the World
famous Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast burritos on
Saturday morning.  This event has steadily grown over
the past 3 years and we expect to have at least 50
buses and well over 100 people this year! Don't miss
out!
Here's the link to the web page:

It's sure to be a blast!!!

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
