Hey,

Its been some time since I've perused the CD.  Is all this stuff on it???

&gt; Dear Ken,
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; Someone wrote, enclosing the below,
&gt; apparently from the Vintage Bus mailing list, asking if I'd written a
&gt; procedure for this.  Could you please post it for me?
&gt;
&gt; &lt;
&gt; Dear Someone,
&gt;
&gt; I don't think I did; not for buses anyway.  The procedure is the same but the
&gt; specs are slightly different.
&gt;
&gt; Are all of your parts new?  (Hahahahha... sorry :-)  Okay, are all of your
&gt; parts within spec?  Is there any wear on the ends of the trailing arms (ie,
&gt; around the hole where the link-pin goes), on the oil seal covers or on the
&gt; shims themselves?
&gt;
&gt; Of course there is.  After all, the thing is old enough to vote.  (Indeed,
&gt; old enough to qualify for the Office of the President.)
&gt;
&gt; The reason I mention this is because that seemingly minor accumulation of
&gt; wear -- even on the shims themselves -- makes the instructions in the manual
&gt; little more than a guess.  The manual assumes all of the components are
&gt; within spec.  In real terms, that usually means going over to the parts-guy
&gt; and hitting him up for a new stack of shims and four new oil seal covers.
&gt; Now the stack-up of shims spec'd in the manual will work.
&gt;
&gt; I ran into this same problem when rebuilding Grendel's front axle.  I
&gt; salvaged shims and parts from three other axles to get enough parts to
&gt; rebuild one.  But I couldn't get any new shims or oil seal covers (ie, those
&gt; dished steel washers with the notch on one edge).
&gt;
&gt; So I let the bus tell me how to do it.
&gt;
&gt; With the axle horizontal and the trailing arms trammeled &amp; checked (ie, both
&gt; sides were equal), the camber is supposed to be about half a degree.  (You'd
&gt; better check me on all of this.  My bus manual wandered away years ago and I
&gt; rebuilt Grendel's front axle about four years ago; I'm whipping most of this
&gt; out of my ass. :-)
&gt;
&gt; The trailing arms are slightly offset.  The spindle is supported by two link
&gt; pins.  Each link pin is provided with eight shims ( ... I think.  Early buses
&gt; had more than later buses.  My '57 had 10 (?), Grendel had eight .. or I'm
&gt; thinking of a bug ... Check it.  I don't have a manaul and don't want to take
&gt; the thing apart just to count the shims.)
&gt;
&gt; The object is to achieve a camber angle of half a degree by putting more or
&gt; fewer shims between the inner face of the spindle and the bore in the
&gt; trailing arm.  The extra shims are put on the outer face, under the head of
&gt; the link pin where they have no effect on the dimension because the link
&gt; pin's length is variable.  (That's the adjustment you make ever other oil
&gt; change, taking the slack out of the link pins as the shims wear.)
&gt;
&gt; The rule is to never use less than two shims.  The idea here is to distribute
&gt; the wear in the stack-up of shims.  If you used just one, it will lock to one
&gt; face or the other and a groove would quickly develop in the opposite face.
&gt;
&gt; Even if the parts are worn, the table of offsets &amp; shims shown in the manual
&gt; should be your starting point.  Then put the drum onto the axle and check the
&gt; actual camber angle using the plywood protractor I described in an article
&gt; here some months ago.
&gt;
&gt; Once you understand the geometry involved in setting the camber angle, all
&gt; you have to do is go through the process two or three times until the
&gt; protractor sez you are within spec.  On Grendel, I needed three tries to get
&gt; the passenger-side correct but hit the proper angle on the second try on the
&gt; driver's side.
&gt;
&gt; When it comes to wheel and suspension alignment on antique Volkswagens I
&gt; really think you should do the work yourself.  Five or six times a year
&gt; someone with a king-pin front suspension asks me to look at their vehicle
&gt; AFTER they've paid some shop an enormous amount to screw it up.  And I mean
&gt; some serious problems, such as more than an inch of toe-out and nearly 10
&gt; degrees of positive camber.
&gt;
&gt; Fortunately, all you need to keep your bus in spec is a couple of sticks to
&gt; measure the toe angle and a protractor &amp; a plumb-bob to check the camber.
&gt; You can buy this stuff but as I explained in an earlier article, it is easy
&gt; to make a camber protractor that is ten times more accurate than you need.
&gt; I've already described the procedure for aligning the rear wheels (see the
&gt; articles about the IRS conversion).
