--- Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt; mused:
&gt; Another option if you want a locking engine lid on a
&gt; church-key equipped bus
&gt; is to do the patented VintageBus_dot_com trick of
&gt; installing an upper hatch T-handle.

Or you could do what I did - talk to Gabriel
(gabvwkey_at_cs_dot_com) and he can make you up a engine
hatch lock from stcok VW parts and - voila! - you have
a locking engine lid.  If you're good enough, you can
probably re-key the cylinder to match all your other
locks as well!  I just purchased a whole set
(ignition, 2 front doors, cargo door, engine hatch) of
locks for the doublecab.

I am not affiliated with Gabriel, just a satisfied
customer.

Paul
66 Doublecab - now I have a bus that locks, but I have
no windows in it!
