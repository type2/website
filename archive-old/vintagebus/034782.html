&lt;&lt; Does anyone know the part # for a 25hp manifold?  Or, how to tell the
 difference between a 36hp manifold?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Well the problem with pre-1954 parts is that they are likely to have the old L
### part number instead of the 111, 113, or 211 parts numbers.  The best way
to check both the intake manifold and heads of supposed 25 HP engine parts is
to measure the bottom of the intake legs that should fit the 30mm bore in the
top of the heads.  When VW went to the 36 HP this measurement increased to
31mm.  Eric &amp; Barb
