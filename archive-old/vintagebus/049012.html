I'm bored today at work, so I'd like to chime in on this one.  Plus since I've personally repopped 5 canopies, I have a small amount of first hand experience.

We all know that the bed length increased on both Single and Double Cabs in 1968 by approx. 4&quot;.  As for cab height, I don't believe it really matters as a stock canopy (or tilt) is taller than the cab roof by close to a foot.  The width of the bed (and thus hoops/bows) never changed so that's why Eric&amp;Barbs' parts book shows the same part number for the hoops.

With regard to value, throw that one to the wind.  Anything is worth whatever if a certain person in the world wants it.  Personally, I think $750 starting price is high.  If it ends at $750 then I'd consider it, but only after checking out the entire canvas very closely.  Things to look for other than the obvious, i.e. holes, tears, staining, mildew are looking at all of the stitching, the grommets, the footman loops, the webbing, etc.  These can all be replaced or fixed, but access to the OEM hardware is limited (PLF) and any stitching that needs to be done really cannot be done by hand or even with the average sewing machine.

I paid $700 less than 2 years ago for an original SC tilt, original hoops, center strap and wood slats.  And this was from one of the most expensive guys in the VW hobby (or should I say business).  The canvas was in pretty good shape, a few small dime size patches on the very top but still presentable.  I mainly bought it at the time so I could make a pattern to repop them.  Now I don't think I'd sell it for anything.

I told Greg (aka frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com) I thought he paid a bit much but then again I haven't seen his canvas.  I definitely don't think he got ripped off.  I've paid too much for numerous items that I &quot;had to have&quot;, but then again I now have them and I think I'm happier because I do have them.  ????  You can search forever to find something for $50 less, but why drive yourself crazy.  You blow that on a nice dinner and flush it down the toilet the next morning with nothing to ever show for it.

I would think an nice original canvas would be in the $600 to $800 range, so if you could score the one on eBay for $750 and it's in the shape the seller claims it to be, it's probably a smart buy.  Next year I'd bet dollars to donuts that same canvas will be worth more.
