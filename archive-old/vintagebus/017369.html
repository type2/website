You bring up an interesting point, Clara (can I call you Clara?)

I bought a whole bunch of bulbs for the panel, as I have 6 dome lights
in it total.  All of the new 12v ones are longer than the originals,
and I think they're 12w.  They are *very* bright, and get *very* hot -
do I have the wrong bulbs?

&gt; same from mid 55 (somewhat post barndoor) through 67- the aluminium bulb 
&gt; holder - and takes the same plastic cover with which you must use 5W bulb of 
&gt; the same voltage as your system because other wise the covers get melted.
