Subject: RE: [VB] pre-67 westy hammocks

Should be a dark army green canvas material from what ive seen before,
anybody else? not sure on the length of the poles. I have seen nice ones
before only because they werent used and left on top of the inside cabinet.

Hi everyone,
Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.
What is the length of the rails also?

I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's in
near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But just want
some list clarification.
The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this
shape before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.
