As long as we're not talking about oil, I thought I'd throw my two cents
in.

I read that article and thought it was really good. I was especially
pleased to see that the author (who's a Mechanical Engineer) mentioned
the *superior* heat dissipating characteristic of synthetic oil as
compared to dino oil. The idea that synthetics don't dissipate heat as
well as dino oil just doesn't seem reasonable. If that were true, the
oil would never get hot. The synthetic oil in my engine gets plenty hot.
Gene Berg got a lot of stuff right, but that wasn't one of them.

If we had archives, I would tell you to go read my engine autopsy posts
from last summer, but we don't, so here's the short version. I use
Castrol Syntec 5W-50 and a Purolater filter and change both at 10,000
miles. When my engine dropped a valve (my fault) and I had to rebuild
it, I found so little wear on the parts in the bottom end it was
amazing. I checked my bearing clearances with plastigage. I didn't find
a single bearing worn out of the new engine specs. I could have reused
my old rod bearings. The cam and lifters looked like new.

I'm using synthetics from now on.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From this article the author recommends the synthetic for longer oil change
&gt; intervals, but for 3000 miles the effects are not worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I was on the geneberg_dot_com site and he recommends to use dino juice
&gt; because he believes that the synthetic does not attract and dissipate heat
&gt; well enough.  Granted this may be very old information as synthetics have
&gt; evolved over time.
&gt; 
&gt; I like to run 20W-50 usually Pennzoil, but am going to switch to Wal-Mart
&gt; brand for the price.  At 3000 mile change intervals, an adequate API rating
&gt; and SAE starburst symbol there is no benefit to the expensive stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; If I ran a type 4 engine I think I would splurge for the hydraulic valves
&gt; and synthetic oil(Mobil 15W-50), and change it every 10,000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Who said this would not be an oil thread?  ;)
