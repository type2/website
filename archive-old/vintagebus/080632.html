Subject: Re: [VB] Tacoma powder coating and seat reassembly

..... I then did the lower half of the short middle seat
&gt; but in working on the top I am struggling with the fit. seems I can not
&gt; figure out how I pull the ends in and finish it off. does anyone have
&gt; experience with this? The seat covers are Wolfsburg West if that
&gt; matters.

I've had the same problem w/ the WW front seat covers.  It doesn't seem like
the bottom side edges close off nicely like og seat upholstery. But then
again I'm not an upholsterer.  I would also like to hear if they can be done
to look og.

Tom Buese-nice seats are well worth the $$
