&gt; Is there a practical limit to what size stock SP engine you can
&gt; use a 28 PICT before you ought to move up to a 30 PICT-X?

Hi Alex,
1500cc is as big as you can go and have it work properly.

 Also, &gt; is there anyone that I can send a carb to to get the throttle
&gt; plate bushings replaced?

We have heard Rimco can do it.

 Oh, and one more thing, does anyone know &gt; off-hand where to find the 
&gt; distributor list that tells you which distributor was originally used in 
&gt; which application by part
&gt; number? I think I remember seeing it somewhere online, but I had
&gt; about 50 Bus web pages bookmarked and can't remember for the life
&gt; of me where to look again!  Thanks!
