Subject: Re: [VB] Polishing Aluminum

You can get all alumunum rivets that will not rust,
just drill out the old ones.

&gt; &lt;&lt;I am restoring a 66 Deluxe and all the aluminum
&gt; beltline trim looks all dull and crappy.  I was
&gt; thinking that I would try to polish this myself but
&gt; I
&gt; have no experience in this&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Don,t know if this is the correct way to go about
&gt; it, but I am using the
&gt; following method with Wsety Jalousie windws with
&gt; very good results. I am
&gt; using steel wool. I reorted to it because the finish
&gt; was soooooo bad.
&gt; They are coming out real nice. When I paint the bus,
&gt; I will pull them
&gt; again and polish em up probably with semichrome
&gt; polish (in all good
&gt; motorcycle shops) and spray them with a coat of
&gt; clear from a spray bomb
&gt; to prevent them from tarnishing.
&gt; 
&gt; The screws holding in the windows had rusted and
&gt; were staining the
&gt; window. Went to the hardware staor and got a box of
&gt; stainless for $3.43
&gt; that is enough to do all the windows. I was
&gt; wondering if the original
&gt; screws were stainless and just rusted after fourty
&gt; years of exposure. Or
&gt; was westfalia just too cheap to spend a couple bucks
&gt; more per vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing I noticed was the Pop rivets are
&gt; rusting too. Are
&gt; stainless pop rivets available?
