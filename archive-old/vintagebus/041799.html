&gt; &lt;&lt; Oh please. I have been known to hop in the limo at 1 in the afternoon in
&gt;  August when it is 110 in Phoenix and drive 2 hours to Havasu where it is 120
&gt;  just to drink cheap beer at John Howards and buy parts from Ronnie. It's
&gt;  only hot if you think it is.

&gt; I agree,  Everyday I have to jump in my 67 kombi and drive to east gilbert 
&gt; from west phoenix in the aftenoon.  It gets so hot that I cant open my 
&gt; safaris because i end up looking like a roasted chicken.  But just to make it 
&gt; easier I found tha having a clean bus (at least inside) will do wonders.  
&gt; Probably lowers the temperature mentally about 20 degrees.  haha!  Also i 
&gt; noticed that unlike a NEW car, i dont have to hide plastic thingies under the 
&gt; seat.  Just doesnt get as hot.
&gt; 
&gt; I love driving my bus and the heat will NEVER keep me from that!

To further this lovefest, I'll add that the VW, unlike &quot;modern&quot; cars, was
designed without air conditioning in mind.  The fresh air vents are
generous and the side windows allow good airflow.  The hot bits are in the
back, so you don't get hot air from the engine heating the floor.

My '71 even has side wing windows that can be left open without allowing
access to the inside door locks.  My bus is always much cooler than
&quot;modern&quot; cars after sitting in the sun for a while.

Also, VW didn't paint the top white for style!  If you want to be even
cooler, a roof rack with a deck of plywood will lower interior temps by a
few more degrees.

The engine?  No worries as long as the cooling system is up to snuff.
Unfortunately, most of the buses I see in distress suffer from bad seals
and missing hoses/tin, etc.
