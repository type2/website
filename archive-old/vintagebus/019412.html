The advantage of FI is more carefully metered dispensation of fuel, with 
means to automatically compensate for varying conditions.  Any carb is going
to be a compromise of low-end vs high-end, and will require perdiodic changes
due to fuel quality, temperatue, altitude, etc.

Modern fuel injection and engine management systems do just about everything
except change the oil for you.  Oxygen sensors send feeback on your mixture;
knock sensors give feedback on timing and gas quality.

And yes, FI replaces the carb.
