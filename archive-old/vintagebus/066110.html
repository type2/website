Subject: RE: anyone have a scan of mr.bubblehead?

it was a nice clean jpg. i already turned it into an editable eps for use in 
Freehand or Illustrator. scalable to any size. i changed the graphic and put 
the hat on his head. let me know and ill send you the logo. the vinyl shop 
would prefer the editable eps.

peace,
