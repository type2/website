Subject:  Re: Front Seat Covers Needed and oil pumps
Message-ID: &lt;7md4p9$k8tf_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

 i have used sold and installed TMI covers and foam without a hitch
  the piping on the front of the seat is supposed to be off the front
   so you don't ripe the piping out.

have done at least 20 plus buses with there covers

wolfsburg horsehair is ok if you want originality
but sucks for comfort, way to hard 

i never reuse the original, as it sheds and continues to disinagrate
as you use your bus, ie: my 62 panel with the hump in the backrest
used the original horsehair, did all the precautions, but after 2 years
and over 20,000 plus miles (the famous swap bus) the padding is totally
shot
now i need to redo the seats again, s_at_#t!!!!!!!!

WCM will have their full line of bus seat covers, carpet, panels
and prefit foam by september, haven't used their product yet, but
they do own and use buses so we'll see

another note: TMI is in the process of duplicating the delux door
panels and seat covers in salt and pepper etc, watch out doug 
their stuff is a perfect copy, gary at lavere's was involved
in supplying nos parts to copy (this is what TMI told me)

another note on oil pump filters: the ones avaiable now are imports
the ones from mexico aren't available in this country yet do to nafta
trade agreements, there is a start up company out of barbados who is
starting to import all VW de MEXICO factory parts, complete engines
all the odd parts, trannys etc; but no bus stuff yet, am still working
on getting factory bus parts ex: bus disc brake front ends and new
r/d box trannys complete, also corner window sheet metel and glass
plus a few more surprizes (jail bars) but the side parts angle down!!!

will be posting updates on my web site on all mentioned items as they
become
available or i get more info.

ps. just bought the last of the filter pumps from my supplier, they
have 300
more in transit, which should be here in a week or 2, price to list
members
50.00 including filter (mann) flat cam type, 

pss; they do not fit bay buses with mounting bracket

jist something to do

 

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; Here's what I need your help with: In your opinions, who really
does
&gt;  make the best quality seat covers for everyday use and how is their
&gt;  customer service??  Is it worth the money to buy the &quot;pre-formed&quot;
&gt;  cushions or are they just pre-cut flat foam that is easily made at
&gt;  home??  Thanks again the advice.

&gt; 
&gt;  The TMI seat covers I got from the Bus Depot seem to be good
quality.The 
&gt; only complaint I had with installing those was they didn't have the
wire sewn 
&gt; into the bottom.The TMI covers use a draw sting.Otherwise I installed
them 
&gt; exactly as the originals,using the existing &quot;meat hook prongs&quot; and
new 
&gt; bailing wire.
&gt;  My main complaint was with the so called preformed pads.After
getting the 
&gt; covers on the piping didn't match up with the edges of the foam.I
probably 
&gt; could have played with them a while to get a better fit, but hell
seats are 
&gt; for sittin... not for lookin.
&gt;  If your hog hair cushions are in good shape you may just want to add
a thin 
&gt; layer of foam and reuse them for a better fit. I saved mine for
future use.
