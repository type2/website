&gt; Commercial - 1963 23 window deluxe, totaly restored,
&gt;traded in for New Beetle
&gt;&gt;&lt;big snipola&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, I wonder what the trade-in value was?

A better question would be: what will the trade in value of the waterbug be
in 37 years?  :)&gt;

- - --  -
hm that's  better name for it- waterbug,  but why not take the old barndoor
down to the dealer and see what kind of trade in you'ld get.

I have an advert I tore out of a National Geographic with a new 81 vanagon
and a 61 deluxe, caption says
 &quot;After 20 years we finally got it right&quot;    :)
Now which would you rather have-  the  SWR/BG 23 window, or an orange Vanagon?

Okay more bus content:

getting set for deconstruction.  My aim is to take the finished jigsaw puzzle
and mash it up into little pieces until the bus is in little bits all over my
garage   3 at a time.  No longer will I expect to find concrete floor to step
on.  okay in plain wods it's pulling the trans out and apart from the 61.
Any bets on time?   till the trans is on the floor with the axles off?   The
motor is already out.  This trans was installed about 5 years ago.   Because
I love pulling trannys.

bad hippy!!! No bong hit!!!
