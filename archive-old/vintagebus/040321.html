Subject:  NOS Belly Pan question

Thought the NOS bit would grab your attention 8-)

Anyway,  I have a friend who picked uo a set of
what are clearly NOS belly pans (still working on
him to find out where he actually got the things...
his connections are obviously 'heavier' than mine).

Note these are the underfloor pans for DD and
sunroof models we are talking about here.  

However, rather than the 'crossed' pressing
They only have the one long diagonal pressing....

(to see the 'crossed pressing go to www.splitbusaustralia_dot_com
select the 'Our US 23 window link' and then the
'Fabricating Belly Pans' link)

Has anyone ever seen belly pans like this?  And, more
interestingly, if so, on what?
