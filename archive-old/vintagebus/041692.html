&gt; But it certainly wasnt the worse car buying experience. When years later
&gt; I was looking for a small pickup, I wandered in a Dodge dealership where
&gt; they were asking for a $50 deposit for a test drive!!! I couldnt believe
&gt; it when they asked the dooood in front of me for it. When he walked, I
&gt; stood there open mouthed while he explained to the young trainee that
&gt; &quot;if they dont wanna leave the deposit, they arent serious&quot;. Here I was
&gt; standing there, so serious that I intended on leaving there that night
&gt; with a truck. I went down the street to the Nissan dealership and drove
&gt; home a new truck home that night.

Too bad you didn't take your new Nissan by the Dodge dealer to show them
how serious you weren't!

&gt; But even worse was when I accompanied a female friend of mine to a Mazda
&gt; dealership when she wanted to buy a small pickup and the salesman said,
&gt; and I am not kidding. . .&quot;if you wanna buy a truck, come back with your
&gt; husband&quot;!!! Now I know that was grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like the dealerships like to hire idiots.

I have firsthand knowledge of that.  My idiot neighbor of the last two
years has had jobs selling Dodge, Jeep, Toyota, moble homes, and
Cadillacs, all at different dealers. He drives
home the demo cars of whichever tin he is pushing at the time, with the
exception of the mobile homes, of course!  :)

This neighbor isn't so fond
of me because I don't buy new cars and I help my neighbors keep their
oldies running.  He figures I'm taking bread out of his mouth.

Good.
