Try some white lithium grease and let the rubber sit in some hot water
before trying to install it. The grease comes in a spray can, and has worked
well over the years for me. spray liberally and use something to push the
edges in that will not cut the rubber ( you know what you have laying around
your garage).Good luck.

&gt;
&gt; I have not had any luck yet.  &gt; Are there any tip's out there for
installing the
&gt; rubber trim in the aluminum on the bumpers.  I have
&gt; tried prying it and using WD-40 to lub it.  any
&gt; methods to this that anyone can share?
