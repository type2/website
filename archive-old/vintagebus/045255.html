I need the same.  Doesn't anyone out there have the mixing code for this?  It 
sounds like a bunch of us need it.  Please help!  Our wheels all look ugly.

I cheated and rattled canned the wheels and bumpers on my 65.    No one has 
pointed and laughed yet.  I just did the front bumper last week, did the rest 
a year ago (?)  Same colour of white.  Was tired of people asking when I was 
going to paint it.  now they'll make some other comment.      Looks real nice 
&gt;from across the street.
