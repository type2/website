Subject: Re: [VB] VDO Clock repair

  In a 67 deluxe I have they were most inventive on repairing the clock. They took a new VDO clock and adapted it to 
the back of the original, from the front you can't tell. I will take pics and post in THESAMBA gallery tomorrow

&gt;Hey all, I have a 67 kenzile clock that I am servicing before installing
&gt;it. After going through the back end and cleaning the points so it will
&gt;run, I am now going to clean it up cosmetically. So far I have taken the
&gt;bezel off, the lens and the inner collar from the front side of the
&gt;unit. I figured the minute hand and the hour hand would just easily pull
&gt;off but they don't seem to. I am afraid of pulling to hard on it and
&gt;breaking it. What I am wanting to know is this the way you take them
&gt;off? If anyone could shed some light on this I would greatly appreciate
&gt;it. 
&gt;Thanks Shawn
