Subject: re: crankout windows
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am still pursuing the crank out window seals, windows by 
Hehr: L-2186.

Moving Slowly but surely(I am currently an overworked student). 
Latest info: Hehr wnats me to buy from their reseller, All-Rite. All Rite wants a 13-15 digit part number, which is buried inside the door, so they say. I have taken part fo the window apart with no luck.

Anyway I tried calling Hehr back, and they said I should be able to just send a drawing of the window, and All-rite should be able to locate the seals. I am going to try to send a photo, as I have been wanting to a bit of documenting of the bus anyway.
