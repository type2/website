&gt;&gt;PATRICK BEDARD: Synthetic motor oil gets all new semantics.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Thank You. its what i have been trying to get accross for a long time.
&gt;I have never liked castrol.
&gt;
&gt;On another thought: Gene Berg and others have been saying the platinum spark
&gt;plugs are really crap. I say platinum plugs with a pertronix or other semi
&gt;electronic ignition system really work well. What do you folks think?


I always buy Bosch platinum plugs, the 4-tip when I can.  I have the single
tip ones in my Toyota truck w/ about 80,000 miles on them.  The truck runs
smoothly, and started every time this past winter in Minnesota.  I don't
know how long they will really last.

Bosch says the 4-tips are not available for the air cooled VW engine.
WRONG.  They just don't include the listing in their U.S. catalog.  I
bought a set for my 1200 Beetle at my local VW parts store in the
Philippines.  I offered to purchase sets of them for anyone who was
interested when I went there last year, but no one responded, so I didn't
offer this year (just got back March 2).

Oh yeah, the Beetle runs fine with those plugs.

When I used to be a gas station mechanic in my youth, I noticed that the
old-timers, the so-called 'experts', were the last ones to adopt new
innovations.  They were the ones running non-detergent oil after everyone
else had switched to detergent.  Then they were still running 30 weight
when everyone else was running multi-vis.  Now the old guard are claiming
that 89 cent Wal*Mart oil is as good as Mobil 1, since both meet the same
minimum performance standards.  And they are warning us against those
new-fangled platinum-tipped spark plugs.

When I bought a new Porsche 944 in 1983, the dealer warned me against using
synthetic oil, even if it met the API standards, or they would refuse to
honor the warranty.  Now Mobil 1 is Porsche's factory fill.  Dealership
pinheads are found at all economic strata.

Do the 'experts' also believe the earth is flat, and that the moon missions
were a hoax?

********

On the other subject:  I got burned with a worthless electronic ignition
kit for a vw, which I bought from JC Whitney (yeah, I know) years ago.
I've been shy about spending my money on this type of thing ever since.  Is
there a real *quality* (as in today's OEM quality) electronic ignition for
VWs out there, which doesn't cost an arm and a leg?  And is there any
noticable benefit, aside from the elimination of points and condensor?
