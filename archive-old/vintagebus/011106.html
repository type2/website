Hi Volks,

sorry for bandwidth to US listees, but here goes:

September 4-6, the Community of Interest T2 will hold its annual Bus 
meeting.  This time it's on the camping site &quot;Kreuzeck&quot; near 
Hahnenklee, not far from Goslar, in the scenic Harz mountains.  
Saturday will see a convoi drive to the official opening of the T2 
museum in Salzgitter-Gebhardshagen, and a rally back to the camping 
site.  Admission is DM 45 prepaid, or DM 55 paid there.  Additional 
nights on the camping site are DM 20 each.  These prices are for one 
bus, regardless of trailer, tent, or number of people, and are up to 
50% off normal price for the site.

The focus will be on Bay/Loaf buses as is our club's and the 
museum's, but Splits and Vanagons will be admitted as well.

Those interested e-mail me for details please.  Again sorry for the 
bandwidth, but there *are* some European people on here...

Thanks, and have a nice weekend...

Yours,
    Erik.
