Magoo and i loaded our 63- 23 window Sam, that has a mystery motor--Ergo i know nothing
about it-it just came with the bus---and Bessie the 67 --that i found out from a  friend
of Bessie at BBB V that she was a Sundial at one time--with over 1800 LBs of assorted VW
stuff that most times goes via Che*y As*ro--Both performed quite well thank you, and never
burned a drop of oil.  As TWWM,  i can
very proud that our total of some 70+ years of VW Buses made the trek from Phoenix to BBB
V and back--
As &quot;Arnold&quot; said in the movie--&quot;I'll be back&quot;! ,uj
