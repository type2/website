Its already friday here so I get to be first to post a friday thread
   My sister (school teacher) and my brother-in-law (engineer for major
car company) took possession of the VW thing that belonged to my late
father. They had it shipped to their home. (600 miles) They had known
that the car had not been driven for at least three years. When they
received the car they called me for pointers on driving a standard,
maintenance tips, and restoration information. Well neither of them are
exactly mechanicaly inclined, but they insisted they wanted to do all
the work themselves. When they called me to tell me that the brakes
weren't working very good, and you had to push in on the brake pedal a
little to shift gears, I assumed that the brakes needed bled and I knew
the pedal assembly was very sticky from sitting.                    So
over the phone I explained how to bleed the brakes, and suggested they
try some wd40 on the pedal assembly. They called me back the next day to
tell me that they could not get any fluid out of the bleeders. I went
through the procedure again to find out they were not holding the pedal
down when they opened the bleeder. They tried it again. The next day
again they call me to say they could get no fluid out. They explaine to
me exactly what they are doing and it is the correct procedure. I wonder
to myself if all four brake lines could be plugged, the thing stopped
when I loaded it on to the transporter.      The third day I have a
message on my awnsering machine saying &quot;hi John we got the brakes to
bleed out they work great now, thanks for the help.&quot; but no explanation.
I called my mom (also a vw nut) to tell her they got their brakes
working,but I still don't know what was wrong. Mom tells me &quot; I'm not
supposed to tell you this, but I know what the problem was.&quot; I had to
pry it out of her but she told me. &quot;While you were at work today your
sister called to ask which pedal was the brake and which was the
clutch.Then she explained how they were trying to bleed the brakes using
the clutch pedal.&quot; I had to laugh the next time I talked to my sister
then she knew that I knew what happened. she will kill me if she ever
sees this post....lol
