It's a 1956 Westy (Kombi - model 231) with small flip-top and camping 
box interior. Chassis no. 175 639, body no. 168 289. Engine is not 
original, but I think it is the right year (engine no. 1 759 962 - 
original engine no. 376 783(?) ) It's a US export model (originally 
shipped to Portland) - it's strange for us here in the UK to see bullet 
indicators on such an early bus, and it has the two round reflectors 
below the rear lights. I seem to remember that the rear lights are the 
domed barndoor type (they look almost black), rather than the flat '55 
style ones, but I'd have to check these again to be sure.

this is interesting to hear about the lights.   Here in the U.S. people are
confused about the flat glass taillights used on euro buses 3/55- mid 57, and
early semaphore buses are rare indeed.   The taillight should be very similar
to barndoor, but have 2 wires attached (taillight and turn signal) rather than
just the one (for tail light), and the lens is slghtly bulbier.  The
reflectors are correct, and amazing that they are still there.   Sounds like a
realy neat bus, early westy, congrats.

the u shaped piece under the tranny should be a round cross section, not a U
shaped cross section, is this so?   Do you have the 3 piece doglegs (2 seams
visable from the top).   I am trying to figure out and confirm some changes in
the buses, and yours is close to the change date.

TIA,

Clara
