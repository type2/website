Saw this in the local paper, stopped by to take a look, but didn't get
inside, owner wasn't around. He's Russ at (559)224-7611. Listed at $2,500. I
don't think he has e-mail, will find out tonight. I took a couple digi-pics
and can p-mail on request.

Rust! Popouts have spots showing on outside, 1-2&quot; holes above rockers on
rear driver's side, rusting through bottoms of cargo doors. Missing trim on
nose only. Driver's side bulkhead cut away, but has enough flange to
repair/refab, can't see passenger side. White over red. Apron gone, rear tin
gone, hatch on 2&quot; standoff hinges, flapping in the breeze. Nose has 1&quot;
mounting holes for tire or ?. Sunroof looks solid from outside. Cut &amp;
drilled dash. Looks like he has extra parts inside the van. No middle seat,
rear is there, jailbars, high-back front seats of some kind. Interior panels
exist, tattered.

p.s. Ronnie, how're the Kingsburg Two?
