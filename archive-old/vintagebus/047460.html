Hi Volks,
As promised we found the spare accelerator cable sheeth we recently bought 
from Bow Wow up here and installed in our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Part 
number is 131 721 551.  It is interesting that we had to shorten this about 
7mm from it's 603mm length to fit properly in our 60 panel and the original 
part 111 721 551 is listed as &quot;Protective tube - Accelerator cable (shorten 
to 670 mm)&quot;.
