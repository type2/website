Subject: Jerry Jess Update&gt; not good

Today will be a very good day to say a prayer for Jerry Jess.
He will be undergoing a second operation within a week. Things are not good.
Mrs. Jess sent an email to a very large distribution list on 01/10/2004
indicating the above. I do not have details beyond what is stated in this post.
Your thoughts/prayers for a big friend of the VW community are appreciated.
Thanks,
Jim Ellis
