&gt;&gt;Thanks for all the tips about my bus not wanting to stop...the general
&gt;&gt;consensus was that it is either on of two problems:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Shut off solenoid broken
&gt;&gt;

hmmm,

I don't believe  a failed solenoid will reult in dieseling. If it fails it
will not fail open, but closed ... far from dieseling, your bus simply
won't idle.

In my experience, dieseling follows when the solenoid has been disabled and
the idle mixture is a tad rich. It usually shows up in hot weather.
