Subject: Re: [VB] VIN number help

&gt;685157 if that is the chassis number means that it is a means that it was
made between 11/18/1960 and 12/06/1960 meaning that it would be a 1960!
The year changed with the 1963 model in August but till than it was with
the new year!   &gt;
The change occured in 1955, not 1963.

The model years are a bit random, they even differ between the Export and
German markets, but August is a good all-around month to use.
