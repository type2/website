Hi  again,

   Thanks a lot for all of your comments, unfortunently  I have not had a 
chance to fill the tranny yet. But i am sure that that is why i was having 
that little bit of play.
  I am in the middle of rewiring it also, and I have to go to college and 
work to.  I can barely wait for spring which is late march around here so 
that i can start driving the kombi again.

   Well thanks again, hopefully i will be able to thank some of you in 
person on my trip to the Classic.

&gt; &gt; I have noticed, however, that some brand new RGBox bearings have more
&gt;wiggle
&gt; &gt; in the bearings new out of the package that the old ones I have taken 
&gt;off
&gt;a
&gt; &gt; car.
&gt;
&gt;Doesn't that make sense? Your old grungy RGBox bearings are full of 90
&gt;weight oil and new ones are just lightly sprayed with machine oil.
