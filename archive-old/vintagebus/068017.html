Subject: Re: [VB] Record Player? (fwd)

My CD player is just sitting in my parcel tray, but there's so much crap
around it that it doesn't move.

&gt; I mounted my CD player on an aluminum plate covered w/ the same carpet as
the floor (top part of plate and around the front to the
&gt; CD player to save the paint under the dash tray), then the plate slips
into the rolled bull nose of the underdash tray and goes back
&gt; to the bulkhead that the under dash tray attaches to. There is a hole
(well 2 holes) back there and I used a fender washer w/ 1/4&quot;
&gt; bolt and a wing nut to secure it at the rear. solid as a rock and very
quickly removeable......2 plugs and 1 wingnut _at_ about 15
&gt; seconds. No holes had to be cut. Just used existing ones.
