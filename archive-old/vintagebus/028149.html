Subject: LEAF Festival in Black Mountain, NC...

No, not named for *that* leaf... ;)
It's the Lake Eden Arts Festival at Camp Rockmont in Black Mountain,
NC....
directions, etcetera, can be had at http://www.theleaf_dot_com/
It's the 26th/27th/28th... this weekend.
There is a *big* bus following that always goes there...
arts, crafts, wares, stuff for the kids, folk music, bluegrass, contra
dancing... you name it.
there is also a *major* drum circle in the evenings up to the wee hours
in a hollow near the upper camping areas... a bonfire encircled by
scores of drummers and dancers.. :)
the lower camping areas are more sedate, family-oriented quieter
areas... ;)
so everyone can be happy!
i wish i could take my westy, but the motor is not finished... barely a
longblock on the engine stand... 1600cc, DP, 6.6:1 CR, balanced, etc...
I have been laboring over this engine in my spare time, which has now
run out....
I will be traveling/sleeping in a dark green 'yota pickup with white
camper shell... and i'll likely be in the upper camping area or down at
the drum circle or wandering about, should anyone decide to attend....

see ya there... :)
