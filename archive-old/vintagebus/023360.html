In a message dated 98-07-16 22:16:10 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I was looking at a british website when I found a picture of a mass of
buses
 on the factory parking lot. None of the buses has overriders on the front
 bumpers. Is the overrider a US safety option or what? Some of the buses in
the
 picture were deluxes so it was not a factory deluxe option. &gt;&gt;

The overriders were standard for US bound models.
