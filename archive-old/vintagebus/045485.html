On the other Hand.....
If you get used to doing it without taking the engine out it really isnt 
that bad. Generator replacement is of course easier with the engine out 
but can be done with it in. After you get the learning curve out of the 
way, it is much easier to do then pull the engine on a road trip. The 
trick is to hold up the fan shroud with something while you yank the gen 
out. I have done this many times and find it alot easier. Remove 
fanbelt, loosen fan shroud, remove four bolts, and  its out.

I have to second this .     The first time I replaced a generator I did it
this way- it worked fine.   a few years later I  had to replace a generator
on another bus, and was repeatedly told it couldn't be done with motor in
situ, and to pull the motor- took me longer to get him to stopping telling me
how to do it than it did to actually do it.  &lt;grr&gt;

but...  there may be more than one answer.  There may  well be more than one
way to do things.  Do it the way that is best for you, and keep your mind
open.    There is so much to learn from people that I seem to learn the
wierdest stuff in unexpected places.
