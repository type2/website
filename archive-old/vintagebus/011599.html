&lt;I think you guys miss the point.

Imagine someone gives you a 13mm wrench.  You're working happily on
your VW, wrenching away, until you need to do a repair that you need
a pair of pliers.  Do you instantly post to the list that 13mm
wrenches are evil and are no good?  No!  You go find a pair of pliers!&gt;

13mm wrenches aren't opinionated and overbearing.  Hoover is.  That's the
point. Taking it with a grain of salt only works for so long before the
real flavor begins to creep back in....
