Subject: Speaker location

Hi,

Back on the list for a short while. Where do you folks put your stereo
speakers? I am soon to install a CD stereo in my bus and I am not sure where
to put the noise makers. In the kick panels under the dash? Maybe in the
door panels? If so, how to get the wires across the hinge point. Maybe in
the roof panels ( I have a DD delivery camper so it has the hard board
panels up there)?

Love to hear from you all!!

Thanks,
Chris
