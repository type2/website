 I also looked at my Drag link to see if it was bent, and yes it's bent
 but it looks as if it should have a curve, however mine has been rubbing
 underneath enough to scrape away some paint. I could not tell by the bbb
 how mine was suppose to look, I might have missed that page.
 
 So with these new findings can someone shed new light on it for me? Any
 one know of a good photo of a Drag link so I can compare mine?
  &gt;&gt;
yes it does come with a bend, but these were the same symtoms I had with a 
extra bent drag link.   the scratching paint thing is definately not kosher.  
 Go get you a nice drag link, perhaps drive to a shop, and compare a good one 
to yours.    all will come clear.  then have fun changing it, or prudent pay 
someone to.  watch out- perhaps the pitman arm is damaged as well.    does 
you bus look like it was hit near a cab door?
