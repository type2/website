That was a very nice rear bumper, the guy selling it was behind me in his
pick-up? He also had a set of complete deluxe trim which I think sold before
he finished unloading! The same guy is always at Pomona and always has good
deals! Sell it fair and get rid of it, I've bought a lot of things from
himin the past, but passed on the bumper to let someone who really needed it
get it, a good deal for a C note, that's what he told me.

Yes...$40 was what I wanted to pay, but...

The bumper I got is indeed complete with overriders, mounts, and splashpans.
I was informed by Greg of Vintage Warehouse that it is also the proper
pointed blade for my '67, so that tipped the scales on my decision a
bit..... The guy who I  bought it from wanted $150...wouldn't take $100 or
$120, so...

I did see the really nice painted bumper for $150!!  I was standing over it,
trying to make up my mind when some guy up and bought it!  That sorta
sucked, cuz I was almost there!  It was perfectly straight!
