When I drove the Kombi to Cleveland over the summer, I had the same
oil-on-the-back problem.  I had no oil leaks except for around the sump
plate.  I think what happens is the oil drops off and gets caught in the
backdraft when the bus is moving at speed, so splat it goes on the back.
This is the reason why you shouldn't use a bug muffler on a bus -- with any
leaks at all in your seals, you're sucking exhaust gasses back into the
interior.

Channel your oil leaks out to the rear corners and you should be ok ;-)

&gt; During all this driving, I've gotten lots of oil drops on the back of
&gt; the bus. I've had this before, when an oil cooler broke. The oil cooler
