No.  You have a HUGE short or draw somewhere in the electrical system

&gt;I went to hook up jumper cables on my newly acquired 67 westy (just towed it
&gt;home today).  I hooked the positive cable to the terminal that goes to the
&gt;starter and the negative cable to body.  The source vehicle had the positive
&gt;cable on the positive terminal and the negative cable on the negative
&gt;terminal.  When I did, it produced a HUGE spark.  We opted to push it into
&gt;the garage rather than continue.  My helper suggested it could be positive
&gt;ground.  Is this right?
