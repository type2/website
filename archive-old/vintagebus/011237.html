&lt;&lt; Here's what happens when I get into something:  I was just going to get it
 &quot;decent&quot; but now I can't stop.  I must be sick. I do still have plans for a
 trip in this bus in the latter part of September!
 ---------------------

ya- I meant to do a quickie paint job on my 65 westy- it tool probably 2 
months, but I am very happy for having a shiny bus to drive, and really liked 
learning the paint prep body stuff I did.

 It wasn't me that cut the spare tire well.....I have plans, though, to turn
 the remnants of that and the gas heater slot into spare parts holders...
-----------
that bus used to have a american brand  (south wind?)gas heater in it-  think 
I had put pop cans or something to block off the engine to inside gap  (?)   
is the extra knob still on the bulkhead under the drivers seat?   see the 
mounting and exhaust holes in the left side of engine compartment.  had 
another 66 westy that had the exact same deal.  seems they cut the spare 
wheel well to fit the heater.
........................
 
 I have to thank the person what welded in the replacement battery pan!  Good
 job!
 ------------------

was that in the little log book?  I seem to think it might be mike, who also 
replaced the wheel wells and some rocker rot.

 A piece of info:  The only substance that I have scraped off of this bus
 anywhere that has NOT had rust under it is roofing tar!  The metal
 underneath was still shiny!  Almost all of the paint and definitely all of
 the VW seam sealant has had rust to some degree. Let's hear it for roofing
 tar!  (Although it is a real bear to remove!)
