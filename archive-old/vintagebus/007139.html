Subject: NQ's T4 on a budget - New engine

Well it seems that one can get a new T4 for $1145 from the bus depot.  It
appears that I shouldn't have to spend any more than this on my own rebuild
since I wanna do it on a budget.  But man, the price of cams borders on the
cost of a T1 crank. WOW!  Just thought I'd pass this on.
