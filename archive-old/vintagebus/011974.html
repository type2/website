&gt; Well, or divide the price by the life of the battery and compare it
to the
&gt; above. Seems like you guys are overspending. Up to your neighborhood
Auto
&gt; Zone and they have a big wire rack of &quot;rebuilt&quot; batteries that run
around
&gt; $17 last I checked. Some of them are jumbo-sized but they're all one
price.
&gt; I normally get 3-5 years out of one of these and I've bought a good
few
&gt; over the cars and years. Looks like around 50c per month, worst case.

Our AutoZones here in SoCal don't seem to carry used batteries, at
least the couple I've been in (they're relatively new hereabouts).

Cost per month seems to be the key thing.  I usually buy 60 month
batteries from Manny, Moe, and Jack for a bit under $40.  That comes
out to $0.67 per month, and that is the guaranteed maximum cost (if
the battery dies early, it is pro-rated).  In our warm climate,
batteries usually go their full rated life if they aren't abused by
deep discharge service or letting the water get too low.
