Subject: Re: [Re: 67 westy tent trivia]

&gt;Hi Rick-
&gt;
&gt;I shold add that I already have a westy tent from about a 74' westy so I
&gt;am pretty familiar with what they look like and how they set up.
&gt;
&gt;More specifically I was trying to figure out what was &quot;unique&quot; to these
&gt;tents that were suposedly made for splitty's..
&gt;
&gt;My guess would be the distinguishing factor would be that the zip up flap
&gt;on the back was designed to specifically accomodate the fold out cargo
&gt;doors as opposed to the slider


The back of the tent has a rubber molding that slides into the channel on
the drip rail.  I know the earlier tents would unsnap the molding from the
tent which would make putting the molding onto the bus much easier.  It
would seem a lot of work to slide the tent on the channel before you set it
up, but I guess that is what has to be done on this style of tent.  Sewn
around the back of the tent are flaps that will fit around the cargo doors
when they are opened in order to form a seal between the bus and the tent.
The back flap is zippered on 3 sides and rolls up when you are ready to
pass between the bus and the tent.

&gt;Do you have any pics of the tent set up?

I have had it set up only once, and failed to get any pictures, sorry.  The
tent has had some use and I noticed most of the zippers and window netting
needs to be repalced.  The canvas is pretty good shape, but does have a
couple of small holes in it.  The tent does have the multi-colored front
awning roof.
