That's why they are usually in such bad shape.  They are a PITA to

&gt; I was under my bus a littel while ago, and I notcied that the rubber grommets around the brake lines were pretty much disintegrated. I ordered some new ones(pretty cheap parts). Putting them on seems like a real pain in the a**. Any suggestions on putting these on?
