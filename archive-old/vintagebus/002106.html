&gt; Check some local welding shops to get the welding done, they will be
&gt; cheaper
&gt; than letting a body shop do the metal work. After the new parts are welded
&gt; on, apply a good 2 component primer to protect the work.

&gt;
&gt; Also Make sure they can do sheetmetal work, rember this is not like
welding
&gt; a trailer or structural steel, and that they understand fitting panels,
not
&gt; beating in the side of the bus the capping the panel over it and welding
one
&gt; solid bead from one side to the other.

Good point Kelly. Not every shop that does metal work is as good as you are.

But, body shops can also do shoddy work. My point was that a &quot;good&quot; welding
shop would accomplish what he was wanting just as well as a body shop.
