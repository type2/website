Volks,

I spent the Labour (heh,heh,heh) Day weekend stripping my rims.  When I =
finished I re-weighed them and they were a hundred pounds lighter! =20

I naively thought that a couple of rattle cans of Aircraft stripper would =
do the job. The instructions said plan on a 10 minute soak and then use a =
plastic scraper, and for thick stuff, use a 20 to 30 minute wait.  I gave =
up after three coats.  I think by the time I got all the coats of paint =
off I had gone through the Pleistocene, Precambrian, Cambrian and =
Jurrassic ages. =20

Not only that,  . . . while cleaning and stripping the INSIDE of the 5 =
rims I discovered a couple Tyranosaurus Rex foot prints in amongst the mud =
and grease, and I think I have a small chip of a petrified sagosaurus egg. =
 . . . I sent the speciman up to the state dino lab up at the Ewe of Ewe =
in SLC for testing, and will get the results back next week.

Hellish job.  I quickly gave up on the stripper and went to one of those =
abrasive wheels and my compressor.  My son bought a cheapie wheel from =
Harbor Frieght and it lasted through 3 rims.  They were closedLlabor Day =
so I went to Sears and bought quality.  First time I didn't get what I =
paid for.  The Craftsman wheel flew apart 5 minutes into the 4th rim.  I =
used a wire wheel on the last two.=20

I bought some black POR15 to base coat them and of course I know I have to =
finish them with a top coat while the POR15 is still &quot;tacky.&quot;  My question =
is this:  can I just use a rattle can of paint for the finish coat, or do =
I have to spend the 42 bucks and get POR15's finish paint?  Hey Volks, I =
am an Angeleno from the '60s.  No chrome for me.  We used to paint our =
rims BLACK.  Cool.

Before anyone remindes me, I did wash them down after stripping, using =
Gimple Sreen.  I still need to &quot;tooth brush&quot; around the inner rim and lug =
holes, with Aircraft stripper, but the job is basically done.  Now I need =
to vacuum all the paint chips and dust outta my garage.  What a mess.

Won't be long now and My Sweet Bus will be hitting the road legally.  =
Can't wait to cruise up I-15 to see my buddies in SLC!

Best,

Curt
