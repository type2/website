Subject: [VB] Inspecting a tranny in the dirt
Date: Thu, 6 Jul 2000 21:06:29 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Misato's tranny is howling like a bane of the north, so I'm starting to
think about my options when it goes...well, south.  It also pops out of
second and has a ridiculous (in excess of 1mm) amount of axial play in the
pass. side RGB.  I have a few options that I can think of to ward off
failure of the unit, or be prepared when the axe falls.  The first uses the
old center unit:

1. Do the bearings in the pass. side RGB, or maybe both.  The tranny howls
in fourth but shifts smoothly and surely, and she only pops out of second
when downshifting.  The howl has gotten quite louder recently despite fresh
oil, thus my worry, but I have no shifting problems or popping out of
fourth.

Or 2. I can drive on it as-is until it fails.  This was the course of action
I have been suggested to take, but truth be told I can't afford a rebuilt
unit right now.  So here's the rub: I have this tranny 'neath the porch.  I
do not know its condition; it is complete from drum to drum, and it's a
big-nut tranny.  It was given to me.  The drums do not turn but as the
brakes are still intact I'm guessing the shoes are just rusted to the drums.
To test it I'll free the drums up.  I'd like to figure out as well as I can
whether or not this tranny is any good without installing it, as it's darned
heavy and I would be upset if it didn't work when I was all done :-)  So any
advice on checking this tranny out on the ground, at the most moving it
around a bit but not installing it?  I realize installing it will be the
only sure test.  If I find it to be bad, I think I'll try doing the bearings
in one or both the RGBs even though the driver's seems ok.  If nothing else
I can use them on an eventual rebuilt center unit.  Pointers to specific
messages in the archives would also be welcomed, I turned up a lot of stuff
but nothing specific to my cause in the first thirty or so.

Any more ideas to drag out the life of my Kombi's trans would be appreciated
too :-)  I've replaced the oil in it already.  Incantations?  Defending the
world from evil in exchange for good bus karma?
