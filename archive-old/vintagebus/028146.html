Subject: speed?

Howdy y'all!
Stella made it to MI without hitch this past weekend....over 1K miles in
a week...I couldn't believe it.  My idle cutoff solenoid jarred loose
and I had a leaky valve cover gasket...but those were quick fixes :)

Anyways....I'm purchasing a nice 62 bus soon here....and I wonder what
speeds i should be driving in it.  It has the original small nut trans
but it does have a nice 1600 motor in it.  What kind of speeds will make
what rpms?
All i need for this bus is a *nice* turquoise middle seat....but that
will take a while to find ;-)  At least i have the kick panel and the
brackets for the seat...thats a start!  I can't wait...this bus is all
original.  Original turqouse paint with white on top that is just
beautiful.  All of the interior is turquoise...the seats have the
original material with no separation or rips or staining....all of the
panels are there and still have the chrome trim...even the headliner is
still there!  The headliner is separating around the edges though :(  No
rust on this beauty except for 1 quarter sized hole in each rocker.
Those can be patched....will be done by a pro too.  anyways...I'm
stoked!  no pics yet...but I'll have some when its in my driveway :)

thanks all,
Isaiah
