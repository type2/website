&gt;  &gt; and how fast were you driving? (I understand the typo- 3300-3400 rpm at 
60)
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;   I have found the best cooling rpm is 2600-2800
&gt;  well, i was trying to go 60, (actually i double checked tonight 60 is
&gt;  3100-3200 55 is about 28-2900)
&gt;  
&gt;  But... going 55 _at_ 2900 in the 98 degree desert heat on the flat road got
&gt;  me up to 260 degrees right quick... had to back down to 50 MPH at probably
&gt;  25-2600 or so.

right- you need to drop BELOW 2900rpms to get to that optimal cooling temp, 
so for your gearing 50 is more like it , though you could use a tach and the 
temp guage to find the optimal cooling rpm/ speed precisely.  it is funny- 
that couple hundred rpms can make a big difference,  still, your bus seems to 
rum pretty hot.  I wonder what the compression ratio is.   do you have a 
doghouse fan?   I found the type IV doghouse cooler  (typIVDHC?) dropped my 
temp for freeway driving by 5 to 10 degrees C over the regular doghous cooler 
(RDHC?).
&gt;  
&gt;  &gt; hm, wonder why  DPs always crapped out on me?
&gt;  maybe SP is the answer, but my dual port in my 71 works fine, the dual
&gt;  port in my 61 splitty (the engine in question) overheats like a crazy
&gt;  person. i dont get it, the main differences are the 71 is .20 over and the
&gt;  61 is .60 over on the line bore, the 61 has a non stock oil pressure
&gt;  relief spring and of course the 1641 p&amp;c.
&gt;  

ya, each engine is unique.  any idea of the reletive CRs?  that can make a 
huge difference, assuming everything else is grand.    My experiment with the 
fatter oil pressure relief spring is that the fat one makes it take longer 
for the oil pressure to reach the bigger part of the circuit, which actually 
includes the oil cooler.....hm, look at the pic in your bentley and/or 
muir............hm, maybe there is a connection between this and your cooling 
issues, might as well put a stock spring back in.
