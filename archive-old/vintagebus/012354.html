Subject: lake havasu airport, BBB III update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the airport moved off the island a few years back
but we still have one, there's a new airline that flys from vegas to havasu for 49.00 each way, also
there is the havasu shuttle that drives around trip for around 85.00, havasu is about a 3 hr drive from vegas also about 3 hours from phoenix
it might be wiser to fly into phoenix and try to hook up with some of the abc club guys and ride up and back with them, there should be 20-40
or more buses coming up from the phoenix area
if anybody needs help in making arrangements for BBB III contact vwhoward_at_ctaz_dot_com or ronnie_at_ctaz_dot_com  the LONDON BRIDGE BULLIS will help in any way to help you make your trip.
ps, you can probaly rent an econo box from some local vegas or major car rental joint for around 24.95 a day that could work out cheaper, lots of car rental places in las vegas.

BUSES by the BRIDGE III   !UPDATE!
McKenzies performance has donated a sway bay set
for pre 67 buses
WOLFSBURG WEST
