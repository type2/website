Great to hear the you guys are still around ;-) Uh...not that you're old or

Uh, yeah not old or ANYTHING like that. =) I was just looking at the photos of
the 2005 Shasta Trip and everyone's beloved projects and &quot;lucky finds&quot; on the
Samba. Frankly, I don't have that kind of energy any longer. How people can
find and afford the parts at this point is way beyond me. Even the run of the
mill parts, from my perspective, seem to becoming unobtainium and/or spendy.
The days of buying/selling $500. buses to get the parts you need are over (I'm
guessing).
It was members on this list who helped me find the most difficult to located
bits for that PITA Westy &quot;resto&quot;. Thanks to Clara W and Michael in Toronto for
the help. =)
Oh man, I think that I need to go apply for my AARP card and take a nap...
