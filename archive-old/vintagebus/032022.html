Woke up early to the sound of raindrops,   picked my friend Roan up, and
hauled 3/4 hour up to the Fairgrounds.  Puyallap was mad.   as usual.   lotsa
stuff everywhere.   heard there were some nice buses out in the parking lot.
  Saw a rolled mushed blue and white deluxe FS,   maybe the one someone
posted about to the list.  Found some neat bits and talked with groovy VW
people.  The PLF velvet green panel with logos is pretty durn cool.     The
sun came out and warmed and dried it all up.    I'm beat.   My bus needs it's
brakes bled.  Squishy.  Stopped at Taco Bell on the way home and the girl at
the window said &quot;does that thing have heat?&quot;  &quot;Yup&quot; I said, wondering why she
asked that when it's 70 degrees outside.
