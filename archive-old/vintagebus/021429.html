Subject: Looking for source of Pins for Sliding Sunroof.
Date: Sun, 9 Aug 1998 21:01:46 -0700 

Hey out there,

	Does anyone know of a source for the pins that attach the header
bow to the sliding sunroof?

	The pins look like a cylinder that has on end radius-ed down and
threaded and the other end has a slot cut in for a screwdriver.

	These are the same as found in a bug.

	The usual suspects have turned up dry ...Wolfsburg West, Vintage
Parts, BFY....

	Who knows the number for Charlie Hamil and the Bus Stop?

	Any leads would be appreciated.

	FYI: Part number is 115 875 565

THANKS a BUNCH
