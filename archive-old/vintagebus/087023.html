Subject: AridZona VW Original Bus Roof Rack

Just got in a 4 Foot Original Bus Roof Rack with all 4 clamps.   still has
the VW sticker,  part # ZVW153201

I think this will fit a DC as well.    Price is $200.00 FIRM.  This is a
deal to ABC club members who need a rack for their bus.  I would Not be
happy if the buyer flips this rack to make money. Took me a while to get it
at this price. Will fit later models as well. Pick up in Phoenix only.  Just
in time for Jerome, uj
