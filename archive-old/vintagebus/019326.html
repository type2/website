I think ebay's almost played out as far as trying to get super-top dollar for
stuff.  There are still some suckers being whelped on a daily basis, but most
of the people have figured out the game.  This isn't just for VW stuff; I
saw an article on MotleyFool_dot_com that showed how the average auction value
has been steadily declining, while the number of auctions has been steadily
increasing.  The success rate has been falling as well.

That's the reason VintageBus Auction is a better choice; since
there isn't a &quot;game&quot; to be played, people will put in *real* bids, and not
micro-incremental bids.  The other cool thing about VintageBus Auction is
that you can bid on the same stuff your friends are bidding on without
pissing them off, since you're not driving up their bid price and bidding
against them.

If I can just figure out a good way to *market* the site without offending
everyone on the planet spam-wise, we're there!  OTOH, I spend way too much
time working on the barndoor (and now the '55) that could be spent working on
the auction site and promotion.
