&gt; The rain gutters are usually undamaged and unmodified, so they are flat,
&gt; and may be properly used as reference plane. I always compare the gutter
&gt; and the bottom of the rocker panel for agreement.
&gt;

The gutters are good on my bus - however my rockers are definately the
second set if not 3rd or 4th- mine is a UK RHD bus - to find one that hasn't
had the bottom 6&quot; all the way round replaced is very rare over here!
Using the gutter I have found that front to back on each side is pretty much
spot on the same, and from side to side it is less than 0.25deg difference.
Obviously the underseal had more of an effect than I thought....

&gt; &gt; Will definately use the anti sieze on both ends - the fact that they
were
&gt; &gt; seized caused most of my problems
&gt;
&gt; Yes, that has always been the main problem here too. Both sides are now
&gt; easily removable for service, as are my rear brake drums, etc. They all
&gt; come off by hand, no tools needed.
&gt;

I am chasing every thread to before replacing them.  I have been quite lucky
with some of my bolts compared to friends buses - though I think by having
good quality tools it helps.


&gt; Hehe! Sounds like my first time ;-)  Don't panic - you can reinsert them
&gt; quickly and adjust them easily, once you've thought out the process. You
&gt; become a pro after one time doing this adjustment/repair. The nice part is
&gt; setting the bus down, rolling it out to get it level again, and beaming at
&gt; your work.
&gt;

Can't wait to get it rolling again - I took it off the road at the end of
October to do a mechanical refresh - and still haven't finished - getting
there though - got all my parts back and ready to bolt on now!

Thanks a lot
Paul
