Thank you to all that replied! I used a Sawzall , man that cut easy!So far I
cut the front( in front of the seats) off took me all day to start ( that
first cut), but the VW parts will live on in other Vans..... To all that
asked for stuff, I'll keep your E mails and see what I cut off with out
mangling too bad. I guess  cutting in smaller parts is better that big
one's.   Lloyd in Eureka , Calif.
