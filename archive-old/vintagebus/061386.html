&gt; I might be wrong George, but we looked for that and there didnt seem to  be
&gt; enough metal there- had even brought taps just in case.

Look at the underside.  the metal into which you thread is &quot;buried&quot; in the
bottom of the oil sump, but you can see part of the metal from the
underside as a slight bulge between the fins.  There was never a produding
boss at this location.
