&lt;&lt; Another local guy has a roofrack on his bug, and on that one he slid 
little short pieces of vacuum tubing over the rack feet, the cloth covered 
kind.  That seems like a good plan except im unsure if that tubing is too 
thick... you could also try that thinner walled clear pvc hose from the 
hardware store.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Using cloth braided German fuel or vaccume line is not a good idea as it 
seems to tend to imprint into the paint over time!  Using either US style 
fuel line or clear flexable tubing from you local hardware store will not do 
this.  Originally it seems most if not all of the German manufactures used 
for each foot of the roof racks clear tubing cut to fit over the entire 
length of each foot.  You can redo this by cutting the new tubing the same 
length as the foot of the roof rack and cut a &quot;U&quot; shaped cut into the middle 
side of the tube then slide one side into the &quot;U&quot; shaped cut and then stretch 
the tubing till it fits over the other end of the foot.  If you can not get 
it to stretch enough then cut the &quot;U&quot; shaped cut wider allowing you to 
install it without so much stretching.  This type of installation locks the 
tubing on the feet of roof racks and does not slide off like the two piece 
per foot style does.   Eric&amp;Barb
