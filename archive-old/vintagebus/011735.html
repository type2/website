Subject: Request for advice on attending Jerome meet if you can't drive there

Recently there's been a lot of talk about the upcoming meet in Jerome, Arizona.
Much of the focus has been on driving your bus or other VW there, rather than 
towing it on a trailer, and on camping out during the weekend.

I don't have time to attend at all this year, but I'd love to do so in 1999. 
However, it's doubtful that I'll have time to make a 2500 mile round trip by
road.  Could someone offer any suggestions regarding the logistics of attending
the meet without driving there in your own vehicle?

Looking at my Rand McNally Road Atlas, I'd say that Jerome is in a pretty rural 
area.  Flagstaff appears to be a bit closer than Phoenix.  Is it possible to 
fly into Flagstaff?  Are there any motels at all close to Jerome?  If not, 
would the best option be to rent a car and sleep in either Flagstaff or 
Phoenix?  I guess it would also be possible to put together a tent and other
camping gear, and take it on the plane as checked luggage.

Please don't take this request as not being in the spirit of the Jerome meet 
--- getting there via type 2 requires a combination of free time, proximity,
and vehicle reliability that not everyone has, no matter how high their level
of interest.

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated, so I can plan a trip for next
year.  Probably there are some other folks as well who are in a similar
situation, and who would love to attend, but aren't able to drive out &amp; back. 

Thanks, Bill
