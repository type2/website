Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch cable tube replacement?

I had this happen to the 65 westy about 2-3  years ago when I was in Arizona. 
  I had a big end tranny boot clamp around, or two, and used those clamps to 
stick it back to the rear axle.  I meant to get it welded, but never did.  

This is the easy cheap fix.   you can spend more money and time if you like.

 hit a stone or something that flattened the tube just fwd of that.  I
 sectioned it so I could replace the cable, and jury-rigged something to
 hold the tube to the chassis, but ...
 
 Has anyone replaced their tube with steel tubing from the hardware store?
