&lt;&lt; well, I should be going to pick up my bus in a week or so and I have a
couple of
 questions. I got a bus tow bar from the fellow in Arizona so I'm all set
there, I was wondering if there is a problem towing the bus at highway speeds
( 65-75). I don't know how the reduction boxes will act at that speed. As long
as the trans is in nuetral should there be any problems ? I have to pick the
bus up in Virginia and tow it back to Michigan ( 600-650 miles).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
You will do better to go slower, and yes you need the tranny in nuetral.  Plus
make sure your tow vehicle is heavier than 2,000lbs., to keep the bus from
pushing you around.  Also you should jack up the rear wheels and check for
more than 1/16&quot; of up down wheel play measured at the axle nut.  If too loose
then replace the reduction gear bearings at least on that side.  Change the
tranny oil to help those tranny and reduction bearings get home and do this to
make sure that there is enough oil in there.  If there are any pieces of metal
in the oil from the reduction gear boxes bigger than a pin head and more than
a few of these, you might want to consider replacing those bearings on that
side reduction box.  Check for proper tightness of the rear axle nuts and the
lugbolts on the tires.  Take extra set of tires in case of bad ones on your
new VW.  Then jack up the front axle, grease the front zerk fittings, remove
the front wheel bearings and check the condition of those bearings before
repacking them with new grease.  We towed a bus once and found later that one
of the front wheel bearings was compleately ground up into metal dust.
Another couple of friends of ours have had the rear wheels fall off due to
loose axle nuts.   Both could have been avoided by checking things out and
only by luck did these situations not result to road accidents.    Eric &amp; Barb
