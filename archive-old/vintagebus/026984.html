Amen,
I am so paranoid about getting squashed I can barely change a tire, I've spent
hours underneath the back end of my bus and I always use a floor jack with two
jack stands under the frame, I'm still never really at ease, but at least I can
concentrate on what I'm doing.
Another safety tip; if at all possible, have somebody with you.
I know there are emergencies and situations where we are working under less
than ideal conditions, but always keep safety at the top of your priority list.
