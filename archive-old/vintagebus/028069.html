Subject: Re: [VB] (friday) the truth about our VW's

When I bought my 72 beetle, the salesman acted as if he could care less
about making the sale. Guess he saw me coming. He gave me a whopping $50
for the Ford.

But it certainly wasnt the worse car buying experience. When years later
I was looking for a small pickup, I wandered in a Dodge dealership where
they were asking for a $50 deposit for a test drive!!! I couldnt believe
it when they asked the dooood in front of me for it. When he walked, I
stood there open mouthed while he explained to the young trainee that
&quot;if they dont wanna leave the deposit, they arent serious&quot;. Here I was
standing there, so serious that I intended on leaving there that night
with a truck. I went down the street to the Nissan dealership and drove
home a new truck home that night.

But even worse was when I accompanied a female friend of mine to a Mazda
dealership when she wanted to buy a small pickup and the salesman said,
and I am not kidding. . .&quot;if you wanna buy a truck, come back with your
husband&quot;!!! Now I know that was grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.

Seems like the dealerships like to hire idiots.
