The FBI's official statement attributes that to &quot;swamp gas&quot;, Mulder.

Sorry, but I can't help but be skeptical of reports of &quot;I've found the rarest bus on
the face of the earth&quot; coupled with &quot;I'm not going to take any pictures of it, if you
want to see it I might take it to a show in washington&quot;

While I believe in the possibilty of extraterrestrial life, and barndoor binz buses,
I still need to see one to believe it.

&gt; the other one... I can't remember where.
