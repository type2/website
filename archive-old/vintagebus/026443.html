&gt; bottom line is get a
&gt; tach on it, and see where 3K rpms is, use that as your cruising speed.  
if you can only cruise at 3000 rpm safley in your bus, something is
wrong with your motor.  i always cruised my bus at 3600-3750 with no
trouble.

a properly built stock engine should be  able to cruise just under 4000
rpm all day long.  if it wants to run way hot from doing this, talk to
your rebuilder.  in 115 degree heat, i would get my 66 westy up to 240
(which is still a bit too toasty for me) after running 3800 rpm on the
freeway.  but, for that kind of outside air temp, i'll take it.

get those rpm's up so you can get your fan pushing out more pressure.

but hey, different strokes for different folks.  i personally prefer my
engine to always be driving between 3 and 4 K. unless idling of course.
