Robert,

The book states &quot;May 1958 to August 1961, normally with integral flashing
indicator when appropriate but here - on Australian - sourced vehicle -
unusually supplemented by separate indicator&quot;

The bus that is featured is a 1961 Double Cab # 735 673 owned by Simon Lewis.

BTW &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; is a great reference book.  About 45-50 percent
splittys.  ISBN # 1 870979 84 2  Printed by Bay View Books.

I have no affiliation with the book.

&gt;         Haven't got the book!  Does it say what year they were
&gt;         on Steve?  On thinking about it I think I was wrong before
&gt;         and while semaphores went to 59, the separate round amber
&gt;         rear indicators were only 60 and 61, with the oval amber/red
&gt;         combination starting in 62?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can take some pics of the amber hella round flat
&gt; &gt; &gt; lense with chrome bezel (phew!) if anyone would like
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or if you have the book &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; by Laurence Meredith, you can
&gt; &gt; look
&gt; &gt; on page 21 for a few pics of an Ausie DC and on page 38 for a close up of
&gt; &gt; said
&gt; &gt; tail lights.
