If you put on KYB's Gas-a-Just they will raise the rear of the vehical
anywhere for a quarter inch to 2 full inchs. These shocks have a heavy
Nitrogen charge and some pretty stiff valving, great shocks for a bus always
carrying a load, but may be to stiff for those that don't. KYB GR 2's are a
lighter nitrogen charged shock and will not raise a vehical and then you
also have CoFap (same as Boge and OEM to VW de Mexico), these are available
in a light nitrogen charge and also a standard oil filled configuration at a
lesser cost then the KYB's.

don't know where I'm staying Sat night for OCTO yet. Maybe Christmas tree
island with the VTO guys or the HB camp-out if I can find the direction
again. Don't forget the BBQ at West Coast Classics Saturday afternoon. If
you've never been there it's worth it. Lenny has some cool stuff there and
loves to take you on tours of his shop.

I had been running my bus for about 8 months with no shocks. I had
someone tell me that they had removed theirs and that it had handled
better. Mine handled fine , but I think it handles a little better on
the freeway, but not much different. The shocks I put on were KYB's and
I have noticed that all of a sudden I am getting more wear on the
outside of my rear tires. Let me know if you find anything to
substantiate that.
