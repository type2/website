Well I've successfully rebuilt my headlight bucket assemblies.  Besides
having the proper seals from WCM, I was able to do a couple things to help
save time and money.

#1 - after POR15 - I used a rattle can and a half of 75 cent primer.  They
look great!

#2 - I'm not sure of the size but the rubber tubing that the headlight
adjustment tongs slip into can be had in what I believe is the next smaller
size or 2 of tubing available in SAE under 1/4&quot;  I bought some line to
replace the windshield washer fluid pump lines and this stuff works GREAT as
a replacement for the original rubber bushings/grommets.

#3 - When cleaning the groove behind the headlight bucket on the front nose,
you can use the little plastic netting bags that grapes come in (kind of
like a hair net).  Dip it in hot soapy water and then just kind of twist it
up and work it behind the groove.  You can then clean it by sliding it back
and forth.  Worked absolutely wonderful!

#4 - Well I'm not sure - I'm going out right now to install the headlight
buckets so we'll see if I can find anything more worth talking about.
