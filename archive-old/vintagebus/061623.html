 Hi all,
    A friend of mine, not on the list, has a 65 Dormobile for 
 sale. As far as  I can tell, it has all the correct pieces, the seats 
 have been reupholstered, no engine at present. The front floors need 
 renewing, the rear cargo area are pretty good and the drivers side 
 rocker needs replacement. If you have any interest I would be willing 
 to go and check things for you, no digital camera, as it is in the 
 next town to me. He is asking $750/BO. Email me offlist and I can 
 check/pass your name along.
    Mike - 67 Deluxe
 
What does &quot;$750/BO&quot; mean? Is that what he's asking for the bus?
