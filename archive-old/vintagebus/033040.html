I agree with Thom ,,it depends on how much your willing to spend on it 
,,Robert is also rite as for frame damage but it appears to have been hit 
headlight high or so ,but cking the frame is the first thought ,,,if so you 
can still split the frame behind or just in front of the bulkhead,,but your 
call as to the feasiblity of that on this particular bus ,,on the 56 standard 
sunroof in the shop the owner optedto do that ,,his call not mine ,,i can fix 
most anything with-in reason and funds ,,GRIN ,,later
