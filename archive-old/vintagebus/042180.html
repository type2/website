&gt; Some of you may remember the strange, loud rattling noise my engine was making _at_ KP.

&gt; Scott and I stopped by the local VWFLAPS this weekend to pick up some misc spares 
&gt; for his trip home, and I had the guy listen to my engine.  He thinks my cam gear
&gt; rivets are toast.  By turning the gen pulley with a wrench, there's about 1/2&quot; of
&gt; &quot;play&quot; in the crank pulley, meaning you can turn it that far without significant
&gt; resistance.  Anyone ever had this problem before?

Sounds more like a broken crank or bad key on the crank pulley.  While the
cam does provide some resistance, the rods and pistons should provide
immediate resistance even if the cam was loose.
