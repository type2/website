Check the intake manifold boots.  They're hard to replace with the
engine in.

Replace all fuel lines and make sure the grommet through the tin is in
good shape (or replaced with something better)

Before you install the new clutch throw-out arm, weld the forks to the
shaft all the way around, this is a common failure point in VWs.  You
can just weld the old shaft up if you want to avoid the cost of a new
one.  Same strength either way.

 Also, what
&gt; is the best spline lube? Any helpful hints for re installing?

I use bosch distributor point grease.  It's nice and thick.  Use it
very sparingly!  This is also good pilot bearing lube.
