I was in the &quot;relaxed&quot; part of town yesterday with the wife and kids for
the street market there, while my wife was feeding the new baby a kid (ie
anyone under 40) came up and asked what year the bus was, told me about a
fellow in east San Diego (Volker?) who assembles 1918cc engines (too big, I
thought) with EIGHT QUARTS of oil in the system... I kept wondering, where
does he STORE that much oil? Would he need a reservoir/separate sump or
just keep it all in additional oil lines?

-----
3qts. engine oil, 3.5qt. sump, 1qt. filter.  That's what my 2L engine takes.
It was a surprise to me too.  Not quite 8, but close enough.

John
