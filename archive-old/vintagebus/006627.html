Charlie Hammil and Moe _at_ transporter gardens both have roto's, they attach
the buses at the bumper mounts, Charlie had a Barndoor in his and Moe had a
single cab in his, you should try to contact one of them , I'm sure either
would be happy to send you plans, or better yet just come down to the
classic and check them out in person.

I was thinking of making a rotissory contraption to better work on 
the underside of the bus.What is a good way to attach it to the 
bus?are the bumper bracket mounting holes strong enough?or do I 
need to attach it to the beam?or??
