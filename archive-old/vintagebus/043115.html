If you are missing page 107-110....I have them!  It is the section
covering/depicting carburetors and air cleaners...a must have for the
manual.  
E-mail me and send your address...I will send those pages out immediately.
It is an 11x17 fold-out sheet that was supposed to be hand collated....my
hand collating works well, but the brain wasn't I guess.
I apologize to those who are missing those pages but I have them ready to
send out to you!
I can receive mesages at    showell_at_i405_dot_com     if you like.
later
