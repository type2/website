Is there a difference is changing the tranny oil on a bus with reduction boxes
compared to another VW with out the boxes? Any tips for the tranny oil change
on a bus. I just got my 55 Westy to run today. All 36 horses fired up with an
oil change, new battery and a little bit of gas...Another one soon to be on
the road!!

Anyone with a single tip 36 hp muffler for sale...oh yeah those crazy bumpers
are missing too.
