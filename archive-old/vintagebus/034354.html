Has it been hit in the rear left corner?
A barn in Sao Paulo was pictured 
in Volks World (UK magazine)
quite a few months ago.  Abandoned,
hit in rear left, later tail lights, incorrect front doors.
Be interesting to know if its the same
bus or the same pix.

If it still there its been there a LONG time
now!

&gt; Just received a letter &amp; photo from a friend of mine --in it was picture
&gt; of a 53 Kombie--abandoned!! One side window gone--late style
&gt; tail-lights--showing some rust.
&gt; The 53 is in Sao Paulo, Brazil--you can see a free-way in the
&gt; background. Still has plates on it.--Me thinks the Vintage Type II crowd
&gt; is not that strong in the area?  The photo will appear in an upcoming
&gt; issue of the NEATO newsletter, OBR-- PS, it appears to be still a
&gt; &quot;roller&quot;---uncle jerry
