Hi,

It looks like my 55 Single Cab will be decorated as a float in the
German-American parade in downtown Chicago this September.  Ever see &quot;Ferris
Buehler's Day Off&quot;?  Thats the parade.  :-)

So on a more serious note I have a problem with my '66 1300 Kaefer that I am
somewhat baffled by.  I realize it is a typ 1 but some off you guys may have
experienced the same in your buses.  The engine runs great, does not consume
oil, cruises at 75mph and is an otherwise superb runner.  I notice that if I
park with the drivers side tilted to the left, such as on a street with a
pronounced road crown, I get oil smoke upon startup, which clears itself
after running.  If the car is level or tilted to the right I have no
problem..never.  Somehow oil is leaking into the cyl but the valves are so
high up on VW that I dont see how it could sneak in through the valves.
Suggestions??

Paul Leske
