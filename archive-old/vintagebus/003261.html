Woohoo!  Yippee!  Stoked!

We're gonna get a new family member today.....checked it out yesterday after
downloading some rather large emails, which turned out to be the pics I
requested the day before from a guy in this general area who had advertised
on Everett's site.  Yup, he still has it, he said, and after looking at the
pics, I called him up.  This is a '66 hardtop Westy walkthrough, which has a
great interior and a straight body...although it has green and white house
paint which is peeling.......does Jasco work?  Or will it kill the layers
underneath?  Anyway, the bus rides nicely, and stops.....the engine feels
good, but sounds like it wants some love.  The major problem with this
beastie is that the tranny: once warmed up to full operating temperature,
does not like shifting into first or second.  I am thinking that this could
be a seizing problem with the synchros, and also possibly a symptom of what
happens when you use the wrong gear oil.  There are bad seals under there,
but I am going to try to make it work with a full flush and change.....with
GL-4, right?

I'll post more when I get the thing home (tonight), and there will be a
couple pics on Thom's site (Thanks, Thom).....

It's a nice bus, we're thinking, and we are who we are (we being all of us
bus pilots) because we're not scared of tranny problems....oh, and a
chattering clutch that probably relates to the dark, slick mess on the
tranny and engine.....

Still....we're stoked!

Later!

Gene
