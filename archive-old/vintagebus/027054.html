Subject: Swing lever repair for lunch

Monday, I installed a swing lever kit on my baby. This went very
smoothly, easier than I expected.

I knocked out the upper bushing with a hammer and flat punch, then
pressed out the lower bushing with a homemade puller made from a long
bolt, fender washers, assorted sockets and nut. I pressed in the new
bushings with the same hardware.

I don't have a Bentley, but figured the grease grooves in the bushings
went with the open ends towards the grease nipple. The bushings I pulled
out were NOT installed this way. I have to wonder if they were original,
or if some PO installed them incorrectly...

My steering is MUCH better now. I still have a little bit of play, but
it seems to coming from my steering box. I still need to adjust the drag
link to center my steering wheel (it's about 20 degrees off).

Next project (hopefully tomorrow) is to install a slightly used 1776
into my bus, then fix an exhaust leak on my old engine so I can install
it into my daughter's 72 SB this Saturday...

Work, work, work...

david
