Thom,
Dont be a pussy! Grab a jar of peanut butter, a loaf
of bread, a knife, sleeping bag, six pack &lt;jolt&gt; and
hit the freeking road! What are you some kind of guy
who shows up to bus events in a *VOLVO* ? Sleep in the
bus even if it means sleeping up right. Take the
friday and monday off. Tell the boss to pound it
seeing as you closest relative &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot; is ill.
It's a family thing, a meeting of the tribe. Break
loose with a few of those eBay trinkets to offset the
weekend expenses. Do you think that all of those big
shots do it all out of their pockets? Pffft! wake up!
Fahgitaboutit! We do the 16 hours straight because we
choose to! Sleep in the bus because we have to. We
crawl up the grapevine and/or Indio hills because they
are there.
See you there, woosey! ;-)
-ellis
54 Barnambulator, at the OCTO
