Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator question EMERGENCY

Hi Denis,
Have you checked your ground cables?  Have you soldered together the riveted 
parts of your head light switch?  Have you soldered the the brass clips 
inside the fuse box together?  Have you checked the voltage with a voltmeter 
all the way through the wiring system to see where droppage could occur?
