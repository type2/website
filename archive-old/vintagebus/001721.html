Hi all-

A quick thanks for all of you who have helped me get the parts I've been =
looking for in the past - what a great group! But guess what? I'm on the =
search again and for those of you packing up your parts to take to the =
shows- maybe I'll save you a trip - I won't be able to make it to the =
Sac swap since my hubby is racing at Sears Point this weekend and don't =
you know that this was a pick'm decision!=20

Anyway, my bus has been naked too long and would like it's trim back - =
some p.o. filled in the holes and what not way back when &amp; I'd like to =
fix that. So, side peices, including the bottom bits, bumper trims and =
front-v.=20

If you've got the parts sitting around - I'll save you some garage space =
! :) Or if you've got the mind to save me part of a stash you find, drop =
me a line. I'm in the SF bay area, but will pay shipping or will pick-up =
depending on where it is.

Hope you all have a grand weekend!
- Melissa
