 Nope, should bolt right up.  I had this setup in my '56 bus.

Its been  about 3 years since owning a splitty...I am glad this flywheel 
setup will work, it will allow me to get behind the wheel a bit sooner.  Now 
if anyone has a 6v 200 mm one laying around, I can trade you another flywheel 
for it plus $$$$$!
