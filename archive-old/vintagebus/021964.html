 ...Having been a westy freak for many years I have come across the &quot;shrinking
plastic trim&quot;
 more then enough times...here is what I have done on many a bus with great
results
 
 I found...
 -that if you carefully remove the very stiff deformed plastic...
 -boil a large (as you can) pot or basin of water
 -remove the water from the heat
 -slowly emerge the stiff plastic into the hot hot!! water
 -as the plastic hits the water you will find it slowly becomes very soft and
pliable again!!
 -all of the warped and deformed sections should smooth right out!!
 -the plastic is now very very pliable and can be stretched...... if shrunk
from years of sun
 damage
 -I use a light coat of epoxy in the grooves on cabinets were the trim goes
 -then quickly stretch and fit the plastic trim into place
 -a couple helpers maybe good to hold the trim in place while it cools
 -act quickly, as when the trim cools it will rear harden into whatever shape
it current holds
 -NOTE you can do this to a piece of trim as much as you want if you find you
were not quick
 enough with your application &gt;&gt;

I have used a 'heat gun', sort of a heavy duty hairdryer to get the same
results.  An advantage is you can apply heat as you insert the trim. I haven't
used glue- although that may help if the groove in the cabinet has splinters
broken off it.   Using the heat to remove the trim helps with reducing
splinterage.  But, the idea of hot water may be good to clean the trim up-
using laundry detergent or whatever.   The heat gun is helpful for removing
the plastic trim from the cabinets, as well.  I have replaced missing trim
from baywindow westies in junkyards, also.   Though some of it is a thicker,
so beware.   And I have heard you can get new plastic trim from RV places,
think Van Bondo was saying that when he was finding bits for the Resto
FromHell.   It may just be my OPBO, But Ithink the white is a nice contrast,
better than chrome.
