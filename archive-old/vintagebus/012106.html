Subject: Transmission Info.

As a rule did commercial vehicles ,ie  SC, DC and panels  have a
different transmissions then other  type IIs ? By different I mean ..
ring &amp; pinions, reduction boxs and  gears.  If so, can this be found on
the M tag.  I have looked at many &quot;commercial vehicle&quot; M tags and have
NO  info on transmissions. But. I have driven many of these type IIs
over the years and always felt that they were geared lower. .
	I have made my own chart on 57 to67 transmissions and the changes year
to year.There were many !  But  no way to tell on which bus any or all
changes were made.
