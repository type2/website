Having just reconditioned a set of original safaris
you can appreciate why the double wall or channel
is there.  It's just not strength and to hold the seal - the 'bottom' of the
channel is designed to act as a drain which conducts
water to the drain holes in the bottom corners of the
windows?

Repro safaris are more like original pop-out windows.
Given OG safaris seem to be in *much* better condition
than pop-out windows of the same age the design looks like
it works well....

I'd be interested in knowing how repro safaris hold up
over time (5 years or so), particularly if made from steel
as opposed to something like marine grade stainless.  I suppose
one plus is that coating technologies have improved...

1. OG safaris with the so called double walled frames are made from 1 piece
of steel rolled in a multi stage process theat creates the inner channel.
That is the reason no repop Safaris have this. To expensive to make the
tooling. That is amother reason why Dave at CE uses tempered glass instead
of laminated. He has found that with the laminated glass the repop frames
(everyones) flex to much thus cracking the laminated glass. he feels the
tempered can take more flex.
