Subject: RE: Gauges in the bus

I've put a lot of thought into gauges since I've been doing my bus.
I came up with the same idea as vvvince with some differences.

Some of the things I wanted was cyl head temp, oil temp, oil pressure,
and certainly a tach.  I looked at the cover plate on the air box.  There
is 
enough space to put a 3 1/8&quot; VDO tach with a couple of small gauges on
either side.  Since my head liner is out I can run my wiring in the roof
tray and down the support pillar by the rear seat ( or bed as the case may
be).

There are a few considerations.  Like waterproofing in the air box, and
insuring
the airbox isn't obstructed by the gauges.  And then VDO suggest the cyl
temp
shouldn't be more than 14 ft from the sensor.

For waterproofing, I got a guy to vacuum mold a thick plastic cover that
fits
exactly over the back of the airbox cover.  It has enough room to house the
back 
of the tach at the top and bevels to the smaller gauges at the bottom.  The
sensor
wire ( a multiconductor that has all signals in one case, with some extras
for the
future) passes through a grommet about 1/2&quot; above the turn at the bottom. 
I could 
add a switch or two, a couple of idiot lights, or something else that needs
to be 
handy.

As for the obstruction to the airbox, since I didn't make it an air dam it
&quot;looks&quot;
like it will work like a peido tube, may even get a little faster air speed
through the 
box.

14 ft is a hard one.  This is due to the resistance of the wire over the
distance.
The longer the distance, the less accurate the reading.  This is only a
consideration
for the cyl head temp.  I have the VDO guy checking this out for me to give
some insight to options.

This set up actually looks pretty good, in my hand.  I haven't actually put
it
in the air box hole but ...

I might even make this a kit if anyone was interested.

&gt; Just a thought on putting gauges in the parcel tray. Gauges are good for
&gt; giving you more information and to do that they need to be reasonably
easy to
&gt; notice. the further that they are away from your sight line, the less you
will
&gt; notice them while driving and the less good that they will do. I am six
foot
&gt; one, and with some 50 year old eyes and presbiopia, the parcel tray would
be
&gt; in terra incognita for me.
