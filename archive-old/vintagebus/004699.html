Subject: Re: [VB] Engine ID Number?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just opened the engine compartment of my 67 deluxe and could not believe
it ! My engine has the same ID number. It came from a ´74 thing and was
original. Your engine must be a illegal repro !!!

stefan

67 deluxe
62 bug
72 moto guzzi nuovo falcone


&gt; I was wondering if anyone had a reference sheet that could look up and
&gt; engine ID number and tell me what year and model this engine came from?
The
&gt; number is 1-4-3-2.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your assistance.
