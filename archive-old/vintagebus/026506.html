Subject: Hosed rear axle threads. Got any?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 166.68.134.174

Hello, list.

Let me try this again; I think I sent it to the wrong address...

I have a '65 camper (of some as yet determined variety) and I
have pureed the threads on the driver's side big nut rear 24 tooth rear axle
stub (it still hurts too badly to explain how. Moral: never rush your work).
I have 1 and 3/32 inches in diameter of material left on it. Do I dare to
take it to a machine shop to re-thread it to a smaller nut of some variety?
Intuitively, that seems like a bad idea to me, but if it's safe to do, I'll
give it a shot.

Otherwise, does anyone have a good 24 tooth big nut stub axle
lying around they want to unload? I'll take a whole reduction box if you
don't wanna take it apart.

Much thanks.

Michael
