I have a set date '58

I think this is one of those excruciating AR details.  I frequently see
people with cars for sale, and include the wheel dates.  Does it matter?
So long as they're the type of wheels that the car is supposed to have, ie
14&quot; wheels on you '67 instead of 16&quot;

Some of these cars that I've seen that have the &quot;correct&quot; wheels as a
selling point didn't have much else to stand on, as it were...

&gt;jp told me one time that as far as he could determine the crows foot rims
were outfitted on commercial type2s for just one or two years - '63 and '64
i think.  he said he'd not found any information that stated whether the
rims were installed both front a rear or just rear.  his truck now sports a
complete set (including spare) though his truck's production isn't within
the years these rims were used.  is this information of jp's inaccurate?
is there some source that has the specifics?
