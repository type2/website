btw the reserve lever knob thing is good, I know I have
about 20 or 30 miles left when I have to pull it.     And
useful when pulling the motor as you can  switch the lever
to &quot;off&quot;.
&gt;
Someone told me once that it's bad for the fuel pump to let
it run with little or no gas, like when you run out/cut out
and have to switch to reserve.

Opinions?

I find it easier just to fill up every 200 miles, it's easy
to watch the speedo for 000,200,400,600,800.  Of course,
I'm cruising with 25 mpg, yours may differ.

'55 Kombi - Ran it to 250 miles on a tank once, it started
to cut out so I shut off the engine, coasted down an
off-ramp, through a green light, and right into a Circle K.
 Stopped right at the pump.  :)
