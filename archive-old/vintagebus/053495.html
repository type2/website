&lt;&lt; anyways, the piston was a little scored, and was also the short kind, 
similar to the pressure control piston. i replaced it with a 'vw' stamped one 
that has the deep groove near the top, and is longer (they look like the 
weights you put on an old-fashioned scale!). &gt;&gt;

Hi Craig,
You do not want to use the piston with the groove in it unlees you live/drive 
in a enviroment that barely and hardly ever goes below 70F.
