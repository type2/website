I know of a trailer made form a 52 barndoor bus form bulkhead back.
Poor bus.

&lt;&lt;Andy in Yuma, Az. has a trailer made out of a double cab bed with 2 rear

gates on it. Also a couple of years ago at the Classic weekend there was a

trailer made out of a splitty just like the bay one. At Vegas a few years

back there was a trailer made out of the back half of a bus. Wait till you

see VW Howards latest trailer when he gets it done! to pull behind his

chopped top single cab.
