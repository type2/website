Subject: re:door opening on the move

I replaced the door rubber on my bus two summers ago, the doors wouldnt shut
flush anymore(previously they did) and i had purchased this rubber a good 6
months previous to installation.  I ended up going back to the original
rubber, which seal ok but is really compressed a lot in spots(such that the
metal hits metal sometimes when shutting.

when does rubber shrink...does it not shrink until applied? I assumed if you
bought seals, then kept them for a while exposed, not all sealed up ina
plastic bag that htey should do theirnatural shrinking. so wait a couple
months then install. this didn't seem to work for me.
