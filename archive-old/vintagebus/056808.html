&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 So why wouldn't this wheel fit?

 It is a 15x7 stock steel wheel for 68- busses. A low enough profile tire 
 shouldn't have a problem on the front.

I think they don't mention 67 &amp; earlier buses as they are vanagon oriented, 
and may not realise that splitties exist.
  I am sure you could bolt those wide 15&quot; rims on your splitty- dunno about 
clearance though.  Might have  to cut the rear wheel wells.   The offset 
looks dif than for the stock rims.      I tried putting Porsche 356 rims on 
the back of my 61 and the offset is not like the VW rim and it didn't clear 
the wheel well.   Oh- ya those are not stock bus 15&quot; rims- the stock bus 15&quot; 
rims are 4.5 &quot; wide and have 4 sort of rectangular slots. ( the size is 
stamped on the rim under the hubcap area)  kind of 'stock custom style' i 
guess.
