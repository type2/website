&gt; &gt;Ok...I just got my safari's from California.  As I
&gt; &gt;look at the bill, I see that I was charged $35 on a
&gt; &gt;$425 order.  When I called up Izz, I was told they
&gt; &gt;must charge everyone tax, unless shipped to AZ.  I've
&gt; &gt;never paid out of state tax before in my life over
&gt; &gt;mail order.  Whats the story?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You've been had.  Demand a refund of the sales tax.
&gt; 

I wouldnt ASSUME that so quick. Mail orders to florida are SUPPOSED to
charge sales tax and send it to the state but most don't bother with it.
Do you KNOW the law in this case?
