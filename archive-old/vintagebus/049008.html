Karl sez:
&gt;An even easier way to adjust valves:
&gt;Turn engine in direction of rotation. When exhaust valve JUST starts to
&gt;open, adjust intake. Rotate engine, watch exhaust open then close, watch
&gt;intake open then close. JUST as the intake closes, adjust the exhaust.
&gt;Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. Takes longer to R + R valve covers than
&gt;to adjust. Don't need to watch dist. rotor or timing mark.

Karl and I share a neighborhood and more, and he's told me about this method. I'll have to take a few beers to his place and watch that 8' long gorilla arm reach up and turn the engine while watching the valves open. It's gotta be that, or he's got gorilla feet to pull that wrench.
