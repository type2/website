&gt;i am hoping to go over to my cousins(a mechanic) he has this stethoscope
&gt;thing with a rod on the end. you touch the rod to different parts of the
&gt;engine to locate where noises are coming from.

You can do this with a dowel rod.  Hold one to the engine and the other
end *to* your ear - please, not _in_ your ear, engines vibrate.  I usually
put it on my cheek right in front (FRONT) of my ear.  I've done this
before and it really does work.

&gt;in my notes i took when dismantling the starter relay to move into the
&gt;engine compartment i noted that connection 86 was the ground.

The &quot;official&quot; VW and Bosch spec is that 85 is the coil ground and 86
is the coil supply.  95% of all automotive relays will work fine if
you hook them up the other way around.  The ones that won't have a
diode across the coil to stop voltage spikes when the relay is switched
off, and on those you have to hook up the coil correctly.  Bosch tends
to use a resistor across the coil for this purpose instead of a diode,
so it doesn't matter which way you hook them up.  (If you hook up a
relay with a diode backwards, the relay won't work and the circuit
supplying the coil will see nearly a dead short.)

Even if yours has a diode, hooking up the coil backwards shouldn't make
the fuse blow.  The fuse is for the contacts, not the coil.

&gt;i guess when i took the solenoid out to clean the contacts (while engine
&gt;was out) i put it back in incorrectly.

Maybe your rattle was that arm flopping around.

&gt;anyway i straightened out the solenoid to starter connection. now i get at
&gt;least a whir our of the starter when i turn the key. although it doesn't
&gt;really sound like the engine is actually turning over.

Convert your Bus to electric drive.  In other words, put it in gear and
step off the clutch when you turn the key.  If the starter is turning
the engine your Bus will move.

&gt;could i have done some permanent damage to the starter by sticking the
&gt;solenoid in incorrectly??

I don't think so.  I think the worst thing that might have happened
is that the starter teeth would have hit the flywheel at the wrong
time, but if that was happening you'd know it.  It would screech like
it does when you try to start it when it's already running.
