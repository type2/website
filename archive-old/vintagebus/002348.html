Hey Rex
&gt;
&gt; Figured out that my wiper arms are probably from a bug. They still do
&gt; the job. It doesn't rain here hardly ever and I probably won't be
&gt; driving the bus on bad days. Just need to pass inspection.
&gt;


When I was running my 6 volt wiper motor on 12 volts it was really wrong!
Those arm things kept popping off and the wiper moter made horrendous noise.
Once I rigged up the voltage drop the arms never pop off and the motor is
really quiet - only problem now is that the wipers move to slow to keep the
windsield clear - ah well - at least I can hear the 8-tracks. ;)
