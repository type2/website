Subject: RE: [VB] FW: headlight globes

Sounds like he needs some euro headlight bulbs..

I can measure mine to see if they are about the same. Maybe he can
confirm that this is what he's talking about:

Anybody?

Subject: headlight globes


Dear Sir/Madam,

I e-mailed the other day (30th January) regarding headlight globes
for an old Kombi (Type II - 1957 or 1958, I'm not sure of the exact
year).

The Globe is an OSRAM Bilux 7324/1 6V 35/35W Exp vkx

I have taken some measurements of the it (below) and perhaps, with
these, you will be able to find if there are any currently available.

Overall height of globe:  ~2 1/2&quot; (62 mm)

Height of glass: 1 5/8&quot; (40 mm)
Diam of glass: 1 3/8&quot; (35 mm)

Height of metallic base: 7/8&quot; (22 mm)
Diam of metallic base: 3/4&quot; (20 mm)

Two contacts on the base

Two &quot;lugs&quot; (?correct term for these bits that make for the bayonet-fit),
1/2&quot; up from the base, and thus 3/8&quot; down from top of metallic base
(I thought, incorrectly, from memory that they were offset, but they
are not).

One lug is 3/16&quot; wide, one is 1/8&quot; wide;
both stick out - horizontally - from the base ~1/8&quot; (2 mm).

I am down to only three of the four beams working now.  If one more
beam goes on the already-bung globe the Kombi will be off the road
(because of having only one headlight)!

I await you reply in anticipation, thanks.

Noel Kemp
