Hi volks, 
Good point!  All too true for any engine, tranny, or other major part that 
you have to have shipped to you.  
  All new engines are nice , and if you go that way Ronnie is probably the 
best way to get that.  But remember that these engines are being built by by 
assemblers in Mexico who probably are getting $.80 or less an hour so they 
may not do a good job.  Which is why we know of a few of these engines having 
prolems, including having the cam installed 180 degrees out!  While having a 
engine rebuilt by a small shop does not mean you will not have a problem with 
it, it means you should have much less of a chance of having problems due to 
good shops will inspect the parts, and take more time to assemble them 
correctly.  We have heard rumor that the new Mexican cranks are cast not 
forged.  Which unless the alloy process has hugely improved since the 1970s 
means cranks that might break more often.  Plus you can not order internal 
modifictaions to improve the engine, but have to dissassemble it, and install 
them when you get it.  Which of course will void any warrenty you had!

PS Interestingly we have been finding a few oil passages not completely 
drilled through (Especially to the lifters.) in dual relief engines from 
Germany made in the 1970s.  During this time we understand from volks who 
bought a type 1 from the factory in the 70s most of the workers at the 
wolfburg factory were from Iran, and other third world countries.  The german 
workers had slowly, but surely for the most part left due to wages not 
keeping up with the times which again in turn was probably due to VW planning 
on the type 1, and it's engine out of production.  Thus quality was probably 
not quite as important as in the 1950s-60s.
   From what we understand the type 1, and thusly it's engine is on the way 
to the end of production soon in Mexico now!  Quality is probably going to 
suffer again, if it is not already.   Eric&amp;Barb
