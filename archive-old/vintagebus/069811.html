One easy way to make a screen for the area, would be to cut the front tin
into a sort of frame, then attatch the screen to it depending on what you
used for screen material.  I think expanded metal would be the best bet if
you were looking for longetivity. Actually, you could make the front tin out
of expanded metal completely, with just tabs where it secured to the rest of
the tin.
