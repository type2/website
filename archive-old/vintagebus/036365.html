&gt; Does anyone know of a source for fog light bulbs?  I need both 6V and
12V.
&gt; 
&gt; One style I need looks similar to a dual filament tail light bulb at
the base, but has a flat ring around it (like Saturn) with three
bayonet connector type of holes.  This one says Asahi (I think they
made my camera too) and is labeled as a 6V/35/35W.  I think it has two
35 watt filiments.  I saw a similar bulb in some turn signals butchered
onto one of my buses and it was labeled as a Mazda bulb.  Did the
Japannese make 6V fog lamps?  
&gt; 
&gt; The other type is used in two different styles of Bosch lights I
bought.  They look like single filiment turn signal bulbs, except twice
the size.  They have metal tabs, rather than the standard round nubs to
align them.  The ones I have are 6V 35W, but I would like to have both
6V and 12V if I can find them. 
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows of a place that carries these, or can point me in the
right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Richard

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;wally world&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; except the 6 volt which 
i have coming for my fog lights
