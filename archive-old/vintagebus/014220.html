Hello Volks,

I am new the vintage bus scene and I just purchased a 61 Kombi (major 
project since the bus is in michigan...  i.e. RUST) and also ran across a 
12V gas heater (NO RUST).

The sticker on the heater reads:

INSTANT HEATER
manufactured for
Volkswagon of America, Inc.
V.W. Model vw 256-369
MFD. BY
Stewart-Warner Corporation
South Wind Division
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA
Model 8349B    12 Volt   Serial Number 2904

Can anyone tell me where I can find technical info on this heater.  
Specifically what it takes to wire up and get it running.   Also, does 
anyone know what this type of heater is worth?  Does this type of heater 
work well? It obviously was not a option on the 6V 61 Kombi that was 
purchased with it but would still possibly like to use it in a future 
project (If I can figure out how the darn thing works).

Thanks for the help

Mike
