Ok Colin...I have had enough of the non help you gave me when I asked in a 
nice way. I have had enough of the insults you have posted to the list. I 
have had enough of the lies you have told me and posted to the list. As I 
stated before, I have the proof you lied and I have the proof I was very 
upfront about the buggy I traded. Remember, I was the one that drove 900 
miles round trip...I was the one that paid for the gas up there and back...I 
was the one that had to pay for a motel room (at South of the Border).  I 
was the one that sent ever picture I had of the buggy and from you, I only 
got one. I was the one that offered up any and all kinds of info on the 
buggy, but I got vague answeres on the bus.

For those who wish to decide who is the looser of this mess, please see the 
note below and remember the post that Colin made yesterday...He said he/Earl 
traded a bus with NO title. I also attempted to talk with Colin/Earl by 
emails, but they would never return any of them. So now they find themselfs 
emailing lies to all over the world.

And yes, I did try to resolve this myself...I was in contact with the states 
of NC, FL, GA, AL, TN, KY, SC, and even Virgina I think. None of them had 
the bus on record.

                                                 colin
I HAVE ONE ON MY WEB THAT I WILL SEND YOU. It acually is a late 1963 w/
big back window. I lowered the van one notch in the back and only two
inches in the front. It is not very low but it is level. There is not
really muchto say about it. I bought it from my best freint so he could
by his wife a nice Christmas present this pass Christmas. So it has not
been driven in two months. We got a 1966 van that donated its front
skin
to save another bus and took of all the new break lines and hoses and
drums and break shoes, so the brakes are supurb!  It still has the
divider. The inside is empty no interior just like it came stock in 63
with grey finish. It is green BUT the guy I bought it from and myself
spray bombed it with spray cans, knowing one day we would paint it
anyway because he paints 18 wheelers for a living. I sold the motor out
if it. I do not want to make it sound like it is a show winner because
it is not but it is solid and he drove it everyday to work down I-95
for
a year and a half. I do not know whwt kind of info you are looking for
but it hope this helps. I am willing to trade it for a Dune Buggy body
on a shortened pan or a 1969-74 standard bug in decent shape. **** Ends up, 
its NOT a 63, but a 66****

vw911


yes i have pics before we spray bombed it when it was all green. I can
get reprints and send them to you if you would like. The back two
corners will need to be replaced down the road I have two good corners
off a 66 bus that come with the deal. no surface rust on the body. Had
to weld some metal in the floors when we first got it but that is taken
care of now. The van is pretty solid no rust in the usual places except
the back two corners.**** By the way, I NEVER did get these corners***

David I need your full name F-M-L before 4pm today Colin is getting to
title notorized for the van. **** Hmmm...and didnt he just post to the list 
that he didnt have a title???*****

vw911

When I go back to Fay. I will have to find some kind of crates to put
them in to ship them , They are very large.**** Hmmmm...and i have yet to 
see them*****

vw911

*****this is after I got back home with the van...you would think such a VW 
lover would know or atleast find out where the VIN number was...unless you 
already knew it was not the correct title*****


hey just got ome from atlanta,This all boggles me???/I never questioned
any of the info on the vin #'s because the tittle came back good.And
unlike in florida we do not have to search out the vin. #'s even thugh
I
did look for them but not with serious determination like u mst have.
    No the condoms are not mine unless tey sat skin fantasies tattoo
shop then thy are mine.If they do say that o them don't use them they
break pretty easy ,I think they are for show only...ha ha
                    Colin

**** And I did try to get the title by contacting the NC DMV *****

Good Afternoon Mr. Engle,

I am having to pull some microfiche records covering the history of
this
van.  I will advise you as soon as the copies are brought to me.
Thank you in advance.
Connie Bullock
Vehicle Registration Section

****....and again he states he got a title....I even asked what junkyard it 
was gotten out of, but Colin would not tell me*****

no you are ot getting what I told youwas in the state of nc the way
things work was they come out and do all that stuff if you were in that
situation like i was with a bug I owned hat story had nthng to do with
my van that tittle came with that van that I got outof a junk yard .Do
you understand now?Hope I answered your question...



***** And AGAIN he said he had a title *******

Well if I were you I would just attemt to register the tittle that came
with the van.I do not see how the state of florida can make you bring a
vehicle to the license office when the vehicle is not tagged to be
driven anyways.That sounds like a load of crap.If that is true and that
isn't the way they bond a car then I would look into bonding the car
,call dmv and ask them what you do in the case of a vehicle that has a
lost tittle and was in a junk yard for a long time how do you do a
tittle search and apply for a tittle.I'm sure it would involve in
getting a notorize letter from the person you traded it from and where
the vehicle came from and how it made it's way into your hands.It may
only involve you writtting where you got it from ......but I had a guy
say to me he did do that in florida before,but I really think the
tittle
you have should be good enough.

**** And all I had been asking was where the bus came from and could he help 
me get the correct title since NC seems to be a lot easier to deal with than 
FL*****

I believe I have about all the run around bs talk and the smart
comments from you as i am going to put up with.I don't like you
insinuating questions.I'm sorry for getting in the middle of your trade
to start with.

***and this is another not refusing to help me with the title***

my communication with you is finished If you feel like the deal with
earl is not what you want i suggest you drive back up here and get the
untittled buggy back from him.I am tired of your messages and will not
correspond with you any longer after all I did not trade you this
vehicle.You did nt get this vehicle at my house,so you did not recieve
it from me..


***** and I have the notes I sent to Colin/Earl....The document talked about 
is the paperwork from Colin to get a new title since he couldnt find 
his....looked all legal and notorized....very believable*****

Hy guys

Well, I found the hidden place on the van where the VIN numbers are stamped 
into the metal. Unlike the little tin plates, this one would have to be 
ground off. If indeed the number written on this document is the VIN number 
that shows on the title, its proof that that title and this van do not go 
together. So, that title isnt worth anything except for toilet paper as far 
as me getting it registered here in Florida. As you can see, the number 
written on the document is 1119338. The correct VIN number stamped into the 
metal of the bus is 216078245 just as the little tag behind the passenger 
seat says. This also proves that it was made Dec of '65 and is infact a '66 
and not a '63 as again, shown on the document.

You said NC was easy to get a title for, so what if I get that VIN number 
documented on a legal form and notorized? If not, this van is nothing more 
than a parts van and I didnt drive 915 miles round trip for a parts van.

David

****  HERE is what my insulting message to him said...I think I asked kinda 
nice for some help, dont you ?******

Ok, thats what I asked in the first place. Where did the title come from. So 
are you telling me that the junkyard gave you that title to the van and all 
you did was transfer it into your name?

So now this van is IN the same situation as your bug was. Nothing on the 
title matches the bus so its useless. It is not a '63, but a '66 and the VIN 
numbers are not even close.  What can be done to get the correct title?

David

****I am getting a little ticked off at this point****

Collin,

For some reason I get the feeling you are avoiding the situation. I told you 
before that Florida checks the VIN number on the title against the VIN 
number on the vehicle if its from out of state. Instate is just sign and 
send in. I did call the FL DMV and told them I was looking into getting a 
car, but I didnt know who it was last titled in. They said they could run 
the VIN number, but if its from out of state, they couldnt tell me anything. 
It might be possible to get a police officer to run the VIN number, but I 
would have to contact the last person it was titled to. I asked, what if I 
cant get ahold of that person and they lady told me there was nothing could 
be done.

Unlike you have told me of NC where they come out and run the VIN number for 
you, Florida is quite strict when it comes to this stuff. I knew all of this 
before and told you this when we talked while waiting for Earl.

I have already contacted the NCDMV and they are going to look at the 
microfische on the VIN number thats on the bus. I just dont understand how 
you could get a title for a vehicle and it not have the same number on the 
bus, even if you got the VIN tag from another bus and used it. Atleast it 
would be the same. I think we both have been around cars long enough to 
understand that the VIN number must match the title.

David

****...he accused me of trading a buggy with not title...yet they KNEW it 
didnt*****

Earl,

You have told me more info on the van/title in one email than Colin has in 
three. Florida is the same way if the title is an instate one. They could 
care less, but out of state is a different story. I dont know what the 
difference is.

As for being in the same situtation on the titles, you are in better shape 
than me. From Colins description of what can be done, NC is willing to help 
you get one. Florida will just sit there and type in a number to see if its 
registered IN Florida. If its out of state, you have to go to THAT state and 
find who last owned it. Then you have to contact them and get paper work 
done BY the last owner. IF you can not find out what state its from or get 
ahold of that person, they tell me there is nothing they can do.

Also, before I even left here, you asked me if the buggy had a title. I told 
you it didnt. I on the other hand was told one thing and given another. The 
numbers on that plate do mean something, otherwise VW would not have put 
them on there. Am I correct? If you/Colin would have kept asking to find out 
what those numbers did mean, you would have found out by someone that they 
not only told you what it came with, but infact that the VIN number was 
there. Between gas, lodging and the tire I had to buy, I spent well over 
$200. I have been talking to the NC DMV and they are going to do a search 
for me on the van, so if that costs me like you say it will, I will have 
spent a lot more on getting the correct title.

I dont remember what the numbers are on the pan. If you send them to me, I 
can tell you for sure. I assume neither of you know how to check this?
If not, maybe you two need to learn. Title not equaling the VIN number is 
against the law.

Colin asked me about the numbers on his crewcab so he will know if he has 
the correct title. I can decifer them if he sends them to me, or atleast I 
will give it a shot.

David


**** This note showes I was getting frustrated and NO help from them****

Excuse me? I took it that you were the VW expert? I said I had only been 
around them for a few years. Ask me about VIN numbers for Studebakers and I 
can tell you in my sleep. I assumed since you were a diehard VW fan, you 
knew a LOT more about them than I did. I took it in good faith that you knew 
what you were talking about as far as the VIN number went. I had no idea at 
the time I was at your house as to where the VIN numbers were on a bus. 
Again, I assumed you were the expert. I guess I was wrong. I dont know if 
its because you dont care about numbers matching or the state of NC doesnt. 
Either way, I took the 450 miles trip on good faith. I know now where to 
find the numbers and will not be so stupid as to trust anyone. And yes, bugs 
I can tell you where to find numbers and how to decifer them.

As far as your statment about insulting questions go, I think that asking 
you where the title came from in the first place isnt insulting.
Infact, in your last 3 or 4 emails, you still havnt told me the story as to 
where the title came from. If you were me, wouldnt you be very curious? I 
did get an email from Earl this morning. In it he told me where the title 
did come from. Now I know thanks to him and he wasnt even the one I asked.

I have just been asking simple questions and wether you like it or not, you 
are more than in the middle of this. Your name and signature is on this 
docutment I have. I was trying to be nice and ask questions, advide and 
help. So far you have given me none of that, so I may be forced to not be so 
nice in this matter if it comes down to it.

If you call asking for where the title came from, how NC does titles when 
none is received and asking for you help, BS, then any questions that NC ask 
you will be worse. By not answering my simple questions, you have forced me 
to take other routes to find the answer.

Im sure that even though Florida is more strict on things, the law is the 
law when it comes to VIN number matching the title. If they dont match, the 
vehicle does not belong to you. If for some reason a police officer runs the 
VIN number and finds it was stolen, I'm sure they wouldnt take the &quot;I didnt 
know where the VIN number was located&quot; story very well. I took it upon 
myself to learn and have done so. Now, with or without your help, I will get 
the correct papers. Since I have not had your help in this matter, I will 
get NC to help me. I sure they will want the paper you signed and they can 
decide on what to do with it and you.

David

****** Again, I asked in a nice way ****

Colin,

Where is the junkyard the bus came from and do you have the name of it. Also 
the phone number for it.

Thank you,
David


*****Getting more angry at his NON help******

Colin,

I have tried to be nice and ask questions in a nice way. You have left me 
with no choice than to pursue things in a differnet way. As far as the law 
goes, I did business with you and not Earl. Why does the law look at it this 
way? Well, the title that you told me was for the van is in your name, not 
Earls. I paid you money, not Earl.

Bottom line is, it is your responsibility to correct the wrong. I take this 
past reply from you as an answer of NO, you will not help or supply me with 
some simple answers. I seriously think you are trying to hide something from 
me. All I ask was the name of the junkyard and where its location is. Since 
you will not tell me, I can only assume the worst.

I will inform you that all the notes I have sent you and your replies were 
kept. They will now be turned over to the DMV to show I have tried to take 
care of this problem on a man to man basis. I will let them decide to take 
legal action against you and maybe any possible future dealings you have 
with them.

Again, I am sorry you did not answere the simple questions I asked. All of 
this could have been avoided.

As far as the untiled buggy goes, this was discussed with Earl before we 
both came to the aggrement we would make a deal. I told him I never got a 
title for it from the previous owner.  I on the other hand was not informed 
that the VIN number on the van was in question and never was confirmed. I 
have been upfront with every thing I said or stated that I didnt know. If 
you say I didnt even talk to you about this matter, you are correct, but I 
didnt know that Earl was sending you the notes I had sent to him. You knew 
my email address and could have emailed me at any time.

David

****one of my final emails to Earl...and about the corners i NEVER got****

Earl,

Ok, and let me know about the corners for the van.

I asked Colin another simple question and got a reply from him that said he 
didnt want to talk to me anymore. All I asked him was the name of the 
junkyard and where its located. He kinda told me off and that he didnt want 
to communicate with me anymore. I have taken this as he has something to 
hide. I'm sorry he has done this because it has forced me to continue with 
my communication with the NC DMV. I thought that if I could get in contact 
with this junkyard, I could get them to take care of the title. Colin has 
now forced me to let the DMV take care of it.
I also explained to him that even though you and I had the trade, his name 
is on the title and so is his signature. This makes him totally responsible 
for the problem. I trusted him because I knew nothing about vans and I 
thought he did. I guess I was wrong and have learned another lesson about 
trusting people about cars.

David


&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;   So if you have made it this far, you know can judge for yourself how 
is the liar in this deal. You can see who has done the slandering stuff. I 
tried and tried to get this straight. This all started back in Feb of 1999. 
Several months of emails (and I have them too) back and forth from the NC 
DMV came up empty.

I wish I could ask that noone ever do dealings or business with Earl or 
Colin ever again, but thats your business.

I do ask the Admin of this list to consider removing them from the list and 
I do appoligize to the list and Steve for the use of the list like this.

Any questions on the info above will be ansered with more proof of the 
communication I had with Colin Simmons, Earl Newell and that of the State of 
NC DMV.

David...NOT a F_at_#KING LOSER, liar or one that does slander.

THis note will also be sent to the State of NC DMV. I just need to change 
the title since its not very nice.
