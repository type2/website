Subject: Re: [VB] Front beam Question

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;Hookman47_at_aol_dot_com&gt; 04/08/04 01:17PM &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Hello all,
&gt;A while back I had asked about the best way to lower the front of my
&gt;66 S/C and someone had suggested going with the ball joint front
&gt;end. Well I am going to have a front beam from a 74 bus narrowed
&gt;and modified with adjusters to bolt on to the 66. My question is this;
&gt;Since the new beam has disk brakes how much trouble am I looking at
&gt;to keep the power assist. I have already noted that the brake booster
&gt;and master cyl. mount to the beam where on the 66 it is in the front.
&gt;Has anybody done this before and how much of a mess am I going to
&gt;be getting myself into?
&gt;

Bob,

I think a 74 will not fit.  You should be looking for a 68-70 beam.

I have a 66 d/c and a 75 beam won't fit, and I was told 71-7?
(beyond 75) all had the same geometry.  A 68-70 beam will bolt
right up, and then you can ditch the front drums for discs.

If you want to keep the wide-5 pattern, you'll need to get
adapters (yuck!) or get one of the aftermarket systems that
has a wide 5 pattern in disc brak format for a ball joint front end.
