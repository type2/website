Subject: middle seat kick panel to trade

I have one of the really nice re-pop ones that were made a few years ago
still hanging around. It is only the aluminum trim and hardboard. There
is no material on it yet. I bought it to use on my samba but found a
perfect OG one a week after buying it. 

I will trade it for SO-34 parts or general accessory parts if anyone is
interested? Just let me know what you have.
