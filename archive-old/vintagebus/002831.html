&gt;I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine. Although it
&gt;seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable when cold due
&gt;to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each gear.  I was
&gt;told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a new 009
&gt;distributor.


This dizzy/carb combo is legendary for this. Best is to lose the 009 and get
a real dizzy. One with a vacuum advance. Alternately you can adjust the carb
to the point that you will get lousy fuel economy and it will run nearly
okay. Adjust up the accelerator pump to squirt more gas, and some recommend
riveting the hole in the throttle butterfly. Should get your gas mileage
down in the 12-14 range, that's how you know when you're getting all that
power that 009's give you. 8^)
