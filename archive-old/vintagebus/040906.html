Subject: Question on crank start handles??

I have a '56 bus, which came with a crank start handle. The handle is
different from others I have seen. The end of the handle that engages the
crank start nut has a smaller diameter shaft about 1 1/4 inches long beyond
the crosspiece. It appears that this extension might be spring loaded, i.e.
slides back into the main crank handle. If this is so, it's frozen. Note:
the handle appears to be hollow.

Another idea is that the extension fits a pilot hole in the crank start nut
however there's no such hole in the nut I have. What it boils down to is the
handle won't engage the crank start nut because of this 1 1/4 inch
extension. Do I have the wrong handle or is something else wrong?
