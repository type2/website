Subject: RE: [VB] guages - many questions

Hi Curt,
trying to get the finishing touches done on my new trike while the weather is
good so it can be inspected and registered.

The drivers side head above and slightly to the rear of #4 had a cast in boss
for the temp sensor on the following heads:
043 101 375H  75-79  T-1
311 101 375A  68 only carbureted
311 101 375C  69-70  T-3  (only some of the heads for USA)
311 101 375D  71 on

One of the heads, I can't remember which, had the sensor boss located on the
bottom side of #4 for who knows what reason. Then one or two of the letter
designations also have the hot air tube in the head for the hot air sensor for
the FI engines.

If you are looking for a sensor head, those are the factory choices, and they
are probably going to be found in rebuilt only. If you want a pic of them I
have a scan out of the Wilson book.

Where is the threaded sesnor hole on the factory heads?  I just bought
new stock Brazilian head from my local FLAPS for my son's '65 engine
rebuild (1600 DP), and I have .044 heads on my 1835.  Will this hole be
there?  On the # 3 cyl head?
