Subject: Complete OG  paint 63-15 window found in a Pick &amp; Pull

Was taking a power nap on Sat. when former listee Mike Anderson knocked on
my door.  He had been in a Pick &amp; Pull looking for minivan door gaskets for
his SO-34 resto.  Said there was a complete, original paint 15 window
hardtop deluxe walkthru among the minivans! Everything there including
complete engine that turned, all 5 wheels, interior, except for the
proverbial middle seat &amp; floor mat.  What to do, what to do?  Mike had
helped himself to 1 curved glass window, all the jail bars, rear bumper,
some door pulls, the radio &amp; speaker bracket, etc. but everything else was
still there.  I went w/ a buddy to look at it, &amp; we decided it definitley
needed to be saved.  The bus is very straight, w/ major rocker, 1 dog leg,
rear wheel well rust issues, &amp; entire roof w/ surface rust.  We offered to
buy the whole thing from the place, but they didn't want to sell whole as
there is no title.  We said &quot;no Problem&quot; to title issue &amp; hope to still save
it. Stay tuned.

Tom Buese-thank god my buddy has room for more projects in his driveway-I
don't
