Hall of Shame or Rare Bus? It's beyond me.

My sister In-law described an old family photo that
she saw at a local antique store for cheap. She
described the photo as an elongated old bus with a
canoe on top of it. Eventually I ended up with the
photo and have sent it to Thom Fitzpatrick for
placement on his website.
Looks like a potential Dormobile top, rack and long
canoe on top of a later era baywindow &lt;see taillights
and turnsignals&gt;.
The only description that was written on the back was
&quot;1976&quot;. No mention of location or other details.
Looks like an under powered Kyle Tillman special. &lt;see
tailpipe in stock location&gt;
