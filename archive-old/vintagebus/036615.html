People do it all the time.
I don't believe they are STILL making pressed bumpers.
They dropped pressed bumpers in the early 70ies.
Even in brazil they are not easy to come by.

&lt;&lt; Isn't there ANYONE in the US that can get brazil stuff. Seems like 
those pressed bumpers would be a big seller. Not to mention the ball 
joint front end, ect.
