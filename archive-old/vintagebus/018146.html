Junk.  I had one - actually 3; I kept taking them back and getting
a new one under warranty when it blew up.   

You won't have enuf real ooomph for air tools, and blasting is even
more iffy.  It might work for one of those baby sandblasters which
suck the sand out of a pail, but that's about it.  I have a 5hp 80gal,
and it barely keeps up with my blaster.  I eventually want to upgrade
to a 4-cylinder, but that's 10-times what you're looking at.

I bought my compressor used for $200 in 1996; check your local classified
rags and see what you can find.

&gt; 4H.P. 11 Gallon oil free compressor for $180.00
&gt; 
&gt; a) good price?
&gt; b) enough for basic things? (air-tools and bit of painting?) no
&gt; sandblasting.
