Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum case update deluxe LONG

Craig,

I'm no expert with only 2 or 3 rebuilds under my belt, but this happened
to me.  After a build up I broke in the motor only to be confronted with
what sounded like very loud valve train clunking much like you described
in your post.  I must have adjusted the valves 10 times but always the
clunking would return. 

In my quest to find the noise I removed the rocker assembly one more
time and curiously notice a slight wiggle in one of the shaft studs.  It
was starting to pull out and was only noticeably noisy when the motor
was running.  The sound I was hearing was the sound of the assembly
(rocker) slapping against the head boss.  I epoxyed the threads of the
offending stud and the problem was fixed.

Just a thought.

Steve
