&gt;&gt;This is a swivel bucket seat for split bus.  I've never seen or heard of such a thing before.  Is it gennie OEM?

Here's what I know:
It's a real thing.  Usually for Panels (99%), it was installed on walkthroughs that had a cut-down walkthrough portion.  There was no passenger seat so the Bus was a 1-seater.

It's up to $666 or so?  That is insane, a buddy of mine had one unupholstered for about $150 a year ago, it was tough to sell.  I wonder if he still has it...
