&lt;&lt; Anyone have any tips for getting a broken tap out of a front door screw 
hole? &gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
If you were using a high quality HSS (High Speed Steel.) tap the best thing 
is to use a hammer and punch to shatter what is left of the tap in the hole 
and then use a nail with a magnet attached to it to attract the steel pieces 
out.  Remember when using taps to oil.  Plus for every one turn in make sure 
to half turn out.  This keeps the chips of metal the tap is cutting in small 
pieces and less likely to bind up the tap which cause you these problems.
