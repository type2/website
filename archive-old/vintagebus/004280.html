Were all 6v wiper motors one speed? Or were 66 6v motors 2 speed?

Switch # 211 955 517 is a three position switch, off-low-high. It fits from
chassis # 216000001. This would be all 66 and 67 buses.

Motor # 211 955 111Q is a 6v from chassis 216000001 to 216190000.  All
66's....

Motor # 211 955 113D is a 12v from chassis 2160000001 to 216190000. All
66's.....

Therefore the 111Q motor is 2 speed since all 66's and 67's use the same
switch????

Motor # 211 955 113Q is 12v for all 67's from 217000001.

[66 12v is 111Q and 67 12v is 113Q]
