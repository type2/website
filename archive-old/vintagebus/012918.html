&gt;  Commercial - 1963 23 window deluxe, totaly
&gt; restored,
&gt; traded in for New Beetle
&gt; &gt;&lt;big snipola&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hmmm, I wonder what the trade-in value was?

 What I cant figure out is why anyone would do such a
thing!!! Do you realize those things have stuff in em
like this thing called Power steerin, cruze control, &amp;
air conditioner:) I just couldnt get used to a light
coming on everytime a door was opened.
 The guy who owns the business is prolly a Bus freak &amp;
this is his way to up his stash.
 &quot;With that little dent in it, we cant give you much
on a trade-in. But since it does runs, Ill give
$400....&quot;
