 I own a 67 DLX with a 1600 DP. On a “full flow” oil cooling system where the
 oil runs into a secondary cooler and an external oil filter, and then
 supplemented with an electric cooling fan, do you need to change or modify
 the Oil pressure relief valve when installing a system like this?
 
 Some “cooling kits” come with a new pressure relief valve to install with
 the above referenced cooling setup. Is this necessary? The list's vast
 knowledge would be helpful.

you may well want to install a thermostatic switch in the lines that means 
the oil will only go to the extra cooler once it has reached 180F
