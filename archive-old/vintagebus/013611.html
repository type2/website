Best wishes and encouragement to the Chirco/Tucson
show. The following comments in no way are pointed at
the nice people who promote shows or are parts vendors
who make our hobby possible.

Various shows happen throughout the year. I wonder why
the magazines cover some small if not teeny shows and
annually ignore other &lt;sizable&gt; shows. On a related
thread I have a question that probably doesn't need
answered.

Question:
Speaking as only an individual, I wonder why in the
HELL do the VW magazines fail to cover the Arizona Bus
Club Jerome Jamboree event? The magazines include the
ABC event in thier mag's Upcoming Events section(s)
several months in advance. After several emails,
letters and personal phone calls to the editors both
mags have continuously punked out and failed to
attend. Various club members have submitted copy and
photos which were included in a one column blurb. One
of the answers that was offered was that &quot;they don't
cover small events.&quot; Pfffft! BullS**t! Some of the
events covered tend to look like they were only
attended by two rusty Vanagons and a three legged dog.
Another answer was that they &quot;don't camp&quot; and that
hotel expenses etc. would need to be provided. Pffft!
what do they do when covering off-road events? Stay
awake and stand by their New Beetle all day? At
Jerome, EVERYONE camps and contributes to the
charitiable cause(s) of that year.

I personally wish the mags well and am saying that
they are only missing a good time. It's too bad that
the subscibers are limited to the &quot;sano&quot; vehicle of
the month. And thanks for getting the first issue of
my Christmas present subscription to me by June.
