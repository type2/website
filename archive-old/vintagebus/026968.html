&gt; Minor stuff.  I recommend you invest in a 150 Mig welder.

Good advice, but it's not even that bad.  There's no rust-through except
the battery tray, and it's all been repaired pretty well.  Cars don't
rust in AZ (or So. Cal. much, bus was a surfer in OB for a while,
according to the stickers :-)
 
&gt; &gt; This bus has been to costa rica and back, and is a totally custom
&gt; &gt; camper (was a standard).
&gt; 
&gt; *That's* cool.
 
Full-length stock welded steel roof rack.  (Quite the find, in and
of itself!)  Two tone white upper, teal lower.  Was dove blue.

Front seats are from a Toyota Celica.  No rear seats, just a plywood bed
(very nicely done, has cabinets, decent panels, etc.)  Somebody cut
an access panel for overhead engine access (like a t3), brutal but
nicely done.  The reason is that it has an oversized oil cooler and an
external filter.  vdo cht and tach, vdo voltmeter (12v).  Has a driver
side visor from a T-model ford.  Has the churchkey for engine and gas
door.  It's been retrofitted with a late exhaust including (i think ss)
manifold, empi muffler, and late model heaterboxes (ugh, but they'll
hardly be needed out here.)   I'm fairly sure that I need to learn
about linkpin frontends, it'll need new bushings for sure.  I believe
the front seal leaks, that means, new front seal, maybe clutch, TO, and
I'll check out the flywheel and bench test the starter then.  Need to
do brake hoses and fuel lines of course.  That's about all I know so far.

1641, stock lifters, dual Dellortos (!), runs great, looks beautiful.
two other people were there looking, I was there first (Auto trader ad
ran today, internet ads started yesterday).

The (last 2) PO's never worked on it themselves, and the current PO
always took it to a shop in Flagstaff.  That's who did all the custom
powerplant stuff, including the 12v conversion, the rebuild on the 1600,
the dellortos...  And the receipts are meticulously organized along with
the placards from the various rallys and shows it's been in.  One of the
forward panels is covered with magnets from years and years of vw shows.
Seems quite rough, hardly a &quot;show bus&quot;, but somebody was sure giving
it hell.

Get this:  It still has the belly pan over the steering box and mc.  
I've *never* seen that on a bus, and only once on a bug.  It has the
original floor mats (fairly rotted, but clean).  No bad rust on the 
cargo floor. 

Needless to say, I asserted that I was there first, and we drove to
the bank in the bus...

I might be looking for pre-64 rear seats, but the bed is kinda cool.
Better than a westy z-bed definitely.  Might just get a futon mattress
and some big pillows and beanbags :-)
