Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

Ya, not too bad to disassemble it... shows how in my later  Bentley (one for 
68-71 buses or was it 69 on bugs)  I have taken them apart, cleaned things up, 
replaced bad bearings, smoothed out wavy commutators, and made them work.  
takes some time, but kind of neat.   

I just used good bearings from a nother gen.. don't know where to buy them... 
try a bearing house?

with engine off and fan belt disconnected, see if the gen wiggles at the 
front or rear (has a bearing either end). Spin it and see it it is smooth.

 start engine up to see if the whine went away with the fan belt 
disconnected.   ( It's okay to just start it up for a minute).  If the noise if gone, it 
probably came from the gen.  Turn engine off.  Reattach belt and start it up 
again.  Is the noise back?

I think I'm needing new bearings for my 12v generator. Does anyone sell
them? It's the standard common 12Volt unit. It sounds like they are
starting to whine.

Can the generator be disassembled fairly easily and can the bearings be
replaced? I'd rather not have to buy a whole new genny just cause the
bearings are failing.
