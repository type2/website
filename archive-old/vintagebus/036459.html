Subject: Re:  [VB] NOS deluxe grab handle
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

If it is the kind with the triangular shaped  tube and chrome ends (my 
mothboard still is out- no website surfing for me) it is for  a 61 deluxe.  
These are fairly rare, but then again not that many buses used them.   62-67 
used the later oval/flat grey (yelows)cross-section handle, 62-64 have black 
ends, 65-67 grey (white) ends,  this is of course  much commoner style of 
grab handle and is the style which is reproed. 3/55 through 61 dashgrab 
handles were not standard,61 they were standard equip for deluxes only.    
FWIW the 61 middle seat is one year onely because of the grab bar on the back 
of it.    I have a full length 62-&gt; middle seat with the grey upholstery that 
came in the SWR/BG buses that I would like to trade for a 61 seat.   I only 
knoe this cuz I have a 61 deluxe, and though it is ratty, dented and rusty, 
it has the correct parts on it, dammit.  Well    whatever,    wow, over $100? 
  some pricey.  Maybe I 'll sell my spare on ebay.
.....................
There's an NOS deluxe dash grab handle on ebay. It's
the beige-grey one but it has chrome ends. Was these
the stock issue ends on deluxes with the plastic grab
handle?

I haven't seen ones with the chrome ends. Maybe I
haven't seen enough deluxes. But the repro shops only
have beige-grey ends. Has anyone seen a repro with the
chrome ends?

BTW: The bidding is at $102.50. I think someone is
building another $45,000 deluxe.

67 deluxe soon to be ex-&quot;DARTHVW&quot; (no grab handle)
