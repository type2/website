&gt;Is there an easy way to do this cause I was under the bus and theres
&gt;no way to get both hands under there and turn a wrench! Or is there....
&gt;Seems theres two nuts ones a 11 or so and the other is a 14 or so....

I just did this in my bowden tube adventure.  I was using one of those
flat ratcheting wrenches, but a regular ratchet with appropriately deep
socket will probably work too.  I found that I could put the wrench on
the nut, wrench pointing down, and swing the bottom end of the wrench
out towards the drivers side for one click of the ratchet, then pull
it back down and do it again.

The main thing that helped me is that I don't have the flexible
connecting pipe between the heater box outlet and the body tube
installed.  I was laying with my feet out the back of the Bus,
putting my right arm outboard of the heater box and reaching over
the heater box outlet to turn the wrench, and sticking my left
arm up through the spot where the heater flex pipe was to help
hold the cable and reposition the wrench.

There is part of the cable end piece that isn't threaded and it may 
help to hold this with pliers or locking pliers to keep the cable
from twisting.  If the cable end is goopy it may help to hose down
the threads with WD-40 or similar spray solvent.  If all you have
are plain wrenches, remember that the end is usually offset so you
can turn the nut, flip the wrench over, and turn it a little more.

Before this I had only ever adjusted the clutch on my Dad's '74 Bug
with the big wing nut.  That is approximately 31.415 times easier
than the two nut deal.

I hope this helps!
