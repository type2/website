&gt;He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
&gt;before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
&gt;think that this is a good idea, please let me know.


I do.

&gt;&gt;Here's a thought to help increase the list's funds.  If you decline I
&gt;understand why, but I thought I'd offer...
&gt;
&gt;It would be very easy for me to add a part number TYPE2DONATE to the Bus
&gt;Depot website, for a value of $5 or $10 (although a quantity of more than 1
&gt;could be selected if the person wanted to donate more). This would allow
&gt;anyone who bought something at the Depot to at the same time donate to the
&gt;list (or perhaps choose to take the money he saved with his listmember
&gt;discount and apply it as a donation to the list).  This isn't intended to
That seems hard to work:


&gt;replace your Paypal account, which is for people who are specifically
&gt;donating to the list, but rather to augment it with &quot;impulse donations&quot; 
&gt;from
&gt;people who are buying parts. Kind of the e-commerce equivalent of the can 
&gt;at
&gt;the cash register where you put your spare change to support the SPCA or
&gt;whatever.
&gt;
&gt;When we send out our accounts-payable checks about once a month, I could 
&gt;cut
&gt;you a check for the total of the amount received.  (It would be easy to
&gt;track; all I'd have to do is run a report of sales of part number
&gt;TYPE2DONATE, then multiply the &quot;quantity sold&quot; by the &quot;value&quot; that we chose
&gt;each &quot;unit&quot; to be, $5 or $10.)  For my part of the donation, I'd absorb the
&gt;2% credit card processing fee, so you'd get the full value of the donation
&gt;without credit card/paypal costs.
&gt;
&gt;My thought is that many people would donate that way if it were as easy as
&gt;clicking a button while they are already making a purchase anyway.  It 
&gt;would
&gt;increase the donations significantly if each listmember who ordered a part
&gt;for their bus threw in even just $5 toward the list each time they ordered.
&gt;\


I would donate my type 2 list discount up to $10 dollars for every order. I 
see a problem here however, and maybe you saw it too. In this way you are 
being supported by an advertiser. This does seem to be a conflict of 
interest. This would have to be monitored closely, but with todays reality 
of the internet becomming a $ market, and those with bandwidth severly hit, 
this seems like a workable possibility.
First: Its optional. I could save the money and blow off supporting the 
list.
Second: Ronnie is not sending ad banners, or activly engaging in increasing 
his sales with the exception of posting rare parts he aquires. He must hold 
to this and recieve no special compensation for hit efforts.

Third: Other rare part venders or persons who find clients through the list 
without activly marketing us could participate in a simular program.

I would have donated my savings to the list, and maybe still will.
