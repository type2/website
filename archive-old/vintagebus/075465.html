&gt;Checked 5 terminal strip, and found that indeed the wire entering it
&gt;from switch and exiting to driver's bulb has no current.  All others
&gt;work fine.  So now I assume my troubles are in the switch, correct?

That sounds reasonable to me.  For a final check, at that 5 terminal
strip, disconnect the driver's rear wire coming from the switch.  Take
out the passenger rear bulb.  Now run a jumper wire from any hot terminal
at the fuse box to the terminal at the strip that goes to the driver's
rear bulb.  If this makes that bulb come on brightly, then yes, your
problem is most likely in the switch.  What you're doing is proving
that the wiring to the driver's rear works (jumper wire) and that it
doesn't have a bad ground (taking out the other bulb).

&gt;If so, what can I do once I take the switch apart to try and
&gt;remedy this, and what should I leave alone?

You might see if it's simply a broken solder connection or metal strip
and if so, attempt to resolder it.  Sometimes using a bigger iron will
work better than a smaller one, as it allows you to get &quot;in and out&quot;
without heating up the plastic or phenolic parts inside the switch too
much.  If a contact is burned and pitted, you may be able to dress it
with a fine file to restore its operation.  You might also try cleaning
the contacts with some &quot;tuner cleaner&quot; (NOT WD-40) from Radio Shack
and/or lubricating the mechanism with dielectric grease.

&gt;In a pinch, Can  I swap the switch over from the '65 that is working
&gt;fine?

I think they are different, but check the '67 parts manual at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ to be sure.
