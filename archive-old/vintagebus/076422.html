Subject: Re: [VB] Early bay front emblem?

----- Original Message -----
&gt; didn't someone glue razor blades under the edge of his emblem?  and come
back
&gt; one day to find blood there where some idjit had attempted to steal the
&gt; emblem?   or is that an urban myth?

LOL, that reminds me of an idiot that worked for me about 6-7 years ago. A
bang-ganger type of kid, talking tough and was telling us how he was going
to get some rims later that night. &quot;Yea, whatever Chris&quot; is all we said,
since we thought he was full of it.

Next day he came in with his hands wrapped up looking like big giant Q-tips.
Apparently when he reached around the tire (wow, he actually did try to
steal some rims), something cut his fingers. They cut right through most of
the tendons in his fingers and he was out of work for about 8 months while
they healed. Had to have his mom and girlfriend do everything for him during
that time, since he no longer had hands to use. I have no idea if it was
just a sharp casting flaw on the rims, or if the owner of the rims had put
something back there just for this reason.

We laughed at him so hard when he walked in and told the story to us. We
would have had sympathy for him if it happened any other way, but due to the
circumstances, we couldn't feel a lot of pitty for him. I don't think he
liked the reaction we gave him.

P.S. Yes, he was busted later the next day thanks to the blood he left all
over the ground by the car, and the cops checking with local hospitals for
people with hand injuries.
