&lt;&lt;  on the '60, i have the pull knob for hte reserve fuel..... no cable, no
bits to do anything with yet... but i also have a gauge -- did buses
sometimes have both, i'd have thought one or the other... spose it must be a
change over year.&gt;&gt;
Hi Glynn,
Well the fuel gauge came in 1962 and the fuel reserve was last seen in the
1961 buses if our memories serve us right.  You could have had a fuel gauge
installed at the dealership in buses from chassi # 20-117 902 on up to when
the fuel gauge became standard in the bus.  VW Techincal Bullitian K 6 shows
how to do this installation.

&lt;&lt; but no go with the gauge...   so, i've looked at the top of the sender and
theres only one wire - fitted to the terminal on centre of sender and running
to the gauge. from memory - i think there was another wire on my old bus? -
and looking at the wiring diagram in the book - it shows an earth.  but top
of sender hasn't got another terminal - so i don't want to rely on my memory,
attatch a wire to the side of sender and kabooom :(&gt;&gt;
            Yes, the Technical Bulletain shows the you have to have a ground
wire connected to one of the senders mounting bolts and then the other end
screwed to the bus body firewall forward of the tank.  In the standard fule
senders of later buses this grond wire connected to the rear of the tank
instead.   Eric&amp;Barb
