Subject: Re: [VB] 6v gas gauge, 12v car.

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I've seen a couple posts now regarding this.  I run a 6v gauge in my 12v
&gt;car with no voltage drop at all.  The gauge works fine, it says full
&gt;when it's full. and empty when it's empty.  It does bounce around a lot
&gt;when it's about 1/2 full, but I attribute this to my sender unit.  I've
&gt;been led to believe that since the gauge only measures resistance it
&gt;doesn't matter what voltage it's using.  I'm no expert so don't flame
&gt;me, but I've been using this setup now for 3 years now with no probs.


I don't want to seem argumentative; if your setup works for you that's
great, BUT...

If it doesn't matter if we use 6v or 12v with a Bus gas guage, then why are
the guages stamped on the back with '6v' or '12v'?

I'm very interested in this issue because my '66 has been converted to 12v,
and the gas guage is VERY inaccurate.
