Hey Dave,

My 66 dlx came w/ a bay window sifter.  The ball &amp; stick on the end that 
goes to the shift linkage is the same and they work fine, only dif is 
different threads on the top resulting in a bigger knob.  I didn't even 
change mine till I scored a splittie extension.

Eric
66dlx w/ interchangable shifting capabilities


&gt;
&gt;Are the shifters in Bay Windows the same has Splits?
&gt;
