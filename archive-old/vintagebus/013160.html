Subject: I Need Child's Cot Hanging Brackets!

I purchased a child's cot to hang over the front seat of our &quot;72 bus. The
brackets and screws that go with the cot never materialized. I need to get
these parts to complete the family camper setup. The cot is supposedly from
an early bay westy. The poles are round and have a little tab on the end
that should fit into the bracket. 

I also would like to have the correct screws.  If any knows the correct
screw size then I guess I can sub that item out. One last thing: should I up
a tap for the screws?
