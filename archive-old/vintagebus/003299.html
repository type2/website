So my brakes seemed strange,  I took off both rear wheels today and
everything seemed ok in there.  I played around with the pedal and I think
part of my problem is one of those springs - guess I have to replace the
horizontal one - no big deal.

The Big Deal
So I was adjusting my front brakes before I bled them and I looked in the
hole and thought I saw some grease - that ain't right - so I looked harder -
slide a screw driver in - Damn! I wanted to aviod taking the front drums
off - I replaced those bearing not that long ago. I couldn't get those
bearings out before without breaking them - Muir says pry em out with a
screw driver - yeah right! So I guess I'm gonna have to replace my from
break shoes if there is grease on them.
