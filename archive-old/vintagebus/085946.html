&gt; Also use a line wrench, which wraps around 4 sides of the hex.   When
you break the nut free, wiggle back and forth to make sure the nut spins
on the metal line, it can stick to the metal line and twist and break the line.

You should use two wrenches on the connections to the metal line, a &quot;brake
line wrench&quot; on the metal line side, and a box wrench on the hex or flats
on the rubber hose.  Use the two wrenches against each other rather than
putting stress on the metal lines.
