&gt; Everyone that does a lot of welding seems to recommend the Lincoln or

&gt; that's about it. After that the unit will likely sit. Do we really need
&gt; the high priced unit? I rarely drive a screw and when I do, my cheap
&gt; Black &amp; Decker unit does the job just fine. Can anybody recommend a
&gt; welder that won't bust the budget?

A low quality welder will not stand up during periods of long storage as
well as a well-made one.  After it sits for a year you might find that it
doesn't work when you need it.

Buy one well-made welder or two junk ones.  Same price.
