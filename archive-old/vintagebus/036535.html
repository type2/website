Message-ID: &lt;81h0r1$j62s_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

well i'm going to pick up my other 66 hartop deluxe this weekend
(previous post about that trip) so here's the scoop

i now have 2 1966 hardtop deluxes
1 parked since 1977 the other 1987
they are both titian red/beige white

both are almost completely rust free (both have cargo_at_bulkhead
rust, minor, and thats all) front floors, cargo doors etc. perfect.

both have original engines (not running) complete

no middle or rear seats in either

1's a walkthrough, 1's not

 headliner's perfect in 1, almost perfect in other

both are very complete buses (thanks to all those on the list
that came through on the parts for the church bus)

1 was used as a church bus it's whole life, this is the almost perfect
bus, body has 3 dents (minor) and complete trim etc.

the other (walkthrough) has been in restoration for years, body work
started, which isn't bad, except for the work on the nose, yips
will need to do it over.

so as you can see i don't need 2 deluxes, so the church bus (non
walkthrough) is going up for sale, i will respond to all on the list
that have allready inquired about it and see what happens there before
i go on the net with it, the price will be around 3 g's partial trades
will be excepted (parts or bus), this bus still has original paint
(faded) and is unmolested in any way, the perfect bus for that
perfect restoration.
