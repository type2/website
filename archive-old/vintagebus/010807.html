&gt;  I guess I should make provision for this. Pair of scissors jacks and a
&gt;  board? Does anybody have a more compact solution than that?
&gt;  I bet there's a lot of other stuff I am not thinking of. Please fill
&gt;  me in so I don't need to go bugging the AIRS types along the way. They
&gt;  will appreciate it, and so will I,

==============
bring a small rolling floor jack.  I heard the roads aren't so great, so 
bring a board as well, so you can create a flat area the jack does not sink 
into.
small folding shovel
at least two spare tires- did you read the inuvik story- they had lots of 
flat tires, and expect your windsheilds to get cracked from rocks kicked up.  
maybe 3 spares.  Hm, maybe a roof rack if you don't have one.
I use a flex handle bar and a 1/2&quot; 19mm *impact* socket as the lug bolt tool. 
 a 3/4&quot; socket fits 19mm.  with a short extension.  lives behind the drivers 
seat.

I personally bring the Persuader on any road trip- a 5 ft length of pipe, 
that has not yet failed to loosen or snap any VW nut/bolt I have used it on.  
Great for rear axle nuts, and FW nuts.  Double to help hang a shade tarp when 
camping.  Fits perfectly just in front of the Westy Z bed, across the width 
of the bus.
