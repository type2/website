I am new to this list and somewhat uneasy to ask questions from the members
of this list.I have many read  many flames against new people for asking
percieved
stupid questions. this may also be a stupid question.I am currently restoring
a
1966 westy that sat in the woods for a long long time.This bus was apparently
converted to 12 volt by some PO. I know this because the tranny had been
grinded
out and it had a 12 volt voltage regulator.

My question is  that today a problem developed.For the first 4 days that i got
it running I had  my headlights working but tonight when showing my lights to
a
friend suddenly my driver side headlight began  to smoke alot.Is this due to
the
addition of a 12 volt system.

I'm also can't get my turn signals, horn,and brake light to work. The  PO
drove it after converting to 12volt.But it Still has all  6 volt signal
relays, etc. I looked at many of
the articles on converting 6 volt to 12 volt systems, but they are vague in
reference
to making the lights work with a voltage change since the PO was unaviable to
tell me what he has done. please help me if you can. I know this is a stupid 
question and I may have missed some helpful articles from one of the web sites
or from the idiot book.Should I change all of the  6 volt stuff out or can I
use a voltage drop to make them work.

All the wires are hooked up according to the 66 wiring diagram and i could not
find any wrong connections or
faulty fuses.
Thank you for your patience.
Jim
66 westy
