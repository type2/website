&lt;&lt; Hello,
      Yesterday, the red light on my '67 bus came on and stays on.  The fan
 belt is good and tight, the headlights burn bright, and the bus starts just
 fine.  I have no idea what the problem is.  I imagine the voltage regulator
 is bad, but how is it still keeping the voltage regulated and the battery
 charged?  If anyone has any insight, please let me know.
 
 Thanks, &gt;&gt;
I never can get this red light/ green light bit.   mine all tend to be 
yellow.   so what is goinig on there?   first- check which light it is.   
turn the ignition on ( not the engine) and unplug the wire from  the sending 
unit- which dash light goes off?  is it the same one that stays on?  if so- 
thats your oil pressure light- if not- your generator light.

gen light-  just because your battery has enough juice to last another day 
doesn't mean the battery is charging.

 check the brushes-   and to see if there are any loose wires 

i tend to find that the light is not steady, it is bright either at high roms 
or at low rpms.   brighter at low rpoms means bad brushes, brighter at ligh 
rpms means bad regulator.  this is unscientific, just my experience.   have 
not yet found the way to test regulators without hooking them up to the 
charging system.

oh- of course, if you have a voltometer, check what the system is outputting.
