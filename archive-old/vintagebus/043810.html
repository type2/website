&gt;I run my 6v Semaphores with 12v bulbs, and run the semaphores them 
&gt;selves on 12v.  I have been doing this for almost a year with no
&gt;problems.

Write back in 30 years and let us know how it works out.  :)

&gt;I have a set of SWF (non VW) 12v semaphores, and the coils are 
&gt;identical size, so I don't think the actuation is a problem, 

Are the coils wired with the same (or d_at_mn close) gauge of magnet
wire and the same (or d_at_mn close) number of turns?  If not, there
probably were some design differences.

From what I understand, good used semaphores can go for $100 a pop.
The resistor will cost you $15 tops.  &quot;Pay me now or pay me later...&quot;  :)
