BTW, one tecnique I've developed for dealing with the leakage is
to drill tiny holes at the lower rear of the dash tray.  Sure,
it doens't stop the leakin, but it gets the water out of the dash
tray.

I was able to make the safaris in the '56 mostly leak-free by 
using adhesive weatherstripping on the inside of the window
itself, along the frame.  It made it a tad more diffiult to close,
and looked ugly, but it reduced the river to a spring...
