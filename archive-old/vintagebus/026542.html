Here's another variable for you whilst adjusting your valves....
This is how I've done mine for years with no problems. I call it the 3-1
method

Get engine to #1 TDC
Adjust #1 intake and exhaust , #2 intake (3 forward most on right side of
vehicle) then do #4 exhaust (rear most on left side)

Get engine to #3 TDC
Adjust #3 intake and exhaust, #4 intake (3 forward most on left side) then do
#2 exhaust (rear most on right side)

Much easier than turning the engine over and over bouncing from one side to
the other.

Just my .02
