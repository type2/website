&gt;I changed the oil in my 65 Splittie (once again, first time) and bought a
&gt;new oil screen with gaskets.  When I put the new gaskets and oil screen in
&gt;and tightened it down, and added the oil, it started leaking around the
&gt;seal..... Question: Are you suppose to get the the cardboard gasket wet
&gt;first ?  Put gasket sealant on it ?  Use a different type of gasket other
&gt;than cardboard ? I'm a idiot and I dont know what I'm doing ?  Don't answer
&gt;that !  Also what kind of oil do you guy's use in a 1600CC engine that has
&gt;about 4000 miles on it ?  My friend, who is more technically inclined than
&gt;me recommended Castrol GTX 10W/30, but he doesnt know anything about VW's.


Paper and cardboard gaskets need to be sealed before using. Hoover's
'sermons' had a good one about this. I use Indian Head Gasket Shellac, paint
it on the gasket and let it dry. I'm sure others can write in and explain
why you would never want to do this, or that you should use spit, or shoe
polish or whatever. For every chair made there is an ass to sit in it. As to
the oil, that's a good oil for Alaska right now, but it all depends on the
temperature conditions where you are driving. I am partial to single weight
oils, others like multi-grade, but if it is cooler weather where you are, as
a rule, you go a step lighter in the winter, heavier in the summer. Tell us
the temps you will encounter until the next oil change interval, someone can
help you out.
