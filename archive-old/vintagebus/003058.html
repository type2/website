Subject: WTB:  Misc. 66 bus parts
Date: Sun, 28 Jun 1998 18:40:47 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm slowly accumulating parts for my 66 bus.  I've been very patient and
have been lucky to find various items which will eventually find their way
into the 66 which I spent very little for.  Such items include:

Interior TMI panels in black vinyl: $40
Complete set of WCM Rubber:    $500
Moon hubcaps mint oem:           $35.75
Dual 34ICT's:                            ~$225
Solid T3 engine:                         $50
PCoated rims:                            $125
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've got quite a bit of money tied up in it so far and I haven't even
brought it into town yet to actually get started.  I'm looking for any misc.
parts that someone may be able to offer to me for the bus.  Like I tell
others, I never know what I'm looking for until I find it.  I know these are
long shots but here goes:

I need to find the following (in new, used, or definitely rebuildable
shape):

Adjustable front beam
Sheet metal for driver's floor under feet
Sheet metal for behind driver's seat on floor
Sheet metal for underneath cargo doors
Safari's
Set of rear drums from a VW thing with backing plates
Non-Weld kit to convert 66 bus to IRS (special axles, clamps, etc.)
Middle seat (would prefer 1/3 - 2/3 setup but beggars ain't choosers you
know)
Handful of 12v to 6v convertors (good beefy ones meant to last - I have a
notion to run convertors for the wiper motor, clock and radio and keep the
dropdowns in a bank which is cooled by a fan)

I know I'll probably end up buying a lot of this new but I just wanted to
put the word out.  Even if you don't personally have any of this, I'll take
any leads on this stuff.

Thanks!
