Subject: RE: [VB] Hoopty Doo?

and he is in the process of restoring the Binz and is blowing out whatever
trading cards he has left.

ronnie

He has also told me that if there was enough interest he would make more
hoops, the last time he made them everyone complained of the price, he can
still gear up to make them and I will contact him if there is enough
interest. The last set he had went to Joe Bair in Jersey for the side loader
I sold him, and the other 3 sets went to Everett, Jerry Jess and me. I sold
mine when I found a set of OG and you would have been hard pressed to tell
his from OG

&gt; ps. Derel Kreig (sp) sold his repo's (hoops) for 300 dollars, he has the
&gt; dies and would sell them if somebody wanted to buy them.

Derek Gregg is his name..................

He did the VW trading cards as well, and drove a Binz.
