Carl -

No I am not an Alaskan listee, but I will be driving my '63/'64
Sundial to Alaska and back this August / September. We're going all
the way to the Arctic Circle with the stock VW heating system, leaky
windows and a lot of warm clothes. Do you have any good advice for me
about running a splitty in the cold cold cold and other points
relevant to Alaska driving?

Leave the Northern Lights on for me,
Joel

Ps. What are gas prices like in Alaska? I'm trying to put together a
tentative budget to exceed on this trip.
