Subject: VW Factory Tools at Sac B-O-R (long)

So I see this guy walking around in the swaps with a
couple VW factory tools in his hand, and being a freak
for such tools, I asked where he got them and if there
were more. Much to my surprise he says a guy has a
&quot;whole big pile&quot; of tools, right down the row. Yeah,
right, heard that before. So he gives me vague swap
meet type directions, and after about 10 minutes of
searching frantically, I don't see the guy. Then about
10 minutes after that, my radio/pager thing goes off
and it's Lind asking if I'd been to the guy with all
the tools? WTF, where is this guy? As I turn the
corner around the front of a truck, there is a huge
pile of tools. Definitely the largest pile of tools
I've ever seen at a show. The guy works at a
dealership and he said that VW had released these
tools from the requirement list that dealerships must
have on hand, so they needed to be sold off. 
Anyway, I ask how much tools are, and to my utter
amazement, he says &quot;the stuff on the tarp ranges from
$2 to $5.&quot; Holy Crap!!! There were all kinds of early
air cooled stuff that I recognized immediately, and
after I had a big handful of tools, I asked a price,
and he asked if I was interested in more, and of
course I said yes, so he said &quot;make a pile&quot;. Ah, the
words I LOVE to hear. Basiclly, anything I recognized
went on the pile. I was grabbing tools in a frenzy,
and the pile grew rapidly. There were a few splitcase
tranny tools in their original wooden boxes, so I
asked how much they were, to be answered by $10. On
the pile. 
So I make this gigantic pile, which also included an
NOS VW in the box small hatch bus interior rear view
mirror, and a bunch of new tune pu parts, and the pile
came out to $110. So Rachel and I load up a few
containers with tools and start carrying them. HEAVY.
I saw a guy who had an empty wheel barrel next to his
truck, borrowed that, and it made the rest of the way
much easier. Went back another time to buy more,
filled another box with tools, $25. 
Went back at the end of the day, and bought everything
else VW for $50. Thanks again to that guy who let me
use his wheel barrel---twice. 
What a great tool score. Lots of things I can use, and
a couple other things I already have that I hope to
sell off or trade for other tools. 
But the things I wonder most about all this tool pile
are: 
-Why didn't Lind and Greg, who were there before me,
buy more stuff? Plenty of good stuff was left when I
got there. 
-I'd also be interested in hearing from anyone else
who bought tools there to see ehat else was there
before I got there, because I was definitely late to
this pile. 
-Does anyone know who the guy was, and how I can
contact him? I forgot to get his info in all this
excitment.
