&lt;&lt; I would like to ask for your advice again concerning my bus.  It's a 1965 
21 window.  The engine is I believe a early 70's 1600 dual port engine ( it 
has both the oil pressure relief valve and the control valve).  I believe I 
need to replace my oil pump.  The oil pressure light comes on (after I've 
driven awhile) when I stop and the engine is idling.  I've inspected just 
about everything but the oil pump.&gt;&gt;

Hi Tim,
Okay, we have had the same problem several times in our engines, and a 
friend's bus while we were caravanning through the Syskious Mountains in N. 
Calif. at the same time as our bus was having low oil pressure problems.  
Though these times were with single relief valve engine cases which have 
smaller oil passages, and less oil pressure control.  We finally figured out 
through trial, and error that to reduce the RPMs kept our oil pressure up, 
and oil temp down.  
  There are other problems that could be causing this low oil pressure 
problem of yours, or at least the previous problem it more pronounced.  
1.  Sticking relief, and control valve.
2.  Worn out, or damaged oil pump, or upper drive gear loose on it's drive 
shaft.
3.  Badly mated to engine oil pump.
4.  Loose oil pick up tube.
5.  Too small of lower pulley, or too thin of cooling fan.
6.  Clogged oil cooler, and/or passages to cooler.
7.  Worn out tappet bores.
8.  Worn out cam, crank, and rod bearings.
So we would first suggest check the relief, and control valve to make sure 
they are not sticking first.  Would be very helpfull if you got some gauges.  
Especially oil pressure, and oil temp in that order.
 
&lt;&lt;I've never replaced an oil pump before (I'm a real novice when it comes to 
engine repair----although I am slowly learning more).
  Here are my questions: 
 1.  How difficult is it to replace the oil pump.  What words of advice or &quot; 
pearls of wisdom&quot;  might you have for me?  In particular any &quot; do's or 
don'ts&quot;!&gt;&gt;
Remove the rear apron, rear engine breast plate.  Remove the lower pulley 
which will probably require a puller for that, and once off you should hand 
sand the pulley so you can get it off, and on by hand instead.  Then remove 
the engine tin that mounts just in front of the lower pulley, and take off 
the oil pump cover.  Do not pry with a screw driver between the pump, and the 
area that the engine case seals to the oil pump exterior flange.  Get the 
special oil pump puller.  Either while you just have the oil pump cover off, 
or the whole thing removed from the engine it would be wise to check the oil 
pump for wear, tear, or wrong size for your engine.  For if is in good shape, 
and proper size, type for your engine case you have other problems to deal 
with!
 
&lt;&lt;2.  Looking at Rocky Mt Motorworks catalog, I'm not sure which type of oil 
pump I should use.  (The prior owner of my bus had put on a oil sump for 
extra oil capacity)  I would think the heavy duty oil pump might be better 
than the standard given the oil sump I have on my bus? The oil pump choices 
include:  Standard or heavy duty. four bolt dished cam or a three bolt flat 
cam.  They even indicate that some of the oil pumps are for a &quot; small oil 
hole&quot;  or a &quot; large oil hole&quot;.
 
 3.  How do I determine if I need a 4 bolt dished cam oil pump or a 3 bolt
 flat cam?  How do I determine if I have a small oil hole or a large oil
 hole?&gt;&gt;
Okay,since you have a dual relief case you should have a large oil hole 
system.  With the oil pump apart you can take the upper oil pump gear to your 
local shop, and have them tell you which cam you have by comparing your gear 
to others.  If not, then you will just have to remove the oil pump body to 
get a look at the rear end of the cam.
