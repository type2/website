Subject: Complete Tranny Swap, Help.

Please, if anyone has the post with the complete description I would be very
grateful if you would p-mail it to me.
I deleted mine in error and I will be undertaking that project in the next
couple of weeks.
I'll be taking the center section tranny out of a '72 super beetle and
swapping it into my '66 bus.
I can't believe I lost those messages....
I'd sure appreciate the help.
thanks
John Flowers
