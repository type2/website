Subject: Re: [VB] OT - Thing hard luck story

Follow Thoms advice ! I did this early this year( different car) Insurance
told me it was worth almost nothing, theirs CO. and mine CSAA, the receipts
1&quot; thick made all the difference or was it when I called back a few days
later and told them my neck hurt ? I thought I was going to court over that
one but they send me a check so a good ending. Hope yours works out too .

&gt;&quot;2yrs on a full resto on the car, over 8k in receipts,&quot;
&gt;
&gt;???  $8K!!!  Without paint!   Come on now.  There are not that many parts
to
&gt;a Thing.
&gt;
&gt;Seems excessive $ for a roller.
&gt;
&gt;As for the real question I like Thom's advice.
