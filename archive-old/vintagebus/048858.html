Subject: a little more info on generator light

light does  seem to fade very slightly at high RPM's...not much though.

I disconnected the wires going to the regulator and then connected a 
voltmeter to the generator. Positive to D+, negative grounded to the 
generator...as well as grounding DF to the generator. Started the 
engine and did a real quick test. It showed a full 12-13 volt output. 
I quickly shut off the engine. So hopefully I tested correctly and 
generator is hopefully OK.

I connected the regulator back up and started the engine. I couldn't 
get very much charge from the output of the regulator. So it looks 
like it MAY be the bad guy. Doesn't make sense though. Engine has 
just been sitting...and this is one of those funky solid state Bosch 
flat looking regulators. It's all sealed up so nothing could be in 
there. Even after cleaning the contacts it shows the same low output.

This is also brand new Bosch unit. Got it with the brand new Bosch 
generator and only has 3000 miles on it.

Looks like it might just be yet another piece of junk that I've 
wasted good hard money on. It's getting real old guys. Seems even 
buying the &quot;good stuff&quot; ends up not only sucking away but wasting my 
money, my time, and my enthusiasm as well.
