My brakes are sticking.  Because of the temp of the rear hubs, I believe it to be
the rear brakes.  After sitting overnight/a long period of time, they are perfect;
they stick more as the brakes are used.  When they stick, the single break light
stays lit.

Bus is a '55.  Put a new single circuit master cylinder, wheel cylinders, hoses and
shoes in two years ago.  I don't drive my bus too much, but the first 5000 were
trouble free.

Since the problem started, I have re-adjusted the brakes and left the rear a bit
loose.  I also flushed the lines and found no rust, dirt or water.

Because the brake light is on when they stick, I think the problem is near the
master cylinder.  I think something is clogging things and keeping pressure in the
line.

When I pull the master cylinder, where should I look?  In the reservoir?  In
internal parts of the cylinder?  Or on the exit side of the cylinder?  Or could
trash be in the line just outside of the cylinder and being sucked-in with use?
What is a good way to vacuum the line clean?

Thanks for the insight.

Also, very happy the list is running. Thanks for a great job, guys.
