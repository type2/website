If any near-by listees are up for a campout this weekend, give me a ring. A
few friends and I are taking the Westys to Tahlequah to float the Illinois
River. I know Josh Rodgers organized a camp there once before; If you didn't
get to make it last time, now is your chance to see why Josh enjoyed it so
much! Hope to hear from a few! Thanks,
