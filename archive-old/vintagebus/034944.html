BTW, lowered buses CAN be UNdone.  If I remember right, a fellow listee,
Sam, with the help of Clara did just that to Sam's 63 single cab
recently?  That sound right Sam?

actualIy, I raised it back up, with help from him, and from Chris.  :)    Rode
a heckuva lot better too.  And now he's redone the front seats (with Chris),
so they are comfy, but the front shocks are too stiff, but it sure is a good
truck.   And higher geared than my 59, BTW, which seems really to prefer
50mph.  me slow, even with the bigger than stock 40hp motor. (Dood, I got the
FAT motor, dood.)    They had turned the torsion bars in the back, not
switched to a no reduction gear box tranny, so the whole deal was done in I
think  two afternoons (look in TYPE2 achives if you are interested)

Oh, and the back is taller in his 63 than my 59 probably because he has the
correct 15&quot; tires and my 59 has 14&quot; ones (which were a little low on air too).


and as to the

 &quot; Lowered-Buses-Are-Nasty-Crack-Hos-I-Don't-Want-In-My-Family &quot;

 thread, I do not claim to be the lowering guru (please no!) but I have seen
how some were lowered,  and some impression of what does and does not work.
Willing to learn more.   I know what works for me is stock height.    I have
also replaced the torsion leaf springs on a bus where they broke, making the
wheel fall off (luckily, no one was hurt, which is pretty lucky, to be
repetitive and redundant), and so am really wary of people taking them out.
As well missing some leaf springs makes it ride really jouncy, and have
replaced leaf springs on two buses. ( I have some extra if anyone else needs a
set).    I would not lower a bus.     I dislike what people do to them a lot
of times, especially when they say, oh it's a VW lets modify it.  For example,
the radio area in my 59 was cut out a couple years ago to put a radio in it.
fairly recently.   Some jerk put a later style shift coupler, which hid
reverse.  (it was there, but unreachable)   Why not just get the correct part?
There was a reciept for $151.xx for the shift crap done to it that I had to
undo in order to back up.   Such a PITA.  Also drilled several dash holes.
And welded one up very badly so it warped.  I guess I'll cut it back out-
it'll look better  with a guage in it than that warped pile of rusty slag.
It wasn't through not wanting to spend money.  There were a lot of receipts,
but I don't think the knowledge was there.    I don't think the guy(s?) who
cut the dash,  or had the coupler done,  or did the weird wiring that I was
reorganising getting closer to the correct colour coding today,  or removed
the front turn signals,  or spliced the brake cables togther with nuts and
bolts but they are fraying,  thought they were doing anything but something
functional and cool.    Most of it I have to fix as I want it to be a safe,
well running bus, but some of it I want to fix to put things back to stock.
I won't keep Mr. Truck forever.    But he will be a better truck then than
when I got him, barring misfortune.

So what does that have to do with lowering?   A lot of the people who like
lowered buses 
seem to not worry so much about function as much as fashion.   It isn't an
issue if they will like that style in 5 years.   It isn't an issue if the ride
is uncomfortable or unsafe.   So I put in a couple cents , saying if you lower
it, spend money on the front suspension, don't just take out the leaves.
Anything can be undone , sure, though something take more time and energy and
skill, at least bolt on things don't require bodywork, though it's still work
and a pita.    And the very customized'll be like the shag carpet mobiles.
Tackily out of style.

    Now, you see, that I am  in my older and wiser days I prefer the classic
style of the Vintage VW, those pure art deco lines, the subtle shades of the
original upholstery (untill they got a bit extravagant in the mid/late
sixties, that is) .   No more hippy wagon or badassmobile for me, thank you.
Give me the Ragged Glory of the original paint, uncut, unrestored splitty.
Okay, I have a painted bus, now, but the tranny and interior need to be
finished, it's all torn apart,  and I have made a deal for more bodywork after
Jerome.
   BTW, my boyfriend has a lowered bus.
