&gt; have it on hand. But I like to buy lock washers too. The kind with a 
&gt; grip, you know, not a split washer, but a &quot;notched&quot; washer. This works 
&gt; for me.
&gt; Anyone else?

Yes! I have just done this job, and the thing to do is get some 1 inch
wide strips of galvanized 18 or 16 guage steel sheet stock such that you
create one of the following per side:  One strip will have three holes
drilled into it to pass the three vertical screws and the other strip will
span from the center hole to the separate hole and will have two holes for
the screws. Leave enough past the outer holes so that when you place the
first strip with the three holes into place and mount the outer vertical
screws (dont tighten), you then place the two-hole strip and mount the
center vertical screw and the lone screw. Then tighten following the
suggested tightening pattern in your Bentley book. when all are tight, you
then pry the corners of the strips up and jam them into the faces of the
bolts (screws). Your bolts are locked in place. 

Enjoy!
