&gt;Hi - first timer here.
&gt;
&gt;Could the 1600 upright engine in this bus have been transplanted from a
&gt;Porsche 914 like the seller implied?  It strikes me that 914s all had the
&gt;Type IV.

Find the engine #, it is more likely your engine could be a transplanted
Porsche 356 engine , they look sort of similar (not ). Most 914's are Type 4.
The 914-6 was powered with a 911 engine.

&gt;I should be getting a six pack of POR15 in the mail tomorrow to paint the
&gt;bottom of my bus.  The driver's side has the pan almost entireely rusted
&gt;away should I just remove the other which is mostly intact and then simply
&gt;paint the bottom of the floor panel.  Does anyone have a strong feeling
&gt;about the necessity of the pans?

??? Pans are good, they are necessary to keep your feet off the pavement ( and dry :)
Oh, i see- Belly pans, not the floorboards. Nevermind :)
