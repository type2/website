&gt;Question- Assuming that the mechanic didn't mix my oil bath with a 50-1
ratio
&gt;of oil and gas, can anyone think of how the oil bath might be getting gas
in
&gt;it and what this might be inidcating??


I had gas getting into my motor and had to replace the carb....float stuck
or sumthin like that.....
