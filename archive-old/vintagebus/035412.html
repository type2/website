&lt;&lt; Most of the foo foo shows all these people are at anyway, Classic,
 Barf-o-Rama's, but in my opinion again, I think that at OCTO (pre
 Classic),would be the place to hold the First Annual Type 2 Concours, the
 buses are there, the people are there, the need is there and a more then
 qualified panel of Judges is also present, more then just the fab 5, the
 magazines are there and a lot of big budget buyers who would pay ungodly
 amounts of money to own a concours certified winner. &gt;&gt;

Oh Great, is that what everyone wants? Take all this high dollar bus crap and 
shove it. Dont any of you people get it, just drive your f'n bus. They are 
nice and all that, but they were never intended as upper line show cars, they 
were intended to do work, the work buses work by hauling stuff, the people 
buses work by hauling people, the campers work by hauling camping gear, 
people, and providing shelter. Concours that.
