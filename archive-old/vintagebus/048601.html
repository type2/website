&gt;(5ft tall tanks are
&gt;heavy, and awkward to move....and if you drop it and bust that
&gt;regulator....yup.)


Funny little story:  One of the drivers (ex-driver) for the company that
delivers the shop gas bottles didn't chain down one of the full oxygen
bottles and it dropped off the back of the truck. When it hit the pavement,
it broke off the valve at the top of the tank.  The place that he dropped
the bottle was next to a local airport.  The bottle shot off like a missle
accross the runway and landed in a sand pit on the oppisite side of the
airport, almost a mile away!!  FAA had to come out and investigate along
with everyone else.

Those bottles carry a lot of pressure, treat them carryfully.  One of our
safety videos shows a bottle going through 3 cinder block walls and another
100 feet before stopping!
