Subject: Re: [VB] My bus loves grease...THAT MUCH?!?-----OG axle boot clamps/tool?


Better FLAPS will have the &quot;one-time&quot; clamps. There is a 
special but inexpensive tool that looks like a weird can 
opener/clamp to fasten 'em. I've seen smaller clamps at 
the local homebrew store for keg lines. I use modern, 
high-tech ratcheting nylon cable ties.

&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way to get OG axle boot (like the heater tube clamps)
&gt; clamps and I assume a special tool is required to use em? I have the
&gt; brass gear clmaps on my one piece boots, but they go all the way tight,
&gt; and still ooze a little when I park...Annoying... I need like one more
&gt; notch in the clamps....Are they, if available, reuseable?
