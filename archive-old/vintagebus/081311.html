Subject: re:  transaxle front mount and nose cone bushing

&gt; Can I loosen the
transaxle by removing the rear support bolts and disconnecting the shift
coupler (which will be replaced) and the front mount nuts, then pull it back
far enough to replace the front mount and tap the bushing back into the nose
cone?

I tried that once.  After tugging and pulling on it for an hour I realized I
was never going to get that final inch I needed to clear the studs.  I
pulled the whole thing out, a lot like wrestling an octopus.
