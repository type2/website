Marcus,

When I rebuilt my engine last June I ended up with the distributor 
drive being out of position. I don't know by how many teeth. The 
result is that the distributor has to be rotated about 60 degrees 
counter clockwise for the rotor to align properly with the notch 
when #1 is at TDC. Not a great problem but it looks a bit weird.

Alas I am an amateur and despite taking a long time to carefully 
assemble the engine I have left my mark (vide Steve Elms comments).  
I AM proud of my work but it was probably as a result of my lack of 
experience that I had to put the cases together three times before I 
got it right. Something was bound to go wrong. I am lucky 
that it was only the dizzy being out a bit. I guess it's the price 
you pay for having a go at it yourself.


Ian
