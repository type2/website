Subject: wiper &amp; crank out window parts

Hi guys,

I am back on....I am sure you missed me desperately, right ;)

Well I returned to new window cranks for my EZ-Camper crank outs, my
original ones were thrashed, so the windows were rattling all the time. I
sent Blaine Hardware one of mine, and they were able to customize one of
theirs, it fits pretty well, I needed to modify the glides a bit(this is the
part that actually slides back and forth in the window). But now all my
crankl out windows close nice nad tight, with no rattling....

I also returned to a broken driver's side windshield wiper....a few months
ago I had taken the motor out and regreased the thing, as it was moving so
slowly in the cold weather, but I didn't grease/lube the wiper shaft &amp; crank
where it passes through the threaded wiper shaft bearing...so I guess the
reason they were binding aside from the 35 year old grease was the rust
forming inside here. Anyway the crank end of the shaft sheared off...and the
shaft is rusted inside the hollow rod. I took the passenger side out put it
on the drivers side, and now it works pretty good, but now I only have one
wiper....I also believe this is a one year only part (1965 wiper shaft &amp;
crank) SO I recommend to all-lubricate this thing damn it! I don't see any
type of gasket on this thing to prevent water from getting in and causing
rust again....am I missing something?

Does anyone have any leads on a wiper shaft and the hollow threaded rod for
a 1965 bus?

I don't think I will be able to apss inspection again without this...

thanks for any help....
