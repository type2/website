&gt;I let one guy waste 5 who minutes looking for a muffler bearing; I told 
&gt;him it was for a Porsche, but it was also the same as a VW.

Yeah.  It's rare to find a parts place that has muffler bearings;
usually you have to mail-order them.  Try KaleCo at
http://www.kalecoauto_dot_com/general.htm .  Rex Rogers turned me on to
this source; the universal lowering kit they sell is really inexpensive!
