That'll work fine (well, as far as mating up is concerned, I wouldn't
run an engine like that).  The other way around fails, because the
fresh air tin on the muffler interferes with the engine cooling tin.

If I remember your original posting correctly, it sounds more like the
J-tubes from the front exhaust ports are either too short, or are too
large in diameter.  If the former, they've probably simply burned away
some.  There are &quot;repair kits&quot; available which are installed by
cutting off part of the old tube, sliding the new one on, and putting
a clamp on it.  If the existing tubes are too big around, then you've
probably got such a kit, but it was installed incorrectly (or someone
with a welder got over-enthusiastic).
