Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

Hi John,
We agree with the others on this list in that you really need to get a gas 
wire feed welder to do the job right.  We have an old Hobart Handler which will 
do about up to .125&quot;, if one welds both sides will do up to .250&quot;.  For the 
VWs we have that is thick enough unless you plan on armor plating your ride!  
You get what you pay for and only can make a good decision by doing some 
research and stopping in several welding supply shops for thier opinion.  Which will 
hopefully give you an idea how each shop treats you and thusly which you might 
want to buy from.  Then later if you have a problem you can go back directly 
to them for ansewers/help instead of dealing with someone long distance.
