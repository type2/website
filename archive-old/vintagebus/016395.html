:  &gt; After I get my two girls down to bed I plan to try and get the '66s
:  &gt; engine going after twenty-two years of sitting.  I plan to change the
:  &gt; oil, new spark plugs and wires, and a full tune up.  Am I missing
:  &gt; anything?  Does anyone have any tips for this glorious event?

Well, since I haven't seen anyone else mention it....

Does it turn freely as it sits?  It'd be disappointing to try to start
it, only to find out that the pistons have rusted solid to the
cylinders (the starter and/or flywheel damage kind of
disappointment).  I'd definitely do the pre-oiling others have
suggested, then turn it over by hand a few times (plugs out), then if
that all goes ok, turn it over with the starter.  If things still
look/sound good, put the (new) plugs in and try to actually start it.

The look/sound good thing includes getting a gas smell out of all four
plug holes (the above is a good way of priming the fuel system).  It's
probably worth opening up the carb's float bowl to see what it looks
like before you get to the turn-it-over steps; if there's lots of red
gunk in there, you'll need to thoroughly clean the carb.  Similar
logic applies to the fuel pump (as well as inspecting the condition of
the rubber diaphragm).

There's probably more, but that's what comes to mind at the moment.
