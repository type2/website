Subject: horn repair

well my horn died recently. It was a replacement i put in shortly after
getting my bus. There were two problems with it-the wire that goes down the
steering column had been sheared at one point, and the splice job was no
longer holding, it had completely corroded from the recent downpouring of
salt on the roads. so i replaced the wire.

the other problem, when i took the female push-on connector off the horn,
they were covered in a lot of green corrosion looking stuff. so i gently
wire brushed it, and the male connector came flying off, completely
corroded. the replacement horn i got from WW, and it kind of sucked because
it did not have any way to cover the connections like the original. I had
put some type of gasket from a tube, but it lasted a couple years.

anyway-i figured this time i would try to get my old horn working
again.(luckily i saved it). I took it apart-which required drilling out a
bunch of rivets that were made of some lightweight metal. aluminum or lead,
not sure. i cleaned all the contacts inside, wire brushed and some spray
contact cleaner. unfortunately i didn't see the paper gasket until i had
mangled it.

i put it back together with a couple spring clamps as i don't have a bunch
of screws to put it together yet, and i wanted to test it. I then got a few
double A batteries together, until I got about 6.3V. The I hooked it up ot
the horn, and it is doing something...not sure exactly what, i am thinking i
just need to adjust the screw some. it makes a thunking noise, and it
appears as though the diaphragm just goes thunk against the coil.

I checked the archives with some help there from Matt and Eric &amp; Barb. I
guess the condenser gains then loses a charge, causing the contacts to open
and close. but in its rest state-the contacts should be closed, right?

some questions:
since i mangled the gasket-could i just use some liquid gasket stuff, like
permatex?
does it makes sense to just put it together, and adjust the screw with it on
the bus?
seems like if it is making that thunk noise-it either needs to just be
adjusted, or the double A batteries don't have enough juice to sutain a
&quot;BEEP&quot;. does that sound right?
