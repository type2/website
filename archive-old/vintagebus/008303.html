Well my $150 towbar showed up today - the one for the bus.  This thing is
built like a tank but I can tell right off that if one is going to be towing
over any hilly ground or big dips, the front of the bus in theory would have
a couple of dimples put in it.   But no doubt about it, the this towbar is
going to help me big time. I'm going to get some pix of it up as soon as I
get my laptop set up.  I've got a thinkpad 500 with a 500+ meg harddrive and
a friend of mine on Monday is going to help me install linux so that I can
have remote net access and be able to dump my dc20 every 6 photos.  The
camera was only $50 so what the heck.  I promise more pictures of stuff once
I get that laptop set up.  All fer now...
