Subject: Re: [VB] 61 rear brakes (turning Drums)

are the drums really grooved?   I don't turn drums unless they are.  I just 
do the muir thing... clean them up and scuff with sandpaper.  there should be 
specs in the Bentley.

Finally got the rear axles nuts off my DC so i can rebuild the rear brakes.  
I have looked in all my manuals and checked the archives but have not found
the actual diameters that the drums can be at and still be turned.  Anyone 
have these?  This is for asmall nut rear end.
