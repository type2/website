every old volvo owner i know has TWO (at least), whether in their yard, or
parked at a friend's house in a more downscale neighborhood
this is because of the difficulty/$$$ in finding replacement items.
i missed out on buying a complete (except for the bed) 51 ch_at_vy 1/2 ton for
$200 by one day... when the SO asked WHY i needed it, she failed to see
that being able to grab a part off a truck in the yard beat waiting for
weeks for shoddy replacement parts from china. so her 50 1/2 ton often sits
while i comb the yards for a frammistat or whatzit. and lemme tell ya,
while i have a HUGE vw yard near my house, ol trucks DO NOT exist in
junkyards; i have to go to san antonio or marble falls.
having a part that SORTA works you took off the spare car beats having one
that DOESN'T and trying to find a replacement while you have no wheels.



the point?
if you have a bus, you now have a reason to buy two :)
