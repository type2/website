Subject: Re: [VB] Headlights?

Hi Seth,
Go to Amazon_dot_com
Then do a search for &quot;Workshop Manual Volkswagen Transporter&quot;
  Buy the one for your year Bus, and do not flinch at the price.   When you 
get it you will be astounded at how much info you just bought....
  As for your headlight questions they are not making a lot of sense  to us.  
The main thing is to install the assemblies so the drain hole in  the chrome 
ring is down.
  BTW it is a good idea to mention what year bus you are working  on.  
1955-03DEC63 used one that had the adjusting screws at 5 and 7 O'clock  if you 
figure the screw that fastens the headlight assembly to the body as at a  6 O'clock 
position as when mounted on the bug.  The 03DEC63-67 headlight  assemblies 
have adjusting screws at the 2 and 7 O'clock positions.   Section E-11, pages 2 
&amp; 3 in the 1963-67 Workshop Manual shows how to adjust  these.
