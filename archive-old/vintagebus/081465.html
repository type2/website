Subject: BRake spring, the answer.

For all you folks on the list:

----- Original Message -----
From: Dan Epperly

I think you hit the nail on the head. The boss is open faced toward the spring
and sits outside of the spring, sort of cocked really. I imagine that's why I
don't haev enough tension. When it was out I tried to fit the boss inside the
spring and it did fit, but just barely.I guess I'll try it again this weekend.
What a PITA.

  Digging way down deep, it has been a long time since I have played with the
  underneath stuff, I think that there is a boss around the pivot point that
  fits inside the spring. If you don't get the boss inside the spring, and as
  I recall it is a little tough, things just don't work quite right.
