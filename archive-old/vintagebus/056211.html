Subject: Re: [VB] Has anyone noticed the continuing BFFY lie?


Actually, I sympathize with the original guy in the thread. If anyone's
interested, the money I put into my splittie comes from my working
extensively in many aspects of the publishing and printing industry. I am
very aware of the pitfalls at both ends of advertising. This might not be
the case here, but any contract I've ever been aware of could always be
renegotiated in view of the mutual interests of the customer and advertiser,
especially if the ad was running with bad information. There is no reason in
the world not to feel frustrated when things don't mean what they say, and
no reason in the world not to demand that stuff means what it says, period.

Ever.

In fact, there are very specific laws which speak to this in no small way.

But generally, anything less is obviously counterproductive for everyone
involved, which is hardly the intent of spending money on said advertising.
While the bottom line is profit, likewise nowhere in that demarcation is
there the goal to alienate of a prospective customer with what are, in
point,  attractions for a show that is sold out, folks.

A lot of places may have great face time beyond belief, but their
advertisements... umm... suck... and it's very difficult to reconcile the
two. So my policy is to advise a wary eye and to consider all, even valid,
advertising suspect. Accept no excuses. If there is no disclaimer at the
bottom of an ad qualifying the supply of a scarce item, the adverstiser is
walking a very thin line. It is in the best interests of basic commerce,
fercryinoutloud, to demand, from both ends, that what is printed means what
it says in very, very short order.

My one and only rant in six months.

Craig.
