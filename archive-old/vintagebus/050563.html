Subject: Re: [VB] changing front beam

--part1_62.178e9d78.2947af7d_boundary

Pete,
          I've done a few front beam swaps, but I've been able to do these 
swaps with the correct beams, hence when I did my 59' Kombi, it got 59' 
brakes, beam the works..  The different years of the beams interchange, 
although their part #'s are different.('56-'64   211 401 061F)  ('65-'67 211 
401 061D).  I'm surprised their is nothing in the archives.  I think is would 
help a lot of folks save some bread come wheel cylinder time.
          The other thing that comes to mind is their is a correct way to 
point those funny washers that the mounting bolts so thru, take a pic or make 
a note of which way they point.  I checked my manual and the torque for 
'56-'64 is between 65 to 72 ft. lbs.  Sorry I don't have the latter numbers.  
I might also mention that my manual talks about shims for the gap between the 
frame and the anchor plate on the front beam.  So if some fall out, they were 
their for a reason, although I've never seen any before.  
          Be aware, that that you'll be dealing with a lot of heavy parts and 
you'll need a tie rod separator and an extra set of hands (time to call in a 
favor from some of your larger friends)
          One last thing, this would be a great time to redo your swing 
lever!!
                                                                  Peace-hope 
this helps.

Used to say to many VW's to list
                                                                          
Finally counted there's 12 of'm
