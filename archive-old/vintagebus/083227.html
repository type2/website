Subject: Re: [VB] underside update...RobK's Oz twin can just about  done
    too..

Are you sure? I have heard that the positive ground is negated by their 
proximity to the South Pole.

Popping noises, lets see, corn? missing muffler? burned valve? boiling fuel 
in the carb bowl?

Good luck with the engine, Harry/Karl.

&gt; No they don't because it's positive ground down there and that counteracts 
&gt; the Coriolis effect.
