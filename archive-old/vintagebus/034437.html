Hey Stephen et al who are interested in a caravn to Yakima from the Seattle 
area, this is what Bob Freeman sent me....  I think he means meeting at 10am 
Sat,   I live in Oly, so am not sure if that is the easiest route from here, 
will look at a map between now and then.

&lt;&lt;  We are meeting at 10:00 am at Charlie's restaurant in
 Enumclaw.  It's the last thing on the way out of town on Hwy 410.  You can't
 miss it.  We'll drive over Chinook Pass (with a stop at the top for photos)
 and get to Yakima probably around 12.  The cruise-in starts at 1.  Since so
 few have committed, I haven't made reservations at the KOA.  Greg Gonzoles
 suggested that we drive back up 410 and camp at one of the campgrounds along
 the river.  Since the weather is supposed to be perfect this weekend, that
 sounds like a good idea to me.  You can still stay at the KOA if you want or
 at the Park where the show is.   See you all at 10:00.
