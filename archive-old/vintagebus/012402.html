Any bussers want to tell which are the top 5 or 6 vw shows for the NE???

hi Rex
I suggest the Great Canadian Bug Show In Toronto Ont Canada.
It doesn't have BUS in the title, but every year there is more and more 
buses there, last year they had over 300 vehicles, i am guessing that 
there were about 30 or 40 buses
August 14 and 15th. The 1999 Great Canadian Bug Show will be held in 
Toronto, at Centennial College

Also Very close to USA is the Niagara Volks Folks 
June 19/20: Niagara Volks Folks present the 13th Annual June Jitter Bug! 
Niagara Falls, Ontario. Activities include a Cruise, Swap Meet, Car 
Show, Engine Blow and the 'Clutch Eater'! For more info. e-mail John's 
Bug Shop. bugshop_at_vaxxine_dot_com
I like this show as it is held in a very comfortable park setting, grass 
and trees for shade. good swap and venders etc
