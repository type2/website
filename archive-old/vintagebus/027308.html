Havana, Florida, that is -- clear at the other end of the state from
Cuba.

A week ago Saturday I got a call from David Rodriguez asking if I was
interested in checking out a local junkyard.  Seems the owner, who ran a
repair business and had a couple of acres of cars (not all VW), passed
away a year ago and the family was disposing of the junkers and would
eventually scrap them.

I'd heard rumors of a yard in this vicinity but some halfhearted
searching by me and Steve Curvey a year ago didn't turn it up.

We arrived and a whole line of junk Beetles was visible from the road. 
Made our introductions to the proprietors seated at a yard-sale-like
table in one of the shop buildings, then toured.

There are probably over 20 Beetles, of which at least half dozen are
pre-68.  Two splitty buses, three loaves, one Ghia, a couple of later
Type IIIs and a couple of 411s.  Not a huge pile but it's all gonna be
crushed after next weekend.

To make a long story short, Steve Curvey and I went back the next day,
then the next Saturday a dozen of us from the club met for breakfast and
descended on the place.  Wotta party - and a junkyard hunter's dream,
since there was plenty of help, advice, and tools available no matter
what you wanted.  Day ended nicely at a local deli/beer joint/pool
hall.  I wish we could do that every month.

I post this to share a positive club experience and to let others within
hailing distance know that the vehicles - what's left of them - in this
yard will be crushed soon and there are still a few worthwhile parts on
them.  I can't offer to go get what you want, but I can give you my
estimates of what might be there.  For example, there's a Sundial (?)
with a pretty whacked interior but with 4 of those single-pane jalousie
windows on it.  I already got a set of six multipane jalousies out of an
otherwise gutted 66 westy there.  Prices are not yet rock-bottom, but
not unreasonable.

If you're interested, please respond directly and I'll be happy to give
directions and my estimates on what's left.  I might try to go back out
there this weekend (I keep thinking of parts I normally wouldn't go
after, but they're being crushed!).
