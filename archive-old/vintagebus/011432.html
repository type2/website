&gt; drove it back from California, and the PO was driving it like this for
&gt; around 1 year, including a few 500-mile trips.  Oh yeah, and the end
&gt; play seems a bit large...  This almost sounds like a joke, is this
&gt; engine totally worn out and about to blow up?!?

I've seen some motors with really bad end play that were still
running.  I helped work on this guy here in town's baja buggy,
on which you can *lift* the crank pully by squeezing the belt!  But
that thing runs like a champ, with gravity holding the crank
down, I guess... My '59 had loads of end play, and ran like 
butter.

&gt; 3. If I want to completely remove the rear axles from the
&gt; transmission, including brakes, axle tubes, etc., do I need to
&gt; dismantle the reduction boxes in any way?  Assume a '63 rear end.

Yes.
