George and All;

I've had genuine German metric fuel lines fail in less than a year, and I've
had them look brand new after 5 or 6 years [all on the same engine/vehicle].
There definitely seems to be a variation in quality, even with the
&quot;official&quot; fuel line stock.

The best US fuel line currently available is Coast Guard approved marine
fuel line for &quot;gasahol&quot; and other altered fuel compositions.  I'm not
positive, but this stuff may come in a metric-equivalent size as many stern
drive packages are based on European engines.  I've used it on a GM 327 V-8
marine engine, and it was clearly superior to &quot;standard&quot; US fuel line stock.
It's a bit more expensive, but worth it.

Another possibility...  Some automotive applications now use a nylon/teflon
semi-rigid tubing in parts of the fuel system.  In other applications this
stuff seems to be really tough and impervious to nasty fluids at fairly high
temperatures.  Might be worth looking into it.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; If that's the case, it would probably be better for US VW drivers to go
with US-spec line, even if it requires the use of clamps (which you should
be using anyway). &lt;&lt;
