Well, my all original EARLY '59 Westfalia (production date of 11/5/58) is an SO-23 kit with yellow and black wool, so that throws out the previously posted logic.  My understanding is that the color of the wool fabric is not indicative of the year, but of the exterior color of the bus.  Dove Blue bus = yellow/black.  Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey bus = yellow/black.  Red/White bus = red/black.

I always thought the &quot;campbox&quot; kit was pre '59.  But, a friend of a friend just bought the Mango bus that's been up for sale in the So. Cal. area for the last few months, with the &quot;dealer provided&quot; original campbox kit similar to Thom's.  This bus originated in Carpinteria , CA. just a few miles down the road from Santa Barbara.  It's supposedly documented that this bus came from the delaer with and early campbox kit.  And we all thought '61 only had the SO-23 kit.

Yet another example of how VW never stuck to it's own rules all of the time.
