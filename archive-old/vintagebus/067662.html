Subject: Baywindow gas tank fit

Good day vintagebus drivers, I hope you are all doing well.
My gas gauge has never worked, so the last time I ran out of gas I vowed to 
do something about it. I've got hold of a baywindow tank (with what I hope 
to be a working sender) but I am really not happy with the fit of the tank 
in the bus. It seems to me that a large proportion of the weight of the tank 
and contents will be resting on the slight hump above the tranny bellhousing 
while the center of the tank remains unsupported. The tank does not seem too 
sit level; the forward edge sits on the &quot;shelf&quot; as it should, but the rear 
rests on the &quot;bellhousing hump&quot; rather than flat on the &quot;shelf&quot;. Is this a 
problem that others have found? What did you do about it or what am I doing 
wrong? I've checked out Thom's writeup on vintagebus_dot_com, but he makes no 
mention of having trouble getting the stupid thing to sit level.
Thanks.
