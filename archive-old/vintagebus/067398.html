&gt;It all has to do with the density of stored energy. A pound of gasoline has
&gt;approximately 100 times the energy of a pound of lead and acid. The
average &gt;ICE (internal combustion engine) delivers less than 20% of the
energy in &gt;gasoline to the driving wheels. The rest is lost as heat.
Electric motors &gt;deliver more than 80% of the energy to the wheels. The
challenge is clear... &gt;develop better energy storage for electric motors.
The motivation is to reduce &gt;consumption of non-renewable petroleum and
pollute less. A 1995 study says the &gt;average private vehicle trip was
11.8 miles in 20.1 minutes for a speed of &gt;35.4 mph. EV's fit this need.
EV owners can borrow, rent or maintain a second &gt;car for longer trips or
use trains, buses or planes. All this technology is &gt;worth studying, it's
as sure to come as the oil supply is sure to dry up.

Considering that most of the electricity that would charge the battery in
a Lead/Acid EV is generated by coal, fuel oil or GASP atomic energy aren't
they really just adding additional energy overhead and shifting the
location of the pollution? Even fuel cells, the pie in the sky savior,
will require the development of a huge infrastructure for producing and
delivering the fuel cell fuel. Many of the best FC systems seem to lean
towards methanol based fuels because hydrogen FC have severe storage and
delivery safety problems to overcome. Today in Nebraska it is 10F and
snow. Batteries are terrible in cold weather and the need to heat the
interior of an automobile would drain the battery even worse. I still say
we have a long way to go before we find a viable alternative
