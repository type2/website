I thought that seal to stop the flap in the closed position was only found in 
later 64-67 or so busses?
I put one in my 57 because it seemed to form a tighter seal.
Plan to do the same with the 56 camper.
I think they put a glue inside that vent at the seams of the sheet metal,like 
a black paste/rubber and it deteriorated.
Lookslike rat droppings up there but they are really dried out rubber.
Both my 56, 57 and 58 busses had little rubber bits to keep the thing from 
smashing when int he downward position.

&lt;&lt;I bought tags (and new plates, though DAS 061 is taken in WA years ago, so 
lame plates) for my 61 today, and took it for a test drive.  In the less than 
oppressive heat outside, I decided I better make the fresh air vent work 
properly.   SO I used the impact banger wrech with the phillpsbit on it to 
remove the 14screws, which works a lot better than a screw driver.  Removed 
the cover plate, undid the keeper nuts (9mm) and loosened the slotted screws 
that hold the flap to the rod, breaking one in the process.  Removed the 
flap, and a bunch of junk behind it.  THis included a pile of rust, various 
wierd bits of rubber lying there (WHY?). Unfortunately I also reoved the 
rubber bit that the flap stops against when in the closed position.  Because 
I though it was bad, as one side was longer hanging down that the other.  

I took the vent apart on a piece off a 65 panel it had 8mm nuts around the 
set screw for the flap rod, and no rubber flap stop seal?

I then dismember the vent from a 64 standard, which had either 8 or 9 mm 
nuts, and a rubber flap seal, I removed it, and found the same assymytry as 
the one from my 61.  Upon closer inspection it was made that way, not ripped, 
ditto my 61.  

SO now... I am wondering which side goes where, and what are those other seal 
buits that were in my 61?  loose forward of the flap.  I check the 63 
Workshop Manual, and it shows how to take the flap off, but not the seal that 
stops the flap.  stupid book.
