&gt;When I touch the
&gt;brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a =
warped
&gt;drum. What the?
&gt;Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not =
make
&gt;any sense to me.

Ric,
  The tire apes used an impact wrench, right? Zipped each one on to full =
torque and warped your drums. Take it back and have'em torque them to =
spec, 85 ft/lbs. IIRC, or loosen and torque them yourself in a star =
pattern.
