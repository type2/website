I have one stripped lug bolt hole on each of my rear drums.  Any way to
repair this?  Or am I stuck buying new drums?  (58 single cab with
big-nut rears)

no way to repair it that I'd feel comfortanble with.  It will hold with 4, but
I'd definately get replacement drums.   I'd give you some, but you prolly
don't want to pay shipping from WA.  Bet you can get some cheap from a local
bus head who has extras.   You want the ones to match the tranny (64-67) not
the original ones for the bus.
