Yes, you can get the bearing at a normal bearing supply house.
Get the *bearing* # (don't have it handy - need to put that on
my site!) not the VW #.

Eric &amp; Barb &amp; Clara have this stuff memorized...

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; does anyone have the dimensions for the outer and/or inner lower
&gt; bearing(s) on the small nut redux boxes?
&gt; the lower outer bearing is part # 311 501 283.  There is a bearing shop
&gt; here in town and I'd like to see if I can get the bearing locally before
&gt; ordering one...  I'm trying to get this thing back on the road ASAP.  I
&gt; was talking to a VW shop here...and the guy thinks that the outer is a
&gt; standard bearing that I should be able to get from a bearing
&gt; shop....does anyone have these bearings laying around they could get the
&gt; numbers off of?
