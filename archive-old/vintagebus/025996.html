&gt;&gt;Anyone see the &quot;NOS&quot; 28 PICT carb currently at $250.  My question:  Why is the &quot;VW&quot; logo on the side machined off?  My first hunch is that this is a send-back.
&gt;&gt;
Someone offered me an NOS 36hp fuel pump a little while ago like that.  He said the VW was machined off because it was original VW stock that was sold to a non-VW-owned parts house so they machined all the emblems off before the sale.  Weird...

I didn't go for the pump but it was more because it was the wrong style at the wrong price.
