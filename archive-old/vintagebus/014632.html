Hi Gene,
First get a good set of tires with a high wieght rating of at least 1500 Lbs. 
each.  The higher the wieght rating the better.  Next install a good set of 
shocks.  If you do not have a antisway bar on the front suspension, either 
find one off a 1966-67 bus or buy the bigger dia. more stiffer aftermarket 
availible now.  All of the proceeding will help greatly with side winds and 
semi trucks passing you not to push you around so much!  If all of this does 
not do the trick then try the rear suspension camber compensator.  If you 
still are having problems you need to slow down or invest in a Porsche or 
Ferrari that has a lower center of gravity.  Eric&amp;Barb
