This is not a new concept.  Rodders and restoration shops have been using
these for 20+ years.  Only recently since people have begun to feel that VW's
are &quot;worth&quot; doing a complete restoration are these legitimate restoration
devices being used in the VW community.  Could you imagine anyone wanting to
do a full on restoration bus 25-30 years ago??

Mo of the Transporter Garden has had a 50 single on one doing a resto, and
brings it out at the OCTO events.  It is the only way to go...so they say.
