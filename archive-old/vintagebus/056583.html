Subject: Re: [VB] shift rod tube

Look at Kelly's site www.metwiz_dot_com, he has some pictures of a front
crossmember that he replaced. His solution was to cut the crossmember so
that he didn't incur alignment problems with the shift tube.
His site is a real treasure of information if you're doing a restoration.

Subject: [VB] shift rod tube


&gt; Hi there, I've got a quick question. Is the shift rod tube welded to the
&gt; cross members that it passes through? I'm replacing the frontmost
&gt; crossmember, but don't want to remove the shift rod tube if it's welded to
&gt; all the good, non-rusty crossmembers. Anybody have some insight into how
&gt; this is done?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; JesusV
