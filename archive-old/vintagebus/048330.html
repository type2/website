I've seen copies of a binz lit. that was dated 53.
Earliest I've seen.
I think it was all drawings though, didn't see any actual photographs.

Ooooh, Harry raises a good question.  He asks *when* the first DC was
made...not *what year* it was made from.  How do we know a '54 Binz was
made in '54.  I know for a fact my '63 Riviera couldn't have been converted
in '63.  Does that now make it a different year conversion?  Hmmmmmm
