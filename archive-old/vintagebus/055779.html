Subject: Re: [VB] body panel removal

Personal opinion, here folks , so  no flames please, i would use a cutter
wheel , 4' round by 1/32 thick or one of the little air body saws, ( just
got one of those pretty cool little tools). A air hammer tends to be a bit
rough on the surrounding metal even with a crows foot bit, also one blooper
could be a bitch to fix. As Thom said you can take it loose at the spot
welds or leave a bit on  the edge and weld it back, as for spot welds i take
a standard 5/16 drill bit and resharpen the angle to more flat and use it to
remove them not the little hole saw looking things .,,later
