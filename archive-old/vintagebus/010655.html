Happy Friday All,
I just got my new copy of Car and Drivel :-) yesterday and there is a
multipage ad in there for Sony.  On the last page of the ad there is a really
cool picture of a Splittie parked on the beach with a guy standing on top of
it dancing with the moon in the background.  It has the small windows on top,
but obviously not the sunroof since he is dancing on it ;-)  I don't know if
they came without the sunroof when the small windows are present.  The purists
out there will set me straight I'm sure.  Anyway I think I will scan this and
let it be my new wallpaper for a while.

Other bus info.  It's been cold here in NE Oklahoma this week, but this
morning wasn't too bad so I decided to drive my '69 kombi to work today.  It
started fine, but I think I have a fouled plug.  It didn't run too well and
when I got to work (about 4 miles) I felt around and number one cylinder
seemed to be cold.  I run the Bosch WAC7 plugs.  Perhaps I should go to a
hotter plug for the cooler months since I don't drive it but maybe once a week
during the winter months.  Comments?
