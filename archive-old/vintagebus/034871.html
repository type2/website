 &lt;&lt;  I'm tired of seeing  &quot;show winning&quot; cars which are basically just a 
bunch of chrome goodies and cheesy display props. &gt;&gt;
 
 
 When I was helping Dennis rose back in the 80s at car shows we won all the 
time, normally best of show........
 
 with what ?
 
 the &quot;Krankenwagen&quot; yes with a chessy crash display etc.......
 
 Hell no it was not stock.....but it sure was FUN
============
ya- don't forget fun 

(BTW the quote he quoted at top was not me- but someone I quoted, FWIW)

there was a real sweet original slightly tatty SWR/BG flip top westy a young 
couple had just got from the OO, had been garaged most of the time, at 
vintage meet this year- got second in the camper class- I thought it was 
better than so many of the campers out there.

I think the idea of concours judging is interesting, but maybe I am a vintage 
pervert.  

 I voted for the oval window with the flower stickers on the windows, though. 
  

A thing we did one year at Vintage Meet was have a &quot;circle of honour&quot;  for 
showing the cars that were real nice restos and had won so many prizes that 
this way it would give someone else a chance, and there would still be a 
place to display them.  Such as BD's schwimmwagen.

Still never won a prize,  (except long distance award at Tucson in the 
spring) and not too worried about it.    Now if I poured some dough (attach 
hosepipe to wallet and smile) into my 53 and made it shiny i might.
