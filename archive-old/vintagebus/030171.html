Subject: Business partner

Anyone out there get a letter like this one below??  I have no idea who
this person is.  Seems like a form letter to me.  So, if anyone needs
proof that there is a concerted effort to take the &quot;good stuff&quot; out of
the country in mass, look no further.  This person is not just a
passionate hobbyist  ....this guys in bidnesssss.  This is with a weak
Pound too.

I'm sure there are US guys doing it too.

in on importing to the U.K, or just to find good
viechles out there for me. I have been into air cooled
V.W. vans for about 12 years. In restoration i am sick
of, continuous welding and paneling on the vans we
have here in the U.K. We have a very big show scene
here in spring right through until the end of the
summer. I am looking for good straight vans with
minimal welding, runners or non runners, to fill a 40
foot container, split screens, Westfalias. Good bay
