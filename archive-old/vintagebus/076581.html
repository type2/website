Subject: Re: [T2] 71 engine into a 65 Not!!!

&gt; I have the doghouse cooler setup on the 71 engine. So I had to use the 71's
 fan housing.  When I went to bolt it on the puley for the generator doesn't
 line up.  I found out a while back that I have a bug generator with a bug
 backing plate.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am confused. The 71 bug generator is a 30A and uses the flat plate. There is no difference where the
generator bolts on between either the doghouse or non-doghouse fan shroud. The only way you could into trouble
would be to use the longer bus 38A generator with the flat bug plate or if you used the wider fan in a
non-doghouse shroud. But the latter you did not do.
What is the length of your generator from the plate to the center of the pully V?
The early one with the flat plate is 7 1/16&quot;.
The 71 bus only 38A that uses the dished plate is 7 1/2&quot;.
