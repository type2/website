Was on the Glasurit site the other day, and i noticed the have this new
&quot;vintage paint hotline&quot; for NLA paint. claim they can cross reference
millions of outdated paint codes....so i assume they have their own as well.
 &quot; The Glasurit-Hotline on 0180 5 30 86 86 is open from Monday to Thursday
from 7.30 to 16.30, and open until 16.00 Fridays&quot;


&gt;I am trying to find a close match to L-82 Silver-White, the local paint
&gt;stores can't find the mixing formula for this color since it was used as a
&gt;&quot;trim&quot; color for bumpers and wheels. Does anybody have a paint color code
&gt;that is a close match?
