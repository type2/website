I have seen them, it was a cheapie aftermarket from JCWhitney. A friend in
NY state had one on his 64, very kewl, cheap, and functional. He went to it
after lots of cheap aftermarket round mirrors kept falling off..

&gt; issue of &quot;Hot VWs&quot; It looks like the ouside mirror attaches to the
&gt; raingutter rather than in the door hinge. Can anyone tell me where I can
&gt; get a set?
&gt; Thanks,
