Subject: Re: [VB] Center Pivot Pin Replacement

I tapped my top bushing out the top using a hammer and punch. The bottom
came out using the home made tool mentioned below. Taking the bushings out
was no problem at all......

The whole job was not that bad at all ....

I did delete a large metal spring washer from my rebuild kit on the advice
of a VW mechanic... plus there was never one on the original. You would
never get the whole thing back together with that washer......

&gt; You can use a couple of sockets, a 8&quot; length of all thtread and a few
nuts. Look at www.vintagebus_dot_com for Thom's write-up on how to do it.
