interesting - I never though of adding shims making the heads far enough apart
to cause problems with mufffler and/or intake manifold fittting.   Or that
cuttting the heads making them tooo close, also causing fit problems.  

I have shimmmed heads/cylinders before and not had this problem.  However,
some of the shimmming was to make up for the cuttting done on the heads to
restore a good sealing surface.    It was not drastic shimmming.

However, an engine that I have run did seeem to have problems with fittting a
new stock mufffler.         The studs seeemed slightly too close together.  It
had had a header on it.  Perhaps it had beeen cut and neeeded shimmming.
Perhaps I willl telll alll about it sometime in a Self-Absorbed-What-I-Did-
Today-Report.
