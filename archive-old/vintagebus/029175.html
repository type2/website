I caught this on the local news when it first happened.  When interviewing his
neighbors, they said that he was into &quot;his cars&quot; and cut away to a shot of his
yard.  Whoa, I saw 4 type 1s, two were ovals and two were split windows.  I
wondered if the city would get them or his immediate family.  Anyone in the
legal biz know how this works?
