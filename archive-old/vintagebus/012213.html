I owned a '61 Double Door panel that came with a bug tranny and a type IV motor cut into the back. The type IV was just as it came out of the later bus and they cut the sheet metal to wedge it in. I did a lot of research on using this motor and the DTM shroud from Oregon or a 911 fan and alternator conversion I believe seemed the way to go, both are very expensive. The booklet on building your own is very do able but you would definitely need a lot of time. The motor was beautiful to drive though. It was like having an automatic. With all the torque you could leave it in third gear from 20 to 55. With the proper conversion pieces I would really recommend this engine...it was really fun passing Subarus on hills.
