I resemble that subject thread! Remember that movie
entitled &quot;On Any Sunday...&quot;? Hell, I feel like
producing a movie about me involuntarily wrenching on
my '63 ratbus &quot;On Every Sunday.&quot; This past weekend it
was basic maintenence on Paula's '67 restomobile. The
day was topped off by my bride backing the '63 into
the wall of the house while backing out. Logic must
have been &quot;If it was pulled straight into the
driveway, then cranking the f outta the wheel must be
the way to back it out.&quot; My only response was to the
tune of &quot;That's alright, dear- at least you weren't
hurt.&quot; What's another Glasurit paintjob anyway...
(Grrrrrr!)
