What the American old car guys I used to deal with
used to suggest for stuck rings was ATF (automatic
transmission fluid).  The story was it's very high
detergent, and if you run a quart of it for 100 miles
before an oil change, it could unstick bad rings.  In
our lower capacity engines, I'd probably try 1/2
quart, but what can it hurt?
