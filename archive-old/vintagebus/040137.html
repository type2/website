Around here Rovers have become very popular with dot comers and the like.  A 
symptom of the SUV craz... ya gotta have em just in case it snows in the San 
Francisco Bay Area, Civilization collapses (or are we seeing it now?) or 
need to go offroad to get to the grocery. Good vehicles I understand... 
don't understand what people need them for to carpool the kiddees for.

&gt;I don't suppose there are too many Land Rovers in the US, but &gt;maybe these 
&gt;blades are available. If so, they're well worth a try.
