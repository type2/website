Subject: RE: [VB] Westy front sliding curtain bits?

you could use some from a vanagon, and they even have loops on them, which
makes attaching curtains easier.  they require no modification and slide
right in.  and i know this is a bad subject right now, but you could
probably ORDER them through the dealer or from one of the vanagon/westy
parts houses, or maybe even get some from a local junkyard.

&gt; We are going to make curtains for our Westy...we have the track from the
&gt; front sliding curtains, but all the little sliding plastic pieces are
&gt; broken.  Can someone please tell us what these are called and where to get
&gt; enough of them to make curtains with?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Gene
