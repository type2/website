Subject: RE: [VB] 6 volt to 12 volt-Solid state voltage regulators


&gt;&gt;Anyone have any ideas as how I can set up a 6 volt Southwind Heater to
&gt;&gt;a 12 volt bus?
&gt;
&gt;Sure.  Just replace all the blower motors, the ignition coil, and the
&gt;fuel pump/solenoid (if equipped) with 12 volt versions.  What?  You
&gt;don't have this stuff lying around?  OK, here is the answer you probably


i was curious - if one electrically insulated the unit from the chassis,
could you run a separate 6v battery hooked up just to the heater? sure,
you'd have to take it out and charge it now and again, but big whoop.
i have a 6v bug heater that i keep looking at putting in the s/c... plenty
of room for extra battery!
