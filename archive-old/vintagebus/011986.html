&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; everyone's talking about &quot;Leistrich&quot; mufflers lately.  Is this 
&gt; &quot;Leistritz&quot; (German brand) garbled or something you US guys'n'gals 
&gt; have and we in the Motherland :-) don't know?

Us folk in the Youess have a tough time spelling German words.  Any
muffler that starts with the letters &quot;Lei&quot; can be safely assumed to be
the one you mention above, which I cannot spell.

...&quot;Ha Ha!  We are just poking a little fun at Germany, which is
famous for enjoying a good joke, or as the Germans say,
'Sprechnehaltenzoltenfussenmachschnitzerkalbenrollen.'&quot;...  Dave Barry
