&gt;We know the type 3 scripts and they are punched out of aluminum  like the
&gt;Volkswagen script just under the rear hatch on  the post-1962 buses. 
&gt;This 1600
&gt;script is shaped, cast,  and chromed just like the 1500 bus script.


  do you remember the piece i asked you about in august? it was a 
'1600' script... shaped, cast and chromed. turned out to be a T3 
piece as far as anyone on samba knew:

bar joining each number together......
