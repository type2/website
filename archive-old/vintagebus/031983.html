Sorry this is so late.....I just spent the last 1 1/2 hours catching up on
the last 3 days worth of the list.

As for employment, I manufacture an ICF called LUXIT.  ICF stands for
insulating concrete form.  It's basically a styro foam concrete form that
stays in place and becomes the insulation for whatever building is being
constructed.  I believe that Luxit is the first ICF ever designed.  It was
designed in Europe, the molding machines (only 3 in the world) were built in
Europe (using Bosch pneumatics, BTW), and a lot of homes were built in Europe
out of Luxit back in the early-mid '80's.  There are presently around 25
different manufacturers of ICF's in the world and ICF's are the fastest
growing new product to EVER hit the construction industry.

Anyway, sorry again for being late and off-topic (does the word Bosch help?)
