er, excuse me, but isn't ebay a place to buy/sell things?   I think if you 
list something on ebay, it gives people the idea that you are selling it.    
And if you place a $3000 reserve on an item considered worth  much less, 
people may say  jeez what a freak.  Seems like there is confusion about 
whether the seat is for sale or not.    Maybe you just like having a rare 
seat?    Hell we all have some of that.  I like having a barndoor bus.    But 
I am not putting it on ebay with the intent of creating a stir and then not 
selling it.   Of course, now you say you did it as a kick, but  I think you 
might be leaving the impression  that people should not take you at face 
value.
