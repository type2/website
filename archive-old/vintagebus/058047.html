             I have a 1600sp engine that came with my bus. It runs well
 when you first start it up but after a few minutes it dies and won't
 keep idle. The engine if kept at a fixed RPM with my hand on the
 throttle will eventually die.  I checked the idle switch on the side and
 appears to be working.
 
  &gt;&gt;
is this a carb icing problem?   will it idle if warmed up a bit?

eventually die...hm- dying at idle makes me think clogged idle system- needs 
a carb clean out.  Actually, is this new to you?  first thing is give it a 
tune up if you haven't already- often that does wonders.   May have tight 
valves or cruddy plugs etc.
