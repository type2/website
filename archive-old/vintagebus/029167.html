Subject: Re: [VB] semaphore wiring and the elements
References: &lt;200008192136.e7JLa7n17686_at_green-dome.village_dot_org&gt;

Typically semaphore coils will just have a paper label of say SWF (the
manufacturer) wrapping around the coil and the small wire leading into the
light housing is covered with a thin cloth sheath. The larger wire from the
instrument cluster will have the regular color coded plastic sheath. It
doesn't really hurt the electrical system for water to get on the wiring at
that point. Kinda like headlights, turn signals and horn connections are all
exposed to the elements in some fashion. Maybe not directly but eventually.
Anyone else?

&gt; So, both sets of semaphores that I have appear to mount in such a way
&gt; that the coil and its connections are exposed to the outside
&gt; elements.  Somehow, that doesn't sound like all that good a thing
&gt; when, say, it's raining.  Is that really how it's supposed to be, or
&gt; are some bits missing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
