I agree.  While I've not been welding for anywhere close to 30 years, I
think I know the technique you should use.  Kelly I'm sure will chime in
here, but I was taught to butt the metal as close together as possible
and then use tack welds to hold it in place.  Spend more time trimming
and fitting than welding and your welds will be better. Spread the welds
far apart and continue to &quot;tack&quot; the pieces together, alternating from
one end of the panel to the other.  Continue to do small short welds
(1/4 to 1/2 inch) alternating sides to keep the heat down.  It takes a
long time, but its the only way to keep from burning through and worse,
warping the material.  Take your time.  You are using the smallest
diameter wire right?? .028 I think?

Check out Kelly's site http:www//metwiz_dot_com for tips and pictures of
what he does.
