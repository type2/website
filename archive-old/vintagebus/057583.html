Subject: I'm back

Hey Volks

Well, after nine-plus months of driving a splitscreen bus across Africa and
beyond, I'm back at home in Johannesburg and on the vintagebus list!

Thanks to all the listees who emailed us on the road. It was very inspiring
to get good wishes from VW volks around the world. And extra special thanks to 
all those who gave us support, both moral and by deed.

I have had the rest of my photographs developed and I have quite a few shots of
interesting split buses. I will add a bus page to the gallery on our website
just as soon as I can scan the latest pics. Keep an eye out at:

I'm busy composing a trip report detailing the (very few) vintage VWs we
spotted while crossing Africa. I'll post it to the list as soon as I'm done.

Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to getting back into the list chat. I've been
missing my regular fix, and going cold turkey for nine months hasn't cured
the habit ...
