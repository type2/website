Sorry Volks...

Looks like I won't be able to drive to Washington this week.  I'm running
out of time due to work project, not bus problem :)  I have to be back here
in Arizona by the 17th for the Grand Opening of Ronnie's new on-line catalog
( http://www.OldVolks_dot_com/ ).

I had really hoped to get together with the tons of people who offered...
bummed.  I needed a break and was really looking forward to the 3000 mile
drive.

On the good news front... No major problems on the transaxle install, my bus
engine and transaxle are getting the special treatment.  Even ordered a set
of Gene Berg linkage for the dual Kadrons (I have misplaced my original
linkage)... will report on it.  Should be able to drive the bus Friday night
or Saturday (the linkage may not make it Friday, we will see).

Wedding is coming up March 25th, so won't be going home to Washington until
April....  Planning on making the Spring meet!
