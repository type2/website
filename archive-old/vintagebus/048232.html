and in 
 what concentration? &gt;&gt;

Hi RobK,
We use phosphoric acid.  We do not know the concentration, we just ordered it 
through a local chemical supplier that would only do it in a 20 gallon 
minimum.  Told them we were going to use it for removal of oxidation from 
steel for sutomotive restoration.  When using on wiring we apply the acid for 
fifteen minutes and then rinse throughly with water!  After doing and letting 
this dry this or after soldering apply a dielectric grease to help prevent it 
from oxidizing for a good looooonnnnnnggg time!   Eric&amp;Barb
