Well I had fun in kali last weekend.._dot_despite hearing dean lowery passed
away Friday night, and being unable to catch up with Everett cause he was
runnin off with camera in hand everytime I spotted him :) I did see one guy
with a type2_dot_com cd shaped sticker on his shirt, but he was goin the
opposite direction across the way.
 I was curious what everyone's best buy of the show was? I managed to score
a set of NOS 55-57 bubble taillights MINT in the package for 450, and seeing
how the only sets I see are missing parts and all screwed up going for 300 I
had to jump on it.
 I heard there were only 25 busses in attendance to SOTO ...is this true?
