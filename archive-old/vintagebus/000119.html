&lt;&lt; I have a problem when I step on the brakes or turn on the signal the only 
thing that happens is the direction indicator in the speedo lights up. No 
external brake lights or flashers. &gt;&gt;
Hi Trevor,
Your brake lights are not grounding to the body so the electricity is 
rerouting back through the turn signal system.  Best if this is a daily 
driver to just solder grounding wires to the bulbholders (Especially the 
rears!), and hook the ground wires to the body.  Eric&amp;Barb
