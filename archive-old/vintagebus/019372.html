Ugh, it has those horrible scoops on it like mine.  Except -- hey!  Those 
scoops look better than mine!  Why is my Westy so fugly?? ;-)

If you're going to look at it, best thing to do is take it for a spin.  Then
you'll know if you can live with the tranny.  My Kombi had more play than...a
lot of things in its pass. rear wheel, and it made a helluva lot of noise
going down the road.  If it *howls* be wary.  If you jack up the rear and
run it in fourth and it sounds like a jet engine revving up for takeoff, be
afraid because it resembles my Kombi :-)

Bottom line is a tranny is a few hundred ($400 for me).  Redux boxes are less
with a fair amount of labor involved.  The price of a bus is a pretty 
subjective thing, IMHO.  I _liked_ my Westy before I bought it, I would have
probably paid near double what I did to get it (it was cheap).  Some other
bus, even in better shape, maybe not.  Subjective.
