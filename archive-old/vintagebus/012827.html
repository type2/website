&gt; &lt;&lt; In my case it wasn't a simple clutch cable... it was a broken
cross shaft
&gt; that holds the throw out bearing. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; Was the cross shaft one of those stock spot welded ones or the
beefier ones
&gt; with a nice welded bead or the splined on the shaft types?  We have
found
&gt; that it really pays to buy a couple of the stock one at a time and
have them
&gt; welded around the base of the arms to insure that they do not break
off.

Another trouble spot on these forks is the point at which the throwout
bearing pivots on the lever.  Over time, this tends to wear out and
then the end of the lever breaks off, casting the throwout bearing
adrift on the trans input shaft.

Whenever the engine is out, this shaft should be inspected.  If I find
a stock fork, I replace it with a heavy-duty fork from a dune-buggy
shop.

Before you install your new shaft in the case, be sure to try the
cable lever on the shaft splines.  Sometimes the splines aren't very
well cut and you want to find out before you put the shaft in.

Use a bit of anti-sieze grease on the cable lever to make it easier to
take apart next time.

The shaft is held in position by a snap ring inside the bell housing
that bears against the inside of the large bushing.  Be sure to always
use a _new_ snap ring!  Old ones will slip out of their groove,
causing an engine removal.  I also safety-wire the snap ring, carving
a relief groove in the adjacent washer to allow room for the wire.
