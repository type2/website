Subject: Re:  [VB] '59 Bus Front Door Lock Screws
To: RDAVIS_at_sbch_dot_org, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


List:

1959 Bus.
Front door lock mechanism/box.
The four screws that attach the mechanism to the door jamb, basically in a 
vertical line.
Are they all the same size and length?

Mine are missing, and as I recall 2 of the 4 screws are longer.
-  ----
yes two are longer,   but the threads and the heads ar ethe same.  for some 
reason I think the two that hold the door handle on are the longer ones.   
you can use the longer ones where the short ones go, if you dropped the short 
one in the tall grass and have an extra longer on in your tool box
