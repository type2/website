Subject: H4 Halogens on a Splitty??
Date: Thu, 17 Feb 2000 20:04:25 -0800

Hi Everyone,

    I recently saw the article in Hot VWs about installing Bosch H4 halogens
on a '67 &amp; later bug.  That got me thinking, why not on my splitty??  I'm
currently running low-end incandescent 12V lights that don't throw a lot of
light, especially in the valley fog.   Does anyone out there have first-hand
experience installing these on their bus.  If so, how do you like them??
TIA
