    I Parked my '64 westy at work today, after going to get lunch.I
parked it in a different spot than usual because the lot was full. I was
taking care of customers in my store when I noticed my bus was in the
middle of the parking lot.I ran out to my bus to find that I hadn't
engaged the hand brake! Luckily it drifted just past a semi-trailer and
turned just in time to miss the parked cars behind where I &quot;parked&quot;!!!!
. I guess I couldn't wait to eat that meatball sandwich I had picked up
at Grandpa's Deli!
-Moral of the story, become a vegetarian ?-
            your humble bonehead,
                            woody

ps. Hey Neil P., ever eat at Granpa's Deli ?
