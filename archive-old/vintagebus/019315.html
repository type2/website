Hi all,  

I'm flying to Dallas in two hours to work on both my '59 Double Cab Pick-up
(body work/prep) and my '59 Double Door Panel for the next few days.  The
last time I went, a listee (lost his e-mail) wanted to come over to the
shop and hang out.  I'll be there until Monday morning, so if you're still
out there and want to come by, call Dennis at Wilco Metal Inc., in
Princeton,TX at (800) 685-0619 or the home I'm staying in at (214)734-0413.
 Call and drop by for an adult beverage and Busses.

Bill Bowman
