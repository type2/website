oh,

i forgot to add, i was told you can see BETTER with the little round
mirrors because:

a) they arent really that much smaller than the elephants
b) the elephants have both arms bent the same (driver side bend) so unless
you bend your passenger arm to match the VW round mirror arm bend, you can
only use like the outside inch of your elephant ear anyway... (and if you
bend it itll look funny as the elephant ears are so big the position  
mismatch will stick out like a sore thumb)

This is all what i was told, i dont have enough personal experience
driving with either to really offer a personally informed opinion...

peas,

Steve
