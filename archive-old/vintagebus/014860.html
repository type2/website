Yes, do the polarization!!  Takes but a second for the time period.  For best
results and a sure polarization, hook it up, unhook, hook, unhook, - about 10
times. Each hook up need only last less than a second.

Was Writ:

The Bentley manual suggests polarizing generators which have been sitting for
a
   long while or rebuilt. The manual shows exactly how to hook up the wires
but
   does not say how long the process takes to fully re-polarize a generator.
Does
   anyone know this time period??? Or is this polarizing procedure worth doing
at
   all?

   Thanks,
