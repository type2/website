Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

I think that the fact that there are fewer Sundials running around than there
are Westys will make Sundials more desirable, and also more valuable down the
road..  My wife and I collect Arts &amp; Crafts, (Very heavy masculine Oak)
furniture.  When it was manufactured from about 1901 thru about 1916, bedroom
furniture was rarely purchased because it was too &quot;Heavy&quot; for most women's
taste.  Today, Arts &amp; Crafts bedroom furniture is pretty rare, and most of it
is much more valuable than living and dining room pieces that were comparable
in price at the time, since not too much of it was produced or purchased.

After all is said and done, I think the most valuable camper(s) to you is the
one you own, whatever the name of the Camper Conversion company is.

I don't know about others on this list, but I bought, own, and drive my Camper
with my heart, not with my head.  If my camper is worth more or less that a
comparable Westy, who cares?  &quot;My Camper is better than your Camper&quot; is pretty
childlike.  I will never apologize for my camper to anyone.  It really only
matters what your ride is worth the day that you sell it.  I plan on being
burried in mine.

Just my opinion.

&gt; Hey Chuck,
&gt;
&gt; I've had Westfalias, a Sundial and my daily driver for the past 11 years is
&gt; an EZ Camper. So I've always been interested in the variations of campers
&gt; and especially interested in non-Westfalias. From what I've seen, the later
&gt; campers are all about the same quality. Westfalia is a little nicer in some
&gt; regards, and Riviera is usually the lower one on the totem pole of quality.
&gt; They all have about the same layout, and if yours was a panel you won't get
&gt; the closet window as P&amp;C mentioned. My 66 EZ Camper was a panel.
&gt;
&gt; As far as resale goes, I think that a nice Sundial will outsell a beat
&gt; Westy anyday. But that's pretty obvious. Resale in collectible cars is like
&gt; any other hobby...condition is the main thing. You could have the rarest
&gt; bus out there, but if it's a POS you won't sell it (or not fast). Or, you
&gt; just have to find a sucker (like me) to sell it to! :)
&gt;
&gt; I've always said that it's much more difficult to restore a non-Westfalia
&gt; than it is to restore a Westfalia. You have to fly blind for a lot of it.
&gt; There's not that much reference material out there, and everybody has an
&gt; opinion on how it should be. Most people don't understand campers and the
&gt; hundreds of variations they came in.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps,
&gt;
&gt; Scott
