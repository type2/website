Subject: starter/rattle problem solved...sort of

as i stated previously in my idiot of the week award speech...as i installed
the solenoid incorrectly-hence the starting problems. i just did a little
test drive witht he solenoid installed correctly-no rattling noise.

i think i now know what the rattling noise is-the starter gear was rubbing
the flywheel, due to the fact that the solenoid was incorrectly
installed-and pushing the starter constantly into the flywheel.
with solenoid installed correctly-rattle is gone.

but now the bus wont' start. before i caught this error-i got basically
nothing out of my starter. now something is churning back there, i am just
not sure what-it doesn't sound like the flywheel is turning.

i am imagining it is the starter that is screwed up-if it was the
solenoid-the symptom would be nothing happening at all, right?

on the other hand it could be the flywheel. perhaps the teeth of the
flywheel got chewed up by the starter gear.

now i just need to find a place that rebuilds starters i guess, and have
them test mine somehow.
