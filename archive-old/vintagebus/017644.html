Subject: hidden rust chack?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everybody.

I was bolting the seats into my 67 deluxe sunroof bus,
and I noticed there was some water in there underneath
the mounting brackets. Just sitting in there, up to no
good I presume. Since the bus had previously been
sitting outside for some time, I can only assume the
worst.

Is there any way to check for rust under the cargo
floor? Is that area sealed from the seat mounts? There
is a (belly pan?) under that whole compartment, so I
can't look from underneath. There are no holes down
there, but the driver's side rocker needs replacing,
and the lip in the floor near the cargo door latch is
crusting away.

I'd hate to go through the expensive paint thing and
then have it rot from the inside out.

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks,
Jason
