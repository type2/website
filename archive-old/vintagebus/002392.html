20 coolers and adapters came from a known garage restorer of 20 some years
who
quit the biz. Would have ???? otherwise. I agree if a deal is to good to
believe then
sometimes it might be bogus. Traded 14 of the coolers away for tune up parts
for
the 1600s/p. The VW world is to small and tight to screw someone on parts or
cars/
buses, if you do the word gets around and you are done, thats why i love
VW'S and all the people involved with them. If someone screws or steels from
me i just call Kyle and he sicks his pigs on them and they are done. Could
say more but wont pass true/untrue rumors. The thieves know who they are and
so do we. On an upbeat see you all at BBB
III in Jan, 99. We will post more info as things pan out. ( like friday
night bus trip to
Laughlin and maybe the boy scout breakfast sun. morning) SEE YOU THERE!!!!
John Howard
