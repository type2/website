hey everyone!
  does anybody know Mike Kieffer who used to live in indiana but has
moved out east?
he is a good swapper who always had good old bug and bus stuff!
he is tall with short short blonde hair and drove a vw panel for years
then swapped out of a white f_at_rd v#n.
i am in need of a couple things he has for me but cant seem to catch up
with him.
Thanks for any help!!!!!
