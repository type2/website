You wrote..................................
what years offered cigarette lighters, if any? Were
they strictly a
dealer option?  I have one in my 63 (with a 62 dash I
believe - the
WHOLE front end of the bus was professionally
replaced..why they chose
the earlier dash I will never know)  The lighter is
chrome and the
outlet for it is placed under the ash tray on the
dash.  Perfectly
centered.  Looks original.  Dealer installed maybe? 
The lighter looks
very &quot;vintage&quot;  It looks to work, but with no wiring
harness and no
battery yet, I can't tell.
I've had some input as the dealers installed them to
the sides of the
ash tray....but who knows.

Isaiah ,
I saw on your web page with the pics, that you thought
that the dash was the wrong year because of the lack
of flasher indicator. I believe that the flasher light
is a one year only in 1965. As for the lighter, it
should be located(at least on my 65 standard)just to
the left of the wiper switch on the dash.
