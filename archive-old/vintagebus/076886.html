Subject: Re: [VB] 63 to 64 emergency brake cable housing different

I want to use the cable housing with the right ends to keep water out of the 
tube end and the backing plate end...  
Hi ISM6,
We installed a 1964-67 tranny, RGBs, and brakes in our Pearl White 1963 SC 
built DEC62 and the later E-brake cable tubes sealed and fit in just fine.  Same 
with our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion built in DEC1959, though the 
cables themselfs had to be shortend.  Just checked the RR cable on the panel 
and the cable tube is about 20&quot; long, so our best guess is the DPO cut off your 
bus body cable tubes.  The bus body cable tubes should reach rearward to 
about three inches from the front of the rear torsion bar tubes.
