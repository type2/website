&gt; I was thinking about *trying* to find some 16&quot; rims and then putting

&gt; but trying to find &quot;spare&quot; barndoor rims could really be more of a
&gt; hassle than its worth.

The barndoor rims would be way too narrow for low-profile tires.  The
stock tires were somewhere around 100% aspect ratio, not 50%!

If you really want to experiment, you can have just about any kind of
rim made up by Centerline.  Be sure to bring your Visa card!
