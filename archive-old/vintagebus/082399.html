&gt;&gt; That kid struck me as kind of a goober and if I were him I would sell the

&gt;...... its sill on the road, thats what matters. some of us want
&gt; to drive our buses instead of having them in various states of restoration
&gt; for 15 years never to move more than 20 feet at a time.
I'm not saying anything wrong with the kid he seems kinda typical splitty 
driver, What I have a problem with is the work the shop did. It was truely poor 
quality and the fact that the air vents are covered means he wont beable to 
drive it. 
Yes the drier must go.
