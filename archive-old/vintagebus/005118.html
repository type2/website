 As I sit here on my hands and grit my teeth  and type with a toothpick in
my mouth i wonder what the hell is going on. It is a wonder that so many VW
buses are running. With all the what temp, what pressure, what tire size,
what trany gear, what rpm, it is weird that any are still running. Do like
volkswagen did and just run it. If the dash lights go on stop and check it
out. If Volkswagen thought real gauges were needed they would have put them
in. JUST DRIVE YOUR BUS TO PRESCOTT THIS WEEKEND AND HAVE FUN. The world
would have been alot better without gauges, LONG LIVE THE IDIOT LIGHT!!!
Trust it. If not park your bus and enjoy looking at it. Pass me a beast Kyle
and lets enjoy the weekend.
