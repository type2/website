Hey all,

Any body got any tips on a head unit instalation on a 12v.  Now I have a 
cheap radio power wire going straight to the right fuse on the fuse box.  
This keeps power to the LED on the radio when the bus is off.  Any ideas on 
where to put the red power cord so radio is off when bus is off and where to 
put the yellow wire to maintain your pre-sets?

Anybody got a backing panel for a non walktru near upstate SC?

Thanks

Have a Great Weekend and Enjoy the Shows!

Eric
