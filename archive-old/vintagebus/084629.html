Subject: Fuel pump rebuild seal ? 

This is a rediculous issue I am having.

I have an old style fuel pump (40HP model I think) with the screw in fuel 
fitting.  This model has the fuel screen on top of the pump and sealed with 
a round paper seal and 8mm headed bolt.

The problem is that the top screen will not seal!  There is fuel just 
weaping out from the gasket area :(

Does anyone know where to buy a new screen and round gasket?  Or have insigh 
on how to seal it?

Thank You,
Adrian Pillow
