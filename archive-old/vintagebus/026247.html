The Hanes manual isn't specific enough.  Is the Alternator belt, like
the V Belt supposed to be given slack of half inch deflection?  And is
is supposed to be tightned after its broken in from new?  And in the
owners manual it says in 4th gear you can drive at speeds of 41-62. 
Does this mean 62mph is the cruising speed for a fuel injected 1600? 
The top speed for this type of engine is 83
My other question is about the 2nd generation of the type 2.  I'm a
little worried for a good friend of mine who likes to drive his type 2
with the rear hatch all the way open and way up above the bus.  It's
the back door that is hinged on the top used for loading and
unloading.  Particularly in the summer.  I'm worried he and his whole
fammily will get carbon monoxide poisoning or something.  He couldn't
care less, with an attitude that it only happens to others.
