Hey Volks

In my last mail I referred to a semaphore deluxe that I spotted last
weekend. I got a close look at it this week and took some pics, posted on
Thom's gallery:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/deluxe.html

Thanks to Thom for making this valuable resource available to us all.

The bus is a 59 RHD Deluxe. The back is crammed full of trash, and it has
fairly extensive rust throughout the lower part of the bus. Otherwise it is
pretty much complete, including the bumpers with their deluxe trim, which
aren't in the picture. The bus runs. Most deluxe trim is there, missing one
rear jailbar, and most of the engine vent trims.

M-tag looks like this:
30    01    9
368    007    008    108    178
SF    244    BGR SR    434109

368 seems to be a package: the bus has six pop-outs and safaris. 007 and 008
are unknown; I suspect something to do with dust-proofing. 178 is a rev
limiter, and 108 is allegedly SO42 camping gear. Since this bus is a 59 and
SO42 first arrived in 64? I guess it means something else. The bus does have
a curtain rail all round, but whether that was part of camping gear or a
later addition who knows.

SF export code means the bus was an official import into South Africa.
Deluxes wewren't assembled here, only Standards, Kombis and panels.

This Deluxe is for sale, but the owner is one of those cagey types who won't
talk numbers, and who is clearly waiting for the gold-plated offer so he can
retire on the proceeds of the sale. Well, at least that means I won't be
buying *this* bus ;-)

And while we're on Thom's fabulous gallery, check out a pic of my 57 Kombi:
