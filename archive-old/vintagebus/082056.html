Subject: $475 Westy F.S. near Cincinnati

Its a 69 westy, has an unknown tranny and 1600 engine
included but not installed, other than that, a
complete bus, $475.  Clear Ohio title. Some through
rust under the windshield and some small-ish spots on
the front floor, other than those spots, not too
rusty. Good for resto or buy for parts and double your
money!  Heres the link:

Contact the seller thru theSamba ad, it is his bus,
not mine :-)
For an extra hundred bucks I will also throw in an
additional rolling shell from a 78 bus that has all
the metal needed to repair the 69.

Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
