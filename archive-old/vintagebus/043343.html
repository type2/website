&gt;Being I have never driven a bus with a middle seat or paid any attention to
&gt;how many clamps holds it in can anybody enlighten me.
&gt;
&gt;I have a pile of clamps, base plates and T bolts but I don't know how many
&gt;and what parts to use.

Just wondering if the seat clamps are what I found in the usual PO parts
box in my '64 Microbus.  They are flat metal pieces - four are cast and
two are stamped steel.  All are about 3&quot; by 4&quot;.  The cast ones have a
VW logo and 221.883.861 cast in the &quot;top&quot; and the &quot;bottoms&quot; have various
markings like 2a, 2b.  They have a bolt with a T-head through them and a
piece threaded onto the bolt that looks like it would clamp something
round into a groove on the plate.  The bus came with no middle seat,
but I'm guessing that's what these are for?

Thanks!!
