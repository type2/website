  Thank you, I for one am &quot;new&quot; to the Bus part of VW'ing and  
was/am looking forward to traveling to shows, campouts, etc.
I was VERY disheartened to see this riff happen.  When I 
was a st##t rodder, I had to put up with the same CR*P.
Let's move on and enjoy BUS'IN.  
   I'll see you all in Jerome.
