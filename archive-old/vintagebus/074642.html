Subject: Re: uplifting

-------------------
&gt;It's going inside the new shop once it's completed,
&gt;but since it's 'portable' I couldn't resist...
Are there some sort of supports you'll add when it
goes into the workshop or is it a whole lot safer if
it's bolted into the concrete?
I know I'd take a step back and a very long think
before I decided to put my bus up on that, let alone
get underneath it the way it is at the moment.
Granted, $2500 or there abouts is a whole lot cheaper
than you'd pay for a 2 post heavy duty hoist.
:o)
------------------------

A friend just bought a house with a workshop and of course immeidiatly 
started investigating
lifts and actually DID get a heavy duty 2 post lift, rebuilt, installed, 1 
yr guarantee for
$2000 installed.. It takes up alot of space but he thinks he can store one 
car on it and the other
under, which i wouldnt do but of course works.
