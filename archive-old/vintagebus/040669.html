Is a split window bus a reliable daily driver...say between about 1963 -
1967? I have a chance to buy a 1981 deluxe camper ($2000) that needs a
tranny ($1500 new w/clutch if needed), and I like it but what I really want
is a split window camper. However, I live in Wisconsin and would I be
happier with the later model bus in the long run (it has a working gas
heater)? I hope this email does not annoy the other listees and is an
appropriate post. I guess I want to hear the selling points of the split
window vs. anything later and why you drive a split. Finally, would it make
the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).
