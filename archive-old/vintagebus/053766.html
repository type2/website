Subject: [VB] Re: Double Cab Canvas

What is that saying about opinions...Look, if the
stuff is cheap don't buy it. If you don't like who's
selling don't buy it from them. YTou can usually find
the direct supplier anyways, if you do a little
homework. If you're selling something that is less
than an original, fess up. Most people when given the
chance will seek out a closer to original item rather
than one that only resembles it. Except those who
wanted safari windows BCE (before Creative
Engineering). We ALL got bad copies! 
Besides, you can't even hook a tent to the side of a
double cab so who even cares about 'em! :) I am of
course kidding, so please keep the harsh replies to a
minimum.
