hey all,
i was thinking of the AIRS decal thing, i sent a post, but i think i just 
replied to Ronnie at type2parts. anyway, i am a graphic design manager at a 
print shop here in cleveland and i think i can whip something up. we have 
this transparent label stuff i can run through my canon color laser's. i 
could mirror image when i print, and you could stick them on the inside of 
the windows. just need permission to use the logo. i just dont know if the 
sun would fade them. BUT, the lighted AIRS thing sounds really cool... check 
this out!
