&gt;When you put the loaf gas tank in your bus, did you damage the sender?  It
&gt;sounded like you had to kick the thing in there pretty hard?  How do you
fit
&gt;the filler neck and all the other crap on the tank so you could use it?  I
love
&gt;the constant pictures, as you are about 6 months ahead of my progress!
Keep
&gt;up the great posts!


No but it was very close!  When I fixed my sender, I used a bolt in place of
where the brass rivet used to be and this bolt was sticking up high enough
to cause a problem.  It was a difference of about 1/8&quot;.  I got out the
Makita grinder and ground it down and it just cleared - and I mean JUST
cleared.  It is a very tight fit that requires patience, flexing of the
cargo area above the engine, and some long skinny arms.  I didn't have to
kick the tank in very hard as I have pretty big legs but it was making some
pretty good banging noises while I pushed it in.  I dread having to pull
that tank ever again if need be.

As for the filler neck, I bought some actual fuel filler hose - one foot
cost me $20!!!  It's really good stuff though.  Anyway, the filler neck on
the baywindow tank points more upwards.  Simply putting a piece of hose over
the end of it seems like the solution but the clearance is so tight between
the filler and the cargo area above the tank.  What I ended up doing was
cutting the filler hose at an angle and then it went onto the tank.  The
problem though is that if you cut at too much of an angle, you won't get a
good enough seal on the tank.  Tipping the filler hose like this makes it
kind of tough for the hose clamp to do its job because it comes real close
to not being able to seat squarely on the filler neck but I got it to work
using a thinner width clamp.

Attatching the old filler neck was no big deal.  I slid it in the hole
behind the gas flap, and then using some duct tape, kind of held it in place
where I wanted it.  Then looking in from the engine compartment, I could see
where I would need to cut the tube at.  A trick I used in order to make my
cuts better was to use a hose clamp on the tube.  If you use a fine tooth
hacksaw blade, you can run it right up against the hose clamp and it will
follow the clamp until you get to where the housing is that holds the screw
that tightens the clamp.  Then you just gotta loosen the clamp, rotate it,
clamp it (carefully aligning it up with your cut), and finish hacking away!
Makes for an amatuerishly good squared-off cut.


Thanks for the compliments and questions.  I've posted this to the type 2
list as I felt it contained some helpful info...
