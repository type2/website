Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Towbar

&gt;short of using a trailer.

I've done tow dolly's, tow bars, tow ropes, ect. Everyone do yourself a
favor. If your gonna be towing a bus more than once in your life, save up
and buy a 16ft. trailer. It makes everything so much easier. Plus, it comes
in REAL handy for other things (like moving). I more than made my money
back on mine in the 1 1/2 years I've had it. You can find them for anywhere
from $750 and up. I've helped friends with their busses as well. Much safer
than any of the other alternatives IMO. I even bought an '88 Ch*vy Suburban
to pull it. If you don't want to buy one, then find a local mom &amp; pop
rent-all place and rent yourself a flat-bed or a car hauler. Just makes
more sense. I decided all of this after having a drum come off a single-cab
I was towing on a tow dolly....wheel and all! I had my wife and kids with
me and the van I was using to pull it was all over the road. No more for
me! Now I get all four wheels OFF the ground.
