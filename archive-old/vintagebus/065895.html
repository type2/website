Subject: RE: [VB] Radio Wiring

The seamed double brown is your speaker wire. One of the browns may have a
black line or a broken black line. That is the low side of the speaker
output, but not of any concern. Of the three wires on the other  the other
side, the brown is your dash light wire to light up the radio when the head
light switch is on, the black is ground, and the other could be a orange,
red or yellow, or striped wire, that is power. On my Sapphire IV it is a
black wire with a yellow stripe.

Subject: [VB] Radio Wiring


I have a Sapphire II am/fm radio that I want to install in a '65 bus.
The radio has several wires that I need some help to identify: 
 
1)One brown wire that is double stranded(two wires seamed together) comes
from the right side of the radio. 
2)On the left side of the radio is three single wires, two of them
are black and one is brown.

Can anybody help me identify what is what?
