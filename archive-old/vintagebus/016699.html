 i am an AIRS member, el centro ca. is 60 mi from
anything, day time temps during the summer  frequently
see 113 deg. evenings may cool to 90. if anybody is
brokedown or just needs a place to chill for a while,
they can contact me. if you are afraid of people,
perhaps you should unsubscribe. we met a lot of great
volks folks this last weekend at OCTO/classic. 
later, jay
