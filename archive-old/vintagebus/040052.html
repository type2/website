Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Front Striker plates?

Eric,
Unless I'm mistaken, the '65 striker plate will have a 3 screw pattern and 
the '67 will have 2. I am not sure about '66, but is probably the same as 
'65.  I just went through this with my '67-'65 &quot;conversion&quot;.
Hope this helps.

&lt;I've got some 67 doors waitin to go on my 66&gt;
