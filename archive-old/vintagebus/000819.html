Hi Isaiah,
If the engine is turning over well then it probably is not due to too thick 
of oil in the engine.  Which if you are in an area that rarely goes above the 
freezing point it would be a good idea to install 10W oil in both the engine 
case and the air cleaner.  Plus when filling the air cleaner make sure to add 
about 1/8&quot; less than normal.

  Could also be that you need to adjust the choke a to a little less rich, 
and often it needs the fuel pressure lowered to prevent flooding the engine 
with raw fuel.  Since it is so cold the fuel just does not vaporize as easily 
and then coats the spark plugs grounding out the already weak spark.  We have 
a winter service booklet for VW of Canada Ltd. that explains the reduction in 
fuel pressure from 4.2 PSI to 2.0 PSI for type 1 &amp; 2 engines.  The real trick 
is not to lower the fuel pressure so low that it affects the higher RPM 
functioning of the engine.  
VW of Canada even offered a choke cable conversion for the 1961 and later VWs 
to get rid of the auto choke.  Part No.  X 115 102.  Can anyone in Canada 
check around to see if this is a kit that can still be found?
   Most likely though you may need a new battery or clean and check the 
connections.  At 80F a fully charged battery will produce 100% output.  At 
32F only 65% output.  At 0F only 40% and so on.  VW actually sold a double 
clamp ended positive cable for the bug to install a second battery (Under the 
rear seat.) to to double the amperage for starting power.
