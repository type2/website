Subject: RE: [VB] ebay and sales tax
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My wife sells Longaberger baskets (handwoven -very
strange items - but supports her basket fetish) and
all she has is a credit card machine.  Her tax id is
her Social Security Number.  If asked for a tax id,
that's all she has to supply to a potential buyer.  

I'm trying to talk her into letting me sell buses for
a living, that way I could keep as many around as
sales would permit!  Right now, she has over 100
baskets all around the house, and has not paid for a
single one of them.  She's been selling them for about
10 years, and has people every once in a while
complain about paying tax.  The funny thing is, since
we live in New York, only people accepting shipments
within this state have to pay.  If my mom buys a baset
(she lives in Maryland), Kellie can ship it directly
to her and she doesn't have to pay tax.  I think it
has to do with Kellie not being authorized to sell in
the state other than where she makes her primary
residence...

Just my .02 (JM2C?)
