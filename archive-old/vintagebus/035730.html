&lt;&lt; Is it possible to place a late model beetle front end in to a early kombi

 as I am wanting to have disk brakes on the front.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
No and even if you did the brakes would not be strong enough for the bus.  
Making it want to do 180 degree spins especially when brakes applied during 
wet or icy road conditions.  Check the archives for using 1968-70 front beam 
with 1971 and later disc brakes.   Eric&amp;Barb
