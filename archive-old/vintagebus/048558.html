&gt;&gt;I didn't do a thing to them but now that I'm driving they squeal
&gt;&gt;like mad when I'm moderately (normal) stopping. If I really stand on the
&gt;&gt;brakes it goes away. Today I took the wheels off repacked the bearings
&gt;&gt;(for my road trip to Utah in May) and I readjusted and cleaned up all
&gt;&gt;the brake stuff. I figured I'd be good to go. But noooo. There just as
&gt;&gt;loud now as ever.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like your drums are glazed. If you had (have) hoses that had failed
&gt;internally and do not let the fluid return to the reservoir, you will get
&gt;glazed drums from the heat. If you have not replaced the hoses, do so at the
&gt;earliest possible convenience. As for the squealing, get some really rough
&gt;sandpaper and go at the inside of the drums. Do not sand anything, just
&gt;scratch them up. Really. Don't sand. Scratch. All in circles or something.
&gt;Make them kind of unshiny all the way around. I like 40 grit paper from a
&gt;floor sander for this. Should take care of it.


The really fast and easy way to stop squeels coming from a glazed drum is
to take a butter knife and put some dry powdered &quot;Comet&quot; cleaner inside
your drum through the adjusting slot.  Problem solved, no squeel and the
comet will just fall out of the brake after doing it's job.  And best of
all, you don't have to remove the drum!!
