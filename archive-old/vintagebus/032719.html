&lt;&lt; Where exactly is the ground wire that attaches to or near the gas tank.&gt;&gt;
Hi Patrick,
The one end of the ground wire is connected to the sender and the other end
is screwed to the body near the tank.

&lt;&lt;  Also, can I remove the back/closer to front engine tin w/out dropping the
engine.&gt;&gt;
Front is always front!

&lt;&lt; Ie: remove gas line and starter bolt plus 2 engine tin screws.
Yes you can, but first make sure you understand how the tin goes in front of
the engine case and those two sheet metal tabs reach over toward the rear.
Since you are interested in getting your fuel gauge working you would
probably be better off pulling out the engine and have full access to it and
the fuel tank.

 &lt;&lt;Thanks for putting up w/my LAMO questions. &gt;&gt;
No Problem, Eric&amp;Barb
