I changed the changed the cv boots on an 86 gti the inner was still okay
so all i had to change was the outer.  All i did once i pulled the shaft
was use a ball pin hamer and a large screw driver to work the metal slip
joint loose. Once loose I picked up the shaft and let gravity help free
the joint by tapping the joint some more.  Once the axel was split i
actually used a GM universal boot( roughly 12$) to replace the factory
one.  THe only mistake I made in puutting things back together is I left
off the very thin wassher that goes on the shaft before the axel joint.  
I knew the job was going to easy and thats when I was the washer I left
off.  Without the thin washer it was ten times more difficult to get the
screw driver inserted between the joint male the lower part of the male
shaft. 
I realize this is off topic request.  I'm just trying to help. We've (wife
included) fot a 1976 westy with a 2l in it that we can't to restore.  I've
got a another car (cavalier) going on second rebuild, to get gone before I
can start on my dream bus.  

I need advice on the following to get started on my bus:  2 bbl carb.
rebild, replaced push rod shaft oil seals, terrible leak, and severe rust
that I hope to fix using lead.  I have a bunch of lead from my sheet rock
cousin who gets lead for his race car from redoing doctor X-ray rooms.  So
I need so step by step instructions on leading.

&gt; anyone know where I can obtain a good description of
&gt; how to?  The Bentley description seems incorrect and
&gt; incomplete (remove bottom ball joint by removing 2
&gt; bolts, but there are 3 bolts, and why remove them?)
