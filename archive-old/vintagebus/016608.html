Subject: Any parents?  I need advice!  :(

Hi all I'm still dealing with horrible gas mileage. The list of answers for 
my progressive Weber has been short and with few answers. Can I ever get 
this to be efficient? Or even close? I need advice.  Am I wasting my time 
with this &quot;performance&quot; Weber STUFF that the PO decided was a good idea? 
Time is of the essence for me. I am supposed to be leaving for a 900 mile 
trip in a bit more than a week. I have another car at my disposal but I 
really wanted to take the bus.  :(

The bus is running like a real champ but not at all effecient.  Would I just 
be safer and faster dropping the money into a used Solex and new intake 
manifold? Is a solex setup any closer to a sure fire way to better gas 
mileage.

Again the facts are
1600 DP
32/36 Weber Progressive
15 mpg in town

Please I need Help!!!!

Thank you all for the assistance,
Scott
