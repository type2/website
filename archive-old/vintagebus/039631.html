&gt;Subject: [VB] How much oil?
&gt;Date: Mon, 7 May 2001 11:12:33 -0500
&gt;
&gt;I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there is 
&gt;a
&gt;spin-on filter attached to it.  I know to fill up the filter before I put 
&gt;it
&gt;on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill up, too.
&gt;Should I put the oil in the lines before attaching the hoses?  Or should I
&gt;measure how much oil the hoses hold, and add that much to the 3.5 quarts in
&gt;the engine?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I want to do it right :-)
&gt;--

I put a fram racing filter on with about 3 feet of line. I didnt know how 
much oil to add either. What I did was put the required amount of oil in 
then about 1/2 quart more. Then I disconnected the coil and turned over the 
engine with starter. It wont start of course but will push oil. I did this 
in short bursts, checking and adding oil as I went. When no more oil was 
needed I finally hooked up the coil and fired it up.
