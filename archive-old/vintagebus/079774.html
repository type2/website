Subject: Re: [T2] 1967 Front Bearing Nut

&gt; I've heard from various sources that the late model hex nut for keeping a
&gt; front bearing in place, should work for my '67.
&gt;
&gt; I tried this over the weekend and found that the nut from my '71 didn't
&gt; want to screw onto my front spindle with only fingers used for the
&gt; tightening.  I don't want to force it and strip my spindle, but I'm in a
&gt; bit of a bind and kinda need something RIGHT NOW.

tom
there are right handed and left handed threads. so you need one of each
nut.
other than that if you loosened the allen lock nut it should thread right
on with your fingers.
unless the axle or nut threads are a little buggered or rusty.
