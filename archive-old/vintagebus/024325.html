Hi Markus.
I ended up doing SEVERAL engine pulls to fix an oil leak from the donut
gaskets that were supposed to work but didn't (assuming you're talking
about where the original oil cooler mounts in the tin).  The fix was YET
another engine pull, shit can the doughnuts and make or buy the iron
shaped gasket using good thick gasket material made for the purpose. 
World of difference, and the tinkertoy don't leak.

Of course it's not running right now due to flame burnt head, but when
it's running it don't leak there!

Good luck and let me know how you make out.

Dave

 Does the oil cooler adapter use a gasket?
 My books  mention those o-ring-like things, not an actual gasket that
sits between the engine and the oil cooler adapter.
