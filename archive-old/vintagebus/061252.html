Well, since you are pulling off a 009 there isn't really any good
reference for where the vacuum pot should be. At least visually if you
have been staring at that 009 for a while :). Since it's pointing to
#2 instead of #3 at least you shouldn't be 180 degrees out. I would
double check the distributer drive (just to make sure even though it
is most likely correct [0]). It should point toward the TDC mark
though. Just loosen up the nut &amp; rotate it to near that mark. Drop in,
set timing, rave about how nice a vacuum advance distributor is :)

[0] Bentley has this info.

&gt; spark plug and felt with a pencil to confirm TDC)  So, what the hell is goin
&gt; on here? Is it just as simple as changing the plug wires around to match the
&gt; dizzy TDC mark?
