Subject: '59 Bus Front Door Lock Screws
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA19133

List:

1959 Bus.
Front door lock mechanism/box.
The four screws that attach the mechanism to the door jamb, basically in a vertical line.
Are they all the same size and length?

Mine are missing, and as I recall 2 of the 4 screws are longer.

TIA.

Robert
