If someone on the list has a digital camera and has their front bumper off
(or has a project sitting around), an acquaintance of mine would like a nice
photo of the front bumper mounting bracket underneath the front door on a
60s Bus.

The picture is so he can repair/replace his bracket.

Thanks,
Everett
