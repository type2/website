&lt;&lt; Timing is 71/2 BTDC with Vac hose pulled, goes to 33deg full advance at
 1900 RPM with vacum line on.&gt;&gt;
Hi P&amp;C,
At least drop the full advance to 30 or better yet 28 and see what that does.
 
&lt;&lt;Any idea what I could have missed that the temps are still going up fast???
 The big problem is the outside temp.  The higher it is the less differance 
for the engine to cool itself.  Knowing what top RPM you are cruising at 
would help.  Also did you seal the outside of the oil cooler to the doghouse 
shroud with foam tape from your FLHS?

&lt;&gt;
We just take a large washer in between the left thumb and forefinger and slip 
it on the bolt.  Then do the same with the nut giving it a clockwise rotation 
to engage the threads.  This can be done by one person, but is alot easier if 
you have a helper under the bus to push the bolt rearward.  With the engine 
out we weld a locking arm to the bolt head to go over the tranny bellhousing 
to lock it from rotating and drill and to tap a bolt into the bell housing 
and attach a spring to the head of the engine mounting bolt and to this new 
bolt to spring load the left upper engine bolt.
