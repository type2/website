I guess I need to amend this question because I got so many answers about
the history of gas tanks in buses.  The part is &quot;Gas Tank Divider Panels&quot;.
Sorry for leaving out the panels part.  For thoses not having experience
with pick-ups, it's a pair of panels that divide the storage compartment and
the gas tank compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been searching for a pair of gas tank dividers for my '57SC.  I was told
&gt; there was a change in the design in '65 and another in '68.  Does anybody know
&gt; what these changes are.  I've been offered a set from the '65-'67 era, will
&gt; they work ?

By the way, I took delevery on a new bed last week.  It looks and feels like
the orginal.  The end of this week we remove the old bed and prep for the
attchment of the new.  I plan to take lots of pictures and will post a how
to on the vintage page.  It's major surgery and have to tell you I'm excited
and scared.  I've had this pick up for 25 years and I feel like it's part of
me.  The hip replacement that my mother had worried me less.

Thanks,
John

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
