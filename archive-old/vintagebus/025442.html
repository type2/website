I think the term is 'richer' in this case.;&gt;) I have not had the problem here in
Florida. From what I understand, you can drop one jet size for Denver. Can't
honestly remember where I read that though.

The 34 is too lean for the advance curve of the 009. I have had nothing but
problems with them. The 30 PICT-1 is just about bullet proof.
