Beetles followed the bus lead and had a cowl type air intake above the windshield?

Also, surf to http://www.washedashore_dot_com/projects/dymax/index.html to see a transporter built in 1933. I wonder if the bus designers in Germany had seen this vehicle? The specifications are amazing, to say the least.
