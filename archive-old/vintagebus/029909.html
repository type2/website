Don't know where you are, but here on the East Coast we have a chain
FLAPS called Trak Auto that stocks Sta-Lube multipurpose 85W90 gear oil
that is rated API/GL-4.  Comes in quart (and larger) containers.

&gt; Sorry to bring up an old subject (one I didn't pay complete attention to),
&gt; but I am faced with replacing my tranny (soon, Ronnie, soon) and need to get
&gt; re-educated on gear oil.  As I recall, GL-5 is bad, GL-4 is good.  I called
&gt; my oil supplier that I use at work and asked for a gear lube with only a GL-4
&gt; rating.  They could not come up with one.  They did, however, come up with a
&gt; lube saying it meets GL-3 and GL-4 specs.  Would this be acceptable?  The
&gt; person I spoke with read some of the label for me over the phone and it says
&gt; that it is for &quot;older&quot; manual and &quot;semi-automatic stick shift&quot; transmissions.
