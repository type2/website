Subject: Re: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

&gt; If the nylock nut were to loosen (not at all likely) the steering would

I forwarded your suggestion to my co-pilot (Murphy) 
as this may be the exception he has been searching for !
He replied, asking for the torque spec for the rear wheel nyloc:)

If the nyloc got loose, you might find it half a mile back,
loosely attached to the broken stub of the tie rod (could happen:)
Lots of people out there on the road with worn-out steering tonite.
They usually get tagged only at inspection time.

I've never seen a loose castle nut. 
They are also reusable. ( Nylocs are single use fasteners).
Castle nuts look vintage.
