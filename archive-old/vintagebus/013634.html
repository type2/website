Well, looking at it from their end, the waterbug people are folks who
will drop $20K on a whim.  Once the NB is in their driveway, they are
on the lookout for geegaws to dress it up.  This sells advertising, so
it is a good idea (from the advertisers point of view) for the mags to
push the current watercooled stuff.

If you want to see good stuff about buses, join Neato or Limbo.  They
have nice magazines that discuss nothing but our buses.  No bikinis,
either!
