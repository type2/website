Ah yes but it also could be 130,000 miles, does it have the original engine
in it? Is it still the original speedo? Kinda of hard to tell the mileage on
a bus thats been sitting for years!

Subject: [VB] 30K mile field bus questions



Friend of mine found a '66 bus with about 30K original miles.  Been sitting 
outside for several years.  Pretty rusty but has a lot of good parts.  I'm 
mainly interested in the mechanical parts.  Anyone have any insight as to
how 
the trans, reduction gears, steering box, etc, might be after sitting
outside 
for a couple decades?
