Ugh..._dot_deer.  I try not to drive much at night during hunting season up
here...they're everywhere then...trying to avoid getting shot...scared.  I can
understand that they would be scared... I'd be scared too if some guy in bright
clothes came running after me with a gun in one hand and a beer in the other....
not to mention the folks from IL who come up here to WI to hunt.  No offense to
you guys...but every other car has IL plates up here in deer season....up north
where I go anyways... and a lot of people think that deer season is a great
excuse to get lickered and drive around....
Anyways...
My friend hit a deer at 40mph with his 78 bus.  It bashed in the front really
bad...there was a gap between the body and the windshield...the front was all
crunched in... it was nasty.  The bus was, to him, totalled.  He later traded it
for a nice little 412.  I can't imagine what it would be like hitting a deer in
a split at 60mph.  It would really hurt your bus...and probably hurt you pretty
bad too if the deer was of good size and you hit the whole deer...not just one
end of it.
I remember driving through Maine and parts of Canada over the Great Lakes and
seeing moose warning signs.  I was in the semi with my grandpa...and we saw a
guy who hit a moose with his semi.  It came right up over the front end and into
his lap through the windshields.  Nasty stuff....imagine hitting one of those
suckers with your bus!!  You may not live to tell about it.... Stop for them in
the road...and sometimes they'll get *upset* (especially if you honk the horn I
hear) and start thrashing your vehicle with their enourmous antlers.....That
would rip right through the front skin of a split.  Thats just from what I've
seen/heard while up there....never had any experience with a moose (probably a
good thing)

&gt; Those of us in the mid-west need those for the deer around here! There's one
&gt; around the corner from my house on the highway that looks as if it exploded
&gt; in a Monty Python movie set..._dot_can't imagine what a split would look like if
&gt; a deer winds up looking like that! Venison, anyone?
