Hey Volks,

just wanted to say the list is great.

need to replace a couple of wheel bearings on the 66 std.
is there any particular book that will outline this job well?
also, should I do all four while I'm in there?

on top of that I've a leaking nose cone bushing which is a
big jobber I know, but the same q&amp;a  goes for that as well...

I tend to replace wheel bearing as they go bad.  Most books are fairly clear
on doing this job.   (grease tip du jour- make sure your brake adjustment
stars are greased where the threaded bit of it is for ease of brake
adjustment)

about the nose cone-  is it leaking really bad?   A puddle every time you
leave a parking spot-   if so you better deal.  If it just oozes and makes
the tranny a slimey mess, ignore it and call it rust prevention.    Do check
your tranny oil level if you are concerned about a leak especially if it
drips.   it should be up to the bottom of the fill hole.   I like to change
my tranny oil every year.   (yes I really like to)

Clara
