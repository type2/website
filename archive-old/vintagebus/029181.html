&gt; Actually with the question &quot;is it a degree pulley?&quot; causes me to ask...
&gt; Do the degree pulleys not have the slinger grooves? I kind of wanted to
&gt; put one on but if no grooves then I guess not.

I just put an EMPI degree pulley on the new mexican 1600 that I'm building...and it DOES have the slinger gooves...  so...all should be well.  I was very pleased with how nice the EMPI pulleys are... and from what I hear...they're dead on accurate.
They're a bit spendy...but worth it for accuracy in my opinion... and hey...why not?  you get a sticker with it!  ;-)
