Boy do I love to take my bus rescue equipment (rusty old 200 mile F*RD 3/4
ton with 16' flat bed trailer in tow) and hit the road with the promise of
bringing back another bus for the collection.

The first stop was 6 hours away in Oklahoma.  A friend wanted to trade a
'66 hard top Westy for a '71 Westy that I had.  He wanted something to camp
in with a pop top and even though the '71 was a bit crusty, my friend is a
body man and should have the bus back on the road in no time.  The bus he
traded me is pictured in Josh Rodgers camper web site.  Josh did at one
time own this bus, but sold it to my friend a year or so ago.  I don't know
who has Josh's web page now, but this bus has a picture of the interior .
A small amount of rust here and there, but the body is pretty straight and
the interior is beautiful!!  The '71 came off the trailer, and the '66 went
on.

We now went down the road to see another collection of VW's, but first a
stop at a VW shop with a few parts busses.  I located a westy with a
strange cabinet arrangement.  I don't know the year, another car was pushed
up against the driver door, but I would guess a '74-'75.  The bus was a
walk through with the steel partitions behind the seats.  Behind the driver
was the sink and some drawers, behind the passenger, just inside the
sliding door, was a 120/12V, propane refrigerator and propane stove.  The
back seat was full width and could not fold down into a bed.  There was one
small cabinet on the drivers side behind the seat.  The bus had the big pop
top with the full sized bed.  The bus was wrecked and was passed saving, so
I bought the stove/fridge cabinet out of the bus for $20.

We went onto see the next collection of bugs and busses, but what really
caught my eye was a really straight and rust free '76 westy.  The interior
was beautiful with the propane stove and 'fridge.  Everything was there and
in really nice shape.  The only problem was last time this bus was driven,
the battery tipped over and caught the top of the engine on fire.  The fire
was put out pretty quick, but destroyed the fuel injection and put smoke up
the side of the bus, no damage to the body other than paint.  When I asked
the owner what his plans were for the bus, he really didn't want to sell it
because he had so much fun in it, but did agree to sell it to me for $400.
I really will enjoy repainting and camping in this bus.

I believe this now makes 4 sun roof deluxe, 3 hard top walk through deluxe,
2 hard top bench seat deluxe, 2 bench seat Micros, 1 walk through Micro, 1
walk through Kombi, 2 westies, 2 double cab PU's, and one single cab PU
split window busses along with 2 bay window westies and 10 standard bay
windows at busses by the barn.  I really feel sorry for those of you city
bound people who can't fill their yards with steel buildings full of busses
and feel the good VW karma all around you!!
