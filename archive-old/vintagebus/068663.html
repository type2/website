It has all the ear marks of a compressor. They probably keep it in the bug to
use the bell housing and starter motor. From the high current electrical part
it looks more like a Sterling cycle motor to charge something, maybe a bank of
batteries for electric drive? The distributor looks like a magneto or adapted
sling generator, I noticed that there is no fan belt nor anything for a fan
belt to drive. Definitely would like to hear the history on it, just for the
general interest.

&gt; Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt; figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but
why
&gt; would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get. Look
&gt; at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be a
&gt; dummy, lots of wires etc.
