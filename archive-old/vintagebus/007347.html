&gt;&gt; It's always better to see a drivable LOW bus than a stock height bus
sitting
&gt;&gt; in a junkyard. At least it's still on the road.
&gt;I dunno - you can mack parts of the one in the junkyard...
&gt;
You're assuming it won't be crushed before you get there.  ;(

&gt;
Yeah; I want someone to junk a '54 deluxe so I can go down to pick-n-pull
and fill in some gaps on my bus...
&gt;
All the junkyards in your area have orders to call me at 1-800-SAVEABUS
(try it!) if any pre-63 Buses show up.  Good Luck!  :)

&quot;115 degrees?  That's perfect daily driver weather for my '55 Kombi!&quot;
