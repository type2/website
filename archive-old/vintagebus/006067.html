Hey List...

I've been happily driving my DC since I bought it.  Haven't touched the Z
since, and I think I'll be able to sell it without too much heartache.

I've got one of those vague questions about engine sounds.  I've adjusted
valves (they was loose), changed oil twice (found some sediment &quot;rocks&quot; in
the strainer, but was able to blow them apart and out with compressed air),
adjusted timing, new points, plugs, etc, cleaned the air cleaner, and
checked tranny goo.

My engine makes noise.  I'm sure that yours does too, but I have as yet been
unable to discern whether mine is &quot;happy&quot; noise or &quot;not so happy&quot; noise.
The thing runs real cool, if the dipstick/spit tests are any real
indication, and after it warms up in the a.m., I never feel the &quot;change&quot;
that indicates to me overheating.

The noises I hear (especially through the undampened heater tubes) are the
general churning sound of &quot;normal&quot; operation, a higher-pitched &quot;tiddely
tiddely&quot; that I attribute to the valves and rockers, and occasional &quot;other&quot;
noises.  This is where I get to the vague bit.  I've done the accellerate up
a hill and then let off thing to listen for rod knocks, and I never really
knew what piston slap sounds like.  One thing I do know, is that these
sounds have been this way for hundreds of miles, and that if they were
immediately nasty, they'd be worse by now.  I guess I'm just paranoid.  I
really want to build a nice, perfectly balanced mild engine with all Gene
Berg parts that I can trust forever.....but until then, does anybody have
any over-the-wire diagnostics you can recommend for me to try and determine
the real condition of my engine?  Otherwise, power is good and steady,
mileage is about 20mpg (mixed average with early 60 tranny and redux boxes
and 15&quot; tyres).  I was thinking of making a few recordings of the engine in
various states of running and put it on CD....anyone curious?  Send
snailmail info if so...

And now for the cold carb part:  In the morning, when it is really cold and
damp out there, Bartholomew doesn't like to run smooth or to accelerate
until he's fully warmed up.  I've read the carb icing posts with great
interest.....would just wrapping some of that bubble foil aluminum
insulation around the manifold help?  And I have a stock air cleaner with no
recirc. inlet.  Is there a way (I do have the breather riser, but it is
capped with one of those little filter things) to get warm air into my
intake?

TIA,
