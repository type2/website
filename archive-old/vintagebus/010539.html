Subject: Fabric from 71 Westfalia for 66 SO42

Still haven't brought the 66 Westfalia home yet but looked at it again and
have determined the interior is complete! Have tags and registration! It is
a walk through, the only thing that appears to be missing is what the online
manual says is a jump seat, which I am assuming is the AKA four leggged
stool, because it has the passenger camper seat behind the drivers seat.
The fabric in the 66 is rough.  Any recommeded cleaners to use to get the
grime off.  I have located a 71 that has pretty good fabric to replace with
if neccassary also I have an extra 75 4 legged stool, can I recover and feel
as though it is legitimate.  Am I right on assuming this is the same fabric,
looks like the same carmel (baby poop) pleather!  Additionally the 71 has
the old style hub caps a little rusty.  Should I get for the 66 and what is
good to remove the rust with.  Anyone looking for 68-71 camping stuff in the
DC we could team up for some removal and share some costs.  It has all
cabinets and sink/cooler.  Also I was wrong in my original post staing the
66 had a sink/cooler it has a cooler/water tank. I can't wait until Saturday
morning and I am sure you will be hearing alot from me!

Thanks for any help,
