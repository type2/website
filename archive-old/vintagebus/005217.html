Hi everybody,

Just a friendly reminder that the 1st annual Type2_dot_camp is coming up soon.
It will be held at Hagan-Stone Park just south of Greensboro, NC on April
16,17,18. We have reserved 30 sites in one of the RV loops. It is starting
to look like those are gonna fill up fast so we are prepared for an
overflow! There are lots more sites in the same loop and another 50 or so in
the adjacent RV and tent loops.

This is a great opportunity to meet fellow listmembers and enjoy the
wonderment that is the VW bus.

Friday, come early and get a good spot! Sites are $12.00 per night including
hookups and hot showers! Bring a musical instrument if you have one cause
the will be some type of jug music thing happening if DaveM has any say :)


Saturday afternoon, Kelly Brown (aka Metwiz ) has invited us to come by his
shop and see the metal work that he has been doing on the 57 23win,
NCbusguy's 58 hardtop deluxe, Rob's 60 WESTY and whatever else he has
stuffed in there. I am sure his neighbors will get a kick out of a caravan
of buses lining the street :)&gt;

Saturday night we will have some form of bonfire and door prizes.

Sunday will be the IVWA swap, show and drags in Farmington, NC. if you are
into that there will be a caravan. $12.00 per person at the gate.

1 Adam 12, see the website at
www.mindspring_dot_com/~vw69bus/everybus/everybus.html there are maps as well as
more info!!!


See you there!!!!!!!!
