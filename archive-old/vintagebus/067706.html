Welcome to the list!  I don't know of any shops that can do the work,
thought there may be a shop in SantaCruz that can. I don't recall the
name, but it was highly regarded. Try looking it up in a SantaCruz yellow
pages, or online in same.

regards,
cal

&gt; Warm greetings to all. Im glad to have found such a resource. I have a 64

&gt; where I can get a 21 window headliner installed correctly. I am half tempted
&gt; to have the total restoration handled by a shop - if there is a shop
&gt; thorough enough.... anyone?
