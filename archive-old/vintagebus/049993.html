Subject: Re: Pandora Update or What is That Thing? I need advice.

Ken Hooper lacked coherence and understanding:

&gt;I don't know enough about splits to know
&gt;whether this is a crucial problem. The big U-shaped transmission support is
&gt;present, but aft of that there was --something-- else, held on with two
&gt;big-ass bolts which were not touched.

I got under Joe's bus tonight and while I don't know the exact name for
these things, the big welded-in U-shaped cradle thing is there. What was
cut was the bolt-on part, probably called transmission mount? Not a big
problem. That particular thing I mean. Joe sez he even has a spare laying
around somewhere.

I just wanted to clarify that in case this thing ends up back on the
market: the entire driveline has been removed but if parts are obtained in
can all be bolted back in, it does not require measuring and welding and
sorcery.
