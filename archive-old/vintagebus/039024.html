&gt;I can get Gabriels for 12 bucks each KBYs and German oil filled for 
&gt;about 27.00 Each my question is how much do the Gabriel's suck?

I bought a set of Monroe shocks (probably the same as the Gabriels -
certainly the same price) for my 73 Westy and about 1 year later they were
no better than the 20 year old originals I had on there before.  I put KYB's
on about 3 years ago (40,000 miles) and they still feel just like they did
when new (which is MUCH firmer and more stable than the Monroes were when
they were new).  IMHO ya gets what ya pays for.
