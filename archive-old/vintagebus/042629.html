resto freak answer:
the chemical is much more likely to get into nooks and crannies and remove
rust where blasting or a wire wheel cannot reach.

the real answer:
i am lazy and if i can get rid of the rust by spraying on/off a liquid as
opposed to grinding all day and taking even more skin off my
knuckles/sandblasting and having sand in my boxers for a week and making a

is still there.
