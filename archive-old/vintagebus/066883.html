&gt;First of all, thanks to all that replied to my subaru electrical question
&gt;yesterday.

http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebuscharter.html

&gt;Checked fuses, and my fusible link was cooked.  I made a new one with some
&gt;leftover wire and a couple crimp connectors,

Plain wire is not a good replacement for a fusible link.

&gt;Next, what kind of protection against reversed polarities do our busses
&gt;have?  If this scenario would have played out with the bus, would I be
&gt;looking at a new wiring harness, or possibly worse?

Basically, the more complicated they get, the more things might fry.
An earlier Bus with no radio and electromechanical voltage regulator
probably wouldn't care much, although you might have to re-polarize
the generator afterwards.
