Subject: cranky truck

Well I got all three transmission mounts changed out and installed the
0-mile Mexican motor I had laying around. I wanted to install the flaps I
had but I don't have a working thermostat and I didn't realize that I would
have to tap a hole for the thermostat bracket stud. Dang, I'll have to do it
later. So I made use of the NOS bus muffler I had been hoarding and I bolted
up the Thing skid plate to the underside of the motor. I used a crankstart
nut to attach the belt pulley and cut a small hole in the tin just big
enough for the crank end to pass through. Bolted up the crank start apron I
found half buried in the Georgia mountains, replaced the rear gate and
clutch tube, now its ready to start. Started it with the key the first time,
I must say this type 3 auto starter kicks but. Then I successfully started
by hand 3 time in a row. I cant wait to freak out all the people at work,
They think I am nuts enough driving a VW truck.
