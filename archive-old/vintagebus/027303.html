Subject: Empi five spokes?

I don't know how you guys did it. The 67 I can understand because of the
fender lip going out. I picked up a set of five spokes a few years back
and took them over to our Les Schwab to get some treads for them. We
tried 3 different 165 series tires on the back and nothing would clear.
I would really like to run some BRM's on my 60 Crew Cab. If anyone can
tell how this would be possible with the stock tranny and reduction
boxes I would thoroughly grateful.
