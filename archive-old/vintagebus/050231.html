Volks-

Many thanks for all the suggestions on fixing the low rpm hesitation in my
bus!  This morning, I dug a derelict vacuum advance dizzy out of the parts
box, tuned it up with new parts, and installed it.

Amazing difference!  No hesitation at all!!!  I never would have suspected
the 009!  (Neither did the guys at the repair shop, having changed the carb
out twice chasing this problem!).  I guess the 009 will make a nice
paperweight!  Like many others, I simply assumed that since &quot;everybody&quot;
seemed to be using the 009 setup, it must be the way to go.  So much for
conventional wisdom!

No disrespect meant to the volks who sent info on how to fix the 009/34PICT
arrangement.  Intuitively, one would think it should work, or there must be
a way to make it work.  In this case, I just wasn't up for pulling the
carb, plugging holes and rejetting it.

Two other interesting notes:

First, I thought initially I would put a new vacuum advance dizzy in vice
the very well used one I found in my parts box.  However, the guy at Vee
Parts (one of the better local parts stores) insisted that I must be out of
my mind, and that there couldn't possibly be anything wrong with the 009.
I would have had to hold a gun to his head to get him to order one for me.
Also the new vacuum dizzy would cost at least $200!

Second, in the course of doing the R&amp;R on the dizzy, I discovered that the
repair shop had installed the rebuilt carb with two of the float bowl
screws backed out about 1/4&quot;, and the with the aircleaner just sitting on
on the carb.  gas was dripping down the manifold.  Also, the tuneup I paid
for evidently didn't include a new dizzy cap or rotor!  If anybody in the
San Diego area wants to know who did the work, p-mail me.

Thanks again for the many suggestions!
