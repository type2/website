Good afternoon fellow transporter friends,
Just thought id share a quick fix that i came up with yesterday. Well the
right hinge had been seperated for years on my bus and the other day i had a
short in the lights and it made the bus stop, so when i pulled over to fix
it, the first thing i did was check the batery connections, and the lid came
off in my hands, well i had mastered the one hinge prop, but this was two
much. So i called a few bus part places and it looked like it was gonna be
around $50 for the new pair of hinges, i asked if anyone knew a quick fix,
no one had a clue.  Seems like the bus restoration becomes an addiction and
some of the experts have forgotton the survival skills. Anyway, so heres
what i did, i took the hinges of both the door and the bus, having only a
regular handheld drill, i took a 3/32 bit(i just grabbed the one that looked
about right) and drilled holes in both sides of both hinges. I use 2 pieces
of 2by4 nailed together with the hinge piece in one end to hold it still,
and then took a &quot;8d common nail &quot;  and popped it in there with a hammer, the
holes were no exactly straight, so when the nail went in it went in very
firmly, then i cut the head off a nother nail and super glued it in the
other side for symmetry.   The result was a very functional hinge that
actually looks like it was made that way after a little paint.   Well sounds
easy right, but i highly suggest that you try to undo the hinge screws that
attach to the body first before you start the project, because you might
need new screws, if they are rusted shut beyond hope, you can drill them
out, and if you are lucky you wont need a tap to repair the hole. Well
anyway for all the times that i was slapped in the head by this deck lid, i
felt compelled to share my solution.
