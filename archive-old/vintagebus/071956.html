&gt; The &quot;mirror&quot; part is loose on the base where you adjust it. I turn it

HI Rex,
That seems to be an interior mirror.  The only way to fix it is to 
dissassemble it.  The hard part of this is taking your time carefully prying 
one tiny area at a time of the aluminum of the mirror head away from the 
glass without prying against the glass which would chip or outright break it.
Once apart you can see what is broken and possibly repair it and while it is 
apart have it rechromed.
