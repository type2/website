Volks-

The bad news is that due to an upcoming move to the other side of town, and
due to having expanded my wife's sense of humor envelope about as far as it
would go, I had to part with one of my stable of busses.

The good news is that Tim, another San Diego listee bought my 67 Westy and
drove it home last night.  Tim had recently suffered the loss of his 71
camper (totalled when hit by a reckless teenager), and correctly decided
that a splitty camper was the way to go.

Good luck to Tim!
