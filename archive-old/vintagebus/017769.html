Hi Arron

Sounds like a vacuum leak, stuck choke
or a sticking valve.
Get a fire extinguisher handy, attach a tachometer 
to the distributor (or tune up your ear)
With the engine running at idle and not warmed up;
spray carb cleaner at manifold to head
and manifold to carb joints as well as any vacuum lines.
Does the rpm pick up? Then you have a leak.

fix it

Spray around the choke pivot inside and out.
You may consider disabling the choke 
all together if you live in a tropical / desert area
(look up &quot;Carburetor procedure&quot; and under  &quot;about chokes&quot;
in the idiot book for a simple explanation of this)

Still nothing solid?

Engine still running? OK
Pull a plug wire at the cap with a insulated tool
and note any change in rpm.
Do this one at a time for all four cylinders.
the cylinder that results in the least rpm drop is 
doing the least amount of work and may have
stuck  or sticking valve.

get a vacuum gauge 

$ cheap tool $

and refer to my notes at

Berymen's chemtool carb cleaner is the best for the above check

&gt; Well, my hesitation/missing problem appears not to be carb icing as 
&gt; far as
&gt; I can tell. The next question is, what is the problem? Here are the
&gt; details:
&gt; 
&gt; New 1600 SP (~700 miles on engine)
&gt; Solex 30 PICT-2 carb
&gt; Doghouse cooler/shroud/fan
&gt; Preheat tube connected
&gt; stock oil bath air cleaner
&gt; stock exhaust/heater boxes
&gt; all tin sealed
&gt; thermostat connected and functioning
&gt; timing 10 deg. btdc _at_ idle
&gt;        30 deg. btdc _at_ full advance
&gt; new cap, rotor, plugs, plug wires
&gt; pertronix points replacement
&gt; voltage _at_ coil+ looks good (~13v _at_ idle, ~14.5 _at_ &gt;1200 rpm)
&gt; 
&gt; Symptoms:
&gt; 
&gt; Bus runs horrible until engine warms up. Once it has been driven 
&gt; 10-15
&gt; minutes, runs great. Before warmed up misses/hesitates when under 
&gt; any
&gt; load. Can be driven if you really keep your foot out of it, but this 
&gt; is
&gt; difficult as &quot;keeping your foot out of it&quot; implies barely enough 
&gt; power to
&gt; accelerate at all when upshifting. Mostly a problem at lower rpm 
&gt; ranges,
&gt; right after an upshift. Once warmed up, runs like a champ. Never
&gt; misses/hesitates.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any ideas? Good things to check? I'm pretty much at my 
&gt; wits 
&gt; end...
