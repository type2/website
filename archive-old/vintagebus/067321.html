To all,

Everybus was started 5 years ago as an annual event to fill a hole in
the VW camping schedule. EB quickly took on a life of its own and
grew into one the larger East coast events.

EB02 was attended by over 160 buses which stressed the limits of the
facility and the organizers. In the fall of 2002 I spoke with the
park manager about hosting the event for the 5th time in 2003. The
park manager agreed but noted that some of the issues that at EB02
would need work for the proposed EB03.

A short list of park management concerns includes
-Kids running around the park unattended after quiet hours.
-Vehicles driving way too fast through the park.
-Unabashed and conspicuous consumption of alcohol resulting in the
infamous &quot;red cup campaign.&quot;
-Dogs running loose and pooping EVERYWHERE. This was a particular
concern not only for the safety and convenience of park guests but
for the wild peacocks that roam the nature preserve.
-Noise after quiet hours.
-People who were not registered campers dropping in and hanging out
like it was a car show.
-Overwhelmed septic system. Porta-Johns will have to be provided at
the expense of the event planners if EB returns.

Having said all of that, there seems to still be enough interest from
the VW Transporter family to make a go of it. If you are interested
in attending EveryBus 03 please visit the web site for details.
