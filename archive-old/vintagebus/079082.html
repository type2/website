Subject: Diminished list activity

It may be true that activity on the list is not as great as it once was. BUT,
I'll bet there is a lot of folks like me who hide quietly in the bushes, while
soaking up the accumulated knowledge and experience of  Matt Roberds, ronnie,
VeeWee, Clara and many, many others.

Sure, there's an occasional stupid question or comment, but I, for one,hope
that doesn't slow anybody down.

Keep it coming, everyone!
