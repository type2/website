&gt; Need to install a temp gauge. Is the oil press. relief a likely spot for the

Hi Newbie,
Anyplace on the underside of the engine will be exposed to wire damage and 
uneven oil temp due to more cooling due to air, lower oil area (Remember heat 
rises!) and even water sprayed up by the wheels.  Also the pressure relief 
piston and the sump area are definitely out of the way of the oil flow being 
pumped through the engine.  Best to use a dipstick sender or as we do the 
idiot light area with a X-fitting so we can have the idiot light, temp, &amp; 
pressure all at one place.  Probably the best place would be in the plug that 
blocks off the passage drilling for the sump pipe in the right rear lower of 
the engine case, but would require carefull attention not to restrict flow 
there.  Which would mean drilling part of this passage larger to allow oil to 
pass around the sender with no problem.  Do also install a pressure gauge 
since that will show things that the temp never will so tends to show 2/3 of 
what is going on in the engine compared to about the 1/3 a temp guage shows.
