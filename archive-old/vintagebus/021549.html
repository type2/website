hey, just wanted to write a short post- just got back from Jerome Jamboree.
It was a really groovy scene, lots of old buses and bus people camping out, a
small swap, and lotsa nifty raffle prizes, it was hot, but not too hot, and a
beautiful venue.  Lotsa wedriveem type buses, not a lot of shiny type
volksies.  Met a bunch of listees, which was also cool.  Four barndoors were
there, including Everett's 55, which won a prize  :).  Joe and Margaret, some
friends from Oly, won the jerry Jess award for their typeIV baywindow camper,
which the cool murals and stickers on it.    A splendid time was had by all.
Nice drive there and back, but HOT!   Needles, Ca is a pit.   A
long,boring,sucky trip report may follow soon.
