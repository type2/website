Subject: RE: Stripping &amp; Archeology

When I did my bus, I used POR15 to do the paint removal.  It worked very
well for going all the way to the metal.  I could have never just taken
off one layer with the remover.  It was an all or nothing job.

And it was a long job.  To get all the paint off takes a bit of prep
work.  And when it is stripped, then you have to treat it with some type
of etching solution, like a zinc phosporus coating, or it will rust
overnight.
