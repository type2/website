&gt; er- the dash was the bottom colour April 61 when my 61 was made.   The change
&gt; was made in late 61/early 62 sometime.   Anyone with later 61s or early 62s
&gt; want to comment on their dash colour being the top or bottom colour?

The dash on my 61 westy is mango green.  Did they ever do an entire bus in Mango
green?  I don't remember my M-codes so I can't tell you if it is early or late.
But the dash is definetely the bottom color.

Thanks,
Aaron
