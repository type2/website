Ronnie,

Just how close does one have to get to properly be pulled in by the draft?  And
when drafting, how do you keep an eye out for the CHP?

(in context of everything, that question as written, is what I meant.   Not
trying to make sophomoric jokes about drafting and hugging A#s)

Thanks,

Scott
