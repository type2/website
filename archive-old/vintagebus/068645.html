Boy, aren't you lucky. I was just going through a compilation book called &quot;All
About VW Performance Engines&quot; put out by Hot VW in 1989. It contains articles
on heads and carbs, blocks and cams, the Ripper two liter, and all sorts of
performance charts for various bolt ons for the 1600. Good read still today.

I've been combing through my past articles in HotVW's, and VWT, but I cannot
find what I'm looking for.  I have been a long time single port fan, but I
believe it was HotVW's that did a dyno test with Single Port heads vs. Dual
Port heads, and the Dual Port out performed the Single Port in every
possible test.  This was even with &quot;working&quot; a set of single port to try and
get them to flow better.  If I find the article I will try to post the
findings.

Later
