Hello

Is this a safe set up (6v starter, getting 12 v) ?
What if the engine is having a bit of problem starting, and the 6v starter
has to run ex. 10-15 seconds ?

You don't know the pleasures of starting a VW engine until
you do it with a 6V starter running at 12V. I have used this
set up for over 25 years with great results. I also use a
capacitive discharge ignition. It takes 1 second or less of
