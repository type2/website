Bottom line - GEX sends out product that is marginal at best.  When you mass
produce engines on the level they do, quality control is next to nil.  I got
a set of heads from them that were so far gone, they needed rebuilding.
Don't get me wrong, the heads were within spec but not NEW (as they should
be when building a new engine.)  There have been numerous reports of engines
throwing rods, over heating, etc.  Oh yeah, they'll take it back but you're
out a wad for the shipping...
