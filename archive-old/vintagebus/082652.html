&gt;The sending unit for the fuel gauge on my son's '69 bus stopped working.
&gt;After checking fuses, we are trying to determine how to remove the unit.

Before you bust out the saws and drills and implements of destruction...
the power for the gas gauge on a '69 doesn't go through a fuse.  It
comes directly from the ignition switch.  If the turn signal indicator
lights and oil and generator lights in the dash are working, then the
fuel gauge _probably_ has juice.  But it couldn't hurt to pull out the
instrument panel and inspect for a loose wire on the back of the fuel
gauge.

There is a troubleshooting procedure on page 4-38 of the bay-window
Bentley.  That procedure, with some additions, is basically: if the
gauge is stuck at full, unplug the in-line connector in the brown fuel
sender wire near the tank.  If the gauge moves down off of full, the
sender is screwed up.  If it doesn't move down, take the instrument
cluster out and take the brown wire off the fuel gauge.  If it still
doesn't move down, the gauge is screwed up.  If it moves down, the
wire between the gauge and the in-line connector is grounded.

If the gauge doesn't register at all, unplug the in-line connector
and ground the gauge side of that connector to a good ground.  The
gauge should go to 1/1.  If it does, the sender is probably screwed
up.  If it doesn't, take the instrument cluster out and take the
brown wire off the fuel gauge.  Jump the terminal that the brown
wire was on to a good ground and check it again.  If it goes to 1/1,
the wire between the gauge and the in-line connector is open.  If
it doesn't, the gauge is screwed up.

You may have done all this stuff already.  I just wanted to mention
the various possibilities.
