ahhhh, the journey begins!!!!

There are two small screws (four total) on the sides of the frames... dig
around in the 7 layers (my guess) of paint... you'll find them.  Remove the
screws and carefully spread the frames apart (sideways).  (I'm assuming the
frames are out of the bus already)

How does the glass come out of the Frames, from the Popout Windows?  I got
my 66 towed here today and was trying to figure out how to get the glass out
of the frames.  Obviously I'm not seeing something, cause I can't figure it
out.
