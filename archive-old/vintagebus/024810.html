Its FRIDAY SO&gt;&gt;&gt; HERES A FRIDAY POST

Should I Trade my Early westy for a split beetle?? READ ON&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

My buddy recently picked up a `51 split beetle from CT.  Very..extremely
clean and rust free car...only 2 owners and it has 52,000 original
miles.  It is a Standard split...very plain Jane.  It has its original
motor 25 hp runs and drives.  Needs some very expensive pieces to make
it complete..ribbed semaphores...some engine pieces...seats and
interior  stuff, new tires ect..It has sat for 30 years without any real
attention so its gonna need a thorough going over involving lots of
cash...it is pretty ugly with a bad re-paint...but again is one of the
most rust free split beetles I have ever seen.

ANYWAYS (and here is the bus content) he wants to trade me for my `61
Westfalia driver..nice bus, has had some rust repair done...could use
paint...but is 100% complete, all Original interior, the tent, rack, and
some of the cleanest orig. VW Safaris next to nos ones...the bus also
has a brand spankin' new rebuilt 1600 sp...new everything...I drive this
baby daily in the non-salt months....she is realllyy fun and I love her
quite a bit.  But....??

He wants to trade me even up...what do you guys think I should do...BTW
I do have another `60 Westy in even better shape then the one for
trade...so that kinda eases the pains...what cha think guys?

Todd
