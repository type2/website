Subject: NQ, CA Passengers in Pickup Bed Code Section

I knew the Lieutenant would come through for me on this one, here is the relevant
code section about hanging out in a pickup bed while driving.

This is in reference to NQs upcoming CA trip and his tanning salon set up in the
back of the SC.  Hopefully, he'll have that midwest pall gone by the time he gets
to the CA border.  Then again, he may have that cooked lobster look doing real
nice by then and need the break from the sun. ;-))
