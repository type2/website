I think that we should expose the person that sold this bus to your customer
on the type 2 list for everyone to know about.  I also was ripped off by
someone on my '56.  I have found that spreading the word has worked very well.
The individual has tried to &quot;sell&quot; other vehicles to friends of mine.  They
flat refused to do business with or help this person to market citing past
reputation for unloading &quot;garbage.&quot;  

Recently, this person called a good friend of mine who is well respected in
the bus world asking for assistance in selling a bus.  He told him in a nice
way that he was aware of his past business dealings and could not recommend
him in good faith.  It really makes the person doing business in this way to
feel uneasy because they believe that everyone in the hobby does not trust
them.  This is the best form of revenge that I could have hoped for. I have
seen people completely disappear from a hobby as a result of doing this.

So, the moral of the story is:  Expose the people that rip you off.  You are
not helping your friends by keeping it quiet.  Sooner or later, that person
will rip your friends off as well.
