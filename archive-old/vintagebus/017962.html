with these carb questions currently up, re:idling i have a question.

I have a 28 pict 1 solex carb(i think that is the designation) Anyway...how
sensitive should the idle screw on the side of it be? When I turn it seems
like i have to turn it a couple times before i get a repsonse. I had the bus
in storage for 6 months (dec to may) this year. I used gas stabilier, but i am
wondering if the carb could be gummed up due to the lack of response from the
idle screw....any suggestions..
