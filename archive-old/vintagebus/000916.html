Steve wrote:  What about diatomaceous earth? The stuff you use in older pool
filters. It is basically fossilized plankton that has been mined from some
ancient sea bed I think. Its about the same consistency as baking soda.

Diatomaceous earth is a very fine material used in allot of products we use
(toothpaste, filtering beer, making tires, the list goes on) but with my
experience in working around this material there are safety hazards
breathing Diatoms. It is like coral that can be inhaled and it is razor
sharp in your lungs and it doesn't come out which causes all kinds of
problems. I would go the Baking Soda route that is just my two cents.

Sitting back once again and watching the traffic go by!
