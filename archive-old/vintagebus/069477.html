Subject: FS VW Engine test and run in stand

I've finished building my five Type IV air cooled engines and got them
all run in to my satisfaction.
Time to take a break.
Engine test stand for sale, knocks down to 8&quot; x 8&quot; x 48&quot; Carton weighing
145 pounds.
It must ship by motor freight or I can split the boxes to ship by UPS.
Ship from Dallas, TX 75220
This stand is set up for Type IV air cooled but a WB will mount without
modifications. You'll just need a big plastic drum to process your
coolant on WBs.
Comes with remote start and monitoring center mounted in a tackle box.
The control center has a 4,000 RPM VDO tach that has an hour meter that
will work on point set or electronic ignition. (Tach will work on W
terminal of Diesel Alternator, 2.4,6,8 Cyl).
It has oil temp and sender, oil pressure and sender, cylinder head temp
no sender, manifold vacuume gauge, clock. All instruments are VDO. It has
a remote starter switch and fuel pump power switch. Comes with an AGC
electric fuel pump suitable for carburated engines.
This stand rolls around on 4 casters rated at 200 pounds each.
Fully assembled it makes up to 48&quot; x 48&quot; and 30&quot; in height.
Construction is 1&quot; x 2&quot; heavy channel steel, painted white.
It should be suitable for engines up to 400 pounds and 150 hp.
Asking price $400.00 complete.
Pictures will be sent to those with a serious interest.
Buy it, use it, sell it. Well worth the price.

Stan Wilder
