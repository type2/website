thanks to all on the list who have ordered and inquired about
sheet metal, the first order has been delayed a couple of days
due to the many add-on's that i have done to get what you all
want asap, the first shippment is due to arrive 10 days from monday
gave myself a couple of extra days in case of problems ( customs)
