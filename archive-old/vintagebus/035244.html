Would anyone know where to find step by step directions (online) on how to

disasemble the front and rear drum brakes? Also, I am thinking about doing a

disc brake conversion in the front, I know this would require stronger brake

lines a dual flow master cylinder and other things. Who makes the best

conversion kit at the best price? 


Thanks

sounds like you should use a combination of the idiot book and the bentley.

no disc brakes do not require stronger lines
