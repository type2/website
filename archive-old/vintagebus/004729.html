I've wired up the fuel gauge sender properly now.. ie wire to the front of
bus is conected to the terminal in the middle of sender... and i've earthed
one of the mounting screws...

Today tho..i've noticed as well as it having the number 12 in blue ink on
the back of the sender - me thinking this was 12V - but underneath a square
&quot;thingy&quot;  there is 6V stamped on the housing.

so bang goes that idea... unless someone can suggest a way of making it work
on my 12 volt system... '60 bus.. 12 volt lectrics.

also.... can someone tell me what the &quot;thingy&quot; is... small oblong thing with
2 terminals attatched to the rear of the fuel gauge.
one of the terminals is conneted straight to the &quot;+&quot;  terminal on the
gauge... the other i take it is where live feed goes... from the ignition
switch.?
the last terminal &quot;G&quot; heads off to the wire running to the back of the bus..
sender.
but nothing goes!
only if i earth the G terminal to the body do i get reaction.. but this just
goes to the top of the scale.. half tank/full tank- reads the same.

also... how any info about how the sender works would help a lot..

as i see it... the wire from the gauge G terminal is an earth of sorts...
the other end fits the sender terminal... which is connected to a bar
running down the tube inside the tank... the float moves up/down another
wire which is connected to the body of the sender.. the body of sender
connects to the bus... so as the float reaches different possitions on the
wire the resistance changes. ... am i right? :)

but, i've connected a bulb from the earth wire (on sender) to 1.5 volt
battery and tried to make light come on by connecting another wire from bulb
to sender terminal.. but no shine. :(

should there be?

heeellllpp!

i'm getting headaches

should my little test with light show the sender to be bust?... or am i off
track completely?

i've looked at most of the wiring diags on thom's site and none (i've seen)
show this little &quot;thingy&quot;
