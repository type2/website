&gt;Why not utilize radiant underfloor heating powered by a propane 
&gt;burner/boiler and the state-of-the-art tubing provided by many
&gt;companies for home and industrial use?

Isn't radiant heating usually installed in a concrete floor?  I
would think the concrete would tend to even out the heat.
Without some method to even out the heat, I think you'd get
&quot;hot spots&quot; over the tubing on the floor.

A car is not the best environment for flexible tubing with joints 
in it, either.  A house A/C will often have its original refrigerant
charge 30 years later; put a similar A/C system in a car, with
vibration rattling the joints, and 7 to 10 years later, the system
is one big leak.

You'd have to protect the tubing from road debris, maybe by using
a &quot;belly pan&quot; such as is found on double-door Buses.

You'd want to insulate the brake line that runs from front to rear
a little bit, to keep it from getting *too* hot.

If radiant systems use pressurized water circulated by a pump,
it would work OK.  If they are more like the old radiator systems,
they may not like not being level, as will happen often in a
moving vehicle.

&gt;however, how much energy would be consumed to heat a (presumably)
&gt;well-insulated bus interior?

If it was well-insulated, even the stock system would do better...

Let's follow along on a physics adventure...

Assumptions:
 perfect heat transfer to the air inside the Bus
 no heat is lost to the sheet metal, outside, etc.
 we are just heating the back of the bus (I estimate that
   heating the whole bus would add 1 to 2 luggage compartments
   to these figures - about a 15% to 30% increase)
 no seats, luggage, equipment, etc in the back of the Bus

VW = Volkswagen Transporter Instruction Manual, August 1963 Edition
Bosch = Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th edition

Load space + luggage compartment (over the engine) = 
4.8 m^3 + 0.8 m^3 (VW) =
5.6 m^3

Density of air at 0 C = 1.293 kg/m^3 (Bosch)

Mass of air in a Bus = 5.6 m^3 * 1.293 kg/m^3 = 7.2 kg

Specific heat of air, constant volume: 0.716 kJ/(kg * K) (Bosch)

Say we want to heat the air from -18 C (0 F) to a toasty 25 C (77 F).
25 C - -18 C =
43 C =
43 K

The energy needed is

43 K * 7.2 kg * 0.716 kJ/(kg * K) = 220 kJ

To put this in perspective...

1 kWh = 3.6e6 J = 3.6e3 kJ  (Bosch)

220 kJ / 3.6e3 kJ/kWh = 0.062 kWh
( ie: a perfect 62 watt electric heater running for one hour, 
  or a perfect 1200 watt electric heater running for 3.1 minutes )

1 Btu = 1055.06 J = 1.05506 kJ  (Bosch)

220 kJ / 1.05506 kJ/Btu = 210 Btu

Specific calorific value of propane: 46.3 MJ/kg = 46300 kJ/kg (Bosch)

220 kJ / 46300 kJ/kg = 0.0048 kg propane ( 0.011 lb or 0.17 oz )

Specific calorific value of gasoline: 42.7 MJ/kg = 42700 kJ/kg (Bosch)
  
220 kJ / 42700 kJ/kg = 0.0052 kg gasoline ( about 0.007 L or about 0.25 oz )

This is pretty good.  Heating up air is easy.  Now let's throw a 
wrinkle into it...

Let's assume that you wanted to heat the walls of the Bus, too.
Assume one layer of sheet metal, 1 mm thick, is to be heated.
Assume no windows, as this calculation is pretty far out already.  :)

Load space length, width, height = 2.7 m, 1.5 m, 1.35 m (VW)
Sides = 2 * 1.35 m * 2.7 m * 0.001 m = 0.00729 m^3    
Top/bottom = 2 * 1.5 m * 2.7 m * 0.001 m = 0.00810 m^3

Luggage length, width, height = 0.7 m, 1.45 m, 0.8 m (VW)
Sides = 2 * 0.8 m * 0.7 m * 0.001 m = 0.00112 m^3
Top/bottom = 2 * 1.45 m * 0.7 m * 0.001 m = 0.00203 m^3

Total sheet metal = 0.0185 m^3

Density of unalloyed steel = 7.9 g/cm^3 = 7900 kg/m^3 (Bosch)

Mass of sheet metal = 0.0185 m^3 * 7900 kg/m^3 = 146 kg

Mean specific heat of unalloyed steel =  0.49 kJ/(kg * K)  (Bosch)

The energy needed (for just the sheet metal) is...

43 K * 146 kg * 0.49 kJ/(kg * K) = 3090 kJ

The &quot;perspective&quot; numbers are 0.857 kWh and 2920 Btu.  Fuel requirement
is 0.067 kg propane (0.15 lb) or 0.072 kg gasoline (0.098 L).  Heating
up sheet metal is not as easy as heating up air.

Now, add windows, and door seals that are 30 years old, and an overhead
vent that doesn't seal, and it takes...more energy.  :)

I wonder why I did all this math.
