 To the Friendly and Knowledgeable List Members,

 Long ago, I swapped for a core type III swing axle trans way back
intending to put it the larger backing plates in my '67 Bug. Because of
the scarcity of cheap 5 bolt (pre 66) drums the project got put off .
Now I'm wondering if I could rebuild this thing and install it in my
61Kombie. I've seen articles on this but they say to purchase the
magazine advertiser's kit. (read $$) Has any one done this swap with
stock parts?
I have a 1600 single port with a 30 Pct, 009. and stock exhaust and run
14&quot; rims . My top speed is 63 mph if I loose the reduction boxes what
happens?

Aloha

Ken

in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&quot;
