&lt;&lt; 2.&gt; Keep in mind that Blue Nelson's Dormobile was
 dumped on it's side while enroute to/from Alaska. It
 came back the next Summer to win first over my freshly
 completed 67 Westy at the June VWClassic meets three
 years in a row. I have three Second Place plaques due
 to his Dormie! You go!, Blue.
 {Point being is that the bus can still become a very
 nice show bus if that is you intention. Otherwise put
 it on four wheels and drive it.} Do it YOUR way! ;-)
 Tell everyone else to buzz off if they dont like it.
