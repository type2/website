Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum filler (was: bodywork question)

Hi,
The only big possible problem we could see about using an aluminuim filler 
against steel is that the two dissimular metals can easily start an 
electrical galvanic reaction like a battery.  This apparently is a big 
problem for Deloren owners who have to deal with corrosion problems of 
stainless steel held together with aluminium rivets.  Also new Crosley owners 
in the 1950s who had engines lock up within a year due to corrosion from 
multiple types of metals used in them.  Eric&amp;Barb
