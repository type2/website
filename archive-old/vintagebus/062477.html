Subject: Re: [VB] Bay window tank into splitty

I think the bay sender works fine.  If you use a splitty sender, it's shorter 
and only reads the top ten gallons of the tank, so if it says empty you won't 
know if you have 5 gallons left or only a quart left.  The 59 truck I had had 
a bay tank with a splitty sender in it, and I thought that the guage or 
sender was broken until I filled it up.

 Okay, I scored a very clean bay window gas tank at Sacto BOR, to put in my 
64 bus, and have seen the website that shows the filler neck mods to put it 
in, but as far as the gas gauge goes, do any of you know if the bay window 
sender will work with a splitty gauge?  I know the 6v splitty fuel stuff 
works with 12v just fine, but are the ohm's just way out of range on the 
'newer' sender to work with the older gauge?
 
 I was going to check with my ohmmeter when I got the tanks out, but thought 
maybe I could save some time if someone here knows for sure or not.
 
 Thanks for any help!
