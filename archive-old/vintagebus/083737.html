Subject: Re: [VB] Porsche Pulley 

Jake Raby tested it, and says it lowers head temps by
25 degrees on any shroud:

I tend to take what Jake Raby says pretty
seriously...here's the details on the level of testing
he was getting into:

&gt; I
&gt; haven't seen anyone do a true back to back test with
&gt; a stock pulley ratio
&gt; versus an increased ratio to see what difference it
&gt; actually made. &quot;It seems
&gt; to run cooler&quot; doesn't jive with me. If the numbers
&gt; aren't there, then they
&gt; aren't there. I want to see head temp figures
&gt; between the two before I
&gt; decide if it does anything or not.
