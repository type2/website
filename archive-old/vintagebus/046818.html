There was one on ebay a few months ago.
Didnt meet the guys 250$ reserve!!!!!
I was high bidder at 26$, he offered it to me at that price but I passed!
Didnt know people got so &quot;hot&quot; for these things!!!!!!

&lt;&lt;Hi Volks,
We are interested in a set of these.  If anyone has a set give us a holler.  
Since we are in the PNW they do not seem to show up here.  Probably more of a 
Southern item.   Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
