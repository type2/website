&lt;&lt; The old man who owned this before myself, actually lived in the bus

Hi Byran,
If that old man is around still check with him or if not check to see where 
he stayed.  Most likely he saved the sheet metal for use later.  Also you can 
write the factory with your chassi number and get a list of Mcodes for a 
price.   Eric&amp;Barb
