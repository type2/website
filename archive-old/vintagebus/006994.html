looks like the person out my way who just bought the COMPLETE original paint
and interior DD Micro for less then the reserve for the e-puck middle seat
got a hell of a deal and his middle seat is original Como Green, much nicer
then that brown, and he can drive his bus, I'd like to see someone try to
drive a $3000.00 seat around.
