Subject: Reprints of pre-'63 manuals

Hello all!

On the subject of manuals, specifically Bentley ones and the lack of
reprints thereof...From the Bentley Web site:

&quot;For questions about Bentley products, such as upcoming products, 
 vehicle coverage, product availability, or international shipping
 costs, please contact Customer Service at sales_at_bentleypublishers_dot_com
 or call toll free (800) 423-4595 between the hours of 9AM-5PM eastern
 time Monday-Friday.&quot;

Another part of their site lists 617-547-4170 as their phone number
if you are calling from outside North America.

Like most other companies they are in business to make money.  If
enough people write them and say, &quot;Look, I'd pay $YY.YY ($YYY.YY?) 
for a good, modern reprint of the 195x Bus manual, or $ZZ.ZZ for a
high-res scanned CD-ROM copy&quot;, they'll listen.  It might help to
have the leaders of some of the larger Bus groups/clubs call them
up as well.

I would say that the paper book is usually preferable to the CD-ROM, 
but on the other hand, it is probably cheaper for them to get a NOS
manual, scan it, and press CDs than it would be for them to re-photoset
the whole manual, especially for something with a more limited market.
Let's face it, they can probably sell more Audi A8 and BMW Z3 manuals
than they can old Bus manuals.  Anyway, getting the info in any form
is probably better than wandering around in the darkness.

Standard disclaimers, I don't work for them, etc.  Just something
to think about.
