I suspect I was dealing with a different bearing back there, but when
I last had this problem, I ended up using a combination of a propane
torch, and a soft-iron chisel (brick chisel, for those that care about
details).  The chisel was used to get between the bearing and what's
behind it, not to cut the bearing itself.  A small crowbar would
probably work better, since it's got more of a built-in fulcrum.
Thorough heating of the bearing is an important point, as well.  It
really helps to have a second person for all this (one hand on the
torch, one holding the chisel/crowbar, one hitting the chisel/crowbar
with a hammer, and one providing some leverage on the other side of
the bearing once it's move out a bit - kinda much for your average
individual person to do at once).
