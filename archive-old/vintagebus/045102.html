He may want the speaker brackets that come on deluxe and standard microbuses (above the corner windows)
Looks like he is doing a nice job.  Makes me wonder if he will pay 3k for the dual fold down middle seat that he needs to finish the bus.....

&lt;&lt; Yeah, but why hack the roof? just to put the corner windows in? weird.

&gt; You're right, that *is* weird!  It looks like he's converting a
double-door
&gt; kombi into a 15-window hardtop double-door deluxe.  Very odd...
