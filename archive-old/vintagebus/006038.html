Hope to meet all in Congress at 7:30 AM Fri morning, just depends on how far
I have to tow Ronnie or how long we have to wait for him to catch up to the
1776, DP single pict 34 thats in front of him that he's trying to draft off
of. The match race to Congress is on.

John ( single 34, dp heads and stock trans) Howard
