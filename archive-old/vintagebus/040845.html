Here's a subject I'm quite familiar with.  Spent years with my bus having
a broken gas gauge and busted odometer!  Gas can on top is best.  Here is
where I disagree.  With a plastic container, leave as LITTLE space as
possible for air.  The gas vapor above the fluid gas is what expands
when it gets warm not the liquid gas.  Leaving a small volume to be heated,
leaves less to expand.

Do not leave a vent open on the container, otherwise the gas will just
evaporate out, and you will always be smelling gas.  At about the hottest
time of day go up there and open the container to release the pressure.
Don't breathe the fumes.  This will assure that the expansion due to heat
will have already taken place, and that at any lower temperature, the
pressure will be lower.  It's kinda strange to see the same container in
the morning all caved in from to lower pressure due to lower temp.  Don't
open to vent, or at the hottest the pressure will be the highest.

Tie it down securely of course, and then cover the container with a
cardboard box to provide much needed shading, disguising the contents
while in the red light district, and to keep people from constantly
telling you that you have a gas can on the roof!   Tie the box down
with heavy visible ropes/whatever, or again people will tell you that
you have a box on top not tied down.  Some people just don't understand
that trunks are not for gas cans, but rather for dead bodies!

If the box is a little beat up, it will keep folks from thinking
something valuable is in there.

A low profile (not tall) container is better, short and fat is the
way to go.  Easier to prevent from falling over.

Here's a question for the road trippers...

I've got one of those plastic, 2 gallon gas cans that I'm gonna fill up and
keep with me on the way down to Solvang at the end of the month.  I'm
thinking that the roof rack will be the best place to carry it while full.
But should I worry about venting it at all since it's in the sun?
Danke!

The roof rack is the best place for it.  Don't worry about venting the
can, as they are made to be sealed at fairly high temps.  It isn't going
to get any hotter on your rack than it would in the back of a gardener's
pickup, sitting on a black plastic bedliner.

Don't forget to tie it down securely!  Don't fill it to the brim, leave
a quart or two of expansion space in each can.
