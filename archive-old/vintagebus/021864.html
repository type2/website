&gt;14 inch obviously, but 195x75, 185x75, 175x75?????&lt;

This can be tricky since each type of tire will be a little wider/smaller
and such, but generally most people run the 195/75R14.  Also you will want
to get a truck tire with a C or D load rating.  The library should have some
good information on this and specific tires the list likes.

I run 205/75R14s on mine with cheap cheap car tires.  I have no rubbing
issues and like the taller gearing because of the extra circumference.  I am
sure the speedo is wrong though, big deal.  When these tires give up the
ghost I will switch to the heavy duty truck tires.

Good Luck,
