Subject: Re: [VB]Paint Formula

&gt;On the issue of &quot;it's not restored unless it's original color&quot;

I feel like if a bus needs paint, paint it whatever color you fancy. Same
with interior. If your bus interior is trashed and you want to make it
nice, do whatever you want...within reason. (Within reason means no extra
cutting or irreversable damage to the bus that wasn't already there when
you got it). Finding a nice stock original bus would be something you'd
probably want to keep that way. But if the damage has already been done, no
reason you HAVE to fix it back to stock, unless your plan is to sell it.
Then, as we all know, it's worth more in stock original style condition.
