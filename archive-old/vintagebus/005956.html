There is a web site and they also have a neat catalog.

The response I got to my order was that Wolfsburg West sells their sheet
metal here in the US. I hope it's right, otherwise my flame shield is ready.
Ronnie from http://www.type2parts_dot_com used to sell their parts but don't
anymore. Was it WW? I hope so. Correct me if I'm wrong. I deleted their
message.

Later.

&gt; Charlie gave me the name of Allen Schofield (not sure of spelling) who
makes
&gt; repro body parts in England.  Anybody got a web or e-mail address on him?
