Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning hardware

where does a person get the stainless steel shot and what does &quot; burnish
&quot; mean?  thanks
---------------------------Clip ------------------
Burnishing is used to remove burs, stains and polish metal parts or
items.
There are several types of burnishing machines:
#1) Restaurant / Hotel use a vibrating box with round steel balls to
polish silverware.
#2) Foundries use a tumbler with shot (round and diagonally cut round rod
with sharp ends) to de bur and polish castings.
#3) Machine shops use a vibrating box with fine stones in an oil soap
solution to clean sharp edges from parts, de bur the parts.
#4) Shot peening. I don't know if this is in the burnishing descriptions.
#5) There are probably new and better equipment around by now that do the
same thing.
#6) You might possibly get burnishing and de burring services from any
number of plating companies (might need to travel to Mexico to find one
in these times.)
#7) I'd think a lapidary polisher might suit your needs and at the right
price.
------------------
Foundry and machine shop supply houses should have various media.
------------------
I use a three step routine to clean my engine parts; First kerosine, Next
Coleman Lantern fuel, then about 50/50 engine oil and diesel fuel.
Through the shaking, stirring process most engine parts come very clean.
Some bolts need to be replaced when you rebuild an engine:
Pressure Plate to Flywheel, Rod nuts all the others are replaced at your
own choice.
Wavy washers get flat, replace the ones that make you wonder if they are
flat or wavy.
