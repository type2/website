Subject: Do overriders fit both styles of 64-67 bumper?

I have located some solid bumpers w/overriders from a listy and he is too
far away from me to pick up convienently.  I have 2 good shape bumpers that
are longer on top that look sorta like \_______/!!! w/out overriders, but
made for overriders. I was hoping to just buy the overriders!  My bus is a
66 and I would like to know that the overriders will fit even if they are
from one of the rounder styles (67??) bumpers, if not I will buy the whole
thing.  Sorry for my ignorance.  These bumpers are located in GA, close to
TENN if anyone is coming up towards Annapolis Md from there I would gladly
pay you for your delivery services. Hopefully I will work on the bus this
weekend!  The style bumper I have now can be seen pretty well here!,

Have a great weekend,
