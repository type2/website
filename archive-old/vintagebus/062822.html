Subject: [VB] Operation: Bullet Binz (long)



I recently was contacted by the owner of a 58 Binz, who had owned it for the
last 20 years. He had the same last name as me so i knew right away that it
was meant to happen!   It has been sitting in a field shrouded by trees on
his property. I nicknamed it the 'Bullet Binz', because some hunters found
it on his property and decided it would be cool to shoot out all of the
windows and one of the headlight assemblys. The owner had then moved it to
his new property to protect it and had lost interest as he had about 20 or
30 other non-VW projects lined up. He also said he had some other late 50's
ghias on his other property and the vandal bastard hunters had jumped on the
roofs and caved them in. Supposedly nobody knew about this binz and it was
secret, But if you went to church you couldve spotted a glimpse of where it
was hiding due to the location of the church on the hill............




If you read this far, I hope it was interesting enough. Here are the pics
youve been waiting for.
