&lt;&lt; I know it's not friday, but a guy at work today said someone bungie jumped 
a 
 VW bus off the Golden Gate Bridge today in San Francisco.
 Can anyone support this or is it a BS rumor. &gt;&gt;

We saw it on the news tonight (CBS, Dan Rather) Some college kids from Canada 
did it, but, I think it was a bug.
