Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

&gt; 111 953 235 A  Switch - Emergency light from Chassi No. 217 000 001
&gt; Which has 111 953 243 A spindle with knob (12 V) 8/66 - 043 grey black.  
&gt; We have a couple of these.

So does a 66 switch look like a 67 one, ie the knob flashes?  If not how do
you know that the lights are flashing?

My bus has been converted to 12v, and I am not too worried about the
originality of it, its just I really could do with emergency lights.  I have
one small knob like Karls photo for my headlights, and a grey black large
one for my wipers.

&gt; From dealing with a fellow a while back there seems to be a EURO flasher 
&gt; system that has more then only two wires on the switch though!

The switch I have got is the large mushroom type I think, I will post a
photo later on, but you are correct, it has many more than two connections -
so I don't really want to use this as it would mean too many wire
modifications.  The SSVC had an article about retro fitting a two wire
switch I think, so I want to use a two wire switch as it seemed pretty
simple.

Thanks
Paul
