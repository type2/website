Subject: Re: [VB] berg shifter installed

&gt;By &amp; large though his experience has been that both of
these type of shifter seem to get pretty second rate
within 4 to 5 years.
What's the concensus?&lt;

I cannot agree with that at all.  Once you see the Berg shifter you will 
realize what a work of art it really is.

I can see bushings and connectors wearing out in the linkage, but not the 
shifter itself.

It makes the stock shifter look like a piece of tinfoil.

Take Care,
Adrian
