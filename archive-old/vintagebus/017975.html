&quot;it was then that i realized that they were
spinning in place. i then went under it and looked for the back of the two
bolts, but i coulnt find them. so, i was wondering if anyone else has had
this problem and if so, what they did&quot;

this happens on my engine as well, what you need is a tiny vise grip, and or a
friend, and have small hands.

have your friend stick their hand in the engine compartment and spin the nut
there(start with the one on the drivers side), now youget under the bus with a
good utility light and find the spinning bolt. when you find it put a wrench
on it, preferably fo the 17 mm variety. now hold ti there, while your friend
undoes the nut from their side.

You will need to do the same thing on the other side, except here the starter
is in the way, so the light doesn't help much. You will need to find the bold
by feel, sometimes i can reach it from the passenger side, sometimes i have to
reach over the transmission from the drivers side and hold it.

Now for the vise grip...this is for putting the engine back in. Put your vise
grip on the bolt above the starter. Then install engine, the vise grip will
hoold the bolt, and keep it from spinning by hitting hte transmission or
something else near it. After the bolt is tight, it is easier to knock the
vise grip loose.

ps, a few on the list have suggested using tape or some type of silicone
sealant upon re-installing...with the thinking being-if you ever really have
to get the bolt out, the tape or sealant are not too permanent. There is also
a halfmoon bolt that can replace the bolt above the starter, this is supposed
to catch on something near it-it doens't on my engine...

good luck. I think I usually spend about 30-45 minutes trying to get those two
top bolts out(that includes trying to find someone to stick their arm in my
greasy engine compartment)
