Subject: 412 gas heater in a bus?

I am getting a 412 gas heater for free and was wondering if anyone has
adapted it to work in a bus?

The design of it is different than a typical BN4 kind if thing but I am sure
I can mount it somewhere effectively.

I am thinking about making a custom westi rear facing seat (non-walk thru)
and adapting it in there.  Maybe mount it under the bus and tap into the
stock heater channel.  

I am not going to use the stock heat exchanger system, so I need some sort
of heat...  Planning for winter already :)


Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
