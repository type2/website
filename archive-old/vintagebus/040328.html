Thom makes a good point about
the SUV invading your personal space
in a front end collision......_dot_can't
offer much constructive opinion on
this one.....

However, lots of research shows that the
numero uno killer in accidents with
unrestrained occupants are head injuries.
Neck and spinal injuries that are nasty, but it 
is head injuries that accounted for the greatest
number of fatals (by far).  

These head injuries come from two sources
The first is when your head hits structure.
(ergo sash/lap belts and air bags).
The second (often unrealised and almost as common) is when
an unrestrained person flies into another
occupant in the vehicle!

So, one likely place to end up if unrestrained
in the back of a bus during a accident is in the front seat
taking out everyone along the way!

I get quite excited about this.  I speak from
the basis of factual research.  Survival is not guaranteed
in any vehicle in any accident, and buses are 'old' technology
in terms of safety but your chances are 
*significantly* higher if restrained!

p.s. my pages do have some stuff on fitting
restraint mounts in a split that meet Australian Design Regs.

Thom,

Thats generally why i havent felt any special need to add seatbelts to my
61, once you hips are held down, getting rear ended with great force
will snap your spine instead of ejecting you with gret force headfirst
onto whatever is in your cargo area...

Since i have a nice soft westy bed back there, i've elected to take my
chances....

take care,

Steve
