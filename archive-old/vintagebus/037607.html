 Anyway, I am asking this:  Did VW put that grey gunk in the gutters to seal
 the seam between roof and gutter?  If so, should I replace it?  With what? &gt;&gt;


yes it is there for a reason and now your bus will fall apart into intty 
bitty pieces.

actually if you look, vw did put seam sealer at a number of the buses seams, 
not just the roof.  .  check your engine compartment.
