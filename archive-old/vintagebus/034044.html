Bob,  
Thanks for the post. As a EE, I agree with everything you say. As you say ,
calling the Pertronix a true electronic system is probably incorrect as it
uses a traditional coil to supply the spark.

Maybe you could list the various manufacturers and tell us which are strictly
point replacement systems and which also include CDI. Maybe prices also??

Thanks

Jerry Dasson

&quot;To All:

I think it's stretching things a bit to call the Pertronix 'Ignitor'  an
'electronic ignition system'. It is a points replacement module.  The points
make up only part of your ignition system. They happens to be a major part of
the system but you still need a coil, some method of advancing &amp; retarding the
firing point and so forth.&quot;
