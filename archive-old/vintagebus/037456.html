little or no gas, like when you run out/cut out and have to switch to
reserve.   Opinions?&gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
That is like asking if it is not a good thing to run the engine without oil
pressure how do you start it?  Since the oil pressure comes up quickly before
the heat and friction have time to stop the engine all works well.  Or would
the engine not overheat if you drive through the Mohave desert during 105F
outside temperature with the pre-1963 stale air heating system turned on
which would reduce the engine cooling?  Which of course if someone did this
they would probably pass out from the heat and crash before the engine
overheated!  Since you are not going to be able to run the engine long
without fuel then there is not going to be much damage to your fuel pump.  We
have run out of fuel and switched to reserve both on purpose and by accident
while still rolling with no problems or fuel pump failures happening at the
same time.

&lt;&gt;
    Agreed, we keep a log book on each of our VWs not only to keep track of
fuel ups and MPG, but also maintance and need of maintance in the future.
Though when we used to only get 18-19 MPG due to over revving the engine we
used to have to refuel every 100-125 miles to be totally safe.  That made it
really interesting traveling to Texas via highway-10 somewhere in
Arizonia-New Mexico area there is a stretch of about 170 miles between two of
the gas stations out there.  Eric&amp;Barb
