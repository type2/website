problem there is that there arent just holes, threaded inserts are tig
welded to chamfered holes in the frame rails. You would have to make new
holes, and chamfer them and weld. Then you have to make sure hte holes are
aligned right so as nto to mess up your non adjustable caster
angle.  Could be done but i'd slap an adjuster on the beam before i went
to all that trouble...

take care,
