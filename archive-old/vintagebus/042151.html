&gt; &gt;I have heard many stories about the heat flaps and Thermostats.
&gt; 
&gt; Ask five people, get seven opinions...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Some people remove them and say that they are not needed.
&gt; 
&gt; BAP, an Arizona parts chain, doesn't install them on new
&gt; turnkeys.  I was somewhat dismayed by this when I received mine.
&gt; I'm not even sure the new fanshrouds they use even accomodate
&gt; the flap mechanism...  The minute my engine warranty is up,
&gt; I plan to put the original shroud back on there.  (Doing so 
&gt; now would void a 12 month warranty).  

Sounds to me like they don't want to go to the trouble of installing the
thermostat stud in the engine case.  You have to drill and tap a hole.

I don't know if they are using VW fanshrouds, but I'd assume that the new
Mexican ones don't have flaps, or have some sort of fixed air directers.
In mild climates (like Mexico) you can get away without flaps with little
effect but long warmups (which VW de Mexico remedies with the fuel
injection)  In the cold country your engine will run seriously
under temperature.  This is not good for engine life.  If you make a long
highway run and you're able to hold your hand against the case without
discomfort you either have a high pain tolerance or your engine is running
too cold.
