Subject: Heavy pulley reviews needed.

In the past I have heard good reviews of the Latest Rage heavy pulley versus 
the Berg unit.

Is this still the consensus on a good value for a heavy stock size pulley?

Some people I have heard claim the Latest Rage pulley is a cheap import that 
will mar the crank nose because it is not machined well...?  Or conversely 
the Berg unit is impossible to remove from the crank because it is too tight 
or freezes there..?

I have not personally seen either one, so my view is limited to the 
wonderful knowledge of you all here, so let it rip! :)


Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
