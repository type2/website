Subject: Do You Speak American?

So ... PBS has a program called Do You Speak American - sort of a follow up to
The Story of English - hosted by Robert McNeil of McNeil Leher News Hour fame
(BTW - Mr. McNeil is actually a follow Nova Scotian.)  Anyway - he travels
throughout the U.S. noting dialects etc..  - and he travels to California and
hangs out with a surfer dewd and drives in his bus with him - a 70 bay.
