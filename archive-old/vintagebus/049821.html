Subject: Centering the steering wheel - AN APOLOGY

Hello all:

I stand corrected and I apologize for posting a procedure that I had never
actually performed on a bus myself.  I extrapolated from my experience
fixing Beetles and other makes of automobiles.  I neglected to consider the
presence of the drag link, and I was unaware that it also had LH/RH
threads, just like a tie rod.  My Bentley Bus manual has not yet arrived,
which may explain a few things...
