 Hi all listees        

     I am considering purchasing a 1958 VW panel bus for around $3800.00.  The bus is fairly original except for the two front seats as well as the vinyl paneling sheets which have been glued on the inside of the van.  The paint is really nice and the engine is in top notch shape.  The seller stated that a few screws were drilled to mount the paneling---YUCK.  Does this price sound fair???? The seller stated that the price is negotiable so I can probably get the bus for around $3500.00 easy.

     Also, does anyone know where I can purchase a 50's model single cab or double cab VW pickup?  Any leads would be appreciated.  Thanks.
