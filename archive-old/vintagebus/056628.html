Subject: Re: [VB] S0-23 Questions - buy or not?

yes, well, I really don't think anyone would give me $2450 for my 59 flip top 
westy that needs complete resto (PO started taking it apart,but seems all 
there).  Still for sale to good home for less than that. BYOE

&lt;&lt; FWIW, from the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;, here are ballpark values for a
 1960 Type 2 camper:
 
 1--trailer queen, never driven:  $24500
 2--excellent original or superior resto:  $14300
 3--good amateur resto, presentable &amp; serviceable:  $8200
 4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $4100
 5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $2450
 6--parts car:  $800

 &gt; I came across a restored 1960 SO-23 Westy yesterday,
 &gt; the guy is asking somewhere around $10,000 for it.
 &gt; It's the nicest split window bus that I've ever seen
 &gt; around these parts, nice enough that I'm considering
 &gt; trading my cherry '82 diesel westy (+ cash) for it,
 &gt; but I'd like some input from others who have more
 &gt; knowledge about the early westies before I make a
 &gt; move.
