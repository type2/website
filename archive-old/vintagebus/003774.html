Hi gang:

OK, I give!  I've been watching this terms FLAPS in messages for some months
now and can't quite seem to figure out what it means.  The closest I can get
is something &quot;auto parts store&quot;.  I know this isn't critical to
understanding anyone's posting but it's beginning to &quot;bug&quot; me (no pun
intended).

I know what you're all thinking but that's all right....I never do very well
at those before and after puzzles on Wheel either!

Happy New Year to all and remember, the next millenium doesn't start for
another year yet!
