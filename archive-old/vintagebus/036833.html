 mistaken- i have the guys address at work otherwise. $5 for 2 arms so they
 ain't cheap. good point re: the mirrors- then again are the mirrors that
 different from the round ones that are being repopped? what makes the mirrors
 different?? &gt;&gt;

Well, they are sort of a cross between the round mirrors and the elephant ear 
style. They are a smallish rectangular size, with rounded corners, and have a 
seal similar to the elephant ear style.
