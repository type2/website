&gt; Would the front seat be the split version?

I don't think so.  I believe they switched over to the 1/3 2/3 in 64.  63
was the last year for the bench in the Double Cabs.

&gt; Should the rear seat have a hump in it?  Mine does.

Not sure, although it sounds correct.

&gt; 15&quot; or 14&quot; wheels?

I think 15&quot; would be correct.  Switched over to 14&quot; in 64 as well.

&gt; Any double cab owners have a box speaker (5&quot;X5&quot;) mounted above the rear
&gt; window.  Looks factory installed....not sure though.

Not me.  Although I don't even have a headliner, and I'm pretty sure it came
with one.
