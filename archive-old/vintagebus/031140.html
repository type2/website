Subject: [T2] Subaru 1800 in a 71

I suspect the subaru engine will have added torque, which will be a
problem, even with a rear hanger. Some who have put the type 4 engines
in the bus have experienced transmission problems from the increased
torque (as predicted by Bob Hoover). If you are going to do it, you
might want to think about swapping out the transmission with a type 4
unit. Addapters are available from Bus Boys, I think.

Just doesn't sound to be worth all the trouble to me.
