Subject: Engine won't start
Mime-Version: 1.0

Approx. 12-18 months ago I had my Kombi running. I've hadn't had it started
since while I was taking care of the bodywork. So now I've been
unsuccessfully trying to get it started. It's a '75 1600 bug engine. Some
of the things that have changed are:
-new generator
-new voltage regulator
-rebuilt the carb.

The engine turns but won't fire up. I set points (which were new before it
sat), did static time, pulled and cleaned spark plugs (which were good
before as well). 

I've got an electric fuel pump. Engine seems to be getting flooded easily.
But that might be me pumping it. Choke isn't hooked up. It's a 34-Pict carb.

It has tried to fire about 3 times over the last  couple of days when I
tried it. All times were just one &quot;PLUMMM&quot;. 

Hope someone can point me to some things to check. Any ideas would be
appreciated. 

&quot;It ran when I parked it a couple a years ago.&quot; I guess sometimes people
aren't lying when they say that!!!!
