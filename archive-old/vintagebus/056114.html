Subject: fuel pump for H-case

Hi All,

I'm looking to replace the fuel pump on the 67 tipper... it's wrong and I
want to right it.  I'm having a *discussion* with my insurance people right
now so I have a bit of time to fix a few odds and ends.

Anyway, it's supposed to have a H-case in it.  It appears the fuel pump
should have a threaded inlet and a slip on outlet.  What part should I be
looking for.  Are there any other parts I should be looking for.... i.e.
someone already asked me if this thing should have a fuel regulator...
follow the link for a picture of the engine as it is now.

In the long run, what's the best reference to ensure engine correctness? ...
not trying to be AR or anything...


David
