  Hi Ronnie, as Thom added the &quot;Silberweiss&quot;, (silver/white),
 is L82. The PPG number is 'DCC8251'. If you want to see a
 sample I could run a bumper part by your shop. BTW I saw
 Ronnie's 61 SC and it's hard the imagine that it could be 30
 years old! It's what we all hope to find in an old VW.
  Lou in Havasu
  61 Westy- having the 'stroker crank' polished.
  Oval window -on a 71 pan (major project), up for sale.
   65 bug- w/62 sliding roof up for sale also.
