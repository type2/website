&lt;&lt; Also, has anyone ever seen a 6V CB Radio?  *Or* do they know of a way to
 run an alternate power source for a modern one?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Taylor,
You can run a 6 to 12 volt inverter.  So far as we been able to ascertain 
these are only findable used at swap meets and we have identified only two 
manufactures of them.  The &quot;Radio Shack&quot; and &quot;Blaupunkt&quot; inverters.  Most of 
the time when you find these they have been cut out of the vehicle they were 
used in.  So when rewiring them, make sure to install a fuse (15 amp or 
less.) on the positive wire or risk an electrical fire of not only the 
inverter, but your entire wiring harness!
  We are running a Uniden CB in our 1963 6 volt SC (Quick switch setup with 
magnetic antenna, and trailer plug to be able to be moved from VW to VW 
later.), and another in our 1960 panel camper conversion (Installed 
permantly.) which is running on 12 volt.  Operating range between them is 
about 2 miles!
