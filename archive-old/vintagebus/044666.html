&lt;&lt; Agreed, anything else would be uncool and maybe unattractive.  YOM's are a
 great conversation starters BTW.
 two more cents &gt;&gt;

Conversation starter?? Are you serious, like your bus isn't interesting 
enough and you don't have anyone else to talk to anyways? I hate it when 
these wierdos come up and start talking about when they had one and how they 
rolled to New York with five of there best bongs back in 69!!! Or how they 
tell me &quot;you know ya gotta change the motor in these like every two years or 
so&quot; On the way to the classic and my friend mark said that this stoner came 
up to him and thanked him for preserving Americana, give me a f'n break!!!
