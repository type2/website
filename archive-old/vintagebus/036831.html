&lt;&lt; I have a question, I'm having my generator rebuilt right now and they asked
 me what color they should paint the case - black or silver?  They said they
 always paint them when they rebuild. &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
New or newly replated generator we would clear coat it.  If the generator is 
used and the plating is bad then paint it silver.  Also it really helps to 
glue a cardboard (From cereal box!) to the top of the generator stand.  This 
was stock on the 36HP and earlier engines to keep the oil in the crankcase.  
In 40HP and later engines with the seperate generator stands the cardboard 
helps cut down on galvanic corrosion from the three differant metals 
(Aluminum/magnesium case alloy, steel generator casing, and zinc (?) 
plating.) involved.
