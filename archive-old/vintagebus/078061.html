Subject: [VB] 64-67 Reduction box metal plugs


After trying the plastic ones in my reduction box rebuild kit from Long
Enterprises --they sure crack EASY.   I started searching on the internet
and found repo metal ones at Wolfburg West There wonderful , tap right in.
Anyone know if this is a WW exclusive or who repos them ?    Lloyd in
