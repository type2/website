Subject: Re: [VB] 1957 SC for sale!

Wow, and I couldn't hardly give away a fairly dry, running, driving

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; A friend of our's up in the Sea-Tac area (Between Seattle and Tacoma.) 
&gt; is selling his 1957 SC for $3,000.00.  He bought a few years ago from out 
&gt; East of the Cascades where it is dry and VWs tend to be fairly rust free.  It 
&gt; runs and he has had the bed blasted and painted to kill off the surface rust.
