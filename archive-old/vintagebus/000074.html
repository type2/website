 I wondered that too.  The red in that pic is the primer, though.
 
 My technique (ok, so I've done it twice) is to do the bottom, and then the
 top, and I fine-taped both of them.  Maybe it's a better teqnique to blend
 it without taping the first color.

 &gt;On a serious note, people who have painted busses chime in.  Paint a two

 e-shoot
 &gt;the red I guess.  Is it easier to over shoot the top color and then come 
back
 &gt;and fineline tape the swage line??

I painted my 65 westy - originally two tone velvet green/blue white- back to 
those colours from the disgusting badly done metallic blue - with - the doors 
on.

should have done everything blue white, then taped off the top and done the 
green, but didn't.    the first time the white came out wrong, and redid it.  
unfortunately taped off the bottom the second time, I recommend against that.

sometime after april 11 61 they switched and did the whole bus the bottom 
colour, then sprayed on the top colour on the outside, so for your barndoor  
that is why there is so much of the bottom colour around.    Which is why my 
april 61 m130 deluxe has a sealing wax red dash (I like that), and the bit of 
the cab doors just over the door panels is red, except on the door I had to 
replace, I took that one off of a 63 SWR/BG bus, so it looks pretty close, 
except for the paint order having been changed.
