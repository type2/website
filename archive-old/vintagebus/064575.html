Subject: Re: [VB] cylinder studs sealant?

are your studs pulling out?  if you have the motor apart, I'd either look for 
another case or get the inserts put in yours.  I bet you a donut that youre 
talking about an earlier alloy case here if the studs pull out.   I like 
those later alloy dual relief larger oil passage small stud factory installed 
case saver cases.
