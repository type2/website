Subject: Re: [VB] Muffler Noise

&gt; I put on a new, german produced, stock muffler about 1 year ago.  When I start the motor I get a couple minutes of this weird sound.  Best I can describe it is like a tin can crackle???  Goes away when the engine warms up, but drives me nut in the mean time.
&gt;
&gt; Is this normal or preventable???

1) are you sure its the muffler. If it is it sounds like it is hitting
the frame somewhere.

2) It also sounds like the sound a cracked fan hub makes.

At any rate to me it sounds like a mechanical sound. Something loose,
rattling etc....
