Hi Volks,
Whoops!  the shift linkage is just above the front beam, not through it so it 
can be left alone.  Though while the front beam is out it is a best time with 
the added working room to take it apart and grease everything.  Plus before 
you install the new front beam it is alot easier to redo the center 
pin/bushings.   Eric&amp;Barb
