Hi again,

Thanks for all the responses... I went ahead and ordered the whole set form
WCM... Several mentioned WW so I guess if the WCM ones don't work well, I'll
have to order others.

BTW, for those that asked... no, I'm not an alien... although for three
months (10 years ago) I lived near Chicago and rode my bike everywhere and
people looked at me as if I were one and here in Eastern Oregon, since I
don't own a 4x4 with 36+ inch tires, I again feel like one... ;-)


Dave
