Good info Wade. I'd say that it's definitely not worth trying to use these. 
They would take lots of work and wouldn't help me enough in my repairs to 
be worth the work. Guess I will sell them on the samba or on your site.

I REALLY need whole corner sections...but am not having luck finding any so 
far. Will keep looking though. Otherwise I'll be fabricating my own stuff 
to try to fix my messy corners. I could get away with welding in flat sheet 
metal for most of the rear and trying to reshape the actual corners. The 
bottoms aren't really bad, and that's all these sections would fix anyway. 
One one side I've got to replace the vents most likely. But I could 
scrounge those from a bus and weld them in.

Any other ideas? This is a small picture, but you can kind of see my 
corners in it http://www.type2guy_dot_com/59sc/scbck.gif
