Subject: tranny/clutch noise

  We are visiting Las Vegas in our 59 bus and we were looking for a
little help.  We have a 1600 single port with a 65 tranny with RBs.  We
are starting to get a little noise in the rear when the clutch is in,
probably the throwout bearing, (maybe worse?).  We think we will get it
home ok, just a little noise occasionally.  We will need to make about
400 miles to get home.  Any estimates of life expectancy from this
condition?

We were wondering if you could recommend a good parts source here in Las
Vegas where we could get a throw out bearing just in case???   We have
emailed the local AIRS folks also.

Appreciate any help
