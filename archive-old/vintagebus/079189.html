Subject: Re: [VB] shift knobs

The glass knob/burn hole sounds like an urban myth, but I've had a couple of experiences with the phenomenon. 

Our family '58 Plymouth station wagon had an interior fire started by a glass jug filled with water. My brother and I had driven it from Nevada, across Death Valley to the Bakersfield area many years ago. Parked in the sun and a sleeping bag caught fire. Burnt the headliner and we had to drive that stinking car the rest of the summer. 

A molded glass chandelier fob shaped like a disco ball was hanging in our apartment window and burnt a 1/2 diameter spot in the solid oak of a dining room chair. 

I'd guess it depends on the shape of the glass and what's nearby.
