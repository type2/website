Lets kill the thread on the shows, promoting or demoting, and what and who 
everything is or is gonna be.  
Bashing and promoting are things you do at the shows face to face and 
not on this mailer.  I have been to shows all over the world and have voiced 
my opinions with the promoters in PRIVATE.  lets keep it that way guys and 
gals. I have no problem when a business is praised or objected to on orders 
or practices, but that to can be dealt with on another wave length.  It is 
alright to notify people of a show date and some details but re-direction to 
a site should be included.  I hope everyone has a great summer to look 
forward to, but if we can't as a tight community get along amongst ourselves, 
just imagine being on the outside looking in. Happy motoring.........
