Subject: Re:  [VB] Passenger Side Windshield Needed
To: prosser_at_bellatlantic_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I need a passenger side windshield in primo condition.  Must be Sigla,
but any Sigla logo is o.k.

Why can't beggers be choosers?!  TIA.&gt;&gt;


Why don't these folks that are so concerned about the sigla logog, just
take one to their local sign shop and have one made up. It could be made
into a small screen to be screenprinted on or a vinyl mask and used to
paint one on. But I suppose that wouldn't be good enough for the vintage
nazis, eh??!!

funny thing about original windsheilds is they they tend to have that road 
haze on them- you know the millions of tiny scratches from driving down the 
road as the air has stuff in it.  Even without cracks or rocks chips.  so he 
basically wants   a windsheild out of a low milage bus that has been garaged 
so the laminate hasn't separated past the rubber seal area..  Sounds really 
nice, I wouldn't mind a pair as the rock demons have marked both my 
windsheilds pretty fair, think I'll get some new stuff cut as I dont like 
that millions f tiny scratches, but it'll be the wrong thickness, PITA.  I 
put a new windsheild in my bug- dern thing has a *sekurit* logo on it, not 
the same as the spitty glss sekurit logo, but a modern one (and made in 
brasil on it, but I still think that is cooler than some gernic brand.)   But 
it is laminated and  new with no tiny scratches,  it's like looking through 
air!!!!   that glass cost me $25 or $30, why don't they do bus windsheilds?   
I'd love a couple clear new  windsheilds the proper thickness with logos like 
that on them.   Or original sigla logos, or rather Delog would be right for 
my westy I believe.    but no luck.

but I don't understand jeering at someone wanting nice original style pieces 
for there bus.      Maybe people who do that have such cobbled together POS 
buses.  That fixing anything anything with duct tape, rubber bands and 
bailing wire is their way tobe......   

then again Les, you could probably make some money off of those crazy vintage 
nazis by making bus glass- windsheilds of the right thickness with a nice 
sigla or delog logo.  Then you can laugh all the way to the bank.     Bet a 
ton of people would want them- wether cause they have cracks or chips, or 
those horrible marks made by bad wiper blades, or just old scratched glass.  
Or looking for glass as it is missing from the bus they dragged out of the 
weeds.    And you know what,   the same people might be buying replacements 
in a couple years-   a year and a half ago my 65s windsheilds had no cracks 
or chips, now they do!!
