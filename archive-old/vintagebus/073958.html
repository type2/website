&gt; As for bus content, is there a converter that could be used to have the electrical outlet in a bus used for radios ect

Now here we go.....

As for the secondary battery....I think plenty of solutions have been presented lately.

My plans are to do the following before Havasu in Jan.:

Set up a secondary battery with an isolator on the left side of the engine compartment.

Run wire from the secondary battery to the cargo area and hook them up to a 12V lighter socket.  Along with this a voltmeter hooked up near the socket only hooked to the secondary battery.

If needed, I will hook up my converter when camping to run whatever may be needed.._dot_usually a cell phone charger, since I can never find my 12V one.

I know the previous isn't exactly what you are looking for...but do an online search for Camping World and check out their website.  They have tons of converters, a lot of them designed for permanent installation.  I can easily see one of these set up to run on a secondary battery then mated with the existing electrical outlet.  They have to have some type of similar setup in RV's.
