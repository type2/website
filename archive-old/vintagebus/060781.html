&gt; Have you guys been putting the anti-seize on the threads or on the mating

&gt; the lug would bind up.

Hi Steve,
We have done that or old used grease we recycled to lube non-RPM moving 
parts.  Otherwise in our wet climate the lugs would rust badly to the drums 
and even the countersunk areas of the rims wore faster due to rust flaking.  
The most important proceedure to keep your rims on your VW is to use a torque 
wrench to properly and EVENly torque the lug bolts.  The stock lug bolt 
wrench that came with VWs could be used to torque over 300Lbs. and we used to 
use this to torque as hard as possible.  This still resulted in lug bolts 
loosening and even falling out in about a mile!!!  Since we have gone to a 
torque wrench and 85 Lbs. torque the lug bolts do not loosen like they used 
to, but we still check them at about 1/4 mile and five miles after installing 
wheel/s.
