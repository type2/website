&gt; Time to clear your closet of that one small part I need.

I need one of the bulb holders for the '60 to '67 European headlight assemblies.  The part
number is 111 941 159.

It's mostly round and has a 1 1/4 inch spring that you compress as you screw the socket into
the reflective part of the housing.

The part that is not round has two spring-loaded retainers for the running light wires.  The
running light mounts right next to the headlight bulb and sticks through a small hole in the
reflective part of the assembly.

Any help or leads would truly be appreciated.
