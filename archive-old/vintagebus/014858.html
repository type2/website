Subject: Re: [VB] Battery clamp corrosion prevention - WAS: Ignition Switch/Headlight Problem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To keep my battery clamps happy, I've always given them and the posts a
liberal coating of petroleum jelly before assembly.  Put them together
and the excess squeezes out, leaving noplace for corrosion to start.  I
treat everything once per battery replacement and never had any
corrosion at all.

If there is pre-existing corrosion on the clamps, I soak them in a
solution of baking soda and hot water.  This neutralizes any acid that
might be already on the clamp.
