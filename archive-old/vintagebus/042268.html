&gt;  Karl and I tried to do the above on a junkyard 66kombi-camper. Karl
recently found a great junkyard engine on half-price day that was blowing
~135 compression after we fixed the PO botched generator installation,
loose exhaust studs, missing &quot;dime&quot; in the carb, etc. It's a stock
doghouse singleport from a '71 bus with the weird left heater duct. 

'71s were dual port.  I don't think that VW made any doghouse singleports,
at least not to the US.
