If this is of any interest to the bus list, I can print up mouse pads. I
presently have some blank 7.5&quot; X 8&quot; (inch) mouse pads. If anyone is
interested, you can send me a photo or pictures, and I can print a custom
mousepad for about $5 plus shipping. (I don't do this for a living, but I'm
in the early stages of gearing up for my sticker printer business, and I
have the equipment to do the mousepads).  This is not a cheap inkjet printed
mousepad either, but it's not a silkscreened pad either (in other words, I
can do as many colors as you would like).

Thank you

&gt; JWB, posted  a link to a pic of the a Dutch produced mouse pad with lotsa
cool logo'd buses on it. What would it take to get some of those imported?
Could we do a group purchase to save on shipping?
&gt;
&gt; Any dutch listmembers interested in lending a hand?
