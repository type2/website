my 65 westy has lots of M codes, but none that denote a westy.  

the bumpers were noted,. as was the wiring, the steering/ig lock, etc etc, 
the paint codes were there, this type 23 had the interior all blue white, the 
tent brackets through the roof before the camper roof  and westy kit put in, 
but no westy codes, and blissfully no louver windows to cause drafts.
