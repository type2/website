Subject: resevoir is clean!

Hey Y'all
I didn't think mechanical cleaning when I posted.  I now have a really
clean reservoir and fluid tube.  I thought long and hard after a few
suggestions like BBs and such and realized a chemical solution wasn't
the answer.  I didn't have any BBs but I have bins full of little bitty
screws.  I thought about the material I was trying to clean - plastic.
And what it was I was trying to remove (brake gunk from the reservoir).


I used the mildest solvent I could think of - hot soapy water and a
small handful of little screws.  I swirled and swished and sure enough
all the gunkies floated away, suspended in the soapy water.  Rinse most
thoroughly with more hot soapy water.  Let it air dry.  Residual water?
Remember that brake fluid is Hydroscopic (the property of absorbing
water).  Flush with copious amounts of brake fluid.

Thanks to all who replied and jogged my head in the right direction!
Dave
