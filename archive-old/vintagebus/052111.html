Subject: Re: [VB] Any Lawers??????

when i had a serious accident caused by a guy running a red light, i got
recent copies of the NEATO newsletter, showing busses for sale in the same
condition, as well as Hot VW's magazine's classifieds. hey, i figured they
had outrageous prices, and any bit of ammunition in my favor would be a
great help.
a few xerox copies later, to the insurance company of the other driver, and
they settled without any further run around, BS, or trying to offer me $500
for my bus. i got the price I wanted to settle for, not their price.
this was back in the pre &quot;computer&quot; price driven days. i guess computer
(anonymous) generated estimates would work, but printed materials (like
hemmings), personal photos, and physical estimates would probably be better.
good luck.

 Gather any pictures you
&gt; ahve of the bus as proof of it's existing condition
&gt; before the altercation...MAKE COPIES. Meet directly
&gt; with reps from the other peoples insurance, avoid
&gt; phone claim meetings....for sure. Anyway, for me, it
&gt; took a lot of struggle (A LOT) but it was well
&gt; worthwhile and landed me with the exact (if not
&gt; better) bus in the end. Persistence and (forgive me)
&gt; not taking any shit will make the difference. The more
&gt; info you have to offer and educated attitude about
&gt; your VW you can throw around, the better. 

--got any more pretzels? (cough, choke....)
