A friend of mine in Colorado has a set of CE
safaris...first set the frames were so deformed he
could not fit them into the window openings.  CE sent
out a 'better' set of frames.  He says they are about
the same quality as everyone else's repop.  Junky.

I have seen or owned about every repop set made CE and
Izzys have the right outer contour going, but are
still of the crappy single chanel manufacture that all
the repops have. Origibal are double walled steel with
a fitted male female connectors.  This adds rigidity
and strength which protects glass cracking ect...plus
the fit is always superb.  And out of nearly 10 sets
of originals I have never seen a broken original VW
latch...NEVER!

Yes, I know they are very very hard to come by but
they do exist and with some patience and 'serious'
looking you will get a set.  Just don't frown at the
price tag the originals bring...they are worth it. At
$574 for a set of junky repops the prices originals go
for seems more then fair or sometimes even low!

Too bad someone can't step up to the plate and make a
good consistent repop.

&gt;  &quot;You should have got Bus Boys Safaris from me -
&gt; Much better ! ( &amp; cheaper ! )
&gt; Creative seals are not moulded, I should have the
&gt; moulded ones in stock soon !&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that CE were the best...  am I wrong??
&gt; BTW  I have a set of Wolfgang safaris in my bus now,
&gt; and they suck!   The shape of the frame don't fit at
&gt; all!
&gt; And the latches are not looking right...
