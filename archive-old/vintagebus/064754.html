&gt; I have that exact same rack by the way(happen to know anything about it?). 

Hi Andrew,
We are pretty sure it was a USA manufatured rack.  It originally used spring 
loaded clamps.  One can use hardware store turn buckles to easily make clamps 
for it.  We had one of those racks and Clara ended up with it.  We did not 
like its lack of strength compared to German manufactured racks, and since we 
are the official NEATO bus loading champions.....
