Subject: Jerome Jamboree

Hi all.  Just wanted to give a little update regarding Jerome Jamboree and 
highlight some of the important items.  

First and foremost it is now officially a 3-day event, September 12, 13, 14.  
The caravan leaves Phoenix on Friday the 12th at 9:00 AM.  The gate opens at 
Jerome at NOON on Friday.  The chili cook-off is Friday evening.  First raffle 
of the weekend will be Friday evening.  Preliminaries for the slow drags are 
Saturday around 11:00 AM, with an early afternoon raffle and another in the 
evening.  We'll finish up on Sunday morning with slow drag finals, car show 
awards and final raffles.

In case you haven't heard, this year's raffle bus is a white over green, 1967 
13-window Deluxe.  Our website isn't updated yet, but will soon have a wish 
list for needed parts for the raffle bus as a couple of photos of the bus now 
that it is painted.

Swapping by general participants is encouraged.  ALL new item vendors must 
pre-register (before showing up at the event) and must set up along &quot;vendor 
row&quot;.

Admission is still $10 per vehicle per night, and raffle tickets are still 
only $0.50 each.  You must be a paid participant of the event to buy raffle 
tickets.

For further details, email me off-list.
