Subject: flagstaff busses

just took a Family Trip From Hell to the Grand Canyon... saw more 
busses in Flagstaff in 1 hour than i have in Phoenix in 3 months!
some guy on the main road just north of flagstaff has two splitties 
(one nice-lookin, the other a project) in a yard otherwise full of 
old chevy trucks. some bays - one for sale - and on the way back to 
sedona, i saw a splittie parked off route 189... tan housepaint, 
elephant ears, license plate 510-CAD or similar. any listee headed 
for jerome??? my parents - NOT bussers :P - refused to stop and see 
if assistance was necessary.

ah well... NEXT jerome, i convince the wife that the son's birthday 
be held up there!
