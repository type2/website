Hello

My girlfriend are going to Sydney, for working there in about ½ year. I'm
going to visit her in October.
She need a BUS to drive around in (we also need it when we (me and my 9 year
old daughter) get over there, to sleep in)
We don't need a fully restored BUS, but it should be releiable.
She will be driving to and from work every day, seeing Sydney and roundings
in weekends, and when we get over there we will drive up north to Brisbane
and back.
There don't have to be anything In the cargo room, we will rebuild it to one
big bed with space below.
And the price not over 2000 AUD.

You can buy it back when she are going home in December / January...

We will also be interessed in renting a bus

And last....... It don't have to be a VW Bus  :-(

PLEASE HELP PLEASE

If you can help us mail to : splitbus_at_mail.dk
