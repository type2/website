Subject: RE: [VB] Anyone have Sundial tent pics ?

Hi Sean,
You can lay the top of the tent canvas out, and pretty much figure out how
to put the support poles together.

The two poles that have an &quot;angled-off&quot; arm at a 90 degree angle to the
poles are the ones that fit into the brackets on the roof of your bus, (you
do have the brackets, right?  If not, they can be ordered from PLF, which is
the link that another person left you on his reply).  The brackets fit onto
your roof, and are held in place by two screws each.

If you are still having trouble, let me know and I will try to take pictures
of how the poles go together and post them.  If you need poles, or even a
whole set, Hotdog Fred can make them for you for a very reasonable price.

Good luck,
Ed
