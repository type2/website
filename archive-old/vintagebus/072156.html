Ticked?

Flea Powder will work for this Stan--

Stay out of the woods--this will help.

I think ths is a riot--how perspective buyers start chopping you up on
your price, when they haven't even taken the time to look or drive the
vehicle.

This is called &quot;internet feelng you out&quot;, to see how gulable you
are--and this is not a new phenomina--

I have people doing it to me all the time, and i don't even waste my
time responding to them
It's the Freddie the Freeloader sydrome.

Ignore it--get some Hartz Mountain flea powder for them ticks and you'll
be OK--:&gt;)

Oh--and you want to know what anything is worth---??

Go to--www.Terrence'sVWvalue'sonline

This is the place to find out what any VW is worth--:&gt;)


Later,

Terry

[WetWesties] Friday Rant .............. only my first for today. 
As the current seller of two VW vehicles.
http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/66westy.htm
http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/83westy.htm 
I'm getting a little ticked off when people start demanding that I lower
my price without ever have driven or had first hand view of my vehicles.
I looked at two VW Busses this week in my local area. Both busses had
dead engines and both had major problems ............... this makes them
salvage or parts busses in my mind. I didn't insult either seller, I
simply stated that I should be considered a salvage buyer and if as a
last resort they would rather see the buy go to restoration than to a
wrecking yard I'd be a last resort buyer. 
I know Texas is a dead zone for selling any type of VW Bus or Vanagon
because I've never sold any of eight or so VW Busses or Vanagons to a
Texas resident. 
Who sets the value on VW Busses?
It certainly can't be E bay.
