List-
Someone previously suggested sorting techniques
and storage procedures for the Huge Volume of Mail
that these bus lists produce.
My PC is rapidly approaching critical mass ( i believe
that Outlook Express has a limit ) and i would prefer
to personally archive my collection and not delete it,
but also have ready access to the history.
If this is a suitable Friday topic, then perhaps the
resident geeks can instruct the PC-challenged among us
into a more efficient manner of dealing with the mail
and keep more of us on board.
Dave
