yes, if you connect the two wires together at the sensor the brakelights 
should go on.

if they don't, check to make sure you have power to the sensor.  Take your 
test light and check both wires- one of them is hot, but they are both the 
same colour (black/red)   If there is no power there, your problem is before 
that- have you checked your fuses?

If there is power there, check to see if you have power at the taillight bulb 
holders.  if you have power there, but the brake lights don't work, it could 
be a bad ground, bad bulb, bad bulb holder, do your taillights/turnsignals 
work?  

BTW, are you checking w/ ignition on?
