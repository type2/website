Subject: Re: [VB] Problems already... Dowel pin dilemma

I learned a couple of tidbits today:

1) If you have a crank drilled for 8 holes and a flywheel drilled with 4
(or vise versa), it is a good idea to fill the unused holes with half
dowels, to provide a little extra strength around the dowels that are
actually in place.

2) I am told that the 4 holes in my new flywheel are NOT 90 degrees
apart, and if I turn my flywheel just right, it should match up to the
unused holes on my 8 hole crank. Apparently, this is the way all cranks
and flywheels are drilled (with one hole slightly offset) to ensure that
if the crank and flywheel are balanced together, they will remain
balanced together after teardown and reassembly. This makes sense to me,
now I'm just waiting for it to stop raining so I can test out this new
information... Maybe I won't have to remove all those dowels, after all!

More later,
david
