George, All,
	The volcanic dust wind tunnel report I gave gives us all material to
interpret.  George says that since the dust stuck that the air was
moving slower along the sides of the scooped '67.  This allowed the dust
to adhere.   Earlier George wrote that turbulence along the sides of the
bus would limit the amount of smooth flowing air to enter the scoops. 
Wow!   The dust was very fine and most of it actually just fell off over
the still night.  Closing the side doors most of the dust fell off of
that side.  I think that turbulence would have knocked off any fine dust
as it was being deposited.  
	There may be another explaination.  The Elk!  The male elk were in rut
at the time.  At night you could hear them roaring from various parts of
the valley and mountain.  It was a still night and the sound was really
travelling.  Perhaps the dust stuck to the sides of the bus because of
some special sort of elk psychosexual-mechanical glue.  Maybe we can get
George to mount some of his sensors on the bull elk to measure this
phenomenon.  Maybe listees have some ideas of possible placement
locations!  Gary Gibson  Tucson
