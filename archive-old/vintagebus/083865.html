&gt; 
&gt; Since I see we are in wiper mode, is there a way to
&gt; tell what ( 6V or 12V) armature is in the wiper motor
&gt; housing?

Not off the top of my head.  There is probably a
difference in thickness and turn count of windings, but
I've never put a 12 V and a 6 V next to each other and
counted.  There may be a part number on the outside
that will tell you what it was originally, and I _think_
the 12 V motors were stamped/marked &quot;12 V&quot;.

&gt; Motor sounds sluggish and wiper shafts are moving slow,
&gt; also there is some smoke coming from the motor. Doesn't
&gt; smell like electrical though, smells like oil burning.

Pull motor, disassemble gearbox, clean out old grease,
relube, reassemble.  It'll work a lot better.  On mine
the oil was separating from the grease, running down the
shaft, and fouling the commutator; if yours is doing that
it would explain the oil burning smell.  See

more tips.
