&lt;&lt; I need three stationary windows for the fixed side windows (stationary) on 
my 
 57 standard.
 Need the &quot;SIGLA&quot; laminated glass.
 Logo should look something like this.
 
        SIGLA
         AS-1
 Made in Germany
 
 There are other styles which say (D-06, or made in west germany, these will 
 NOT work for me)
 
 The glass can be cracked (NOT preferred) or delanimated (NOT preferred)
 
 I need these to replace cracked ones in my glass cab divider. If someone has 
 one with the correct glued on &quot;knob&quot; let me know. If not, I guess ill have 
to 
 make one.
 
 Id get them cut except they need to be of metric thickness to fit in the 
 channels.
 
 Please email me with what you have.
 Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
 Regards, Greg
