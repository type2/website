&gt;Picked up an early barndoor dealer catalog today and don't know what
&gt;year it is. It shows single cabs with smooth side gates and none of the
&gt;other buses have rear bumpers except the 23 window and it has the alum
&gt;trim on rear corners, even has a nice picture of a double door panel
&gt;( like the 54 I used to own ). Shows an ambulance also. I think it is
&gt;a 52 or 53, but how can I tell for sure? Thanks
&gt;
Probably '52 'cause March, '53 gave Deluxes rear bumpers, late '53 gave
Single Cabs stamped sides...  What's the form # on the back (if there is
one)?

Ambulances began in '51.

Well, gotta go swimming,
