Well, I’m sad to say but my 59 kombi is up for sale.  I have enough VW’s for 
now.  It is for sale in Portland, Oregon.  So here are the details:

Its dove blue with new primer and paint.  New windows(except for front 
doors) and seals.  New door seals.  New brakes, rebuilt master cylinder, new 
fuel lines, cleaned fuel tank, new tires.  GLASS rear taillights, new bullet 
lights in front.  New interior door panels and front seat upholstery and 
padding.  Original black floor mats.  Heat works.  Original 36 HP engine.  
This bus runs great.  I love to toodle around town in it but also have other 
VW’s that I’m more attached to.  I did paint it myself only to preserve it 
as it had completely faded paint when I bought it.  In Oregon it rains like 
crazy and I just wanted to preserve it so it didn’t rust any further.   
There is no rust and no holes in body.  There are a few dings in rear 
corners and lower front clip.  I did not want to attempt body work as we are 
not professionals and refused to put bondo on this bus.  Otherwise the bus 
is perfect and about 75% restored.

Asking 4000.00
also looking for a tent for a 71 camper :)

Mike
