I drove to Longview, Texas this morning to see what was going on with my 
cars. I was
a bit concerned, because I own a 1956 Oval Window,  a 1957 Oval window, a 
Type 3
pickup, a Type34 Karmann Ghia, a 1965 23-window bus, and above all a 1949 
Hebmuller that are being restored at that shop. I haven't heard from the 
owner in about two months, and he has been avoiding me. His phone had been 
disconnected, his brother had no listed phone number, his dad was getting 
tired of my calling all the time, and he had spent one day avoiding me while 
I made two trips to Longview about a month ago. I wrote him a certified 
letter outlining my concerns, but his wife signed off on the letter. I could 
think of a million things why he was avoiding me - perhaps bankruptcy, 
perhaps he had lost the body to the Heb (I haven't seen it for a year and it 
has no body on it right now), etc. etc. 

Anyhow, I left Dallas at 4:00 AM and got to Longview about 6:00 AM. I let the 
shop owner's brother get away. But I caught another fellow who told me to 
park behind the owner's pickup and wait until 8:00 AM. Sure enough. I caught 
the owner about 7:45 AM.

It turns out that his wife had left him, and he was too proud to let me know. 
Anyhow, I 
made arrangements to have him fix the engine on the Type 3 pickup and put 
some new tires and a battery on it. I missed the May 7 deadline (Ennis, Texas 
bug-in) for
the Hebmuller. But hopefully, these problems are behind me now. He's into me 
for
about $9,000 on the Heb plus he owes me about $700 for the 1956 Oval window, 
which I agreed to sell to him. He has done the work on the Heb, but I haven't 
seen it yet. If he finishes the Heb, I won't be hurting too much. If he 
doesn't finish it, I'll be in deep doo-doo. He gave me the e-mail address of 
a fellow who has the missing skylight windows for the 23-window bus, and I 
have sent him an e-mail.
