Hey Gary, welcome to the list.

Question, have you completely disconnected the heater cables and driven it to see if warm air still
comes out of the heater?

If you have done this and warm air still comes out, you can take the heater duct off and put your
hand in the opening of the exchanger to see if the flap is closing all the way. If it is not, move
the lever that activates the flap back and forth to see if it is binding somewhere. Sometimes, it is
just a matter of bending the lever one way or the other or oiling the mechanism.

Also, with the heater cable disconnected, check to see that the cable is not binding in the open
position when you turn the heat off in the cab.

So I will start off with my first question, I tried
adjusting the heater cables last nite, but it seems the flappers in the heat
exchangers are just not too effective at blocking off the flow of warm air.
It's hot enough in Austin with out heat coming thru the defrost ducts!
