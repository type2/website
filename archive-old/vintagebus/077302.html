&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt;   I used to be a rural post office worker, had a rhd
&gt; jeep, didn't like it
&gt; for anything but delivering mail.  It wasn't my
&gt; favorite way of getting
&gt; around regularly is what I mean.  It would be
&gt; different if I lived in the
&gt; land of Left side driving.  I understand why they
&gt; put the driving wheel on
&gt; which side for which way of driving.  Maybe it I'm
&gt; overlooking something?

Joe, all the best cars are the RHD ones.
See, if you drive on the CORRECT side of the road(the 
left) RHD vehicles are fine.
And let's face it, the left is best.
Here in the real world(Australia, UK, New Zealand,
etc.) it's the only way to drive.
Europe &amp; the US simply got it wrong ;o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
