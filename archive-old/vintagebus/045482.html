&lt;&lt; i may well be wrong but isn't the 80 series (ratio) ((whatever)) the
 standard.&gt;&gt;
Hi Glynn,
Sure it is standard, but there are sizes out there that are not standard.
 
&lt;&lt; ie mostly not quoted... (85 14  = 185 80 14?).&gt;&gt;
Right, but you could also try out a 195/80R14.  Wider, and thusly taller in 
the rear if they will not fit in the front.  Unfortunitly we are more used to 
15&quot; tires and not 14&quot;ers.  We are running a 235/75R15 tire in the rear of our 
1963 single cab right now to get the stock geared tranny up to a speed that 
barely makes us safe on the highway.  Have a friend who recently bought some 
14&quot; large diameter 4 ply tires for his 1971 westie.  They really have 
improved not only his top speed, but the tires he is now using are alot 
better than the old ones that left him get pushed from lane to lane in heavy 
winds.  Will see if he will Email us the size and make he is running.
