Subject: Re: [VB] Broken vlave spring #3 nearly new engine-R and R help

hm- first thing I wonder .. is there a warranty on your nearly new motor with 
broken valve spring?   Where did you get your rebuildt heads?  or new heads?  
Do you actually see a broken valve?  why do you think that is the issue?  Yes 
you could remove the rocker arm and remove the valve spring and put a 
new/good used one in there, you need a tool to compress the spring, then you 
can remove the little half circle clips (don't drop them!  use a magnet to 
pull them off the valve!), then the cap and spring come off when you release 
the spring compression tool.   Remember - if you remove the rocker arms you 
need to regap valves in 200 miles as the bits settle in.

But I wonder why it broke? If may be a good idea to think about that... is 
the rest of the head okay?    Got a receipt for your motor or head?

 to test compression.
 I see the front most #3 exhuast I believe has a broken valve spring.
 Am I correct in removing the pivot rod assembly, sliding off hat
 retainer, and replacing srping, retorqueing and regapping valves, or is
 the fix more complex than that? I wonder if I need compressed air like a
 chevy to keep valve in place? I can do that with my leak down tester,
 just use lower pis so engine doesn't go flying.
 Are all stock valve spring similair?
 My heads are 311 ---179a .
