Subject: Re: [VB] uneven idle

Hi Jim,
The fact the choke was adjusted to be on all the time screams bad jetting in 
the carb and/or perhaps badly adjusted.  Suggest you take the carb apart and 
throughly clean it out and check the jet sizes and compare them to the stock 
ones for 1969-70ish bus.  Which should be close to what you need.  Also would be 
good to know if you are using a stock oil bath aircleaner, muffler, 
distributor, etc...
  Having the choke on all the time is not good for MPG or engine longevity.
