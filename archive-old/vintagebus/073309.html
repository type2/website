Subject: Re: [VB] Bit of a find

To ME, it appears to be 3/55-57.5 by the blanking
plate over the hole for the brakelight on the declkid
in pic #3. Mine had the same thing on it before I
removed the plate and put the light back in.
It really appears to be at the very least pre 58.5
with the pressed/stamped front bumper. A bus that
early would not have an ID tag in the front cab area,
just a body number stamped behind the front seat on
the bulkhead. It's not a VIN number, but it might get
you closer to year identification.
I full agree that if you can't get it, you should
either part it out (safaris-complete, bumper, etc) or
let someone else know about it so maybe they can save
it/part it. It looks like it has too many &quot;good&quot; parts
to send to the scrap with those parts still on it.

&gt; I'm stumped.
&gt; The sad thing is it is heading for the crusher in 2
&gt; weeks.
&gt; Should I grab it?
&gt; I'm not real inspired as it seems like a bit of a
&gt; dead
&gt; loss per its condition plus it's sitting between 2
&gt; very swampy sections of ground.
