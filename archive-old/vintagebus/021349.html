I stopped by a junkyard a couple weeks ago that had a couple type iv bays and
half a dozen mid 70s type 1s.   I saw those single side cover trannys, and
thought, Todd wants tose, but I am not spending all day here.    I saw some A
cases with possibly thin studs/factory installed case savers, and thought 'I
could build a nice noew motor for my westy on one of those'.  I saw lotsa
doghouse stuff.    I took some light bulbs, bulb holders, and a ACCELERATOT
BOWDEN TUBE.  I put one in my westy and have more gas pedal- direct link w/o
that wiggle.  very cool.  also took some of theose stock in line fuse holders,
as I believe engine compartment lights should be fused, which I didn't think
about when putting one in my 61.  And some of those cool connector you put
between two or even three push on connectors, they have clear plastic stamped
with the VW logo.

I shold have grabbed a horn, but I do prefer 6V horns, they are obnoxious and
more to the point.
