&gt;I am still looking for a set of four gray painted hub caps.. NOS or in
&gt;very good condition. I have looked at all the parts vendors and still
&gt;would like to have the real cigar for my &quot;58&quot; double door panel van. If
&gt;any one can help I would be so happy.
&gt;
Wolfsburg West told me theirs are NOS, not repros.  That surprised me
because the color is not exactly the same as one I took off a Commercial Bus
at the junkyard.  They also said they were almost out of them?

Good luck,
Everett Barnes
