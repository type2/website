Neil:

There is no need to mess with plastic plugs or trying to salvage used ones.
We carry new steel ones for $13.95 each. They are exact reproductions of the
originals.

Thank You!

Those plugs are junk, they are plastic.  VW did not put plastic plugs in the
back of reduction boxes, why should you.
