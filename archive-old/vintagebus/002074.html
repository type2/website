I wasn't going to post this to the list but since my last confession
generated an avalanche of other confessed mistakes and blunders we've made
in the
past, I figured this one deserved exposure.  Even though it happened on my
daily driver (74 Super known as Li'l Red), it could still happen on any T1
powered vehicle.

I changed the oil in Li'l Red earlier this year and ever since that time,
I've had trouble with the sump plate leaking.  Also too are the spring
loaded pushrod tubes which I was warned about being a source of leakage.
The oil leakage was quite chronic here the past few months - in the
neighborhood of a quart per month so I finally decided to get underneath
Li'l Red before taking him to Frank's house and do some last ditch efforts
to try and stop the leakage.

First I armed my ratchet with a 10mm socket.  I also blasted the sump plate
free of the gravel and oil mixture with brake cleaner and saw plain as day
how the oil was seeping from around the sump plate.  I tightened down the
nuts and additional 8th of a turn.  A combination of gasket crush and a limp
wrist was probably to blame for that blunder.  As I maneuvered around my
trailer hitch and the sump plate VDO temp sender, I bumped the wire and
thought I saw the sender move.  By george it DID move!!!  I could work the
sender in and out by hand!  YIKES!  I snugged it up with the crescent wrench
and now guess what?  No Mo' oil slicks on the driveway and no trickling oil
puddles on the sloped parking stall at work!

I just hope I don't have to go scrub up the spots at work now.  :-)  And
that's my dumb story.  I assumed this pushrod tube related and maybe a hint
of sump plate probs as well.  Little did I know that I just needed to
tighten things up. :-)
