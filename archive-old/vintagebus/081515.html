Subject: winterizing a bus :)

On a simple manually switched parallel battery system, you can charge them 
both at the same time. I wouldn't flip the switch while the charger is 
attached. I also wouldn't charge it for more than 24 hours at a time. 
Overcharging a battery is as bad for it as letting it sit and discharge 
through disuse.

--------------------

 If I want to charge the battery time to time (It has 2 batteries) can I
charge the main battery with a charger and at the same time turn the switch
on so it charges both the accessory battery and the main at the same time?

ie. Manual switch to connect the two batteries while driving.. for charge.
Can I flick the switch while it's parked and hook the charger up to one..
charging both at the same time?
