Dear Folks,

A cute guy going to med school. hahahaha! Just kidding. Clean is good. Would
it be too much trouble to put the front interior panels back on? Stuff
catching onto and eating clothing is not good.

Show her how to get into the bus (step here, grab hold here...). Don't just
leave her standing there with her hands full (if she's got a purse or a
sweater hold on to them for her while she gets in and then hand them to her
after she's settled). She'll think you're really neat if you act like you
care enough about her to help her out a little. Believe me, nobody likes to
look stupid doing something for the first time and although we're used to it
most people are a little buffaloed by the height of our go-hicles and
getting in is awkward until you get used to it at which time she'll just
dump her purse and sweater in the space between the seats so be sure the
cooler is closed :-).  Which leads us to:

Cool drinks are a good idea. Put the cooler between the seats like I do when
the concrete block emergency brake/cup holder is not in use. That makes a
dandy snack table too.

Try to drive smoothly. I drive Gus like what he is-a truck and sometimes my
passengers complain as they feel like they are flying around the cockpit (I
forget they aren't holding on to the steering wheel). Try to keep the g's
down :-) in the turns.

Be sure whatever you have in the back is secured. Even though we know that
stuff sliding around is okay, it might make someone else a little nervous.

Otherwise you should be fine (if you've got one of those cute little blumen
vases be sure it's got flowers in it). If the lady is worth her salt she'll
like you and the bus (just be sure it ends up in that order or you could be
in trouble-&quot;I'm sorry darling I like you, but it's your bus that makes me
crazy in love&quot;). Nah....no worries...tell her you are a package deal. :-)
