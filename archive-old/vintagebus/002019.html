Subject: Domelight Harness Wires
Date: Sat, 29 Jan 2000 08:46:35 -0800
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

We're about to install a headliner in our '58 23 window, and want to make
sure we've got all the connections for our domelight harness accounted for.
Does anyone have information on what the two wires that go to the very back
are for? These go beyond the positive wire for the rear domelight. Thanks.
Chris &amp; Gina
