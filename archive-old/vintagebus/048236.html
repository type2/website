In a message dated 98-08-16 18:20:53 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; A gauge was installed by some PO, but the engine that is in there now, only
has the idiot light sender unit. I got the 80 pi with warning light  sender
from rmmw and installed it ...... The package the sender came in was opened
and included no directions ....... The unit itself has 2 screw on connectors,
one labeled G, and the other WK. I've tried all possible connections from the
idiot light and gauge, the gauge always sits at zero and the idiot light won't
go off........ So I want to get this one
 working or put the other one back in before I go anywhere ......... any ideas
on how to hook this thing up?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Tim,
G stands for the gauge.  Take the wire from the gauge that hooks to the G
termial on the back of the gauge and hook the other end of the wire to the G
terminal on the sender.  WK stands for the oil pressure idiot light.
Personally we prefer to use a brass T fitting to use both the oil pressure and
a seperate idiot light sender.  That way if one goes out you just have to
replace what you need to not both in one.  Also you should get trailer wire
that has three or four individual wires in a bundle with insulation over all
of them on top of the individual insulation.  21 feet does the job and you
need to just drill one hole in the front of the engine compartment and one in
the nose up above the belly pan.  Grommet both holes and thread the trailer
wire to and from, so you can do more than one gauge in the future with just
one wiring job.
