Subject: tranny howl question

On the '55 SC I just bought, there is a horrific howl in first.
People can hear it *outside* the car!

2nd thru 4th are fine, and shift beautifully, but it appears
that the tranny was driven for quite a while low on fluid.  When
I changed it the other night, there was only about a pint of 
fluid in the center section.  Changing the fluid helped, but
didn't fully abate the noise.

I know there's no magic cure, but I'm curious as to what's
toasted: bearing?  Gear?  I'm guessing the bearings that 
first rides on are toast, but aren't they common with second?
