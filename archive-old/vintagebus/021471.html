&lt;&lt; we changed the coil to add some power, and plugged up remaing holes from 
non-existing heat riser tubes. We also added heater boxes back in place of my 
j-tubes in order to buffer the heat from the push rod tubes. &gt;&gt;
Hi Daniel,
Running heater boxes is a good idea, but running them without the fresh air 
tubes to them from the fan shroud will make the pre-1972 engine run about 30 
F hotter oil temp.  Do yourself a favor and only use paper covered air tubing 
and at least hose clamp these hoses at thier tops onto the shroud.  Eric&amp;Barb
