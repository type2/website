Hi Adrian,
Sounds like you have a weak coil or perhaps a bad connection to the coil.  
Coils with the riveted on male connectors really need to be soldered on to 
prevent this.
 
&lt;&lt;Right now I am leaning towards just disabling the choke altogether like St 
Muir advises :)   I am not sure if this would affect drivability that much?  
&gt;&gt;

Depends on where you live and drive!  If it stays above 70F all the time then 
you probably do not need it.  If you live in the PNW with our cool, wet, 
humid six to eight months of the year you do need it.  When using an electric 
choke we prefer to set/adjust it lightly as possible and assist it as 
necessary with footwork on the gas pedal.  Manual choke is our absolute 
favorite!
