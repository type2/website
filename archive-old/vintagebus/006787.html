Upon further examination I checked them against some early bug ones, new not
NOS and all that is done is the manufacturer machined the flat spots in them
for the lever so these so called bus ones are really modified bug ones,
another rip off from the manufacturer. I checked some OG bug ones and they
work backwards on a bus. So I will take some of my OG ones and rebuild them
and offer those for sale, so at least we will have the correct position for
our cable


ronnie &quot;finding manufacturers flaws all the time&quot;

Me too.  They aren't NOS.  They are Brazilian I think.  WW told me they
are made backwards now after I had purchased it.  I'm not sure if their
rebuild kit would solve the problem.  Maybe used your old tap and put a
kit in?
