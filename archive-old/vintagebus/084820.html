&gt;he still doesn't list a name i can tell the flap monkey; gonna have
&gt;to find a REAL parts store somewhere.

The &quot;usual suspects&quot; for goop include 3M, Permatex, and Loctite.
Digging around, it looks like &quot;3M Scotch-Grip Rubber &amp; Gasket Adhesive
847 - 847-L - 847-H&quot; might be a good candidate, but it doesn't come in a
spray can.  Permatex has a handy dandy product selector that leads you
to several different products depending on what criteria you select.
The only one that comes in a spray and has &quot;elastomeric&quot; in the
technical data sheet is &quot;Permatex High Tack Spray-A-Gasket Sealant&quot;,
part number 80064 (6 oz) and 80065 (12 oz).  Loctite has lots of
form-a-gasket stuff but doesn't seem to have much in the way of
dressings for gaskets you already have.

&gt;btw, anyone have the length of 6mm stud i would need to replace a
&gt;sump stud in the crapcase? one keeps coming unscrewed every oil
&gt;change, even w/ loctite green.

If &quot;Loctite green&quot; is #290, that seems reasonable.  That stuff is
supposed to be thin and &quot;wick in&quot; to an already-assembled fastener.  But
it won't stick when there's oil around, which there will probably be on
the sump plate studs.  What you probably want is #242 blue or #262 red.
Take the stud out, put a cap nut on one end, hold it with pliers on the
nut, and hose it down with brake cleaner.  Also hose down the hole in
the case - watch out that the cleaner doesn't get in your eyes.  Put
some Loctite on the case end of the stud and some in the hole in the
case, then screw in the stud.  If you want a picture, see Loctite's &quot;Do
It Right&quot; information:
http://www.loctite_dot_com/int_henkel/loctite_us/binarydata/pdf/lt1475b_DoItRight.pdf .

Original stud lengths at http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/079439.html .
Kyle's procedure for replacing studs with bolts is at
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/002397.html .

If none of this gets you anywhere, it might be step-stud time.  When you
drill out the case, use a brace and bit, or go really sloooooowly on the
electric drill.  When Dad and I did this on his Bug, the case sort of
grabbed the drill bit and we ended up with a slightly crooked hole.  It
seals up OK but you have to hold your mouth just right when you're
trying to get the sump plate on.
