&lt;&lt; Also what are the best shocks for my bus... I want a soft/ comfortable 
ride 
 (or at least as close to one as I can get w/ my '59... &gt;&gt;

Hi Pete,
If you want soft ride get an old Cadilac.  Of course drivng that water bed 
like suspension you will not be able to do the turns as fast as you could in 
your bus!  
GR-2s by KYB are probably the best all around shocks fo the bus today.  They 
are stiff enough to help prevent so much swaying of the bus in turns, side 
winds, while being passed by semi trucks or dangerous oscilations while 
heavily loaded over rough pavement.   We use the gas adjust shocks KYB makes 
in our 1963 SC and they are stiffer than thier GR-2s, but because the truck 
gets loaded often it is a blessing!  Eric&amp;Barb
