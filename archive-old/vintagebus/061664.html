&gt; Damn, wish I had a FLAPS around here.

&gt; I'm still struggling to come up with a shock for my slam-o-matic that is
&gt; short enough. All the local stores keep asking for an application. I
&gt; take the bug lowering shocks with me and say &quot;I need something about 2
&gt; in shorter than this&quot; and they ask &quot;what's it for&quot;. I'm really tempted
&gt; to tell them &quot;Your mom&quot; but know that won't go anywhere good. The
&gt; concept of digging through a few boxes is _completely_ alien to anyone
&gt; and the standard bus shock is (obviously) about 16&quot;. Grrr...

Try contacting Toxic shocks or KYB directly. Give them your max length and
minimum length and they find something for you.
