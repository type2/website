&lt;&lt;me know.  They pay good money - in the region of  £100 / day, and you
can drive it to the set
to keep an eye on it.&gt;&gt;

Good Money?? Doesn't that convert to about $200 or $250 a day??

If I were putting my vehicle in a commercial, my contract with them
would have to stipulate that I be there. And my day rate is at least
that much. Personally, I don't think anyone should provide a vehicle
unless the day rate is at least $400. These people (ad men) can and
should pay adequately.

I once had to provide my services for a commercial and I gave em a price
in the stratosphere (at least thats what I thought). They didnt even
blink. My price included supplies so I hit em hard again on that end.
Naturally, they never called me again. But they weren't going to
anyways. These ad people think their crap is odorless. And they think
you should just be oh so thrilled to be working with them. Actually,
it's the other way around. Make em pay, I say.

JMHO
