bus boys sells them. I got mine by going up to owners of every bay window 
camper I saw with one on it and asking if it was for sale. I eventually got 
one for $20. stupid me, I didnt know the spring was supposed to be there and 
left it behind. anyone got measurements for one or can tell me where it 
connects to the bus?
