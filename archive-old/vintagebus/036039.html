&lt;&lt; Which style of mirrors is my '60 panel supposed to have? &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom, 
For the USA the bus came with a single round mirror from the factory 
according to VOA to dealer letters we have.  The mirror head was stored in a 
box inside of each bus along with an interesting list of stuff, including the 
tool kit.  Wish we could find out if the box itself looked like!
