Subject: Air-Cooled Volkswagen Junkyard

After reading Dave Rogge II's &quot;Cross Country&quot; trip report on the T2 
list, I stumbled over to check out Dave' web page, for no real reason.  
While I was there, I discovered a link to the &quot;Air-Cooled Volkswagen 
Junkyard...Where advice is always free.&quot;

This site is one of the reasons I made the leap and did not let my love 
for busses die with my 1976 Westy.  I read with great sadness the 
closing of the junkyard.

Are any of the folks responsible for this site active on the list?  
Does anyone know anything about them?  If so, I'd like to pass on a 
heart felt thank you.

peace,
mjr
