Subject: RE: [VB] Hard/No Starting - long


 The problem could be a combination of corroded 
connections and a hot starter. Bright lights counts out 
the bad battery or bad regulator. 
 Solenoids have plungers surrounded by coils of wire 
that push or pull when energized making a clunk or 
click. If you get nothing, either enough power isn't 
getting to the solenoid coils to activate the plunger or 
there's a problem in the solenoid. 
Has anyone taken apart a solenoid to see what goes bad 
and why heat seems to be the cause of intermittant 
operation? Open wires in the coil or physical blocking 
of the plunger? 
Anyway, clean the connections at the ignition switch AND 
the headlight switch. Feel the switches after power has 
been on to see if internal resistance (corrosion) makes 
them warm up. Replace or rebuild (see archives) the 
switch(es). Clean the connections at the starter, big 
and small, and at the battery. Park on hills on hot 
days! If the problem persists, replace the starter.
