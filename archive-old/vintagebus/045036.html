&lt;&lt; Hi Volks, 
 We are installing our choke cable in our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Need 
 to figure out where to drill the holes through the dog house fan shroud and 
 we do not have any 36HP shrouds at present location to use as a template.  
 Just a measurement from the top of the accelerator cable hole to the bottom 
 of the chole cable hole on the rear of the shroud should do the trick!   
 Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb

it is 1 3/4&quot; from center of acc cable hole to center of choke cable hole.  
the upper hole is slightly (1/8&quot;?) to the right.   this fan shroud is 
installed/with cables in bus, so hard to figure edge of holes sorry.
