Subject: Off road racing a barndoor
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

another Friday feature

In the July 1976 there is a story of Dave  Beeson  driving his 54 barndoor 
single cab in the Casino 350 mile off road race in Laughlin Nevada

Dave had a shop in Bellflower that you could see off the side of the 91 
freeway, He was good friends with Les Choat of Les's auto salvage.

I remember going over to his shop and thinking he was crazy (well he really 
was but thats another story)

and then there was the time that he got lost at an off road race - 2-3 days 
lost !!!!!

Anyone seen this beast in the last 20 years ?????
