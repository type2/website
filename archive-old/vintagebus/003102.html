I found an insurance card in the cab. It was insured in San
Diego to a guy named Charles Bentley.

There was writing all over the bus. I didn't check to see if
it was in weld bead or if someone used some thick acrylic
paint. Very interesting.

Wish I had a camera to take a picture. Would have made a
good post.

Hey Karl, can you post a photo of the doors?
