Subject: This year's Oktoberbus contest

In case I forgot, this year's contest entails decorating a rock.  Any 
rock.  As long as you can move it and don't leave it in the middle of 
the field when you leave.  You can glue stuff to it, paint it, crayon, 
whatever you want.  Only 1 (one) rock.  Bring it with you, find it here. 
doesn't matter.  You being stoned doesn't count!

Mad Uncle Dave
