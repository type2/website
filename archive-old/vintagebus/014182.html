&gt; &gt; Is there any way to electrically warm the water in
&gt; a particular vessel?  I
&gt; &gt; have a harbor freight parts washer, which uses a
&gt; water-based solition, and
&gt; &gt; if I could warm the water, it would be MUCH more
&gt; effective!

&gt; Thom,
&gt; Another option is one of those heating elements that
&gt; were used to start bbq.
&gt; Its about the same shape, but about 10x larger.

I used two of the BBQ starters in a full bathtub of
water at the deer cabin when the water heater went
out. Works like a charm:) Just hung em over the side
of the tub, emersed them in the water makin sure the
handle was an inch or two out of the water so the
connections wouldnt get wet, then just plug in:) in 20
or 30 minutes you would have a HOT, steamy bath ready.
CAUTION!!! not once did I get into the tub with em
plugged in. Even tho the element looked waterproof, &amp;
safe, and I wouldnt suggest it for anyone else either.
First heat the water, then unplug em to use the heated
water. Read the MSDS to determine if the solution your
heating is flammable, it will also have the flashpoint
of the solution on it...
Kids, dont try this at home...
