&gt; Hi Pat.
&gt; The dimmer switch on a 67 is you turn signal switch lever.


This is true, but....


 Pull back on
&gt; it and if you have your lights on you should hear the relay in your turn
&gt; signal switch box (the thing with a gajillion connections on top) go
&gt; CLICKclick.  The turn signal relay and the high beam all work from that
&gt; box.

This is NOT true.  There is a headlight dimmer relay which switches
between your headlights and your bright headlights. It is a separate unit
in a separate box.
