Subject: RE: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Empi and a couple other companies make the oil filter pump, but I don't
recall any &quot;O&quot; ring, only the regular thin paper gasket. I have a few of
these pumps, most for the pre 71 cam without the deep dish, and none of
them had an &quot;O&quot; ring. Maybe an Empi only mod to the basic pump?

Hi Ray,

This pump is a VW heavy duty pump made by Empi with a cover that has a
screw on filter attachment. There is a single circular slot in the pump
body that faces the pump cover. I put an O-ring that came with the pump
of equal size into this slot then bolted the cover on. I think maybe I
should have also included a thin paper gasket, hence the source of the
leak.

Are you saying that the O-ring should not have been used here? These
engines are so cool. If they aren't put together right, they will
usually let you know.

Dave
