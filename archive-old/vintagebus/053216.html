Subject: Re: [VB] Surface Rust

After sanding, I suggest using a product called &quot;Ospho&quot;. It's an inexpensive
and fairly easy to find &quot;rust-eliminator&quot; product. I've never searched for
anything else off the shelf, but I know this works. There are others, I
think, but definitely use a rust eliminator before primering.

Subject: [VB] Surface Rust


&gt; Last night I just got my '62 EZ Camper!!! I can't wait to dive in. I do
need
&gt; some constructive advice on getting the surface rust taken care of. In
&gt; general the bus is very straight. I have found only one square inch of
&gt; cancer rust on the drivers side dogleg! There is surface rust on the roof,
&gt; inside walls floor pan, edges, etc. What products would you suggest that I
&gt; use on the rust? Is there a process that works well? Web sites with tips?
I
&gt; was thinking that I would use phosphoric acid to start, then sand out the
&gt; rust spots and lastly spray primer over the spots and later on have it
&gt; painted professionally. Please let me know any successes or do's and don't
&gt; that you would suggest. I'd be stoked!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Joshua
&gt; '62 EZ
