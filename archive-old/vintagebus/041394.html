Do you have a big nut trans?  Ronnie sent me some for that that are for
IRS bug I think? to use on big nut setup.  I've had the same problem as
Thom.  It doesn't seem like
it would be that difficult to replace seals, but I've put in two and the
second leaks worse than the first.  On the second it sat for a day before
it started to leak.
