Subject: metal flakes in oil! Help!

Hi List,

     Hi, ok, heres the situation.  I have the 1500 sp that is in my 67 
beetle.  I am changeing the oil (had to drain the oil, was going to torque 
down my head bolts, there is a little bit of compression sneaking out 
between the jugs and the block, I assume on all jugs..., then I was going to 
change the oil but I didnt get that far).

Well, I go to clean the strainer, and find lots of metallic flakes and 
pieces, which are also in the waste oil.  The pieces are about a 32nd of an 
inch square, and some are like small fingernail clippings.  The amount that 
came out in the oil is about enough to fill a thimble, maybe two, maybe 
more......  I dont know if its magnetic or not, but I think it is magnesium, 
from the inside of the case.  Why do i think this, because I feel the motor 
may have over heated and caused it to flake off the inside.  Here:

1 Because the case is painted silver on the outside, which I now think may 
have helped in over heating it, and also, I think there is too much material 
for it to be regular bearing wear, (I assume).

2 Its a 67, with only the louvers above the decklid (maybe not enough 
cooling for what I use it for)

3 I was running the bug on a few trips, a couple hours in length, going 
approx. 65 mph.  It was slightly chilly and wet outside at he time.  (I dont 
run the bug over the winter, the oil is always adequate on the dipstick)


but heres a little bit of a kicker, the motor only has about 2000 mi. on it.


Now, what should I do?  I figured maybe do one of two things, not sure what 
order though:

1 take one of the heads/set of jugs off and inspect the amount, if any, wear 
on the cylinder (yes, I took the valve cover off, and there were small bits 
of metal there too), then:

2  place an oil filter on the motor and filter a batch of oil through it to 
remove as much metal as I can, and continue running the motor, if there isnt 
to much damage (but how much damage is to much?).


Other than the sound of the compression/exhaust slightly escapeing through 
the jug/block junction, the motor runs pretty good, you can only hear the 
problem when you start the motor up, and when under load (like trying to 
push it up hill in fourth gear)

I figured on trying one of the filters by:  CB Performance racing products, 
farmersville CA, mini sump filter, which was featured in VW trends, page 
68-69, (&quot;get additional protection&quot;) Jan 2002, (with the red conv on the 
front, &quot;Cool Factor&quot; issue.

in the next e-mail, I am going to ask questions about oil filters and 
pressure/temp, etc.

Anyone think of stuff I forgot to add, or have any questions I could answer 
to help make a better assecment?  (next e-mail will be sent in like 2 
hours....)

thanks you guys (and girls, ;)
my bug thanks you, and so do I
Matt, in Pa
