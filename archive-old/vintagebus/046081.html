Brad,
    There are several ways to deal with the creases, stud gun, dent master
come to mind.  We have these at work and the dent master is the cats pajamas.
Basically both tools work on the same principal.  A small metal rod welds
itself to the inside of the crease and as the rod is pulled the metal on the
sides of the crease are hammered down.  When you dent or crease metal there is
a rebound effect that leaves a high spot around the dent or on both sides of
the crease, sorta of a ridge.  The main trouble with creases is it is very
time consuming to get it all, even as good as I am :) .Plus location plays a
big part.  If theirs access behind the crease or dent the better job you can
do.  But with creases, chances are there is going to be a little body filler.
Body fillers have come a long way of the years and are mostly plastic now.
When non-lead type fillers first arrived in the mid sixties they where mostly
talc and clay and sucked water like a sponge.  The plastics of today don't do
that and a good repair will probably out live us.  But it is a good idea to
check with the shop your dealing with about a warranty.
     Peace, Love, and if it makes you feel better there are all metal fillers
out there-but the price goes up!
