&gt;
&gt;OK. So you may or may not remember, 1 1/2 weeks ago I had the lugnuts on
&gt;my front driver's tire back out and the wheel came off when I was driving
&gt;my '59 Kombi. [...] But now I find myself nervous and uncomfertable 
&gt;driving. I keep waiting for something to happen again. Having a wheel
&gt;come off was pretty intense...and I can't seem to shake it.

Along with all the other ideas, here's my suggestion.  Get a pad of
sticky notes or a little notebook and a pen.  Keep them in the Bus at
all times.  Every time you make a trip, even to the gas station and
back, write down your starting and ending odometer reading for the
trip, and figure the trip length.  Keep a list of the lengths on
another page in the book.  Title the list, &quot;Miles I have driven with
nothing at all happening with the wheels&quot; or similar.  Make sure to
do this for every trip and *write it down* - don't just keep the
lengths in your head.

I think seeing it in black and white will help.  It's there to refer
to when you feel nervous.  It helps give you proof that 99.99% of the
time you drive the Bus, nothing major happens.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
