Subject: Re: [VB] Identifying a genuine sundial conversion

Another reason to keep the roof vent, it could be put there by Sundial. 
Their brochure shows the roof vent as an option. My Sundial has one. My 
Sundial has the single pane camper windows though. They came both ways. 
I would look at the cutouts for the windows and the roof vent. If they 
look like the same level of craftsmanship, the bus is likely a Sundial.

Hi Eddie,
Kind of hard to tell from here, without an interior.  The best way to 
tell would be to find a Sundial in your area and see if the  cabinet 
mounting screw holes in the body are the same.    Suggest you keep the 
hole in the roof and replace the vent.  That really  does help keep the 
interior cooler in hot weather.
