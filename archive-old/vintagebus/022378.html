Took the day off from bus work and went to a little annual hot rod show
they have in town. Usually a lot of old ch*vy's and f*rds. My new VW buddy
took his bus down there and a really nice clean convertible bug showed up
too. They were right smack dab in the middle of all the old hot rods and
muscle cars. Very cool. Got lots of attention.

After that took a trip to my favorite little junk shop and scored a nice
little blue plastic split window pick-up truck toy that was made in Hong
Kong. Got it and 4 or 5 bug toys for $2.00!!!! SCORE!!! The truck looks
like it was a ladder truck or something, but is now missing the ladder.
Still cool though.
