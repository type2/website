Subject: Re: [VB] block heaters

Hey, if I can throw two cents in,
back in the late sixtys or early seventies J.C. Whitney was selling those 
heaters
for small bucks. As I recall there were two types. The kind that goes on the 
sump
plate and a type that goes into your oil dip stick hole. That type kept your 
oil warm like
those little heaters that boil a single cup of water for coffee. I purchased 
that type.
Thought it a little better then screwin' around with a piece of trash bolted 
to my sump plate.
On a day to day basis, what I found was unless you live above the artic 
circle someplace
you really don't need one. They do work and if you drive an ACVW in 
someplace with
winters like, say Minnesota, I suppose they could be handy. But in most 
milder climates as in
the lower 48, I found mine to be more trouble than its worth. As a side note 
let me add I purchased
that heater for a 1966 bug I bought new in that year while serving in the 
Navy in California. I served thirty
years in the navy and did almost twenty more civil service before 
retirement. Forty years later the
little bug sits in my garage, we still own and drive it. The block heater? 
It went &quot;deep six&quot; in the trash, many
years ago.

&gt;i have a nice canadian-made one that has a circular element that looks like 
&gt;a hot pot... you bolt it on to the OUTside of the sump plate.  i guess it 
&gt;makes it easier to remove; not sure how it affects heating ability.
