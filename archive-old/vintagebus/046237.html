David, these are still being offered by David Long, according his ad in the 
despised S.O.T.O. Newsletter (I don't know what THAT'S all about), by calling 
(562) 690-9416 after 9PM, or e-mail &lt;vwgeek_at_flashernet_dot_com&gt;.  Claims they're 
&quot;identical to stock,&quot; in either oak or ash, $125.  I made my own, and would 
say this is a good deal (but you might want to ask for a couple of 
references).  Good luck --John
