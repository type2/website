Subject: [VB] tie rod problems

i replaced my tie rods on my 66 about a month ago, the replacements have
locking nuts, the kind witht he plastic inside the nut, and not the hex
castelation type with a pin, if that makes a difference, anyway , when i
replaced them i did it with a puller i got at the flaps for $8, they called
it a ball joint puller, but it looked just like the one in the bently , i
did the job in 15 minutes it was great!, pop pop pop pop, tie rods were out,
nooooo problem, woohoo and all that.   Then i go to replace my spindles this
week and i cant get the rod of the passenger spindle, in fact i broke my
puller trying, and the drivers side, which came off easily was boogered and
i had to file it to get the nut on, i tried the muir method, and i tried
shocking it out by beating on the arm and the end while prying, well i ended
up bowing it a bit, i even tried a floor jack.   Anyway its stuck and i am
too, any suggestions? any reason why it is stuck?
