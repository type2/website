Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

I seriously doubt you will find 8 ply side walls..... you would probably break a tire machine 
trying to install them:)

Side walls come a one ply or two ply or reinforced.  It is the reinforced flavor you want.

The correct [VW recommended] size tire for your bus is 185R14. You will notice there is no 
middle number. The middle number is the aspect ratio. The tread is shown as being x number 
of millimeters wide. The aspect ratio is shown expressed in a %. When no aspect number is
given, it is 82.

If your tire 'expert' says there is no such thing as a 185R14 and you meant to say 185/75R14,
run away.

The 195 tire is not actually taller. It has a /75 in it. So it would be 195/75R14.

If you go here:  http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html
And put in 185 80 [no 82 choice] 14 on the left and 195 75 14 on the right, you will see that the
195/75 is .5% faster. The 195 tire is actually .2&quot; smaller in diameter.

I'm just going to go on about tires what I'm learning-looking for
corrections or agreement on these statements.
 
I notice in my bus when driving on the highway-and a truck passes me-the
whole bus sways. So I think I want to go with a stiffer sidewall. I think
the current tire I have are wrong. Poor tire shop recommendation. They are
one ply sidewall.
 
According to the library I should be looking for a tire with a weight rating
in the 1500-1700 lbs range. And 4-ply sidewall. I could get either 185 or
195. I guess 195 is a little taller-this would give me better mileage,
right? Is there a big difference between these two-in terms of ride or any
other factor? Are there potential problems with the larger tire having
trouble fitting? I think I read that a larger tire(larger than OEM
recommendation) can cause extra stress on the steering box.

I think I want a pair of all-season, as I don't think I can be bothered with
changing my tires every winter/summer.

I used Ronnie's suggested search on Tirerack_dot_com, and only two show up as
all-season-the Continental Vanco-8($66) or the Michelin Agilis($101).
According to some tests the Hankook outperforms the Michelin. Hankook is not
available on Tirerack.
 
I checked the specs on the Bridgestone Dueler A/T D693 w/UNI-T(on tire
rack)[recently suggested by some list-members]-they are only rated for 1435
lbs. I think that this sidewall has two-plys. 
 
The Continental Vanco 8 gets a load rating of 1874 lbs, (they are also made
in germany ;). I'm not sure how many sideplys they have. This has also
gotten some rave reviews on Tirerack from VW bus owners. Price $66
 
The Michelin Agilis is rated at 1875 lbs. good reviews by Vanagon owners on
Tirerack. A bit pricier.
 
The Hanook RA08 has is rated 8ply-I'm not sure if that is side ply or not.
If so-I imagine this is a very stiff tire. Price - $105 locally, or $70 from
bus depot, N/A from tirerack.
