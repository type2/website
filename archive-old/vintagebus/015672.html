NQ,

If I were in your shoes (and trust me, I have been
when it come to electrical stuff), do yourself a big
favor and get a few things to make sure this fix lasts
until you replace the wiring harness.  Get a hair
dryer or heat gun - heat gun being the better choice. 
Alo, get some shrink tubing (I recommend individual
pieces for each wire, there aren't that many) and some
of the paint-on rubber stuff.  Any decent marine store
will have all this stuff.  If you want to be extra
sure, get a large diameter piece of shrink tubing to
go over the whole ball of wax.  First, put the large
shrink tubing on first.  Then put the smaller pieces
on the individual wires.  Solder up all the
connections, and use flux paste since you're doing the
job right.  Wait for it to cool, then slide the small
shrink tubing on, shrinking each piece separately if
possible.  Then slide the large piece of shrink tubing
on and shrink it.  Then seal the whole mess with the
paint-on rubber stuff. Eastwood Company has the stuff,
I think it's called &quot;Liquid Electrical Tape&quot; and runs
about 6 or 7 dollars for a jar of it.  The stuff I
have in in cans about the size and appearance of PVC
glue.  It works wonders.  I have used this stuff on
just about everything I do where electrical wires are
exposed to the elements, and I have never had a
problem.

Good luck and keep the enthusiasm up!
