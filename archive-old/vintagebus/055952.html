Subject: RE: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler

I've used the german one marked Ernst. The muffler fit well,, but the
tailpipe braket has a gap between the tab and the tab that attaches to
the muffler itself. The side bracket (worked ok)  and tailpipe looks
correct. It was aquired as an entire kit through the busdepot_dot_com .

Subject: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler


Hi All,

I'm succumbing to the notion that I may have to put a non og muffler on
the tipper if I ever hope to get it on the road again.  Please don't
think less of me....... well, ok, I may have found an NOS 1500, VW
stamped muffler but just in case it doesn't pan out I need a backup
plan.

I've poked around on the internet and have found a number of *German*
1500 mufflers ranging anywhere from $62 at WW to $49 from Larry Reno at
wagenwerks.  Can anyone tell me who's *german* fits better or are they
all the same manufacturer?

.... then again, maybe someone will make my day and tell me they have a
good used 1500, VW stamped 1500 muffler?
