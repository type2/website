&gt;Just curious. Why do you have to go to a &quot;VW&quot; shop to get body work &gt;done?

That's a good question, Steve.  I took my bus to a shop here in town and 
they did a wonderful job.  You really need to make sure the guys know what 
they're doing, however.  Most shops aren't accustomed to doing restorations. 
  I showed them the places I needed repaired and gave them the panels I 
ordered for it.
I think what the guys are talking about when they say a 3.5 year wait is for 
a complete restoration.  Would these VW body shops do all your wiring, 
engine work, and all misc. work as well?  I mean, the VW enthusiast should 
be able to do this all their selves!  That's the whole fun of it.
