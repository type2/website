this bus is very straight, (walk through) only a bad nose repair job, that
needs to be redone, front floors perfect and has a little rust in the cargo
area. Headliner has 3 small tears but can be patched, body work was started
very miner, all jail bars, rear carpet, cargo mat, middle seats available,
bay or correct (extra cost, these are out of my parts), front bumper, no
rear, new original style seat covers on front seats, would need lower paint,
this bus would make a good total resto, or just clean up and drive, 


ronnie

ps. this bus belongs to a customer would ran into some personal problems and
needs to sell, 2500.00
call for more info  520   680-7664, this is an original AZ bus.
