I was looking at some extra white shift knobs I had laying around this weekend
and I noticed one is white and one is more of an ivory.  Different years,
Bus vs. Bug, or ?  I thought they were all just white...  the price I pay
for only paying attention to commericals.  ;)

Anybody have one of those shift knobs with the little shift pattern in it?
 I'd like one.

Thanks,
Everett
