 &lt;&lt; Eric, 
  Just went and got a oil temp sender from a FLAPS and didn't look too 
closely 
 at
  the terminal end.  To my surprise it was not a spade terminal but a weird 
 looking round top with a conical shaped middle.  It looks like a child's toy 
 top.  Any idea how to wire this up?  Do you solder the wire to the sender? &gt;&gt;
 Hi Steve,
 A real shocker is it not!  Do not worry you are just not looking at the 
 problem the correct way.  Take the female spade connector in hand and with 
 the side that has the two curled and the center slot on it will face 
downward 
 toward the sender.  Then slid the female connector onto the side of that toy 
 top protrubance.  Voilla!  Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;

ya- I had no idea what to do with that connection when I first saw it too.   
Sideways thinking? 

Clara
