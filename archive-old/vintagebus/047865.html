 Here is the response I got from Bentley.  It looks like we got their
 attention, but we still need to show a larger support base.  As of this

well that covers buses from ch.469506 through  1 144 xxx, so about 675,000 
buses.  There have to be much more than 400 left driven around by people who 
want the book.
