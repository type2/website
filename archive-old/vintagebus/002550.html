So it seems as if Winnipeg may just be the early bus capital of Canada - or
at least Manitoba.  I saw a very cool 57 last week a few blocks away - very
cool bus though admittedly is was a little rough.  It had a very nice roof
rack and was some sort of dark green over a little green or grey maybe.  It
was missing a rear bumper and I wanted to tell the owner of one I know of on
a chicken coop/storage shed bus on the outskirts of town but I couldn't find
him and now the bus is gone - too bad for him.

And now there as a 61 panel about 8 or 10 blocks away the looks like it is
in for a resto job - I looked at it when for sale and boy is it rough - but
it does have a gas heater installed under the drivers seat.

About a month ago I was walking my dog and I saw a bus drive by - Wow says
I.  Then as I was just getting home I saw that it was at a body shop on the
main drag that my street leads to.  So I went over and talked to the owner -
it was a 63 or 64 and he didn't have a driver's side door handle.  I had a
spare so I offered it too him of course he rapidly accepted - it seems that
his door was off an earlier bus and my door handle would work - but it was
broken inside as I had pulled out the broken piece of mine and replaced it
with ...... anyway, he said he had a spare 12 light switch - yip pee - but I
still don't have it yet.

Ok, Ok, no big deal for all of you big shots with dozens of buses - but here
in central canada where the winters last 7 months per year seeing 3 buses in
the neighbourhood in a month is a big deal (at least to me).
