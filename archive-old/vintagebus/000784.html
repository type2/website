&lt;&lt; Hi E&amp;B,
   Got a quick question I'm sure you can ansewer. I just bought a 66 Deluxe 
bus, but it has 14&quot;  rims up front and 15&quot; rims in back. They looked just 
alike until I looked at the size tires on each rim. For lack of better 
description, both sizes have the four flat areas just outside of where the 
hubcap fits. So can you tell me what is correct for this year and also what 
years use what sizes ?  &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Up to chassi # 20-117 901 (MAR55) the rim size was 3.5 D x 16&quot;.
&gt;From chassi # 20-117 902 up to 1 219 510 (About NOV63?) the rim size was 4.5 
K x 15&quot;.
&gt;From chassi # 1 219 511 on up the rim size was 5 JK x 14&quot;.
Only M215 buses used the 14&quot; rims before chassi # 1 219 511.
