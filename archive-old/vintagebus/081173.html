Subject: Re: [VB] Perhaps a dumb questuon

I also agree with eric and barb, as well, but it seems as if the poster
needs it done shortly, and taking an engine, let alone a tranny out the
first time, can be harrowing, considering they don't know what tools, or
*optimum* tools to have there to grab. Plus all the questions that will
arise concerning various sub-procedures. If they have lots of time, then I
agree, it's an incredibly empowering experience to stand there looking at
your engine and tranny laying in the driveway, and even more so, when it's
all back in the bus and you're running down the road the first time.
(been there, done it, and about to do it all again next month!!!).

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; Do it!  It should take alot less than an hour to pull the engine, one to
&gt; remove the tranny, and another hour to remove the RGBs and axles.  Heck even if it
&gt; takes you a whole day, we have never been paid $200.00 working for one day!
