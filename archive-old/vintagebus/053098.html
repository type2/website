Subject: Re: 59 westy FSRe: [VB] 62' bus question

FWIW the Old Cars Price Guide says that your '59 Westy has a ballpark
value of $2450 for 'needs complete restoration (may or may not be
running)' down to $800 for a 'parts car'.  According to their
statistics, 1957-1967 VW campers in need of complete resto are all in
the $2300 to $2650 range in value.  Prices come from a compilation of
national/regional data and include collector-car auctions, input from
experts, and verified reports of private sales.  YMMV.  B^)

&gt; I got a 59 westfalia flip top about a year ago and haven't done a thing to
&gt; it.  clear title, rolls, no motor, pretty complete interior (not sure if it
&gt; has clamshells), typical Wa rust (front floors, rockers bad) straight, bad
&gt; split case tranny (DPO cut off input shaft for clutch alignment tool)  In the
&gt; interest of more space in the back shed I'd be willing to let it go to a good
&gt; home for less than that value of $2650. could throw in a core motor if you
&gt; like.  Needs restoration.  that really neat interior with the wood cabinets
&gt; and metal trim on them.  In W WA state.

&gt;  FWIW the 'Old Cars Price Guide' pegs the ballpark value of a '62 camper
&gt;  bus in need of a 'complete restoration (may or may not be running)' as
&gt;  $2650.  This is a car which is essentially all there and not wrecked.
&gt;  For comparison, a '62 standard in similar condition is valued at $2450.
&gt;  The next lowest rating category is for 'parts car' at $800-900.
