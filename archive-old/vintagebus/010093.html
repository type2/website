As George suggests, the small bullet connectors are probably the simplest
solution in this case since the insulating tubing will not be disturbed by
opening and reclosing the connection.

Another alternative is the interlocking knife type connectors.  These are
also quite small, but an insulating sleeve would have to be
moveable/slideable to allow opening and reconnecting.  These connectors are
common in marine applications, particularly outboard motors.  They are
virtually vibration proof, durable, and make excellent connections because
of the large area of contact between the components.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  You might try bullet connectors such as those used on Japanese cars.
The male part is quite small and may fit through the hole in the body,
particularly if you use heat-shrink tubing to insulate it.  Use
heat-shrink over the whole female part and it too will be completely
insulated so that you can keep the connector inside the body.  &lt;&lt;
