Subject: Re: [VB] '61 Panel Emergency Fuel Shutoff

Hi Mike,
Section K-4, pages 1 through 5, covers all of that in the 1963-67 Workshop 
Manual Volkswagen Transporter.
  We are using a 1968-71 bus gas tank and the switch works fine in these.  
Make sure to cut off or work out with pliers the short brass tube to lessen the 
water trap in the bottom of the tank, which rusts out the tank.  It is alot 
easier to drain off water at the carb, with much less corrosion problems.  
  Before installing the valve, remove the cable from its sheath.  Polishing 
with sand paper and greasing so the cable will slide in the sheath.  This 
greasing has to be done even to new cables!  Doing this to our OG cable in the 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion made the swithing from a two handed 
struggle to one hand ease for Barb.
