Bug o rama was fun, found a few cool things but its a smaller show then 
May.....

almost had a riot in the &quot;Ghetto&quot; oh I mean swap area.....

at 1 am loud yelling  , screaming one guy got beat up.....too much 
drinking.....this went on for 10 minutes

yeh I know there is no drinking allowed.....what a joke.....

no securtiy ever showed up........makes you wonder what would happen if  you 
called 911 and the cops showed up to a locked gate !!!!!

the last  3 bug o ramas  have had loud  fights at night by drunks, seems to 
be the place to party away from the cops, but it stops being  a family type 
event.....

one guy was drunk off his ass on Sunday walking up and down the swap area, 
but no security seemed to care........This was a seller who  gets blasted 
there every show.......

I hate to have it turn into the &quot;ghetto&quot; like the cars for sale area at 
Pomona. lots of people will not park their cars overnight there 
anymore........too scary...

lots of nice buses and lots of piles, but it was fun seeing them getting some 
use.......

see ya there next May.....
