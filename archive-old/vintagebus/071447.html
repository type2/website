&gt; If big oil lines are bad, and small oil lines are better, then why not run
&gt; 1/4&quot; lines, or better yet, 1/8&quot; lines.  ;-)

What is the purpose of small lines in a brake system ???

 &gt; Like George said, if you push X amount of oil into one end of the oil
line,
&gt; then the exact same amount of oil will come out the other side. Oil line
&gt; size does NOT change this.

&quot;What goes in must come out&quot;. Einstein ? Dr.Spock ?

 &gt; Now, the speed at which the oil travels through the oil line will change
&gt; with oil line size, but, regardless of oil line size, once the oil line
taps
&gt; back into the main galley, the oil speed is the same.

Speed vs. flow vs. pressure - Back to Pascal / Bernouli.
Something happens when the hose size changes, but
it does eventually get back to the case oil galley bore.
How fast is sludge ?

 &gt; If an engine is suffering from low oil pressure, it is, without a doubt,
not
&gt; from an oil line being too large. Low oil pressure is a result from worn
&gt; main, rod, or cam bearings (usually rod bearings), using a cast iron pump
&gt; instead of aluminum which allows air to get sucked into the pump between
the
&gt; case and the pump, or a loose oil pump pickup tube in the case.

Melling pumps are cast-iron. They expand at a different rate.
Do they last longer than an aluminum pump ?
The case has a tolerance for the pump bore size. It is
70.00-70.03mm ( 2.7559-2.7570 ).
So, even a new case can be +/- .0011 loose.
Oil pumps are manufactured to even looser tolerances.
Berg has a solution for that. They machine a groove
for an o-ring on the pump body.
Then there's the question of blueprinting the pump and cover.
If you shave the pump to .002 and then add a paper gasket,
what exactly is the proper clearance ? Why can't this be
provided by the manufacturer ? German pumps did.
