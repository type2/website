Subject: [VB] Bus Bus Lowering


&gt; Bus Boys of Northern CA sells a lowered beam for Buses.  In order to
balance
&gt; the look they recommend, among others, the use of a 68 Type 1 transmission
&gt; for its durability in conjunction with their rear suspension kit.  I
believe
&gt; a Type 3 trans from a 68 is the other but I would have to look that up.
&gt; Anyway, I am not saying I intend lowering my 62 Deluxe but since we have a
&gt; thread on the subject and I happen to have a 68 Type 1 tranny assembly I
am
&gt; curious on the Lists opinions, sans flames, on this.  My son and I have
some
&gt; interesting exchanges on advantages/disadvantages in doing this and I
would
&gt; love to hear from the rather extensive experience points on the List :-)
