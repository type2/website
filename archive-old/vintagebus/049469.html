Subject: cheap carbon monoxide detector
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My brother got me a neat little CO detector for Xmas -  no batteries, no
beeping, no white plastic box the size of a phone book on the dash... but
it works for me.
The size of a credit card, it has a little button that turns from gray to
black as the CO concentration goes up. The back has magnetic and sticky
pads on it, so you can place it where you like.
I put mine right on the vent above the gas pedal and drove around for
awhile... no color change = no leaks!!!
I can see it from the driver's seat quite well, and if any place is gonna
have a strong concentration, the vent is it :)

Made by Quantum Group, phone 800-432-5599, costs about $10. No connection,
etcetcetc.
