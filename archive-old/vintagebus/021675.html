Subject: needed: center divider panels for a 67 deluxe
Message-ID: &lt;273e1479.24b9b593_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Will pay any reasonable price for a complete set of the center divider panels 
for behind the front 1/3 2/3 bench seat. Also looking for Grab handles for 
full length middle seat, the kick panels for both rear seats and armrests.
