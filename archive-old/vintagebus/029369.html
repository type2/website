Amen to those who've suggested the U.S. gas-price whiners need to
revisit their logic textbooks.  Before this thread gets killed, let me
put in my two teaspoons' worth:

The petroleum that my bus runs on is in limited supply.  Blame the
A-rabs for limiting &quot;production&quot; if you want; what are they going to
sell when their wells run dry?  Sand?  Besides, the &quot;cartel&quot; isn't
limited to the Persian Gulf.  Look south.

Al Gore ain't the only one who doesn't want oil platforms in the Gulf of
Mexico -- I don't either.  MANY people don't.  Sorry, folks; convenience
-- and even avoidance of a little hardship -- is no excuse for trashing
the environment.  Even if it does give me a few more years to drive my
bus.  Folks, get ready for this let's-eat-our-seed-corn argument over
and over again as our wasteful ways lead to more shortages.  The angry
mobs are gonna be wanting what *you* have, too.  It's not an issue of
national self-sufficiency.  When has *that* ever stopped us from
trumping up a reason to invade and take over?

(Aside, I hear people talking about Gore's and Nader's antipathy toward
the automobile like it was heresy, treason, and perversion all rolled
into one.  Whispered like some dirty secret.  What, these people think
autos have been a BOON to this planet?  Well, yeah, my Ghia, but the
rest of them?)

Gas prices are *artificially low* in the U.S.  Europeans pay a more
realistic price, given the auto's known impacts on air quality and its
need for infrastructure -- and the fact that petroleum is in limited
supply.  I can whine about the fact that if I drive my bus 20 miles to
Georgia, it's 20% cheaper due to differential taxation -- but only 20%? 
Given all that the auto has done to Florida, gas oughta be $5.00 a
gallon here.  Ten dollars.

Complain if it makes you feel good.  I know I do! :-)
