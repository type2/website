&lt;&lt; I have heard a lot of feedback about the freeway flier tranny.  Is this a 
brand name?&gt;&gt;
Hi DJ,
It is a generic term for a tranny with a 3.875 ring &amp; pinion.  Instead of the 
pre-1968 stock bus 4.125, 4.375, or even lower R&amp;Ps.  

&lt;&gt;
Hmm, we find that most folks who say this have not realized that thier third 
gear in the freeway flier now covers almost the same RPM/MPH area that the 
old stocker fourth gear did.  Third in the freeway flier with the 1964-67 
reductions is only 2-3 MPH lower at 3,000 RPM as the 1960-63 stocker tranny 
with it's stock reductions.  The freeway flier compared to the late part of 
1964-67 tranny is about 10-11 MPH lower MPH at 3,000 RPM so it actually 
climbs better than the stocker fourth.   The freeway flier fourth in essence 
becomes a fifth gear.  We are looking forward to see how Steven G.'s new 3.44 
R&amp;P tranny does.  It might be the way to go by moving up the third and fourth 
gears just a bit more.  Allowing the use of smaller diameter rear tires to 
attain the same high MPH at lower RPMS as the 3.875 R&amp;P with larger rear 
tires.  This would be very helpfull for our pre-late 1962 buses that have the 
lower, thinner rear wheel wells that do not allow bigger radial tires than 
205/75R15 to be used.

&lt;&lt;Well, Florida is as flat as this country gets but I do like to cruise in 
the mountains at least once a year (more often if work allows).  Is it just 
plain bad in mountainous terrain or just not good for continuos use in 
mountainous terrain?   &gt;&gt;
We drive to almost every Sacramento meet in the spring, and fall from the 
Seattle area.  The Syskious (SP?) Mountians in N. Cal are rather steep, and 
long.  We have found the need to downshift out of third on only three of the 
slopes going through there with a fully loaded camper interior, and a fully 
loaded pair of short roof racks!  This with 215/75R15 radials on the rear, 
and a 1641cc SP engine cruising along about 63 MPH while getting 25+ average 
MPG on this 1400 mile trip.
