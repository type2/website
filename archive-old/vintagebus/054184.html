Subject: Re: [VB] More Drivers Training Fun

Scott,

I learned to drive in my bus. They are a great training ground.
Especially in San Francisco with all those hills. Learned to hook my
front wheels over the top of hills at at stop light to keep from
rolling back. See if your daughter can do this in Signal Hill.
Yuck Yuck.

Chris
The Steering Man.

&gt; Theresa, my 16yo daughter has been regularly driving my '60 DC, and
has
&gt; stepped it up over the last month.  Been watching her skills
increase on
&gt; a daily basis, no more wishing for the nonexistent passenger side
grab
&gt; handle.  :-)
&gt;
&gt; One result of all the &quot;truck driving&quot; is that when she gets into my
&gt; wife's bmw, she becomes SuperDriver.
&gt;
&gt; Today, we finally got her '71 SB together, carb tuned and brake
lights
&gt; working.  We jumped in and went for a spin w/me driving just to make
&gt; sure all systems were go after our extensive list of work over the
last
&gt; few weeks.  Steering checked out fine, brakes great, suspension
hmmm...,
&gt; then tried it on the hwy and these things, get up and go!  We pulled
&gt; over and she spend the next couple of hours driving her car around
for
&gt; the first time.  Of course she had to drop by some of her friends
&gt; places, then finally home.
&gt;
&gt; Next friday, she has an appointment for her driver's test.  I guess
I
&gt; feel fairly safe with her driving after having all those hours
behind
&gt; the double cab.  Learn in something hard, then the rest is a piece
of
&gt; cake?
&gt;
&gt; Scott
&gt; '60 DC
