I will be selling my daily driver DC at the Bug-O-Rama this weekend. I will
camp in a swap spot from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon. The DC is in
above average shape but not show quality. It has a very strong 1600Sp,
aluminum side step, good tires, interior good seats, small 2&quot;&quot; tears in
headliner, poor gates, needs a new steering box. I just painted this bus
after removing a 3&quot;X5&quot; spot of rust on the passenger side rocker, not a
great paint job but I get compliments whenever I stop the bus. I did not fix
the gates since this is currently being used as a work truck. E-mail any
questions.
