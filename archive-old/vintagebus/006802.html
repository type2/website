Lenny at West Coast Classics, TMI doesn't have the correct color gray

ronnie

ps. also Doug at Upholstery Haus, I think he found the correct gray material
for those.

pss, do you have the wide driver seat or the one with the weird mount on the
side of the pedestal


psss, it shouldn't have any piping and if your not vintage n#_at_i about the
material, TMI can make the covers they just don't list it.


pssss, I just ordered seat covers for my 61 sideloader, no piping, gray
vinyl sides with gray tweed insert (it's hot here)

Can anyone suggest where I can find original style bucket seat upholstery
for 
1961 bucket seats, preferrably grey?  I have looked through TMI and they
seem 
to supply &gt;1962. 
Thanks,
