Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shocks????

I know what you mean.  they gave you fronts for a bug.  those have a pointy 
up stud that goes through a hole then a nut &amp; washer goes on.  That's what my 
69 bugster has at least.  The rears for the bug were the same as all around 
on the 55-67 bus - eyes both top and bottom.  (I like the KYB GR-2s)   But 
for the BD I had to get a dif size (smaller ) for the front (still eyes top 
and bottom though) , and the rears are lever shocks.  Most places are not 
very familar with split buses.    Maybe the guy who wrote down the order 
thought you said &quot;bug&quot;, or just wrote down the wrong thing.  They sent you 
the wrong shock.

&lt;&lt; OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks from a Bus parts 
company.  The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom and a stud top 
(that goes through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to tell them they 
sent the wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a 57 to 67 Bus.  
They tell me what I received is the correct shock for a 67 Bus.  My 66 has a 
shock that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me that they've sold 
1000's of these shock and had none returned.  So if this is the correct 
shock.  What's going on with my frontend?  The picture in the Bently shows a 
shock with eyelits on both ends.  They tell me the Haynes shows the shock on 
67 like the one they sent me.  
 
 This is in no means to slam anyone.  I had a big order that was received 
fast and everything else was there.  I'm just confused on how this shock fits 
a Splitwindow Bus.
