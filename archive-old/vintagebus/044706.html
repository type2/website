When I first was getting back into busses after a long (extremely long) 
hiatus, I heard of SOTO and sent off a little money (very little) for a 
sample magazine.  I never heard from these jerks again.

I ran into the SOTO booth at the Denver Bandimere Raceway show a year or two 
later, and asked if they had any sample publications, and was told &quot;we just 
ran out&quot;.
These F*%_at_kers just lied to me all the way, and if anybody can explain to me 
why I should give them any consideration for the way they run their &quot;club&quot;, 
please do so.

Someone suggested recently on the list that one individual was doing 
everything by himself, and had no help, well tough s&amp;*t;  he took my money 
under false pretenses.

I will never in my life attend a SOTO show, no matter how well attended.  I 
feel that I have a lot of friends in the VW bus hobby, but none have ever 
treated me as badly as these people.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest (it is still Friday).

JP
