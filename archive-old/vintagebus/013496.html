It is Friday, isn't it?  I don't know with my weird schedule.

Here is an article my friend gave me from a local paper and I was wondering peoples reactions to it.  It would be cool if everyone wrote in and set these guys straigh.

Does anyone have any info or personal experiences of people ending up legless after bus accidents?  In my experience seeing buses that have been in accidents, they have held up well, even in head on collisions.  I would be more afraid of being in a small plastic car and getting hit from the side or a pickup truck flipping over.  I've seen buses rear end pickups at 50 MPH, hit cows, cadi1acs, and Yugos head on and end up back on the road (except for the Cadi1ac).  Just curious if I was the only one offended by this article.

DEAR TOM AND RAY: I was thinking of buying a Volkswagen Microbus. I know that means constant repairs, etc. But I  currently drive 
a 1987 Jetta with 166,000 miles that also needs constant repairs. So I figured if I'm going to be  repairing my car all the time, I might as 
well have a cooler vehicle, l'm graduating from high school soon, and I plan on going to college next year. What do you think?	-- Nick 
RAY: Well, if you're looking for a cooler vehicle, you can't beat an old VW Microbus. Their heaters were so inefficient that you're 
guaranteed ·to be cool all winter -- assuming you don't freeze to death.	 
TOM: Of course, the major downside of the VW Microbus is not its lack of a good heater. It's not its lack of power, either. Nor is it the 
way it blows around in the wind like a billboard on top of MountWashington. No, the big problem with Microbuses is safety. 
RAY: Before you buy one, try this experiment, Nick. Take a folding chair out to your driveway and have a friend drive his car into your 
knees. That'll give you an idea of what it will feel like to have a front-end crash in an old VW bus. The engine's in the back. And you sit so 
far up front in that vehicle that vour knees basically are the front bumpers. 
TOM: So if you really want a  VW bus, at least get a Eurovan, the later-generation, front-engine, front-wheel-drive VW bus. Those are 
considerably safer. 
RAY: Or if you want something old and funky, consider going for something big -- like a '70s Chevy Suburban or my brother's late '74 
Chevy Caprice Classic convertible.  Something like that will be every bit 
as lousy, smelly and unreliable as a VW bus, but at least there will be a lot of metal around you if you should hit something.
