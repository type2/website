Subject: Re: [VB] stuck motor?

Remove the rocker shafts from the cylinder heads.
Place a ruler across the valve stems.

Also check the carb throat for a missing squirter.
If it's gone, turn that engine upside down and shake it
out the spark plug hole. Or use a brass magnet:)

Subject: [VB] stuck motor?


&gt; The motor was at TDC, and wouldn't go any further
&gt; clockwise. I can rotate almost all the way around
&gt; counter clockwise -- maybe 350 degrees, but then it
&gt; &quot;thunks&quot; to a stop again. Then I can rotate it back
&gt; around clockwise to TDC, and get another &quot;Thunk&quot;, and
&gt; it won't go any further. Any ideas as to what could be
&gt; the problem?
