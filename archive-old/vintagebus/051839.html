Subject: Re: steering wheel colors

OK,

The REAL reason I ask this is 'cuz I have two gray ones. One has cracks 
and needs a resto (the finish and composition is nice, just the normal 
amount of cracks). The other one is close to show quality - original non 
resto, but one (very small) chip and marks that will probably clean up 
once I get on it.

But, from the responses it sounds like my 65 Deluxe came with pearl 
white (ivory). And that's what I'll shoot for. Thanks very much for your 
responses.

Thanks,
Conrad

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Generally, deluxes were pearl white (but not necessarily) and deliveries
&gt; were black. I have never seen any other original colors. Not sure if
&gt; interior color dictated wheel color.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe someone else on the list knows.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was told that black steering wheels belonged to commercial vans, that
&gt;&gt; sounds right. But did all Deluxes come ONLY with ivory wheels? What
&gt;&gt; about gray wheels - were they were pickups?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How do you know what the correct color was for your bus? Should a
&gt;&gt; certain interior color dictate what color wheel you got?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Where there any other colors? I thought I saw a cocoa color one once.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Conrad
