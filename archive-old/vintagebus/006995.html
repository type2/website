They had the Adam 12 weekend run special this weekend and in one of them the
boys from 1 Adam 12 pulled over a tannish late 50's bus with cut wheel
wells, decklid flopping in the wind, etc, could this have been the long lost
Manson bus making a scene in the movies.


ps, the driver did have the vintage hippy look and some cool Peter Max style
grafics on the side of the bus.
