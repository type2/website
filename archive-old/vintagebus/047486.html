Hi Eric,
Unless your engine has an aftermarket sand seal, VW just used a oil slinger 
washer and the threads on the lower pulley OD to pump the oil back in.  If 
these OD thread is clogged or damaged the oil will leak out.  Also check you 
breather tube to the aircleaner to make sure it is not clogged with a ugly 
mayonase like oil/water mix which will cause the blow by in the engine to 
find other places to make it's way out!  If clogged this is a sign the engine 
is not reaching proper operating temp of at least 180F (Check or install your 
thermostatic flaps/bellow system!).  If all else is working properly then the 
oil leakage is probably a sign of badly worn rings.   Eric&amp;Barb
