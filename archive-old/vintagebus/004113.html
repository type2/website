I looked at that ebay add and noticed in the fine print they are actually an
arcade sales shop. I went to their site and saw a small picture of a game
called TRANSPORTER. Anyone ever seen that one? is it a bus game? The have
one called CORVETTE so im wonderin if it is actually a bus game. We could
only be so lucky :) perhaps the ballys designer owns a VW.
look in the bottom right corner -

&gt;&gt;In a student lounge at the university I work
&gt;&gt;at there is a pinball machine with a split window bus in it.
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately the pinball game is called Junk Yard.
