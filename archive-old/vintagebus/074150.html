Subject: Re: [VB] Warming up a cold engine....

similar topic, but sort of different.  I decided to run a couple buses that I don't drive very often today.   

I have a 67 kombi, I had to charge the battery a tad, then it started up.   let it run a few minutes at idle, there was water coming out the exhaust pipe. then put a chunk of wood on the gas pedal to keep it ~ 2000 rpms, and let it do that for about half an hour.   I figure this keeps it all oiled up, and dries any moisture out of the system.  Gotta replace the pre-heat hose on it I stole out of it for the 65.

I don't know why I have this 67 bus, it will be for sale soon.  

Then I cranked the 53's engine round by hand to pre oil it, then started it up.   the manual choke on the motor is really nice, so I had that on high a couple minutes, then bumped it down to barely on.  after a few more minutes I turned the choke off all the way, and set it ~2k rpms with the ubiquitous piece of wood.  let it run for half an hour while I futzed with stuff in the garage.  water dripped of the intake, it has no pre heat system.  
In fact, there is a lovely quote in the early workshop manual about how they don't need no steekin preheat!!!  I guess VW changed their minds about that.

We had over 4 inches of rain here Monday.   It is soggy.
