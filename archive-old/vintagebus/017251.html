Isiah,

Do yourself a favor and keep looking for a shop that specializes in older car restoration.  The last thing you want to do is take it to a production body shop.  You want someone that has at least done a few bus rockers and front valances before, or at least has see a few cut apart.  Ask Thom about how complex the front lower part of a bus is.  Nothing too hard, but you don't want the person to just slap it back together when they figure out they are in too deep.  Check out the Metwiz page for looks at what it takes to repair rockers and other parts of a bus.

If you do decide to use this shop (I'm not saying this place is not reputable) be sure that you expect certain things to be done at certain points in time.  For example, get in writing when you expect them to finish the rocker replacement, when you expect the front end to be finished, when the prep is to be finished, etc.  Put in the contract that payment is subject to your approval of the completed task!  If you don't approve, they don't get their money.  Also get in writing that only when each step is completed will payment be given (for that particular step).  Get everything in writing and to your satisfaction before you sign on the dotted line.  Make notations in the contract about the type of paint (single stage or two stage...base/clear), maker of paint, and maker of all supplies that will be used.  Make sure that all of the paint products will be from ONE manufacture!  This is very important...more so than the particular maker.  Different makers products don't all work with each other.  BTW, you want a two part catalyzed urethane paint.  This is far superior to enamel and is well worth the cost.

Ask if the price will include color sanding and buffing, or is this an extra cost.  Most single stage paints will need to be sanded and buffed, while some people will leave the two stage paints un buffed.

Don't worry about offending the shop.  This is standard contract procedure and should be readily acceptable to a reputable shop.  It also keeps them on a proper time line and keeps them from pushing your project farther and farther into the future.  Anything they discussed with you in person should be put into writing, if those are the things you want done.  Most of all, do not pay anything up front. 

One last thing.  Be an active owner...almost a pest but a really nice one.  Stop by unannounced every week or so..it keeps them on their toes.  You can take pics and show us all the progress.  Good luck.

Steve
