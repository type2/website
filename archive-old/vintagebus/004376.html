Subject: Engine Bay Clean up
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 20:54:42 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I'm cleaning out my engine bay to por-15 it and I have a couple
questions.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I should treat those parts of my
engine bay that I can't reach?  That is, those areas on either side that are
up above the top of the engine bay?  I think I'll try a mirror to see up
there but when I reach my hand up there I can feel a roughness that feels
like surface rust.

TIA
