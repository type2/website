Now here comes the time to get this starter going and got a problem. Bearing

on my starter is beat-up. Is there a replacement bearing available for a 6V

starter? There might not be too much of a difference between 6 and 12V but

that's what I have. I think it's called throw-out bearing if I'm not

mistaken.

yes there is.  actually you need to bring the old one to the store with you 
when you get it, as the inner diameter depends on the size (V) of the 
starter, and the outer diameter depends on the trans, whethr it was 
originally 6V or 12V.   so easiest to bring the old one in, as there are 4 
sizes.  The bushings are pretty cheap though.    You are talking about the 
bushing where the nose of the starter goes to the trans?   
the throw out bearing is between the tranns and the clutch.
