Wow! Let's get out of the sun and grab a cold one!
Just a little play on words &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;pasture&quot;, get
it? I have read similar good natured ribbings on the
list before and was trying one out for myself.
Apparently, I have no sense of humor or at least a bad
sense of timing; both of which are grounds for a 
deserved immediate verbal spanking. Thank you. :)

&gt; Sean I don't know you and apparently you don't know 
&gt; Britt!  So 
&gt; before you start passing judgment find out what and
&gt; who you 
&gt; are talking about!
&gt; Britt has broken down WHILE towing another bus for a
&gt; fellow 
&gt; VBer.  Britt has traveled across the US in the
&gt; Roadcow and
&gt; the trip before this one he towed Bryant Brecht(sp)
&gt; half way to 
&gt; a show/campout in the so.east and then all the way
&gt; back to Kansas
&gt; out of the kindness of his heart!  He has given up
&gt; his leisure time
&gt; at campouts to help others pull their engine/tranny
&gt; for repairs 
&gt; without ever asking so much as a thank you.
&gt;  Sean, you say you don't want to start a 'flame
&gt; war'- TOO LATE!
