&gt; Seems to me a 110v bathroom heater with an extension cord could warm up the interior of a bus and defrost the windshield while you're caffeinating in the morning. Get fancier with a timer of correct amperage. I suspect electrical costs are cheaper than the gas the engine would burn to heat the interior. Don't neglect to warm up the engine.

I use the bottom off of a &quot;popcorn Pumper&quot; hot-air popcorn maker.  It has
a heating element and a fan, which circulates the air nicely.  Cost was $5
at the local goodwill.  It defrosts the windows in about 15 minutes of
running, using about 4 cents of electricity to do so.
