Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Grounding Tail Light Bucket - Not Metal?

Matt asked:  Why??? from my post of: &gt;I would hesitate to run a wire all the
way back to the negative post of
&gt;the battery.



My argument is that when ever I have dug into any vehicle that some PO has
attempted to modify the wiring, it is almost always a bad hack job... I
guess if you make sure you run a brown wire from the lights back to the neg
post I'd say that is better than some other misc colored wire.  Just think a
week/month/year into the future and your trying to figure some other wiring
problem out and you see this strange wire.  Keep it simple I guess or at
least make it match the wiring diagram for your year vehicle as close as
possible.

... currently fretting wire loom sheathing issues with a *new* repro wire
harness that is not close enough to my og wire harness nor like Rich Barkers
old wire harness which he graciously sent up to me for reference and to
scavenge bits and pieces from)... If You have an old wire harness taking up
space in your garage, send it on over to me!
