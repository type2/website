&lt;&lt;  I got a new oil pump to see if that would help my lack of oil pressure.

  a tighter fit I thought. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chet,
Remove the oil pump cover and put a straight edge across the pump and then 
measure with a feeler gauge to see if there is at least .004 clearance.  If 
not you need to take a piece of glass for a flat surface and sandpaper to 
remove enough of the rear faces of the gears to provide the proper 
clearances.   Then fix your starter problem!   Eric&amp;Barb
