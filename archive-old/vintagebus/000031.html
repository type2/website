I had one of those in one of my busses once.....
I removed EVERY last piece of bakalite.....and handed a metal frame to teresa 
koch asking her to restore it.
She took one look at my straight face and busted up laughing. =)

&lt;&lt;i've got a steering wheel that's missing about 95% of the bakelite
material. Seriously, it's basically just the metal frame!

Seems like one of those times to try something custom. Any suggestions?
Anybody done anything wierd with an old steering wheel?
