Thanks to all for the support, but like I say the key is knowing what your
getting, price isn't always the best deal, I could sell Brazilian doors
seals,engine seals, glass seals etc,
. but they don't last or have the right profiles.

everything that I sell for the pre 67 transporter has been used by myself
and others around me, and we have seen how different products last and hold
up. as I have said I have used each and every product I sell, you don't have
to buy from me, but just make sure you know what your getting. I will tell
you.

&lt;&lt;&gt;Greetings and Felicitations, all ye Transported Ones,

Felicitations?  I used to watch that...a WB show, right?  ;)

&gt;Some time ago, during a busy/hectic period, I saw, but lost the message
from
&gt;a rubber/seal supplier who is on the list.

I went thru Ronnie (and was patient enough to try and reach me at work ;)
for all my door/hatch seals and most of my driver/pass. door seals for way
better than places like RMMW could dare to offer.  :)
