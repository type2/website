Subject: more tripping, buses going S on I-5 to where????////t

drove up to Seattle this afternoon in the 61, and  was almost at Tacoma when 
a car carrier type truck headed south with three (3) splitties on it!  nothing 
else, just  a green/white, a red/white, and a blue/white, there was 2 21 
windows and one standard.  neat.   whose exporting buses from WA to the south?  
looked somewhat taken apart, maybe going to a body/paint shop?

unfortunately, the heat does not quite turn all the way off in the bus, and 
with the improved heat tubing connections, and it being about 80F out, it was 
toasty even with the safari open.   

next I'll have to take my air vent apart and seal the sides.   The air blows 
through from above the windsheild , I can stick my hand in where the headliner 
is ripped and feel a good breeze there.  and If I turn the air vent off, it 
makes a annoying flapping noise.    I guess I could just duct tape the inlet 
vent again through.
