heck, just deposit the check and see if it clears, if it clears send him
the VW if not turn it over to the local authorites as &quot;Check fraud&quot; in one
case you sell your VW, in the other you are out nothing and he is on
record

personally I would use the check to open an account, when the check clears
withdraw the money and redeposit in your real checking account

&gt; I'm selling a bug on TheSamba and the guy sends me the
&gt; typical email: I live in France, a guy in the states
&gt; owes me money and he will pick up the car, I want to
&gt; send you a cashiers check for more than the amount and
&gt; have you send me the rest...
