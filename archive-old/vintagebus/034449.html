Supposedly my van has a beetle engine in it, according to the little rich
boys who sold it to me. Engine number is
211 101 102
which i found on the right side bottom of the crankcase after I took the
heads off. Now call me crazy but a bus is a type 2, hence the 211?
Is it possible to determine year of vehicle an engine came in with this
info? Thanks for any help.

that is a part number you found.  The engine serial number is just under the 
generator stand,  (but not on type 3s).  Then look in the back of your Muir 
Idiot book where there is  a list of engine numbers and what VWs they came 
in.      

what does the number tell you?   what sort of motor it is.   The cases that 
start with A or B have larger oil passages.   As yours has a 211 part number 
it likely was originally out of a 68-71 bus, with the mounting bits for the 
rear hanger.   (?)   The cases starting with A ( or AE, AK etc) have a better 
alloy and are less likely to warp or crack.   The  H and HO cases were 1500s, 
used in bus through 67 and bug through 69.   F case was originally 1300 bug.  
 etc etc.  It is nice to have thin studs and factory case savers.

oh, and even if yours was originally a bay window bus motor, it is still 
entirely possible it was in a bug immediately before being put in your bus.
