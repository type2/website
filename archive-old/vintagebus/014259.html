&gt;I just want to get a new M/C since rebuild kits for the '67 don't seem
&gt;to be available -- and for that reason, I want to convert it to a later
&gt;m/c rather than use one of the rare and expensive '67 replacements.

I was feeling that way too when I pulled the pan to mess with the draglink
and saw the boot to the MC was just a bit wet.
*************************************
I was whining aboutthe '67 MC deal in the type2 chatroom the other night and
another listmember whose intials are Dave Easterwood said that ATE is now
manufacturing the correct 1967 one year only MC and it is going for
about$120 or so. I have not gotten serious about looking for it yet as other
issues or occupying my wallet and time.

Anyone out there bought one or know of a good source?
