For those that would like to know, Diana said she's is going to try and make
the Arvada, CO bugs on the green show.  You just might see her there.
Remember:  Whitish 1966 Westy with Tennesse plates.  I've heard so much
about Jason - the guy that gave her the bus - he must be one absolutely
awesome dude - truly a VW bus nut - cares more about someone getting a bus
rather than getting the money.
