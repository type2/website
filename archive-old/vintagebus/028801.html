Greg,

I've got a bay Riviera brochure on the Riviera pages at
&lt;http://wetwesties.tripod_dot_com&gt;  Just follow the Riviera link. It has a tent
pic on it.  You can also find Riviera (Actually White Stag) tent pics on Joe
Clark's tent pages.  &lt;http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/&gt;

&gt; OK in a late night whim this evening I decided to figure out how
&gt; to assemble my Riviera side tent/awning so I can use it on the
&gt; Panel next time out. At any rate I've had no luck. So can anyone
&gt; direct me to a picture of one assembled, or better yet somewhere
&gt; I could find instructions???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Greg
