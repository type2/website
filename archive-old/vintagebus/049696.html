&gt;It is possible to have your cylinders sleeved

&gt;a marine grade stainless steel sleeved cylinder will
&gt;last for many many years, irrespective of the amount
&gt;of use it gets.  At the same time you can set the cylinder
&gt;up to use more readily available rubber bits ...

I can vouch for this method. Even though it is expensive, it works. I
recently got tired of new seals leaking in pitted cylinders. Since nobody
in South Africa sells any new old bus parts, resleeving was my only option.

My POS beater panel's brakes are now really sharp (in absolute, not
comparative terms) and no more seeping brake fluid to contaminate my drums.
My 63 Dormobile is next up for this treatment.

I'm betting that stainless resleeved cylinders will outlast the rest of the
bus ...

Don't put up with bad brakes in your bus -- these beasts were designed to
stop adequately with a one-ton load -- a lightly loaded bus should pull
itself up quite smartly.
