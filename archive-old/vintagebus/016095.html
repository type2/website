&gt; a great conversation with him. He's not Satan, he
&gt; just got swamped.
 
Are you sure?  I would swear i saw horns and a
tail!....and swamped?  Crap! He should stop taking
folks cash and not sending them anything then!  

BTW he has $20 of mine I received nothing for.  So I
don't feel bad posting this as I know of his dealings
first hand.
