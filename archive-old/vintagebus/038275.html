Hi Volks,

normally this isn't my style but can't we do anything against this 
kind of people?  I'm a believer in live and let live, but looking at 
this pic I feel somewhat Paul McCartney-ish:  LIVE AND LET DIE.  
:-(((  You know, compared to this moron even those dreadful spammers 
look outright charismatic...

Thanks Everett for sharing, if only to keep my adrenaline level up.  
Sorry for the bandwidth, I just needed this.  And seriously - aren't 
buses too cheap?  Probably the only means against this kind of 
sacrilege would be to have buses be so expensive that even the worst 
morons feel the hurt.  :-|

&gt; I realized I already scanned a picture of the &quot;chop-top&quot; Barndoor Bus from
&gt; the SOTO meet, as mentioned yesterday.  It's in the temporary area of my
&gt; site:

Yours,
