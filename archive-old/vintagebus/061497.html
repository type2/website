If this is accurate then my '59 DC w/ vin# 514942 was actually the 57th bus of 
the '60 model year, probably completed on the first day of 1960 model year 
production!

'59 or '60 DC
'00 turbonium

[snip]

24 Sept 1959  511 907  
28 Sept 1959  514 149
30 Sept 1959  514 885  Begin 1960 model year

This is a little unusual; generally the model years started on 1
August.

This Bus would probably have orignally had the &quot;Bastard&quot; 40 HP engine
in it.  It falls in the right time frame, May 1959 to June 1960.  It's
pretty likely that this engine is no longer in it, as VW had a recall
campaign out on them.  If the engine number is between 3,400,000 and
3,580,000 then it's a Bastard.
