I wonder  how the headlights were working at all in the first place.  Did
it  have the short brown wire from the parking light bulb to the  headlamp
ground terminal?  That might explain it; on my '64 the  parking light
bulbs have that short brown wire, but the parking light  socket is also
designed to ground the bulb to the metal headlamp  shell.  That would
provide enough of a ground for the headlights to  work, at least until
you hit a real good bump or something.

&gt;One  neat thing I did find inside the headlite housing was somebody  had
&gt;wrote Blau with their fingers in the factory paint.

Maybe  they figured that some dealer mechanic would have to diagnose  the
headlights before delivery and would get to admire their  finger-paint
skillz.  :)

hello matt   I was told by Barnes that they all came from the  factory done 
like that and all the ground screwws were add over here at some  point.  The 
only way it could ground was thur the parking lite housing and  thur the screw 
to body. Pretty poor way to ground them I think. I just cut the  loop in teo 
and put terminals and a ground screw inside the housing and it fixed  the 
problem.  This truck is all OE so I am not too amazed that they were  still like the 
factory way.  later  mark  dearing
