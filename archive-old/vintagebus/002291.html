(Rhythmic, rolling acoustical guitar intro)

You can get anything you want
at Ellis's Restaurant (exceptin' Paula)

It was 3 Thanksgivings ago, 3 years ago on Thanksgiving that I first
stumbled across this list
And I realized right away that I had stumbled upon my kind of people.

Now, Ellis's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant,
It's the name of this song, which is why I still call this song Ellis's
Restaurant

So three years ago on Thanksgiving my friends and I decided
To go pay Ellis a visit at the restaurant

Now, Ellis didn't live in the restaurant
He lived on the Rusty Rancho nearby.
With his lovely wife Paula

and having all that acreage on the Rusty Rancho
where they used to keep all the VW busses
they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time

We got up there and saw all the garbage
We decided it would be a friendly gesture
For us to take the garbage down to the town dump

We took the half a ton of garbage and put it
into the back of a  silver and black VW Barnambulator (obvwc)
Took shovels a rakes and implements of destruction
And headed towards the town dump.

We got down to the dump, and there was a chain across the road
With a sign on it that said &quot;Dump Closed on Thanksgiving&quot;
Now we had never heard of a  dump closed on Thanksgiving before.

So with tears in our eyes, we drove off into the sunset
Looking for another place to put the garbage



(Anyone know the words, want to pick it up from here?)
