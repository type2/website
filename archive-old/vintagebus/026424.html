There doesn't seem to be a pattern really for engine compartment painting
when it comes to the Commercials.  It seems all passenger Buses were
painted.  Commercials Buses - trucks, panels, &amp; kombis - were fairly random.

What-ever...

Commercial vehicles are primer in the engine bay, I believe, up to a certain
year.  My ex-'63 SC was white, my ex-'60 SC was factory-looking primer.

Gas tanks are grey.  Barndoor tanks are black, mine has &gt;5 coats of paint on
it.  Gas likes to be cozy in a paint blanket. (Sounds like a Claraism)

gee thanks Everett I guess :).   ya bd gas tanks are black.  forgot about
that.  With AUF , ZU , and RES on them to indicate how to flip the reserve
lever for those functions.   but the 54 kombi had dove blue in the engine
area (much nicer than outside dove blue) and the 53 has the light beige that
was painted on the lower half when it was new. 56 deluxe had SWR EC. I have
seen a 67 with a bright metallic purple engine bay.  someones idea of kewl. 
had a 59 sc with the dove blue in theEC, my first splitty had the SWR in the
EC, but was aqua on the outside,  actually have never seen any thing that
didn't look like it came originally bottom half of bus colour when new.  But
what about those buses &quot;delivered in primer&quot; what did the OOs do with them?
