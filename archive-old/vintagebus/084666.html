Subject: Re: [VB] My Classic Weekend Report

&gt; Hi all, been a few years. To me it was Classic Weekend, not just OCTO
&gt; Weekend:

Great to hear from an old Classic Weekend volk!

I guess I stopped calling it the Classic Weekend when I started only making
the Classic itself about 1/2 the time, after getting fried w/ all the Bus
stuff beforehand that weekend. For that matter, same thing for Kelley Park.

Once you have seen a Barndoor Chicken coop, it is hard to appreciate that
Kubelwagen, 1948 og paint bug or twin vw powered lawnmower? grin
&gt; 
...............
&gt; 18) 5 AM up and over Hwy 60 to Dennys. This is the highlight of the weekend
&gt; for me. I GET CARDED WHEN I ORDER THE SENIOR BREAKFAST. Told waitress she gets
&gt; HUGE tip.

Now there's a waitress who knows how to work for tips!
