There is a product out there called Mold and Mildew Stain Remover made by
Iosso that is absolutely wonderful and killing and removing those black mold
spots.  I used it on a canopy that was covered with mold and it looked just
like new. It works almost instantly.

original message:
&gt; there are a couple of spots where there is black mold / mildew.
&gt; the material is fine, it just has these black blotches
&gt;
&gt; what can I spray on it to kill the mildew and not harm the fabric?

&gt; The ONLY thing I found that killed it and cleaned the spots a little was
&gt; Woolite mold and mildew killer in a spray can. I tried every product I
could
&gt; find on my sundial tent and this was the only thing that REALLY worked,
but
&gt; 8 cans later at 4 dollars plus a can and less then a 1/4 of the tent done
I
&gt; moved on to lesser products without the same results.
