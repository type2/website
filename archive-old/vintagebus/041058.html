Define Big $$$ and what type of hitch was it.  I don't know of any repro
ones.  I have a hommedade one that consists of a cross bar bolted to
a set of bumper brackets that you can *have* but I ain't shipping it.

does

&gt; one of them. Is there anyone out there that has a used one, or repo one
they
&gt; want to sell?
