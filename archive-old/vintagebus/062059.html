Subject: New BLANK GERMAN bay window rear drums! 

Hello everyone,
I got some very exciting news from Dave at CE!
&lt;http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com/cgi-bin/shop/web_store.cgi&gt; 
IF we can get some interest for German blank drums... Let me repeat that
GERMAN BLANK drums for 71-79 bays! He can get a batch of them. 
Please reply if you are interested.  Feel free to e-mail myself, or Dave at
CE indicating if there is a demand for them. 
I am pretty pumped because this makes Porsche (or any) wheels easily
adaptable to the bay (or early bay IRS split conversion) rear end... The
bays have been pretty weak in customization possibilities in this area for
too long.  Dave is going to make billet bay hubs to match the drums so no
worries there in compatibility issues.
Lets see what you think...
