  Sounds like you adjusted them 180 out, just a thought

Hi List,
I was adjusting my valves yesterday and this is what
happened: When I set at TDC #1, I adjusted intake and
exhaust for #1. I then rotated to TDC #4, I found I
couldn't adjust because even with the adjusters backed
all the way off, I still couldn't get the feeler gauge
in. Bottom line, I could adjust #3 and #1 but could
not get feeler in on #2 and #4. I bought some shims to
put behind the rocker assembly and adjusted all the
valves. When I started the motor it ran awful. It
sputtered and popped and backfired something awful.
What do you guys think happened?? 

Thanks,
3DPete
