&gt;This is a news alert warning for the Red Barn.
&gt;
&gt;It is on a very BUSY Hwy, where people think the faster you can go around a
&gt;blind corner the better.

Yes!!  Please Please, everyone be very wary of this situation!  The Red 
Barn is virtually on Hwy 101!  If you're heading north, there is a turn 
around in the middle of a grove of Eucalyptus trees, but you'll have to get 
into the left hand lane to do it.

The club will have signs to alert you...that you're getting close...about a 
1/2 mile before the Barn in each direction.

&gt;But as it says it is a RED BARN (huge) on the right side of the Hwy heading
&gt;north.

It really is hard to miss it.  Just go easy on the accelerator.  ;)

&gt;If things haven't changed, they lock the gate at dark, so those that arrive
&gt;after camped outside in an open field just north of the Red Barn, but if the
&gt;nice watchdog gentelman is there again this year he did open the gate and
&gt;let a bunch of buses in afterdark.

All I would personally ask of the people arriving early on Friday is to 
either park outside the gated area, or park on the left hand side (near the 
BBQ).  Otherwise, we'll have to roust you early and get you to move your 
bus in quick order as other buses come in.  And trust me, I'm a nice guy 
and all, but I really want things to run smoothly our first year out.  &lt;grins&gt;
