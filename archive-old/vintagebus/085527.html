Subject: Re: [VB] A new engine.

Thanks George,

Does seem that I will not need to cut the body, just the rear skirt. As for 
the belly pan, it does box in completely. The entire area under the flat 
cargo floor is covered up.

I already visited the Outback guys. They have the reversed intake figured 
out and will sell any of the parts needed. Mostly it just turns 180 and 
bolts back on and then the throttle does need some sort of a reverser. As 
long as they can make a few bucks, it looks like they will be happy to help 
out.

Here is another really good site. http://www.subaruvanagon_dot_com/ Tom has 
emailed a lot of good information to me as well as measuring a 2.2L engine 
as 28-17/32 wide. The opening in the engine compartment is 29-3/16. Looks 
like a fit.

I just need to figure out where to put the silly radiator. Best idea I have 
so far is to use 2 of them plumbed in series. One each mounted on either 
side of the engine compartment covering the battery area on one side. Now 
where to place the battery? If I decide to go forward, it will be an 
interesting project. Just want to retain backwards compatability just in 
case it don't work out.

If you have any more thoughts on the radiator...

Cruise control would be a nice option for a 42 year old vehicle.
