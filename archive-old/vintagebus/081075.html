Subject: '61 Double Cab engine

Yesterday I was able to borrow a trailer after work to bring my truck 
home. I drove it onto and off of the trailer. When I was backing into 
the carport I saw tons of white smoke. Darn. Looks like it's the 
engine for sure.

Today after work I got after it and yanked the engine. I tore it down 
the the &quot;longblock&quot;. All the tin, exhaust, carb, intake, ect. is off. 
Got it down to the heads.

I'm going to wait 'til tomorrow to tear into it. I'm hoping it'll be 
a bad piston or something. This is a beater motor. Actually was 
picked up off the ground in a field. They slapped a rebuilt carb and 
a muffler on it and fired it up. Darn thing ran smooth. Has pretty 
much continued to run smooth since I've owned the truck. And I drive 
it to work most every day.

So we'll see tomorrow. I'm resisiting a complete teardown, but keep 
hearing E &amp; B wispering their advice in my ear. So maybe I'll yank it 
all apart and at the least clean things up, and make sure nothing is 
too bad in there. I could always slap in some new bearings ect. 
Really need the truck running and don't want to mess with it for 
quite a few more years. Just keep it a running &quot;beater&quot;.

We'll see what I find this weekend.
