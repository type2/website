Are you talking about the ones on ebay?  From the pix, they look
like they're either BusBoys or Wolfgang Safaris - I've not heard
of them making their *own* safaris.    It looks to me like they're
making themselves into a clearing house for various repro bits;
the deluxe trim they're selling looks like the stuff from CE, etc.

As to the quality of the windows, I feel you're better served to
spend a little more and buy Izzy's or CE.  

Besides - why buy retail items on ebay, unless you know for *certain*
that you're gonna pay less than retail?  I keep seeing over-the-counter
items going for more than retail because people just don't get this
simple fact thru their heads.
