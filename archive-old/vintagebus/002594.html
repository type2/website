I've fretted on removing my brake lever for several months now... tried
heat, oil, heat, oil, etc. etc.  There is just no easy way to get at it.
It's the *only* thing that I have not been able to remove from underneath my
59 double cab project.... ugh.

Right now, I'm either going to cut the pin and make another one or mask
carefully and paint the thing in place.
