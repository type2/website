&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   It's been so long since I've driven a VW with a stock speedo
that I forgot which light is which on it. Now before you say the red light is
this and the green light is this, my speedo is so old that the lights are
faded and I don't know which one is which. I went out
driving today and the light on the left came on, but I don't know which one is
which :-)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


Nope - don't trust that the lightbulbs are on the right side either.  One
reliable in-cab way to tell which bulb is which is to test this when the
vehicle is in good repair.  Get the bus going down the street - say, in 2nd or
3rd gear and normal engine revs.  Turn the key off, but keep it in gear.  The
light that shines as the bus is coasting to a stop is the generator light. 
Now, when the bus has come to a rest, turn the key back on.  Do both lights
shine now? Which one is the one that remained off before?  That one (the other
one) is the oil light.

Otherwise, since you are having problems with your bus, just take the oil
sending unit wire off of the sending unit and ground it to the case and check
which light (key on, please) is on.  (Oil light)

Many other ways to check this stuff.  This should get you started!
