Subject: Turn Signal aftermarket replacements?
Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2001 09:47:41 -0400

I was wondering if there is an alternative turn signal switch/assembly
available for our busses?

I thought I fixed mine my resoldering the contacts, but that fix was short
lived and the left turn signal never worked anyway.  Astrogeek reports the
same problem, that these old units are just too old and fragile to hang on
anymore.

There used to be repo ones for a million dollars, but that price is a little
prohibitive for me :)  They were about $225 if I remember right, and now no
longer available...  I guess no one else thought it was a deal either!

Anyway I was wondering what lovely part NAPA (insert your favorite parts
store here) may have to replace this unit?  I think it would be an easy fit
for an aftermarket universal switch and all the wires probably hook up
easy...  Except the brake light switch that runs through there, I have no
idea if that poses an issue?

This may be a job for our resident expert of electricals... Matt Roberds!

Thanks!
