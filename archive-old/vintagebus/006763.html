 all replacement German and Mexican gland nuts do have replaceable needle
bearings, as do the 1500 ones that came off 2 virgin 1966 bus engines that I
rebuilt, as for 40 hp or 1300 I do not know. In the clutch packs that I sell
Sachs, they come with German T/O bearing (new style), and Brazilian
diaphragm P/P and spring disc., also included in the kit is a clutch
alignment tool, T/O bearing clips and a new PILOT bearing for the gland nut!
But I always replace the gland nut as they are inexpensive.

&gt; Is the gland nut needle bearing supposed to come out (if necessary) and is
&gt; it possible if I don't have the special VW tool # xxx?

No, the needle bearing doesn't come out. You just replace the gland nut with
a new one. Put a tiny dab of grease in it. Tiny I said, you aren't packing a
CV joint! Check endplay before and after. If it needs reshimming, get the
shims while you're getting the gland nut.
