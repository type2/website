What I did was to get the cheaper bench mount VW
engine stand, and then went to the discount store and
got the cheap engine stand for &quot;regular&quot; engines, and
bolted the VW stand to a chunk of 6x6 wood which I
then bolted to the &quot;regular&quot; floor stand.  It worked
well when I had the 79  2L engine out of my 75 bus,
held the weight fine, and worked great with the 1600 I
worked on to put tin the 65 double cab.  Total cost
was $80 or so I think, and I have a stand that I can
use for AC VWs or for the engine from my old Ford 9N
tractor if necessary.
