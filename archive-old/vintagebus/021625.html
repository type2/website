&lt;&lt; I start it up, backfires a little
 bit, sometimes more, than it revs REALLY high once it starts and won't slow
 down. WHAT IS WRONG?!  &gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
Is your accelerator linkage not going back to the idle postion quickly?  If
so it might need to be greased, or we have found it works better with both
the early on throttle cable return spring and the late engine return spring
on the carburator at the same time.  Otherwise there was not enough return
pressure.  Have you been good and applied a drop or two of oil under the
distributor rotor every time you tune you VW up?  Could be that your
centrifical wieghts in the distributor are sticking due to lack of
lubrication.   Eric&amp;Barb

re throttle cable/linkage

ya- so you don't need to lift the accelerator pedal up with your toe.  (if
that is stuck)    Also check the carb spring that pulls the accelerator  arm
and thus pedal back--- is it there, is it working?   If you have the 70s
style barefoot on your gas pedal it is neccessary t have an extra spring- on
my 65 (w/foot) I have the spring between the top and bttom of carb also the
one that pushes the arm back from the fan housing.   To compensate for the
extra weight on the pedal.    I haven't fund it neccessary to do that w/o the
foorweight, but am sure it makes it move quicker.     If you just have the
one spring between top &amp; bottom of carb make sure it is not worn out ( w/o
acce cable attached it snaps back quick.)    I also found that using the
stock accelerator cable bowden tube (available off a bug in your local
junkyard) that runs from body to engine over the trans also helps with the
accelerator movement.    And as Veewee111 said, dont forget to lubricate
things on your old bus.  Grease is your friend.
