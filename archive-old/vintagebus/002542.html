Subject: Undercoating Removal Nightmare
Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 20:03:43 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;



I seem to have a method for the removal of the undercoating on my bus - this
stuff is very thick and very tough.
First I go over a small area with a paint scrapper or chisel  I get any of
the loose stuff off first.  Then I use a propane torch to heat the
undercoating that didn't come off with the straight scrapping, which usually
means all of it, and I scrap off the bulk in the small area. I have a couple
of heat guns and they are just too slow.  Next I spray the small area with a
solvent - lacquer thinner or paint thinner in a spray bottle.  Then I rub
the area with steel wool.  Then I spray the area with simple green and hose
it off with water.  I try and do a small area at a time because the solvents
are flammable and I really don't want to do a Richard Pryor and run down the
road in flames.  My gas tank is OUT of my bus, as are my motor and
transaxle.  And I have a fire extinguser close at hand.  This undercoating
has been very protective of my bus for the last 40 years but where it has
given way and allowed moisture through the rust is serious.  I find it
usefull to scrap first without heat because if I don't the undercoating gets
soft and sticks - this defeats my purpose.

I just finished another wheel well and most of the area around the
underneath of my engine bay.  It really looks amazing - there is virtually
no sign of undercoating left.   I still can't really believe that I am doing
such a thorough job - knock on wood.  I por-15'd a wheel well already that I
didn't use a solvent on and there was a thin film of the melted undercoating
left on it.  By a thin coat I mean thinner than a coat of paint - I'll keep
an eye on this and maybe I'll have to do it again.  Since I'm doing this in
my backyard there is a lot of water being used - I'm really cautious with
these solvents that I'm using.

I have this big mother of a syringe it must hold a cup and I'm planning on
squirting por-15 into those impossible to get at places - I'm not sure that
this is such a great idea as por-15 is supposed to be applyed in thin coats
but how else can I get rust protection in those hard to reach places?

I'm wondering about Undercoating - should I undercoat after por-15'ing.
When a rock hits undercoating I would expect that there is a bit of give
that would make chipping less likely to occur than when a rock hits por-15
alone.

All thoughts and  comments welcome.
