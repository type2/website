Subject: Re: [VB] Pitting and Darlington

I  have no idea about the powdercoating part. On most things we can take it
to bare metal spary por-15 on it then tie coat primer. If the pits are not
super deep that normally does the trick. Metal to Metal is the filler ya'll
are talking about and is made by evercoat, i get it at a local flaps called
carquest. If i intended on trying to fill it i'd use the metal to metal, not
bodo or fiberglass. As for welding or leading,  your talking alot of time in
that process  wether it be bumpers or safari's or what ever.. Your call.
Showed the Binz at Darlington SC sunday, got a plaque in the unfinished
class, Gene Hickman took one in the pre 67 class as well. We had a blast,
met more folks than i can rember, and was dog tired, but grinin ,,later,
