&gt;A bus (Loaf or split) would leave an east coast city and head West 
&gt;on a specified route.  At the same time a Split or loaf would leave a 
&gt;west cost city and head east.  They would carry a VW Emblem as 
&gt;a baton to be passed off to other list members at rendevous points 
&gt;across the country.

Maybe part of the purpose would be to cover the MOST miles and utilize the
MOST listees to carry the baton.  Zig Zag that sucker all over the place!
Encourage use of back roads and scenic routes - that's what buses are best
for anyway (no back-tracking or 'circling' allowed).  It would also enable
more people to be involved, not just the ones on the 'shortest' route from
coast to coast.  Maybe even award bonus points if there are 2 or more buses
traveling together for portions of the rally.

Anyone know how much those instant polaroid cameras cost?  Maybe we could
all chip in and buy two of them to be passed from bus to bus (heck, use the
cameras as the baton).  That way, 1 or 2 pictures could be taken of the
participant and their bus for each leg of the rally and passed along.  Maybe
a diary book too.  Then at the end we could have the pics scanned in and
posted to a web site along with the diary entries from each participant.

I think it'd be fun - count me in and let me know what I can do to help get
it going!
