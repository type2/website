There are 3 common styles:

* Over the emblem - allows for safari windows and protects the emblem
from beastie boy rapper trophy hunters

* passenger side nose - this is the most common I've seen; the advantage
is easy accessibilty from the inside (ie easier installation) but unless
you put 2 90 degree bends in the antenna, it will interefer with safari
windows

* up the windshield pillar - I think this is the slickest setup, but
it requires an antenna with an extra support post for the roof.

I've also seen a factory lit piece of a bus with the antenna mounted by the 
left  rear taillight.

&gt; So what's your stock-looking antenna setup? What sort of mounting?  Where
&gt; is it mounted, if not right front?
