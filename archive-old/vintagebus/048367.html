Hi all,



I've been wondering: out of those split busses ever produced, what would be

the ratio between RHD &amp; LHD ?



Anybody can help?



MaMaT

I haev seen lists of expors to different countries by year (don't ask me wher
ethe lists are).

Figure out which countries are RHD and which LHD, and which switched and when,
then add up the numbers.   

That's all I can think of
