Subject: Re: [VB] Bulb Type for Speedo &amp; Clock

&gt;Anyone know what the bulb type/incandesent number (or any other
&gt;identifying numbers) are for the bulbs in the speedo and clock of
&gt;a 1966 Microbus?

Eric and Barb already posted the &quot;N&quot; number.  I don't think there is
an ANSI standard type number for these bulbs or if there is one I've
never seen a reference to it.  I have a '97 Wagner bulb catalog that
lists a bulb that appears to have the same base as the VW speedometer
bulbs as a &quot;11009&quot;, but I think this is a Wagner propietary numbering
scheme for European specification bulbs.  That 11009 is listed as
14.4 V, 1.73 W, 1 cp, and has a base type of &quot;BA75mm(12V 1.5W)&quot;.
They also list a 17061, 24.0 V, 3.12 W, 0.60 cp bulb with a &quot;BA7s&quot;
base and the same reference picture as the 11009.  They don't have
any listings that I can find for 6 volt bulbs.

In my experience, you have to go to a VW dealer or FLVWPS to get these
bulbs.  They are not like tail-light bulbs where you can buy a 1154 (6v)
or 1157 (12v) at any FLAPS in the world and have it fit and work.  I
know VW dealers usually have the 12 V ones in stock - don't know about
the 6v ones.  Most of the VW mail-order places have whatever bulbs you
might need.

I hope this helps!
