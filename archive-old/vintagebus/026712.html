&gt; For the last year and a bit I have read the about all the meets that you
&gt; lucky
&gt; Americans are able to attend. We don't get that many down here(like one a
&gt; decade!) so I've always read them and gone greenybrown with envy. Well now
&gt; it's my turn. This Sunday there is the innaugaral meeting of the
&gt; Johannesburg Vintage VW club.

&gt; 

I think we 'Mericans should all get together and pitch in ten bucks a
piece and have a raffle, winner gets a plane ticket to SA to see the
event. Send the checks to me and I will draw the winner, and make sure
to send you all lots of pics when I ...I mean, the winner gets back...

Anyone check Travelocity to see what a ticket would cost?
