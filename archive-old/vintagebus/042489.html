I agree,

I only use gasoline for cleaning in VERY specific cases (cleaning brake
pads is the only one i can think of.)

Gasoline is way too flamable and bad for you if you ge it on your skin to
use it regularly.  Use kerosene, if you need more oomh use paint thinner
(its cheap and cuts a bit more than kerosene i think..)

When i used to paint for a living, my boss freaked me out once by throwing
a lit cigarette into a bucket of paint thinner, i jumped, but it just went
out.  Paint thinner is not very flammable as a liquid. (dont try this at
home kids, even though it didnt burn, this is a bad idea...)

take care,

Steve
