I've blown up a few engines myself. After I got over the stress of the
last one blown, I decided to build my own, the way I wanted it. I had a
spare engine to run in the meantime, so I could take my time and do it
right. I learned a lot from the experience, and built an engine I am
happy with... 

Borrow an engine, or buy a beater cheap while you rebuild yours, or if
you have another car you can use in the meantime, that's cool, too... By
all means look at it as an opportunity!
