I pulled the fuel tank out of the Westy a few weeks ago.  When I pulled the 
bolt out of the hose, some of the vilest goo I've ever seen came out.  But 
only a little.  It was enough to make me flee the garage in terror due to 
the smell though.  Gasoline that sits for twenty years isn't too great.

It was clogged up pretty badly.  The filter screen, which promptly
disintegrated upon removal, was a fetid brown mass...a new one is on the way.
I pressure washed the tank inside and out, and now the funk -- that is, the 
fuel flows freely.  There's some minor rust inside the tank though.  The
outside is fine, it was preserved by a thick layer of dust.

I'm considering sealing the tank.  Considering because the FLAPS people looked
at me like I was crazy when I started talking about fuel tanks and making broad
sloshing gestures with my arms.  If I would have found something, I would have
hauled off and just done it...but it looks like I have to mail order whatever
I use, if I decide to do it.  I'm looking for some input, like what I might use
to seal the tank, or maybe if I should even bother with it at all.

BTW -- the reverse light lense thing, I think the lenses for the bus reverse/T3
lights are the same size, but they may be different in design.  I may have
two of these available to me courtesy of Dave Easterwood, and if they're the
same size I'll probably just swap out both lenses.  Also Matt Roberds had a 
novel idea for the reverse light disconnects that I plan to explore tommorrow
:-)  Thanks for all the help from the list here!
