ever pull the tar boards out of a vw bug or porsche 356?
90% of the time RUST
have seen way to many 356 porsche and vw's beetles that
don't look rusty, taken the pans to be blasted (sand or walnut, for the
porsche's)
didn't pull out the tar board, had these beautiful bare metal parts, went to
prep
for paint and low and behold checked the tar boards and rust under them,
(what a pain in the a##)
had to brake out the little blaster and clean these areas, BUT the storey
did't end there
when painfully removing the heavy tar undercoating from the 356 porsche
(don't see to many beetles with this) there was 0 rust. if you want to see
how the factory did this find a copy of BUILT BY HAND
the making of the 356 porsche, at the factory it showed 2 guys brushing on a
seam sealer type substance where all panels met with a brush then spraying
the rest of the chassis with an undercoating gun, like you would use with 3
M body schutz or wurth undercoating (oem supplier to vw and porsche)
of sealing products just another thought on how to seal up your bus
ps,  i still see some of the porsches that i restored over 10 years ago and
there still as clean? underneath as the day i did them (old porsches don't
seem to change hands as often as old buses do)
just my other 5 pennys worth, the other was bed liner (do it yourself) with
rust inhibiter in it)
