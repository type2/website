Subject: Gas geyser

Since it's on my bus, I figure it's bus-related...

I've got this seriously mishandled Sondermodel. I've been nursing it back to
health for the past four years as economics permit and it's doing pretty
fine, thank you, except for one thing.

When it's hot, gas cascades with a captial &quot;C&quot; out the fuel tank neck, past
the gas cap and all over the side of the bus and the left rear tire.

I hesitated to post this because I'm sure it's something obvious, but I
can't see it. A hole was drilled in the gas cap to ventilate the pressure,
and the gas cap fits niceley (I assume it's for the bus).

But all that's nothing. Here's the rub: it doesn't do it consistently. On a
given blistering day I can come out to my bus, named &quot;Grief&quot; only because it
is anthing but menacing, and the side of my bus is as dry as the drought in
Nevada, gas &quot;waterfall&quot; wise, and other days, parked in the same place, at
the same angle, and with a similar amount of gas in the gas tank (I've
experimented on different days to see if it was fuel level, but even then,
so?), it's shooting out past the gas gap.

(And I remember what gas used to smell like... what'd they put in this stuff
anyways... this stuff now'days is really raspy... oops, 'nother subject).

Anyways, the gas has, of course, completey ruined the one-of-a-kind paint
that's on the vehicle with that &quot;I don't care about this vehicle&quot; usually
seen on those bombers from the 80's.

Hardly the case. I'm just wondering how to fix the deal because when I get
it painted, I don't want to do it over.

Insight?

Thanks Greatly.
