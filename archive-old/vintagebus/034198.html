I am in need of someone in the Dallas area to go and look at a 41 Ford truck
for me.
It is in the 972 telephone prefix area if that helps.  And if you could take
some digital pics and send them to me...even better!
If anyone in the Dallas area can take the time to do this....let me know
please.   Thanks in advance.
later
