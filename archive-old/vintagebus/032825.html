Hi,
Well we went through our VW bus sales literature.  Found three with the same
factory drawing of the Bastard 40 HP engine with non-36 HP air cleaner that
is in that recent VW Bus book.  VW literature #s 151 519 23,  151 559 23,
and 151 550 23.  Plus in a Westie sales literature &quot;The VW Camper with
Westfalia Delux Equipment&quot;  VW literature # 152 562 21 has a side cut away
drawing of the entire bus and Bastard 40 HP engine with this same air
cleaner.  So this means we have found four images with both identifyable
Bastard 40 HP engine and it's non-36HP air cleaner.  Plus two photos in the
1959 VW bus shop manual that do not show enough of the engine to figure if it
is a Bastard 40 HP or very early 40 HP, but the opposite side of this page
has photos of the Bastard 40.  We really apprieciate all of the help folks
have given us on this question.  We have a 1960 panel made 10 DEC 59 and have
found an engine to restore and show with, but probably not installed in our
bus.  Have found one of these Bastard 40 HP air cleaners and we helped Bill
D. of Wolfsburg Warehouse sell about 5 or 6 of these air cleaners so they are
not a prototype.

  Hey Todd S. would you mind suppling the month, year, and is there a VW
literature # of your 1960 owners manual?
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
PS someone last week asked that was not this engine actually a 36 HP and they
were right.  The reason it is called a Bastard 40 HP is the case, heads, head
tin, pistons and cylinders, muffler, and crank is very close to a 40 HP.  The
cam, tappets, and much of the rest of the engine are or can be used on a 40
HP.  While the carb is 36 HP and the intake manifold is either 36 HP or
Bastard 40 HP only part.  It is interesting to see that even though the 36,
Bastard 40, and 40 HP, engines have the same cylinder size (77mm) the same
throw to the cranks (64mm) that it is due to the differant carb, intake
manifold, and differant sized valves that make the HP differance.  EEE&amp;B
