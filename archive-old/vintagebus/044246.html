&gt;  Hi Real Bus People    Hey, What I want to know is when
&gt;  do we all get invited to Hawaii?....There is a Listee
&gt;  over there and I got a feeling it's time for a beach
&gt;  party.....&quot;Splitties in Hawaii&quot;...Speaking of
&gt;  &quot;Splitty&quot; is there a listee on here from SLO town with

ya, from the west coast time zone it is three hours earlier the next day or 
something.  I talked to my Mom in New Zealand last week and it was 4 or 5 
hours earlier the next day.  real confusing.  I think a day last 47 hours or 
something if you keep going around the world.

bus content:   You CAN actually loosen old door bolts.  I got the last three 
bolt screws holding the rear cargo door on my 61 loose.  Using implements of 
destruction, I mean coercion, I mean persuasion, they finally decided to 
agree with me that change was okay.  So I adjusted the way the door hung, and 
no longer any annoying squeek SQUEEK squeek rattle when I drive.  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Would have swapped the door for the nice replacement door, but the 
replacement door has no glass in it, and I have no new seals for solid glass 
handy.
