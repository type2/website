Subject: Rocker problems on rebuild

Clueless Joe here, making headway on his inaugural engine rebuild 
but running headlong into another snag.

Reassembling the rocker shafts to the head, using new adjuster 
screws since the old ones were a bit uneven, but I find that #1 
Exhaust rocker -- even with the screw back all the way out -- never 
comes completely off the valve stem.  Zero lash.

I suspect this to be a potential Bad Thing.

Why is this happening?  The pushrods seem to be of equal length.  
Every other valve has lash (though the rocker arms come within 
2mm of the valve stems on most).  Tried swapping the rocker 
assemblies but no change.  Is the valve stem too long?!?  

Can I shim up the rocker assemblies (I've seen the shims at the 
FLAPS, &amp; read something about them somewhere) without 
causing other wierdness?  

Any ideas/suggestions appreciated.  If I can get past this 
headache, I MIGHT get to hear this thing run in March.
