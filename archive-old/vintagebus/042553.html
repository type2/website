hi all,

Since my bus doesnt have a radio, this morning i was so overcome by the
beautiful weather and Fahrvergnugen that i spontaneously broke into a
vocal rendering of the 5th dimesnions cheery Age of Aquarius song as i was
rolling down the highway... vent wings and side windows fully open. a nice
temperate breeze flowing across my face.  Ahhh.  and only 2 or 3 people
cut me off, and i only honked at one of them ;)  It didnt even cross my
mind to stay mad for more than a few seconds.

Its good to be a bus pilot some days... 

take care,

Steve
