Subject: RE: [VB] UHaul Horror Story?

UHaul has THE worst tracking system on the planet.I could probably implement a better system on an old Tandy 100 and smoke signals.

I  reserved an AT and it was not there when promised.Talked to the agent and he told me they don't really have a tracking system that accomadates a true reservation as the equipment may or may not be there when promised,NO SHIT.

So I blazed through all the rental shops in the phone book and found a sweet deal at a trailer builder.Super cheap rate on a top notch unit even had real electric brakes to mate with the controller in my truck and not those sketchy surge units.

Subject: [VB] UHaul Horror Story?


Hi All-

I am planning on picking up a trailer/truck from Uhaul over the weekend to tow a bus I have recently purchased(obligatory bus content). The &quot;reservation&quot;  letter I have before me from UHAUL seems to be not be as much of a reservation as it may first appear.

Call me Chicken Little but I made a few follow up calls to make sure all was in order with the Uhaul agent that I am dealing with to actually pick up the equipment and they tell me that they cannot guarantee that they will have a vehicle/trailer available to me that  I reserved. They tell me that I might need to go to another dealer to get the equipment within a 50 mile radius!  In spekaing with the &quot;customer serviced: 1-800 number if you scratch the caling tones they give you regarding the specifics of your resevervation they will give you the same answer. Hardly a reservation if you ask me- to me reservation and &quot;cannot guarantee and might&quot; should not go in the same sentence.

Right now this is all conjecture as the day of reckoning has yet to arrive (Sunday) however based on this I am not getting that great a feeling about this.

Has anyone else had dealings with UHaul concerning this and how were they (hopefully) resolved?

I want to sort this nonsense out before I get to the UHaul store to find out that they may not have what I reserved.


Thanks

michael
