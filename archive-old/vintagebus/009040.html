Subject: My Visit with Michael Steinke of Bulli Kartei (long)

I had to go to Frankfurt two weeks ago for a quick business meeting. As
schedules go it was pretty hectic, I arrived in Frankfurt on Sunday morning
at 8:00 am. Had Sunday free (although it was late Saturday night/early
Sunday morning for me. Had a long meeting on Monday, then dinner with a
colleague and Tuesday morning I was back on a plane for Chicago.

While in Frankfurt at the suggestion of Uncle Jerry Jess, I had the
opportunity to visit for a couple of hours on Sunday afternoon with Michael
Steinke. Some of you may know about Michael and his enthusiasm for buses. He
is a knowledgable and generous individual.
He owns at least 5, including a 1955 School Bus that he acquired from
directly from Volkswagen.
Michael is very interesting and his home office is filled with VW
memorabilia and collectables.
I was fortunate enough to visit Michael on the day before he and his club
&quot;Bulli Kartei&quot; embarked on their 15th annual humanitarian relief action
&quot;Bullis Bringen Freude&quot; which translates to &quot;Bullis Bringing Joy&quot;. On the
day after our visit Michael and seven other bus pilots were leaving to take
over four tons of donated medicine, clothing, blankets and other relief
supplies to Sarajevo. I believe Michael said that there were four splits and
two Type III vanagons in the convoy.
This is an annual five day trip, two days driving in, a day in Sarajevo and
two days to get home.
Michael told me during our visit that he and his club love driving their
buses, but got tired of going to another campground, or another show and
wanted to find a way to help relieve the suffering of others while enjoying
their buses at the same time.
To me, a native midwesterner, the thought of being able to get into your
split and driving into a war-torn desperate area in the same amount of time
it would take me to get from my house to Omaha or Cleveland is truly
amazing.
I don't speak Deutsche, but there are some interesting web pages devoted to
Bulli Kartei and their humanitarian endeavors. I encourage everyone to look
them up at www.b-b-f_dot_de.
Another cool thing that Michael does is to have a collectible Brekina
miniature made of one of the splits that goes on the trip each year, he then
sells them to raise money for future relief convoys.
I was truly impressed with my new friend and the work he and his club are
doing.
