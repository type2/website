&gt;When I bought it my 63 Dormobile (based on Kombi) had a confirmed 69 000
&gt;miles &gt;on the odo. It is still painted in grey primer underneath, with
&gt;signs of &gt;turquoise overspray in the wheel wells (bus is blue-white over
&gt;turquoise).
&gt;

I checked the underside again this wekend and I see it is fully painted in
the wheel wells, with the rest of the undercarriage in grey primer, with
turquise overspray round the sills.

And I also noticed in Laurence Meredith's &quot;Original VW Bus&quot;:
M031 - Unpainted undercarriage

Could this have been a lower-cost option for drier climates?
