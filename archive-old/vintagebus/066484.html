Subject: re:minnowfish

sounds too good to be true...which usually means it is. has anyone ever
tried this? if one of the vendors on the list could somehow convince him to
give them a test model-then report back. I would try asking, but i don't
know enough about carbs to be able to properly test the thing out.

one other thing that caught my eye...they claim 100 hours of work into each
carb, yet they sell them for 200 english pounds. that comes out to 2 pounds
per hour, less than $5/hour. sounds pretty cheap.
