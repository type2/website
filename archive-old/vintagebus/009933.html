I beg to differ. We bus people would have been far more likely to notice
Kristen in her travels, and therefore to be able to provide clues that might
help the investigators. Sometimes tiny clues can help track down the
perpetrator, and with a case like this, every little bit helps. A Toyota
driver would not have paid attention to a VW; one of us would. Surely we can
spare a little list space in the cause of finding the bastard. It's
unlikely, but it's worth the chance.
