I've stayed out of this 'never ending thread' for one reason and one
reason alone.  I've never ordered from Bus Depot.  However, I do have
a comment to make regarding shipping.  

My wife, Lisa, does a LOT of ebay business.  She's a
seamstress/costume designer.  We purchase many materials mail order
and we ship everything.  Depending upon the delivery schedules we use
USPS or FedEx for out-going product.  Our suppliers tend to use either
UPS or FedEx Ground.  We have experienced the following...

Two shipments outbound.  Shipped the same time.  One to Texas, one to
Eureka, CA.  The Texas shipment took three days.  The Eureka shipment
took ten.  Texas, 2000 miles. Eureka, 380 miles.  You just never can tell...

Shipment inbound.  From Pendleton.  50 miles.  Two day service. 
Shipped on Monday.  Arrived the following Monday.  FedEx Ground could
not tell us where it was.  After holding their feet to the fire for a
week following delivery, we found that the package had sat in the
truck until Friday when it was MAILED USPS overnight. &quot;We use USPS
when we have an overflow...&quot;

Mail order businesses seem to have little control over shippers. 
Unless they do hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly business. 
(But then the statistics get you...)

When Bus Depot achieves the volume of JC Whipme, they'll probably have
fewer delivery problems per capita. Until then, one should just factor
in the unexpected delays.  They're just gonna happen.
