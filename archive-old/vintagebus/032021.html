Subject: Grease du jour:shift rod-'65
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I pulled the shift rod out of my 65 (the tranny is out).  The rear shift
bushing can only be replaced by pulling the rod back- meaning trans must be
out to change it out.  I had previously replaced the front 2 shift bushings on
it, but the back one was inaccessable at that time, so here's my opportunity.
I undid the wires and undid the little square head screw holding the rear
shift rod to the front shift rod.  I am very careful about that as the collar
seems fragile to me, like the threads want to strip and mangle.  Then moved
the collar forward and wiggled the two rods away from each other and pushed
the rear back.   This was easy, as I had taken it apart before and carefully
greased it up.  The collar and two pieces of rod all like to stick together.
Then round to back, lifted the shift coupler up and ove rthe tube there, and
slid the whole rear shift rod out.   

I wiped it down, and pulled off the rear bushing, and replaced it with the new
(NOS) one.  I looked at the middle one, and noticed some wear, and that dirt
and grit had gotten in the tube the rod goes through, not surprising as the
front rubber seal has cracked and broken, odd that it was still there at all.
I should have used a broom stick with rag to clean out the tube, but I didn't.
I merely greased the rod, especially around the bushings, and reinserted it,
and hooked up the linkage in front again, with a tad more grease, using my
stylee square 8mm socket on that screw, and passing the wire through the hole
in the head and around the linkage and twisting the ends together.   

I guess I should find that front dirt seal to keep crud out of the tube, think
maybe I'll undo it, do thebroomstick thing, and duct tape the old one
together.  Nah, I should just Do It Right (book by Arnott et al) and get the
durn seal.   I don't like taking those apart a lot.   I wonder about a source
for new collars. (part # 211 711 169A)   My parts list does not show the front
dust cover, maybe is the same as the rear? (211 711 167A).  interesting, this
parts list has hand written in ( and I know one person on this list knows
whose writing was in the one this was copied from, the original still being in
use at a dealership) to use the rubber boot for the gear shift in the cab (211
711 115) for the dust cover over the hockey stick coming out of the tranny
(211 311 289A)   I have some extra  211 311 289As and some boots, so maybe I
can use one to fit up front, as I think the front of the tube should be
covered (it just ain't decent)  SO why isn't that seal shown in the parts
lists?  Ah, I thought they were infallable.   Where did the thrashed one on my
65 come from, and does it have a VW part number?

these questions may be further explored.
