Well, here in formerly sunny California, I'm learning that the original 
design of the rain gutters on a Bus is awful!  It makes sure the rain water 
falls right onto the corners of each window.  We've all dealt with rust in 
these areas, but has anyone done anything to try and direct the water away 
from there?  I wanna hear some ideas, but I've considered hacking off the 
tops of, like, 1 liter soda bottles and duct taping them to the corners of 
my rain gutters to help shoot the water out past the body.  Probably a bad 
design...looks atrocious and will probly come off on the freeway, but I'd 
be curious to see what other people have thought of in this department.

**Don't forget Bring Your Own Bus 2001, April 21st, at the Red Barn 40mi 
south of San Jose...the day before the oft-discussed Kelley Park event!**
