Since it's Friday, I'll go ahead and step up to say:

&quot;I drive mine too!&quot; everyday that it allows me to...which is just about all the time these days, but there have been those occassions when OT (other transportation) was wise.

There are a bunch of us in Memphis who drive our buses everyday. It never occurred to me that people who could wouldn't.

Living vicariously through myself...

Joe

PS Looking for cheap skylight glass if anyone out there has it.
