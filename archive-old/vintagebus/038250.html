Subject: 58 SC FS in San Diego
Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 17:01:45 -0700

I need money so...I'm selling my 58 SC project.  It has the original
bumpers and 15&quot; rims.  It is a complete bus less the taillights and
headlights.  It doesn't run but I have the un-original not-running 40
horse engine it came with.  The engine has a spun rod bearing and is a
complete engine...in pieces.  The tranny and the brakes have been redone
but not by me so their condition is unknown.  If anyone is interested
and wants to make me an offer over $1700, please email me directly.
