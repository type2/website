I agree.  The Tinkertoy never ran without and so I gloried in very low
temps.  Eric&amp;Barb posted something a while back that made sense.  The
different materials in the engine have different coefficients of
expansion and so the engine needs to run at or close to optimal
temperature. Otherwise the wear patterns in the cylinders will be
abnormal, resulting in premature need of a rebuild.

No she does not have a thermostat. Been looking for all the goodies to
install one but boneyards are scarce around here and new $tuff is
$pendy.  Yeah, what's the true cost of a premature rebuild....
