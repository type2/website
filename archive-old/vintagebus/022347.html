&gt;'m headed out to K-Mart to buy some dutchboy
&gt;rattle can primer.  They've got it on sale for 75 cents a can.  

Make sure it's actually primer. Some of the cheaper brands (like wal-marts
.98 cents one) are actually just paint that is dull grey. I don't know
about dutchboy. I know the Krylon stuff is actually primer. I don't think
it'll matter for dusting the POR-15. But if you use it for more, might want
to check.
