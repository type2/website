My main man, John Kyte said:
I keep thinking I have the highly desirable benchseat/cab divider.
I tell myself it helps keep the drafts out some, but some door seals would
help alot more.  As a matter of fact in the days I had a 67 crawl-over I
made my own cab divider out of plywood they were so desirable.  You also
don't have to look at all the junk floating around in the back with the
highly sought after cab divider.

&gt;&gt;Ellis surmises that you could have the cab divider in the walk-through
(obligatory hyphen) with the dog door option in the bottom. Put Ol' Shep in
the back and let him/her come and go as desired. This would add new meaning
to FLAPS with the &quot;flap-flap&quot; sound of the dog door. The only down-side to
this would make it harder for Bill Bowman to get back and forth between the
crew station and the galley.

John the K continued:
 Of course the RFH doesn't have drafts I'm sure unless you open the safaris!
Handy in Phx. in the summer or is it more like a convection oven that way?
Depending on where you live I suppose some M-Codes  are better than others.

&gt;&gt;Overly opinionated Ellis corrects Kyte by secretly admitting that the RFH
does indeed have a draft via the whistling wing vent seals. &lt; Mcode option
MX-260Ar &gt; We don't need that Deer whistle thing. The wildlife hears us
coming for miles. No reason to have the Baygen wind-up with the light
because we can't hear ourselves think over the whistle or the wind noise
caused by cracking the vent in an attempt to avoid it. Passengers in other
vehicles think that Paula and I are fighting due to the screaming at each
other when, in fact, we are only trying to talk over the wind and engine
noises. I've tried endlessly to correct the whistle leak without success
until someone suggested that I &quot;stuff a sock in it&quot;. I just assumed that
they were afflicted by the wingvent thing too and made the connection all by
my-self. I think it is another conspiracy that Art Bell needs to hear about...
