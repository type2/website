&gt;... Another tried and failed aftermarket part.

&gt;Well after running a mild CB Performance grind camshaft... I am going
back
&gt;to stock!  For my needs I think the stock cam will be perfect for
better low
&gt;end torque (I never see past 4000 RPM anyway and the CB cam lives above
3500
&gt;RPM which gives me little use).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the lift and duration of this cam.  &quot;Mild performance grind&quot;
doesn't mean a whole lot to
me.  I'd like to know because I just installed one in my new motor.



&gt;Also what is the best timing offset?  They seem to come in +2, +1, 0,
-1,
&gt;and -2 formats.  I am thinking that 0 is the best choice  or would
something
&gt;more aggressive be better like +2?

Timing offset? Huh???  More aggressive??  The gear lash that you are
referring to has nothing to
do with being more aggressive.  Its either right or wrong.

You, the engine builder, need to measure the &quot;lash&quot; between the cam gear
and the drive gear on the
crank.  This should be ideally measured with a dial indicator (see the
Bob Hoover articles in VW Trends a few months back on cam dial in) and
properly modified cam followers (lifters).  You can also just lock the
crank and try to rock the cam gear with your hand.  There should be VERY
slight movement (I forget the actual spec).  In addition, you need to
roll the crank and cam backwards (counter clockwise) to see if
the lash is too tight.  If it is too tight, the cam and gear will want
to walk out of the saddles.  When doing this put slight pressure with a
finger on the thrust bearing journal.  BTW a thrust hub (cut down
flywheel) should be used to insure the crank is kept in place.  Read the
Hoover articles...they are pretty complete, but assume you've got a
large amount of machinist tools and equipment.

Originally, there were to be gears available from +5 to -5 (some say +7
to -7),  I found it very
difficult if not impossible to find anything more than +/- 2.  I got it
as close as I could with a
-2 from GB.  The 0 supplied from CB (they BTW didn't even know what I
was talking about and said that they only had one size...huh??) was too
tight and the cam walked out badly.  In the Hoover articles he finds
junk cams and takes the gears off and modifies them for adjustable
operation.
