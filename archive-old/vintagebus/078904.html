Subject: Need help in Kansas????  (JC)

I received a call this morning from a gentelen asking for help.
Rick Peeler I believe is his name, answering machine picked up
lots of background noise.

Anyway, does anyoen know if he still needs help?  I went down to
Wal Mart looking for him, but he wasnt' there.

Please have him call me again at home.  785-223-0262 or
785-226-3674 Cell.

Thanks, hope I can help.
