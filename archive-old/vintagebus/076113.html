Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 7-23-03

Been busy with work lately, but finally had some time to work on the 
'61 Rat Rod Double Cab.

I sucked it up and decided to try and chase away my turn signal 
gremlins today. When I had last pulled the speedometer to clean it up 
and change out the bulbs, i ended up with turn signals not working 
after re-installing it. I went to the autoparts store and grabbed 
another generic flasher. When I installed it, it would work 
sometimes, and sometimes not. I also noticed my horn wasn't working. 
I looked at the fuse box. I gotta admit, this fancy 1961 fuse box 
with push on connectors just isn't my cup of tea. I tend to like the 
screw type connecters on my older fuse boxes. And my &quot;rig&quot; job on 
this particular one didn't quite cut the mustard.

You see, the fuse box was missing a hunk of plastic and I didn't have 
a spare handy at the time I was working on it. So I basically made do 
with it and taped it into place when I was done. I did this BEFORE I 
brought my parts stash into town.

Now I've got a good spare. So the time came to yank the fuse box and 
replace it with a better one. In the process I went ahead and 
soldered the tab connectors together like was suggested to me on this 
list. I put new fuses in the thing and hooked all the wires back up. 
Now it seems my turn signals are working OK. I didn't have time to 
really test them a bunch, but they worked every time I tested them so 
far.

My horn still isn't working, but that could be a problem under the 
bus as I had yanked the wires off it for another un-needed project. 
Those always seem to be what get me into trouble! I've got another 
horn here I'll use to test with as well.

So tommarrow I'm gonna get the fuse box mounted back up. How exactly 
DOES the fuse box mount up? Does it just pop in or is there supposed 
to be some kind of holder to keep it in place?

Also, I'm using a generic 2 prong flasher right now. I don't have my 
speedo turn light hooked up. What flasher do I need to hook that up 
properly? Can I rig a standard 3 prong flasher to work with it? Or 
will one of those work off the shelf? This is an early 1961 model 
truck.

When I get that fuse box mounted up and have everything working right 
again, I'm going to get the title, get some insurance, register the 
bus, and get it inspected before something stops working on it again! 
That way I can at least drive it some while I finish it up.

I gotta stay focused and on track with this thing. It's supposed to 
be a low budget quick &quot;rat bus&quot; project. No messin' around with body 
work and all that mess. Just get the thing functional, give it a flat 
black paintjob, polish the chrome, and drive the beast. So far I've 
done good other than spending a little more time than I'd like to. 
But it's gotta be street legal and safe enough to drive around town. 
So far I think I'm there.
