Hi Steve.  Sounds like a grounding problem.  My 66 behaved the same way
until I ran a separate line to ground the housing.  I am not familiar with
6V 59 panel but double -check all grounds, especially the housings.  Good
luck.

&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I have a bit of a problem with my 59 panel. When I put my foot on the brake pedal the brake lights come on but one is very dim (bad earth I thought). When the park lights are on the one that goes dim goes compleatly out when the brake pedal is depressed. I'm running 6v and have cleaned all of the conections. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
