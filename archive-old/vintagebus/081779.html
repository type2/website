  it go?

&gt;&gt;  I was speaking of the plastic 3 inch tube that comes on a new accelerator

is not the plastic tube I was asking about.  &lt;&lt;
Hi Joe,
Otay!  The OG cables never had that short sheath of  plastic.  Noticed that 
the ones we have gotten have had the part number on  it and mayhaps that is the 
only reason it is there.  We just leave it  up front where it seems to do 
nothing.
