&lt;&lt;  What is the weight limit on the roofrack ladders?&gt;&gt;

Hi Brian,
Probably about 500 Lbs.

&lt;&lt;Second.  What are the sidesteps going for these days? &gt;&gt;

Which type?  Assuming you mean the cargo and not the front door ones.  It 
could be a pop-out one for a bus with or without belly pans or a tilt out one 
or one of those that are installed into the jack points which could be made 
out of extruded aluminum or diamond plate steel.    Eric&amp;Barb
