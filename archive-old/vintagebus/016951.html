Well, your '67 should have a switch on the trans, at least if your bus
has the reverse lights in the body.

This gizmo I just installed goes between the speedo and the cable, so
when you start going backwards, it closes the switch, which lights
up the light.  When you move forward again, it opens the switch and
turns off the light.  I ran a hot from the fuse box, to the switch, then
back to the light, which I mounted on the bumper.  I mounted the one light on
the driver's side, just left of the overrider.  I plan to install
a second one on the other side.

&gt; Okay, how's this work?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sick of people telling me that my (non-existent) reversing light doesn't
&gt; work. I was also thinking of fitting one to save me from crazy near-blind
&gt; old dears in the supermarket car-park.
