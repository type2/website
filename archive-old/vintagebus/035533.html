well the lack of power was becaus ethe aircorrection jet was not tight enough,
and backed out.  Tightened that up, and suddenly the bus goes up hills.


the lack of oil pressure is beacause the cooler I put on there was cruddy.   I
had slooshed solvent around in it, and blew it out with compressed air, but a
chunk somewhere came loose while driving, and clogged the cooler.    I had it
out and to a shop today to check it, it clogged, then hey a chunk blew out-
then it was free!!! and held pressure fine.  Driving it had cleaned it out
somewhat actually, but that's not the best way to do it.  next time I will
make sure it is thoroughly clean first!!!!!  soak/solvent tank time

at least- I believe that was the cause, the engine is not back in yet, to do
the final confirming that it is back to usual pressure.
