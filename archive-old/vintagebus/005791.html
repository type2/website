hey john,
i currently have about 5 grand in my 58 dd
i had to sand blast the roof the front nose and alot of the rain lip
the quarter panels on it were recycled from a later model bus
unfortunately they have the lips on them the only true down fall to my
restoration
but it was alot easier to use a real correct  skin to cover were the wheel
flares where
it was a perfect fit and the sheet metal was rust free and $free$
I had to track down a set of ribbed bumpers that was a ongoing search
but it was rewarding as the old guy who owns the junkyard just said &quot;them
are old&quot;
gave me the bumpers and a cab divider for 65 bucks  score!!
I got a rebuilt motor and all the trimmings new carb 009 etc.
it took a while to strip the shell down and smooth it out but the looks that
i get driving around are worth the hard work . later  john

&gt;Hey John,
&gt;I would say go with what you have in it.  Can you document your expenses?
&gt;I'd think in the 8k range, but am looking at internet pictures and they
&gt;are usually much more forgiving than the human eye.:)  It may be worth
&gt;more than that.  It seems the values just keep going up.  It sure looks
&gt;good. I've got a 58 that looks alot better than what you brought home, but
&gt;doesn't come near what you've got now. Mine was dove blue, but has 3 coats
&gt;since, currently tan with red stripe.  Sure looks like a nice job and much
&gt;effort.  How much $ did you put in just of curiosity? I doubt I'll put
&gt;that into mine but I think, I need all new rubber, there are a couple
&gt;small rust patches, if I put rubber in, do I strip it and paint? HA!  It
&gt;goes on and on doesn't it?:)
