&gt; Someone once told me they hauled 5000 lbs. of sand in their '56 Single Cab.
&gt; They then dropped the taillgate and repeatedly punched the gas to spread the
&gt; sand over their property.

I once hauled 4500 lbs of glass marbles in my '57.  Took all my weight on
the break to stop.  Starting was so slow that the light changed 3/4 of the
way across the intersection.  Everything seem OK after.  BTW, the marbles
were melted down for glass blowing.
