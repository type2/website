Subject: 63 engine hatch latch ???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I have just replaced the engine hatch on the 63 singlecab and there are a
couple of questions that I have.
The 63 uses a church-key to open it, the hatch I was given had a handle, it
looks as if there was a key in the middle sometime.
I removed the handle by taking off the 10 mm bolt, and lo &amp; behold it was just
like it used a church key.

When did they start putting handles on the engine compartment, and can I just
take it off and use my church-key and it still is original
