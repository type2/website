&gt; How does everybody clear out a blocked heat riser?  The one on my bus
&gt; managed to get clogged at some point over the summer, and now when it gets

&gt; to work on it, but I can't think of a way to clear out the blockage.  Any
&gt; ideas, people?  Thanks.

keep in mind that when I did this the manifold was off the engine. I
took a piece of old clutch cable and put it on the end of a power
drill. then fed it through the riser while running it. I kept spraying
carb cleaner in there as well, and w/out much work got it cleaned out
pretty decent. HTH
