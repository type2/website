Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator Q

If you use the PROPER parts and connectors and common sense ther is no
reason for it to look like  a train wreck.If done correctly most people will
not know it is not stock.

Do not take this as a slam against you.It is an issue that has to do with
the pride and understanding of the job to be done.Do a little research to
understand the task at hand,get the parts from the scrap yard for a few
dollars and you will not need to buy a new alternator.

I suggest you pull as much of the rear wiring harness as you can get.This
will leave you with a length of wire which will allow you many mounting
possibilities when locating the regulator in the engine bay.

 True, but I don't want it to look like a train wreck
in there either!
