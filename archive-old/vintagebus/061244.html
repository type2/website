John,

Carbs generally dont just stop working...The jets wear out, the throttle
shaft bores wear out (to bad solex didnt bush'm when they
built'm!)...floats go bad, idle cutoff solenoids die...chokes stop
opening...but none of that requires replacement of the carb. (well, it's
debatable with regards to bushing the throttle shaft bores..)

I suspect your bus is randomly stalling out at idle?  Sometimes it'll
idle, sometimes it wont?  (you only mention having checked the timing..)
Have to looked at the cutoff solenoid?  Often this little guy will work
his way loose from the body of the carb...and cause this /exact/ problem.
Just tighten it back up and you've saved yourself $200 or so dollars.

If it wont idle at all, i'd check to be sure that the solenoid is
working...(assuming it's tight!)  With the engine not running, turn the
key on and pull the little wire off of the solenoid.  Spark warnings apply
here so be careful.  Now, tap the wire back to the contact...you should be
able to hear the solenoid &quot;click.&quot;  Pull the wire off and tap it back on a
few times just to be sure.  Clicking?  Keep looking. Not clicking?  Lets
be sure we still have voltage to the wire.  This wire should be attached
to the key-switched side of the coil and should get +12v when the key is
turned on.

If none of that helps...run through for us the problem, and what you've
done toward solving it, in detail.  I'm sure we can prevent you from
replacing a perfectly good carb. :)
