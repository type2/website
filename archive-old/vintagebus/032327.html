 A friend of mine needs a rebuilt steering box for his '64 single cab.
 What's the best source of a rebuilt one, and where do they fall,
 price-wise.  Any feedback on the quality of the rebuild would be
 appreciated as well.
 
 In addition, is it possible to get a locking column box rebuilt thru one of
 these vendors?
  &gt;

you cab get a rebuidt box from Wolfgang in Redding.  I had one done and they 
require a locking core to get you a locking box- ...

except I have some NOS collars for the steering lock column, so it could be 
installed when apart, have it lock and be better than used in that they tend 
to get the edges of the collar somewhat mushy from trying to turn the wheel 
when locked over decades.
