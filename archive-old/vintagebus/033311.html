&lt;&lt; I'd prefer water run out on the floor rather than sit in the dash tray. &gt;&gt;

Thom, I'd rather have water (or in my case, mud) in my dash tray than on the 
floor.  Dash trays screw in, and I have a bunch of them.  Floors require 
welding to replace the rusted holes!

PS  Here in the Southwest my safaris only leak badly when I'm going down the 
road.  Lots of fun pulling out maps, registration, etc., while driving at 
highway speeds trying to stay up w/ the caravan...
