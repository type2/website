Just stay away from Quality German AutoParts in LA.  They sold a new engine
to me with a cracked head, and refused to ship a replacement since I did not
pay for the warranty ($200).

Subject: [VB] where to buy parts


&gt;   I have a ton of parts I need for me '67 Deluxe restoration.  I'm in
&gt; northern calif, and the only parts I have purchased so far have been body
&gt; parts and safaris (from Alan Schofield &amp; CE).   Being in the West I have
&gt; considered purchasing from Bus Boys, Wolfgang Intl, Wolfsbufg West, and
West
&gt; Coast Metrics.  In general can anyone recommend (or recommend against) any
&gt; of these businesses as far as quality and customer service is concerned?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; HK
