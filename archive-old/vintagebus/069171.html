Subject: Re: [VB] safari windows

I have the CD safaris, and like them.  They look more correct and seemed
to 'go' better than domestic brands.  Particularly, the edges look more correct,
and the latches aren't just hacked-up cheapie repro vent wing latches which
don't last more than 5 open/close iterations.
