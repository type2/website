While researching where to get spare parts for my 67 Westy I contacted
numerous sources in Germany (I happen to know a lot of the dealers
personnally).
Besides finding out that I can get any front spindle/kingpin part, I
also was offered the Westfalia rear floor covering.
This stuff seems to be quite rare in the US and I have seem numerous
Westies without it.
It is not quite clear if it is the type for the split or the stuff from
the early bay window. They are very similar, but I will find out.
I want to order one of these floors for my Westy, but the shipping will
definitely be expensive, while shipping more than one will be almost the
same. I wonder if anyone else is interested in one?
By the time the part is at your door in the US it will cost approx.
$210. Of course it might get cheaper if more people order.
Please p-mail me if interested in any way. I will then update you on the
details of the procurement progress.
