&gt;I was surprised to not see much on the use of the Kymco Torquemeister on 
&gt;removing big tranny nuts in the archive.  Has no one done this?

I haven't done it either with the Torquemeister or the conventional way,
but I will have to someday ('64, big nut).  Here's the equivalent 
procedure done the conventional way:

1.  Buy a 46 mm socket  (Snap-On IMM460, $43)
2.  Buy a breaker bar   (Snap-On GSN18A, $52, 18&quot; industrial finish)
3.  Buy a suitable piece of galvanized or black gas pipe  ($10-$20)
4.  Put socket on breaker bar
5.  Put socket on nut
6.  Put pipe on breaker bar
7.  Away you go...

Total cost $105-$115 depending on pipe.  If you already have a
suitable breaker bar, $53-$63.  If you weigh over 143 pounds you
probably don't even need the pipe, but it makes it easier.  No
cutting or welding.  Also, when you're done working on the rear
axle, you have a nice breaker bar that you can use with all your
other 1/2&quot; sockets.  You can use it with your 3/8&quot; sockets too
with a $10 adapter.

Prices are from Snap-On's online catalog, an excellent place to
visit in case you got a wad of money for the holidays.  :)  No
affiliation, etc.  http://www.snap-on_dot_com/
