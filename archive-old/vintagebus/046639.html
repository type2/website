 &lt;&lt; So what exactly should I be buying?&gt;&gt;
 Hi Rex,
 There are many brands out there, we buy in the five gallon can &quot;Henry 
Asphalt Roof Coating and Cement.  Non-fibered, Brush Grade, Solvent based.
  
 &lt;&gt;
 Our Home Base, Home Depot, and Eagle hardware stores have this so hopefully 
yours will too.
  
 &lt;&lt;What else do I need to purchase to apply it?&gt;&gt;
 A condiment squeeze bottle with the removable tip cover.  Not the screw 
open/closed kind!
  
 &lt;&lt;What procedure do you use for application?&gt;&gt;
 For fixed windows we paint a thin layer on the body and squeeze tar in the 
channel in the rubber where the glass is inserted to prevent that nasty white 
haze at the bottom of the glass from water attacking the laminate.
  
 &lt;&lt;Do you put it on all rubber? Like frame to glass/frame to body, body on the
  pop-outs?&gt;&gt;
 For pop open windows we are considering applying it thinly in the channels 
that hold the base of the rubber on the frame and paint the body opening 
where the outer seal goes on the bottom and lower sides.  Above that just 
glue these seals in place.
  
 &lt;&lt;What about cargo doors, rear hatch, front doors, engine compartment, 
ect.?&gt;&gt;
 Again the main nasty rusty areas seem to occur on the lower sides and 
bottoms of these seals.  So we have been thinking about treating only these 
lower areas to prevent problems.
  
 &lt;&lt;I've got fresh paint, is it gonna mess it up?  How do I clean up any that 
get's where it's not supposed to be?&gt;&gt;
 Depends on how fresh and how long and how warm the drying room if there was 
one used was.  Without a drying room it is best to let paint dry for at least 
a week if not three.  Otherwise as long as the paint is dry and you clean the 
excess off with kerosene it should do just fine.
  
 &lt;&lt;Will it leak or drip out in extremely hot weather?&gt;&gt;
 We only have had one drip in four buses done this way so far.
  
 &lt;&lt;What if I need to remove the rubber/glass in the future?&gt;&gt;
 No problem we just did thois a year ago when one of our windshields was hit 
by a big rock.  Removed the seal and glass by foot power.  Carefully cleaned 
out all the glass shards ut of the seal and reapplied tar to the body and 
seal and reinstalled the seal with new glass.
  
  &lt;&lt;Any other tips?&gt;&gt;
 Yes, use automotive wiring to tie and pull the seal and glass in place.
 Also if you throughly rinse out the dog legs and rockers and clean the 
drains then let them dry during the hot weather for a couple of weeks you can 
flood them with roofing tar thinned by 1/3 or 1/2 with clean new motor oil or 
kerosene to stop/prevent rusting out.        Hope this all helps, Eric&amp;Barb  
&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; What kind of glue do you reccommend? &gt;&gt;
3M seal glue works very well. Just make sure it is the black color of thier 
glue and not the goldish yellow color.  If any of the glue ends up showing it 
does not look good in the goldish yellow.  Use the glue sparingly and 
especially in the upper corners of body side popout and door seals.
