Hi Steve,
From early 1964 model year chassi # 11454227 on through 1970ish all the buses 
used a 5 JK x 14 rim.

funny I had heard as well that the bay 14&quot; rims are 1/2&quot; wider than the 
splitt ones, but the other day when I was looking for  a good spare I looked 
at the date codes and the size mark and the bay and split 14&quot; were the same 
size.  THink that the 15&quot; bus rims are slightly narrower at 4.5&quot;, and if you 
get a mid sixities porchse rims (which is the spare for my 61) it is exactly 
the same size and bolt pattern as the 15&quot; bus rims.
