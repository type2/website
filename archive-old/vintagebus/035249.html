If anyone wants to trade a 59- hitch for a hitch to fit my 56 or 57 I'm game.
I'll kick down cash or parts too.
Mines just like Steves.
Thanks-
Greg

I've since mounted that hitch to my DC and I'll try to send in some pictures
of it mounted.

It mounts in 4 places front to back:

*With U-bolts over the torsion tube on either side of the tranny.

*With 4 bolts to the underside of the tranny cradle (this model Westfalia
hitch  is only for post press bumper busses to '67 with the U shaped tranny
cradle.  I think there are a two earlier models and later ones too).

*With the outriggers to the rear most bumper bracket mounting bolt.

*And finally under the center of the bumper with two bolts.

Fitted up, it seems VERY secure.  Not sure what the load rating is though.
I've yet to pull anything with it.   The biggest drawback is that you must
completely remove it to get the motor out.  I had to make up u-bolts that
were long enough too.  The ball size is metric and they are a bitch to find
over here but other than that they are great ;-)

Basically a useless accessory....cool though.
