I have read in more than one location that armorall is bad for rubber...it has
silicone in it which makes the rubber look better and maybe feel better, but
it is only short term. Supposedly it pulls the moisture out of the rubber to
the surface, in the end drying it out more than when you started...glycerin is
very good.

check out carcareonline_dot_com. They seem to have decent advice on this stuff.
