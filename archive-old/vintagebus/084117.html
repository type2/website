Subject: Re: Gas Guage, Horn

Today I am attempting to tackle this gas gauge problem again. I've removed the sender, that was previously identified as bad, and removed the outer tube that covers the float. Once inside I observe what looks like to me to be an intact unit. A small float that has four small wipers (two ea. side) that run up and down on some VERY thin wires. There is a central rod that everthing rides on. At the top is a small copper coil of sorts that the wires attach to by solder. One wire is attached directly to the rivot that holds the terminal on the outside all looks good. Any trickery with the multimeter that might give me some more clues? Or is this sending unit a loss?

&gt;
&gt;So I took the sender out of the tank and hooked it up to the gauge with
&gt;new jumper wires, stuck a coat hanger in one of the holes in the bottom
&gt;and cycled the float with no action at the gauge. The gauge sat at 1/1
&gt;the entire time and I could hear and feel the float going up and down.
&gt;So it looks like a new sender eh.

Pretty likely. As long as you're sure your ground wire was touching
bare metal on the sender, then it sounds like your sender is bad.

Unless you bought it from someplace that lets you return electrical
stuff, you probably don't have anything to lose by trying to take the
sender apart. If it's welded it might be interesting but sometimes
things like this are riveted or held together with tabs. I'd guess
that the wire is broken off of the hot terminal, or the wiper that
goes between the coiled wire and ground isn't making good contact.
You might be able to bend the wiper or solder the wire and fix it.
