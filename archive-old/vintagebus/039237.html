I have received a few questions about these modules so I will go ahead and
post this to the list for the newer folks...  The list used to bring these
up quite frequently, but lately I have heard nothing of them.  Also Bob
Hoover used to be an avid proponent to these modules.  

The CDI module is similar in operation to the MSD 5A module.  You get a box
that is connected to the coil and dizzy and needs remote mounting.  The CDI
stands for Captive Discharge Ignition and eliminates the Hall effect on the
points system.  Without being in I.E. or something, it basically gives a
full charge at all RPM where the Hall effect only produces peek efficiency
in a given RPM range.  

With the CDI you will keep the stock points but never have to replace
them...  Unless your rubbing block wears down over a long period of time,
also this means keep it lubricated at tune-ups.  The plug gap can be widened
a certain amount to make use of the more powerful spark and is reported to
increase mileage and drivability.  The car is much easier to start with a
CDI from my experiences.

I just let my CDI box ride in the drivers side battery tray area and secure
it loosely with Velcro tape.  Velcro tape is awesome I encourage that
everyone carry some with them, I got super duty stuff at Home Depot.  Some
people screw them in somewhere in the back, but with the Velcro I can snatch
it out if necessary.

The greatest thing of use is also the ability to disable the unit on the
fly.  You just flip the connector around and you can use the stock points
system again!  So if the CDI poops out you can still travel down the road...
If the Pertronix poops out you are screwed.  As a note you must flip the CDI
to the points setting for doing timing.  You can run any kind of dizzy on
this setup as well.

As an observation I believe Porsche used a similar CDI setup in the
1974-1983 911s equipped with the CIS fuel injection system.  It makes the
same tell-tale clicking sound when the ignition is on. 

Also I cannot speak highly enough about the customer support from Universal
Corp that has serviced my CDI well after any warrantee period and free of
charge... And happy to do it!  No muss no fuss.

Here is their internet link:   http://www.wic_dot_net/~univcorp/   The website
is week, but effective.  Also there is a link in the Type2 Library under the
key word &quot;CDI&quot;.

Who caries that?  I've never heard of one.  Do you need a stand alone unit
along with the module?
