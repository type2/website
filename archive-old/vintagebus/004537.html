I've seen quite a few drag busses at a local Wall Mart. Plenty of sets with
bus/bug combo too. We talked about these on the list before. There should be
another drag bus coming to stores sometime in January. One thing that I miss
now is more of these big bus/bug on the trailer combos. These were neat.


Later,

Andre


&gt; Hi everyone, I was at the mall today and saw a 1/18th scale &quot;drag bus&quot;
from
&gt; (I think,) miesto or majesto or whatever.  I also got a little matchbox
&gt; (black) bus and a conv. concept beetle.  I didnt but the drag bus, I'll
save
&gt; my money for a stock one (it was a splitty, (both buses)).
