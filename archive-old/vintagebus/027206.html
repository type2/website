I would just like to say that I've done business with John Briney and he
knows how to treat the customer right. He answered all my emails
promptly, shipped promptly, and even threw some extras in the box. I
bought a set of the seat covers he and his wife make and I'm really
happy with them. They're well made and look good in my non-vintage
Deluxe.
