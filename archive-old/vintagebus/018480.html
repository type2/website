hey all,
i am installing a new generator and voltage regulator,
after i do this how do i go about &quot;polorizing&quot; them?
im kinda unclear on this. also i have a 64 kombi vin
number 1156209- i think i heard somwhere that the
earlier 64's still had the pull type handles-being
that the 64 was the first year for push button type.
is this the case with me?    tia
                                phil
64 kombi
72 super
ps-almost forgot last night while doing a tuneup on my
super i ran across a spark plug that does not want to
come out. i am aware of the dreaded stripping of the
plug so i did not try to turn it. is there somthing i
could do about this? heat up the head? let the engine
run for a long while? please help and again tia
