Subject: Everybus trip report (personal and long)

Hello Friends,

As there are other trip reports either posted or coming soon on this
past weekend's event, I'm just posting my personal stuff about the
trip...

My good friend Joy was planning to make the trip but because of the
weather, she had to make arrangements for her dog so she would be able
to go. She was unable find a sitter for her dog, and couldn't leave it
out in the rain, so she wasn't able to make it. Needless to say, she was
very disappointed...

Cindy and I carabussed together up to Greensboro, both buses ran fine.
The weather slacked up a little (today was nice!), I got to meet more
list folks that I've been talking to for awhile but had never met in
person, played some music, enjoyed good food and good brew, saw some
great buses (who owns the stars and stripes bus?), had a really great
time... I took my dog Dante with me (a very big but gentle Rottie), and
he was a perfect gentleman...

Cindy and I missed the caravan to the Farmington IVWA show, trying to
help a young couple get their domestic station wagon started (they left
the bus at home because it had a bad oil leak). Eventually we gave up on
the station wagon and headed for Farmington...

Got a couple of miles from the campsite, bus was running great as usual,
then suddenly the engine went dead. I first suspected the new electronic
ignition (installed yesterday morning), so that's where I went first.
After further inspection, I eliminated my ignition system as the
culprit... I pulled the left valve cover and turned the engine over by
hand and found that my rocker arms weren't moving. My diagnosis is that
my cam gear has come loose...

After several unsuccessful tries at contacting anyone local via cell
phone, Cindy and I headed to Farmington in her bus. Once there, we told
Dave R what happened, and he spread the word... Several people offered
to keep my bus for me till I could figure out how to get it home. Kelly
Brown (aka MetalWizard) seemed to be the best place for it, and he now
has it at his shop... What a relief. Breaking down is bad enough, but I
was really more worried about having to leave it on the side of the road
while figuring out how to get it home...

At any rate, I'll pull the engine from my bug, get it up to Greensboro
in the next couple of days, do a quick engine swap and drive my bus
home... It will be a good opportunity to see Kelly's shop and hang out
with him for an evening...

THEN, I'll have to pull the 1776 apart and see exactly what happened...
I never heard any nasty noises when it quit, so hopefully nothing major
got damaged. It will be a good time to put in new bearings, fix the
mysterious oil leak, paint the tin, etc...

All in all, a good weekend, and another bus adventure...

david
