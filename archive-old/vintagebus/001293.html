Hi all, renoir here.

Too many projects.

I have a 1970 van that is in remarkably good shape.
It does need a short block, there is a hole in the engine case ( i did not
put it there). There is no rust other than just a smidgen under the
winshield. It has an ice box, storage box, pop sunroof, and foldout rear bed
seat. Tires are good including spare front mounted one. Glass is good and
clear, original carpet good, upholstry very good. All engine tin, hose, etc.
is there. California registration good till end of April.
I have not listed this van anywhere else yet.

Pictures are available, just pmail me
