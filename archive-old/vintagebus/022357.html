Ummmmm, not to be a pr*ck or anything, but I think in this case, at least
some of the fault lies with the buyer for not researching *what* he was
buying, comparing title VIN and vehicle VIN before buying, etc, etc...

&gt;THIS is the guy that SCREWED me out of the title for my 1966 panel van that
&gt;he SWORE up and down it was a 62 or 63, yet had the LARGE back hatch......so
&gt;he AINT a VW person. I can send anyone the copies of all his replies to me
&gt;and then quit answering my emails when I started asking for his help to get
&gt;a correct title. He had a title, but NOT the correct one, so he was driving
&gt;the panel van illegaly. He SAID he didnt know where the VIN numbers were
&gt;located since it didnt have the plate.
