In a message dated 98-10-25 11:52:10 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; The wheel wells were cut out of my '59 Kombi by some DSPO. Rather than
 hacking up a donor, I'm gonna fabricate them myself. I've actually already
 done 75% of it. I had planned on taking the replacement panels somewhere
 locally &amp; having the 1/4 (or is it 1/2 inch?) inward lip pressed into
 place. But after looking at it in comparison to my '62, I've come to
 realize, if it (the inward lip) wasn't there you wouldn't notice it. Is
 there any reason for this lip to be there other than cosmetics? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
That 90 degree inward lip is to help the wheel well panel stay striaght.
Without it these panels will flex in or out and look sloppy.  If you want to
maybe only half of the lip would do the job as long as you take care not to
bang them around when mounting/dismounting wheels on the back axle.  In the
end you will not get much more room for your trouble.  The later wheel wells
are not only wider due to the bubble flange that does not take up space inside
the wheel wells, but also they are about 1 1/2&quot; higher than the pre-1963 rear
wheel wells as measured from the roof line down.  Eric &amp; Barb
