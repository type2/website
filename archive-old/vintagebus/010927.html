&lt;&lt; My distributor is an 009. I found it on the site but only listed after '72 
which then it gave some outrageous 10 degree ATDC setting which didn't seem 
possible since I've run it nearly 3000miles at 7.5BTDC. I will set it at 7.5 
static and then get the advance to 28-30 BTDC. I'm just a bit baffled by this 
timing gun it is not mine. Mine has no dial and plugs into the #1 spot on the 
distributor. This one has an induction sensor that just clips around the 
#1wire and some dial on the back that adjusts when the light fires. I can 
change the reading on the pulley by adjusting this dial. How do I use this 
thing? Any Ideas? You have been an enormous help as always. Thank you. 
 I owe you both and John Kyte a few cold cokes if we ever meet. Thanks.

Hi Scott,
What type of VW did they list for that distributor?  Was it exactly all the 
same distributor numbers?
To time any VW you have to first make sure where your timing marks on the 
lower pulley really are!  The mark/s could be up to 5-10 degrees BTDC or 
ATDC!  We use an aftermarket aluminum pulley as a tool to figure out this and 
carve needed marks on the stocker puller such as the 180 mark for more 
accurate valve adjustments on cylinders # 2 and 4.
As to your adjustable timing light it is fairly easily once you know where 
your mark/s are really are!  If you have a 0 degree mark on a stocker pulley 
and want to see if the full advance is around 28-30 BTDC you just set the 
dial on the timing light say at 28 degrees and rev up the engine.  If the 
timing ends up at 28 degrees the timing light will flash so as to illuminate 
the 0 degree mark.  If it is 30 degrees BTDC then the 0 degree mark will be 
off 2 degrees off to the left of the case seam.  This really helps since 
there is no 28-30 BTDC mark/s on the stocker pulley.  If the timing never 
reaches so high you just adjust the dial on the timing light till the timing 
mark on the pulley is centered up on the case seam.
  Now if you do not have a 0 degree mark but say a 7 BTDC mark on the pulley 
to set for 28 BTDC you set the timing light dial for 21 degrees.  This 
illuminates the 7 BTDC mark at the case seam!   Eric&amp;Barb
