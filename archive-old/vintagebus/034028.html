Hi Ronnie,
Probably he means the type most call the harp mirror arms.  Much like the 
stocker round headed arms, but has straight piece of steel welded across the 
arc creating a D or harp shape.  These type of mirror arm were used with a 
rounded corner rectangle mirror heads that screw clamped to the arms.
