Subject: [VB] Spalsh pan seals, aircleaner to carb seals, and DOS.

Hi Volks,
Did anyone figure out how or who would be importing the splash pan seals?  
Does anyone have or know where to get the circular seal that seals the air 
cleaner to the top of the carberator?  Lastly does anyone have a good grasp 
of DOS language?  We need to switch C&amp;D drives, and we can not figure out the 
proper command.
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
