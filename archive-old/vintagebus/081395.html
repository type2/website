Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

I tried some LED bulbs in my 64 bus and was sorley disappointed. They don't
make use of the reflector AT ALL, so a
regular incandesent bulb was a whole lot brighter than the LED.

I did one side with the LED, and had a friend hit the brakes. In the
daytime, I couldn't tell the brake light was working unless I squatted down
to the level of the bulb.

LED bulbs (at least the ones I tried) were utterly useless in my opinion
(mostly due to the fact that they don't use the reflector at all!). If you
want to make a big difference in your taillight, contact cement some
aluminum foil in the housing (shiney side out!) to make it reflect the light
better. This (cheaper) mod will make the taillights a whole lot brighter
than some LED is going to.

If someone finds some LED's that work better than the regular bulb with a
good reflector, post a side by side pic and i'll eat my words.

Just my measly experience.  ;-)

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; Um, but the website also says this:
&gt;      &quot;LED bulbs are generally not as bright as standard incandescent
bulbs,
&gt; they
&gt;       have many advantages over filament bulbs (longer life, faster on/off
&gt; times,
&gt;      lower power consumption, more vivid colors) but brightness is not one
&gt; of them&quot;
&gt;
&gt; So...  are they brighter or just more fun?
&gt; Sorry, just looking for clarification before I run out and buy them...
they
&gt; do look cool though...
