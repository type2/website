Is far as I know the Dormobile roof is a patented design of the Martin Walter company.
The Dormobile conversion was applied to other vehicles such as Land Rovers and 
COMMER and Ford vans. There is a Dormobile club covering all these vehicles.
Martin Walter licensed the elevating roof design to other conversion companies, 
which is why you find them on Westies and other conversions. 

He had lots of other interesting ideas, you ought to see an early 60's Dormobile 
Split intact. The 'Dormatic' seats tilt and swivel to about a dozen different positions!

Wish my girlfriend did.......

 ...
 &gt;I thought Dormobile and Westfalia were mutually exclusive
&gt;conversions...

Thom,

There were 2 different Dormoblies...  Westfalia Werk put Dormobile
camper tops with Westfalia interiors for the European &amp; Canadian
markets and Martin Walter (Walker?) put Dormobile tops on buses
in England.

I am sending this from my home account, but you may forward it to the
list if you think it is important.

Dave
