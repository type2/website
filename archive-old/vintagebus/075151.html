Subject: Back on the road, thanks to integrity, craftmanship, and
  perfect customer service.

Many of you have read about my unfortunate experiences dealing with a
particular vendor last year in western PA. Last fall I went about to find a
replacement for the evil mill, and happend into Ronnie of OldVolks, he built
me a wonderful longblock, but I suffered tuning/idle problems which plaged
me. June came along and I gave up, returning the poorly idling motor back to
him so he could figure out what was wrong.
After much measuring and remeasuring and tearing down, he finds the cam was
stamped wrong at the Engle factory, and my little stock 1600 has a z35
squished in there, happiliy stamped a 100! Engle told us to take a hike and
it was our problem...
Ronnie rebuilt the entire engine, had the heads done over better than stock,
the engine DYNOed, and shipped back to me in a few weeks after debugging the
problem, the cam fiasco forced him to bascially blueprint a stock mill.
Total cost? A carb he shipped me for free back in April was paid for....
This balanced CW 1600 runs like a top, and starts so fast its amazing.
Where others have left me high and dry and busless, Ronnie/OldVolks cared
about his customer, and made things right.
Thanks Ronnie,

Al
