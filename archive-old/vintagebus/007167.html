Chris,
    I bought a rear seat from a guy who said it came out of his bay.
    I have a 66. It fitted using the little widgets into the keyhole
slotettes in the
floor.
     No rear brackets came with it, but the holes were perfectly aligned
for a simple L bracket ,  A snug width fit so I would say yes.
 The only doubt in my mind being the fact that I never saw it fitted in the
bay window bus.
