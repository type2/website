About a week ago I posted that I was needing some help locating a
Westfalia Pop Top around the Midwest region.  Well, my search has
ended.  I have found my perfect Westy.  I had to drive two states but I
was worth every mile.  I just wanted to take a second and thank everyone
who sent me replys and phone numbers.  I was really impressed with
amount of response I received.  Thank You All!
