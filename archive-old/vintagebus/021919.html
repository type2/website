Hi,

I am trying to figure out what kind of tranny a bus has. I am looking at
buying a 64 Sundial that has a 1600sp in it. What might that imply about the
tranny and diff? It is not actually very clear to me from past threads
whether or not one could put a 12V 1600 straight onto a old 6V setup. I am
trying to figure out if it has a 4.125 or 4.375 R&amp;P. Is there something
about the tranny that gives it away (assuming the one of the PO's did not
split it and swap the R&amp;P)?

Thanks
Bob
