Well according to the general consensus of those that have responded on the
list to the Kustom Panel, sounds like Binz is a hack, being that it isn't VW
made, just some aftermarket company hacking a bus into something it wasn't
meant to be. The same must go for the bestalwagon (spelling) another
aftermarket thing. Everybody has there taste, wants and  feelings,
expressions etc. Most people think there buses are priceless, I do of my DD,
but to chastiz a person for doing something they enjoy, ripping on them for
asking such a high price, would you give your stuff away, or would you try
to get what YOU feel it is worth, not what the &quot;MARKET&quot; dictates. If you
want something bad enough you'll pay whatever it takes. I just had a
conversation with a good friend (owns a body shop) about prices. I need a
door for the new/old diesel Ford bus hauler I just bought. $88.00 dollars
for a Taiwan door shell, $145.00 for a better repo and $250.00 from F#rd or
$150.00 for used. Then I thought to myself about the bitching people do when
they have to pay $100.00 dollars for an absolutly MINT pre 62 bus door,
that's a perfect 40 plus year old door! where's the logic. This logic people
use always seems to get to me. What qualifies a Kustom, reconditioned,
restored, perfect restoration, 100% original, driver, show bus. Somebody
please lay down the rules!! I guess Kelly Park will be the defining factor
to this question by what they will allow and won't into the show. I'd hate
to be the person deciding if a bus is custom or not. Thom's panel is a
custom, isn't it. Bright yellow paint, filled in back window, tent, none of
this original to the bus. So according to what most people are saying,
anything none stock would be classified a custom, if it isn't pure stock,
i.e.; engine, trans, tires, etc. Let everybody be themselves, enjoying there
buses and helping the hobby grow, regardless of your or my likes and
dislikes.

I can't resist a good street fight, so I'll wade into the fray.

As I've said before, the problem with doing a kustom kar - 
irrespective of how meticulous the craftsmanship - is that
to sell it, you have to find someone with almost the exact
tastes.   Do your car the way *you* want to, to make yourself
happy.  When the time comes to sell, you have the choice of
sucking up and taking the loss, or holding out until you get
the right buyer, or a combination of the two.  Flak is inevitable.
Even if you had a perfectly OG, 100 pt concours '51 deluxe for
sale, *someone* is going to shovel a ration your way for 
some particular reason.

The second biggest problem with kustoms is cash: you will NEVER
get your money back out of it.  Heck, that can be said for
normal restos.  What lesson have we learned kids?  The ONLY
way to make money restoring cars is to charge by the hour
to do the work for other people on their cars.  That's why
most of the bus traders you see don't hardly do a lick of work on the 
cars that pass thru their hands; work means parts, parts means
expense, expense means less profit.  Even if I do &quot;flip&quot; the
'55 single I recently bought, it will leave my hands with new
brakes, tie rods, drag link, bumpers, correct bubble taillights,
new springs, mirrors, a tune-up, etc.  I probably wouldn't make a 
dime on it.

I ran into this when I sold my '56.  I'd installed a sunroof
clip and bits of a late-model camper conversion.  I caught
lots of flak for it being incorrect in those regards, and
the two-tone paint job.  But eventually I found someone - or
they found me - who thought my bus was exactly what he
wanted, and he's still tooling it around arizona to this day.

My '54 has *tons* of incorrect welding on it.  Sure, the pieces
are lined up where the should be - or close to it - but 
most of the body metal is NOS replacement or repro.  Enough 
of it has been replaced that it could be considered custom.
So what?  That's what I had to do to build the bus I wanted.
If I ever go to sell it, and someone wants to give me flak
for the bead welds where there should be spot welds, or how
the bulkhead section consists of pieces from 3 different buses
plus my own hand-fabbed sections - tough.  It's obviously not
the car they're looking for, so move along, nothing to see here.
But I will also have no business whining if I can't get
super top dollar, because I made the decision to use repro
metal instead of waiting for NOS pieces to come available.  I 
traded originality for time, and must live with that decision.

Then again, I don't think that a lot of the people that whine
about incorrect or compromise restorations have the wherewithall
to step up and give a better example.  I see a lot of bus
&quot;enthusiasts&quot; who will only buy the creme de la creme - only
to turn it as fast as possible.

Ellis' bus was somewhat kustom, but not as bad as some I've seen.
I think the main thing that scared people away was that it was
an ambulance, therefore not really a &quot;barndoor&quot;

I'm honestly surprised I don't get more flak on my '60 double-door.
Repro safaris, repro mirror arms, homemade rear hatch, etc, etc.

From a uniqness standpoint, I think the DD n-window bus is 
interesting.  I think it would have been fine if he hadn't
lowered it (airbags) which to me takes it to the ghetto-cruiser
level.  From a funcionality standpoint, the double-doors and
sunroof would have made it second only to a single-cab for
hauling capacity.
