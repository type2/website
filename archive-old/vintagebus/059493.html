Subject: Re: [VB] 58 bus on ebay

&gt;Wow, you guys call that bad?  Come to the northeast and try to find a good
&gt;bus to restore, we'd be lucky to find something like that! The things some
&gt;people will part out......

You got me wrong. I absolutely WOULD NOT part that bus out. But I 
also WOULD NOT pay $200 for it. Too much work to be done to be worth 
it to me. $50-$100 would MAYBE work for me...but I don't need it, so 
I try not to even consider it.
