Hi Dan,
Sounds like your idling mixture is too rich.  So you need to adjust the 
mixture screw and/or go to a smaller pilot jet.  Also a really way too big of 
main jet can cause this also.
  The accerator nozzle only affects going from idle to faster RPMs, not when 
going down to a idle.  Eric&amp;Barb
