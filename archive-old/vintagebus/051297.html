Yes, I did give up.  After chatting with Stan last week, I/we came to the
conclusion that maybe such a diagram didn't exist, so I changed the page
to eliminate the hole.  How can I talk you into a scan of your supplement?

&gt; those 3 months. Looks like Thoms diagram listing is now incorrect - he
&gt; changed it. It used to have an empty spot where the 56 thru mid 57 USA
&gt; diagram would go. Now i see 56- 61 USA, thats wrong. Did you give up on the
&gt; search thom?
&gt; should have:
&gt; 55-56 non usa
&gt; 55-56 usa
&gt; 56-mid57 usa
&gt; 56-mid57 non usa.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have a 56-mid57 usa diagram that is a supplement to the 55-56 diagram.
&gt; It simply shows only the new wiring added to US buses for bullets and dual
&gt; filaments taillights.
