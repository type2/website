this was a weekend hwere i learned a lot. for christmas, all i asked for
from my parents was a new Bible and money to work on my bus. they came
through. so i decided it would probably be a good idea to get new spark
plugs, wires, and a new distributor cap. we luckily had our present-opening
gala on friday mornng, so i had enough time to go grab the parts. this was
the first time tackling this particular job. silly me didn't replace one
wire at a time. i thought, since i was replacing the cap too, i'll just hook
the new wires to the new cap and just swap 'em out. well, i tried to
remember which wires went where, but failed to do so. so i ended up staring
at pics of vw engines that i had in books, trying to figure it out, just to
be unsuccessful. so i asked my mechanic uncle about how to figure it out. he
said if i knew which cylerder was which, what the firing order was, and
where the timing mark was, i could just figure it out by rotating the
flywheel and watching the rotor in the distributor to see where it lined up,
which i also replaced (i knew there was something else). i did just that and
started her up and it ran like a dream! except it needs a valve adjustment
really bad. 

this is something that i need a little help on. i'm going to pick up some
valve cover gaskets today during lunch. as well as a new fan belt after
reading kevin's email about his trip. i have never adjusted the valves
before, only seen it done. i guess i'm kind of a rookie at this mechanic
stuff. what i need to know is where do you measure? you got the springs on
the top side, and then the lower part. do i stick the feeler gauge between
the lower part of the valves or the upper? i have been re-reading the
previous posts (last week) about valve adjustments and they have helped a
lot. so don't feel like you have to re-itterate some points discussed
earlier. but any help would be much appreciated. maybe a step-by-step would
help me out the best.

so far i am starting to beleive. believe that these things aren't that hard
to fix yourself. i just had to get over the fear of messing something up and
also realize that almost any error can be corrected. of course, this list
has helped a tremendous amount! thanks everyone for you input!

p.s. - mmy 11 year old sister got me a new b**tle tee shirt that says &quot;bah
humbug!&quot; my 18 year old sister said that i should get one that says &quot;bah
humBUS!&quot; i thought that was a good idea. another friend also scored me a
shirt off of ebay that has a picture of the front of a kombi on the front
and the back of it on the back! i think it's awesome.
