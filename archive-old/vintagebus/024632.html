Subject: Dual Kadrons

My brother had me buy dual Kadrons for him from a guy local to me.

They are never-used, never-installed and originally purchased from Gene
Berg, 9 years ago.

The instructions that are with it (from Berg) talk about adjusting etc
but don't talk
about how the heck the parts go together.

If anyone has instructions on the linkage etc, please let me know.

Thanks,
...Markus
