&gt; Some might remember that I posted to the list saying I had cut the wires,
&gt; thinking the lights a PO hack.  That's still true.  I was going to put it all
&gt; back, when I arrived at a thought -- why not put quick-disconnects on the 
&gt; wiring so I can take off the bumper without cutting the wires?  The thing is,
&gt; the disconnects must lie outside and exposed to the elements, because they will
&gt; not fit through the small hole in the body allocated for the wires.  I have
&gt; some &quot;insulated&quot; ones, completely covered in plastic that seem pretty tight
&gt; together.

You might try bullet connectors such as those used on Japanese cars.  The
male part is quite small and may fit through the hole in the body,
particularly if you use heat-shrink tubing to insulate it.  Use
heat-shrink over the whole female part and it too will be completely
insulated so that you can keep the connector inside the body.
