Kelly is right but I would add that the back of the bus needs to be looked at with a magnifying glass. If this is like the busses I see in the junk yards, then the frame is rotting from sitting in or near the mud for a long time. Poke that puppy hard with a good stout screw driver especially near the torsion bar tube. If all is well and there are no cracks then go for it.

Good luck and I'm pulling for a resurrection.
