As a BH fan, I can sympathize with his concerns. I think that the website
needs to EMPHASIZE the copyrights of the viewer visiting it. Really
explain it clearly, and in depth, or something similar, so that folks
understand what their useage rights are and are not. Then there should be
fewer abuses and such.
