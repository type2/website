Subject: 12 volt BN-4

If anybody has a 12 bus heater they are looking to sell, I have a friend
that needs it. Getting down into the 90's here in Phoenix, and we don't want
to wait much longer. Preferably a BN-4, and preferably complete. The less it
has the more it needs to be a BN-4. Let me know and I'll connect you up.

Thanks,

Kyle
