Subject: 40 IDF problem - Any suggestions?
Date: Thu, 27 Jul 2000 19:37:38 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I haven't set foot in the shop for a few days but I wanted to update all of
you and especially you gurus on my carb situation.

As you may recall, I've taken some 40 IDF's, jetted them for a 1776 with 110
cam and stock heads, and installed CB Performance's vernturi mod kit.

The problem is fuel being supplied to the carb via the accelerator jets
during idle.  You can see the little spurts at idle with each intake stroke.
Dick Bozarth of Omaha, NE is helping me out.  He was able to talk to Rick
Tomlinson at CB and talk to his son at RMMW and here is the reply that the
honorable and knowledgeable Dick Bozarth sent me:
============================================================================
==================
Good evening,

Erin, I called again this morning to CB Performance and got to talk with
&quot;the
man&quot; Rick Tomlinson, hisself. His thoughts on the subject were that it
appeared to be the same probllem that he's encountered often in the past
with
earlier model IDF's. His thoughts were that the cam for the accelerator pump
has no gap, or slack, in it and the vibration of the engine at idle is
causing the cam to tickle the accelerator pump arm and thereby causing the
nozzles to squirt fuel onto the tops of the throttle plates. He thought that
by holding the cam at idle and keeeping it away from the acceleerator pump
arm it would cause the squirting to stop. Want to give it a try and let me
know what happens. I let him know I was a little skeptical about all of
this,
but at the same time had to agree that this is nothing that would have
resulted from the installation of his spray bar kit. He repeated his comment
that it was a pretty common problem with the earlier model and that we
should
give his idea a try and report back to him. So, there you have it for
today.I
guess all we can do is give his idea a try and go from there.

I also talked with my son, Dick, at Motorworks today about the problem and
his thought was that there might be excessive fuel pump pressure to the carb
s
that is forcing the main needles off their seats and allowing excessive fuel
into the carb bowls. He asked about the size of the main needle and seat and
I'm afraid I couldn't remember. I DO remember looking at the number on the
side of the seat one of the times the carb top was off, but I don't remember
the number that was there. He also made the suggestion of placing another
gasket beneath the fuel pump to reduce the pressire a bit.

Thus concludes my report for the day. Good luck. Be sure to tell me how all
these things work out.

Dick
===========================

I'm going to try these things out but I would appreciate hearing from any of
you gurus on the subject.  Thanks!

Erin
