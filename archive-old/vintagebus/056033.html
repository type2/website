Subject: leaving tonight

From Harrison, Arkansas, going to Auburn Hills via Chicago. I have the
double cab on the trailer----- yes, I know, you're supposed to drive your
bus, but it would be kinda cramped for 4 of us and 2 dogs, 'specially for
sleeping!!
We're pullin' it with the fo#d motorhome. 1st trip out with it. I hope that
v10 gas hog has enough power to pull it.
Sonney
