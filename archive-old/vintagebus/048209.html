&lt;&lt; This weekend I went to put the gate latches on my double cab and found that
 they are really stiff... What's the best way to loosen them up. &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Use penetrating oil daily or at least weekly until they start to loosen up 
with use.  From there on oil them with 30WT oil every couple of months with 
all the other hindges on your truck.  Eric&amp;Barb
