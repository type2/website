Subject: To Cut or Not to Cut???

During the paint job a few things are popping up other than the few dents I 
had.

1st Question:
OK, I know the general concensus is not to cut the dash to fit a new single 
din type radio in there.  I have seen ppl literally cringe at the site of 
it.  But where am I to place a decent stereo?  Under the seat (how does one 
change the station)?  Under the dash in a box (current configuration), is a 
bit unsightly w/ 2 radios.  Has anyone seen a radio mounted overhead? like 
under the vent?  I really don't want to cut the dash, but..........  This 
new Blaupunkt CD player needs to blend in.

2nd Question:
What do I need to do to get a type one tranny under my bus?  I have the 69 
Beetle tranny, or rather its waiting for me to decide.

3rd Question:
A new paint job deserves a new motor?????  I have a 1600dp w/ a pair of baby 
Del's recently rebuilt.  Have the German exhaust and headers, big oil pump, 
but it's still quite.... well.... slow and hot.  There's a bus on ebay with 
a 911 in it (WOW, he's letting it go for 4500) thats too pricey for me.  So 
here are my options, build/buy a 1776? Get a type 4 motor or a 912 motor?  
Anyway should I stick with the 1600 and a new tranny or go for something 
bigger?

4th Question:
With the installation of the new tranny the rear will sit considerably 
lower, if I install bug disc brakes in the front will that lower it and what 
does it take to do that?

Sorry bout all the questions, but decision making time is upon me.

BTW:  Rebuilding the sundial interior w/ all new wood is a bitch, they were 
quite crafty in making this stuff, but some improvments are needed(like 
using real wood).
