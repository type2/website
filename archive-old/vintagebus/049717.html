&gt;&lt;&lt; Can someone tell me what the correct decklid would be on a 57 single cab?
&gt; I've seen them in photos with and without the 3rd brakelight.  Which one is
&gt; correct?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;depends on when your bus was made.
&gt;
&gt;the center brake light (only, not third) was dropped in favor of two brake
&gt;lights as of  5th april 1957 at chassis number 246 964.   The deck lid used
&gt;for about 100 000 more buses was flat above the liscense plate area, not
&gt;humped like the 59 and later ones.
&gt;
Also depends on what market your bus was made for

I recently sold a double door panel built on 7 October 1957 which had
semaphores and the centre brake light (don't have VIN on hand). Wolfsburg
said it was shipped to Rhodesia.

PS: The Brazilian splitties like my 75 panel all had the flat (not 'humped'
or brake light) deck lids.
