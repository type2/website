What is the collective wisdom on the knock-off wrenches for the rear
axle nut? You know, the ones that you hit with a small sledge to turn? I
carry one in my road kit, since I don't carry an impact gun. But given
the choice I use a socket and impact.

Do the knock-off wrenches cause problems if used exclusively?
(I've never had any problems with them, but again, use them only when
absolutely necessary)

I use one.  Theory is the impact can damage bearings or whatever in the rear
axle assembly.  But I don't think I have had problems so far.   Then again I
don't take that nut off very often.    I lost the 46mm socket in a split up
and never have replaced it, but will get one and one road trips take it with
the 36mm one as well (FW nut) on the 1/2 drive slide bar and the 6&quot; cheater
pipe.     I never had to use it on a road trip one my own vehicle so far, but
it has come in handy.
