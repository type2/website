Subject: Re: [VB] Fan and alternator problems

there are several varieties of backing plates and hubs.  If you mix it up 
wrong, the offset will be wrong, Ie, the gen pulley won't be straight with the 
crank pulley, making the fan belt wear funny and die a tragic death after a 
short unhappy life being made to work in unsafe conditions.  So if you are 
changing the plate over, examine it carefully to see if it is the same.

If you are planning on installing a generator, it should fit fine with its 
tin.  You do have to make sure the fan is the same as the old one, ie if the old 
one was doghouse, the new one should be too, as that means you have the 
doghouse set up already.  Make sure you put the voltage regulator in too!

You can run a generator on an alternator stand.  Though can't run an 
alternator on a generator stand (w/o mods that is).

hope that helps.

 discovered that the fan had torn loose from the hub,
 which was still tightly fastened under the nut on the
 alternator shaft.  Well, before we were done we found
 damage to the alternator, and the fan had done some
 damage to the backing plate or whatever you call the
 removable pieces in the fan housing between the
 alternator and the fan.  
 
 So--my question is, can I use the fan and backing
 plate from spare generator equipped engines that I
 have around, or must these parts be from an alternator
 equipped engine?  I realize that the
 alternator/generator tower would have to be changed,
 but would anything else?
