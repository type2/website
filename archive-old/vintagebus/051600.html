Subject: RE: Antenna location


 I have mine mounted over my emblem on the center of
the nose section. It clears the safari's and aids in
keeping the emblem on the bus!

&gt; Is there a &quot;correct&quot; location for a radio antenna,
&gt; or were they just
&gt; installed wherever the dealership felt like that

&gt; often either center of the nose emblem or on the
&gt; passenger side of the
&gt; nose, any good reason to pick one location over the
&gt; other?
