    I am trying to find out what the original camper equiptment should be in 
this 67. I like the stuff in my 72 and was kinda hoping most of it was stock 
for 67 as well, for that could save me some serious cash Im sure. 
    I have the center pop-top, but what is it for? I know the later models 
have either a cot or a bed up there, but there is no imaginable way someone 
could sleep up in this thing. Is it just so you have room to stand up? 
    Where is the best supplier for like the window seals and such and is it 
true that the 67 has a one year only master cylinder that is in the $200 
range?
    
=  ==  == = 
yes the small pop top is for standing up in, not for sleeping in. 

the kit yours came with was probably a s042 kit, which is verysimilar to the 
72 westys you often see, with the Z-bed, blind spot closet/cabinet, 
headnager/fold up table/rear facing seat behind driver, ice box behind 
passneger.

but it was different.   for one, the blind spot cabinet is longer in the 68 
and ons, , it can be made to fit with some measureing and woodworking, if 
that is your plan.   the splitty icebox came with water tanks and pumps, but 
no sinks.   The handles are a different shape (but functoially 
interchangable)  All the construction is somewhat different, and it will be 
clear to someone who knows splittys so-42s tht you have a bay kit, but if the 
purpose is to have a camper kit and perfect anal restoration is not a 
priority, yes you can use the bay kit with mods to the blind spot cabinet.    
  

There are several suplliers for window seals, the best known are Wolfsberg 
West, and WCM.    Both companies make and sell many parts for buses.  The WW 
peple really know their stuff.  Richard at WW has a nice velvet green 66 
(65?67?) westy he drives.

Yes the 67 master cylinder is one year only, and costlier.   except for the 
first 15K or so 67s.   does your has the later or the earlier kind?  What is 
your VIN?  is the MC bad?   if it is good you dont need a new one.   flushing 
the brake system every coupler years helps preserve brake components.

If you look behind the pass seat there should be a 2&quot;x3&quot; metal tag screwed on 
there.  Copy every thing on it down, and go to the decoder on the 
vintagebus_dot_com webpage, which will reveal wonderful info such as your buses 
birthday, what options it came with (as in which version of the westy set 
up), where it was sent, etc.
