Subject: RE: [VB] Funny trans noise

Not really, it is just starting to go away, it's cold out so the grease
inside is harder. When you put pressure on it the noise will go away. The
one in my DD has been doing that for the last few thisand miles, just to
lazy to pull the engine to fix.

Urm, but the noise went away when I pushed on the clutch; the TOB
should not be doing anything at that point.

&gt; Throw out bearing

&gt; My bus has developed a funny trans noise, and it's almost funny
&gt; as in 'ha ha!' funny.  I was at a light this AM, out of gear,
&gt; foot off the clutch, and I revved it a little to get some heat
&gt; flowing.  It started making a Three Stooges sort of &quot;woo-woo-woo!&quot;
&gt; sound, which gave me a little giggle, even though I know it's not
&gt; a good thing.  The noise went away when I put the clutch in.
