Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-15-03

After taking a step backwards this past weekend when I lost my turn 
signals, I decided to work on something else today.

I ended up hooking up the fuel line from the gas tank to the engine. 
I put one fuel filter after the gas tank and metal fuel line and then 
another one after the fuel pump. I dumped my full lawnmower gas can 
into the tank and fired the engine up. All is well. One funny thing 
was the filter after the fuel pump ended up with some crud in it. I 
was expecting the filter earlier down the line to be the one to get 
some gunk. But it ended up staying pretty clean...right off the bat 
at least.

I decided it was also time to put an air filter on the carb. I just 
so happened to have bought an early bus oil bath air cleaner that I 
didn't need and still had in the stash. It's real funny how these 
little items I picked up for a few dollars here or there have really 
saved me on this project. When I buy them sometimes my friends ask 
what I need it for and I just say it's a good deal and leave it at 
that. Makes sense now though.

I cleaned the oil bath air filter up real good and ended up replacing 
the mounting clamp that goes on the carb side. After all that I 
filled it with oil and installed it. Engine ran good with it on 
there. But I still have to install a magic triangle mount on the fan 
shroud to support the main part of the filter. I didn't have one 
handy, my buddy probably has tons at his shop. I guess I'll go there 
tomorrow and return his gas can that was being used for this truck's 
fuel and snag a triangle mount while I'm there.

That was about it tonight. Doesn't seem like much but it did take a 
little while. And it really was therapeutic today for whatever 
reason. That's what it's all about anyway...right?
