Subject: Re: [VB] For the record: &quot;new&quot; king pin tolerance makes it  
  difficult to  grease

Hey, thanks for pointing that out. Yup, I looked at
all my copies of without guesswork too. Saw the same
thing. But nowhere did I see the .15mm spec, other
than in service books, and that was a spec not to
exceed, and that was up/down of the lower
kingpin/spacer.
Like I said, I personally like to cut mine by .01mm at
a time after I know the kingpin will fit through on
the next cut, and that seems to fall in line with the
.02-.03mm spec listed on the links you posted.
