&gt; i thought i would let everyone know that i just got a really nice
&gt; hatch seal off eBay from some place in Cali called ISP West. found one on
eBay a few
&gt; weeks ago and lost out at the last minute... saw this one a
&gt; couple weeks ago and got it for $61.50.


Is this for a '63-down bus or '64-up?  If for '64-up, something does seem
odd there.  Is this seal made of three sections glued together? If so, is
one section a slightly different color than the others?
