Hi list,
Does anyone out there have any information about interior dyes?  I am looking 
for a way to get rid of the yellowed portions of my Mesh Platinum interior.  
It is the platinum/gold looking salt and pepper style interior from 65-67 
deluxe buses with the titian red/ beige grey exterior color combo.  I know 
this is the least favorite interior of many people,  but it is original to 
the bus and oh so nice and complete.
So,  my questions are:
1.  is there a platinum dye out there?
2.  do I need to use a dye primer to cover the yellowed areas?
3.  does anyone have a source for these in the correct platinum color?
4.  I know salt and pepper material is being reproduced,  how about platinum?

Thank you for your help
