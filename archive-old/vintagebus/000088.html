Stephan, Pete, Split List,

Ferrous oxidation? Mr. eletro-chemistry is back.

To remove rust in my shop (no powdercoating, plating, or galvanizing 
facilities - see elsewhere for these options), I use, (in order of 
preference):

1. SANDBLAST - IF you can get to the rust (not inside a door panel, or an 
inaccessible cranny for example), IF you don't care about or take steps to 
prevent the abrasive from betting EVERYWHERE, and IF you have a sandblaster.  
NOTHING beats sandblasting, and as for elbow grease, there ain't none 
involved.  I use DuPont StarBlast.

2. ELECTROLYSIS - IF you can fully immerse the part and the surfaces you want 
to remove the rust from is able to be in direct line-of-sight with the anodes 
(again won't get inside a door panel unless you can put an anode in there 
without shorting the electrolyte). See list archives.
 
3. FRIENDLY CHEMICALS - Somewhat expensive, I use Ecotec 
(http://www.essex3_dot_com/slabs/metlmain.htm) which is based on citric acid.  
This stuff works and won't hurt you.  Simple Solutions (R.R.5 Box 283G 
Gravois Mills, MO 65037 573-374-1746 FAX 573-374-4972) is cheeper but does 
not work as good.

4. NASTY CHEMICALS - About 400 (exaggeration) products which are acid based 
(phosphoric, muratic, hydrochloric, hydroxyacetic, sulfamic).  Full immersion 
is best.  Rass-O-Nil (http://www.icpi_dot_net/rassonil.htm), Ospho (True value 
hardware - Skybryte Co.  3125 Perkins Ave  Cleveland, OH 44114, phone 216 
771-1590), CLR, Rust-Mort, Mirachem 250, Envirosolve 1000, MP-7, Naval Jelly, 
Metal Ready, Miracle Rust Remover, Oxysolv, Dupont 5717S, Neutra-rust, and 
the list goes on.  Basically a 10 to 30% solution of phosphoric acid will 
remove rust.  More on Magnite, Ferrous trioxide (the black stuff left over) 
in December.  Some of these chemicals have zinc phosphate (Dupont 5718S, 
Rass-O-Nil, Metal Ready) which help protect the metal after removal.

5. WIRE BRUSH - a compliment to any of the above, except sandblasting.  Used 
alone, won't get all the rust, so you will have to use POR15.  Actually only 
sandblasting gets &quot;all&quot; the rust, but even sandblasting will leave micro rust 
down deep in heavy rust unless you sandblast to china, but then there is no 
metal left (baby-bathwater thing).

6. CRAP - Do not use these in any case: Extend, Rust-X, One-Step.  Try them 
on some rusty metal and then scrape it off.  Nice rust huh?  I could do 
better with black shoe polish.  (if you can't get the metal rust free, use 
POR15 unless you have to weld it afterwards then use 3M weld thru primer and 
cross your fingers)

Web page with pictures of results coming in mid-December (my last deadline 
was August 1998). Something about the time consumption of restoration was 
mentioned?  Hopefully this will hold you till then, and stir up the list.  

Coating bare metal is another thread but the short is 1) 3M weld thru if you 
have to weld it later, 2) ZRC on rust free where looks don't matter (good for 
seat springs, Pete) 3) POR15 on semi-rusty, 4) self-etch primer (Dupont 
Variprime or PPG DX1791) where looks do matter, and you will be coating with 
urethane primer and have a fresh air respirator, otherwise if looks matter 
(and/or if body filler is required) use DuPont Prime-N-Seal or PPG DP-Epoxy.  
I don't know about Glasurit (sic) paints but they have comparable products, 
5) Powdercoat if you wish (good for wheels, Stephan) , 6) Plate or Galvanize 
if you wish (also agree with Barb&amp;Eric that this would be good for the seat 
springs, Pete, if you got the urge).

Does that confuse things more?
