Good day list...

Does anyone know somebody that may have some parts for sale for my 67 
Deluxe?
I'm just re-doing my list of parts that I need and I am pretty well 
set.(well kinda..)
I am having trouble though, finding the rear and middle seats for the &quot;rear&quot; 
area of my bus. I have a front seat that is in great shape but there were no 
back seats in the bus when I got it. Why the heck do people take them out 
and seem to never put them back in?!
I live in Vancouver BC so if anyone knows of any parts in the 
Washington,Oregon or BC area- any help would be much appreciated.
- and hey Thom, when are you going to start that new project......?

Andy
