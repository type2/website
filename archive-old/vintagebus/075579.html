Subject: Re: Compression Ratio (again)

&gt;OK. I never did get a good solid answer on the compression ratio for
&gt;my engine. This is what I have: 78 mm crank, 90.5 mm P/C, big valve
&gt;heads (40x37.5) with oval ports polished and matched to manifolds,
&gt;Weber dual 42 DCNFs,Engle 110 cam, I plan to run a deck height about
&gt;0.050 - 0.060.  WHAT COMPRESSION RATIO WOULD YOU RUN WITH THIS
&gt;COMBINATION?

Disclaimer: I have no personal experience, only what I read.

Gene Berg was pretty adamant about keeping the CR down for street
engines on pump gas, claiming 91-octane premium &quot;will just barely
support 7.0:1&quot; and that 6.6:1 was best for regular.  The &quot;High
Performance&quot; chapter by Colin Messer in later editions of the
Idiot manual recommends a 6.5:1 max for regular gas.  The Strength-
through-Joy Car Factory peaked out at 8.5:1 on leaded 95 RON gas
in 1966; starting in 1970 they used a max of 7.7:1 on 91 RON and
8.2:1 on 98 RON leaded.  (RON is approximately 5 more than the
number on the pump in the US, so 91 RON ~= &quot;86 octane&quot; and 98 RON
~= &quot;93 octane&quot;.)

Depending on what gas you can get where you're at, it seems like
something between 7:1 and 8:1 might be good.  If you're willing
to run race gas, maybe 8.5:1 ?
