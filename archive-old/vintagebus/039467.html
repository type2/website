Found a stash of VW's near my home in a old wrecking yard.  I've lived here 
for about a year, and never really looked at the local wrecking yards for 
splitties.  Kinda stumbled upon this Saturday while yard saleing with the 
wife.  The guy still operates wrench turning, but not much on the end of the 
old wrecking yard out back anymore so I am told.  He is in the middle of 
crushing, and said I will have to wait a couple of weeks to look in his yard 
at the vw's he had.  He was not too helpful or anxious to let me in.  Buncha 
hicks.  I took a few pics from over the fence tho and posted them on 
photopoint for those interested.  See below.  I will report back in a couple 
of weeks once I have a chance (read that first dibs....)  at what is in 
there.  From what I see there are about 5 early, and a mishmash of loafs and 
bugs.  I did look at the 21 window out front that I was told was a 
customers.  They said there is no way it was for sale, that the owner has it 
there for some wiring and has it sold anyways when it gets done.  Its sad 
what has been done.  There is diamond plate for a cargo floor now. Sitting 
in the rain, all in pieces. Stupid hicks.
