&lt;&lt; Also does anyone have the prices of the CW 
 cranks that are good quality one piece, and welded cranks?  It would be 
 interesting to see how much $ differance there is. &gt;&gt;
Hi E&amp;B
Guess its back to me as I started this thread. The no name cranks seem to run 
in the 140-160$ range some with, some without core. If memory serves me right 
I think RMMW had Scat at 250$. Does anyone know if the scat unit is forged? 
Your right in your assumption, my goal is too build a mildly stressed 1776 
motor with everything balanced and assembled to closest tolerance. Also want 
it to breath which is why I asked about CB heads. I too would be interested 
in peoples personal experiences
