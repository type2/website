Greetings!

I used an S.O.S pad and it whitens great! make sure the pad is very wet and
soapy. Also great on whiting your white walls (or rings). An old timer gave
me the tip.

Just in the middle of doing about 27 different little jobs on my bus all at
the same time. Sound familiar?
Does anyone know of a product that works at making that old yellowed (but in
good condition, mind you)headliner turn white again? I have tried all sorts
of things - simple green, windex, fantastic etc. I don't want to try
something like TSP unless some of you have had good results without melting
the whole thing away into a smoking lump of 33 year old vinyl! Otherwise my
headliner is in stellar cond. So if anyone has found something that works,
please pass it along.

Thx
Andy
