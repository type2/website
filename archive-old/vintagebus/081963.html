Subject: 21 window wire harness

Dan,

when i did my 21 window there were no retaining tabs
thru the belly pan area.  Seams like there were some
both in front and back of that area but thru the pan
was a smooth run.  Seams to my like i heard there was
a tube that ran thru the belly pan area but i am not
sure.  

Have you tried both directions?  I would tie leaders
on both ends and try to work the opposite direction
you got stuck.

If you do loose the harness i would try a electrical
&quot;fish&quot; before i cut the pan open.

Hope that helps.
