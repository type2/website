I give up.  I've just spent a couple of hours digging in the Type 2 archives
and library, and coming up empty.

A while back someone posted the URL of a price guide for ancient veehickles.
Due to my March computer invasion/hack I've lost the message I'd saved with
the information.

Can anyone forward that information, or a copy of the relevant post?

Many thanks.....
