Subject: RE: [VB] M/C on '67

I'm sorry, I had assumed, but not understood, that the master cylinder
required was a dual circuit system. That's why I replied to the message. My
SC is a 67 with factory dual circuit. With the adapter kit, the holes on the
lines line up perfectly and the original resevoir plugs right in. Of course
you can use a Rabbit resevoir also, as both line up with the hole in the
floor.

But like I said, it's for a 67 van and SC/DC.

Raymond, the pics look as the stock pedal pan will not fit with mod  larger
24mm
piston 71-79 style
master cylinder with an adapter kit and how about filling the two break
reservoirs now?

whatever,
&gt; out of the VW Trends and Hot VW mags sells the adaptr kit for $39.95. I
&gt; bought the new master cylinder for $43.00 and had it all bolted in my SC
in
&gt; 20 minutes. The brake lines on my dual circuit 67 matched exactly with the
&gt; new master cylinder and the only other change was to lengthen the wires
the
&gt; the farthest brake light switch. I even took pics, go to vintagebus_dot_com
and
&gt; click on the gallery and the single cab catagory and my master cylinder
mod
&gt; pictures are on section 5 about the middle of the page. Good luck.
