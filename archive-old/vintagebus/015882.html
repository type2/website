Not to sound pretentious, but I have had and used
several types of tents. Lucky me, I fell into a few
prior to the VW &quot;technology stock&quot; type of rise in
prices.

64-67 Big Top &lt;no floor&gt; Manufactured by Greyhound
according to the label. Paula's favorite due to *not*
having a floor.
Paula and I use the thing with her '67 Westy and it's
bus mounted rails. I personally think its a bit of a
PITA to set up due to the canvas over the pole config.
Gotta be super careful not to rip anything on the
corner pole top securing studs. Mrs. and I have a
routine down and can set it up fairly quickly. Paid
$190.00 for at the end of the last SOTO meet held in
Escondito. Can you believe that it sat there for the
entire show? The seller wanted $250 and I even had to
borrow some bucks from D.Denlinger at that show to
secure the deal. $190 was all that I could scrape up
and the seller went for it! Try that one in today's
market. Thanks to Todd Swangstu for telling me that it
was at the show. I would have missed it. It's the only
one that I've ever seen at a swapmeet. &lt;its not FS&gt;.
Have used it for show as well as in real camping in a
suprise drenching rain/mud storm. Personally think
that the tent obscures the actual bus in shows. We (I)
dont really care that much anymore about the show
aspect.

68 Drive-away style 
My favorite due to ease of set up and inclusion of the
floor. We used this one with our former 83 Westy and
several other buses. Best for our real camping
adventures in my opinion. Doesnt need the hard to find
rain gutter tent attachment pieces.

California Awning/Sundial style
I use this with my 63 EZ camper. Seems to work fine
for shade w/o all of the hassle of a billion poles. Is
red and white striped like a &quot;Privy&quot; tent but without
the separate privy division. I like using it w/o the
side curtains. Great for swapmeet shade.

Personal opinion?
For affordable real camping usage I like the tent that
my buddies Buck and Laurie M, in Colorado bought for
their bay window. Paid about $89. at an end of season
sale at Target. Appropriate size for a bus and has a
hallway that leads to the sliding door. Also can't
beat the RV style awning that KyleT has on his Limo
bus. BAM! It's in the 'open bar' position in two
seconds. Point is that you dont have to spend a
fortune to get a tent that will work for real camping.
I have been lucky to have located two Westy tents over
the years at yard sales plus the one from the SOTO
show. My driveaway cost me $60. and came with a
Buickful of old school camping gear. Traded/plus cash
for the EZ awning from friends at Pomona years back. I
couldn't afford a real Westy tent at today's prices
but being the junkie that I am would love to find the
right tent for the Puck! &lt;I'm addicted&gt;
