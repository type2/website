Can someone explain to me how the generator is connected to the battery, 
voltage
regulator, and dash gen warning light?? What else is hooked up to the voltage 
regulator other than battery &amp; generator.
Hi John,
Best to go to the vintagebus_dot_com website or a VW Transporter Workshop Manual 
for 1963-67 bus and look up your year wiring diagram!  The generator is hooked 
by two wires to the regulator,  The regulator is hooked to the rest of the 
wiring by a large red wire which goes to the positive post on the starter 
solinoid where cables from the battery and fuse box originate from.  The blue with 
with stripe from the regulator goes to the idiot light in the dash where it 
ground through the light bulb.
  I put the voltmeter on the &quot;DF&quot; terminal when the engine is running and get 
nothing.  When I turn ignition switch on, the dash gen warning light does
NOT come on, but the bulb and ground at bulb holder are confirmed good. So I 
am assuming I have something hooked up wrong because the gen warning light 
should
come ON when key is on even if the generator is BAD, right???
Sounds like something is bad.  Check your wiring to the wiring diagram first 
to make sure you hooked everything up proper.  If that is fine, check that the 
regulator is grounded properly, after that it is a replace regulator and 
generator next.
