Get yourself an old 4x4 pick-em-up.  Put a good battery in it.  (It's gonna be
parked ALOT! You can't afford to drive it! 8-12 mpg) Put a cheap across bed
toolbox in it.  Keep the oil for the worn out Chevy engine in the toolbox. 
Keep the tow strap in the bus.

&gt; Hey folks, here's a question on behalf of my mom...
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I think she's got her heart set on getting rid of our Merkur and
&gt; getting a truck.  She feels it's time we own something that can tow any of
&gt; our VWs if they breakdown.  There are 4 people in our family, so we gotta
&gt; keep that in mind.  But I know a lot of listees have haulers that,
&gt; naturally, we all stay quiet about. &lt;g&gt;  But give us some
&gt; recommendations...what do you own? what do you like?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Taylor (and the rest of the Nelson family)
