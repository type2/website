Subject: drag link tools

Peeps
I want to replace my steering box and I dont want to kill myself this time
over the drag link.

Someone mentioned the Hazet 779-18 which there seems to be a cheaper
bugpack knock off of as well. but for 50.00 id go with the hazet.
Its made for the tie rods but it was said it will do the drag link as
well.

Steve D (happy passover steve) told me at EB02 that he has a set of
snap on 3 arm pullers and they deal with it.

Jon Hazetguy said he uses a 779 puller. I think this is a hazet 2 arm
puller I cant find it listed though.


I really want to avoid blood, bad language, big hammers, jacks,
penetrating oil, broken tools  and the acetylene torch
this time if I can.

open to the voice of experience.
