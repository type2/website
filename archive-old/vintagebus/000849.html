Jason,

I can't believe I'm doing this, but to quote the enigmatic &quot;Everywhere&quot; Ed
O'Donnel once again: &quot;The more shortcuts you take to save time, the more
time you waste until you do it right&quot;.

Count your losses on that Brazilian paper-weight you bought, and bite the
bullet and get a Leistrich.  No matter what.  F#$K fabricating and mangling
your bus to get a cheap, worthless muffler to fit.  It won't stay sealed (if
it ever does), and won't last 1/10 the time a good OEM one will. The muffler
shop of your choice will probably only make matters worse too.

&quot;Good luck finding a Leistrich&quot;!!??  What's up with that?  Any good VW shop
should be able to open up their parts book, and order one.  Sound like this
guy doesn't care enough about his customers to take the effort to sell them
quality products.  If I were you I'd find another shop to go to.  This one
has just demonstrated it's concern for quality.  If worse come to worse, you
can just walk into a VW dealer and ask for a muffler for a 71 Beetle or
something...  It would probably be the same replacement part, and you'd be
almost certain to get good German installation hardware there too.

Hell, even I can get one in a couple weeks, and I'm just a rink-dink garage
operation  here!

Take my advice:  I'd rather drive the Nike's for 2 weeks until the Leistrich
came in, than settle for some Brazilian shit that doesn't work and I'd just
have to replace again next year, if not sooner.

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW  &quot;In ten
years,
my car will still be a classic, yours will just be OLD.&quot;

Or my current favorite: &quot;Does YOUR car have a sink?&quot;
