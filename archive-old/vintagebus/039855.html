&gt;Jason, Adrian, George and Scott had questions,and
&gt;responses, regarding veggie oil/diesel fuel.  The
&gt;links Scott posted are about making veggie oil into a
&gt;diesel fuel substitue (popularly known as
&gt;&quot;bio-diesel&quot;) that will work in most (all?) diesel
&gt;engines with no changes to the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;In order to run straight unadulterated used vegetable
&gt;oil, the engine fuel system will need some
&gt;modifications, including a method of heating the oil
&gt;to keep it liquid enough to flow through the
&gt;injectors

Thanks for mentioning me. But I have only said refined biodiesel, not pure 
oil. I do not consider unrefined oil as an option. To work in most vehicles 
you have to refine it.
