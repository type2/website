Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Puzzler - Need Help

Bad contacts on the solenoid. Dozens of these throughout the years. Oh, and
you can throw in a couple of bad contacts on the start position of the
ignition switch too.

I first start out cleaning all the contacts for the ignition wiring,
including the coil and fuel shut off solenoid. Don't leave out the battery
posts.

If that doesn't work, I pull the starter motor and take the solenoid off and
clean the contacts on it. Taking the can apart is a pain sometimes because
of years of corrosion. I have a contact file I use to dress up the solenoid
contact. Having the starter case off gives you a chance to put a dab of
grease on the moving surfaces and check for bearing wear.

If that still doesn't work, check your wiring for a bad wire and/or replace
the starter.

  I have the same problem.  I try and park on a slope so that I can roll
start it.


&gt; ride around for 15-30 minutes, and when I shut the ignition off, it
&gt; will not restart. no noise, no starter, nothing.
