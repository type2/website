&lt;&lt; Ok, My bus starts after you give it a shot of gas, runs for a minute or so,
 then dies.You can keep it alive by goosing the gas pedal, but that is a 
tricky
 manuver going down a hill with a stop light at the bottom.  I forget where 
the
 idle adjustment is on the type 1 1600DP (74 bug) 
  &gt;&gt;


so, the engine runs as long as you keep bumping the gas pedal, but if you 
don't goose it it dies?  well your carberetter is dirty, I'd bet a donut.  is 
it a 34 pict?    they do that
