Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Slash rear bumper

oh...- the seals between uprights and blade- some people think they look 
sharp and hunt for them.  I like the rubber strips on the face of the 
uprights.

Never used a repro blade. so no clue on fit.

&lt;&lt; I meant; can you exchange original parts with the
 repro ones and have a good fit? My bumpers are ok
 originals but I have seen plenty bumpers with the
 black inserts around the uprights and wondered what it
 was there for. I always found it pretty ugly.
