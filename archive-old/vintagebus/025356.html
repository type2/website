&gt; number written DIRECTLY on the front of the bill. I was told 10DM is about
&gt; 20 bucks but I'm not sure.....


Ohh PLEASE!

Look in your newspaper. Currently its about 1.84DM per Dollar, so its
about $6.
And don't write on the bill.

Some people seem to expect all kind of secret information to come out of
this correspondence.
Especially for the US cars this is not so. The body ID plate will tell
you more than VW can in most instances.
Its more interesting for cars that went to exotic countries, but those
usually never made it to the US (the ID plate tells you if it went to
the US dirctly).

I once bought an unusually rustfree Bug in Germany, that had funny
velvetlike original seatcovers and strange electrics (ignition wired to
the taillights). It turned out to have been delivered to Iran.

I think it only makes sense to write to Wolfsburg if there is something
suspicious about your car, like it being 10 inches longer than it should
be.
