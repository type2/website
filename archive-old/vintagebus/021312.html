Hello, everyone,

The show is indeed over and it goes down in my mind as one of the better ones 
we've had in several years. Kudos go to Matt and all who gave so generously 
of their time to make this such a success.

And now, if I may, I'd like to ask a favor.

My son, Dick and I tried to put together a format for the classification and 
judging of the cars that was consistent with what some of the other larger 
shows are using. We hope that it met with your approval. But, in case that it 
didn't, or you'd like to suggest a change, would you please let me know now 
while it's still fresh in your mind. We can then tailor the classifications 
and classes to better suit the needs of the Omaha VW Club for future shows.

Thank you

Dick Bozarth (the older one)
