Subject: Re: side gear removal

&gt; From: Faster-Laster &lt;jason_at_fasterlaster_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any
&gt; suggestions for getting the blankty blank blank side gear out?
&gt;
E&amp;B gave me the suggestion of using a long punch to reach through and 
tap the one out on the far side.  It'll have to go thru at an angle.  
Didn't take a lot of force, just take a close look to see that you're 
hitting the right thang.  Then you can reach thru from the other side 
and knock out the near one.

Check the archives for posts from Clara and E&amp;B to me on my project, 
just in the past couple of weeks.  They (and others) have been loads of 
help.

I got the redux boxes back together this weekend and the whole schmeer 
is sitting in the carport behind the bus waiting for a couple of 
friends to come over and help me horse it back into place.  Not much 
longer to go now....
