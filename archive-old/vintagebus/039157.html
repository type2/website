Hello all

I got my 61 doublecab back from the panel shop today and I'm thrilled
off my face. The bus was with the panel shop  for about ten weeks and I
was going mad with anticipation. While the job isn't perfect it is damn
close. It has been sprayed black below the beltline and ivory above -
not original colours but more to my taste than the original dove blue /
grey. What is that colour called?

The sills/rockers were fabbed by the shop and the join between the outer
rocker panel and the inner rocker (where the drainage holes are) is a
bit rough. Pretty much everything else is perfect but I know that this
will bug me whenever I look at it.

Do the trims that were fitted to deluxe buses at the bottom of the
rocker cover the join? If they do then I'll import a set and save
another few weeks of aggravation.

TIA
Michael '61 doublecab (newly made over and much improved)
