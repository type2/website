FWIW.....

CNN covered &quot;Burning Man&quot; on the tube and with stories on CNN Interactive
[their online version].

If it's &quot;big enough&quot; for CNN it certainly ought to be big enough for the VW
rags.....

&gt;&gt;  I need to second Jim's annoyance with VW magazine publishers for
avoiding great, popular VW events like Jerome.  A VW bus camp that some
of you folks may have missed, but certainly the VW magazines have missed
is the VW Bus Camp at Burning Man.  &lt;&lt;
