well in my case of the 36hp case Lloyds (the insurance co. for ebay) told me
that the seller stated he would refund so they would not pay,   i told them
i had proof he would not refund and they did not care,  also if you are a
dishonest seller and want  to sell crap just list it as &quot;as is&quot;  and its an
out.  dont get me wrong there are great people on there that will admit to
there mistakes and take care of them,   i recently bought a nos taillight
bracket for my split bug 130.00 or so bucks, listed as a right,   when it
came it was a left,    i emailed the seller and he offered a full refund
with shipping both ways, and a refund on the r-housing i got from him ,
great guy  but i decided to keep it any way,   but at least the offer was
there.     john
