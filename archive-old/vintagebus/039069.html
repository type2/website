Subject: My thrust is shot - venting my frustration to the list.
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 14:34:02 -0500

I'm SCREWED!  

After discovering that the thrust surface of my case is smaller than
standard, I took it to my machinist.  He measured it and it has
apparently been cut to .060&quot;!  For those of you that don't know, they
don't MAKE a .060 thrust bearing - they're only available in .040 and
.080.  

So I think to myself, OK, so I'll have it cut to .080 - no problem.
Except that in order to do that, I have to have the case line-bored to
.040 (currently .020) AND have my brand-new cw crank turned to .010&quot;.
Because that's the closest bearing set that the make for a .080 thrust.

While the cost of all this will add over $100 to my escalating rebuild
cost, that's not my big concern.  My big concern is that after cutting
the case that much, I don't have any room for future rebuilds on it.
And it seems like it will weaken the case and shorten its life.

But since I've already spent the money to have the case bored out for
the 90.5 cylinders and drilled for full flow, I kind of hate to just
chunk it at this point.

Anyone know of any available bearing sets that would be a better
combination (like a .040 line, std crank, .080 thrust)?  Any serious
drawbacks to cutting a case for .040 line and .080 thrust?  What are
your informed opinions about how I should continue (other than that I
should have had my thrust measured before doing anything else)?
