Subject: Everybus Chili rules (oh yes, it does!)

Hey y'all
Since EB is just a couple weeks away, I thought it's time to post this
years strictly arbitrary and nonsensical rules.

1. No cheating (whatever that means).
2. An ingredients list is REQUIRED, spices can be listed as 'spices' but
things like wheat products, eggs, milk, or alcoholic beverages MUST be
listed.  Meats list is a good thing.  The ingredients list should also
have the team or cook's name so the international panel of judges can
award top marks to the deserving.
3. There will again be 3 classes, Meat, Meatless, and Side Dish.
4. All entries MUST be at the pavilion ready for judging no later than
4:30 to be considered for judging.  Otherwise it's a 'donation'.
5.  Most importantly - HAVE FUN!

Any questions please feel free to ask at this e-mail.
