I've tried to install a very simple tape deck in my by for which I had no 
installation instruction but could tell which wires were Power, lights etc. 
I installed it and had trouble getting it to run... ok it did nothing.  
Anyway it said on the casing to it &quot;Ground negative only&quot; and then I read in 
JCW about a converter for some huge amount of money that allowed you to use 
new accessories in older vehicles. (ground neg. verses old &quot;classic&quot; 
systems&quot; What is up with all this? Is the wiring so different on the bus 
that I can't install this without some converter or did I just screw up the 
wireing in the first place?

Scott
