Subject: Re: [VB] Ellis cant make OCTO/Classic Weekend

Sorry about your friend, and anyways, the Classic
isn't all that great. And OCTO happens more than once
a year.

&gt; I'm learning to understand that there is a reason

&gt; 
&gt; After missing Kelly Park, I most definitely wanted
&gt; to attend the OCTO/Classic
&gt; Weekend in the worst way. Seeing old friends and
&gt; getting away was looked
&gt; forward to.
&gt; 
&gt; Life and death issues keep me at home. Pending birth
&gt; of a son and anticipated
&gt; funeral of a life long friend. A million dollars
&gt; would not prevent me from
&gt; missing either one. Family/Friends first, VW's are
&gt; down the list at this point.
&gt; Thanks to those willing to tow, take, drive, show or
&gt; pimp the '67 Westy RFH but
&gt; I will keep it at home with me.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone have fun and travel safe. Take lots of
&gt; photos and post them asap for
&gt; the rest of us to enjoy.
&gt; 
&gt; The '67 Westy remains for sale. Pmail me for details
&gt; and pricing if interested.
