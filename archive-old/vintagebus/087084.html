Subject: Re: [T2] GPS Devices

If you have a Lap Top....Microsoft has a very nice program called Streets &amp; Trips that comes with a GPS device and the disk for about $100.00
It's especially nice because the display is &quot;Lap Top&quot; size.
I have used it and I like it.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone using a GPS device in there Bus that will give miles per hour also?
&gt; I'm not familiar with these, other than a brief experience in the AF.  I
&gt; didn't know you could get watches with GPS until Ronnie was telling me about
&gt; them.
