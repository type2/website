Back in the late sixties I used to ride with a 'gimp' (his choice of
description for him being shy a leg) who had built a VW powered Norton
Atlas.  Not only 'went' but handled too.  Last I saw him, hewas trying
to shoehorn a Corvair motor into it. Most inpressive bike I'd ever
seen until the Ferarri powered V-Max pulled up next to me at a
stoplight a few years later.

There's a bunch of exotic two-wheelers out there!

Jim
