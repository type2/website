Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Westfalia in Hot VW's

I really like seeing nice stock  restorations in the mags.  I actually bought 
the April 02 Hot VWs cause it had Matthew Henricks' 21 window in it.   Sweet 
bus. Looking forward to seeing your 59 Westy.

 for a perfect resoration and I, finally have a reason
 to buy a HotVws that has at least one VW in it that I
 would want to look at!

 &gt; Sheesh, it feels like I haven't posted a message in
 &gt; years.  How the hell is everyone??!!  I've been
 &gt; caught up mostly with life itself, and very little
 &gt; in buses.  That better change soon.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Just got a call this morning from R.K. Smith at Hot
 &gt; VW's.  He came up in January to shoot my '59 Westy,
 &gt; and told me this morning that it will be in the June
 &gt; 2002 issue.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Unfortunately it's just a plain ole, run-o-the-mill
 &gt; stock restoration, nothing fancy like the &quot;slammin
 &gt; jammin $30k barndoor deluxe panel
 &gt; what-cha-ma-call-it&quot;, so it might go totally
 &gt; unnoticed by the VW crowd.  I thought I would give
 &gt; everyone who is interested a heads up to be on the
 &gt; lookout for it.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I knew I should have put bags under it.
