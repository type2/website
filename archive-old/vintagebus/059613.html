Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

&gt;I have had this problem when I put a doghouse shroud on single port heads.

that could be the other 'bingo' moment - that is the setup i have, too.

shoot, i got a tap and die set somewhere... next time the motor is out,
maybe i'll just make a rod that fits the shroud/head weirdness and thread
the end for the thermostat.
