Happy Friday.

A funny and piognant thing happened to me on the drive
down to OCTO last Sunday.

Since it was the first time I took DARTHVW on the
freeway, I was taking it easy, going about 50-55 in
the right lane down the infamous 405.

I kept checking the rear-view for angry yuppies
(although at 6:30 am they're not even at Starbuck's
yet). Then I suddenly noticed a taxi driving behind me
(for those of you who don't live in L.A. there are no
taxis driving around waiting for fares. You have to
call them for a pick-up and a ride.) Anyway, here's
this driver with an empty taxi following me, going 50
mph for several miles.

Then I got to thinking: &quot;Is he waiting for me to break
down?&quot; Like he knows I'm a potential fare? Tailing me
the way vultures circle above an injured wildebeast on
the Serengetti?

Brutal.

Finally he pulled off, but the whole time I was
thinking like &quot;oh, you're not getting me, bastard!
Today is NOT my day.&quot; Like he was the freakin' grim
reaper or something.

The kicker was, and I'm not kidding, there was another
one following me for about 4 miles on the way back
home!
Jeez. Does my bus look that bad?

So, if you find yourself being tailed by a taxi, or a
tow truck for that matter, wave the guy around and
say, &quot;not today buddie&quot;
