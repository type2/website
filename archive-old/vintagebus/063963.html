Subject: CW crank and flywheel

I'm still working on rebuilding my engine in my bus. I'm putting it back to stock 1600 DP except for
the crank. I'm going with a CW crank and I guess I'm going with the SCAT CW new cast crank (good
price, seems adequate for a stock rebuild).

My question however, concerns the flywheel. The SCAT crank is 8 dowel and there is nothing wrong
with my stock flywheel. Should (or can) I just remove 4 dowels from the new crank? If not, should I
get a new FW or get the old one machined?
