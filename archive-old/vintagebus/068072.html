&gt; Grease? In the link pins? It looked like arizona dirt was used instead! I 
&gt; adjusted and greased them a few times too, but  wondered why it never made

Hi Sean,
Good to hear you have things back together.  Just remember to pump grease in 
each zerk fitting till new grease flows out from all the front suspension 
every 3,000 miles to prevent that from happening again!
