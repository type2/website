Hi Al,
Plus you will have to get rid of the lightened FW for a stock wieght one.  
Lightened is good for shaving off hunderths of a second when drag racing, but 
produces a lousy idle.  Overall it sounds like this engine was built for high 
RPMing not the RPMs the bus needs to get around.  This will be further 
compounded if the heads have oversized valves!  Unless you know the builder 
and the former owner enough to trust your life to, otherwise it sounds like a 
bad idea.
  A few years ago some friends of ours headed out from up here in Washington 
State for the Classic with a weakly rebuilt engine.  They got as far as 
cental Oregon before blowing the engine.  Fortunitly near a VW shop we know!  
This shop had a low milage used 1600 engine that was traded in when a Thing 
owner soon realized he needed a 2 liter engine instead.  So our friends 
bought this engine and we happened to be going to a VW show in the area so we 
helped them install it.
   Lower pulley was one of those really small power pulley AKA Kiss of death. 
 The distributor clamp was an after market piece of juck that only touched 
the distributor in three small spots instead of most of the circumferance.  
Resulting in a distributor that easily turned even with the clamp tightened.  
So we helped them replace the lower pulley and fix (File) the distributor 
clamp.
  This 1600 engine ran, but never ran well and required the timing to be 
reset too often.  Upon dissassembling it turned out the rebuilder, mechanic 
or the Thing owner had tried at one point or another to install the 
distributor drive shaft.  The mistake made in doing this was that the one 
shim that should go under the distributor drive shaft was offset for center 
from it's proper place blocking the distributor drive shaft from seating down 
into the engine case.  So instead of removing the distributor drive shaft and 
moving the shim back into place, a hammer or other large heavy object was 
used to pound it into place.  Resulting in the distributor shim being sheared 
and part of it bent down into the bore in the case, which in turn cracked the 
bore the bottom of the distributor drive went through!  With all this 
pounding going on and the shim causing the distributor drive shaft to be 
installed in a press fit situation instead of slip in the brass gear on the 
crankshaft was chewed up dueing this process!  Allowing the timing to jump a 
tooth here and there.  
  Fun, fun, fun!
