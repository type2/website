Subject: Re: [VB] Big Dents A Better Mouse Trap (DC)

Sounds like this is not any easier, just less use of the arm muscles. And,
of course, not every one has a power ram.

I hammered out the ribs first since these are the areas that were subject to
the most damage from the stuff being tossed in the bed. Hammering on the
ribs pulled the flat areas up at the same time. I only had to hit the flat
areas on the parts of the bed that were seriously bowed.

How do you get to the areas over the wheel wells and over the beams running
lengthwise under the bed with your power ram?

&gt;  I use my power ram and a piece of 4 X 4 lumber to push the dent up
&gt; from underneath, I also have a piece of scrape lumber under the ram to
spread
&gt; the load.  You can do the same with scrape wood and a bottle jack.  Start
&gt; pushing on the outside of the dent, using your body hammer to stress
relieve
&gt; the metal outside the dent.  You'll have to move your jack around the dent
&gt; several times and you may not get the dent out all at once.  But with the
&gt; jack supplying the muscle, you won't get worn out.  I myself use a 6 ft
&gt; straight edge to check the progress.  Once the big stuff is done you can
move
&gt; onto the ribs, I have a piece of scrape iron that I ground down to fit the
&gt; SC-DC ribs.  This screws to my 4 X 4 on the end of my ram.  I go at the
ribs
&gt; the same way.  Working from the outside of the dent to the center.  Any
other
&gt; small dents can be filled with body filler, or if you happen to have a
stud
&gt; gun, you can metal finish up the rest of it.
&gt;
&gt; Why work harder than you have too???
