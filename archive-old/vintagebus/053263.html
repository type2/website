&gt; I don't know, I like the idea that if I put $5000
&gt; into a Bus, I might get
&gt; a reasonable portion of that if it's stolen, not
&gt; $100.

&gt; &gt;I dont know about you, but I wish all my buses were
&gt; worth about $100 each...even
&gt; though I have waaaay more than that in 'em.  It
&gt; would be so great if they
&gt; were worthless.
