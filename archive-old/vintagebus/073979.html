&gt; It's a Blaupunkt 3 band that came out of my 61 Rustfalia...looking for any

&gt; never put it to power so I don't know if it works) and maybe model name or 
&gt; possible age?

Hi Brian,
Well from the images it is an AM, FM, and either SW or LW band radio.  We can 
not quite read the numbers on the upper/last band.  It was sold in the late 
1950s and early 1960s.  The paper label for which model would have been on the 
rear of one of the sides.  It will have a way to switch it to either 12 or 6 
volt, and between negative and positive ground vehicles.  To find these 
switches carefully pry off the top and bottom lids of the main radio body.  Clean out 
the insides and check the switche markings.  Some of these look like round 
plugs that you remove and replug in at a differant twisted angle than before or 
they are shaped like a popsicle stick that has to be removed and flipped over 
and replaced back in for the switch in voltage or grounding.  One at a time 
remove the vaccum tubes and replace them back.  Do the same with any other 
connections on the radio that are in place.  This will help clean any corrosion in 
these connections.  After closing back up the radio, connect antennia, 
positive and negative, and the speaker to see if the radio works!
  We have had seen where one of these early radios will work in only one or 
two bands and after a couple of month of driving the other band/s will suddenly 
work after being driven around.  Best guess is the road vibration helps clean 
up some corrorsion over time.
