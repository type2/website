Hello List,
Yesterday I decided to check the valves on a stock 1600 that has been 
running fine.  They were last checked when I put the engine in about 4 
months ago.  All four valves on the driver's side were too tight. No 
clearance at all. The other side was fine. Any ideas what caused  this?  
They adjusted back to specs fine but I don't want to overlook some other 
potential problem.
