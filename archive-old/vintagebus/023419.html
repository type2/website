Hi Brad,

I'm assuming you are all VDO gauges?

Oil temp:  If you go with the dipstick sender on the oil temp, it is easy to
get working.  You didn't mention what sender you are using for oil temp,
there are at least 4 places to mount them :)  Easy gauge, just one wire to
engine.

Oil Pressure:  I'm mounting mine as we speak!  This is easy too, just a
single wire to the engine, the rest comes from front (power and gauge
light).  You have two choices of senders... one with &quot;dual&quot; that does the
existing Idiot light, one that is &quot;single&quot; that won't allow the Idiot light.
The cost isn't that much more for the &quot;dual&quot;, but I'm told by some that the
dual may be slower to reflect Oil Pressure changes... not sure if this is
true, just passing on what others have said.  I went for the dual...

Can't help with gas gauge, I have the same problem...

Gauges are easy.  Just run you wires properly to the back.

Hope this answers some of your questions...

Ok. Figured out that I have seized bearing on #3. Am planning on a complete
bottom end rebuild, so I'm prepared for the worst, and whatever happens
won't be as bad if i was more of an optimist. Anyhow, while I'm in the empty
engine room, and the engine is out, I want to take this time to add some
things. What gauges should definitely be added? I have an oil temp gauge but
something tells me it doesn't work, as I have never saw it move. I read in
the archive (my browser is sending me invalid page faults or I'd be there
now) to add an oil pressure gauge as well, but what else? And how hard are
these to hook up for your average up and coming bus doctor? Also, my gas
gauge doesnt work. Is there a procedure to run, and see if it is either my
sender or the gauge itself? Thanks for any help, and I really hope to be on
the road soon.
