&gt; But I have noticed that different
&gt; VW starters  are different lengths and I may have a shorter one in there.
&gt;  You may want to think about getting a shorter one when you next need a
&gt; starter, if that is the differnce.

That's a good point. Alhough I had the starter out during the cleanup I
neglected to note the numbers. All I know is that its a  6volt pushing 12.
