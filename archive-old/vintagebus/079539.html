Subject: Re: [VB] RE: car fire

Its illegal to make new halon. Is is not illegal to have and use halon 
already made
before. Its is still available from companies that buy and recycle it. It is
expensive. Like the old freon used in auto air conditioners. 
 www.h3r_dot_com is the company that I used.
