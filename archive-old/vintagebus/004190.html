&gt;
&gt; But now I find myself nervous and uncomfertable driving. I keep waiting
for
&gt; something to happen again. Having a wheel come off was pretty
intense...and
&gt; I can't seem to shake it.
&gt;
&gt; Is this gonna go away? I feel good about my work, but I'm just nervous for
&gt; some reason. Anybody else ever have this?
&gt;

Dear Sleepless in San Angelo:

I don't think that what you are feeling is unusual at all.

I recommend that you spend as much time behind the wheel of your bus between
now and your long trip on May 6 as you can. Driving your bus successfully on
many short trips will re-acclimate you to being in the bus without incident.
Completing many short drives over different terrain and in different
situations will help re-build the confidence that was shaken in your earlier
incident.

I've had similar fears regarding mechanical breakdown and I've found that
the only way to minimize these feelings is to &quot;get back in the saddle&quot; as
they say.
Remember to run through a pre-trip checklist to ensure the mechanical
soundness of your bus before you head out to Ennis, this will reassure you
that things are mechanically as they should be.

Good Luck
John :-)
