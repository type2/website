Hi All,

Well, I got my birth certificate from VWoA (and actully, they now want more
$$ than what is listed on the web when I looked a month ago... I think they
want $15 now)... quite the cool piece of paper.

Anyway, my bus was deliver to Portland OR (as per the Mcode plate) but I
would love to find out which dealer it was sold by so I can find a correct
dealer license frame.  Anyone know how to do this?  Do the dealerships keep
those types of records back to 59?  or would it be best to try and trace it
back through previous owners?

Dave
