Subject: Re: [VB] bad brakes


From: &quot;C.R. Sauls&quot;
&gt; First guess, brake fluid or grease on the brake shoes on the RIGHT side.
&gt;

No....brakes 'pull' to the side that works.  If the friction material does not
grab anything, it cannot slow it down. If the RIGHT side is contaminated, it
would pull left.

&gt; I had tie rods replaced at a local shop and haven't really driven my bus
&gt; much since.  Then today I applied the brakes and my bus really pulled to the
&gt; right.
&gt;
&gt; I don't really have time to look at it until next weekend when I'm planning
&gt; a tune up and oil change - but does anyone have any ideas as to why my bus
&gt; would pull to one side like that. I guess a brake adjustment is the first
&gt; thing to try but I thought I'd ask.
