&gt; Steve and anyone else who may have had this problem....did your

&gt; My accelerator
&gt; has had a &quot;catch&quot; when first applying pressure to the pedal. It seems to
&gt; release OK
&gt; and has never stuck with the throttle open, but it's annoying.


Yup,

I just solved that one on my 67 recently. After a whole lot of
experimenting and wondering, it became apparent that the throttle plate
was closing all the way and binding in the throat.  This seems to be
designed in, at least on the brasilian 34PICT. The solution became
extremely simple when I finally noticed this:  Just turn the idle
adjustment screw at the top of the accel lever (the screw that rides the
stairs) in a bit til the throttle just never closes all the way. The
engine now appears to be running normally, and the pedal no longer sticks
at the beginning of travel. 

cal

67 deluxe, no longer sticking
64 kombi, still running daily, no problems for 26 months straight.
