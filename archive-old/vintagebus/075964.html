Subject: Vintage tent trailer FS

Thought I'd save this for Friday.. and offer this up for grabs to listees 
before putting it out on thesamba_dot_com.

I've got a 1967 Heilite Viking tent trailer for sale. 2-wheel trailer...so 
you'll need a hitch.
Tows awesome.....and opens up to a huge space......plenty of room for 4 
adults to sleep.

I havent had it very long....but something else has been found and we need to 
make room.

It's in good shape for a 36 year old trailer.  It is in very usable condition 
as is.....but it ain't no show winner.  Some of you may have seen it at the 
VTO campout (Fri) over the Classic weekend.

I have a lot a og paperwork that comes with it....along with CA trailer 
plates that say ' Heilite'

P-mail me if interested (pics).....located in SoCal.
