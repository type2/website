&gt; Well, that was 1991, and the bus charged just fine for about a year until I sold it.

&gt; I don't see how the worn out brushes would damage the generator.   They
are just little square of coarbon AFAICT, and when worn down they just
don't push against the commutator.   I wouldn't go and swap out for a
alternator instead of replacing a $7 pair of brushes.   The brushes are
tricky to install (at least the lower one) but less hassle than pulling
the gen.

&gt; Maybe you commutator was pitted when you got that engine, which wore
the brushes out.   I can see how a pitted commutator would weear out
brushes, but not the other way around.

It isn't the brushes that cause the pitting, but the arcing.  The arcing,
like welding arcs, melts bits of the commutator metal and moves them
around a bit.  You see the same thing on points, but there isn't any
sliding going on there so it is OK.

The generator I had went for 50K+ miles on the brushes it had when I
bought the bus.  After they wore out on a long trip I drove about 200
miles with the generator light on.

After that, the generator ate brushes at about 400 mile intervals.  The
commutator was ugly and couldn't be fixed by using emery paper with the
generator in place.  It would have had to be removed, disassembled, and
the commutator turned.  Given that the generator had to come out anyway, I
opted for the alternator conversion and I'm quite happy with it.
