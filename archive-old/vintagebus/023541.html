 &gt; This is better, but still questionable legally.  In most states, it's

 Illegal or not, if it keeps people from punting me off the road from behind, 
I'll
 flash people that get too close.

er- sometimes people seem to like my bus so much they are about 3 inches away 
from the rear bumper.   What tend to do is tap my brake pedal a copuple 
times- not slam the brakes, just to flash the lights at them.  It does 
actually tend to get them to back off.   I also have a working 6V horn in my 
12V bus, which alerts people quickly to the fact when they try to change 
lanes into a space occupied by my bus that it is not an empty space.  Also 
useful when someone backs out of a driveway w/o looking behind them-   the 
horn has definately averted a couple accidents.    It also helps to be alert 
when driving  - and not just in a ACVW - to avoid these hassles.   I plan to 
install back up lights in my 65 westy- it has the 67 nose cone - just for 
ease of night time backking.    (no holes will be cut)
