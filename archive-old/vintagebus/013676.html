I have a few questions about brad clasuen(the VW radio guy), I have heard a
lot of great things about him, unfortunately the last time i contacted
him(around may or june) he was no longer working on vw radios, he didn't have
the time. Does anyone know if he is working on them again, or how to get in
touch with him(i lost my contact info).

Thanks.

kevin
