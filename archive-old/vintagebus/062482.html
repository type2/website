Subject: Pop-out windows

I need to get 2 pop-out windows (glass only) ID # SEKURIT-1 D89  M89/AS2.

Does anybody have two they could sell or know where to get some? It's for my
66 standard microbus.

The story is I was trying to remove the rusted screws that connect the two
piece pop-out frames to secure the glass and I had know alternative but to
drill through the rusted screws to remove them thereafter with a screw
extractor bit. Ended up shattering the pieces. 4 out of 6 windows done
cleanly can be considered a success story.
