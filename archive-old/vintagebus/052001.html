 Not every commercial came with a black wheel. I have
 seen many Westfalia's (kombi's) that have white wheels
 from the factory. Namely my 65!
  &gt;&gt;
ya westy's got white white, like the deluxes and standards- as they were 
considered passnger cars- sort of a special kind of kombi.  Think there is 
only one white

panels, kombis, trucks got black 

Haven't seen any other colours.  though some black white do turn chocolate  
from heavy sun, esp with the coating worn off.
