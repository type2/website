We are down to 10 sets of 62-63 turquoise door panel material. If anyone has 
been putting off buying a set do it now. More will be made but it takes 3 
months to ship the material overseas, have it made than sent back to us. 


55-58 deluxe door panel material, the heat seamed center section, will be 
completed shortly.
Please let us know if you are interested, we would like to have an idea of 
how many sets to make on the first run.

In stock, 62-64 deluxe door panel material for Mouse Gray or Sealing Wax Red 
buses. As well as, the correct material for the seats. Going fast order 
today. 

Look for Scotty Knox's 64 21 window at BBTB, sure looks good with an 
Upholstery Haus interior, door panel material, seat material, headliner and 
sunroof cover.
