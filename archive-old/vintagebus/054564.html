Subject: RE: [VB] Some power plant questions...(long)

&gt;Again, overall so far I'm quite happy with the engine as is. I'm just
debating whether a little more refining might be worth the effort. &lt;

Never leave well enough alone ;)

I think you might be referring to me with all the engine changes back and
forth over the last 6 months...  Pitiful really, but just seeing the
differences is worth the extra effort to me.  I am surprised no one has
commented on this topic yet because it seems for bus people the best
performance solutions are headers and small aftermarket dual carbs.  Most
bus people that I see run a header system of some sort and 009 or Kadrons.

According the Jake Raby he thinks the 36 Dell'orto carbs are a better design
than the 34 Webers for power.  I have never goofed with the baby Dell's, so
I will take Jake's word for it, also I am not certain they have a vacuum
port for the dizzy.  I have mixed emotions about the Kadrons and would not
personally run them, also I do not think they have a vacuum port for the
dizzy.

The Webers I have seen running vacuum dizzys usually just use one side for
vacuum instead of combining both sides for maximum suction.  Usually just
take the drivers side carb and use the cloth braided line to hook it up to
the dizzy. I would definitely check the advance curve after doing this to
ensure the dizzy is advancing smoothly and fully.

I run pure vacuum on my bus and others I maintain (long &quot;I am a sucker&quot;
story).  I like them anyway and have had good luck so far.  In a loaded
Westi I would never try to run a 009 again, just too much weight.  

As far as carbs go I like the 30PICT series (want to try a 28PICT one day
though out of morbid curiosity).  I have not had good luck with the 34PICT
carbs so I gave them away (think you must use the correct matching dizzy
with two vacuum ports for them to work right).  Right now I have a DP engine
and mount the smaller carbs on an adaptor plate...  The adaptor plates suck
and will need grinding to fit the linkage properly.

The exhaust is pretty cut and dry from my experiences.  If you run a center
mount carb that needs heat risers you must stick with the stock bus exhaust
for it to work right.  If you run dual carbs definitely go with a header
system.  The stock exhaust flows very poorly and there is a dramatic
difference over a header system.

Many people swear by the single ports for longevity of the heads (no
cracking).  Some claim more torque at low RPM, I have no data on this either
way.  On the down side Bill Fisher in his &quot;how to hotrod VW engines&quot; claims
10 HP from the DP heads alone, which is good enough for me to stay DP.  The
intake manifolds do exist for the Webers on the SPs, but are rare to come by
from what I have seen.

Right now I run slow and steady :)  Get 23 MPG on the highway and max cruise
at about 63 MPH with 205/75R14s.  Remember this is fully loaded to the gills
with family, beer, roof rack, water, food, extra parts, and misc. camping
gear.  I think slow is an understatement really :)  Also I jetted the carb a
little rich, 135 main, so I would not cruise lean, if you are more
conservative I bet 25+ MPG is possible.  I like what I am running now, but
you have to get used to it.

The perfect bus engine is almost stock in my opinion with only a few notable
upgrades.
-  Small dual carbs or 30PICT-3
-  DP
-  Vacuum dizzy
-  Solid rocker shafts (replaces the jinky clips)
-  Stock valve adjusters (have had others break)
-  Counterweighted crank
-  Berg pick of the litter stock cam
-  Berg Equalizer rear pulley
-  Stock exhaust (it fits and works - a lot can be said for that over max
performance)
-  Tiger 581 CDI (you need one or a Pertronix)
-  Copper tip Bosch or NGK plugs (not anything platinum tipped)
-  Stock valve springs for a bus (too much seat pressure on the high rev
ones - you will not see 5000RPM anyway)  
-  SS valves and sodium filled exhaust if you can get them (I could not find
them)
-  Doghouse cooler
-  Full flow oil filter (The CB Performance Maxi 3 oil pump works great - no
leaks)

...  That is about all I can think of.  A little out of scope from the
original question, but may help explain my thought process on what defines a
good bus engine.  My goal is long term reliability and longevity because on
camping trips breaking down is not an option.

My future plans are for a 1700 or 1800 Type4 engine conversion.  If you have
seen the strength of components that are in a Type4 you will understand.  I
predict this motor will last 150,000 miles in a Split and will give an
honest 65-75 HP which will be enough for loaded situations and maybe a
trailer in the future.  Weber 34ICT carbs and basically the rest stock.
Looking at the Oregon Performance DTM kit.

Hope this helps someone...
