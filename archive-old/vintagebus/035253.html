 1. was the speaker on the bus installed regardless of whether a radio was
 ordered (i know radios were usually installed by the dealer)
 =======
cheap vw installing a free speaker bracket and speaker?   surely you jest!!!!

++++++++++++++
 2. which leads to question 2- if a speaker was installed independednt of the
 radio was small phillips screw inserted roughly 2&quot; to the right of the ash
 tray to keep the speaker housing from falling backwards? i have a 1967 
factory
 manual that shows a bus w/ this screw but dunno if this is correct for a 65'
 (can you tell i don't like drilling holes??)
=========
I installed the speaker in the seaker bracket and put it in my 65.  there are 
two phillips screws in the holes you see froms worms eye view under the edge 
of the dash under the speaker grill area.  No need to drill holes.  Youdo 
want a speaker bracket ans a sepaker that fits it.
 ++++++++
 3. which leads to question 3 is the metal speaker bracket different on a 1967
 bus than a 1965?? 

I believe it is the same
