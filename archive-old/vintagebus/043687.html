&gt;as for the vw copyright thing - something i havent seen mentioned - if vw
&gt;own the copyright which they still probably do -they have to fight for any
&gt;loss - what loss can be proved. gain maybe :)

If they want money then yes, I think they would have to go to court for
it.  But even without the money, VW can say &quot;cease and desist&quot; and I'm
fairly sure we would be legally obligated to comply.

&gt;i've got a few bits and pieces - 1 is the 55 workshop manual - pages are
&gt;all real tidy if you ever want to scan it.

Right now the doc project isn't looking to scan the workshop manuals -
the later ones are already reprinted and we are working on Bentley to
reprint the earlier ones.  Kind of bad form to ask them to reprint it
and then make scans available for free.  :)  See the &quot;about&quot; page at
http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/aboutdoc.htm for a little more info.  If
you want to scan it on your own that's between you, whoever you give
the scans to, and VW.

Basically, VW could slap us for reproducing anything with their
copyright on it.  With that in mind, we are trying to present
documents that are 1) most likely to be useful to the VW hobbyist and
2) least likely to draw VW's wrath upon us.  If we were scanning
New Beetle service manuals or even the Bentley reprints of the
Bus manuals, we'd have lawyer letters in our mailboxes tomorrow.
So we tend to go for documents that VW or others are not reprinting 
and not likely to reprint at this time.

Within those guidelines, we'd be happy to scan anything else you'd
care to lend us!  Pmail dude_at_failsure_dot_net for more info.  Thanks!
