Hi Phil,
The problem is that there is really no way for sure to know what gearing you 
have after all this time and DPOs unless you grew up with your bus and/or 
have ALL the repair receipts.  Our 1960 walk thru panel came with a tranny 
that topped out at 35MPH _at_ 3,000 in fourth gear.  Which we only could tell 
that it was a problem not by sound, but by the fact we could not get it over 
45 MPH floored with a newly rebuilt big bore 40HP engine!  Finding that out 
we tached our 1963 SC and found it ran 3,800 RPM at 55 MPH in fourth instead 
of the 3,000 RPM we thought it sounded like.  Which explained the low MPG, 
and high engine temps which caused low enough oil pressure to flicker on the 
idiot light at idle after a long hill during the summer months.  In other 
words put your bus together and beg, borrow, or buy a tach for at least a 
fifteen minute drive to see where 1,500 and 3,000 RPM are at which MPH in all 
forward gears.  Only then you can make an informed decision about your bus 
and wether you can drive it as is.  Especially in traffic that can be moving 
up and over 90 MPH here in the USA!   Eric&amp;Barb
