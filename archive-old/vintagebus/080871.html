Subject: Re: [T2] Poweder coating parts a home??

Dave,

I have one and have used it for several years.

Powder coating Works great!  The only problem I see for you is that I 
doubt that a toaster oven would provide the necessary heat.

Generally 350-400 degrees for 20 minutes after powder flow.

The other part is that unless you have a way to &quot;hang&quot; the parts in the 
oven after powder coating(this is often tricky), you will have flaws in it 
where you set it on something.

Do *NOT* use your regular oven for this.

I bought a used electric oven for less than $100...powder coated almost 
everything(even the heater boxes) on my t4 engine except the front cross 
tin...just too big.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Anyone tried the home powder coating system like Eastwood and Harbour Freight

snipped

&gt; have it done and it would be cheaper to buy one of these since most of the
&gt; parts fit in a toaster oven.
