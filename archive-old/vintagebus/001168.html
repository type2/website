was writ:
&gt;&gt;I have a spare cover plate for my overhead fresh air box, and I was
thinking about putting some gauges up there (oil pressure, temp, maybe a
clock from a KG). Has anyone done this before? Is there enough room for
the flap to work properly? How hard is it to get wiring up there? Are
there any compelling reasons NOT to do this


I'm also trying to figure out where to put a tach and oil pressure in by
double cab.  There was a setup on ebay with lots of gauges and lights on it
mounted in the fresh air box...  Also, there was a real nice white single
cab a while back in HotVWs or VWTrends that had some gauges mounted above
the drivers front window that looked nice.  I'm trying to see my gauges
would mount better on the parcel try.  hmmmmm.  decisions decisions...

later
