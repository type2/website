I believe the game you are referring to is Beetle Crazy Cup.  Lots of fun.
I have seen them at Target and Wal-Mart.

Subject: [T2] PC bus game


&gt; When in K-mart about 2 months ago, I saw a PC racing game that featured VW
&gt; busses as the vehicle of choice. I was poor that day so did not buy it.
Now
&gt; I want one. Anybody know where to get one? I have been back to the store
&gt; several times to no avail. I have tried searches on some game sites and
come
&gt; up empty.
