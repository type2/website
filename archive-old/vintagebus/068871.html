Yeah, I've been thinking along the same lines.  Makes sense.  Now I have to figure out how to get all of the bearings out...

Seems like I saw a website recently where someone had documented their tranny replacement with photos (ie, not the one in the type2_dot_com library).  
Now I can't find it -- anyone know what I'm talking about?

Thanks,
Joe
