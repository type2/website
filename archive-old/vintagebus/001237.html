Subject: Re: [VB] painting steering wheel?

When you send a steering wheel out to be restored, most places end up
painting them.  The difference is that they use an epoxy paint.  Very tough,
and chip resistant.  What you need to do is go down to Wally world
(wal-mart) and buy the appliance paint. It comes in black, white, and
almond.  It says on the can that it is an epoxy paint.  I have had very good
results, I have a wheel that I did about 5 years ago, and it has very little
wear through, and only a couple of chips, and it has been through 5 people,
and all of them used it as a daily driver.
