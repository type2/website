&gt;the inertia from the accident caused the bus to turn 90 degrees and flip
over-LANDING ON TOP OF ME. i was pinned/trapped under the bus until the
crowd of people around realized i was under it and lifted it off of me.
&gt;
What part of you was pinned?  Your legs or were you entirely underneath
the side of the Bus?
