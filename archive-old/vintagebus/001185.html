Here are a couple of messages I saved from June of 1999.  The first one is
from  fig_at_wmail.misanet_dot_org (Christian Figenschou)

That they are ugly or worse is beyond dispute,

BUT

I see two points I see in their favour:

1) Volkswagen approved of them -- I have a factory service bulletin with
plans for their construction from sheetmetal.

2) In an unscientific test I conducted, the same engine runs hotter
(dipstick test) in my panelvan without scoops, than it does in my 63
Dormobile, which had scoops fitted when I bought it.

The scoops on the Dormer are to a pattern that looks very close to the VW
plans I have. When I first bought the Dormer I believed the scoops would
restrict airflow and, since I thought they were ugly as well, I planned to
remove them. But the engine test persuaded me otherwise.

FWIW

The second email is from Gary Gibson:

All,
I like George's theory on how air scoops might actually restrict air to
the engine!  I've had a pair on my '67 for 15 years and I feel that they
actually improve cooling and performance.  Twice during desert back road
adventures the scoops  have gotten knocked off the sides of the bus by
trees along the narrow trail.  I found that the bus ran hotter and the
fuel economy went down on the hyway sans scoops.  I also find that when
running the bus into strong head winds, something that can make your bus
run extremely hot, that the engine runs almost too cool with scoops.  I
agree with Bob Hoover that the scoops do collect alot of crud and
probably force more dirt into the engine compartment.  Though, after
recently tearing down a &quot;scooped&quot; engine, I found that the cooling
surfaces were clean.
I would not put scoops on our pretty '66 Kiwi Bus.  They are not
pretty.  I'll keep them on the '67 beater.  They are the cheap molded
plastic ones which I fiberglassed in order to give them some useful
strength!   Gary Gibson  Tucson, Arizona

I must add too that I remember someone mentioning a &quot;Half Scoop&quot; seemed to
be a happy medium.  It had good effects at both town and highway speeds.
