Pat, I've done this to all my buses. I haven't installed the shoulder harnesses, but some have. If you'll check the archives (as noted in the &quot;Friday Links&quot; post ...or whatever the name was), you'll find the URL for the archives and you can then find some instructions on installing shoulder harnesses.

If you're just looking to install lap belts, most years of belts will fit fine and some newer aftermarket belts will as well. Remember to use a BIG washer or to weld on a plate or something beneath to distribute the stress in case of an actual accident. You don't want your belt giving way under pressure.

BTW, all buses I've seen (back to '64 at least) up close have anchors in the front for seat belts. As early as '67, they had anchors in the back too. These are sometimes plugged with large, plastic, phillips-headed screws.

Good luck! Joe
