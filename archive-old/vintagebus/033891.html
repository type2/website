I have to agree!  I sold some Datsun Z stuff I had and unbeknown to me one of
the parts was un usable.  When the buyer received the part and then contacted
me, I had him send it back and I apologized and promptly returned the money
including the shipping back to me!  This is no heroic deed....it is an ethical
deed!   Do unto others .....Karma....what every you want to call it.  Do what
is right....we all know what that is!!
