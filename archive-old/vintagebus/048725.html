Subject: '59 Kombi 1600cc engine rebuild

After hitting a few snags (lost a few little parts, didn't have 
another I needed) I started putting my 1600cc DP engine back 
together. I had to replace the cam, crank, lifters, and bearings. I 
also bought a new piston/cylinder set from Ronnie. I had my case line 
bored as well. The machinist told me he really liked my case. He said 
it was a nice low mileage case. He felt like with the repairs I'm 
doing to the engine (not a full fledged rebuild) that I should be 
able to get a good 50,000 miles out of it in a bus (more in a bug he 
said). That's perfect for me. My costs/mileage ratio is right on 
target.

This is the first engine I've torn down and put back together. Right 
now i've got the case back together and the flywheel is on. I want to 
set the end play, but I need to make me one of those bars to hold the 
flywheel while I tighten the gland nut. I figured I'd get started on 
that in the morning. I hope to have the motor basically assembled by 
the end of the day tommarrow. I want to try and spray some paint in 
my engine compartment and paint the engine tin before I re-install 
the motor, so I don't know if I'll get a round to firing it up before 
the weekend is out. But early this coming week I'm gonna stick it in 
and go for the break-in.

I can't express how good it feels to do take apart and put back 
together an engine. It really helps to take the &quot;mystery&quot; away from 
how things work. Makes me feel a lot more confertable about my VW's 
for sure. Even if this motor repair bites the dust, I feel like I've 
learned much more than the $$$ I've spent. And I can always take it 
apart and try again. But I have a lot of confidence at the 
moment!!!!! My wife is having to deal with it ALL right now too. I&quot;M 
THE MAN!!!!
