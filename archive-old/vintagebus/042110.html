&gt; &gt;Hi all;
&gt; &gt;The attached Letter to the Editor was published in my local paper this
&gt; &gt;morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to write back. I can think of
&gt; &gt;dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I would share his letter
&gt; &gt;with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to destroy this guy's
&gt; &gt;nonsense.
&gt; 
&gt; He should read the article in Discover about suvs. They kill people. Mostly 
&gt; others, but the also tip over. Buses keep most of thier weight neer the 
&gt; ground and dont ride up on other cars when they hit them.

I think that you should take another look at the physics here.  Buses do
tend to be pretty tippy, probably moreso than most modern SUVs.  The auto
manufacturers don't want to get savaged by Consumer Reports as Suzuki was,
so they have made their SUVs wider and lower than the older &quot;serious&quot; off
roaders.  Buses are very narrow with respect to their height and the
wonderful ground clearance of a bus does little to lower the CG.  If
Consumer Reports had tested the VW bus then Suzuki would have been off the
hook.

I think that the reason that a lot of folk have gone to SUVs is identical
to the reason that many of us love our buses.  They wanted a car that
would carry a lot of stuff and that wasn't bothered by the occasional
rough road.  Of course, people get carried away with everything, so some
SUVs are becoming pleasure barges rather than utility vehicles.  I've seen
quite a few buses that fall into that catagory as well.

All vehicles are quite safe if driven within their limits.  Don't mistake
lack of education on the part of the drivers for a defect in the vehicles.
The safest vehicle can be dangerous if driven by an idiot!

&gt; Its also interesting to note that an suv wastes time. See article to find 
&gt; out why.

I did.  Imagine if they had taken data for buses! :)

I find it rather humorous that the basic thrust of their article was that
SUVs are driven too fast, then they turn around and say that they impede
traffic because they don't accelerate from lights as quickly as other
cars.

I guess that we should all be driving Ferraris that are governed to a
maximum speed of 50 MPH. :)
