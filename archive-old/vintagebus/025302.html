Subject: Re: Which Vacuum Dizzy?
Message-ID: &lt;37410CEA.E40FF640_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

List,

About a week ago I asked the question which vacuum dizzy to use on my
1600 DP, 34 PICT-3 carb stocker engine to replace the 009 dizzy. Well
the replies came in and were interesting. Lots of good advice and info
was shared. Thanks to those folks that wrote!

Out of twelve replies (some quite long and detailed), it was a 50/50
spit decision on whether to use a single or dual vacuum unit. So, armed
with all this new found knowledge, I hit the swap meet last weekend at
the Volkswagens on the Green show here in Denver. By the time it was
over, I had good clean versions of both types. The dual vacuum even had
a new cap, points, rotor and condenser. Total cost - $15 for both. And
as a bonus, I even managed to find a nice windshield washer bottle and
cap.

Well, tonight the 009 came out and the dual vacuum dizzy went in. What a
difference! Nice and smooth with no more flat spot. While I'm no techno
genius on the why's and how's on the advance curve of this distributor,
my highly unscientific seat of the pants testing tells me this was the
right thing to do.

Once again, Thanks to the list for the help!
