I hate to see everyone ripping these guys to shreds about their
barndoor....when I heard them telling how it came to be topless, it sounded
like they had legitimately tried to restore the thing, and it was so rusty
that it basically collapsed when they tried to start work on the top.  My view
is AT LEAST IT'S ON THE ROAD.  And, to top it off, it's being driven by two
guys with great senses of humor (anyone happen to see the 'for sale' sign on
the back of the bus at the Classic?) who were selling their parts amazingly
cheap.  I found some stuff I needed for my bus in better shape and cheaper
than everyone else I saw there.  So give 'em a break.  At least they drive it
and don't get all bent out of shape about the fact that most people think they
are the spawns of Satan.  

Thanks for letting me rant
