Chris Cybulski and John Stainkamp from Greensboro, NC
showed up at my doorstep today in Chris' new 67 transporter.
What a sweet machine! John brought his two children, Daniel
and Emily, so they had a busful.

We immediately compared engines, and it is a toss up as to
who will first get to experience the glowing warmth of a
gasoline-magnesium inferno. I was a strong contender with
the perpetual film of gas coating my fuel pump. Chris was not
to be outdone with his clear fuel filter letting in air bubbles
at a relentless but hypnotic pace. We could not figure out
how this was happening, but decided to brute force the
problem by lovingly slapping on a hose clamp. Thus Chris'
life expectancy was slightly increased. We each placed our
right hands upon the Muir book and vowed to cure the
problems immediately. Well, not really, but it makes a fair story.

The tour box was fun. It contained several practical items, such as
a flashlight, a prepaid calling card, and a digital pressure gauge.
There
were also numerous kewl stickers, maps, trinkets, pictures, and
assorted VW memorabilia that my wife finds endlessly boring.
Which is to say the stuff was fascinating.

Chris also brought me a bottle of homemade wine sent by Marv Krupp.
Thank you Marv! I am torn between drinking it and saving it in my wine
collection forever. Perhaps I will take it to the upcoming FrozenBus
campout and share the wealth. A toast to the List. Yes indeed!

My non-VW oriented wife took the kids outside to share in her
passion: horses. She took one out of the paddock and put on a
halter and saddle pad. John's kids were then given a tour of the
front yard from a viewpoint 17 hands in the air. I think they liked it.

Our scheduled rendezvous with Dallas Smith was quickly approaching,
so we packed up the tourbox. I added a horseshoe that my kids painted
the night before - an amulet of good fortune, if you will. Then we sped
off at 40 mph to the previously agreed upon barbeque* joint.

Everyone had barbeque except Emily, who had a delicious looking
cheeseburger. As Chris pointed out, this was not your typical
hippie/vegitarian fare. But by damn it was good! The list of homemade
desserts was nearly as long as the menu itself, and we indulged in
a piece of key lime pie, a mean looking Klondike pie, and several
scoops of honest-to-goodness-homemade-vanilla-icecream just
like my dad used to make every Fourth of July. Well, nearly like
it anyway.

After lunch we went outside for a quick picture of the handoff, which
was followed by everyone sniffing the rearends of everyone else's
bus. Once we were satisfied with the anatomical correctness of each
bus, we said our goodbyes and parted ways.

Dallas will escort the baton to Raleigh, NC. From there is will head
down
to Charleston SC, Florida, and then to a town near you. In case the tour

administrator cannot keep up, check out the list of participants
(http://www.excalibre_dot_com/bussin/drivers_dates.html) and set up
the schedule yourself. Let's &quot;keep the mother rolling... One more
time.&quot;

One more time!

* Barbeque here in the South is a noun. As in :Damn, Hoss, that's
some mighty good barbeque!&quot; Allen &amp; Sons  on state route 86
is some of the finest Eastern North Carolina barbeque that you
are going to find. It is slowly roasted over hickory coals until it
falls off the bone. Then it is coarsely chopped and blended with a
subtle mixture of vinegar, red pepper, and assorted other spices.
Some hushpuppies (deep fried cornbread) and coleslaw round
out the entree. An artform of the highest caliber!
