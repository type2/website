Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

&gt; Not to be a hearless jerk, and I admittedly don't know all the details,
but on some level this bothers me.

(Do you have a hearing problem? [grin])

Having been the recipient of the kindness of others due to my wife's death
and the ensuing financial aftermath (10-year illness, approximately
$2,000,000.00 in med bills), I have to disagree with you.

Sometimes things happen, bad things.  If the good folk on this list and the
other lists, assorted VW groups, and kind-hearted individuals want to help
this mom out with another bus, I am both impressed and heartened by their
efforts to raise money for the bus.

The VW community is probably unique in this aspect (should we wait for the
Hummer or BMW crowd to do a like thing?)

A bus is a working man's (or woman's) vehicle.  It's not the safest vehicle,
but it's one that even the most inexperienced owner can work on when
necessary.  Or that you can find friends to work on if you're totally inept.
[smile]

I have two brand new cylinders because a friend at church (also a bus owner)
gave them to me to help offset the cost of my own bus's engine replacement.
The hope was that I could either sell them or give them to my mechanic in
exchange for credit towards my bus's work.  I had no idea of their value
until Richard wrote back with the info.

I'd rather drive a bus and be a part of the local and world-wide bus
community than drive a &quot;better&quot;, newer, safer vehicle.  If a group of bus
enthusiasts wants to raise money to &quot;re-bus&quot; a needy family, go for it.
Acts of kindness always come back around, it's part of the fabric of the
universe. :O)
