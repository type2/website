Jon griped:
&gt;screw caravanning, i learned the hard
&gt;way on that.  i don't mind going with one or two other busses, but 
&gt;any more than that is a major PITA

Scott sez:
Ah...you've never caravanned with SV2s before then. We actually map 
things out, plan stops in advance. And soon we won't even have to 
worry about mechanical breakdowns with the chase bus! Sure, it takes 
a little longer cause you're going as fast as the slowest bus, but 
getting there is half the fun. That's why we all have CBs on channel 
2!
