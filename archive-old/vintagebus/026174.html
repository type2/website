Hi Rachel.
You said it already without knowing.  What changed from the time you
drove it to the next time you tried to start it?

Hmmmm
Starter - it whirls over better now.  That's a good thing.
The famous unnecessary relay - shouldn't make a difference.  {Unless
these 2 are drawing so much power there's none left over to make spark -
unlikely}
Distributor cap.  That's an integral part of the ignition system.  The
wrong cap might not contact the rotor, therefore no spark.  Eureka.  If
you still have the old cap and rotor, put them back on and see what
happens.  If you were close I'd bet ya a Dr. Pepper.
Dave
