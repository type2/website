&gt; thought they were after market. Someone on this list said they might
be 195.

My records show that M194 is &quot;Larger Door Mirrors.&quot;  
I can't provide a source for this at the moment.  My records
are at home and I'm at work.

M195 remains a mystery as does M002.  I am working with
the author of the original Spec Guide of the British SSVC and
a new edition is expected this year.  Maybe our research can
track some of these down in the near future.
