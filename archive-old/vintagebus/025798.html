Hello friends,

Here's the latest update on my tranny travails...

Meredith Murray (a fellow vegetarian and very nice fella) was kind
enough to provide me with a tranny (he was told was good) to replace the
one I have that went &quot;THUNK&quot;. Sunday morning I went over to his house to
see his VW collection and help him load the tranny onto his blue and
white 64 singlecab.

He had kept this tranny under shelter, but it was obvious that the
previous owner hadn't. Still, I really need it because my bus is my only
driver, and he's offered it to me at a very good price. So, I've got
this tranny that's got mud and rust in all of the threads, shredded
boots and no oil in it whatsoever. 

Last night, I got it bolted into the body, and worked on cleaning up the
threads on the reduction boxes. Turns out that all the threads are good
(still need some cleaning up), which is kinda nice. I've had problems
with stripped threads on RGB's before. Put new boots on, filled it up
with tranny oil. Everything is very stiff on this tranny, and the drums
are stuck to it. The shifter is stuck in first gear, too.

Got the engine in and started it up in gear (on jackstands, no tires).
After a minute of thumping, it quieted down and one of the drums is
turning like it's supposed to. Put a tire on that side and lowered it,
hoping that the other side would unstick, but the tire just spun in the
dirt. It was pretty late, so I let it go at that. 

Tonight I decided to try a trick I read about in Bob Hoover's sermons...
I made cardboard boxes to fit over the drums (I soaked the drums/axles
with WD-40), lined them with aluminum foil, put 100 watt light bulbs in
them, and sealed them up good. They're out there baking right now, but I
don't remember how long they're supposed to stay in there... I'm hoping
that I've just got a stuck drum, and that it will loosen up. 

Now I just have to figure out what to do to make the shifter move. Any
suggestions? I'm prepared to take the tranny back out and check out the
nosecone if necessary.

david
