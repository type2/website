Subject: re: oil temps

Splitnosers,

  I was showing my good friend Brian (67' Falcon Econoliner) how easy it
was to pull the VW engine.  He and I were lying under the bus with our
feet out the rear in the garage with a drop light on at night, not much
room to move around, but necessary to show what needed to be done.

  I showed him the fuel line and gave him a screw driver and golf tee.  
He unscrewed the o-ring screw clamp and pulled the line off the metal tube
that went through the front engine tin.  Gas came out like a water pic
from both ends and got in his eyes (ouch!)  I looked over and saw gas hit
the incandescent light bulb in the cage of the drop light and sizzle with
a puddle of gas under it. He was saying appropriate words, while I grabed
the golf tee and stopped the flow.

  We crawled out and laughed like morons.  We were soaked in gas and had
to change clothes. We immediatly decided it was time to go to the bar, and
forget the engine pulling lesson.  Every so often we think about how lucky
we were.  God helped us!
