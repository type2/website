All,
	I've been running an optical igniton system, Allison (now Crane) for
over 12 years in my '67 bus with no problems.   I've also installed a
Crane in a '71 Ford F250 truck with good results.  I see no reason to
doubt their reliability.  I also use a Pertronix in a Beetle which does
not seem as well sorted out, though, it has not given us any problems.
