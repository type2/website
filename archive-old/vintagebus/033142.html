&lt;&lt; What color are the bumper brackets supposed to be? black?&lt;&lt;
Yes!

 &lt;&lt;Also, I know the cargo are is usually grey primer, but, I'd like to use a 
high quality primer grey auto grade paint----Do you guys know a paint code? I 
also need to paint my cab divider(thanx Eric and Barb)--should I use the 
cargo area color or a color matching my WW door panels up front?  &gt;&gt;
That will work, but there should be some original gray paint on the divider 
(We are glad you like it!) in spots to use as a color match.   Eric&amp;Barb
