Mikie,
    I think there is no better way to start as a VW mechanic than to do a
brake job. Nothing hidden or not self evident in there, Just dirty enough
and the difference when you finish is a lovely thing. Also $ saved and you
will feel good. Buy all the bits, ( I recommend NEW wheel cylinders) get the
van up, get a friend if possible and go for it. I think the VW idiot book
(Muir) is the thing to have here. Try the local library, photocopy the brake
chapter. Good luck
    Barry Wright

&gt; pardon my cluelessness, im only 18, but...
&gt; hi, my name is mike, and i just joined this type II list, so here it
goes...
&gt; i am currently restoring (probably not to original cond') a '66 bus and i
need some advice on what to do about brakes...i have been getting mechanics
to get me started on this project, cos i just started restoring, and i dont
know where to start, but i need advice on how much i should expect to pay
for a complete brake job (master cyl. and all), or if it is worth it just to
do it myself. or if it is even possible for me to attempt this myself. i
dont know much about what to do, so any advice would be much appreciated.
thank you
&gt;
&gt; mikie!

&gt; &quot;i circled the block one too many times, or       one too few, but she was
never there.&quot;
