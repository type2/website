Subject: CA DMV, need help
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I got in touch with a pervious owner of a Binz but he didn't have any of the 
serial number info or remember who he sold it to.  Does anyone know if the CA 
DMV can/will look up information on a car based on a previous owner?  
Appreciate any help offered.

Thanks,
Dan
