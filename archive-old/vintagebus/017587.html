I've been thinking about how to protect the rear of my
deluxe as well (once it gets on the road). First
thought was to keep one of those big reflective
triangles under the seat and stick it in the back
window when it gets dark. But then you've got the
&quot;old-guy-in-the-motorized-wheel-chair-with-the-buggy-whip-antenna-with-the-orange
flag-on-it&quot; look.
So, what about getting the reflective tape from the
auto parts store and making a VW emblem on a white
card. That would be safe and also look pretty cool.
You could use the nose emblem as a template. That
would be plenty big.

Just a thought, although the T3 backup light thing
does sound interesting.

probably in the 80's at least the chrome holes and
wheel wells and redux boxes are all still there but it
will be a long way back to titian red/beige grey--VW&quot;
