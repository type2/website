&lt;&lt; Where do you guys usually get your tools?  I need to buy a 215ft-lbs

 wrench, 46mm socket and a floor jack(w &gt;&gt;
I purchased my tourqe wrench and 46mm from sears(craftsman). You can jump up 
and down on stuff till it breaks if you want they still take it back(the 
stuff with a lifetime warrenty read the fine print) no questions asked.
My floor jack is an mvp SUV lift height from walmart. Far from the best, but 
comparitively low priced. walmart also has a good return policy if it craps 
out to quickly. Every once and a while you catch them on sale with a free 
pair of jack stands too.
