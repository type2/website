Subject: Price 4 used Taillights/backup lights?

Another question; What's a good Junkyard price for Backup Lights and
Taillights from a 70 Bus?  There like the ones in the 67 panel I have, only
in much better shape :).  One Taillights is excellent with a speck of hard
paint on the lens.  The backup lightd are in good shape to include lens and
bezels.  I can find a price on new Taillights, but no one seems to have the
Back up Lights.  The Junkyard wants $15 ea for the god Taillights and Back
up lights.

Also, what's a fair price for a Gas Heater from the same 70 Bus?  Did'y ask
him about that.  So I'll make an offer when I go back.

Thanks
Dave
