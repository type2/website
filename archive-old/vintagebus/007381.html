Pete,

I have used diamond lapping compound  to remove scratches from my
Seiko watch crystal. Put a Q-tip (tm) into my drill motor, put a dab
of the diamond stuff on the tip and polished away. I used 1 micron
grit for final polish. Took a while to do it but it came out ok. If
you polish just the scratches, you may end up with some optical
warping that is not  as obvious as the scratch. The diamond stuff is
available from various industrial suppliers such as J&amp;L,
Rutland/Airgas, and McMaster Carr.   You might want to start with 15
or 30 micron compound and work your way down. Cost per tube runs
around 10-21.93 per 5 gram syringe depending upon grit size.

Chris
