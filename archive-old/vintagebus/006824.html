Sayeth Kyle:

&gt; There are two kinds of people. Those that try to make Jerome every year
and
&gt; those that haven't been yet.

I'm one of the latter hoping to become one of the former this year. 
Currently holding a plane reservation that puts me in PHX Thursday 9/14
afternoon and requires me to be back at the airport Monday 9/18 AM.  I
also have a volunteer willing to taxi me to &amp; from Jerome from Phoenix.

Questions from a Jerome Virgin:

1. I'm clueless as to what to bring, camping/eatingwise.  Tent, sleeping
bag, water, freezedried apricots - it would help if I knew what, if any,
facilities are at the campground.  I realize a lot of what I bring
depends on who I hook up with, but a general picture would be helpful.

2. Do people bring toys to share?  Stuff to swap?  Or is it mainly
communing, arrhythmic drumming, griping about what a safety nazi Thom
Fitzpatrick is?  All that's cool, just wanting an idea.

3. I may be in need of a place to crash coming in or going out.  I'm not
destitute, just cheap -- and figure it'd be more fun to hang with bus
folks anyway.  Keep me in mind.

4. I *think* my Taxi mentioned something about a caravan on Friday?  If
anyone needs a spare bus driver, please keep me in mind for that, too. 
(If I drive someone else's bus to jerome do I still get a raffle ticket?
:-)

Last year when I was hoping to make it but had to bail out, I had
several generous offers of places to flop &amp; busses to drive.  This year
I'm almost concrete-certain, so I guess that means I won't be able to
find anyone. ;-)

Unless it's specific to me, please reply to the list so other Jerome
Virgins can become enlightened!

Thanks,
Joe
