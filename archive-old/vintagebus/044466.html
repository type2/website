Subject: Re: [VB] Head Stud advice

To evolve this question a bit further-  How far does an engine have 
to be disassembled before casesavers can be installed? Or is this a 
question that only Rimco would know?

Thanks, Rocky

&gt;...&gt;  replacing the first one, a few of the head studs
&gt;&gt;   backed out while taking off the nuts. I at first put
&gt;&gt;   them back in all the way threaded in, but they proved
&gt;&gt;   to be in too far to thread on the nut, so I backed
&gt;&gt;   them out some. When I went to torque them down, one of
&gt;&gt;   the studs began pulling out the case saver.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   1. Since the case saver is pulling out, can it be
&gt;&gt;   fixed, or is the case unuseable?
&gt;-------------
&gt;do you have a case saver in there?  Sounds like you may need a new (larger
&gt;one) installed.  What kind of case do you have- meaning what is the cases
&gt;serial number- unde rthe gen stand.  usually only the H or B or earlier cases
&gt;pull studs, A cases or later cases have a better alloy.   If you can get a
&gt;case saver installed it is usable.
