&lt;&lt; &gt; Mexican BOGE work great
 
 I have to say the BOGEs are dissapointing.
 Im not the only one, check the archives.
 Next time Im on the GR2s. Or maybe Id even try Monroes.
  &gt;&gt;
the KYB GR2s worked great on my 61 deluxe. Cheap mail order from Kustom 1 
imports in the Hot vws ads.  All 4 for a bus are the same as back shocks for 
a bug

I put the gas a just on the back of my 65 westy due to advice that it was 
better, and was disappointed.   

that's my 2 cents
