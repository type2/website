Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

&gt;They went the way of the $50 beetle!!
&gt;
&gt;Seriously, your hardpressed to find a vintage VW of any kind for under
&gt;$1000 being advertised. If you want something cheap, you gotta go find it
&gt;before someone else. They ARE out there...but are pretty darn hard to find.

I can vouch for that, I looked for a cheap splitty for years and finally 
found mine 3 doors down. Ended up with a 60 and a 59 for free, had the guy 
been trying to sell them I imagine it would have at least cost a $1000 for 
both.
