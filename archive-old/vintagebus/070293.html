Subject: Re [VB] vintage antenna toppers

Yea, but everyone has one of those....  I passed up a really cool space
ship antenna topper the other day but it was from the early 50's...  a
bit too old for my liking.  :-)

What, like single-wheel trailers?

&gt; Anyway, I've been looking for a vintage antenna topper from the 60's
or
&gt; early 70's and a vintage pair of fuzzy dice.

Well, the current Union Oil &quot;76 balls&quot; are the same as the ones you
could
get in the '60s... :)
