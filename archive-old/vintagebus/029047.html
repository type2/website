Subject: Re: [VB] The Best Electric Fuel Pump?

I ran an electric pump on mine for a couple of years, and I had some
trouble with it...

Bus would act like it was out of gas, or it wouldn't start... Once I
discovered that the pump wasn't vibrating, I'd thump it with a
pocketknife or screwdriver handle, and it would start back up.

I still keep it as a back-up in my spare parts stash, but prefer to run
a mechanical pump.
