The other bus is a rusty somewhat parted out 68. They gotta go because
I've not really done much with them in the couple of years I've had them.
In the last couple years I've removed a seized motor from the 66 and
swapped a running motor from the 68 to the 66. I've not even finished the
swap, just done the heavy parts. Just doesn't seem to be enough time to do
the things I want to do ...
