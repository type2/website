I'll have to do this from memory, as my bus is currently a few miles away.

Push on clips that pop out of door panels, pens, power switch for radio(had to wire an external switch to keep the original radio working), backup sunglasses, mini-compass(for when I get really lost).

I used to have my registration, insurance and Log Book, but I have been having trouble with a leaking windshield, and now don't put any papers up there.

Oh yeah, I also throw my wallet up there while driving, as it is literally a pain in the a**.
