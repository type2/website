Subject: sandblasting underneath bus

Well I just got my new tires mounted on my bus. The front end is still
slightly screwy-hopefully I can figure it out.

While it was up on the lift I was talking to the mechanic about wanting to
clean the rust off the underside-trying to rent his lift, and an air hose
hooked up to some type of grinding wheel. Sounds like he will let me do it
in the next week or two-but he suggested sandblasting.

I know there are a lot of different types of media to use when doing this. I
think I remember &quot;black beauty&quot; or something like that being recommended-and
there was a source for it relatively cheap around Boston. Anyone have
suggestions on this, also any idea how much I would need? I've got a lot of
surface rust-some a little more than surface rust.

I was planning on blasting, then painting with one of the anti-rust paints
out there-ie POR-15 or Rust-Bullet. Then maybe undercoating.

When blasting-I've got to get a mask, goggles...any other suggestions?
probably a hat-most blasting will kind of be overhead. 

Thanks for the suggestions...
