So now when you buy your smack from NQ, you *know* you'll always get
consistent quantities...

&gt;Hello everyone.  Thanks to Don Boneau, I know have a Royal ex2 digital
&gt;scale.  It weighs up to 4 pounds and it marketed as a postal scale.  I
&gt;really don't care about how accurate it really is, just the consistancy.  I
&gt;repeatedly weighed the tv remote and it always weighed 5.8 oz - yep - this
&gt;does 10ths of an ounce.  You can get them at Costco for around $24.99 - so
&gt;far, I'm pleased and even more pleased at that Don could help me out.  If
&gt;you want to see pictures of it, just go to ebay and search for royal digital
&gt;scales - there are scads of them going for too much money...
