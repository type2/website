&lt;&lt; U have piqued my curiosity. How do u shift gears in a bus without using
the clutch?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Thomas,
We are posting this to the list to help others.  Enjoy!  Well it is pretty
easy, but at first seem completely alien.  If you are stopped and the engine
is warm and running to engage first or reverse turn off the engine and shift
into one of those gears and then turn the engine on while in gear and give it
some gas.  It will jerk a bit to a start and off you will go.  Once moving in
forward in first gear accelerate and to shift up to second you want to speed
on up till you are a couple of miles faster than you would normally be in
first.  It is alot esier to shift out of first by making sure you are not
speeding up or slowing down the VW by using the engine to do either.  Shift
out of first and cross the nuetral area and then carefully smoothy slide it
into second.  You do not want to shove it in you want to offer it to second
and have it accept it it like and old friend.  What you are trying to do is
to match the bottom RPM of second gear to the engines RPM.  So it will take a
second for the engine to slow down enough from the top of first gear RPM to
the bottom of second gear RPM.  The same for second gear to third shifting
and third to fourth gear also.  Shifting at speed is another thing like sex,
the first time you do it you do not know what the %$#&amp; you are really doing
until you do it.  Just expect to take a couple of times of first to second
gear tries for it to happen for you and once that happens it will get easier
and easier as you shift each time.  So if you can do the first try of this on
a couple of miles of doing this on roads that are clear of traffic and stop
lights/signs.  In other words learn this before you need it will be a lot
easier on your nerves.  Eric&amp;Barb
