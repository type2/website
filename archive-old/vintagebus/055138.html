Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod Tube cleaning idea

Once the inside is greased and boots are o the ends
you shouldn;t have to worry about having the surface
protected by a paint. I think the potential problems
with paint on the surface would notbe wirth the
possible benefits, since grease should keep rust from
forming.

NOTE: The crud might be hardened grease.

My 69 sat in Arizona for five years with no boots and
the grease inside had hardened so much it became like
shellack in there. 

It took several attempts to ream it out and get
alltyhe hardened grease out. I broke two bushings
trying to force the rod back in past hardened grease
kling-ons.

I made a great reamer to get the crud out.

I took a piece of 3/4&quot; EMT electrical conduit from
Home Depot (about $2)  I used a hack saw to cut a
lengthwise slot in the end about one inch long, and
then another identical slot at 90 degrees from the
first.
Basically one end of the pipe had four 1&quot; cuts into
the end, evenly spaced. I then used a vice-grips to
bend each of the pipe sections outward a bit, sort of
flaring the end (the end of the pipe looked a bit like
the conical end of the shift-rod bushing, make sense?)

I then rammed this into the shift rod tunnel, the
extended curved sections of the pipe scraped the sides
clean as I pushed, and the globs of grease went into
the EMT.

It worked great!

NOTE: You have to remove the grease nipples from the
shift rod tube first.

Just a thought, it worked great for the hard grease,
might work on crud too.

&gt;  to use a shotgun clenaing brass brush with a
&gt; solvent even, and a drill to 
&gt; wire brush it clean. Any one use paint on rod or
&gt; inside tube? I thought a
&gt;  treatment/paint of some sort could be applied with
&gt; a cotton swab also for 
&gt; shotgun cleaning.  Of course, liberal greasing
&gt; before reassembly.  &gt;&gt;
