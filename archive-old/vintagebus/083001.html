Subject: Re: [VB] Fan Noise

Hi,

I had to take a hammer to my fan shroud. It was a new one from Scat and 
seems that the shape was not quite right. When it was apart, I could see 
where the fan was rubbing. Just a couple hits and all was well.

Hello out  there in bus land. I trust everybody had a good New Year. Well 
here it is, my first question for the New Year. My cooling fan is somehow 
clearancing on the doghouse and making an awful whining noise. I can give 
the doghouse a slight push tword the front of the vehicle and this seems to 
temporarily clear the noise up. I've checked the cooling tins and there is 
some bolts missing from the generator backing plate but replacing these 
would seem only to pull the doghouse more tword the rear and increase the 
problem. I see no other screws or bolts missing. What might cure this nasty 
noise? Is it possible the fan itself is not spinning true? Thanks for any 
assistance.
