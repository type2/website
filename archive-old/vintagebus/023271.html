Why not run it on the outside like the brake line?  The cables available
from WW are probably long enough.  

Does your bus have the choke cable mount in the cab?

You could route thru the belly pans; drill your acess holes in the bottom
of the center chassis section on each side, then use a long stiff wire to
find one hole from the other, and use that to pull a string in; then use
the string to pull your cable.

&gt;I want to put a Gas reserve lever in my 65.  I have a chock cable that

&gt;it also has belly pan's.  Any ideas for routing the cable thru the
&gt;middle of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;My only 2 ideas right now are:
&gt;1.  Open up the belly pan to route the cable.  (Not an option)
&gt;2.  Route the cable outside the pan's next to the gas line.  (Don't
&gt;really like that one)
