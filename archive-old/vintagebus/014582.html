Ahhh.  A few months/weeks/whichever ago, the 66 poped its rear shift
linkage coupling....cruised on home in third.

the rear screw came out fine on the old one.  But the front one wouldnt
budge.  Toasted the once-decent rear boot with the torch, while trying to
remove it.  *sigh*

So last night, I ground the head off of it, then drilled it out.  Slipped
the parts off, no biggie.  Realized that the new coupler wouldnt go in
there.  *sigh*

So this evening, I tried to remove the screw from the front coupling
(front shiftrod to rear rod..).  Snap.  Head busted right off this'n.
Great.

Now, I know I can just yank the engine and move the tranny back enough to
replace this rear coupling (and while I'm at it, replace the front mount
which I have sitting on a shelf), but I know i'm going to need to remove
that front rod at some point or another.

Is it possible for me to remove the entire 2 rod section out the rear?
(even if it means complete removal of the tranny)

no, you can't pull the rods out when they are stuck together.   The front
piece of rod has a bend in it which won't fit through the tube in the body.
You could pull it out if you cut off the front off the bus and pull it
forward, but I doubt you want to do that.    SO I would forget about the front
broken bolt at this time.     Usually the front rod is just left alone unless
it rusts through (seen that) or you want to replace the shiter bushings (sorry
very difficult for you now)   Or you want to drop the entire front suspension
out, if I remeber right, though I haven't done that for a while.   So don't
worry about it.   

if you really want to, if you have the tranny pulled back and the front shift
stick off, you can pull the rods back enough to rotate them so you can drill
straight into it.   Be VERY CAREFUL.   the soft metal collar the bolt bolts
through is very soft and easily damaged and if you mess it up it is hard to
find a decent one.  I am very nervous about those things.   If you get the
shift linkage bolted back togther just slightly askew you may have probllems
finding all the gears.    The shift linkage in my 59 SC was askew when I got
it, and until I fixed it I could not shift into reverse.

seeing as you have the 66/67 style from part of the shift linkage if your bus
is ch # 216 028 112 or later, it makes things more difficult to move stuff
around under there.   If you have an very early 66, with the earlier style
linkage, merely undoing the 2 bolts that hold the shift stick to the floor of
the cab and pullling that out of the way would I think allow enough room to
slide the whole thing forward.  not sure if you have the later type if this
will help but It's worth trying.

some buses it is easy to fit a rear coupler and some it's not. 

also, make sure the bus is in 3rd gear, but you said it was anyway.
