   The club is somewhat of a joke.  If you can run a hack saw you can get past
the club.  In fact the most humorous car thieves leave your club in the empty
parking spot that your car or bus was parked in.
     Switches to cut off ignition or fuel pump (love those electric's) are
about the cheapest most effective way to make sure your ride will stay parked
where you left it.  I've seen switches behind seats, under floor mats, visors,
and dashes.  My favorite though is hooked up to the electric antenna wire
coming out of the stereo.
      Peace, Love, and I also have the patented left turn brake lock--they may
steal the bus--but they anit gonna like driving it!
