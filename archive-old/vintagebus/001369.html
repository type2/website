Subject: Velocity Stacks installed and other stuff...
Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 22:59:23 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I got my CB Performance shorty velocity stacks tonight and installed them on
my 1776.  It still hasn't sunk in yet that I have a 1776 with dual Webers.
I'm used to seeing this in magazines and not in my own bus.  It's really
cool to be living a dream.

I ended up taking off my oil filter assembly and trying to find a place to
mount it.  I confess - I was driving with a bailing wire apparatus but now
it's time to do it right.  I would like to hear from other bus owners where
they mounted their oil filter at?  I ended up decided that I will bolt it to
the frame in the little cubby formed by the left rear fender and corner
sheetmetal.  The filter will still hang down about an inch but the bumper
will hide it and most importantly, it won't be right behind the tire.  The
only problem is that I need a 360 degree swivel compression fitting to allow
the oil lines to run up and under the frame without putting them under a lot
of stress.  I have one but need 2.  Does anyone have any suggestions where I
might look for one?  Are these common FLAPS parts or not?

In my perpetual state of exhaustion, I found out why my timing light didn't
work.  I had hooked it up backwards but I found this out after I bought
another one.  If anyone would like a brand new Sunpro trouble light (only
used once!) for $30 shipped, get in touch with me.  I paid $40 so my loss is
your gain.  I found out my timing was shooting up to 42 at full throttle so
no wonder she had a lot of pep.  Not near as much now - I've set it to 32
but I have to keep in mind that I could actually run 36 with the semi-hemi
heads I have on now.

I'm still a little fearful about this exhaust noise I hear.  My exhaust
clamp appeared okay on the left side but I reoriented it and tightened it
down good.  I won't know until the restart if I got it good enough or not.
I'll find out next week.

All fer now...
