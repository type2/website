&gt;&gt;As for the rest of the bus you should look into either styrofoam 8x4' sheets or we have been hearing of a rubberized flat roofing material that might work well.  The former product should work well as not only a sound deadener, but as a thermal insulator as well.  The roofing membrane probably will only work well as a sound deadener.   Eric&amp;Barb&lt;&lt;

Here is a subject that I'm familiar with, Dibitten (modified bitumen) roofing. I'm a home improvement contractor and have been applying this stuff for many years. It would work great for sound deadening as it is dense enough to change the harmonics of just about anything. The problem is that to get a good adhesion a great deal of heat is required. This might warp a long straight panel. Dibitten can be made to stick with less heat but then you would have voids which would trap air and moisture causing a rust problem. With all of these drawbacks I would suggest trying some of the sound deadening materials the Eastwood sells. I think that is a lot like the stuff VW put in the super.
