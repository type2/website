To the friendly and Knowledgeable list members and all Art Bell
listeners;

This is Friday isn't it?

 Thanks to Bob Hoover I've something to add to my multi fuel folder in my
e-mail...If I was to search the archives for other poop on this whole
thing what key words would I use?
 
 I worked at this import engine shop in California called rising sun
engines (look em up at www.rsemgines_dot_com) and know of Subarus and have
the scars to prove it. It's interesting to see how the Japanese copied
other companies,-- ever seen a early Land Cruiser engine? It looks like a
ch*vy 216 six but you can bet it has full crank and not dip oiling..
Here's what Colin Messer wrote Eve Muir of the venerable &quot; How to keep
your Volkswagen alive a manual of step by step procedures for the
compleat idiot&quot; book
recently about propane and air cooled engines:

&quot;The problem with air cooled engines on propane is the latent heat
issue... no liquid cooling so the air/fuel ratio has to be nuts (he
means very rich) or it burns up. That is why on gasoline air cooled
engines run rich. As you recall, lean VWs don't last long.&quot;

One can write him about it at: Bancars_at_aol_dot_com

I also remember a newzeland based web site about subaru and porche
splittie conversions. Also VW did do R&amp;D on a hybrid loaf bus. I also
remember reading about a guy who drove around the world in a fwd golf T2
conversion. I'm waiting for the windup Baygen conversion.

aloha
our hero vicariously living through the list.
