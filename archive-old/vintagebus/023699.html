Subject: more rubber brake hoses... my saturday morning.

Over a month or so, I noticed that my shifting was getting really
bad... It was hard to get the '65 in gear, and it became difficult to
change gears. It also felt like there was rolling resistance... I jacked
up the rear (last week) and found that the left rear wheel was locking
up and not releasing after I depressed the brake pedal. 
	So I removed the drum and took the wheel cylinder out, cleaned it, and
put it all back together... the problem still existed.
	A light bulb went on! I replaced the rubber brake hose for that side
with my spare... and it all worked like it should, for about one day. It
was easy to shift, and the brakes released... whew!
	Then, dang it if the other side didn't exhibit the same symptoms...
	So, off to the FLAPS on saturday morning for new hoses. I replaced all
of the hoses with new ones, keeping the spare separate and all the hoses
the same age on the bus. Both front hoses were fine, but both rear hoses
wouldn't allow even the first puff of 125 psi of shop air through
them...
	I was thinking about going with those nice SS braided teflon hoses, but
cost and convenience won the battle.
	I now have fully functional brakes and easy shifting... perhaps the
dragging of the brakes put a load on the tranny and had something to do
with that.... but it's OK now. I believe that I replaced the hoses back
in '93 or so...
