Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

Rich,
Back when driving my 67 camper with stock 14&quot; tires, or maybe 205 14s, I
remember the sweet spot was right about 62 mph.  That was a good speed and
I didn't have tach, but you know the sound when pushing it a little
higher makes it sound like it's working a lot harder. I assume it had 4.12
and it had proper RGBs.
About having to go fast, it all depends.  I sure enjoyed cruising along at
53 with the splitcase/40hp most of the time.  Other people weren't as
thrilled having to wait for me I'm sure.  Traveling on I-40 across NM/AZ
at night it was downright scary waiting for a semi to splatter me.  Spent
a lot of time looking in the rearview mirror.  My preference for a stock
engine (alot to be said for that) is 4.12 and go 62-65 maybe.
I have had several trannies and have found some good combinations.
My 58 has small nut trans.  With stock engine 15&quot; tires seem too big with
3.88.  Using 195 X 14 per Ronnie it does real nice.  They are nice strong
tires too.  A 4.12 with your RGBs is comparable I think. Stock 1600 DP motor.
My current 67 I have run a Brazilian bug transmission which would have
been great for a 40hp.  Otherwise it turned way too fast.  61mph at 4000 rpm.
With 15&quot; tires it was faster, but still not good.  Using 4.12 with 15&quot; tires
in back, 195 14 in front it turns 3700 at 71mph which seems to be fairly
accurate going by the traffic around me.  I'm going to try 3.88 to slow
the revs down.  I've had it to 80 going around a truck just temporarily.
It would really bother me to run this combination with a
stock engine though and stock is usually mo' better out on the road IMHO.
Then again if you need to make time it's nice to go fast and take your
chances.  It would be nice to have enough busses to run whatever
combination was needed for the occasion, but two busses keep me broke and
working hard enough.

John K.
