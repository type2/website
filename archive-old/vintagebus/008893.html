NQ:
Here's some advice to help your ladyfriend feel more comfortable in your
bus.
1. Take all the engine and drivetrain parts off the passenger seat BEFORE
you pick her up. A true gentleman would make sure that the junk on her side
of the floor is at least pushed to the middle side of the front floor. If
you have a walk-through, check for old candywrappers, beer cans, gatorade
bottles, mail (especially those bothersome notices from the city to remove
your junk cars etc.) pretzel bags, shoes and other accumulations of
necessary road-trip related supplies between the seats to ensure that the
pile does not exceed the actual height of the seat cushions.
2. If you have seatbelts...try and make sure that they are relatively grease
and oil free. Working buckles are considred a plus, and if your german
shepard puppy has chewed the web down to a few threads,  a little duck tape
to give the appearance of strength is reassuring.
3. Since you and I are both from the midwest, and it's unpredictable weather
we can appreciate the importance of a full set of glass in the side window,
as well as the passenger side wing. This is far more critical when your
passenger is a girl than just your fellow bus-rat buddies.
Speaking of weather, has it rained lately? You may want to drain the parcel
tray to avoid any surprise &quot;splashing&quot; during sharp turns.
One more weather-related item; I've always considered it an &quot;accessory&quot; but
I know my wife is always more comfortable in the rain when the wiper on her
side works too.
4. Women are more sensitive to smell, I'll leave the personal issues to your
best discretion, but I would make a quick &quot;sniff&quot; through the bus just to
check for stuff that may have escaped your attention after the last KFC run,
or perhaps those old workout clothes you've been wondering about.
5.Reliability, speaking from experience, it earns you big points when your
bus completes a round trip without a lot of delays. Most girls are
reasonably forgiving if you have a mechanical &quot;incident&quot; but, If it comes to
this, make sure you teach her how to &quot;bump start&quot; so that YOU are the one
that pushes. (I learned this the hard way).
Good Luck and let us know how it goes, I hope the above helps.

&gt; I know the topic sounds funny but I knew it would get your attention.  The
&gt; week of the 10th, I'm going to go see yet another nice young blonde gal
(old
&gt; workmate friend of mine) who lives an hour outside of KCMO.  She's never
&gt; ridden in a bus before but has ridden in Li'l Red my 74 Super Beetle.  I
was
&gt; wondering if there is anything can do to make sure she enjoys the ride.
All
&gt; joking aside (I'm not looking for answers such as &quot;a mattress in the back
&gt; helps&quot; or &quot;make sure your underwear is clean&quot;), you girls on the list that
&gt; like buses - is there anything you like especially?  Currently the
headliner
&gt; is grungy, seats aren't too bad, I don't have the front interior panels
on,
&gt; etc.  Should I just clean up the bus really good and bring along some cold
&gt; drinks (it'll probably be hot that day.)  I just want to make sure she
likes
&gt; the bus, enjoys the ride, and has a good time.  I don't want her to come
&gt; away hating it and disliking me for it.
&gt;
&gt; This is gonna generate some traffic I know but I'm looking forward to the
&gt; replies...
&gt;
&gt; :-)
