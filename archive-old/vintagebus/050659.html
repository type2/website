&gt; &gt; I learned a lesson recently also: If you have hoops, don't drive into a low
&gt; &gt; garage door opening without removing them before hand.

&gt; Or....
&gt; Don't forget to unload your roofrack before pulling into the garage.  I
also loaded the rack up once--BEFORE leaving the garage!

The combination of expensive stuff on the rack (such as bicycles),
electric garage door openers, and forgetfulness has caused a lot of grief!

Luckily, my rack is too tall to go into the garage at all!  :)
