&lt;&lt;  When we got there, they STILL
 weren't done, but that gave us time to inspect the front end of Billy's
 ride, which was quite squirrelly on the way out there.  Looked like one of
 the link-pin lock bolts was rubbing the trailing arm thingy, and the
 passenger side tie-rod was rubbing on the frame.  Welcome to the world of
 lowered busses eh?  Well after 30 minutes or so, the tire monkey finally had
 my rims done (minus a hub cap clip on one), and we loaded them up and headed
 home - I had to sit in the back of the bus so Billy could steer. &gt;&gt;


  the reason the bus was driving so crappy and parts were ruibbing together 
was the dude at the alignment shop put my tie rod ends on the top of the 
spindals instead of the bottom like i had them. when i got home from the 
campout i had to replace my like pin bolt because they were smashed. thanks. 
everything is placed where it needs to be and the bus drives better than ever.
