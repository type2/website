Subject: Re: [VB] At what point...

We saw the &quot;Pink Lady&quot; at the Classic, I'll send a bigger pic for your 
collection, Jim. It was part of the &quot;Freak Show&quot; along with Rex Eastman's pipe 
half-single cab and some other oddities. 




It matches the VW Eurovan limosine that sold recently on a well known auction 
site. 




My favorite was at the Classic a few years back, &quot;Crushed Velvet&quot;. Roped off car 
with easel signs, trophies, cliche-city. The car was a beetle of some sort.... 
flattened in a crusher. 




VW work... installing a repaired 2l motor in my '79 westy this weekend. Ask me 
about '79 only, California only catalytic converters! It's a good thing these 
engines hold together, they must have twice the number of parts a T2 motor has.

&gt; At what point does Shinola become something more organic?
