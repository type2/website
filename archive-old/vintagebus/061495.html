&gt; i have my engine out now. the hole on the driver side top is threaded. this

&gt; in the way of the wrench-making for a very greasy, painful, and loooong time
&gt; trying to ratche this bolt in.

Try a short extension.  It makes all the difference and allows you to get
a decent swing on the wrench handle.

&gt; i was thinking of drilling out the hole-so it is not threaded, then just
&gt; having a nut inside the engine compartment.

The thread is just an insert.  Insert the bolt into the hole and tap on
the head of the bolt and the insert pops out.

However, with a doghouse shroud, this nut is very hard to get to.  I'd try
the extension before you remove the insert.
