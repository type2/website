Do you think the reduction in oil temp is due to changing to the synthetic oil?  What
temp had you been running at before you changed out the oil?  After?

&gt; I switched to Castrol Syntec to see if it makes a difference.  Friday after
&gt; work we made the run home to NC, she ran quieter, probably because head

&gt; an oil pressure on startup and seems to maintain pressure better.  She also
&gt; ran 25 - 30 degrees cooler.
