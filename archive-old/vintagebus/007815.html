Subject: Re: [VB] My New '64 is 6 Volt, good or bad??

Hi,

There are many discussions regarding voltage. My take is that you just
can't beat starting an engine on 12V with a 6V starter. I also find it
OK to run the wipers on 12V. Finally enough speed to keep up with the
rain. Others complain of shortened motor life, well, I live in So.
Cal. with little rain so I don't worry. The headlamps are a little
brighter and a slightly degraded electrical connection is less
noticeable. The tail lamps are definitely brighter and provide a
slight modicum of safety in that the poor driver behind you is more
likely to see brake lights.

Enjoy the ride.
Chris

PS, let me know if you want a new steering wheel. I have some fresh
repops on original cores.

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; I am picking up my &quot;new&quot; 64 Camper tomorrow.  It is not currently
running, so I expect to post a bunch of questions here in the coming
weeks.  But for now I have these questions:  The bus is on the
original 6 volt system, I know you can buy kits to convert to 12 volt.
What are the advantages of having a 12 volt system over a 6 volt
system? Are parts for the 6 volt harder to find?  What are other pros
&amp; cons of each??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
