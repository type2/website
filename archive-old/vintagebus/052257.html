&gt;So I have a tach-dwell meter that I use.  Could I just extend the wires
&gt;some how and see what my rpm's are when I'm driving.

Sure.  Your meter probably has alligator clips and wants to have one
on the points wire and the other on ground.  You can get ground at
the front of the Bus (any bare metal connected to the body) so you 
really only have to extend the points wire.  Just make sure the
extension wire can't get caught on anything, or melt on the exhaust,
etc.  Check that the wires up front don't get in the way of the
controls, and make sure the meter is well secured to the dash where it
is easy to see.  It's a bummer when your test gear falls on the floor
and rolls under the brake pedal.  :)
