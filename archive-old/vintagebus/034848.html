&lt;&lt; I have noticed a few filled in holes (~1/8 inch in diameter) near the top 
outside lip of the rear gate....   The hoop rings (or whatever you call them) 
are there and then a single hole half way between each loop at about the same 
horizontal plane... &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
If there are two of those they are for the rubber bumpers to touch the later 
bumbers with the over riders.  Eric&amp;Barb
