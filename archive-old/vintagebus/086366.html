Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum diagnostics: engine strong but manifold vacuum
  fluctuates

Additional symptom (perhaps unrelated):

When pulling the plugs for the compression check, it looked as though  
#3 was running lean and #4 was running rich.

This seemed odd to me given that they're both being fed out of the  
same manifold and therefore pointed to a possible leak at the #3  
head: but where?  The cylinder-head and jug mating surface?

Or would that point to a valve issue?

I didn't verify the point gaps yet, but intend to before re-installing.

cheers,
      Tom

&gt; Well, I tried it and, low and behold, my vacuum reading - as  
&gt; measured off the center of the intake manifold (Bug Auto-stick SP  
&gt; manifold w/ Vacuum port) - fluctuates rapidly between 10-20 inches  
&gt; of Hg.
&gt;
&gt; From various websites, this tells me I may have a: Ignition miss  
&gt; (can be caused by very worn distributor shaft bushings); leaky  
&gt; valve or weak valve spring; blown head gasket.
&gt;
&gt; I've verified this behavior with another distributor, so i'm  
&gt; guessing it's not that, the heads are New (not rebuilt) so I would  
&gt; be slightly surprised if it's a leaky valve, but I could easily see  
&gt; it being a &quot;blown head gasket&quot; - i.e. shims between the jug and the  
&gt; engine case that aren't sealed properly.
&gt;
&gt; I tested compression and it came up the same for all cylinders -  
&gt; around 125 - which is probably fairly reasonable for the ~6.9:1  
&gt; compression I'm running.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any thoughts on this?  I'm about to pull the engine and  
&gt; reseal the jugs to the case, but if there's other stuff I should be  
&gt; checking first... (or perhaps measuring the vacuum off an autostick  
&gt; bug manifold isn't the best way to do it?)
