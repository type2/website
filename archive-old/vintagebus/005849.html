Son of a gun - a good roof clip to the dump?  I about fainted when I read
this.  What's wrong with everyone?  Are there that many buses out there that
we can keep scrapping their parts?  Man if Rob, Terry, or I were anywhere's
close, we'd be clawing for this stuff and putting it into dry storage.

You guys otta hold on to this stuff until we show up out there this winter.
Rob's gonna take his single cab to California and we can load up all this
stuff and bring it back here.

Man, I hate to hear this...
