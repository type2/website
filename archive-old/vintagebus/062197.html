&gt; I'm learning to understand that there is a reason for everything...
&gt; 
&gt; After missing Kelly Park, I most definitely wanted to attend the OCTO/Classic
&gt; Weekend in the worst way. Seeing old friends and getting away was looked
&gt; forward to.
&gt; 
&gt; Life and death issues keep me at home. Pending birth of a son and anticipated
&gt; funeral of a life long friend. A million dollars would not prevent me from
&gt; missing either one. Family/Friends first, VW's are down the list at this point.
&gt; Thanks to those willing to tow, take, drive, show or pimp the '67 Westy RFH but
&gt; I will keep it at home with me.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone have fun and travel safe. Take lots of photos and post them asap for
&gt; the rest of us to enjoy.
&gt; 
&gt; The '67 Westy remains for sale. Pmail me for details and pricing if interested.
