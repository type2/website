&gt; There has recently(last couple of years) been a setup created by a guy in

&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure why these have not caught on much yet, but I expect it will.

I'm currently using on e of these, and I'm pretty happy with it. There are
a few issues:

1) It will only filter oil when warm. Only oil that flows through the
cooler will get filtered.


2) The filters can be a bit of a pain to remove without getting oil on
everything

3) You have to cut a hole in the fan shroud
