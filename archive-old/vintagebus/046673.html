Hi Rex,
Ooops, Houston we have a problem!  Both the inner and outer front bearings on 
all ACVWs should just slide off the spindles!  Sounds like time to rent a 
bearing puller and get it off.  Followed by making sure that part of the 
spindle is not damaged badly and/or sanding/polishing this area of the 
spindle to let a new bearing slide on by hand.
 
 &lt;&lt;Also, a home DIY on packing the bearings and hub with grease and putting 
it all back together would be nice. Any tips or procedures appreciated. I'm 
green on this one. &gt;&gt;
the Idiot's manual has a good set of instructions on this.  There are mainly 
two things you really have to be carefull of.
   Do not quite fill the area the bearings ride in with grease.  Completely 
filling will make the grease stir itself constantly and heat up to the point 
that it no longer lubricates properly.
   Do not overtighten the spindle nuts that hold on the bearings and drums.  
When the metal of these parts heat up from normal usage they expand!  If the 
nuts have been tightened too much this expansion will make the parts press 
against each other more, creating more friction and heat.  Which in turn 
causes more expansion and thusly even more friction and heat , etc., etc..  
The viscious circle goes on until the bearings weld themselfs to the drum 
and/or spindle.
