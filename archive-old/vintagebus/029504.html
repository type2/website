After all the work I had done on Frodo my '65 Westy I was about tapped
out of funds. I had about $600 for the final paint job. I went to the
local Earl Schiebs and spent some time talking to the Manager. I told
him how hard I had worked for 3 years to get it to this point. I asked
him if he felt that his painter was up to the task of painting the bus.
Maybe it is a Nebraska thing but I believe taking a little time spent
getting friendly with the folks in the shop payed off in the long run.
After discussing the possibility of small flaws I was satisfied they
would do their best. I asked to talk to the guy that would actually
paint Frodo. He spoke a little broken english but the only language I
needed to speak was cash. I told him I had $50 cash extra for him if he
did a extra good job.
Final cost was $550 w/bribe. That was for 2 colors and clearcoat outside
and full inside paint. Most of the people that saw Frodo at BNNTA this
year were impressed at the final look. I am thrilled with it and the
paint is looking perfect even after 1000 miles of high driving.
