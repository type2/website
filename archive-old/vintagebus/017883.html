Well, you're in the same boat I was.

There weren't any &quot;standards&quot; yet.  Remember how everyone was arguing
ad-nauseum over early 60's fabrics?  

The cabinets in mine just sat there, bordered by 4 rubber bumpers like
the ones used on singlecab gates.

I've seen very few early westy brochures, and the detail isn't enough
to be able to discern anything.

Did you buy Scott's westy, or is this a different one?
