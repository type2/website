Hi all

Just another two questions about my semaphores on my 59 pannel so here goes:

1. The two terminals on the semaphore which wire goes to which terminal or does it not matter?

2. Is it common for the wire that goes to the globe, in the semaphore, to burn out? and can it be replaced with a new wire? and will it have to the same sort of wire? as it is fine wire or will any wire do?

whoops a few more than two questions....

thanks for the help
