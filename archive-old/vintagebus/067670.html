well, don't freak or anything.

But it does help the engine warm up quicker, which is good for engine life  
both in cold and warm climates,  and also good for interior heating.  the 
flaps in th fan shroud also direct the air for better cooling when the 
Tstat's open.   Gene Berg did a bunch of tests on them, it's on some gene 
berg webpage (sorry no url here)

I'd accumulate the stuff and install it next time you pull the motor.
