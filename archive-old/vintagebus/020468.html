Hi List  Mark here.....I have a short trip report.A
couple of days ago I cranked up Ol'No Name with her
sick little 1200 and off we chug on the backroads 7
miles to the beach here in Central Calif.No big deal
just take some good walking shoes to get to a phone if
and when she goes flat.Made it to the beach
early...sack out in the back and get a couple of
ZZZZZZ's wake to sunshine and beach time.I am a bit to
old to chase the babes anymore so I just enjoy the
water and sun untill that gets to be to much.Then back
to the bus to a cold soda and some shade...ready for
another go...back in the water and somemore breakers
on my head...water temp about 55 air temp 80 or
so.Find a spot on the sand and streach out and warm
up.Tomorrow night is the 4th of July so it will be
fireworks on the beach and fireworks in the sky at
Pismo.   Have Fun All where ever your &quot;Beach&quot;
is.....Mark 67 Deluxe 13 window Ol'No Name.......
