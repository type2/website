Subject: Re: [VB] constantly running on three cylinders 

Hi Thomas,
We agree with the other posts, but could possibly maybe perhaps be a bad spark plug, wire or even distributor cap.  Also what does the other spark plugs look like?!?!?  Carb could be running way too rich and that one plug/cylinder just carbons up faster than the rest.
