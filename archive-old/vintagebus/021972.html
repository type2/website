	I have all the parts in a local ad and I already have a few bids from
an old guy he wants the whole deal for three hundred......As for the backseat
all you listees will have to bid yourselfs and I'll see  What I can do...As
for the sunroof parts tell me what you'll give me....If I can get over three
hundred for the parts then I can part it out to all of you....I'll keep you
posted.....And if anyone is wondering the only good parts are inside and
front doors mainly....The front end was hit and it had a spare tire mount on
the front so  it was really banged up....The rear body work is buried up to
the engine apron......And I don't recal jail bars...I'll take another peek
but I don't think they are there....
