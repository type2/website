I had the privilege of visiting with Thom this weekend, and had a real nice 
time.  If anyone gets the chance to stop by his place, I highly reccomend it.  
It is a rare opportunity to see the structural guts of a 54 bus (he also keeps 
a 12 pack of Sierra Nevada on hand for guest). Anyway, after seeing his 
interior mirror/visor, I have a question for the list. I have always heard 
that square edged mirrors meant that the mirror was earlier.  Thoms 54 bus has 
a square mirror.  I recently saw a 53 with a rounded edge mirror that is 
original to the bus.  This makes me think that the year might have nothing to 
do with square vs round mirrors. Any thoughts on this?
