Subject: Re: [VB] Spark prug blew out!

I had this happen to my bus about 5-6 years ago, unfortunatly for me, it was
already heli-coiled by the PO, so the head was pretty much toast.

I believe a time-sert would be a good option to go with.

&gt; &gt; My number 1 spark plug blew out last night and now it wont screw in it
just
&gt; &gt; slides in and out and doesnt bit any threads. Any clue what to do here
and
&gt; &gt; how it happened? Oh yea its a 74 bus with a 2000 in it.
