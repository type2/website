Has anyone out there considered converting a trans to a berg 5 speed? keeping 
gearing close to stock but having a 5th gear for the highway.  keeping the 
reduction gears and stock height. Does anyone have any experience with this 
conversion in ANY application? I'm just kicking ideas around. No flames 
please, I'm considering this for my POS dormobile. Unrestoreable.
