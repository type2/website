 &lt;&lt; if you have the time, the best thing for removing pop outs is &gt;&gt;
 Hi Volks,
 If you do not have time and it is on a bus that no way can be saved you can 
 just disconnect the latch from the inside of the body.  Then on the outside 
 of the bus you open the popout to about 30-45 degrees open.  Grab the top 
 rear corner of the window with both hands and pull down.  The spot welds 
 holding the hinge (See Andy we learned! ;-) ) to the body will pop apart 
like 
 a postage stamp.  Eric&amp;Barb

er... yes.   I have also bent frames doing this.    but then again, they 
could probably be un bent.
