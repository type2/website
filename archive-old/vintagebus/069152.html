&lt;&lt; So I posted before requesting glass for the windows of my 60.  What I need 
is
 both pieces that go in each door - not the small pivoting piece but both 
other
 two pieces.  I could also use the latches for the pivoting pieces and for the
 sliding pieces.  I got a couple responses to my last post and I replied but I
 have heard no more - hep me jesus.
 
 TIA &gt;&gt;
If you are asking specifically for the sigla glass, yes that is hard to find. 
  If you are happy to use sekurit glass I am sure you can find some pretty 
easily.
I believ new latches are availabel for the triangle windows.  you do have to 
remove the glass to install the latches, and be very careful if you have 
sigla glass.

If the cracks are small in your sigla glass, Iwouldn't wory about it.
