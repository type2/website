Subject: Re: [VB] Re: fleetlines / 10 digit serial number/ pic

hm, okay then.  let go with 

 265 2xxx xxx.  

 remember, I did say a 75 *truck*, which is model 26, and the the 1st two #s of the vin are the model.

  well, it makes sense I guess that some big organisation decided to standardise VINs.

&gt; 2x5 2xxx xxx.  Apparently this was some kind of international standard;
