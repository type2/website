So Sunday, the day of the show, I am awakened bright and early by the sound
of Woody's 64 Kombi being fired up to transport him, Crusty and Matt off to
the show to scam up on the early-bird swap meet deals.   It must have been
around 6AM or so, and raining, so I just slithered back down into the bed
and went back to sleep.  I didn't wake back up until Dawn's mom came
knocking on the bus to get me up, saying it was about 9am already!  (I still
hadn't figured out I was in a different time zone I think).  We hastily
broke camp, and pulled out of Pontiac lake about 9:45ish, with Chris Walsh
in the lead.

Chris did his best to lead us through the myriad of detours, but got us lost
anyway, and in a not so good looking part of town.  Grosse Point, it was
not.  Luckily, someone else headed to the show had seen us turn off the
route, and stopped to help get us back on track.  By the time we got to the
show, it was nearly 11AM. And the sun had come out and the temperature risen
dramatically...  I was dying in my sweater and long pants!  I was charged
like a buck or something to get in, and did my best to get into the show.
Man, it was crowded!  And there was no one around to direct us to where we
were supposed to park, or help guide us through the crowds. I crept along
through the crowd, which was very slow to get the hell out of my way, with
the dog freaking at some other dogs he was spotting, and me sweating like
hog.

I finally found me a spot respectably far enough away from the night-club
volumed country music that was playing over the PA system, however we were
packed so close together in the parking lot, I was so close to a late model
Ghia that I almost couldn't open my cargo doors!  On the other side of me
was about the ugliest late-model bus I've ever seen in my life.  The Ghia
next to me though, was just an ordinary late-model Ghia, about a 73 or 74
maybe, with a fresh Maaco Late model Ghia green paint job.  Like I've never
seen one of those before.  &lt;grin&gt;  Anyway, I proceed to get out of the bus,
and get the dog on the leash, when I notice the owner of the car watching me
rather intently.... She seems rather nervous.  I proceed to set up the
Missouri Micros banner on the side of my bus, and set up the German flag I
fly on a wooden dowel rod from the roof rack.  The Ghia woman is totally
spazzing about this time.  She asks me if the dog is going to jump on her
precious Ghia and scratch it.. and the BEST part was when the wind caught
the German flag and blew it in the direction of her car...  leaning the
wooden dowel flag pole in the direction of the precious gem...  the woman
let out an audible gasp!  As if a 3 foot long wooden dowel would harm her
paint, and as if a little scratch on a green late model Ghia would be such a
travesty to begin with!

I was greeted right away by Paul and Lisa, and his sister Michelle, whom I
have know for a few years now from the MOFOCO shows, and our own Octoberfest
camp-outs.  Paul was there with the whole family - his 2 kids whose names I
can't remember, in the VERY rusty but trusty velvet green '67 Westy he
drives.  Paul's Westy was just seen on TV in the show &quot;Early Edition&quot;  in
which they had painted it yellow for with some sort of water-soluble paint.
&gt;&gt;From there, I made my way through the swap-area, with dog in tow, to try and
score a few things for my VW's.  I'm still searching for a door-cabinet for
my SO-33 Westy, and the large dinning table for said Westy, and a Sahara
Beige radio block-off plate for my '67 bug... oh, I also am still missing
the &quot;P&quot; style church key for my bus! None of which was to be found at this
swap...  for this big a show, I thought the swap was really quite lame.

Once back to the bus, I had discovered the Ghia lady had left... oh well,
it's probably better that way.  I tied up the dog to the side of the bus,
and set off with the cam-corder.  One of the 1st people I ran into was Jaime
Rivers, from that country up north where things are a lot more expensive.
We caught up an things since 'Everybus' and walked about the show together.
I also ran into another guy from that country up north were they sell ham as
'bacon' that I knew from Busses on the Blue Ridge.  And, other than Pat
Hoffman from St. Louis, I really didn't see anyone else there that I
knew....  OHHH...  lets not forget though the chance meeting between I and
&quot;Big Earl&quot; of Splitzine fame.  You're right Cletus, know Big Earl is a
life-changing experience.

The cars there were pretty darned kewl.  There was a lot of awesome stuff
that you never get to see in the shows around St. Louis.  There was more
split-oval Beetles there than you can shake a crank-start handle at.  I even
got to see a Kubelwagen and Schwimwagen in person for the 1st time in my
life! There was also a lot of busses I hadn't seen before, including a few
flip-seat campers.  The concession stand also was selling the biggest Polish
Sausages on bun that I've ever seen in my life.  But man o man, did it get
hot and sunny that day!  Temps were in the high 90's according to the
thermometer in the bus, and I also walked away with a hell of a sunburn on
my neck and the tops of my feet.   The mini-museum in the headquarters was
pretty darned kewl,  with that Telefunken bus in there, and an early Westy
in pristine condition.  There was also a '43 KdF Wagen in there just like
Dick Christensens, only in worse shape &lt;grin&gt;, the hood badge on the bug in
the museum is Dick's reproduction!   One other thing I really enjoyed about
the show was the very low stink-foot count in attendance!

During most of the show, I could be found wandering around with Paul and
Michelle, or fellow radial-tire hater Todd Swangstu.  This is important to
note now because of the detail I'd like to relate.  The night before at the
campground, Woody had mentioned he was buying a complete SO-33 interior from
Todd.  This is the same interior Todd had offered to be some time ago, but
understandably, he didn't want to piece it out, and I couldn't justify
spending 400 beans just for a cabinet and a table.  Well, Woody decided to
buy the whole thing just for a few odds and ends he needed, and just store
the rest for use in a later project.  Well, when that was mentioned, bells
and whistles went off in Crusty's and I's minds!  Crusty wanted an SO-33
setup for the panel, and said he could live without the table and door
cabinet.  Woody would gladly sell me the table and door cabinet. So, Woody,
Crusty and I would all leave Toledo with complete SO-33 interior!  All was
happy!   Well, when it came time to pack up and follow Todd back to Toledo
to pick up the interior, Crusty approaches me  and says he needs the table
after all, and also that he wants the door-cabinet too!  And he didn't even
bring any K-Y along!   Man, love ya Crusty, but I've never experienced such
a Kalifornia mentality this far East!  So, Crusty, you back-stabbing,
cut-throught,  hill billy, late-model driving bastard!  It is now your
morale imperative and sovereign duty to send me detailed schematical
drawings and blueprints of the table, so I can attempt, however feebly, to
make a reasonable facsimile for myself!  &lt;big grin&gt;

Well, Woody and Crusty wanted to stop for a sit-down type dinner on the way
out, and they drive at about warp 6 anyway, so I elected to follow Todd and
the rest of the Toledo gang back.  (I was still going to Toledo because I
had nothing better to do, and I wanted to check out Todd's stash &lt;gin&gt;).  I
elected NOT to swing up in to Canada for fear of being trampled by a moose.
( I hear they are a big problem up there).  We all headed out, with Todd in
the lead in his 61(?) Westy, a couple of NB's, one of which was towing a 51
Beetle!, and I brought up the rear.  After a few wrong turns in all the
detours, we were at the highway.  We all stopped to gas up, and Todd noticed
that the construction was so bad, it had made the front page of the Sunday
paper!  The headline read: &quot;You Can't Get There From Here&quot;...  Geesh, they
sure weren't shittin' at that!  So, after gas and a few  snacks, we all
headed off at a comfortable pace of about 55-60mph.  It was too much to
handle for the NB guys though, and after a few miles they tore off ahead,
except for the guy towing the 51.  That was pretty cool following him... the
51 completely blocked the NB from sight, and I could at least PRETEND I was
following a 51 Beetle on the highway!

Upon arrival at the Swangstu compound, Todd's main squeeze Carrie informed
us that Crusty and Woody had called about 15 minutes ago!  Zoiks!  How the
heck did they stop for dinner, and STILL beat up here!?  We waited for them
to call back, while Todd gave me the tour of the stash at his house...
There was a body of a split-oval bug in the back yard, various Westy parts
and a bastard motor in the garage,  some early beetle next tot he garage,
and the beset was Todd's restored and very beautiful Euro-'57 Sunroof Bug
complete with working semaphores and a KpH speedo. When Woody finally called
back, we decided to take the bug out to meet them at the storage facility
with.  Man that bug sure drove nice!  Upon arrival at the storage facility,
we found Woody and Crusty had already dipped into the mini-keg of Warstiener
beer, and the guy who was towing the '51 was there as well.

Todd's storage garage has quite the treasure in it.  A SO-44 Westy, with
Doormobile roof, wood-slate roof racks, and a '60(?) flip-seat (I think)
Westy with like 20,000 original miles on it or something crazy like that.
This thing is MINT, and totally complete, right down to the wedge-pillows
and tumblers.  We spent a few minutes admiring the horde, and then it was
time to haul the SO-33 interior out.  This was the 1st time I've ever seen
the table and door cabinet in person!  Or at all for that matter, I've never
been able to find decent pics of the items anywhere.  Looks like the table I
could make pretty easily, there's not much too it at all.. the hardest part
would be making some sort of leg that can fold up like the original.
Perhaps I could just pilfer one off a late Westy table?  Anyone out there
know?

Now, for the tricky part.  And that would be trying to get a complete Westy
interior into Woody's bus, which already had its own interior in it!  I must
say, watching Crusty and Woody try to get this stuff in there, with nearly
the entire barrel of Warstiener in them, was the single most entertaining
thing I've seen all year long! I wish I had my video camera with me, it
could have won me 10G's on that really obnoxious show..  you know, the one
they should just change the name of to &quot;Takin' it in the Groin&quot;.
Unbelievably though, they managed to get the whole damn thing crammed into
the bus, and I do mean without ONE inch to spare!  It was quite incredible.

With that done, it was time to party Toledo style!  Todd led us to a local
popular hang-out,  where we had many Rolling Rocks and consumed an
absolutely astonishing amount of peel-n-eat shrimp.  We literally ate all
they had in the place!!  I also had a giant Gyro, and a big-ass pile of
home-fries.  Looking at VW's and baking in the sun all day sure works up an
appetite!   I however, was not as lucky as Woody was in getting one more day
out of the 'camper colon'  and in a sudden attack, I had to run and drop
many, many friends off at the pool. I'm not sure, but I think the toilette
is probably STILL clogged to this day... sort of a monument to what a fun
weekend is all about.

On the way back to Todd's place, with Woody and Crusty following, it was
time to reap some revenge.  Let's just say that Todd gave the term &quot;Moon
Roof&quot; a new meaning while stopped at an intersection.  While demonstrating
one of the many uses of the 'Moon Roof' however, the light changed, and as
if we weren't attracting enough attention as it were, Woody lays on the horn
to make sure EVERYBODY got to join in the fun.  With Woody's high-power H4
halogen headlamps shinning, I'm surprised no one suffered permanent retina
damage from the glare.  I guess they were wearing their Joo-Janta 2000 Peril
Sensitive Sunglasses at the time. The worst part was that as soon as the
light changed, Todd jumped right back down into the seat without taking time
to um, compose himself, so there I was ridding along in a oval bug with a
guy who had his shorts down around his ankles...  (Well, you see officer,
it's like this....)

Back at Todd's place, Crusty educated us on how to identify various Bastard
40-horse engine parts, Todd showed off his vast vintage Schwinn collection,
and we all saw what happens when you drive your bus on 40 year old bias-ply
tires.  It was getting pretty late by that time, so we all began parting
company.  I could have stayed and left in the morning (hey, I ain't got
nothin else to do!), but I decided that the drive from Toledo back to St.
Louis would be one hell of a days drive, so I decided to get a head start.
I followed Woody until their turn towards Chicago,  watching Woody swerve
and weave all over the highway at about 40mph (man Woody, you should have
slept that one off before leaving!!), and shortly we parted ways on the
interstate.   I drove till whatever highway I was on met up with 70 West,
and I stopped at the 1st rest area to catch a few hours of ZZZ's.  It was
about 3:30AM when I pulled in, and there was a Vanagon Westy parked there
too!

In the morning, the Vanagon was gone already.  I got up and did my morning
thing (orange juice and powder doughnuts again), and was on the road by 8.
The drive was great!  Temps were low, there was a gentle wind from the
south, which was a bit tricky to handle with my steering being all cock-eyed
&gt;from the small spare, but, I've driven much worse in my day.  I drove
straight through without hardly and rest stops, and arrived back home in St.
Louis about 3:00PM or so.  Man, what a trip!  I went inside, showered up,
and slept for about 2 days.  I didn't even bother to unpack the bus for a
day or two! (man, that cooler could have been declared a bio-hazzard!)

I will definitely be trying to go back next year, and hopefully the big beer
and BBQ bash will be held again....  But even without, it's well worth the
trip.  I'll even bring along some Moose-Repellant so I can go to Canada!

And for now, it's time to start making new panels for the Westy, and get
ready for Busses Doing Nothing!
