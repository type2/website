&lt;&lt; Now what do I do about the inner and rear areas of the rims?  Do they get
 semi-gloss black?   Also, do the bumpers get coated all white, or is it just 
the front that is white and the inside (area closest to the body of the bus) 
get semi-gloss black as well?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
The rims at the factory seem to have been pianted black, and then quickly 
painted the color for the bus on the outside only.  With a little over spray 
getting to the inside.  This could have been because of the old body workers 
trick of painting something black to see if there were any imperfections, 
plus sealing out the rust at the same time.  Black paint shows imperfections 
better than any other color.  As far as we have ever seen the bumpers were 
painted all white.  Eric&amp;Barb
