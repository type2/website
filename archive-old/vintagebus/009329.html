This started out on the type2 list ... I think

Hi Dana

I read your post about the Custom officials.
Man, do I ever feel for you!
I would be ripping mad if anyone ever damaged my bus! no pun intended!
I don't think I would ever calm down! Just my nature I guess,,,
The part I don't understand, you said that , coming back into the States
into Vermont you  were
detained again by Canadian authorities??
This sounds like you should have been talking to the USA Guards at this
time???

When you leave CANADA , you are entering AMERICAN soil... and the AMERICAN
guards territory

I personally have travelled out of Canada, and back many times,, I even
purchased my westy In Detroit. I only live 80 minutes from Buffalo. I have
gone to Buffalo just to see the other side of Niagara Falls,,,,

I have never, ever, been hassled in my VW BUS....mind you, it is a fairly
clean,,,Bay window Bus!
My ponytail is long gone.......   and I am always polite and answer directly
to them.

......sound of me knocking on wood!

&gt;Hey all. . .

&gt; I decided to head into Canada, crossing at Saut Ste.
&gt;Marie.  Big mistake.  I got stopped as I was crossing
&gt;over.  Canadian police (Mounties?) proceeded to tear
&gt;apart my car looking for drugs presumeably. Ripping
&gt;off door panels, opulling up carpet. . .   They even
&gt;cut the vinyl on my rear bench seat and ripped the
&gt;padding out.  After nearly three hours of this and
&gt;much protestation on my part they let me on my way.  I
&gt;proceeded on to Montreal, and places east.
&gt; Then, coming back into the States into Vermont I was
&gt;detained again by Canadian authorities, asked to
&gt;remove all of my belongins and they once again
&gt;searched my car.  Fine, whatever...I have nothing to
&gt;hide. . .
&gt; Two weeks on the road softened the blow of this
&gt;harrassment, but I honestly feel that they pegged me
&gt;because of the Vehicle I drive.  Has anyone had
&gt;similar experiences?  Do I have any recourse for the
&gt;damage caused, particularly to my rear bench seat,
&gt;which was original.  Can I sue Canada?
&gt;
&gt;BTW the trip was great, the beast ran excellent.
&gt;
&gt;Dana
