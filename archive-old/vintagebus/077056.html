&gt; I am trying to find one more 15&quot; Bus rims fro my son's 66 Splitty.
&gt; I found 3 awhile back put new clips on and had them powder-coated
&gt; White. The look good with the  chrome hubcaps.Several deals for the
&gt; fourth fell through as I had no more money at the time. Someone sent me a
&gt; link
&gt; to a vendor that had some. I have looked through the archives without any
&gt; success.
&gt; Musta been a private message.Any one out there know where I can buy 1 15&quot;
