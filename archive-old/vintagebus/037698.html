 i saw in the most current issue of VW Trends, in the back cover, Cal Imports 
 has a stainless muffler fo $99. my bus is kinda loud and i was thinking of 
 replacing the muffler. my question is... i know this muffler is for a bug, 
 but will it bolt up to my bone stock 1500sp? performance? i have heater 
 boxes too. or, maybe someone makes a stainless one for the bus that i dont 
 know of. as much as its frowned upon by vintage nazi's, i do like the sound 
 the beetle mufflers spit out.
 later,

I like the sound of a bug miffler too.  The problem with putting it on a bus 
is not the sound but the way the air circles round the back of a bus, it 
throws the exhaust back at the bus and can infiltrate it to cause you exhaust 
smog brain damage.  Like when your bus leaks oil you see it all over the back 
of the bus from the same air circle in back there.   As half the buses are in 
So Cal, it makes sense that people ignore this.  What's a little more smog to 
breath?  The bus muffler is designed so the exhaust gets left behind the bus.
