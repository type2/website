Subject: 40HP Muffler from WW

Volk-a-maniacs,

Two requests:
1) I have finally opted to go with a bus muffler rather than what was quickly
available and worked (header + dual muffler).  So, I ordered the setup from WW
and darned if I don't need a good picture to figure out just how this thing
should go together.  I can figure it out, it's not rocket science, but I want
to see one on a bus.

Referencing these parts (items 13, 17, 20, 21) on this page:
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wolfsburg/fuelsystem/bus_mufflers.htm

Can someone direct me to a picture/some pictures on an installed setup like
this?
I'm one of those see a picture and then do it kind of guys... if you couldn't
tell.

2) I have the Bentley 63-67 Workshop Manual and find myself using it more and
more.  Has anyone gone through the effort to build a complete index for this
book?  It kind of comes with some, but is really vague on sections and there
are a lot of goodies that should be indexed (like page A-13 and A-14, which I
have just recently used).  I seem to find new things every time I look through
it, but would rather not have to look through it to find the things I need to
reference.  Anyone?  Anyone?

Thanks in advance for your help on either of these two requests.
