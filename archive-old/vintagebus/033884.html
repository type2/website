I am about to install a Varga rear brake Cylinder ($13.95) in my 1970 Westy.  
Apparently they are interchangeable from 55-71 (according to Rocky Mount 
Catalog).  I ordered mine from Hilltop Motors (VW shop nearby) and didn't 
even think to ask who manufactured the cylinder so I hope it's decent.  If it 
fails like the last one I will let you guys now.

70 Westy (still bleeding but doctor on the way)
89 Schwinn (purveyor of saddle sores)
