Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Price Watch URL

Damn! the Bible study group would not approve but hey!, the price of petrol is
indeed starting to climb. I joke about the $200. diesel Dasher that I plucked a
month or two ago but I think that it may come in handy as things progress.
The F150 with the 300 6cyl is topping $50. for a fill up lately. Whew! I miss
the $10 fill up with 92 octane in the old EZ camper. Planning on this weekend
as time to spend getting the Dasher and the lastest '63 EZ camper on the road.
CYA and beware the Ides of March from what I hear. Pray for Peace and mount
bayonets in the meantime. Advisable to shop like a hungry LDS housewife for a
few weeks. No slight intended, just the opposite. Those &quot;whacky Mormons&quot; and
survivalist might come up looking like geniuses in the coming months. Best to
buy a few cans of beans and extra motor oil.
