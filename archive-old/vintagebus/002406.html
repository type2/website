Hello Everyone I have a 67 deluxe that was pretty low when I got it. The
tires in the front of this bus were 185 60 14 and they are pretty low. I
have a set of Porsche alloys and have adapters on the front and back of this
bus that allows them to fit. It brings the rims out about an inch so the
tires need to taper in a little bit. I was wondering if anyone new or has a
bus right now with adapters could tell me what is the best type of tire to
put on my rims (15X6inch). I know this is a taboo on this list but if anyone
could tell me I would appreciate it!

Sincerely
Eric and Christy Lykens
