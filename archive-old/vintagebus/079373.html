I like your trusting assumption of our rear bumpers being held together with 
original splashpan bolts...

anyway... believe there's 8mm hexes on my 65, but I assembled that bumper 
from parts, and think I got the bolts from , well I left them on he splash pans 
so as not to lose them, but can't remember what years the splash pans came 
from.  So if the change was at the 13mm/14mm crossover, I'd say the later ones 
were 8mm.

I don't like repro rear bumper brackets.

head.  So, all members with splash pans, go out and see if an 8 or 9 mm
wrench fits on the bolts holding your splash pans right by the engine
compartment.  They should be kamax 5D.
