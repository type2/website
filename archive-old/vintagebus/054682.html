VWoA had better remember what got them where they are now. Their new
watercooled, shiny, excuse for an automobile sure did not.

I would pay 100 bucks to be able to pound some sense into their skulls
concerning what they are doing to OUR industry.

Needless to say, I will never own one of their new &quot;cars&quot; I would rather
cruise in a Horse drawn buggy first.

&gt;   One of the reasons there are no part numbers is because one of my
&gt; importer/manufacturers has been fined $65,000.00 by VWoA, even though a
lot
&gt; of his product was imported from Germany, Mexico and Brazil and was
&gt; authorized VW but not for export to the U S A. VWoA is very anal and is
&gt; doing nothing else but hurting this industry. I could go on and on but we
&gt; have all heard it and the list has allready been there on this subject.

&gt; &lt;&lt;  no the VW part numbers have been removed
&gt;
&gt; Is this because of VWOA? I think that is ridiculous,
&gt; if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe they
&gt; should get in the business.

&gt; Not defending all/any VWOA decisions, but they are
&gt; just protecting their copyright. It's just easier to
&gt; deny use across the board rather than by individual
&gt; case. If they didn't, it could start a precedent with
&gt; a company (ala GEX) offering VW-logo pot metal
&gt; pistons...
&gt; On a similar note, Rolls Royce sued an aftermarket
&gt; company for selling fiberglass Beetle &quot;hoods/bon-
&gt; ets&quot; with the RR grill.
&gt; ...And Harley-Davidson tried to copyright the &quot;po-
&gt; tato, potato&quot; sound of their twins...
