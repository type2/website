Subject: Re:  [VB] muffler mess
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Always attach loosely  all parts of the taillpipe assembly before tightening 
any bits down.  Have not had any problems doing it this way, even when some 
parts are new and some used.    Except with the muffler that was mushed  on 
that side due to an errant driver.   a hammer sorted that out.
