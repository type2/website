now, I've got a MIG and was thinking about getting gas. Up until now I used
it without gas (it works both ways). See, I want to be able to make decent
looking welds...... how big of a bottle should I get?? I only want to
replace front floors and cargo door piece (floor+rocker). Can I still use
same wire to weld or should I get new one?

Subject: [VB] Welder Gas


&gt; I finally got gas for my lincoln sp-100t welder. I bought the welder a few
&gt; months back, but only just now had the money to get the gas. It cost me
&gt; almost $200 for a tank full of gas!!! That was mainly the cost to buy the
&gt; actual tank. Luckily it's only $40 to get it refilled. At least it's done.
