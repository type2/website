Subject: Re: [VB] RGB's - pros and cons?

Only time I've seen damage to RGBox components was when the bearings had 
gotten worn out and there was bad slop.   This gives warning (rumbly noises).  
Unfortunately once was in my 61, but I was 700 miles from home when the noise 
started, and ended up needing a new axle shaft when I got home as the upper outer 
bearing was toasted, which slopped the bejebus out of the end of that axle, 
and the clip holding area was worn away.  These RGs are hella beefy, but 
bearings wear out eventually. Particularly if the tranny was ever run low on oil.  I 
have also rebuildt RGboxes with very worn bearings where the RGBs were 
completely undamaged, just pulled the old bearings and put new ones in.  If you have 
ever taken the cover off one, you'ld see that they are very simple as well.  
or look in the pics in your Bentley

if you remove the RGBoxes you need to pull the tranny and flip the ring gear 
to the other side, or you get 4 reverse gears and one very low forward gear.  
You also have to install certain year (68?) bug or type3 axles/tubes.

this makes the bus higher geared by a 1.26 or 1.39 ratio depending on your 
RGs.   This may be high gearing for your motor, making the bus feel wimpy.   
Because the engine/tranny is now set up like a bug.   The bus being bigger and 
carrying more weight was the whole reason they put the RGBs in in the first 
place.  So then you might want to build a bigger motor.  

 Oh, the bearing areas on these axles do get worn, so that is one issue to 
check when getting such a set up.  I've heard it suggested that putting the 
straight axles in a bus puts more wear on that area (one bearing instead of 4) but 
have also seen straight axled buses that have run around for years.  The main 
pro is that the bus is higher geared, so if you put a phat motor in, you can 
drive faster. 

  It also lowers the bus.   some people like that, but I find it impractical, 
but then I like to be able to haul stuff, go camping off road, and not scrape 
going into/out of driveways.  Anyway, you'd probably want to change the front 
suspension to match, if you lower the rear axle.

So there you go, redo whole running gear. ya, not an afternoon's work

I am pro RGB.   I am happy driving 60mph in my 61 with early 64 gearing, 205 
75 R15 tires, and 1600 sp engine at 3000 rpms.  

If you feel your bus revs out at a low speed, you might think about getting 
taller tires, or even switching to 15&quot; bus rims if you have 14&quot;s.

&gt; My PO told me that he had removed the RGBs from my 58 bus.  Not true.  

Are you sure? he might have put them back in :)

&gt; They are still there.  What are the pros and cons to having them?
&gt; How much of a pain is it to remove them?

Pro. you get a faster wheel speed since the final output of the
transaxle isn't being reduced. but less torque at that wheel.

pro/con depending on what you like, it lowers the bus for that slammed
look. 

con. I like torque.

pro/con w/ some kits you can actually use an irs kit and get rid of the
RGB and go w/ some of the later transmissions. 

not my con, but I love this one:
I was chit-chatting w/ a vw guy recently displaced from Cal to here in
TN. we were looking at my bus and talking RGB's. He stated that he
hated the darn things. I asked him why. One problem was that it
limited speed since those boxes were only designed to turn so fast
(this I can believe). The other problem that I sure didn't agree with
is he complained that if on the road a RGB went out they weren't
readily available. Yea, and a swing axle tranny are just laying around
on the road for the picking. RGB's are solid things. w/ proper upkeep
they won't die any more than any other major component on the bus.
