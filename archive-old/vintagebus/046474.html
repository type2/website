&lt;&lt; This wasn't my post, but I just fixed a rdx box leak and then got a rear 
axle seal leak. So I replaced the rear axle seal, and now...no more leaks! 
Woohoo! Before I replaced the rear axle seal, I drained everything (tranny 
and both rdx boxes), except for the one rearmost tranny plug, which was 
stripped (the part where the big &quot;allen&quot; wrench goes in). I just left that 
one because the wrench would just spin in the drain plug. Anyway, the tranny 
is old, and I figure it's not going to last me forever, but at least I got 
most of the oil out. So then I filled it. I first filled the rdx boxes, but 
not totally full because I had read about the 0.53 pints and it seemed like a 
lot more than that was going in (hard to tell from a gallon jug). Then I 
filled the tranny, let it sit a bit, filled it again, let it sit, etc, until 
it wouldn't take anymore. Nothing is leaking out....woohoo!&gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
Congtrats, on your double repair!  You really should remove that plug.  It is 
the only way to drain the about last half of oil in the R&amp;P area!!  Unless 
you flip you bus n it's side to drain it through the reduction gear box.
 
&lt;&lt;So my question is: 
 Should I go back and top off the rdx boxes? Should they be full to bottom of 
the fill-plug threads? I didn't go that far for fear that too much oil might 
blow a seal or something, but then I did top off the tranny, so is everything 
full? Or should I go and fill the rdx boxes completely, then finish with the 
tranny? Sorry, I guess my main question is: does the specified 0.53 pints 
mean filling the rdx boxes until they are totally full (to the top of the 
hole) or does it mean only 0.53 pints and no more! I've know you can overfill 
the engine, so does that apply to the tranny/rdx box system also?        
Thanks,   -Wilder&gt;&gt;
We just ansewered almost all these questions to Virge and just posted them to 
the list.  If you filled the center section several times till the oil would 
not go below the fill opening on flat ground then everything should be fine 
and full.  If you are not sure just check the fullness of the center section 
again after it has sat for at least a couple of hours again on flat ground.

&lt;&lt;ps - BTW, I received my Bentley manual in the mail yesterday!  I can't 
believe I've had this bus for 10 years without it. It is awesome!&gt;&gt;
Exactly why we believe it is a must for the 1955-67 bus owner!  Try not to 
strain yourself by reading to much at a time!  %^)
