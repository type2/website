&lt;&lt; I've seen mention on the list about heads with more metal around the plug 
holes to help prevent the ol' DP crack problem.  I've been able to find 
reference to a part number (CB 041) and that these are Brazilian, but not 
really how to obtain a pair in case the builder doesn't know. &gt;&gt;

Hi Andrew,
Best to have it converted to SP!  Alot more reliable and easier to work on.  
If not then do go with the 041s.  Either way you might want to buy them from 
Bear's VW Machine Shop in San Diego and have them install thicker stemed 
exhaust valves which helps to prevent the heads of these valves from snapping 
off due to high engine temps.   Eric&amp;Barb
