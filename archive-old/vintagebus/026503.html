Subject: found early single cab!

I found a 1955 single cab (non-barndoor) today. It is perched precariously
on top of some other junk vehicles at a junkyard in the Sacramento area. The
owner, and elderly gentleman said that whoever gets it off of the pile can
have it, in exchange for a 12-pack. He said there is another guy interested
in it too...Tom? Anyway, I have no space for it, so if anyone is interested,
let me know. It is pretty complete, the engine and tranny are out, but do
come with it. It would take some work to get it to off and on to a trailer,
but probably worth the day's effort.

As for the $1300 Telefunken on ebay...whew! tom that is a lot to pay! If you
are going to pay for it and get it...you do have 4 negative feedbacks for
not paying.....;)
