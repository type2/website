Hi all,

We've been very busy around the Bowman household getting ready for all our
friends who will be joining us next weekend for &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The
Arch #16&quot; up on Mark Twain Lake (near Hannibal, Missouri).  Everything
looks great so far, the campground is all ours, and the rangers tell me
it's ready for the party!  I've pretty much completed some long neglected
maintenance and repairs on my '67 Westy (thanks again Ronnie for the parts
and great advice), and the '87 Westy is rarin' to go also.  Some door
prizes have already arrived with a few more on the way, and as usual, if
you're coming and have something you want to donate as a door prize
(preferably VW related), pack it into your Bus and bring it along.  Someone
will appreciate winning it!

I was wondering if one of the many listees who will be in attendance might
want to co-ordinate a Vintagebus / Type 2 &quot;listee photo shoot&quot; with their
digital camera(s) and eventually post it somewhere for all to check out. 
Good idea?  Bad idea?  Might be fun!

Talk amongst yourselves, and if someone wants to do it, contact me and
we'll pick a day/time, announce it,  and get it done!

I wonder who will win the '50-'67 (MUST USE REDUCTION BOXES!) longest
distance driven award?  

Weary but excited to see you all again soon,

Bill Bowman
NEATO
