Subject: Re: [VB] Hare-brained heater scheme???

Hey, nothing wrong with a little thinking, but there are a couple
considerations you may have overlooked.

1.  Your 6volt South Wind can be converted to 12 by connecting the ground of
one motor to the power of the other, putting the motors in series.

2.  A gasoline heater requires air for combustion and you should use an
outside source so you don't have worry about taking air from inside the bus,
which means a vent to the outside.  The SW heaters used a rubber hose to get
outside air.

3.  You need to vent the exhaust outside towards the outer edge of the bus.
The exhaust is around 1 1/4&quot; which is bigger than the icebox drain hole I
believe.

4.  If you've replaced your fuel lines and put fresh seals in the burner and
fuel pump, you won't have any worries about fuel leaks.

&gt; Me again, different subject. When it rains, I have too much time on my hands
&gt; to think about bus projects. I would like everyone's opinion on a set-up I
&gt; have envisioned for putting a gas heater in my westy.   Here's the idea: I
&gt; have removed my sink\icebox to make more room for the kids and the dog.  This
&gt; leaves the hole in the floor where the drain exits open.  I have gotten a line
&gt; on a couple of 6V South Wind gas heaters and my tentative plan is to make a
&gt; self-contained heating system. Basically I would build a &quot;box&quot; that contained
&gt; the heater unit, a 6 volt (or 12 depending on the heater) battery, and
&gt; possibly even an independent small gas holding tank.  The box would be vented
&gt; on both ends to allow for heat circulation and re-circulation,  Sitting in the
&gt; spot where the icebox was and exhausting through the hole in the floor where
&gt; the drain was (i.e. NO CUTTING OF ANY METAL).  The box would have a seat
&gt; cushion on top to be used as an extra seat and could be easily removed fr!
&gt; om!
&gt; the bus during warm weather or switched into another bus, depending on which
&gt; one I wanted to drive that day.  Sounds crazy right? Other variations on the
&gt; idea may include tapping into the existing fuel supply of the bus or moving
&gt; the independent heater fuel container to under the bus near the sliding door.
&gt; If I use a 12 volt heater, I would probably just tap into the bus' electrical
&gt; for power, but it looks like I will have only 6 volt heaters, in which case
&gt; the 6 volt battery would have to be pulled out and re-charged as needed. This
&gt; system would also get the hot heater stuff away from the fuel tank and engine.
&gt; A gas heater mis-hap or fire would only have the small tank of gas (maybe
&gt; about 1 gallon) to burn instead of the 15 gallons in the big fuel tank. A gas
&gt; leak from the heater would not spray an unlimited supply of gas into the hot
&gt; engine compartment.
&gt; I, know, I know, this probably sounds stupid! Why not just put in a BN4 like
&gt; intended? But I really like the idea of not cutting metal, having a &quot;portable&quot;
&gt; heat source that can be easily moved from one place to another, and the
&gt; creativity of it all intrigues me!  So what do you guys think? Is it do-able?
&gt; What considerations have I not thought of?  Rick Taylor, you retro-fit alot of
&gt; these old heaters in buses, right? Can you add anything for me to think about
&gt; id I decide to do this?  P.S.  It's OK to tell me that I am nuts, I can take
&gt; it!!
