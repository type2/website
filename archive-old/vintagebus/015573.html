There is a similar thread on the 911 list right now, comparing the
aftermarket auto part industry to the aftermarket aircraft part
industry.

Basically, the auto aftermarket doesn't have to answer to anybody -
in a lot of cases, (from my own personal experience with a vendor
who makes some of the stuff discussed on this here list) not even the customer.
It's a whole different world inthe aircraft industry.  And conversely,
you don't have people asking &quot;Are XYZ's turbo bifurcators any good&quot; - you
know they are, or they wouldn't be sold.  I'm sure there are isolated
cases of failures, but nothing even close to the automotive world.
Then again, in most cases, when a car part fails, you don't die (most
cases, anyway...)
