We take &quot;commercial&quot; stuff on a case-by-case basis.  For instance, if you
have some NOS widgets and put them on ebay and tell the list, that's OK.
If you feel the need to re-inform the list of that auction several times,
that's not, and you'll quietly disappear from the list.

The finer line is with the &quot;real&quot; commercial vendors, ie, the ones with
real shops.  So far, none of them have crossed it.  Posting a &quot;we sell that
piece&quot; when a question comes up about a particular widget is fine.  

What *isn't* fine are completely off-topic posts about laser printers or
surf-for-money schemes, and &quot;little jimmy has terminal rust of the colon
and wants to receive 1 million emails  before he goes tot he junkyard in
the sky&quot; stuff.

If you cross the line, you'll know.  You can bank on that one! :)

&gt;Somewhere there is a line and thankfully the commercial oriented list members
&gt;rarely cross it and the advertising is almost always just right on this list.
&gt;IMHO
