Harry Pellow is an interesting fellow, I actually met him at one of the
Porsche swap meets.  Really knows his stuff on the early engines, and really
puts out some beautiful work.  I wonder if he could be persuaded to build

&gt; Anyways, a really good reference for California license plates is in &quot;Secrets 
&gt; of the Inner Circle&quot; by the Maestro (a Porsche engine builder).  The book is 
&gt; about 356 Porsches, but is very entertaining.
