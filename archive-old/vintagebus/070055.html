  If you can find someone with a crank dowel hole jig you can do it
yourself. These are the jigs used for 8 doweling a crank and flywheel. It is
easy and can be done fairly quick. 
  The problem is when the crank holes oblonged they flair the crank flange
thus the crank might not sit flush, nothing a file couldn't fix.
  I did this back in the 70's in my rail in Mexico. Pulled the engine and
Jose's VW, wash machine, tortilla factory and blender repair had it drilled
and back together in less then 1/2 hour, total cost was a case of MODELA
beer.

ronnie

ps. I did get an engine in here where they just used a drill and freehanded
4 new holes through the flywheel and into the crank. They used cut off
pieces of the drill bit shank for dowels, lasted till they blew the engine
after a couple years

pps. if pulling the puck I would high recomend a 8 dowel crank and flywheel
in the future

&gt; Otherwise we are looking for a high end stock SP motor with universal 
&gt; case (needs mustache bar attachment) for the b*y.

May have found one but owner has no idea if a universal or not.  He was 
not looking at the engine but he had a case number - B615070 - 
supposedly new.

Anyone know what kind of case this is??  Universal? Dual relief?

Thanks P &amp; C
