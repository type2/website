&gt; Hi Volks- a friend of mine is rebuilding fuel sending units for air-cooled

Ohms.
&gt; Does anyone know if the resistance of n-c wire is the same for 30 ga? Any
&gt; help will be GREATLY appreciated. Please PM  TBear- the cherry guy

Ted,

I think you might have better luck locating .0018&quot; nichrome, although
you would  be looking at 675/1.8^2 ~= 208 ohms/foot for nichrome C.

I was shopping at my friendly local university surplus store a couple
months ago and bought a box of mixed wire that had come from a lab in
EE.  Most of it was magnet wire and some .005&quot; tantalum, but there
were a couple spools of really fine, shiny stuff.  I stuck them in a
drawer and forgot about them until your post.

I mic'ed them both, one spool is .0018 and the other is .0009&quot;!
Pretty fine stuff.  I measured 134 ohms/foot for the .0018, which is
closest to 304 stainless on the wire chart (although it's strongly
magnetic, so maybe not 304).   I've got probably 100'+, so if you want
some mystery wire pmail me :)
