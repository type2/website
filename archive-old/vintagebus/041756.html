&gt; the drivetrain.  Does the reverse compression braking practice (again...I am
&gt; merely going 50-55 in 4th) cause undo strain?  I tend to lay off the
&gt; brakes....I see the over-use of brakes as a sign of weakness, or
&gt; something.....should I use more brake to fend off damage to that which makes

Well, brakes are a lot easier to fix than drivetrains!

However, if you are doing a lot of braking in the mountains, do you really
want your brakes to fade out?  If not, then you should use your
drivetrains to do the job.  They're much better at getting rid of the
deceleration heat!
