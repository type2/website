&gt; In 1968-71 bus the place that the heater cable hooked to the the heater
&gt; box valve to turn on and off the heat was moved farther upwards by
&gt; removing the earlier lower linkage.  These later bus heater boxes will
only
&gt; work if you wire the valves open to get heat all the time.


Speaking of which, I have a handful of N.O.S. original GERMAN Volkswagen
heat exchangers of the above description.  As Eric &amp; Barb noted, these will
fit any fresh-air-heat bus, but the linkage will be slightly different from
that used on a Splitty.  One solution is to simply wire the box open as
noted above, although I have also heard of people spot-welding a bug or
universal style linkage onto these to make them work with the dash control
on a Splitty.

Why bother?  These are incredibly heavy duty compared to the Danish ones
sold today.  They were a lucky N.O.S. find which I very possibly will not
come across again.  Compared to a new Danish box or a rusty used one, these
will deliver much more heat and last much longer, with the above limitation.
If you are on the Type 2 ('68-79) list you have seen glowing reports of
these heat exchangers from list members who bought them.

Price is $189.95/pair, or $99.95 for left only (I have more lefts than
rights).  I only have 6 complete pair left.  To the best of my knowledge,
there will be no more right side units when these pairs are gone (my
supplier in Germany is sold out).  They are on the website, or you can call
or p-mail me.
