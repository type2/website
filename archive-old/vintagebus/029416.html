I saw Lenny Copp at the SOTO meet in August.  He said he had some made and
claimed they looked really nice.  Seeing the stuff that comes from Lenny, I
would have to believe him.  Maybe these are his?

Lenny said that they were incredibly expensive to make and he's selling them
at $800 for the set.  He mentioned that they were quite thick, but didn't say
how thick.

&gt; Anyway,  I have a friend who picked uo a set of

&gt; him to find out where he actually got the things...
&gt; his connections are obviously 'heavier' than mine).

&gt; Note these are the underfloor pans for DD and
&gt; sunroof models we are talking about here.
