Hi all,

I've been doing various things to my '59 panel these last
couple of months. I bought some replacement wheel wells
(mine were cut out by a previous owner) and have installed
one so far, it looks much better on that side.  I did the
front brakes, shoes, wheel cylinders, hoses, stops great now.
Bought a cab divider off the internet and installed it,
the cab it a bit quieter now. (thanks DuvBlauDKB!)

Now, I'm looking at the exhaust.  There is a 4 into 1
extractor on there and I thought I'd put on a stock
exhaust.  I haven't been able to find a new 36hp
stock exhaust for less than $175.  Does anyone know
a less expensive alternative that is reasonably good quality?

Also, there are two exhaust leaks on each side, the joint
between the extractor and the pipes that come back from the
#1 and #3 cylinders have no clamps and are just a loose sliding
fit and the #1/#3 pipes themselves leak where those pipes
change diameter about halfway back to the extractor.  I
noticed in the Wolfsburg West catalogue that they have
special repair pipe sections for this application so this
must not be an uncommon failure point.

These exhaust leaks probably aren't causing any harm or if
they are, the damage has been done long ago.  However, they
make the exhaust louder and, since I'd like to keep the exhaust
as quiet as possible, I figured I'd try fixing them temporarily.
Last night I bought eight 3/4&quot; to 1 3/4&quot; hose clamps, got
out my high temperature (no asbestos) gasket material, and
made a quick fix by wrapping the leaking joints with the
gasket material and putting a hose clamp before and after
each joint to hold the gasket material tightly in place.
This works quite well and the exhaust is quieter and the
engine seems to run more smoothly.  However, the gasket
material smells bad when it gets hot and I don't think this
fix will last very long.  Can anyone recommend a better
material to use instead of high temp gasket material?
Something with asbestos would probably be best but I don't
know if asbestos materials are for sale these days.

Eventually, I'll put on a new, stock, exhaust and fix the
#1/#3 pipes with the repair sections.  But for now, I just
want a good patch. (eventually, I'll rebuild the engine too
because it has 20 thousandths end play, but, for now, it
runs great and is fun to drive.)

thanks,
