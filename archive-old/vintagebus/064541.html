Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height Question

Thom,
Mine needed to settle down ALOT after the unlowering. I was worried the
rear was set way too high, then it settled down to correct. Front I
cannot enter experience, as mine was done with spindles.
If the front specs right, and the rear doesn't, could be the torsion
bars are too tired for correct spec to hold ride height. Either fudge or
new bars I guess.

Shocks might help by adding the required squish dampening on the
downstroke to return to a happier setting, but I doubt that will get the
bus higher in the rear?

Try getting 2 or three people up front to squish front down, the spec
it.....
Hope that helps,
Al



&gt; The only thing I can think of is that I need to give the
&gt; new front springs time to 'settle'.  I can't think of any 
&gt; other reason for the high front end/low back end.
&gt; 
&gt; Any other ideas?
