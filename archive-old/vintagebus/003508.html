Subject: Re: [VB] That rattle - was this it?

Thom,

I also have an irritating rattle, comes and goes with engine vibration (not
necessarily speed). When I put pressure on the shifter (push it further into
the gear it is in), the rattle subsides. I think it's the shift rod, perhaps
the ball and socket at the bottom of the stick. One of these days I'm going
to try adjusting the position of the shifter on the floorboard to see if I
can quiet it down.

&gt; Some of you may recall the strange rattle I had at speed in my 60 panel.
&gt; (and some of you have even heard it, but not the cam rattle - that *is*
&gt; fixed)  It was an annoying rattle that came up thru the shifter.
