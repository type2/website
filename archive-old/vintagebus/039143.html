My 59 has had a radio installed in it sometime in the past. Fortunately the
dash opening was not cut, but the holes for the knobs have been enlarged to
1/2&quot;. My other bus had a block off plate and had smaller 5/16&quot; holes. My
question is I would like to install a period correct radio, did you have to
enlarge the holes to install a Sapphire I radio or other early radios? Also,
was there one brand radio that would have been more commonly installed by US
dealers in early 1959.


Thanks,
Paul
