Hi Thom,
Duh!  Thanks for the recorrection.  We were worried about volks trying to 
have the mirror head chromed which is a tricky 50% option.  Chrome on 
aluminum is just too dissimular and just as often as not the chrome will peel 
off of the aluminum all by itself very soon after.  Thus the reason VW used a 
plating method that was totally differant from chrome for all of the aluminum 
trim parts.  Saw in Hot VWs quite a few years ago that there was a shop in CA 
that was using this same process to redo the bus beauty trim rings back to 
thier original glory.    Eric&amp;Barb
