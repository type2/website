OK, I've bit my tongue so far...
What I think is really crazy is that my '54 barndoor
is still for sale. It needs to be sold.

Several versions of a response to this thread have
been written rewritten and deleted prior to sending.
Even this one has been heavily edited. I will err on
the side of silence on this one.
I choose not to pass judgement on other people's
vehicles or their prices. It's easy to pass judgement
on other folks rides especially if you aren't in the
market. I hate all of this snippiness. Hooray for
everyone and thier favorite vehicle in whatever shape
it's in. Drive it and enjoy it.

All I know is that I have a great bus that is for
sale. 
&quot;Make Offer&quot; means just that. You might get a bargain
if you are real. Step up or get back on the porch.
