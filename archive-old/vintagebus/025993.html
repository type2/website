Subject: VW Planet busted + thanks + BD update

Just a Friday note to say my web site is busted right now, it's been slow for a day or so as well. I'm at the mercy of the people who run the machines to fix it, they say it should be fixed in a few hours... 

On another note, a public thanks to Karl who sent me a spare tire strap for free! I've noticed an awesome response lately to the couple questions I've posted, so thanks to all who took the time to respond, I appreciate it. 

In &quot;Everett's Kombi&quot; news, I was bored last weekend so I hand painted a VW Planet logo on my Bus, I'll post a picture when I can. I haven't done much recently, a lot of little stuff, I: 
o Rebuilt and installed the &quot;correct&quot; 54-55 36hp fuel pump 
o Installed a &quot;correct&quot; battery positive cable to replace my garden hose-wrapped zero gauge POS. 
o Repainted the fuel tank and spare tire tray black and installed the &quot;correct&quot; Barndoor fuel tap. 
o Someone offered me a nice Barndoor rear reflector, unfortunately the stud on the back broke off so I disassembled one of my busted glass ones and swapped the rears. 
o Attempted to improve the quality of my front seat by installing some couch-style springs over my busted original springs, it actually worked pretty well but anybody got a '54-'55 Barndoor lower front bench seat? I had one that I considered sold to me for the past 5 months but the guy changed his mind, I hate that.  
o Installed some nicer ribbed-bumper splash pans I picked up at Pomona a while back.  Rear bumper is nice and tight now. 

Have a good weekend.
