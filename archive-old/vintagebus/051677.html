Subject: Re: [VB] Rear main seal replacement??

Hi Rich,
We concur with Joel about the cooler or it's seals being the culprit.  If the 
fan shroud was manhandled badly when the engine was put back in the damage 
could have been done.  Even the cast ears that mount the cooler could have 
been broken.  Good thing you caught the leak before it got too low.  By the 
time the idiot oil pressure light comes on it is usually too late for the 
bearings.

PS Joel make sure to apply a slight amount to the stiker plate to reduce wear 
and easier closing the door!  Which results in less stress on the body/door 
components.  Eric&amp;Barb
