Here's what I know about it.  My 58' and 59' don't have the crescent, but my
60' did.  For been only used for 4 years I seem to have quite a few in the
door pile.  Just wondering if the half moon has a purpose or if it' was just
for pretty (which is very unvolkswagenish)
  Peace, Love, and maybe it's a water trough to keep the door handle dry..LOL
