I was approached at the OCTO meet last year and asked if my rustybus was available for a commercial for a Japanese auto maker.  The description he gave me is almost identical to the description below.  I can't wait to see which bus they ended up using.

I was also asked about using my bus in a CD Now commercial.  They ended up using a restored yellow bus (if it was the same commercial I saw), rather than a 'hippie bus' that they originally had described.

In other Friday news, I heard on the radio this morning that the TV ads for
the new Honda Insight (hybrid gas/electric car) will feature a Type 2 with
lots of environmentally oriented bumper stickers.  Should be interesting.
