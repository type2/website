I have just finished my 66 13 widow deluxe. It had it's first day at work
Wednesday.
 I have been driving it to do Pasta delivery's and noticed some gear oil
leaking out from the passengers side rear wheel (spinning out from the hub
cap). I'm pulling the drums this weekend to do the brakes what are the
chances Iv'e just got a broken seal and maybe a bad outer bearing ?
