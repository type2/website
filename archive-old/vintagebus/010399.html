Subject: Simple minds, simple projects.

This evening in 2 hours I made a simple little deck or table to put in my
bus for the trip to Colorado.  I depart in a week.  On the way out, I'll
have one or maybe 2 passengers but on the return I will have a bonified 4.
The idea is that we can store stuff under the deck, prop our feet on it
while sitting in the back seat, throw stuff on top of it, set drinks or maps
on it, and even sleep in rotating shifts on the return.  As I'm the largest
of all who are going with me, I'll be forced to sleep in the roof rack or
something like that but the rest of the crew shouldn't have any trouble
sleeping back there.  I can sleep about anywhere though.

Anyway, see my sawdust and tool pile at:

And see the scrap lumber deck (as in didn't cost me a dime) at:

BTW:  Dan and Jamie - this is for you guys! :-)

Drink holders to be added later. :-)
