I've been told US dealers would chrome the bumpers on occasion, usually only for Deluxe models, as an &quot;add-on&quot; or as a justification for the additional price of a Deluxe.

My ex-'54 Single Cab had what was supposedly an original chrome front ribbed bumper (non-Barndoor).  It was removed from a Deluxe by the PO.  Details were a bit shady.

One of my friends has a chrome front Barndoor ribbed front bumper, picked it up at a show for $75.  I do not think that one is original.

&gt; Chrome Ribbed bumpers ? Not original surely.
&gt; American market only ?...............
&gt; If so I've learnt something new today.
