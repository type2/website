&gt;&gt; hey...any lawyers on one of these fine lists want to help a fellow
&gt;&gt; busser out?  It would be greatly appreciated.......if there are any of
&gt;&gt; you out there ;-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Hah! Thats a laugh. Lawyers in buses?
&gt;A lawyer would most likely spontaneously combust in a karma-rich
&gt;environment like a split screen vw. 

I take umbrage at that! As a lawyer and the owner of two splitties, one 
beetle, and a Karmann Ghia, this comes perilously close to slander, and I 
will take the appropriate action! :)

Seriously, Isaih, p-mail and maybe I can help you out!

Chris
