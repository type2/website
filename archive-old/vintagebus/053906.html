Subject: broken cam? wtb engine

I have been lurking for a few weeks since the Buses and Punkin Chunkin
in the first state. Let me fill everyone in on my last two weeks. On my way
to Punkin Chunkin
My pressure plate gave out. I drove it like that for a week. I finally pull
the engine and install a pressure
plate that I had pulled from a bus about 6 months earlier. Upon reinstalling
the engine. I fired it up and
thought that the engine sounded different.(kinda too valvey)Is that a word?
On my way to work yesterday my
bus just stopped. I had put a new fuel pump on two days before and thought
that it must be bad. It`s 2:00 am and
I didn`t feel like messing with it so I flagged a coworker down and he gave
me a lift. I checked it out when
I got off and had fuel and fire but no start. I thought wow the motor is
sure turning over fast. So I check and no valve are moving when I crank it.
I towed home and pulled it out. I haven`t torn it apart yet. I did drain the
oil and it looks like there is some silver in it. I guess that was the noise
I was hearing. Anybody ever break a cam? Anybody have a motor for sale?
I am located in Delaware.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
