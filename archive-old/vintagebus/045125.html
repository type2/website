Subject: Barndoor windshield wipers?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I was recently given a set of NOS bus wiper blades and partial arms (just the
metal shaft, no pivot attachment) and the blades are longer and the arms are
thinner than the originals that I have.  Arm contour is identical, just
smaller guage.  The blades have 3 ply rubber rather than the formed rubber you
see nowadays.. These are supposedly NOS, what are they for?  Are these for an
earlier bus, maybe barndoor?
Thanks,
Dan Morris
