&gt; VW seem to use up the old parts before starting in

&gt; I have a very early '64 model year with 15&quot; rims
&gt; which I believe to be
&gt; original, even though one would assume a '64 had
&gt; 14&quot;.
&gt; 

And other early characteristics would be the early
door handles on your bus, and the early cab heating
tube.
