I already have some of those pix, scanned from the book &quot;VW BUS, 1949-1967&quot;
although these scans are better.  Whoever buys it can scan them for me :)

&gt;Hey everyone - this is a really neat little book that is for sale on Ebay.
&gt;It's gonna bring several hundred bucks but the pictures that this guy
&gt;scanned in are worth looking at.  It shows all the old features of the first
&gt;buses - like the spare tire in the engine bay!  I saved all 4 pictures the
&gt;guy scanned in because they are all neat.  I think they'd be worthy enough
&gt;to put on www.vintagebus_dot_com!
