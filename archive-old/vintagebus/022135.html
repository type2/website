CHUCKY'S REDNECK CAMP #003
JULY 10 &amp; 11
TRIPLE CREEK CAMPGROUND  COSBY, TN

A VW Camp out with a twist --

Free Food, Free Entertainment, Free Dash Plaques for the first 50, Event
Shirts, Redneck King &amp; Queen Awards, Chili Cook off, Redneck 500, Buddy
McDonald Memorial Bike Rally, Midnight Beer belly Contest --

This is not a camp for recovering rednecks nor is it a camp providing
instruction on becoming one.  This is a VW campout for those who just want
to be one for the weekend. We dress redneck, talk redneck, tell redneck
jokes, play redneck games and have a ball doing it.  This is a
family gathering so we don't really use the entire redneck vocabulary.


CAMPGROUND: Sites are creek side with water &amp; electric - $15.  Great tent
sites also.  Playground for children and lots of room for bicycles.

FREE BUFFETS: Provided by Chef Chucke' and Chef Jere'.  You're welcome to
bring a side dish but it's not required.

CHILI COOK OFF: Provide 2 quarts of your best chili for judging (the judge
gets one spoonful, the rednecks eat the rest).  Winner gets a weekend for 2
at Chestnut Ridge Cabins near Dollywood.

REDNECK KING &amp; QUEEN: Decided Saturday evening by the rest of us rednecks.

BIKE RALLY: Mountain Bike type course laid out within the campground. 
Winner awarded a plaque provided by Buddy McDonald.

REDNECK 500: You've got to be there.

BEER BELLY CONTEST: Men parade before the ladies who will, after a pose
down, decide the winner.
