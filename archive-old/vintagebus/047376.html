I used the polish I use to polish small shiny things, or things I want shiny. 
 Forget the brand.   Then used car wax, turtle wax I think it is, in thegreen 
tin comes with a sponge.    Did not buy either specificlly for window 
purposes.   Helps the wipers smoothly screet the water off the glass.  Time 
to do it again.. :)
