&gt;The amount exerted to the nut will always be &quot;less the amount used
&gt;to deflect the shaft around it's axis&quot; . . .

According to whom?  I would love this to be true, as it is a recipe for a 
perpetual motion machine and a solution to all the world's energy 
problems; but alas, that damn nuisance 1st law of thermodynamics won't 
allow it... 

Mike (and others), you are confusing deflection and torque.   You are 
quite correct that the longer the extension, the greater the angular 
deflection, but the torque will be uniform through-out.  

Regards,

Tom
