&lt;&lt; Wasn't sure if it was brake fluid from a faulty wheel cylinder or a gear 
oil leak...pretty sure its the later.  I  tightened the bolts on him the last 
time I fed the tranny Staylube but he still leaks...I'm not even sure if its 
leaking form the split in the GRB case.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
If yoiu are using Sta-Lube tranny oil it will smell of sulfur.  If it is 
brake fluid it will have a light smell kind of like pineapple.  Hopefully 
when you are adding Sta-Lube into a tranny that you know had the same tranny 
oil in it.  Using differant brands and/or wieghts of oil in the tranny and 
engine is a dangerous thing to do!  So if in doubt drain and fill with what 
you are going to use.  Eric&amp;Barb
