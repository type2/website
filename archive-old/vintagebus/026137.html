I've been told by not a few people that a 009 distributor with a 34pict3 carb
is not exactly a match made in heaven.  I used to have all kinds of problems,
then I just got fed up and went and bought a stock vacuum distributor.  Now I
just make sure my automatic choke is adjusted properly and I have no problems
with idle or hesitation.  I also tend to take it easier now on my bus...
