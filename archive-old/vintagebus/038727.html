i am considering having the rest of the body and welding work done on my
dormobile this spring. i'm thinking of going to this guy that did my
friend's cadillac. he uses only metal, not body filler. he did my friends
huge 69 caddy for $2200 including tearing everything down and stripping it
to bare metal and repainting it. it looks and feels great! he said something
that puzzled me, though. he said that this guy doesn't weld, he presses. i
guess i don't know what pressing is. my friend said that it was better than
welding what do you guys think. what is the process in pressing? also, how
many coats of primer/paint should i have done for a really glossy, almost
new car paint job?
thanks a lot!
