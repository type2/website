&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; That would work from what we have been told for the 66-67 model buses that 
&gt; have simular nine prong signal relay box wiring to the 1968-70ish buses.  
&gt; What year bus does he have this system in?  Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
Yes, 

He has it in 1966... as a replacement for that awful &quot;black box&quot;

Come to think of it, it may not work in 62-65 busses, i had never
stopped to really consider it as i have a 61 with no e flashers at all..
and a 66 &quot;someday&quot; project.

take care,

Steve
