Subject: Re: Battery hold down

Hi All - previously:

-------------------
 &gt; I was curious as to how some of y'all may be holding down your battery?

I use the wood-spacer method, too.  If you don't like the way that
looks/acts, maybe a block underneath painted black?  I'd be interested in
hearing other solutions, too.
----------------------

I've used a plastique battery box for many years in my '71 - available at 
Sears, etc.

The version I found has a top that allows for the cables to emerge and 
which is held down to the body of the box with a plastic cinch strap.  I 
installed U bolt hold downs into the sheet metal of the bus and use a 
separate strap to hold the box securely.

By using a box, with it's 'mini environment' for the battery, I've noticed 
less corrosion at the battery post connections and for sure less battery 
fluid loss through time.  I've also switched to quick connect battery cable 
ends - all of which makes it an easier job to haul the battery out for real 
service.

Nick
