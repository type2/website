&lt;&lt;  Alright... heres the deal..
  brand new mexican motor...won't idle... it'll rev just fine...but will
  not idle....it will idle high IF the stepped choke cam is not fully in
  the &quot;on&quot; position.  If the choke is FULLY open...it will not idle...
  even with the throttle arm all the way down.  If I pump the gas...it
  will rev though... &gt;&gt;

 Don't know where you are located but when I moved back here to Colorado 
Springs(6500 ft above sea level) I had quite a bit of tuning problems 
concerning the 34 pict3 carb. The biggest problem was also stalling at idle. 
I found the 80 air correction jet was way to small for the altitude &amp; thin 
air. I went up to a 125 air correction. This itself cured that problem, 
though I'm still not sure its the correct size yet. I've also dropped the 
main jet size from 127.5 to a 120 and believe I still may drop a size or two. 
I've also used a 30/31 with slightly better results. The only problem I'm 
still having with both is hard starting after the engine is warm, still 
working on that one.
