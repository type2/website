Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

Speaking of scoops to help with cooling, I found something that works great
for my bus.

If I run ALL the cooling tin, with the exception of the very front piece
(flywheel end of the engine), my engine temps drop conciderably. One lame
test I did, was with the engine held at 3500 rpm (1600DP in a 64 bus), and
engine lid closed, the fan would pull a shop towel to the side vents from a
foot away. We're talking a 90 degree pull. Without the front tin in place,
and the engine held at 3500 rpm again, I would have to hold the shop towel
within a few inches before it would pull on the shop towel.

The difference in driving on the freeway was HUGE. Before, my temps would
get too hot within 7 miles driving 3500 rpm on the freeway. Without the tin,
the engine never ran hot again, even being held at 4000 rpm for hours at a
time driving between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas each week for work. Fully
loaded or not, cooling was no longer an issue.

I was worried about the engine recirculating hot air if I were stopped at a
light, or in stop and go traffic on a hot day, but had no problems with this
arrangement, even driving around in the middle of summer while in Las Vegas
last year (over 100 degree temps). With all the stock cooling tin in place,
all the hot air is directed out the back of the bus. I did attatch a hose to
the doghouse cooler to direct the hot air from that out the back as well.

So if you have a problem with running hot on the highway, but not while
driving around town, try this simple mod (but only if you have all the rest
of the cooling tin in place!), and I'll bet your cooling issues will be
solved.

No side scoops needed.  :-)

&gt; &gt; I would argue that while the later busses do have a &quot;scoop&quot; to the

&gt; &gt; scoops. If I remember correctly the actual vent area is not all that
&gt; &gt; different from a split in terms of area and they may have been
&gt; &gt; &quot;scooped&quot; more because they are on a rounded part of the body and in
&gt; &gt; a different (higher) location.
&gt;
&gt; I should revise my statement based on this and other counter points.
&gt;
&gt; We cannot say the scoops don't work well because VW didn't put them on
&gt; busses. A later design (read bay window) included a style of scoop
&gt; that may be a result of a design improvement, a necessary change to
&gt; satisfy the relocation of the fresh air vents or an astetic choice.
&gt; The only way to say if this scoop design works on split windows is to
&gt; test &amp; verify.
&gt;
&gt; That being said, I sure don't like the look, but might think it funny
&gt; to see one that looked like jet engines. You know kinda a swamp cooler
&gt; type housing on a pylon :)
