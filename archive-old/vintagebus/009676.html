Steven Howell wrote to remind us of the importance of the top bolt which
doubles as a starter/engine/trans fastener.
You're right Steve, and John Muir points to that in his book also. That
could have been part of my problem after the first install. My 14 yr old son
and I have that upper bolt procedure down cold. When I first read the
instructions in Muir's book I thought &quot;No way can I do this&quot;. Now, after
half a dozen R&amp;R's on the starter we're down to about five minutes start to
finish. I think that nut deserves the occasional maintenance check in case
it works it's way loose and costs another engine pull. Thanks Steve, you've
answered a couple of my questions, and I appreciate your tips.
