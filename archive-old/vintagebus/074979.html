Subject: RE: [VB] casting flashing/Re: [VB] my new motor - pics

  A funny thing about casting flash. A friend of mine here bought a set of
BERG head$$$$$$ stock mind you though full hemi cut?. I was shocked at the
amount of casting flash in these heads. After a call to BER$$$$$$ they said
they purchase bare heads with the most flash. They believe that the flash
helps dissipate heat better and helps pull more heat out of the heads. The
flash helps swirl the air thus pulling more heat out. As far as blocking air
flow, the pressure from the shroud will still blow as much air through the
heads, with or with-out the flash.
  Mind you this is what BER$$$ says and has anyone ever proved them wrong?

ronnie.  This is just a statement of facts (not my opinion) and by no means
is what I do or do not believe in.

ps. This looks like another cooling test that Jake Raby needs to do as he
did with his fan shroud test on his dyno

When they make the heads, it seems there is a two piece mold they put
together, pour the molten metal in, let it set, and pull the pieces apart.
(then machine bits)  you can see the seam horizontally around the head. 

 Now take a head and look down the fins from top or bottom, some of the
metal oozed out at the seam of the mold, and sticks out a bit.  This is
casting flashing, and it gets in the way of air flow.  Idea is if you clean
it away, the heads will cool better.

So you can take implements of destruction and clean it away.  Drill (with
some different size bits), file, and/or even a rotary power saw.  then be
amazed at the pile of metal shavings you made.  Look at the head and see the
gaps are cleaner and larger.  Just follow the mold lines, and get rid of
that extra metal that oozed out around the seam.  Thanks to Eric of
veewee111 for this tip.  I did it to the heads on the motor that's in my 61,
runs cool.
