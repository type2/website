  Hi everyone!  So this &quot;dodo&quot; who is restoring my 61 Westy takes out the speedo to 
clean etc, and breaks off the needle leaving about a half inch still attached.  I oh,
I mean 'him' wants to use the original gauge.  Has anyone successfully fixed this
sort of thing?  I'm sure there are other 'hims' out there who tend to be all thumbs
like me, ah, him I mean. Any help please!
