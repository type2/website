#####  Assateague is taking reservations now!!!!!!!!#######

_________________________________________________________

So far Ive gotten very little suggestions on the weekend name.  Buses by
the Sea seemed to be the best one so far.  Any other suggestions?


Ok, heres the final results of the date poll for the Assateague campout
in Maryland.

Sept 16 is the set date!!!!!  Many things seemed to factor in this
date...  mainly Heat, Bugs, and the fact that even with 100 people we
should all be able to get camping in the same area. :)

Bob mentioned something about canoeing to me and that got the lights
blinking!!  I called assateague and they have about 20 canoes available
for rent.  $6 hour or $15 for the whole day.   Assateague has a beautiful
bayside to it that is a joy to paddle.  For those interested in planning
a canoe trip either saturday or sunday morning, please let me know.

I'll probably put a website up with all the info in the next few days
and i'll add info to that as it comes to me.

For those planning on attending, Assateague requires a reservation for a
campsite.  Plan on making your reservations as soon as
possible.  I just called today and all group sites have been taken.
Individual drive in sites are $14 and allow 2 vehicles per site or 2
tents.  There are 24 ocean sites left, and 44 bay sites left.  I cant
stress how quickly these might fill up.  Dont delay.  If i could get an
rsvp for those planning on attending we could decide on ocean or bay.
Both areas are nice.  I tend to like the bayside areas better.
Reservations or availability checks can be made online or over the phone
at (800) 365 2267 or
http://reservations.nps_dot_gov/parkResults.cfm?park_id=5&amp;cfid=785384&amp;cftoke
n=80271982  or http://reservations.nps_dot_gov  If you call the phoneline
your using the first 3 digits of ASS.

A few more things.   I need to know who can help with hauling down some
firewood for the bonfire.  My trusty dusty 72 westy is up for the task.
Anyone else willing to haul in their bus?
Also....  Food donations.  who is bringing what?

Last but not least...  I will be there the 15th and the 16th to welcome
anyone who wants to come for the whole weekend. :) Early attendees will
be rewarded with preperation tasks for the saturday party!!  FUN FUN
FUN!!!

PLEASE RSVP ASAP!!!!!



Emmet
