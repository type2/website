Subject: Re: [VB] Snap ring pliers

Curt, and others,

I'm gonna say this and it don't matter how poor you are: when you buy a
tool, you go for the best that you can afford, and Sears Craftsman is near
the top and guaranteed for life. The best you can afford means that you
buy the Craftsman tool, not the Harbor Freight junk. If you have a lot of
money, you buy Craftsman or you go up to Proto or SnapOn, or Allen, etc.

A tool needs to work when you need it - your time and effort depend on
that tool. You buy junk, you end up screwed, and then you have to buy the
good one. There's no excuse not to at least buy Craftsman - and they go on
sale all the time, especially arouind Xmas.

I have always bought Craftsman, Vise-Grip, Allen, S&amp;K, and occasionally
Stanley and Xcelite. In 30 years of toolin' around this ol' bus, I have
broke ONE tool - a 27mm socket, on the tranny carriage bolts - first time
off for 'em, back in 75. Took it back to Sears, no questions asked, less
than two minutes. Back to bus, finished up the work, anti-sieze on that
bolt.

Moral of unnecessarily long rap: You *can* afford at least Craftsman - and
your work will get done correctly every time, and your tool will last
forever. End of tool rant.

&gt; Ditto here this weekend too.  Only I paid 7 bucks more . . . I made the
mistake of buying a set of Taiwanese crap &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; from Harbor Freight
before busting them clean (both pear)  trying to put in the big snap ring
that holds the paddle end of the axle in the side gear.
You live and learn.  Ah Sears Craftsman tools!  Maybe not the BEST, but
darn near it, and easily replacable.
