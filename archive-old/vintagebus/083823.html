&gt; When the bus is cold, it runs like a champ, smooth,
&gt; powerful.  After a few minutes it seems like I'm
&gt; loosing a ground somewhere.

When was the last time you replaced the points and
condenser?  If it's been a while, do that, and try
again.  A completely bad condenser will sometimes keep
the engine from running, but one that's not quite dead
yet can make the engine run poorly.

If that doesn't help, here's what I'd try.  Do all this
in order.

1) Disconnect battery ground strap.  Put it where it can't
   flop back against the body or battery terminal and make
   contact again.

2) Inspect positive cable connection at battery.  If there
   is any doubt, undo the cable, shine up the battery post
   and the inside of the terminal with a wire brush or
   pocket knife.  If the cable is beat, replace it whole.
   You can get a new terminal to put on the end of the
   cable and this works OK to get you to the end of your
   trip or the next paycheck, but replacing the whole
   cable is the best long-term solution.  Consider a 2
   gauge cable, especially if your Bus is 6 V.  You'll
   have to wrestle it around more, but it will work
   better.  Take out or measure your old one first so
   you know what you need - most FLAPS sell battery cables
   with a variety of gauges, terminals, and lengths.

3) Measure battery voltage with a digital voltmeter.  If
   you haven't just been driving the Bus, it should be at
   least 6.30 V or 12.60 V.  A little higher is OK, but
   if it's below maybe 6.15 V or 12.30 V, take the battery
   out of the Bus and put it on a charger.

4) Follow positive cable from battery to grommet in front
   of engine.  Make sure the grommet is there and that the
   wire insulation is not cut or frayed where it goes
   through the body.

5) Your voltage regulator should be right near there.
   Unscrew it from the inner wheel well, and make sure
   all the wires to it are tight.  You might pull off
   each connection in turn and shine it up with a wire
   brush, then reconnect.  When you're done, shine up
   the &quot;feet&quot; of the voltage regulator and the place on
   the body where they mount.  Screw the voltage regulator
   back to the body.

6) At the generator, make sure that both wires are tight
   on their studs - optionally remove, shine, and replace.
   Make sure the mounting strap for the generator is tight.
   The fan belt is reasonably tight, right?

7) At the coil, make sure that the two little wires and
   the one fat wire are clean and tight.  Inspect the
   little one that goes down to the distributor for
   damage.  Also check out the spark plug wires for
   cracks and damage, and make sure all the spark plugs
   are tight.

8) Follow the thin black wire that comes from the coil
   and doesn't go to the distributor.  There may be
   shoots off this wire to the carb - if so, check those
   connections.  Follow the wire all the way to the body,
   making sure it's not damaged.  There should be a
   grommet where the harness goes through the body.

9) Crawl under the car and make sure all connections are
   clean and tight at the starter.  Especially work over
   the stud that has the positive cable from the battery
   on it - this is also the connection for your generator
   to charge the battery.

10) In the cab, make sure the connections are clean and
    tight at the ignition switch.  Remove, shine, replace
    as needed.  Also check all the solid red and solid
    black wires you can find at the fuse box - make sure
    they are tight to the fuse box and each other.  In
    other words, where there are two wires crimped into
    one female push-on, make sure the push-on is tight
    on the wires.

11) Take a last look around to make sure you've reconnected
    everything and that everything electrical is shut off.
    If the battery's on the charger, wait for it to finish,
    then put it back in the Bus and connect up the positive
    cable.  Then shine up both ends of the battery ground
    strap and reconnect it.  If you get a big spark when
    you make the connection, something is drawing current
    even when the key is off - you need to find and fix it.  

12) Get a piece of at least 14 gauge wire, long enough to
    reach from the battery to the generator.  Strip the
    ends and hold one end to the battery positive terminal
    and then touch the other one briefly to the D+ terminal
    on the generator.  This may spark and the generator
    may try to turn like a motor - this is OK.  What you
    are doing is polarizing the generator.

13) Go up front and start the Bus.  See if the generator
    light is glowing.

14) Go back in the back and measure the battery voltage
    again.  It will _probably_ be more than 6.30 V or
    12.60 V, but at idle, it may not be.  Goose the engine
    up to about 1000-1500 rpm and make sure the voltage
    is then above 6.30 V or 12.60 V.  Run the engine all
    the way up to 3000 rpm or so.  The voltage should
    rise up to a point, but it should level off... if it
    ever gets to be more than about 7.50 V or 15.0 V,
    or never gets above 6.30 V or 12.60 V, your regulator,
    generator, battery, or the wires between them may be
    bad.

15) Go for a ride and see what happens. 

If the above fails to get it, there's something else you
can try.  Get a piece of at least 14 gauge wire that is
long enough to go from the coil to the battery.  String
it over the engine where it won't get caught on any
moving or hot parts.  Crimp a female push-on to the coil
end.  Unplug the black wire at the coil (the one that
doesn't go to the distributor) and tape up the loose end.
Plug your new wire onto the coil where the black wire was.

Over at the battery, disconnect the ground strap.  Crimp
a ring terminal on the end of your new wire, take off the
nut on the positive terminal clamp, put the ring terminal
over the bolt, and replace and tighten the nut.  Then
reconnect the ground strap.

What you are doing is bypassing all the wire that runs
from the engine to the cab and back again, and the
ignition switch.  The coil is powered directly from the
battery.  Go for a drive and see what happens.  Note
that when you shut off the key, the engine will keep
running - put the e-brake on and let out the clutch
to stall it and stop it.  As soon as you get out of the
Bus, go to the back, unplug the new wire you installed
at the distributor, and TAPE UP THE END.  If you leave
that wire hooked up and the distributor stopped with 
the points closed, you can cook your coil.  If you don't
tape up the end of the wire, you can cook your Bus.

If everything is now great, then the harness from front to
back, or the ignition switch, or the connection at the
fuse box is suspect.  If it's still bad, then the battery,
generator, regulator, coil, points, and condenser are
suspect.  When you are done with the experiments,
disconnect the ground strap, remove your new wire, plug
the original black wire back onto the coil, and reconnect
the ground strap.

Good luck!
