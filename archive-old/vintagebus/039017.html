Kinda late notice, but if any of ya'll Texas bus-nuts wanna come join us,
the Lone Star Transporter Association of Dallas, TX is having it's &quot;Busses
Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot; campout this weekend March 27-28 in West, TX
(just N. of Waco).

We're a pretty laid-back bunch of folks and this is a real low-key weekend.
No show, no swap meet.  Just a bunch of good people hanging out, having fun,
and ingesting a lot of food and drink.

For camping reservations, call KOA (800) 562-4199 ($16.00/night).

For more info, e-mail me at mike_gensler_at_udscorp_dot_com
