&lt;&lt; Thanks, I took advantage of your advice in your reply to my first post 
before the stripping began.  Armed with 6 bottles of 3M Safest Stripper, we 
went at it, but it is hard to guage just how long to leave it on.  
('specially when it dries before really getting the yechy paint off).&gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
We have used Naval Jelly from our FLHWS and to prevent having this dry to 
fast have found it best to use it in cool weather and/or early morning to 
prolong it's affectiveness.  Also have used plastic wrap to cover the 
chemicaled area which really helps.  Have not tried this latter method with 
the safest stripper yet.  So if it works for you please tell us!
 
&lt;&lt; We'll probably be using more, rather than sand ourselves to death on some 
of the major areas.  Does Safest Stripper really leave the original paint?  
If so, how, and why?  &gt;&gt;
Good question!  It probably would remove the original paint if applied long 
enough which is why we test time it to do only the work we want it to do.
