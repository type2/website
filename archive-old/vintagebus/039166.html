Morning list

I am dazed and confused. Was up until 3 this morning putting the wiring
back into my '61 right hand drive double cab. Everything worked fine
except for the flashers(indicators). On disassembly of the bus I
recorded the positions and colour coding of every wire I so much as
looked at, then feeling smug I cut everything off.

Problem is the wires that get soldered onto the indicator stalk(six of
the little bastards) seem to have changed colour all on their own while
in the panel shop. OK that's not true I obviously made a mistake while
recording the stuff.

Three of the positions are correct(green/white , green , yellow) as the
colours are bright and little stubs of wire remained on the stalk
assembly. I therefore have three wires that I'm unsure about.

I have three questions for the moment:

(1) Can the flasher unit be burned out if the connections at the stalk
are wrong?( I tried a couple of combinations     so far without
success).
(2) Is there a way to test whether the flasher is still functional?
(3)Is there a routine for determining the positions of the of the three
uncertain wires on the stalk?

I have checked the archives but haven't found anything specific. I also
downloaded two of Thom's wiring diagrams which were a great help with
pretty much all the other stuff but as there isn't a year specific
diagram for my my bus the flasher stuff didn't seem to apply.

I have spent so much money on this project that I have pretty much
killed my budget so I'd like to fix this thing myself if it as at all
possible. PLEASE HELP ME!
