Subject: Re: Gas drain tube behind filler flap in dual cab

Hi Robert,

You wrote: &quot;am wondering if crews have a drain tube running down from
the  gas tank filler spout 
support(like other splits?)&quot;

That part of my '59 was in good shape when I got it and I found no
evidence of a drain tube. I would like to mod mine to accept one as its
absence leads to petrol slopping about if I fill it close to 100%. Those
bitty little tanks hold little enough as it is.

Michael
