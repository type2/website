Subject: valve adjustment changes

After adjusting the valves about 75 miles ago I find
that no. 3 cylinder exhaust valve is too loose again. 
I don't know whether I miss adjusted the valve or
what,  but I readjusted it and it seems to be holding
now.  My question is what would be the cause of a
valve loosening repeatedly after adjusting it?  I am
keeping a log of all the valve adjustment changes but
I'm not sure how to read this data.  Thanks for the
help.
