&gt; Since so many people didn't mind reading about the little fox that likes
to
&gt; live in the lumber yard where I work, I took some pizza to work and lured
&gt; him out with it...getting some photos of him in the process.  Just go to
&gt;
&gt; http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/fox/foxy.htm
&gt;
&gt; and let me know what you think.  He's a cute little bugger. :-)
