Subject: Gypsies... grrrrr

Well you know about these people - actually historically they were just 
nomadic (sp?) people but they've got a bad vibe these days in the EU.  
Anyway picture the scene...

It's a nice sunny and crisp February morning and we (myself and wife 
(Sally)) decide to wash etc. the fleet of vehicles.  So we are dressed 
in 'old clothes' for the job.  Sally is polishing her Mahle alloys on 
her Cal'd T3 (nice) and I'm well doing car type stuff (err.... I kind of 
mess with old Fiat as well gulp).  Anyway some passerby somments to his 
kid that there are the Gypsies!!!!!!!   I didn't hear it but Sally did 
and well I just wanted to chase after the guy and say:  &quot;but if you look 
on www.thesamba_dot_com, you'll see the value of a '57 original samba....&quot;  
- I don't suppose it would account for very much though : (

I guess it didn't help that I opted to start the '57 via the crank 
handle that morning - just for fun - he he ...

Lee '57 deeeeeeluxe
