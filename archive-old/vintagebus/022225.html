I'm cleaning out the garage!

The big items I have for immediate clearance are a Das Bulli Haus wheel
arch and rocker section, and a full set of Das Bulli Haus floors, both left
and right - the full monty, not the repair sections.  These pieces are
brand new.

Vents: I have 2 vent sections, great for repairing collision damage or PO
modifications.  THese were cut from NOS sections - I had to keep the
barndoor vents on my bus.

Rocker trim: I have two sets of deluxe rocker trim, both with minor
scratches and needing cleanup.

Cargo doors: I have a set of windowed high-hinge (early) cargo doors, and
one near-NOS cargo door, high hinge.  I also have a set of slightly
thrashed barndoor cargo doors which could be sectioned and repaired.  I
also have a slightly thrashed set of barndoor *panel* cargo doors.

I'm in Sacramento. These things will be a pain to ship, so I'd rather sell
to someone local.  I could even deliver within a reasonable distance for
additional consideration.

I'll have some smaller stuff as well once I get done.

All prices negotiable.
