Subject: Re: [VB] re:Bus Stalling

When I got my 65 westy it had sat a long time, and the fuel filters keopt 
gumming up and the carb, and I'd get these times wher ethe bus would stall and 
die, I could remove the fuel line from the pump (the one from the tank) and 
nothing came out, so I'd blow through to clear the blockage, and fuel woul come 
out, replace teh line.   I ended up putting a magnet on a stick down the tank 
for a while, that instantly stopped the stalling problem.  

 but if there is loose rust in the tank it'll show up in the fuel filter.  

Could be a loose wire.

There it was: that demonic rubber disc. Possibly the second most
infuriating prank next to sugar without the engine damage.

Just a thought. It's probably not a lid opener, but it could be sediment or
other gunk.
