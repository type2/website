Subject: [VB] ladders and steps


&gt; Two questions for the group....
&gt; First.  What is the weight limit on the roofrack ladders? I seems to me
that
&gt; if someone that is too heavy climbed one it might dent the beltline or
&gt; something

I have a Westy ladder that fits into the top of the roof rain gutter. Middle
stops are on beltline and bottom  stops on top of tire ....no problems at
all.

What is interesting to me is the ladder shots on buses from VW Trend and Hot
VW's where the ladder is hooked to the Westy roof rack. Sometimes the middle
stops are on the window glass (Deluxe) or upper metal panel and the bottoms
on the top of the wheel arch. On the last page of the most recent Hot VW's
there is a shot of a Westy to be in the next issue..... ladder middle stops
just 1/4&quot; below back window and bottom stops rest on engine lid.

I believe there is supposed to be an original Westfalia bar that fits
between the roof rack back two legs that creates the proper spacing for the
ladder to rest on the belt-line and top tire? Doesn't look like anybody
repos these if this is the case....

Anyway, I wouldn't be climbing on these ladder set-ups for obvious
reasons...
