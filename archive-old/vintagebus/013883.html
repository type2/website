&gt; Chuck you asked, &quot;The earliest '67 in the NEATO

&gt; July 5, 1966 ...Does anyone out there have a earlier
&gt; 67 then mine?&quot;
&gt; That, soon to be no longer the earliest 67 in the
&gt; NEATO registry, is mine.  
&gt; Here is a sum up of this thread: 
&gt; 
&gt; Chuck Notmeyer's 67 - July 6, 1966 - number 559
&gt; Tom Good's 67 Westy - July 5, 1966 - number 597
&gt; Karl's 67 Standard - July 5, 1966 - number 625
&gt; David Easterwood's 1967 Dormobile - July 5, 1966 -
&gt; number 874
&gt; David Easterwood's Kombi  -  July 7, 1966 - number
&gt; 1443
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Chuck, you sure on your date? I'm with Harry in
&gt; Fresno: &quot;Maybe they made up 
&gt; tags on Mondays and used them all week.&quot;

Tom and all others following this intersting thread,
I have double checked my M-Code tag and it matches the
tag on the fresh air vent. The M-Code tag does indeed
read;

06 7
425 015 080 114
UK2312 131383 7000559

I cant explain who it is that my 67 was tagged one day
later then the other with a lower serial number.
Anybody care to jump in and offer a theory?
Also, what happened to all of the Busses with a lower
serial number???
