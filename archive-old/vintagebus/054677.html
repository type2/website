Subject: Re: [VB] VW Jokes

Since it's Friday, how about this one that appeared on RAMVA in May:

A blonde pushes her Bug into a gas station.  She tells the mechanic, &quot;it
died&quot;.

After he works on it for a few minutes, it's idling smoothly.

She says, &quot;what's the story?&quot;

He replies, &quot;just crap in the carburetor.&quot;

She says, &quot;how often do I have to do that?&quot;

[rim shot]
