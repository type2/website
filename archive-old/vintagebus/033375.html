Like the subject line sez.........I need a &quot;Pressed bumper&quot; I have *many* non
pressed bumpers, but I'm pretty sure they wont look so hot on a '54
- -  -- - 
they will look better than no bumper perhaps.    ANyway, those pressed 
bumpers are merely decorations, tinsle,  I suggest welding a steel bar to it 
so it functions.

I *need* perfect  paint and a  straight rust free bus   :):):)   It doesn't 
look so good otherwise.
