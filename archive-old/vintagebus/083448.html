Subject: Re: [VB] Accellerator pedal help

From Clark Smith:

Well, its been a year since I took my 1967 Westfalia apart to replace the floor and i'm finally putting things
back together. I can't figure out what pieces I may have removed between the rod that drops down from the
accellerator pedal and the loop on the front end of the accellerator cable.  I don't have a Bently manual or
equivilent, so i sure would like a description or direction to some web archive someplace so I can have a
look.  I assume its a simple pivot of some kind.

 I then look forward to where it will turn up.  Thanks for any help!
