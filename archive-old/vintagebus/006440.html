Today I did a bunch of odds and ends while I wait for the rear brake stuff
to show up from Ronnie and while I wait for my braided SS brake lines from
Gilbert Sy Chan's brother who had them made at TechnaFit or something like
that.  I started off by sanding the ends of the wires that hook to the
starter solenoid and then hooking the up.  The positive battery cable end
was shelled so I replaced it with a nice brass one I found in my misc parts
drawer.  I fixed some broken crimp connectors as well.

Next I completely and throughly lubed my ebrake cables.  They're good as
new - no fraying or kinks - that's a nice plus.

Since I've found I end up with 'spare' time between parts deliveries from
Ronnie, I use this time to work on the 12v conversion.  So I dropped the
parcel tray and yanked the speedo.  All the little plastic colored things
had fallen off so I needed to get in there and replace them.  In the process
I busted the speedo needle (it was very brittle) but was able to replace it
with one from a 60's beetle.  FYI, the stock colors of my 66 bus speedo when
viewed from the face is red, blue, and green.  I yanked out all the 6v bulbs
and replaced them with 12v bulbs from a 74 std. beetle speedo.  After
cleaning the glass and installing it, I wrapped the speedo in a clean rag
and put it in the tool box for safe keeping.

Next I pulled the Sapphire radio out of the dash and hooked it up via a
resistor drop to a 12v battery I had in the garage.  I assumed the end with
the fuse was the hot lead but could only get the radio to come on when I
used the negative lead on the fused wire.  I get an nice backlit display but
absolutely no audio unless you consider the static pop I get on power up.
Too bad Brad Clausen threw in the towel - I would l sure like to get this
radio to work.

In amidst all of this, 3 friends stopped by and I went and did a steering
wheel pull and ignition trouble shooting on a 74 std. beetle. I was a busy
man.

Any suggestions on who to get to fix my radio?

Thanks for reading...
