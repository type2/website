Subject: Arizona Comment, bus safety

It seems like things are getting out of hand on this hole topic. Don't tell
me a bus has to be shiny and rust free to be safe. I admit there are places
that rust should not be or the bus should be parked, but to say that the
rust hole in my rocker is jeoperadizing the structural integrity of my Crew
Cab is a bit over the top. I am a complete proponent of good brakes, good
steering, insurance, and a seat securely bolted in place. Do I really need
to have good window seals to be safe? Ideally I will have all of those
things listed some day. But as time and money allow.
Just some defensive comments from someone in a safe but not so shiny 60
Crew Cab (it's got a little rust too),
