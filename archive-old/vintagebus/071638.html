&quot;Do these make funny shapes ?&quot;
&quot;Well, No. Unless you think round is funny&quot;.

The o.d. doesn't have to be any larger than the MC flange.
( Any more is just wasted :).
The MC is stepped at the flange, but a single slightly larger 
hole which allows the boot to install normally will work fine.
The relevent dimensional question is:
How thick is it ?

&gt; I paid $40 for the spacer kit in fall 2000 from Wolfgang.  It came
&gt; with the spacer, two longer bolts, the rubber boot, and two seals
&gt; for the reservoir-to-MC connection.  The spacer looked to me like
&gt; it was machined out of a chunk of thick aluminum rod.  If you had
&gt; the tools it'd be simple to make - cut off a piece of rod, drill
&gt; the smaller center hole all the way through, drill the bigger center
&gt; hole almost all the way through, drill the bolt holes, smooth the
&gt; flat surfaces, deburr, done.  Someone in the local VW club, who
&gt; has access to machine tools, measured my spacer before I put it
&gt; on the Bus; I think he intended to make one of his own.
