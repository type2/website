Well, I'm closing in on a deal to get a European '59 Single-Cab. It's got
the semophores on it. No engine. Original split-case tranny.

My question:

What's involved in switching out the split-case tranny with another new
one? Will it swap right out, or do I have to replace the whole rear-end
redux boxes and all?

Oh yeh, the price...$500.00!!!!
