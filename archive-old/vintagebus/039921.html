&gt;From: &quot;Jay Cronen&quot; &lt;jcronen_at_excel_dot_net&gt;
&gt;Contemplating the relative merits of splittie vs. bay window and I have a
&gt;few questions to ask of the other esteemed list members. This is NOT a
&gt;debate of which is the better bus.
&gt;
&gt;1.) The Bay windows do not have spur reduction gears correct? How does this
&gt;translate into real world drivability?

No reduction gears, a different tranny, you probably will notice higher 
speeds then a stock early tranny, but freeway flyer trannys negate this.


Does it mean a higher top end at the
&gt;expense of low-end torque which would adversely affect any (gentle) 
&gt;off-road
&gt;use in addition to less slogging-ability through snow here in Wisconsin.

Off road the later busses are smoother riding in gravel, but the way the 
early busses lift their rear ends offers better stearability, but overall, 
the split being smaller seems like a better perfromer here. Besides the 
front end is tougher.

&gt;2.) The heat and driver controls are better in the Bay windows correct? But
&gt;they lack the overhead vent. Generally though, the Bay window should be a
&gt;warmer vehicle for cold weather cruising?
I dont know about controls being better. What do you mean? What bay window 
are we talking about here? Since the splitty is smaller a simular setup 
engine with the same output of heat it will heat better. I am mostly talking 
splitty vs 68-71 busses. And yes that overhead cooling is much better.
&gt;
&gt;3.) The driving position in the splitties are more forward with less of a
&gt;dash and a flatter steering wheel therefore more bus-like which appeals to
&gt;me immensely. The Microbus--Volkswagen would do good to go back to that
&gt;original idea.
&gt;

OH YEAH! When I drive my bay it feels like a car. That steering wheel is not 
flat enough!
