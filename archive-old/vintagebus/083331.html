Subject: Re: [VB] Ride in a bus.

At this point, my bus interior is fully lined with dynamat extreme and JCW
Heatshield insulation. That is: doors, roof, walls, and floor. I don't think
that the passenger buses had even close to that.  I have not yet installed
the plywood camper interior. Noise is bad enough that ear plugs are a must
have  on the highway.

&gt; the passenger busses had more soundproofing from the factory.
&gt; my old 69 deluxe was quite quiet. my 68 kombi needs some work.
