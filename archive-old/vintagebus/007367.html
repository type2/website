this guy glynn prattled on a bit didn't he!

loads of replies... Thank You All!

so, something i've never come across yet - (so it's bound to be &lt;g&gt;) .. was
what 9 out of 10 bus folk prefere --&gt; bad flex hose.

I haven't yet managed to get to work on the brakes since posting....either
busy elsewhere or it's been too wet.
but... metal pipes are all brand new. (1 year) so i'd have thought the flex
hoses were too (not necessarily fact tho).
a few folk suggest it might have something to do with the master cylinder
push rod/ freeplay ..
when it stops raining-- how do i check for this?
you see, the p o fitted a 68 front beam..... not sure what he did to the
master cylinder - or what cylinder from what he used.
it's not under my feet, with access to the reservoir by the pedals.. but now
(whatever it is) it's fitted somewhere else with the reservoir inside the
storeage hole thing (never know what thats called) under the bench seat.

I've no idea what has been done here - so this might be a cause of the
trouble - but its only sticking on the one drum now. so wouldn't this
make sense that the master cylinder is ok?

anyone have an idea what master cylinder he might have used, and is it usual
to move it on fitting a 68 bj beam to a 60 split?
also, what do i look for with the freeplay /rod length?

I'm hoping to get on the job today - but at least the rain is giving me a
&lt;er&gt; brake - from the brakes -- i've had the wheels, drums etc off so many
times in the last few weeks. -- i could do it blindfolded with my arms tied
behin..... no i couldn't!! :)

I get the idea with the hoses, and even if they're not that old, i'd go for
one being bunged up or perished inside. tho i might as well check everything
else while i'm waiting for the wife to get paid.
