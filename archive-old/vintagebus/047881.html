&lt;&lt; So just show the dmv the birth certificate and explain the problem?&gt;&gt;
Hi Derrick,
Hope so!  Not knowing your location and probably your state laws....

&lt;&lt;Is there a quicker way to prove that the title # is the engine number?&gt;&gt;
Well if you were in Washington state we would just have it titled under a 
three year title.  After that three years you get a normal title.

&lt;&gt;
A bit of time and not always correct!  Plus last time we heard the microfiche 
they were using had deteriorated to the point that they had stopped doing 
birth certificates.  Has anyone heard if they now have new microfiche?  We 
had heard that some VW club in Germany was trying to help them get the info 
onto disc.
