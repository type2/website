 I have a couple heads I'm wondering on . .

 Maybe some of you have seen the like before . .

 I bought this FO case from some guy a long time ago . .
a long block . . the heads were off and in a box . .
I think I was interested in the case at the time and barely
looked at the heads . . cardboard box and I recall thinking
they were single ports . .

 I've been moving in and the box on the heads got lost . .
What is wrong with these things . . ?  the spark plugs are
at a weird angle . . they angle out toward the ends of the 
heads at about 15 degrees . .

 They have two rocker arm assemblies . . a short one over each
piston and mounted on square mounting bosses . .
 The rocker arms themselves . . each is unique and smells like
these porsche rockers I saw once . . they are not as long as 
the porsche though . . 

 The last unique feature is that they are dual port and the 
inlet is on the top and the exhaust is on the bottom . .
directly opposing each other . . no exhaust out on the end
like a VW . . these ports are directly over the center of 
the combustion chamber . .

 Haven't seen a part number on them and I did look . . :-)

 What are they guys ?  . . . :-)

 west . . thanks . .  :-)
