If you're looking for asbestos, take off the accordian tube that
connects the heater box to the duct.  Pull out the metal ring on the
end and check out the gray collar inside.  It sure looks like
asbestos to me.  The accordian tubes I've looked at came off a 71 Bus
and a 74 Beetle.

&gt;I sort of assumed perhaps blindly that due to the vintage and 
&gt;appearance
&gt;of all the krap that came out of the blanket and the construction of
&gt;the few bits of blanket that asbestos was used.
&gt;
&gt;I have no lab at my disposal or parts lists. However. I have learned 
&gt;my
&gt;lesson...
&gt;
&gt;1) Don't dive into a convo on a partial quote of the original message
&gt;2) wear a darned mask regardless.
&gt;
&gt;sorry all..
&gt;
&gt;dust bad...bad dust...
