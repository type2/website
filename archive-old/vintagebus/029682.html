&gt; Anyone know of a source for new westy jalousie window screens? I don't
&gt; even have one to use for a template. What are my alternatives if they're
&gt; no longer available?

Dunno of a new source but I've made my own easily.  They're just
standard aluminum-framed screens AFAIK.  I took a spare house screen and
removed the old mesh.  The frame just pulls apart, with L shaped gizmos
that slip inside the framing to hold it together.  Measure and angle-cut
the ends of the aluminum pieces, reassemble and test-fit.  You can buy a
plastic roller tool (sorta looks like a pizza cutter with wheels on both
sides) that makes it easy to roll in the new screening and the beading. 
Check your local hardware/home depot type place and they should have all
you need.  Black mesh will give you a little sunshading, too.
