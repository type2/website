Subject: Got that trans, now what...East coast rebuilders?

Importance: Normal

I managed to score a 50k mile 67 trans, tunring freely, not H20 in it, and
decent looking oil. Surface rust is on tubes and rgbs. 46s are tight, and
someone butchered a backingplate, so disassembly without a bus weight might
be fun. No leaks visible.
	Many have told me to slap this thing in and go, but I was hoping to get it
freshend without the horror stories I hear about whinny trans, and that I
should stick with the virign build, etc. Also I am east coast, and since
this thing is heavy, I'd like to know if anyone recommends any one  on east
coast for stock type II rebuilds and rgbs. I really want the exterior redone
also, so if I do the boxes my self and take a chance on the trans, what can
I use for finish without meessing up the guts? Is a nasty input shaft a big
problem, even if splines are good?
	At this point, it looks like Rancho is going to get it, but they are so
busy I will be out of business for a month or more. Is there any real way to
diagnose much on a trnas that is just lying there? I was thinking a drill
and rubber hose to turn the trans at some rpms to listen for noise...
Decision time....
