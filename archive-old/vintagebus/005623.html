&gt; Well, this is a note to let those of you on the list that have
understanding
&gt; significant others, to let them do your dealing on vehicles.  This weekend
&gt; my wife bought me a 1966 split deluxe bus and a 1971 bay camper.   &gt;
&gt; Boy, it sure is nice having a wife that also enjoys the VW adiction as
much
&gt; as I do.

Women dealing on vehicles can go both ways. Being a woman, I have also been
treated by prospective sellers as if I had no clue what I was talking about
or looking at. One such sale was with my significant other along for the
ride...I knew more than he about VWs, but the car salesman (yes, it was at a
dealer) would only look at Matt when speaking, even when responding to a
question that *I* had posed. Women are more likely to be taken advantage of
in a sales or repair situation. I try to learn as much about a vehicle as I
can ahead of time. It helps to be armed with information, whether you are
male or female!

If only we were all so lucky to have such VW supportive spouses! :-)
Congrats!
