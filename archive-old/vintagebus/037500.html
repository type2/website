 We are looking for a new reproduction or NOS headlight switch for our 59
 bus.  The dash light dimmer function has died on it.  Looks like the
 part number is 211 941 511D.  It has the push on terminals.
  &gt;&gt;
FWIW your 59 came with screw terminals.  someone changed over to push on 
since it was new.   VW switched in late 60 (early 61)
