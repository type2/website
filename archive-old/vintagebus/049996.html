We are not anti-lowering. I think the gentleman from Australia should load
1500 lbs. of horse manure in there and bring it home to compost. That would
lower it severely. Or, I think you should have 15 friends over and haul
them all to the ball game.

David S (I think it was him) once reported moving an entire grand piano,
having removed the poptop to fit it all in vertically. Now THAT would lower
a bus.
