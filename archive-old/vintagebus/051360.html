Subject: Re: [VB] Jim Thompson Health Update

&gt;Thought it might me appropriate to pass along the info that Jim Thompson of
&gt;http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com suffered a pretty serious heart attack
&gt;yesterday on the evening of the 30th.

really weird - i had JUST finished reading my last post from jim and was
about to make a reply when this message came in... needless to say
questions about T3 distributors went out the window in favor of
hang-in-there-tigers!

send him a note to cheer him on... we owe him a lot for work he has done
for us over the years.
