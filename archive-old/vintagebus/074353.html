Curt, all things being equal, if your head studs are factory length from the
case face, you should be using the factory thick washers which sit in that
depression where your nut is hiding now.

I just cleaned up a set of 10mm and 8mm head washers earlier this week for two
new engines I'm building. If you can't come up with a set let me know. Just a
warning though, Friday I leave for Orlando for two weeks, so if you want some
from me, you'll have to wait!

I have a question about seating heads and cylinders for head space.
Some of the nuts on the head, (on top, I think) seat well below the
wider hole and the socket won't fit.  What to do?

Options, go by a Sears socket and grind it thin to fit.

Options, get a dremel and grind the hole out large enough for the
socket to fit.
