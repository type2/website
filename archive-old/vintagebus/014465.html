 I am trying to remove the headlight switch from the dash and can't seem to
 do it. The other switches came out easy enough - remove the knob, unscrew
 retaining ring with needle-nose pliers, out pops the switch. The headlight
 switch, however, doesn't have the notches on the retaining ring. So how do
 you remove it????

Hi Rob,
Have you tried to look under the knob of the switch at the ledge under the
switch.  If there is a srew there then undo it and remove the switch.  Eric &amp;
