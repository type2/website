Subject: Re: [VB] Re: dirty bus...jigsaw puzzles

I suggest buying a box of latex gloves.  Take them off and toss them when 
you're done.  It makes cleaning up much easier.   Available at drug stores,

the orange hand cleaner smells much nicer than 'gunk'   it is slightly gritty 
in texture and works really well.  I don't like the way 'gunk' smells or 
feels either.  Have a hat.  I have a knitted wooley cap designated for VW 
tinkering.

hpoefully your bus is not too filthy.   I and take mine to a car wash and 
pressure clean the engine compartment once in a while after spraying simple green 
liberally .    Showed someone my engine in Yakima and he said it was really 
clean, but it had been over a year  since the last wash, and had bits of dust 
and grit around, but was not a filthy scummy tarry murky mess.   The bottom 
line is that doing a tune up I don't get that dirty, because the bus isn't.  

get in the habit of checking the oil every time you put gas in it.   Take a 
minute to look and see nothing came loose, check the fan belt tension etc.

I like jigsaw puzzles....  just wondering if that's connected to being able 
to understand how buses work... anyone else a jigsaw fan as a small child?
