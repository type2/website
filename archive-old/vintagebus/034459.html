&lt;&lt; Hey, this weekend ,on Sunday, November 8th the International Bus Meet is
 taking place in the Madera County Fairgrounds in Madera, CA. 
 Madera is located about 20 miles north of the city of Fresno along Highway
 99.
 
 It is probably one of the few shows held at this time of year.  &gt;&gt;

And on the East coast........

Saturday, November 7th. The 5th annual Bulli Brigade, this show is at Reeves
Volkswagen in Tampa. All buses are invited to this one also, but only splits
will be in the &quot;gate&quot;. A relaxed swap, show, bull session, caravan deal. 
 
After the show we will caravan to the host motel for the following day's Bug
Jam in Dade City, at the Pasco county fairgrounds. this sis going to be a big
bus party!!!!!!!!
