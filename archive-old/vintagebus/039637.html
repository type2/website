well, that was quite a mouthful... although you werent actually talking. if 
we were at a bar, we could argue this topic all nite. it would be fun. that 
might have been the most stereotypical thing i have ever read. i thought i 
might get the last word in. i am not a hippie, dont proport to be, dont 
smell like patcholi oil, dont have dreads, but will bang disrythmically on 
my bong late into the night. i will agree that pseudo-hippies have given the 
hemp thing a bad name, but attitudes like yours will never get hemp taken 
seriously.

it seems every day i see acres of trees being leveled so new housing 
developments can be created. i guess this cant be avoided, because of the 
rising population and the rising life expectancy. BUT, when acres of trees 
are mowed down to produce paper products, that to me is the problem. a crop 
of hemp, in 4 months, can produce the same amount of paper that acres of 
decades-old trees are sacraficed for. i try to recycle what i can, but the 
demand for paper far exceeds the recycling rate in this country. and now 
that new york is trucking their garbage to ohio's landfills, for instance, i 
think some alternative means should be considered instead of just saying, 
&quot;ahh, those silly hippies and their smelly hemp s#it.&quot;

(Thom)&gt;The only &quot;advantage&quot; of hemp seat covers is the bragging rights to 
tell all your pictuli-oiled friends that you have hemp seat covers

they would probably out last your vinyl seat covers.

(Thom)&gt;So what if it (hemp) *was* legalized?  Immediately large commerical 
hemp farms would spring up, and it would be a commodity like cotton and 
soybeans.  Maybe then the hipsters could trade hemp futures - &quot;yeah, dude, I 
just made a fortune in the hemp market, and now I got the munchies, dude, 
duuuude, dude.&quot;

sounds great, i would invest... it wont give you the munchies though.

(Thom)&gt;But legalizing it would take all of the fun out of it.

all your fun of ragging on hippies and their hemp stuff

(Thom)&gt;BTW, I'm not anti-hippie

could have fooled me

(Thom)&gt;Buses existed before hippies, and they'll exist after the last hippie 
has faded into the acid-enhanced sunset; I just hope I live that long...

well, at least we agree on something.

sorry for the bandwidth..
Bob Margiotti
