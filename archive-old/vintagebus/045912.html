Hi , dont tell me you broke down again on the way to the show (no bad vibes 
or pun 
intended) that sucks!!!!
I'm going to try to go to the lancaster show.
but i definetly will be at the maple grove show, been going for a few years 
and its a nice show.
you can still find some nice deals there.  thats where i bought my 62 crewcab 
last 
year.
And for memorial weekend i'll be going to Manassas Va.
I dont go to sell, we take the weekend off from the kids and me and the wife 
go just to have fun, its only 5 1/2 hours from me so its not too bad a drive.
Well have fun.

ps.i seem to remember you saying you drive a green mid 70's baywindow
if you need anything for it let me know, im selling a 73 kombi and have parts 
off a 
72 parts bus (including AC setup).
well im sure well meet up at at least one off the shows.
bye.
