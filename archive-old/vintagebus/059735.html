Subject: Re: [VB] headliners - fuzzy vs. perforated

How about this logic...

Say that you purchased this bus new in 1963 and two years down the road, the
headliner was ripped taking out a 2 X 4 from the lumber yard. Take to the VW
dealer to replace and no doubt a &quot;new&quot; German vinyl headliner would be
installed mid'60s style as per original VW specs.

However, with  Capri pants back in style this summer, shag carpet and/or
crushed velvet can't be too far behind if you want to be &quot;hip&quot;.....

&gt;  my early '63 15 window (production date of july 1962), came originally
with
&gt; a fuzzy cloth headliner.  with the understanding that someone will flame
me
&gt; for even thinking of putting in a perforated headliner, i am seeking
opinions
&gt; of comparing cloth headliners vs. perforated.
