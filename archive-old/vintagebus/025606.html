Subject: Redux bearings for lunch
Message-ID: &lt;37757D1A.1AEDEB7C_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hello Friends,

Yeah, I wish I could change those bearings during a 1 hour lunch break! 

Actually, since I'm the low man on the totem pole at work, I'm scheduled
to work from open till closing everyday and on Saturday mornings too,
but am only allowed 45 hours a week. That means that I have 4 hours a
week to burn (not even counting the 5 lunch hours per week), so I've
been using them on my bus. It's a pretty sweet deal. My lunch hours are
very flexible, and this allows me a good 9 hours a week to spend on my
bus, in a VW shop, with all the tools, and even help when I need it (not
to mention the employee discount on parts)! So if it takes me 4 or 5
hours to do the job, it's no big deal. If something comes up that needs
my immediate attention, I just clock in, do it and clock back out so I
can finish my bus. 

The reasoning behind my just ordering the lower bearings was that I
reckoned that since they support the weight of bus on the axles
(incidently, I'm running 15&quot; bug rims, which are offset out a little
bit, and therefore stress the bearings out that much more), and the
upper bearings don't, maybe it would be ok to just replace those for
now. As many of you have found out by now, those puppies ain't cheap. It
hadn't really occurred to me that since those two gears mesh, if one of
them isn't right on, it's gonna stress the other one out (and the
bearings, too). 

At any rate, I gotta do something pretty quick. 

Today I got behind a girl whose car broke down right in front of me (no,
she's not cute. I'm just a nice guy, despite what you may have heard)
and wound up running her and her kids all over town (kids from the
babysitters, Auto Zone to order a clutch set, shop to talk to a guy
about a tow, etc.) and my bus is getting worse. I don't have another car
to drive. I can't start on it one day and finish it the next. I'm just
having to baby it and try to keep the mileage down.

So, the soup du jour for monday is... redux bearings...
