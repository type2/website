Subject: Re: [VB] AN INTERACTIVE VINTAGE BUS EMAIL!

Okay, I simply cannot escape these emails.  And especially a VW related 
one!  So here we go!  And warnings...I corrected a lot of the spelling and 
grammar in the questions.

&gt;1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac?

Birth.  I was brought home from the hospital 25 years ago in a dark blue 
'67 Beetle.

&gt;2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if they're
&gt;not all the same)

1966 Hardtop Deluxe at the age of 10 for $50...next door neighbour used it 
as a storage shed.

&gt;3.how many RUNNING buses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this
&gt;email will be HUGE!)

Just the one....is all I can afford.

&gt;4. do you have a favorite? which one?

My '63 Riviera Camper

&gt;5. stock or custom?

90% stock...if you're being a purist

&gt;6.would you punch an alien?

Only if it was trying to probe me  ;P
