Subject: Radar Detector? (was Gauges in the bus)

Vince,

&gt; I do have my radar detector mounted just below the box on the driver's side.

What on earth do you use a radar detector for in a '67 Westy? :) To
satisfy your curiosity? When your coasting down a 8% grade with a
tailwind? 

Those of us maxed out at 50mph would like to know! :)
