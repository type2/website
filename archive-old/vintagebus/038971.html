&gt; The paper gaskets I do not think are available anymore.
&gt; I just clean the mating surfaces and apply #518 to it.
&gt; Again, works for me and does not leak.

RMMW has these, #211 501 273A (64-67) and #211 501 273 for earlier.
I used them when recently rebuilding my reduction boxes (on a '67),
and they don't leak a bit...at that joint.

One of the boxes started gushing out the seepage drain hole on the back
of the brake plate as soon as I filled them.  It *may* have been an
improperly seated shaft seal (the rotating seal that bears against the
spacer).  I pulled it all apart, though, and had to make a new gasket for
the bearing cover and used blue RTV between the box &amp; brake plate.  That's
held, but still seeps a little.

The other side *was* dry but started leaking after a 100-mile shakedown
cruise, so I just pulled all that apart, got everything absolutely clean and
flat and this time put in a whole new rotating seal (with RTV around the edge
this time).  The outside of the spacer looked a bit rough and burned where it
bears against the seal, so I used a buffing wheel and polishing compound to
smooth it out.  (Will have to do that to the other side now, which is seeping
about a drop or two a day.)

So why couldn't this come up on the list right before I go through it all
myself, instead of right after?
