Subject: EveryBus:the short version

Hi,

It is over. Here is the short version.

Over 120 buses.
Longest distance traveled to the EB was 1053 miles by Mr David 
Schwarze and family to be :)
400 adults and children
Who knows how many dogs
Great chilli
No drums
Wonderful people
Weather was perfect.
Oldest bus 1958
Newest 2001

I owe the following people a thank you for their efforts to make this happen.
My wife Michele for everything
Registration: Chad and Dee Sibert, Judy Neville and Matt Freeman.
Emily Nilsen, nice lady with the crew cab, and Michele for handling 
the kids activities.
Door prizes coordination and signage, Judy Neville
Dave Jersey handles the chilli cook off and did a fine job.
Terry the park ranger and his staff for facilities management.
Royce, Tom and Joel for passing out ballots.
Everyone who came!


I hope everyone that attended had a great time and will come back 
again next year.

Chris,
