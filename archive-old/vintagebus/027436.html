Chuck,

No problem.  My 62 is very straight  with original  L87 white paint
(although I wish it were blue like yours) and low mileage (54K) but some
PO decided long ago that they would like to have the sliding 1/3rd /
2/3rds front bench.  They did a nice clean install and only pop riveted
the brackets in place.  But for some reason they ground off the original
brackets (the 3 position ones for the hump bench) top and bottom.

Question.  Do you know what years that seat/bracket combo came on?  I'm
on the hunt for some to put the correct seat back in the truck, and I've
had conflicting information.  Most people don't even realize the
difference in the front bench from the earlier ones.  I think this is
only a 2 or 3 year thing.

Thanks.

Good to see you made it home OK.

Steve
