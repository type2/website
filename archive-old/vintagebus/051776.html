&lt;&lt; I've noticed this too.  Any air-cooled VW and people feel like they have
to be in front of you.  Old busses make them feel like they may even need
to go to extremes to do this. &gt;&gt;

I call this &quot;gotta pass a bus syndrome&quot;  I could be doing 80 in my '74 Westy, 
which I have been known to do, and they still pass me.  Usually they pull in 
front and slow down once they realize how fast they are going.
