Are you guys talking about the KD &quot;gearwrench&quot; sets? They sell a 12 piece set 8-19 mm. It is closed
end ratcheting on one end and open on the other end. I got a set a while back for about $85.00

I have a set of 5 that is 2 or 3 years old.  It doesn't have a 17 mm,
but it does have a 19 mm.  These are the kind that you flip the whole
wrench over to reverse.

Set 9-42170, &quot;5 Pc. Flat Ratchet Box Wrench Set - Metric&quot;, consisting of
 7 x  8 mm, 42171
 9 x 10 mm, 42172
12 x 13 mm, 42173
14 x 15 mm, 42174
19 x 21 mm, 42175

Online, the only 17 mm wrenches they list are an offset ratchet box
wrench 11 x 17 mm 43028, and a combination open-end/reversible ratchet
17 mm 42428 (the kind with a little reversing lever).

All 3 of the 5-piece sets they show online have the same sizes as the
42170 set.  They have two sets of combination open-end/reversible
ratchet wrenches: 5 piece (8 10 12 13 14) and 7 piece (8 10 12 13 14
15 18).
