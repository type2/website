Check the rocker assembly studs.  I had (stupidly) used nylock nuts to secure them down.  They ended up grabbing the stud too tightly and started to strip the threads.  I thought the valves were clapping and kept adjusting the valves.  I finally figured out that it was the assembly slapping against the boss.  I lock tited the threads and all is good now.

That's a good possibility (loose pulley, improper fit), I had that happen to
me. I'm sure you checked your valves, but another possibilty. Number three
will usually tighten up faster than the rest cause of the extra heat it has
to deal with and that will cause rocker noise.
