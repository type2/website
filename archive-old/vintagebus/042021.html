My few meager comments...


Yikes, someone asking 10k could sure get a better scanner! lol.


If anyone gets interested in this, I'd love to find out about that
&quot;fridge.&quot;

All of the so-44 info I have is 1966 specific, but there is NO avaiable
fridge. Only the standard icebox.  OTOH, I've seen 68+ so69's (the later
version of the so44) with some real oddball fridge installs..and they were
all claimed to be original.


Also, at least for the 66, the &quot;stove&quot; should be a white-gas fired
Coleman-type unit.  Just sits next to the sink.

Memory serves that the jalousie windows were an option...the roof rack was
standard equipment. (ha! my OO told the dealer to keep it, he was to short
to use it...sigh.)

Yes, the red covers were an option over the gold ones.

I'd trade my 66 for this one any day...but dont tell her!:)
