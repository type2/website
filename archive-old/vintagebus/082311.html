Subject: Re: [VB] Surface Removal

If your removing the whole paint job you could try chemical remover. 
Airline Stripper I think it's called. Can be bought at Autozone. Messy, but 
works. Where eye and hand protection. Follow the directions.

If your just removing paint in the rusty areas, sandblasting works good. I 
actually sandblasted my WHOLE single cab. Works great. Can take a while. 
Also need a really big compressor to do a big job. Small compressor and a 
syphon blaster from Wal-Mart will work on spot blasting. You need a big 
pressure pot to do a whole vehicle.

There's a 3M paint remover that will fit on your drill &amp; I'm sure they make 
pads for sanders too. It looks like a black or maroon sponge kind of thing, 
but is hard. Works great for stripping paint. Check your local hardware 
supercenter.

Watch out with the 60 grit. You can use it for the paint, but don't scar up 
your metal. Stop before you get to that point and change sandpaper to 
something less abrasive.

I'd suggest NOT taking the truck down to the metal. If you need to remove a 
layer of &quot;repaint&quot; or something, just take it off until you reach the VW 
stuff. VW primer/paint is pretty good rust resisitant and does fine if left 
on there. Just remove paint where you are gonna do body or metal work or 
need to get rust out. Some good hi-build primer will take care of the edges 
between paint and bare metal.
