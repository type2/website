Subject: RE: [VB] Restoring heat exchangers

That's not the problem my HE's suffered from. I had welded up the tin and
repaired two broken tabs only to find out that the exhaust pipe inside had a
hole. I had to drive with my wind wings open to keep from getting gassed
out!

Subject: [VB] Restoring heat exchangers


After experiencing the lack of heat from Dansk HD boxes, I want to clean
up and restore my old german ones. Physically, just need a tab replaced
and the outer housings rewelded to the tubes to keep them still. Is
there any way to have these chem dipped, or should I just wire wheel
them down and paint? Was hoping I could find  a place to dip them, if
that's ok, to clean up the insides.
