&gt;The tear down was simple and gave me a chance to notice the
&gt;oily dust build-up in the front (FIF) of the casing.  Seems
&gt;that if you have oil flying around for whatever reason some
&gt;will get fed through to the alternator.

I believe the tin piece that goes on the front of the alternator
(and later generators) is designed to route some of the air from
the fan shroud through the alternator to cool it.  So if there's
oil in the cooling air, some of it will make it through the
alternator.
