about getting inside of the locks of a 63... how do the tumblers come out? 
all the locks on a bus...I'm going to match them to an ignition switch I 
believe....  &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
First you have to remove the handles and ignition switch from the bus.  Next 
check each, and every lock for the key pattern code to make sure they all 
take the same key.  Have a real locksmith cut a new key to the code (Not to 
the old worn, or badly ground out fromt the local hardware store key!) you 
are going to use, which most likely will be the ignition switch key code.  
Then you dissassmble the handles and remove the teeny tiny set screw to allow 
each of the tumblers to come out.  Watch out for the brass pins and springs 
which like to sprong away!  Then switch the pins around until you can match 
all of them to the new ignition key.  
   Or have your local older locksmith do the work or Gabriel's in California 
can do even a better job.   Eric&amp;Barb
