Howdy All:

I'm looking for a pair of cherry pop-out frames, ones that I can just take a screwdriver and unscrew the four screws, or that are already disassembled waiting for new seals.  No Liquid Wrench, no drilling out, no rust on the bottom edge, etc.  I have plenty of those.

If no one has any, how 'bout 2 pieces of Sigla pop-out glass, any version so long as it's Sigla, minimal fogging and bubbleing preferred.  

Basically I've gotten lazy on certain items.  I'm going all out on the Westy cabinets, just don't feel like pouring 6 hours into persuading two pop-out frames apart.

I have parts to trade, let me know what you have.

Robert
