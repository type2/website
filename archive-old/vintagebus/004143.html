Have you ever removed your brake drum on your VW, only to find out that the
little piece of spring steel that keeps the adjusting stars from turning has
rusted so bad that either it's extremely brittle or has already broken off?
Well I learned a trick from my grandfather that has proven itself time and
time again.  I repaired these little things on the buggy that I gave to Russ
Maak and had to repair one on the bus.  It's a fix that allows you replace
them rather easily if in the future, they break again.

First of all, you have to remove the backing plate and all the brake
hardware.  Next you make sure that both &quot;tangs&quot; are broken off.  Chances are
if one is gone, the other is about ready to break off anyways.  I usually
then take a grinder and carefully grind off the remains of the tang (it's
usually tack welded right in the middle) or just grind the ends off evenly
so you have somewhat smooth surface.  The main thing is that this area is
flat with no little pieces of metal sticking up so as to interfere with the
replacement part.

You'll need a piece of steel banding which is a mild spring steel.  I get
mine from work where banding up units of lumber is a regular occurence.  You
should be able to walk into any lumber yard and ask them for a little piece
of banding.  No more than 6 inches should be required.  Sometimes you can
get what you need out of the trash but make sure it doesn't appear rusty
because after all, you are replacing a rusted part.  There is some expensive
banding out there that is galvanized which would be the ultimate stuff to
use but not many places have the pocketbook to afford it.  This stuff is
easily several hundred buck a roll I've been told.

Put your adjuster stars in their proper place and then carefully measure the
width you will need to cover from one adjuster star to the other.  You will
also need to measure the proper width so you don't have this big slab of
banding hanging out and interfering with the drum.  I sse an awl and scribe
my marks and then use a square the make sure I've got a precision line to
follow.  Big cuts are done with tin snips whereas fine trimming is done with
a grinder.  What I do next is carefully clamp the banding into place on the
adjuster star carrier, then using the drill press and some blocks of wood -
match drill through the banding into the carrier.  Then you tap new threads
for a small short bolt (I used whatever I find in the remnant bolt box - no
big science here) and voila - you've created a replaceable adjuster star
tang.  We're not quite done yet though - your banding is still smooth and
needs a little divot that will sit in the valleys of the star.  What I do is
line up the valley and place a chisel on the banding.  Usually one or 2 hits
with the hammer creates just right right size divot so that the star can
turn for adjument but not turn on its own.

This does involve a slight amount of machine work but anyone that wants to
be able to work on an old VW should have a tap and die set as a mandatory
requirement - I don't know how I would ever manage without my set.

If anyone would like theirs repaired in order to spare the $30 replacement
cost, I'd be willing to do it for a small fee.  I would prefer that the
parts be thoroughly cleaned with a good wire brushing/soap and water
scrubbing prior to shipment.  Details can be discussed off list if you are
interested.

Oh and I do reserve the right to use SAE bolts if I have to. :-)
