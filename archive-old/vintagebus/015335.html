I too went thru a similar dilema.  When I was a youngster, I always
drove VW's, up until '88 when I bought a 911.  A few years later,
I got a '67 and pimped it up, and then it burned down.  So I got
another one, and this one stayed up (now I just need *huge* tracts
of land...)

I sold the 911 a year later to fund the purchase of the '54 RHD.  The '56
was my daily driver, 60 miles round trip to work every day, plus
surfing trips on the weekends, trips to VW shows, you name it.

The Porsche hankering was still strong, so eventually I got another 911
in the summer of 98.  A week and a half later I got rear-ended in the 911
on sunrise.  It wasn't hard enuf to damage the 911 much - it has those
funky bumper-shocks, but it would have seriously creamed the bus.  The
previous fall, I'd had some damage repaired where an x-girlfriend had
backed into it.

I had countless near-misses, where I'd hear squealing tires, look up in 
the rear view and see a soccer mom on cell phone with the brakes on the
SUV locked up.

There's been a lot of nice buses in this down destroyed by idiotic
drivers: Ed Abbot's '56 panel (from the Endangered Species bus poster -
how ironic) and Jim Bass's '67 westy come immediately to mind.  And
that's just Sacramento!  How many are destroyed in LA or Seattle or
Dallas or ...?

I started to realize that I was putting this car in mortal danger by
driving it on Sacramento streets.  The bus was relegated to &quot;backup&quot;
status and the 911 is now the primary vechicle.

So what am I getting at?  There's a fine line between &quot;gotta drive 'em&quot;
and &quot;gotta preserve 'em.&quot;  I don't consider my '60 DD to be particularly
&quot;rare&quot; or extraordinarily valuable, so I won't have a problem driving it
more than I do the '55.  (however, with what I have into it, you'd
think I filled the rockers with 20's!)  Every person will have to make
the decision for themselves wether the bus is worth more to them on
the street, where they risk it's demise, or in the garage, and
bring it out on special occasions.
