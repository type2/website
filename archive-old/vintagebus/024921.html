&lt;&lt; &gt;Does anyone have any original type 3 &quot;cool tin&quot; they'd like to sell?  I
 &gt;know there's aftermarket pieces, and they're junk.  I'd like to put these
 &gt;on my engine too - my off-road friends swear by it.
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks
 
 The original tin is the best, but you can make the aftermarket tin hold as
 tightly by taking a rat tail file and rounding out the areas that are
 supposed to &quot;snap&quot; around the studs.
 
 Most of the aftermarket tin was not rounded out enough so after a short
 time, the tin would come loose and rattle.
 
 With the original tin getting harder to get, this is a good replacement.
 And BTW, you are correct, the type 3 tin will cool MUCH better, it wraps
 the cylinder much further.
  &gt;&gt;
so, ...is the cool tin really cool?   who knows.  I know some one who says 
it's great, but anyone have comparisons?    I have some cool tin and didn't 
put it on the last motor I buildt.
