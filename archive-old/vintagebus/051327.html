Subject: Re: [VB] T4 tranny into a vintagebus

I worked on this one for quite a while and found that it really can't be done
without cutting and hacking due to the size of the trans.  Unfortunately, I
didn't take notes as to which dimension was the problem.  My tired and worn out
brain seems to remember something about it being LONGER than a type 1 trans.
The bus into bug adapters (I believe) are designed for Baja's and have the room
to stick the ass end out a little longer.
For the difinitive answer, talk with Joe Locicero at Oregon Performance
Products.

Believe me, I tried hard to make it work.  A buddy picked up a brand spanking
new rebuilt in an engine/trans deal that he happened on and was going to give it
to me as a &quot;thanks for the help&quot;.  I measured and measured again but couldn't
get it to work out.

Now since you are talking custom and wouldn't care about cut and weld.....
I'll leave that up to you.

&gt; I'd be running a T4 engine, and have been looking at matching it with
&gt; a baywindow tranny. Here's my thoughts so far.
&gt; I'm guessing to use a
&gt; late 70's 091 tranny with maybe an early bay bell-housing. This would
&gt; seem to allow more room for the engine while giving the higher
&gt; gearing.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think anyone on the list has done this. I havn't located
&gt; anyone on the net at other places that have done this. But I do know
&gt; it HAS been done. I met a guy on the road once who did it and
&gt; everything looked nice. Unfortunatly I only had about 10 minutes to
&gt; talk and look at his bus. But it was stock looking and really cruised
&gt; on the highway. Seems like a nice beefy way to go. Especially with a
&gt; big T4 engine.
