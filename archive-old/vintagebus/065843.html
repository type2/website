&gt; &gt; I managed to bend the tab, but have not managed to move the clip at all.
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; am trying to move it the correct way - anyone got any ideas on how to 
&gt; &gt; remove them?
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Hmm, are you sure you are attacking the wider side of the slide on 
&gt; locks/clamps?

Hi, thanks for your help.
I am definately hitting the wider end,  I assume it must of just rusted
solid.  Have attacked it with PlusGas so hopefully that will help.  Don't
think I can use heat as that will wreck the rubber mount - not sure if thats
available.

&gt; &gt; Next question is about the torsion leaves - should I remove the grease
from
&gt; &gt; them or just bag them up as they are whilst the beam is powdercoated?

&gt;Leave them greased for now.  They are a higher carbon steel so will rust 
&gt;easily if not coated with grease.

Before replacing them in the beam should I do anything to them?

&gt; &gt; Last question now - I disconnected the link that goes from the steering
box 
&gt; &gt; to the swivel pin at the swivel pin end.   However the link has a lot of

&gt; &gt; side to side movement - I can push it into and pull out from the
steering 
&gt; &gt; box quite a distance - is this normal?

&gt; Hmm, not sure what you are talking about there.  You might want to look at

&gt; the bus parts manual on the Obsolete AC Documents website for proper 
&gt; nomenclature.

I will have to look later for that.

Thanks
Paul
