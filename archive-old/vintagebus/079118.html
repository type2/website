Subject: Re: [VB] RE: oil temp.

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I use modified type-3 cool tin in place of the original little diversion
&gt; pans.

Jake Raby did back to back tests, and found higher head temps when the Type
III tin was used on a T I motor.

It's hard to argue when the same load (dyno) is put on the same motor, in
the same atmosphere conditions, and the only change made was the addition of
those tins. The Type III is a different cooling system, and it's not that we
can really expect cooling pieces from that motor to cool our motors better
than what VW did. We have to remember, VW had those Type III tins avalaible
to use on the T I at the same time, but still chose to run the regular flat
cylinder piece.

One test is worth a thousand theories.
Just something to think about.
