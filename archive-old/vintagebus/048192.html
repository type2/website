Hi Ric,
If the oil is leaking from or near the oil cooler inside the fan shroud.  
This oil is going to be blown by the cooling air anywhere the air goes.  This 
means over the cylinders/heads (Yuck!) and out any cracks in the engine tin.  
Looks like you need to strip it down to a long block.  Plug the 
intake/exhaust ports in the head and take the engine to your local wash rack 
to degrease it.  Then reinstall the heater boxes, exhaust system and carb, 
intake manifold.  While leaving off all the cooling tin and generator/cooling 
fan.  With a spare tranny out of a VW or a portion of a tranny bellhousing 
mount a starter, a battery and a small fuel can to the engine and start it up 
to run for only five minutes to see the oil leak location.    Eric&amp;Barb
