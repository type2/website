Subject: pre '68 tow hitch at BNNTA

I will have one of my custom reciever style tow hitches at the Busses
Nowhere Near the Arch campout over labor day weekend if you would like to
see one.  This hitch replaces the stock bumper brackets, puts the pulling
and tounge weight back to the torsion and braces up the rear frame of the
bus.  

I have been getting good reviews from everyone who has seen them.  Sorry,
still haven't had the time to put up any pictures, I'm not sure I want to
advertise too much since I really don't want to make too many of these, they
do take a lot of machining and welding time.  I may make 1 or 2 per month if
time permits. 

Look for the gold westy with the white Scamp in the Buskatier's section.
