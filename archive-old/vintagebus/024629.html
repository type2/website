E and B, you guys are of course, correct again.
I was thinking about that later, and the &quot;aa&quot; cylinder is the one that
goes into the later US spec buses that DID take a servo.  The adapter
thingy is to take up the space where there would have been a servo in a
later aplication.
The one for the non-servo bay bus ( US 68-70, otherplaces in the world
later still, probably still in Brazil) is the 211-611-019 T. It is not
cheap either. But the 211-611-019 AA is the one to go with for the
reasons Eric and Barb point out.

&gt; Hi Jack,
&gt; Actually the master cylinder to use for this is the 1971 and later bus mater
&gt; cylinder.  This will fit the 1955-67 bus and you can use a rabbit MC reservoir
&gt; or the 1967 only bus MC.  Both of these reservoirs allow refilling the MC
&gt; through the floor plate in the bus floor just like stock.  The 1968-70 MC can
&gt; not be hooked up directly to any reservoir we know of, so one has to plumb the
&gt; remote 1968-70 reservoir some where inside the cab of the bus.  Which means
