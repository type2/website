 I had a little trouble with second gear. Tranny grinds going into it. 
 If I'm REAL carefull and baby it into 2nd with low RPM's and slow 
 smooth shifting, it's fine. So is this an old bus thing? Or do I need 
 to start saving for a tranny while this one is wearing out?

it shouldnot be like that.   you could try adjusting the shiufter and see if 
that helps.   Or you could save for a tranny.    You said you had changed the 
gear oil.
