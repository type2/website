Hail all ye Transported Ones..

Using the Harbor Freight $40 portable sandblaster, I have created a blasting
cabinet for cleaning/blasting small bus bits, and I think that it works
quite well.  After some experimentation, I've decided to blast my jalousie
windows with #90 sand and polish to a &quot;medium&quot; sheen, and then seal with
POR-15 &quot;Glisten PC&quot;.  I don't think that going for full polish on the frames
would be worth the effort...

Ronnie:  This particular siphon-fed blaster is great &quot;for the price&quot;.  Its
portability and relative cheapitude balance out the fact that when the sand
gets near the bottom (about 1/4 full) you have to jiggle it to get a good
flow.....my next blaster will be pressurized....but I'll keep this one
around....
