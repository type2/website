&lt;&lt; As you may remember, I recently purchased a '54 Single Cab.  It had Bug
long
 axles and brakes in it.  I traded the axles for a set of Big-nut
 axles/reduction boxes/brakes, all off a running Bus, so they are good.
 After discussion with a few listees, it appears the best match for my
 Barndoor front brakes would be a set of small nut axles and reduction boxes.
 Anyone got a good used set they want to trade for big-nut axles or sell?
 I'd prefer it to be in my area (Phoenix, AZ).  I need a 6-volt transmission,
 too, but may decide just to go for a new one in that area.  (Possible listee
 discount somewhere?  :)  So, basically, I need a good-running entire
 rear-end...
 
 If anyone has any feedback on how small-nut axles/brakes do or do not match
 up against a Barndoor front end, let me know.  The diameter of the drums
 appear to be equal at approx. 9&quot; but I do not want to jeopardize safety.
  &gt;&gt;
The best thing would be a barndoor rear end. The reduction gearboxes bolt on
differently.   They have 1.40 gears in them.  The later small nut (1.39 gears)
have the smaller brakes and are closer to the b/d set up than the big nut
(1.26 geared) reduction boxes.

Another question is boltonability.   I have seen a later rear end ina
barndoor, but am not sure how it was done.   And it had no rear shocks.   So,
start looking for a pair of barndoor reduction gear boxes is my advice.
