Subject: Re: [VB] Westy rear hatch screen


From: &lt;HOT64VW_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Hi just wondering if anyone knows what year buses the rear screen fits, its
&gt; the type that the material is cut to go around the hatch hinges, I think
&gt; maybe 64 and later but not sure until what year. Thanks Doug Lewis

As far as I know, the bug/insect screen was a bay window item starting in 68.

Was it ever offered in split buses?!?

I have a few extra bay screens.... I have a 67 camper.... I know the rear hatch
seals fit 64 to 71.... I need to get some snaps and screws and see if it will
work....
