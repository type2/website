&gt; one of my volkswagens suffers the same oil-slinging-from-the-pulley problem.  the engine did this from newly rebuilt.  better venting helped but did not stop the oil from making its way past the pulley.  my guru suggested that i get a press-in sand seal and associated pulley.  i was on the verge of buying the set up when the parts guru suggested that this approach was like putting a band-aid on a severed appendage - not enough of a solution and the wrong one anyway.  too many gurus....  now i'm back to doing nothing... well, i am driving slower and that seems to help... or maybe the oil level is too low.

Actually with the question &quot;is it a degree pulley?&quot; causes me to ask...
Do the degree pulleys not have the slinger grooves? I kind of wanted to
put one on but if no grooves then I guess not. I had one on a bug once but
dont remember...
