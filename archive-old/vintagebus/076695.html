Subject: Re: [VB] search function page and distributor questions

This brings up a good question.  I've been looking to try something other
than the 009, but don't know what to try instead.  What's the better dizzy
in y'all's opinion?  The 050, 019, or 010?  Thanks.

&gt; Hi List -
&gt;
&gt; 1) I tried to do a search for &quot;009&quot; and &quot;010&quot; and &quot;050&quot; for info on my
question but got nothing for any numbers, what gives? Searching for
&quot;distributor&quot; and &quot;dizzy || dissy&quot; works but not numbers.
&gt;
&gt; 2) _sigh_ I know this is the seminal &amp; annoying question but:
&gt; I have a single port heads on a AS21 brasilian case engine of unknown
origin w/ a new 30/31 pict and a 009
&gt; The 009 has the hestitation blues but works great when running the engine
like an industrial machine ( under load &gt; 200 rpms etc ).  I want to try
another dizzy, what models can I try?
