&gt; The the new drum seal bore is 1 or 2mm. larger than the old VW original

&gt;    Has anyone run into this problem and, if so, how did you correct it?

Hi Duck,
Sounds like you need to contact a local machine shop and have them make two 
ringlike shims to be pressed in there to take up the extra room.

&gt;    Also, does anyone make a reproduction of the tiny clip on the rear brakes 
&gt; that hold the crossbar to the lower spring?

Get out a piece of banding strap, a pair of tin snips, a hammer and chisel.  
Then make your own!  Then drill,tap, and screw these into place.
