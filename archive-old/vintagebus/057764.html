Subject: Re: [VB] Low-down cryin' shame

Remember the movie The Gauntlet with the 4106 GM bus (they have a split
front window) that got ALL shot up well it was restored and now is a
motor home call &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;.  We do not remember how many bullet holes
they said it had but....
It is Friday and another split bus story of a different kind.  Packing
up  to go get the bus for the big red barn.
P &amp; C
two type twos for two and a 4106 split


&gt;  early 50's 21 window delux with slidin rag top
&gt; just sittin there rustin away. It was full of bullet
&gt; holes.  when we get the pics developed, I'll
&gt; post them for all to see.
