&gt; ya, the light is nice! i have a bosch bug accessory backup light
&gt; mounted in my engine bay, with a switch by the batt. has saved my
&gt; bacon many a time when something gets dropped in there at night...


The PO of my DC had installed a mercury switch bulb holder on the inside
of my deck lid.  Its wired to my running lights, so if they are on and
you lift the lid, the light goes on...close it and it goes off.  Just
like your refrig, but no mechanical extra switches...it just works:-)

Are these still available??  A very useful and cool accessory.
