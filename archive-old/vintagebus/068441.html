Hey Sam send me your intinerary. I will be flying out of Phoenix on the 18
transfering somewhere on a plane to Brussels, who knows we might be on the
same flight to Brussels

Clara &amp; I have gotten our tickets using my united miles, great.
I am trying to use up my United miles as quickly as possible, but the
company 
I work for has an agreement with United and they get a 30% discount so I
have 
to fly United inside the US unless I can really show an advantage for
someone 
else.
But you all should know that the really cheap fares still have airport fees
&amp; 
taxes.
Mine from Brussels are $125 and Clara's returning from London are $250 so be

aware that there are costs above the airline charges that can be
significant!
