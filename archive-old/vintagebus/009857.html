Subject: Re: [VB] one year only?



&gt; Today i took the dizz out of the 60 crew cab to replace the points,
&gt; I knew it was unusual, as the cap is shorter than the others I have
&gt; &amp; the points are in two pieces, color of cap is brown. The rotor is 
&gt; smaller too.
&gt; 
&gt; While talking to the shop manager, he was looking up the part #
&gt; for the dizzy, the PO had used a 67 bus engine I knew it wasn't
&gt; a 40hp, just didn't know what year it was till now.
&gt; Seems this dizzy was used one year only in this year bus engine.
&gt; That was I thought unusual.
&gt; 
&gt; Points  # 01009
&gt; cond    #02069
&gt; cap      #03001
&gt; rotor    #04006
 
As soon as I saw the 'shorter' cap, I said to myself ''that is a type3 cap''.
So I looked up the #03 001 cap you listed.
It is a lot more then one-year-only:
65-68 type1
64-68 type2
66-73 type3

What is your distributor #?
