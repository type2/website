&gt; He wasn't cruising at 90 mph in 3rd gear so I wouldn't hold him responsible
&gt;  for anything.  It probably would have blown up next time you drove it 
&gt; somewhere
&gt;  of distance.  I say guilt him into being your engine rebuild bitch-slave
&gt;  or the cash/trade equivalent of that.

Thanks for the insight.  I dont really want much from him but a helping hand 
would be nice.  He offered to pony up some money to help out some which I 
wasn't going to decline.  I dont hold this against him and it should be fun 
putting it together with him.

The engine had been gone through 6 months ago with just under 2000 miles on 
it.  Mostly all new parts used.  It very well could have happened on the next 
trip with me or my brother.

Thanks again for letting me know where i stand.

P.S.    I wasnt trying to find out ways to get money out of him, I just 
wanted to           make sure that neither of us step out of line, him or me, 
 and end up fighting        and all that.
