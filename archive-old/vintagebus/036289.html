 skipped that remark, help??? its almost dark! &gt;&gt;
Hi JB,
Until the oil is as high as the lower side of the fill plug hole.  Once the 
oil begins to drip out of there stop adding oil, and wait for three to five 
minutes.  Then add a little more.  If it over fills immeadiately it is full, 
if it takes a minute or two to start dripping again it was not quite full due 
to filling to fast with such a thick oil.  Eric&amp;Barb
