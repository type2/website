Subject: Re: [VB] Trip REPORT- WA to AZ, didnt need those toes
  anyway.(Long)

&gt;....... Obviously you utah guys dont drive your buses enough!

We drive the heck(Utahese for hell) out of them, but not much in the winter
when they salt the roads! I use the Vanagon for winter use! I did take the
DC to the dump last week to get rid of some tree branches that broke off
after Xmas in a huge snow storm-it took a month for it to warm up enuf to
get at the stuff &amp; to want to pull the DC out.

 Lost a grey hubcap in Utah on the
&gt; interstate. So keep an
&gt; eye out in your travels thru there .....

Where'd ya loose it, I need another one!

Cool trip report.  Thanks for taking the time to share it.

Pax,

Tom Buese
