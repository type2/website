Check for vacuum leaks. Is this a dual port? If so it is more than likely
the intake boots.

&gt; &gt; Just got mu 66 panel running (?) again.  Been sitting for a few months (
&gt; don't ask
&gt; &gt;  why).  It will start easly and idle fine.  I can rev it but it has a
bit
&gt; of a stumble up to
&gt; &gt;  about 2,000RPMS.  When I try to drive it, it won't run very well at
all,
&gt; misses and
&gt; &gt;  stumbles and dies.  If I coast to a stop it will return to an idle
&gt; without a problem.
&gt; &gt;  I've replaced the plugs, points,rotor and cap.  Did one of the cheap-o
&gt; rebuilds on the
&gt; &gt;  carb and checked the timing.
