&gt; Alright, my next question on this topic.  Platinum
&gt; is a silverish color.  I 
&gt; am not &quot;anal,&quot; but if I order the platinum seat
&gt; cover set from Wolfsburg  West or TMI (same thing
I've heard), am I going to get a seat cover with gold
skirts? 


Yes. Or pretty close to it.


 In this case, would it be wiser to
&gt; simply order the mesh grey  set, as it almost seems
to &gt; be a closer match.

Just order WHAT YOU LIKE!

These days, everyone pretty much recognizes the WW
&quot;Platinum mesh&quot; as a platinum mesh interior.

While the grey mesh might be closer to it's correct
original color. Maybe the &quot;platinum mesh&quot; from WW is
closer to what you want in your interior?

Bottom line is do what you like.

Both will look pretty sweet I imagine.
