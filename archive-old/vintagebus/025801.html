It worked!

As I had told earlier, both drums on my &quot;new&quot; tranny were stuck to the
axles, and one was frozen to the brake shoes (I hoped). I made
&quot;easy-bake&quot; ovens for each drum, using cardboard, aluminum foil, and
100-watt light bulbs, and soaked them with WD-40. I left the ovens on
all last night and all day while I was at work...

When I got home, I removed the ovens, and the drums were so hot I had to
use rags to handle them. Sprayed both drums liberally with WD-40,
smacked them around a bit with a hammer, then attached a wheel to each
one. Pulled on the wheel with one hand and hammered the axle with the
other hand, dosing liberally with WD-40...

Both drums are off and both axles are turning properly. 

Time to work on the stuck shifter... I'm guessing that I will have to
remove the engine and tranny again, take off the nosecone and work on
the shifter parts with some more WD-40... 

I'd love some advice/criticizm/encouragement from you old gurus out
there...

P.S. Thanks, Bob!
