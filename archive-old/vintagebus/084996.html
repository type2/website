Subject: Re: [VB] What to do?

Hi Seth,
We would replace the pushrod.  After making sure ALL the pushrods  are the 
correct length.  What you are looking for is halfway through the  lift of the 
pushrod the valve adjusting screws and the valve stems are parallel  to each 
other.  Doing this minimumizes the rocker pushing the valve stem  too much 
sideways into the valve guides.
  Once the engine is back together see if all four cylinders are  firing and 
do a compression check to see if the fuel laden cylinder was  damaged.
  It is a good idea to have at least $1000.00 in savings to  help cover the 
eventual engine, tranny, or other large VW expense that will  happen sooner or 
later....
