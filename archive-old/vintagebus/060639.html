&gt;&gt;please let me know if you have a straight lower torsion bar you can sell me

Hi Conrad,
There are only two torsion bars in a VW and they are in the rear suspension.  
There are two sets of leaf torsion springs in the front.  Our best guess is 
you might be talking about the trailing arms on the front suspension that 
there are four of.  You might check your VW bus shop manual or the bus parts 
manual through vintagebus_dot_com and figure which you are requesting!
