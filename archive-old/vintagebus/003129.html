&gt;&gt;I am hoping to build a garage this spring and I was getting quotes for
concrete. they told me i should pour 3 inches and not 2 inches.  Also they
talked about putting fiberglass in the concrete instead of using rebar. Any
one have advise about pouring concrete garage floors?
Thanks,  Kevin Sullivan

Hi Kevin,
I was just about to put a floor in my old garage in the fall and decided to
wait for spring due to weather.  I was looking at least a 4 inch slab with
re-bar for mine.  Several people told me that if the slab is only for light
vehicle traffic, 4 should do fine but if you ever bring a dump truck on to
it, don't be surprised if it breaks (I was looking at doing both the floor
and a 40 foot long driveway).   No one suggested to me to use the
fiberglass... only rebar.


David
