Subject: RE: [VB] Underdash gas heater question

Any chance of getting some pics of these set ups for those of us who have
never seen either one in a sc or dc?

Thanks,

Thomas

That's an interesting point, because there are two
doublecabs here in my shop.  Barry's '63 has the
underdash unit (he just got it running, so no reports
from passengers yet), and my '61 DC had a heater in
the engine compartment w/ factory holes in the gas
tank bulkhead piece and the rear seat stand for
ductwork.
