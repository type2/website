&gt; Yeh, I'd love to see that list...as well as where you put it all!!! You
&gt; know, I can hardly afford to buy the stuff the first time for my bus...I
&gt; can't imagine buying it all again for spare!
&gt;

Believe me, that ain't how you get a road pokey like that. It takes years to
accumulate, but the first secret is it can't help if it is home in the
garage. I pick up stuff at swaps and find a place in the bus to put it. Not
like there is room in the garage anyway. When the Westfailure is outfitted
for a road trip, I would imagine there is close to 500 pounds of stuff that
will fix almost any bus but the Westfailure. Hell, I've had a couple of wide
five spares on the roof rack since Havasu, and they sure won't work on it.
My spare battery has taken an alternate route home a couple of times now. I
don't know how many 009 dizzies I've lost. I keep a tuned one in the ammo
can, and plunk it in for any seeming ignition problems on the broken bus. If
it fixes it I wave goodbye at it. Can't recall anyone returning a roadside
repair part, other than the battery, but that's okay too. Good busma, I say.
There'll be another along shortly.
