	&gt; The switch keeps hanging up too much. Any 
&gt; &gt; info on modern upgrades? Thanks
&gt; 
	All the switch does is momentarily ground the headlamp relay. The
relay is like an electric see-saw, and toggles between high and low. I
opened mine up cuz I couldn't figure it out. It has a spring loaded latch in
there that stays on high or low even after power is removed. That's why your
highbeams are on the next time you use your headlamps. Anyway, you could
replace the turn signal switch with any momentary contact, normally open
push button switch. Connect one contact of the switch to ground, the other
to the &quot;S&quot; terminal on the relay. Should click the relay.

	&quot;Is that a 6 volt spectrophotometer, or a 12 volt?&quot;
