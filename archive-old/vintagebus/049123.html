List:

Has anyone ever tried mounting an antenna on the undercarriage of a bus?  I've been lead to believe that Mercedes and a few other auto makers in earlier times did this on occasion, primarily due to cosmetic reasons.  I've also been told that reception is compromised that much, if at all.

I'm not sure of what the best place would be on a bus for this, maybe along one of the two main chassis members running the length of the bus?  

Robert
