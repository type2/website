&gt; &gt;Chips from bad bearings that circulate in the oil cause damage to the

&gt;
&gt; Yeah, I've been thinking along the same lines.  Makes sense.  Now I have

&gt; Seems like I saw a website recently where someone had documented their

&gt; Now I can't find it -- anyone know what I'm talking about?
