You'ld probably have to measure them on your tire.  I know I have had
chains
that will fit the 14&quot;s but not the 15&quot; tires.

I saw the video of last years crazy snow camping trip which included
lots of
adventures and is not for the faint heated or those worried about a
scratch
in the paint.  Bring shovels and plywood and someone bring a rope and
a come
a long.
  Too far for me to go.    :(

 Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
 have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
 because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
 were to pick up some chains at a garage sale what are
 the chances that they will fit my 205/70/15's ? Do
 chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
 And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
 unshiney orig paint on my kombi? Anyone else planning
 on going, I know the only list member that went last
 year was Gene, and he is not currently on the list.
