i have an ez  camper, and someone has one fro sale on ebay, after hearing all
the flak about ebay i am not sure what the price for a 'new condtion' brochure
should cost(as i have only been to one vw show, and there wasn't much of a
swap/selling area)

anyone have any ideas?

  I would expect to pay $20-$40 for an original . Yahoo also has an auction, 
sometimes stuff shows up there.
