 How many of you run hose clamps on the gas lines and where?

I put them at every joint.   When I recently rebuilt my engine (it runs
great, but I digress), I replaced the fuel line from the tank to the carb.
I used 6 clamps and about 3 ft of new fuel line.  The guy at the FLAPS (who
is a semi-retired VW mechanic himself) had a good point when he said it is
dumb not to spend 7 bucks (clamps and line) to make sure the fuel is not
gong to spray an engine that by design runs hot (let alone worries about the
loss of the vehicle and possible injury).
