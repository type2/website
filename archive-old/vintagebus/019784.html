Some things just make you shake your head and ask &quot;Why, oh why me?&quot; :-)

Tranny is in the Westy.  Rear brakes: done.  Engine ready to go in.  Front 
brakes almost completed.  But wait!  What's this...?  A puddle.  It's a 
puddle of trans oil.  No, it's TWO puddles of trans oil, one under each wheel!
Under my rebuilt tranny!!!!

Here's what happened.  The PO decided the stock bolts weren't sturdy enough,
and bored the holes wider and longer, and put in some bolts.  Apparently, the
holes were drilled clear through the casing, as trans oil is leaking around 
the bolts, and some bolts when removed are covered in oil.  I have tried 
tightening the bolts down further, using blue Loctite on the threads, using 
Loctite AND teflon tape on the threads, all without stopping the leak.  It's 
better, but it still drips.  I assume the PO drove it like this, and I would 
hope it would be without these leaks (it leaks a good sized puddle overnight).

Any suggestions as to what to try next?  I won't leave it as-is if I can't get
the drips to stop, and will get unmodified casings put on.  But...if there's
a way for this to work, why go through all that effort?  The beefier bolts seem
like a good idea, but the disadvantage of the leaks far outweighs any benefit
IMHO.

FYI, the boxes leak nowhere else.  And it's a '67.
