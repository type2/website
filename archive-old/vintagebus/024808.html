-Snip a little off the top-
&gt; good share of that.   I bleed the front brakes myself, pulling the brake lever
&gt; down with one hand.   As it had been almost a year, I decide to flush the
&gt; system, so I pump it till the reservoir is almost empty, then wipe the
&gt; sediment out with a clean rag, filll it up, and finish the front
&gt; flushing/bleeding. 
&gt;  

-And a little more here-

&gt; and putting stumps in creeks or not as the case may be,  Todd H shows up to
&gt; investigate bumpers, and  agrees to also help bleed the rear brakes,
&gt; hooray!!!!      After  the type of bus gabbing one falls into in the sunshne

A couple comments, having done most of my VW maint. solo over the years.

The things I like about bleeding brakes on the Bus (rather than the
Bug), are that you can get under there w/o jacking it up and pull the
brake pedal lever from underneath when you're working solo (cool!). I
won't argue against the value of having a partner to work the pedal
while bleeding the rear (and to BS about VWs with), I often don't have
that luxury. In these cases, I tie a rope to the brake pedal lever and
work it from the back of the bus... it's a little awkward, but it works.
Tie it where the pedal shaft bolts to the lever, so you get the
leverage.

Right now my 7 year old son is psyched about helping, so I've got an
assistant. Before he grows out of it, I think I'll try to set up to
pressure bleed the brakes, 'cause I'll be working solo again until the 3
year old daughter is ready!

One other thing; somethin' I read or was told a long time ago, was to
always start bleeding the longest run from the MC and work toward the
shortest (ya know, rt. rear to lft. frt.). I have been a mindless slave
to this command, never questioning whatever authority it was that handed
down this edict. Here, you weren't after air bubbles per se, but
flushing the system, but you started at the front. So I wonder if the
order makes any difference. Is it different for bleeding air vs.
flushing? Have I been a sheep, following without questioning, this
instruction? If I have been a sheep, does that mean I've been _bleating_
the brakes? (Oh gawd, that was BAAAAD! :)

Bye for now,
Paul Doubek
