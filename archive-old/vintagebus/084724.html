Russell nice job on the 'raising of the roof'.
About your donor bay, where are the turn signals, what year, english bus???
P &amp; C

The turn signals were in the high position next to the vent but were moved
into the headlights by drilling the reflectors an riveting in bulb holders,
orange bulbe were fitted.  It was a 1972 converted RHD panel van,
2132044009.  Imported I believe as it was first registered in the UK in
1982.  Unfortunately it was really rusty, so I had no hesitation in breaking
it.
