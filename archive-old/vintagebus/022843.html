Subject: '60 DD Progress - now *this* is work!
Mime-Version: 1.0


Last night after I got home from work I started color-sanding the panel.
In about 5 hours, I did everything except the nose (which I'm saving for
last) and part of the roof with 1500, 2000, and 2500.   

Hint: when you buy sandpaper, don't do the onesy-twosey BS - buy the whole
dang box.  A box of 25 8x11 1500 cost me 20; 50 4x8 (approx) sheets of 2000
- $22; 50 4x8 sheets of 2500 - $25.  Individually, they cost ~1.10, ~.75,
~.85 a sheet singly, respectively.

Today I took a break from color sanding and disassembled and painted the
front window assemblies.  Another hint: don't bother trying to kroil and
remove the 4 inner assembly screws.  Drill 'em out at the get-go and save
yourself the hassle.

So, it appears that the yellow painting is done.   Now I just have to paint
the shifter, pedals, knobs, steering column, (all black) and gas tank
(grey) and assembly can begin.  You read that right - I removed pedals,
shifter, steering box, etc, and dismembered the airbox.  It made it a LOT
easier to paint.  And a LOT more work to reassemble...

As an interesting note, I had some spray cans made up using the paint code,
even took the empty paint can in.  Guess what?  They couldnt' match it.
But what the *did* come up with is more in line with what I *thought* the
color was going to be.  Analysis?  I think they shanked the original order,
and either mis-mixed the formula, or used the wrong formula altogether.
The color I *thought* I'd picked *is* more muted, more &quot;white&quot; in it, so
it's not so dang flashy.  Oh well.
