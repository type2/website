Subject: Dcab airboxes and louvres?
Message-ID: &lt;DFD1EF94802BD21181C50060080B9D8F25555A_at_LIMONFS&gt;

Hello list,

Anyone know when the airboxes at the rear of the side gates on
doublecabs were dropped? Mine is a '60 and had both the gate mounted
airboxes(they feed through slots in the bed into the top of the engine
bay above the wheel arches) and the louvres in the rear quarter panels.
