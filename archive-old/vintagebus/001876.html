Well the time has come for me to buy a splittie.
I sold my 1970 semi restored westy over the weekend so
I am in the market for a pre 67. I would prefer a camper but I am open to
anything including a crewcab. I am located in Delaware (East Coast)
but I am willing to travel across country for the right bus. I would like it
to be
as solid as possible. Not real interested in a project right now. My budget
is in the
4-6k range. Please help me I am having type 2 withdrawal.
 Thanks,
 Dave Parsons
