Subject: Re: [VB] Shipping Front Doors ***

UPS has some funky rules with thier shipping.

If the item is not in a box, they will add an additional $5

If the length is over 60&quot;, they add $5
If the width is over 30&quot;, they add $5

Little things like that.

I agree with Eric and Barb, Greyhound is a great way to ship large items.
That's how we ship large items like hoods, fenders, pan halves, etc.
