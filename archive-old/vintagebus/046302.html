&lt;&lt; I've got a 1600 dp w/ a 34 pict3 carb and I want an oil bath air cleaner

 it--- We all know they work best in everyday stock conditions, but I was 
wondering 
 what year bus oil baths will work? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
If you are not going to drag race it the stock air cleaner from 1959 on will 
work fine.  We are using a 1961-63 bus/KG one with 20/20Wt oil in it due to 
our cooler weather and possibly helps with the smaller air cleaner with the 
1641cc SP engine in our 1960 WT camper conversion panel.  The main focus when 
changing type of air cleaner, muffler type, or even engine compartment the 
engine is installed in is the carb jetting!   Eric&amp;Barb
