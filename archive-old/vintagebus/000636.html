&lt;&lt; That's strange.  The one that I'm looking at right now is a Sapphire V. I

 this one would be late...except the bus is an early 67...oh well.  It is an

 only and is 12V.  It is most definitely original to the '67 hard top

 I removed it from which is in the drive.  The radio looks like most of its

Hey Steve,

Please do me a favor. If you come across ann extra Sapphire for a '67 in your 
travels, let me know. It doesn't have to work. I just need something that's 
&quot;original&quot; to fill the hole (for looks only). I already have a modern sound 
system installed.

Thanks

Jerry Dasson
