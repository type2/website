Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning headlining

Simple Green is a sort of all purpose cleanser.  It is biogradable, smells 
nice, and is available at hardware stores etc here in the US.   When I took 
the front seat out of my '61 and cleaned it with simple green and a scrub 
brush the seat became slightly more supple.   I spray it in the engine 
compartment before washing to get the grease off.  Works great.  Dunno if 
they have it in the UK

&lt;&lt;  Simple Green - what sort of product is that?
