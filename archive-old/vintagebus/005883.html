At home in San Diego it takes 3 to 5 seconds to load samba, but when I was
in Stuttgart  two weeks ago it took a while

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why does Everett's page load 10 times faster than Thom's.  I look at
&gt; them at home (28.8 ughh!) and from work (T1) and its the same from both
&gt; places, although the T1 is naturally faster than my dial up, Everett's
site
&gt; is signifiacantly faster than Thom's.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; I'm assuming you mean the main page?
&gt;
&gt; According to http://websitegarage_dot_netscape_dot_com/ (neutral 3rd party)
vintagebus_dot_com
&gt; is faster, although we both have crappy load times according to them.  It
&gt; said vintagebus_dot_com had more &quot;HTML errors,&quot; I don't know if that slows
down
&gt; a browser or not.
&gt;
&gt; On a basic level, vintagebus_dot_com will load faster because it has less to
&gt; load on the main page - I have 1 more frame, more little icons, etc..
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, network traffic can vary widely, after repeated cache clears, it
&gt; took from 2-30 seconds to do thesamba_dot_com/vw (froze on the top factoid)
&gt; and from 2 sec-1 min to do vintagebus_dot_com (froze on the menu).  This is
&gt; my work where I think we have a bunch of T1s.
&gt;
&gt; I have had people tell me my site is real fast compared to others, no
direct
&gt; comparisons were made.
&gt;
&gt; My site runs out of San Diego but proximity across CA should not be a
variable.
