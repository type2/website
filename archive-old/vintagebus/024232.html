many people wrote via p-mail:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure many would like to know the name of that certain company, after all you
&gt; were just relating your own experience right?

And a couple thought it's be a good thing to post the company's name
here on the list.  I thought about it.  I haven't yet decided if I'm
going to bother with them at all any more as this isn't the first
negative experience I've had with them.  I ordered another item from
them after this engine, received the wrong part, and the company wanted
nothing to do with making a REASONABLE effort to make good on the part
and shipping.  For now, let's just say they're out of Tucson Az and
advertise in VW Trends with a full page yellow ad.   I wouldn't have
bought the engine normally but I had a need and severe time constraints.

Dave
