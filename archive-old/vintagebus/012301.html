Charlie Ford called me the other evening and broke the horrible news about
our loss of Josh.  I, like many of you, am stunned to say the least.

After reading many interesting and informative posts from Josh on the Bus
Lists over the years, I finally met Josh at Busses By the Arch #12.  While
running the event, I seldom get much time to stop and really meet a lot of
the attendees.  But for some reason, I was lucky enough to get to talk with
Josh while he, I , Charlie and a few others were watching for party
crashing locals on that Friday night.  In just moments, our conversation
skipped the superficial and got both fun and serious.  He was easy to talk
with.  And Ken is so right about those piercing eyes.  He was a handsome
man who really liked people, and loved Busses.

I last saw him this Sept at BBTA#14.  After I had finished conducting the
Sat. night Awards ceremony, my work at the event was pretty much done, and
I was ready to catch up on the partying going on in the DBG tent / bar at
the event.  I spent the evening with a few DBG guys, Henry DeKuyper from
&quot;Trends&quot; and Josh.  After several brews, I realized that Henry, Josh and I
had been talking for hours about life, relationships, Busses and our
friends.  We looked around and we were the only ones left and it was almost
4am.   Josh was an easy guy to be with, and although I didn't know him for
that long, I will surely miss that warm smile at the next BBTA.  

Josh, you will be missed!  Be at peace.
