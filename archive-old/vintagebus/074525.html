Subject: Re: [VB] leaky carb

the plug must be coming loose.   clean it up, mix up some JB weld and seal it 
up.  before it falls out and runs really crappy.   you can get artsy and 
stick things in the jb weld if you like.  (or not)

I wasn't sure from your despcription, but if the shaft the accelerator arm on 
is worn, it can start leaking out the ends there.    If that is happening you 
need to get the carb rebushed, or a new or other carb.  But I'd do the jb 
weld and see how it goes from there.  

of course, you have a fire hazard going on now.

&lt;&lt; While going through the motor that came with the dc, I noticed there  
 was a light mist of gas forming on bottom end of carb, and going about  
 an inch down the manifold.  I tightened the nuts, wiped it off, and it  
 seemed to stay dry.  After a couple of hours,  I started playing with  
 the throttle, and noticed that as I pulled it down, gas immediately  
 appeared on the surface of a small round &quot;plug&quot; directly in front of  
 me, and on both sides of carb on the nuts at the end of the shaft that  
 the throttle pivots on.  I let it sit overnight, and this morning, it  
 was back to the light mist forming and spreading down the manifold,  
 plug was dry, and bolts were dry. (until I rocked throttle again)
 
 I've included a link to a couple of pic's I took, and a short movie(let  
 me know if it works) of what happens when I pull down on the throttl &gt;&gt;
