Subject: Volkswagen of America Donates 25 Eurovans to the New York City Fire Department

Volkswagen of America Donates 25 Eurovans to the New York City Fire
Department
September 21, 10:00 - NEWS: Volkswagen of America, Inc. is handing over 25
new EuroVans to the New York City Fire Department, to help the families of
the firefighters who lost their lives responding to the terrorist attack on
the World Trade Center, as well as to assist the department as it carries
out its vital day-to-day responsibilities.

Volkswagen will begin loaning the EuroVans, a mid-size van that provides
abundant space for people and cargo, to the NYC Fire Department beginning
this weekend. All vans will be specially prepped and equipped by the
Department's vehicle administration services, with such items as short-wave
radios, sirens, and logos.

&quot;Volkswagen of America, Inc. was born in Manhattan in the 1950s and we
continue to feel a strong tie to the Greatest City in the World,&quot; said Gerd
Klauss, President and CEO, Volkswagen of America. &quot;We hope this donation of
EuroVans helps in some small way to make the lives of the firefighters and
their families a little easier in this time of great need. This is just the
beginning of our company's commitment to help, as Volkswagen AG in Germany
has committed to the establishment of a Foundation to help victims of this
senseless violence.&quot;

On Monday, the employees and management of the Volkswagen Group decided to
create a Foundation to assist victims of terrorist attacks in the United
States. The Foundation will be funded initially with $2 million dollars (US)
from Volkswagen.

The purpose of this Foundation is to extend humanitarian help to the
children of the families that have been traumatized by last week's terrorist
attacks in the United States. This will include medical and psychological
assistance as well as rehabilitation and scholarships.

And since this isn't a Friday post I am sure that they wanted Splitties
