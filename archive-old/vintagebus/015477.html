Well, sorta; in the same sense that there's a seal between the engine
and the ground...

There's a round plug in the back of the box, which in your case appears to
need to be re-sealed.  Make sure that that's where the leak is really 
coming from, and that it's not from the actual axle seal inside the drum.

&gt; seal that goes between the reduction boxes and the spring plates? After
