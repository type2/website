Subject: [VB] Are Westy + Sundial side windows the same ??
Message-ID: &lt;0.3b56cefd.257c9e1e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I was looking at some campers today and it looks like the Westy + Sundail 
windows were the same, these were 66-67 buses.
Could that be possible ?  the louver windows

It seems weird that the Germans would use USA windows
or that Sundial would import German windows.

Anyone have both to compare ?????
