In fourth gear, with a stock 1500 (or 1600 or that matter),
you CAN NOT go to fast. They where made to run WOT all day
long.

&gt; Well, I've seriously tried to follow the whole gear ratio thread to see if
&gt; I can glean what the 1500 engine and '67 tranny in my 63 camper is turning
&gt; when I'm between 60 and 65mph.  No joy...this is why I'm an english major!
&gt; :D  On the freeway I really don't take it much over 60...sounds like it's
&gt; running too high at 65.  Can anyone give me some numbers?
