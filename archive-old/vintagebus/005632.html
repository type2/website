Well, the local VW mechanic and his assistant say that I'm going to be
fine.....so there's some valve, lifter, and cam gear noise...what of it?   I
guess I'll have to drive it up to the snow to find out!  I tried to pack
light, but ended up with a full under seat and rear seat....enough to live
outback if need be, or otherwise just have fun.  I decided that this would
be a &quot;photography mission&quot;, so I brought a cheap panoramic camera, a point
and shoot with zoom 35mm, a Canon AE-1 35mm in its bag with three lenses,
filters, and a lot of etc..., a mount for the Canon to stick onto my Meade
ETX Astro for some long-range stuff, the telescope's tripod, the ETX itself,
my good ol' camera tripod, two toolboxes full of tools and stuff, 5 gallons
of water in case my radiator leaks, a large coffee pot and propane burner
for making cowboy coffee, and a handheld CB, with which I can hear my
distributor working.  I also have a bunch of other stuff, including a
floorjack, plywood to make it useful, some 2x4's, 2 1-ft 4x4's, and some
tire chains.  Did I mention that I am still carrying around 4 60-lb bags of
concrete for ballast?

So I'm going to get up tomorrow morning at 2:30 or so, make some wicked
coffee, and head out to my mom's to pick up mu uncle....then to Brian's,
where we leave for Shasta starting with a back road called &quot;Sweetwater
Springs Road&quot;, which winds northeasterly from Guerneville to the Healdsburg
area or somewhere like that.  Then it's onward and upward to Shasta via as
many backroads as possible without getting stuck.  More later....

I hope I get some Yeti or Sasquatch footage!

&gt; my camper motor sounds a bit loose &amp; rattly when I start it when its cold.
&gt;  when the motor is warm or the outside temp is warm, not, just when cold.
&gt; also makes a sound right about 3K which I think is the fan rubbing at
certain
&gt; engine speeds.    and bla bla bla it seems they all have noises the thing
is
&gt; to tell whether they are okay noises or noises to stop driving for.
&gt; each has it's own.
