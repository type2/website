Subject: Re: 6V vs 12V

I wanted to keep my bus a 6v bus. I count on my bus to get to work every

day and we drive across country. After waiting as much as a week for 6
volt parts ( here in Dallas) when I needed the bus the next day, I
realized that if I was going to drive the bus across country that we
couldn't wait that long for parts if something went out and we were in
the middle of no where. So I finally broke down and made the switch.
This already has paid off for us when we were able to pick up a starter
in an autozone in the middle of nowhere and install it at the next rest
stop. I very seriosly doubt that we would have found a 6v starter. So it

really depends on what you are going to use the bus for.
