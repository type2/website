Heh Heh - I knew it was coming.  The city is doing Big Brother sweeps of the
residential neighborhoods targeting the owners of &quot;junk vehicles.&quot;  I got
another letter today from them and man, they are getting agressive.  They've
not only targeted my 67 but they've targeted my brother's bug in the
backyard.

The police have been here so many times in the past 3 years I've lost track.
It peeves me a bit that they notified me that I must remove the &quot;VW Bug
under cover in back yard by April 3rd.&quot;  It's not a junk vehicle under their
own definition - it runs, is tagged, and is insured.  So convinced was I of
their error, that I drove the bug down to the police station to prove my
point and had a nice long chat with Sargeant Scholl.

They've got me pinpointed as evidenced by the officer's knowledge of my red
bug and the VW Bus &quot;sitting on blocks.&quot;  Well now for one day, I had the 66
on blocks in the backyard to take its tires to put on the 67 and they're
talking like I store the bus on blocks all the time.  Geesh.  I proceeded to
tell the officer that it was my intention to insure and license the 67
within the 30 days allowed by law which is March 27th.  So he wrote up a
variance and I succeeded in getting 5 days knocked off my alotted time frame
before a citation was issued.  Great.

Anyway, I spent about 2 hours at the library today combing the city
ordinance book and the newspaper over the past 2 months and found out this
info:

A vehicle is considered a junked motor vehicle if it has not been registered
for 30 days and has been on your property for more than 30 days.  The bus
has been here for 2 weeks and they issue me a warning.  I think I need to go
back down there and tell them to issue the warning after the violation has
been committed - they've jumped the gun this time because, as I later found
out, they think that this bus is the 66.  When the officer questioned me
about &quot;where the white one was&quot; I merely stated that it is in an enclosure
(as allowed by law.)  After I got home from the library, I saw a cop car
drive by the house very slowly so they are looking for the other one I guess
(which they ain't gonna find it.)

Funny twist to all of this is that Cheif Lang said in the paper that 'stock
cars and race cars are exempt.'  Guess I need to put numbers and sponsor
stickers on the side of the bus. :-)

I'll keep you all posted...
