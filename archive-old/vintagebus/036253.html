&lt;&lt; Does anyone have an ability to decipher a &quot;L&quot; code (or is it &quot;F&quot;?) on the
tumbler of a lock into somehting a lock smith could decipher? &gt;&gt;
Hi, 
If a locksmith does not have the code book he almost probably will not have
the correct key cutter or the proper key holder.  Take your original key to
somewhere else till you find some nice old locksmith who has both the tools
and manuals.  Unfortunitly most VW dealers have gotten rid of those old
obsolete tools for the ACVW and could care less about helping keeping your old
car on the road.  They are more interested in selling you a modern VW that you
have to get rid of 5 years later for less than a third of what you paid for
it.    Eric &amp; Barb
