Subject: Sundial or EZ Camper?

I am trying to find out what type of camper I have (Sundial, EZ, or?). I 
thought that my recently acquired '67 panel conversion (camper) was/is a 
Sundial. I do not know this for sure. I have crank out side windows that 
are supposedly common to both. I also have a cutout on the roof for a 
crank-up (?) air vent similar to those found on travel trailers. The 
cut-out looks like it was done at the same time as the windows but I 
don't know this for sure. The exterior-side attach tent is red and white 
with funny decoration on the edges. I don't know what the decoration is 
called, it is hanging string type of stuff (real technical description). 
I am also missing the cabinet/seat that was directly behind the front 
seat so I cannot describe them. Does anyone on the list know what type 
of camper it is or how I can acquire the information. I am trying to 
restore the camper to stock but I need to learn what stock is.

Thanks for your help,

-Rocky
