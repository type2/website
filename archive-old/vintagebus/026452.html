 You will have problems with the flywheel if you use any 12 volt
starter.  A 6v flywheel is smaller than a 12 volt one, and I don't
belive you can use a 6volt flywheel with a 12 volt tranny.
    I use a 12v starter from an automatic in my 65. The bushing hole was
mutilated by a P.O. and wouldn't hold any bushing. The auto-starter
doesn't need a bushing for support.

    Either get a 12 volt engine, swap the tranny, or start parking on
the tops of hills...
