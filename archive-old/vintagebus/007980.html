Subject: That 1967 Double Cab for sale in Akron OH 
Date: Wed, 14 Feb 2001 19:06:41 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Rich (ricoman97) from the vintagebus list went out of his way for me and
checked on that 1967 double cab in Akron, OH for me and it turns out to be a
68 Baywindow DC.  Rich has photos of it on his photopoint site so check them
out.  It's too far gone for me but according to Rich, it's out in the woods
(like Deliverance) and shows 77,000 miles on the odomter.  They will part it
out but he came away feeling he could get it for the &quot;obo&quot; like the original
ad stated.

It has no engine, good glass, doors hard to open, might even get it for
free.  They didn't want him to leave without taking it I guess or were very
friendly and liked to chat.

I know  if it were around here, I'd be taking it home and looking for ways
to financially benefit myself off of it.  Someone go get it and keep it from
seeing the junkyard.
