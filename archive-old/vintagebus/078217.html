Yes, Curt, but Harbor Freight is just a facade for a chinese importing
company selling throw-away junk and 'tools' that should have never even
been made in the first place. I've seen the crap they sell. My advice re
HF, is go to Sears, buy the US made tool, pay 3 times more, and pass it on
to your grandkids after it has given you a lifetime of good service,
including not destroying the stuff you bought it to work on.
