Subject: GL5 from a horse's mouth

When I realized that ALL my local flaps now carried nothing but GL5 tranny
oil, I went on a panicky search at the local wholesalers... almost bought a
120lb KEG of GL4!

When I finaly found a wholesaler who still had it in buckets, a man behind
the counter came over to talk; he had heard me asking for ANY tranny fluid
that WAS NOT GL5 :)!

First words outta his mouth:  &quot;Do you drive an Audi or a Volkswagen?&quot;  He
was a Pennzoil engineer; he also said &quot;Yeah, he can't use any stuff with
Pennzane&quot; while explaining to the clerks.

Pennzane is Pennzoil's name for whatever chemical it is that makes a tranny
oil 'Limited Slip.' Which is waht GL5 is. He specifically stated that the
gears in Audis and VWs were harmed by this, and they were still getting
back reports on other makes - my old Chevy MIGHT be safe. He recommends
never using Limited Slip formulations on any manual made before 1995, just
to be sure.

Pennzoil's GL3 'Synchromesh' lube even says &quot;safe for yellow metals on the
bottle&quot; so they've known about it for a while.........

Just thought I'd post some solid info; this isn't one of those natural vs
synthetic oil, or boxers vs briefs kinda things - GL5 will eat your tranny!
