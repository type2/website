I was just reading on Ken's Buggy Barn, http://www.w-p-c_dot_com/buggysdda.htm ,
how a vac-advance distributor can give you dramatically better mileage.  I
recently bought a remanufactured one that is supposed to be the correct part
for my '67, but it came without a cap, and the cap I ordered from JC Whipme
was broken in transit (incredibly poor packing job).  Once I locate a cap,
I'm going to try using this to replace the 009 that's on there now.

On a related tangent, I have two 009s: one that came with a red cap and one
with a black cap.  The black one seems to have a lot less overall advance,
which actually works better for me, since for the same total advance at high
RPMs, I get more advance at idle, which helps keep my bus from stalling.  I
have a heck of a time getting enough idle RPMs;  the idle is erratic and the
adjustments on the 34PICT3 don't seem to do anything.  I suspect this might
be because of a non-stock cam installed by P.O.  Anyway, I thought I might
get a better idle with the VA dist.

Mine is also DP 1600, 34pict3 and an extractor exhaust.

&gt; I'm planning on doing some work to the engine in the near future.  It is a
&gt; DP 1600, 34pict3 and an extractor exhaust. Other than the standard
adjusting
&gt; of points, vlaves, timing and mixture is there anything I can do to
improve
&gt; my fuel economy. I'm getting about 18mpg average.
