I am trying to identify a 1/3-2/3 middle seat. It has remnants of tan vinyl
with white piping and sewn pleats. What is confusing is it does not have a
grab bar and does not have screw holes in the tubes were the aluminum bar
ends would go. I thought the aluminum ends were attached by a screw that
goes in the back of the seat. Did they ever make a middle seat without a
grab bar?
