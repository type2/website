Subject: Anyone need a good project bus?

I think I may have finally found a double cab so I want to start advertising
my 67 Westy now.

1967 Westy. EXCELLENT body. Let me repeat EXCELLENT body. Currently mostly
in primer. Has a new cargo lip installed. Later model 67 with reverse lights
and dual circuit. Bus is currently up on jackstands with chassis tore apart.
I have all the new brakes lines hoses, mc etc...for it. It still needs a new
drag link and shocks. Also needs swing axle boots, new redux seals, and
engine and then chassis will be complete. (aside from tires). Body needs
minor, minor work. Some SLIGHT surface rust has started to appear that will
need knocked off, and then paint. I do not, unfortunately, have the
interior. I have the one seat and the water tank and that is it. I do
however, know where a 67 westy parts bus is located with complete interior
and even roof rack. This would make an excellent project for someone
especially if they would like one partially done to finish in time for the
summer. I may accept partial trade, maybe full trade if the deal is right,
but I would prefer cash to help finance my double cab(I haven't talked to
the guy yet, but I have my hopes up). Thanks for reading and please pass on
to anyone you know that might want a nice bus. Happy new year all and happy
dubbin!
