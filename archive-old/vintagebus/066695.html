Subject: RE: [VB] Replacing front window rubber

The tar is to help keep water from getting between the seal and the frame.
Two sizes of string was because I picked two out at Home Depot and was going
to test fit each before using.  In the past I just used what was available
and never had a tear but I'll Follow E&amp;B's advice and use 14 gauge
automotive wire instead.

As an update I didn't get as much time actually doing the job today as I
wanted.  We have the frame mostly stripped in the area where the seal
resides and have removed the rust scale.  I still need to go around the
inside of the frame a little to get rid of some very light scale at the
bottom edge.  All but the bottom 2&quot; of each side and the tops cleaned up
really nice with the wire wheels and one of those sand paper flap wheel
things.  The sanding disks that you can remove by unscrewing from the
mandrel were useless but the sandpaper saved the day after the wire wheels
wore out and the flap wheel was consumed.  I'll be at it again next Saturday
finishing the scale removal and then it's time to blend the edges smooth
before moving on to chemical rust neutralization:)

Regards,

Thomas

Looks like a complete list of materials for the job. How do you use the
Henry's? What are the two sizes of string? How do you use them? Thanks, Dave
