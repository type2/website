I've had good results cleaning all sorts of fabrics, including cotton canvas
and Sunbrella material, using Simple Green.

They have several suggested formulations/dilutions on the jug label, but for
really tough cleaning I just use it straight in a spray bottle.  And it
really nails mildew.  Good to rinse thoroughly with clear water and not let
the undiluted SG sit on the fabric more than a couple of minutes.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I'd just go with the Woolite and warm water. Use the tent and tell
people that you are just &quot;doing it YOUR
way.&quot; =)  &lt;&lt;
