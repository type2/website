I just got back in from the shop and found out that the wiper motor
conversion as detailed on www.acvwjyro_dot_com works!

Here's what I've found out.

(Note:  All wiper motors discussed here are 12 volts.)

The actual &quot;throw&quot;, rather, the travel of the wiper blades is determined by
the arm that hooks to the motor.  This piece in turn, hooks to the 2 wiper
control arms with press fit ball-and-socket type assembly.

The standard beetle throw arm is the shortest of them all.  The Super Beetle
throw arm is a bit longer, and the bay window throw arm is the largest of
the 3.  I assume this is in direct proportion to the amount of window area
that needs to be covered in each pass.  (flat window std., bubble window
super, big momma panoramic bay window bus)

It appears that the splines on all 3 motors (std, super, bay) are the same
thereby one can conclude that any arm will fit on any motor.

The bay window motor is the biggest of them all since, I would assume, it
needs more torque to swing them long wipers around.

The bolt pattern of the motor/transmission assembly is the same - so any
motor will bolt to any frame.

There's a catch but hang on.

I tested all my motors and they all worked (2 std., one super, one bay
window)

I removed the throw arm from the bay window motor and pulled the motor off
of the frame and I replaced it with the super beetle motor (minus ITS throw
arm).  I mounted the bay window throw arm on to the super motor, hooked up
the juice, and it ran.  But here's the catch.

The bay window motor bolt holes on the frame allow the bay window motor to
sit parallel to the frame.  When hooking up the super beetle motor, the
motor has to be tipped so it sits at an angle to the frame - either
clockwise or ccw because the bolt holes are not in the same place on the
super beetle motor.  Since I don't have my split window here, I can't verify
if this will interfere with anything under the dash.  The simple solution to
this is to make a pattern, rotate the pattern, affix it to the frame, mark
new holes, and drill them so the motor sits parallel to the frame again.
Also, the location of the anchor bolt hole (on the motor itself) is changed
when the super beetle motor is attatched.  Even if you redrill new holes,
the anchor point comes up short so you either let the assembly dangle by the
window wiper studs or fabricate a bracket of your own.  This would be done
quite simply with a band of flexible metal with a couple holes drilled in
it.

The whole reason for this is that when you convert from 6v to 12v, you need
to step down the current to the motor.  JCW sells a 30 some dollar switch to
do the job but requires you either drill a hole to mount the switch or
something like that.  The only thing you must do in this case is drill out
your existing wiper stud holes to 3/8&quot; to accept the beefier later bay
window wiper shafts.  True, the super motor isn't as beefy as the bay window
motor but as the www.acvwjyro_dot_com page states, they've been running it this
way for over 5 years.  Plus, I don't think you can even run the full length
wiper anyway.  Instead of running those expensive stock splitty wipers, this
opens up a world of cheaper, more available bug parts one could use -
however, you may consider this sacreligeious, dependant on your views on
stock vs. custom.

But that's a whole nuther story. :-)

Hope this helps some of you.
