Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch return spring/clutch lever questions..... 

E and B,
Bowden cable is new, I have also confirmed most are the same. Tube is intact
to body. This leaves an incorrect clutch arm, or just a tired spring. I
think the latter is the most likely. Is that common? My 'old' trans had much
more 'snap' on the clutch lever arm than this one does, some, but not much.
I am replacing the spring, when i get the damn lever off! Wish I checked
that before trans install! Hindsight= 20-20

Al

But, I don't see a clutch pedal return srping any where. Similar to the
brake
setup?  &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
Duh!  There is no return spring on the clutch pedal we got that mixed up
with
the brake pedal return spring at too late at night!  Sorry about that.
