Subject: wiring

In 59, the wire harness was sheathed in the typical pvc tubing.  I've found
the supplier that the wire werks gets there stuff from but there is no way I
could fathom ordering up a 250 foot spool when all I need is a few feet.  I
begged the guy at the june octo meet to bring me some of the small stuff to
the classic the next day and he reluctantly did but I should have asked for
2 meter of each size he had in stock.  The last time I called and begged he
wouldn't ship just the sheathing to me :-(   And I've gone through MSC,
granger, etc. to no avail.  Anyone else have any suggestions????   Heat
shrink tubing is NOT an option here.



David
