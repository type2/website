&gt;&gt; Clara what do you mean by a loose wire? Any wire in particular to look at? 
&lt;&lt;
Hi Kevin,
We think that Clara means the wiring going from the starter through the front 
wiring and back to the coil.  We did have a simular problem that turned out 
to be the OG six volt coil male electrical tabs were riveted onto the coil.  
One of these riveted areas had loosened and we had to solder to prevent this 
problem.  This caused a very irregular dieing of the engine though and not quite 
like you describe.  Still, could be something to check!
  Yes, try replacing the coil and the condensor on the distributor to see if 
that helps.
  Do not use rubbing alcohol!  It is mostly water and you want the alcohol to 
bond to the water that might be in you gas tank, fuel pump, or carb, but 
rubbing alcohol is aready drowned in water and will not do this!
