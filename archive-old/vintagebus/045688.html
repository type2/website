&lt;&lt; recently i have been getting a nice grind if i try and shift into reverse 
&gt;&gt;

There is another problem we've been seeing here.  Sometimes, the driven plate 
has a large enough hub to interfere with the inner diameter of the plate in 
the clutch assembly that's pushed in by the throw-out bearing (hope that is 
clear).

Check for interference when the clutch is out of the bus by setting the 
pressure plate down and then inserting the driven plate into the 
pressure-plate hub side down, and see that there is clearance.  This sounds 
really confused, but I know what I'm talking about, even if I can't make it 
plain to anyone else.  Anyway, sometimes they rub when the clutch is 
completely depressed.
