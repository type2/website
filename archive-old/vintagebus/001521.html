Listees -

I now realize the problem with the sliders vs. roll windows.  Please excuse
the ignorance of what I was asking.  I only wonder how many of you have
forsaken the original-ness of your splittie to install any other items, such
as replacing the drums with disc brakes (front and/or back), a larger engine
(which would hopefully be installed AFTER the brakes were replaced),
converted to any number of other things like 12v, IRS, Pertronix, Blue coil,
after market mirrors, different drums/discs to accomodate Porsche cookie
cutter rims or other after market rims, added any kind of external oil
sump/cooler combination, or a totally different engine (Corvair, Porsche,et
al) etc.  Get my point?  Just because some of you may not agree with what I
had asked about, don't think I don't like the sliders.  I like them, but
it's not very comfortable driving around in a non-airconditioned vehicle
when it approaches 100 degress fahrenheit with close to 90 percent
humidity - and no air circulation either.  I was looking for a way to get
more air into the cab on days like that which happen frequently here in
Maryland during the summer months.  I did receive some constructive
criticism, like &quot;just remove the sliders altogether on days when you don't
think you'll need them in.&quot;  Perfect, that's exactly what I will do, and
exactly the kind of info I have come to expect from members of this list.
