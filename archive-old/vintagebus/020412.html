&gt; I have mixed emotions about this whole Alaska
&gt; Highway trip thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Because I'm a fully indoctrinated VW bus type I
&gt; would probably be piling
&gt; great heaps of parts and tools into our Westfalia
&gt; before setting out on such
&gt; an epic journey.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet every one of several friends that have made this
&gt; trip over nearly 4
&gt; decades, in all sorts of conveyances including old
&gt; VW buses, never had a
&gt; problem that stopped them in their tracks for any
&gt; length of time.  In early
&gt; years some had tire problems, but carried enough
&gt; spares to keep them going,
&gt; and some lost lights and glass but pressed on
&gt; regardless.
&gt; 
&gt; Six years ago my father-in-law and his wife made the
&gt; journey without any
&gt; special preparation in a late-80s New Yorker
&gt; [basically a pumped up K-car]
&gt; with 200K on the odometer.  Typically for them they
&gt; just up and decided to
&gt; take another long trip, and within a couple of days
&gt; headed out.  The car got
&gt; an oil change and a couple of new tires, and away
&gt; they went.
&gt; 
&gt; They started from Banning CA, made a side trip to
&gt; Kansas to see some
&gt; relatives, drove to Anchorage, and ended their
&gt; journey in Tacoma WA.  Total
&gt; elapsed time:  ten [10] days.  They drove fast as
&gt; usual, and returned with
&gt; many rolls of film exposed out the car window at
&gt; ~80MPH.  They had
&gt; absolutely no car trouble, slept most nights in the
&gt; car to avoid the expense
&gt; of lodgings, and returned complaining that they
&gt; hadn't had time to do any
&gt; sight-seeing.  They were then in their mid-70s.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now a member of WetWesties is en route to
&gt; Alaska in a
&gt; recently-acquired baywindow bus.  She has previously
&gt; made the trip in a
&gt; splitty.  I doubt Susan expects any trouble because
&gt; she keeps her Type 2s
&gt; well maintained but if there is a problem she'll
&gt; deal with it just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; It's almost as if we have some kind of peculiar
&gt; mindset that has us cringing
&gt; in fear of journeying in our VW buses that are,
&gt; mechanically at least, as
&gt; well maintained as the vehicles of our fellow
&gt; travelers.  They have no
&gt; qualms about heading off into the sunset/sunrise in
&gt; their tired old sedans
&gt; or vans, dealing with any problems as they arise but
&gt; probably arriving at
&gt; their destinations unscathed.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it machinery or mindset that makes the difference
&gt; in our approach to
&gt; traveling?  Experience with some folks the past
&gt; couple of years who drive
&gt; VWs long distances, but approach their campers as
&gt; they would a typical US
&gt; vehicle, has me beginning to wonder.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;  However, one should remember that the Alaska
&gt; Highway is rather
&gt; well-travelled.  You're unlikely to be stranded for
&gt; long.  The biggest
&gt; challenge is finding parts for your relatively rare
&gt; vehicle.  With
&gt; telephones and UPS you really needn't worry about
&gt; being stuck for more
&gt; than a few days in any case.  I don't think that I'd
&gt; be any more concerned
&gt; about parts there than I would be on US50 in Nevada.
&gt;  &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt;

outside of Barstow I was standing on that hot desert
freeway trying to make a deal with the tow truck
driver to take me back the 15 miles to barstow for
less than $200 bucks and drop me at a Kragens parts
store were luck would have me find a couple of VW fans
than put my bus back together in the parking lot and
