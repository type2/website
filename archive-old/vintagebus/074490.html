&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently finished painting my '64 kombi.  pics at:
&gt; 
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/jessicaanderson/PhotoAlbum4.html
&gt; 
&gt; but that's not what this post is about.  Now onto getting it put back 
&gt; together...The bus is euro spec (3 wire turn signal, M code plate lists 
&gt; switzerland as original delivery point). I do not have the euro spec 
&gt; headllights, don't want to put up the serious coin to get a set.  US lights 
&gt; are fine with me.   I would like to keep the euro wiring harness that is in 
&gt; the bus but I need some opinions.  Bus will be 12V.  I've read matt roberds' 
&gt; 
&gt; articles in the archives about replacing the 6v relays with 12v to make the 
&gt; turn blinkies work.  The wiring under the dash got painted because I did not 
&gt; 
&gt; take pains to cover it up before paint.  Laziness on my part.  The harness 
&gt; was cut, and only partially pieced back together using one color of wire, 
&gt; wire nuts and crimp connectors (!) by PO just forward of the engine 
&gt; compartment.  Basically it needs a complete going-through.  The way I see 
&gt; it, my options are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Yank harness and replace with readily available US spec harness, kluge 
&gt; together wiring to make 3 wire TS work.
&gt; 2.  Replace with US harness, and go 'Merican throughout (find US TS, 
&gt; taillights, etc.)
&gt; 3.  Yank harness, and replace with a special order euro harness (can someone 
&gt; 
&gt; make one? How much?)
&gt; 4.  Yank harness and fuse block, clean off paint, rebuild rear section using 
&gt; 
&gt; wire from parts bus in town, put back in and rewire according to euro wiring 
&gt; 
&gt; diagram
&gt; 5.  Leave harness in place, clean off paint, rebuild and troubleshoot while 
&gt; in the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm leaning towards #4, but is removing the wiring harness without cutting 
&gt; it in the center a nightmare?  Tips and tricks for removing and 
&gt; re-inserting?  I like the idea of spreading out the whole thing so I can get 
&gt; 
&gt; the big picture, and easily replace all the ends, etc. without folding 
&gt; myself in half to see under the dash.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any smarter ways to get the bus' wiring back into shape?  
&gt; Additional things I need to worry about?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

You think you got problems here in the UK we can only get US spec wiring 
harness. I would go for option 1 its got to be a lot easier to do that here in the 
UK its the most common way of doing it. Mike
