Hello

I am waiting on my new  stock 1600 dp.  I was wondering what dizzy and carb 
combination do you think that i should use?  My old 1500 has a 28 and an 
009.  So i would not mind using the 009 especially considering that I put a 
electronic ignition in it.

On another note I have finally nailed down a date for my Classic roadtrip.  
I will be leaving on June 4 from Michigan.  So if anyone is interested in 
carabusing  I would love the company any or part of the way.

thanks alot
domonic
