  Funny thing is the Kong was in conversation the other day here.  Chris got 
Garp (the dog, a vigorous chewer)  a green Kong that is kinda hexonganal 
instead of round.  Curious as to price comparison, I found some catalog 
(RMMW?) that offered the VW part for about $15.   SO I wonder if you could 
use Kongs on the bus, in a variety of colours too!!  anyone done that?  
Someone saw a VW part lying around the yard a couple years ago and asked if I 
had a dog , which confused me.  didn't know they were actually writing that 
on the label. Cool.

 The other day I bought my dog a toy at the suggestion of the store employee.
 As I looked at it I noticed that it had a very familiar shape, but could
 quite place where I'd seen that shape before.  It's shaped like a 3 tier
 snowman.
 
 As I was reading the tag on it after getting home, it said that it was
 inspired after a VW.  Once I read that it clicked and I went out into the
 garage and found the part that it was modeled after.  It was modeled after
 those rubber bumpers on the trans tubes so it doesn't hit the frame when
 taking a big hit.  Then I was kicking myself, I could have cleaned up and
 old one that I had laying around and saved $7!
 
 The toy is called a KONG.
