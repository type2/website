I agree.  I'm willing to bet that the average reader doesn't see
the connection between the &quot;tech&quot; article and the advertising dollars.

One problem I have with all the funky-fresh kustom stuff is 
supportability.  When you go and modify basic components with
stuff that some 2-bit outfit cobbled together, and one of those
components breaks, then what do you do?  Just hope that
that outfit is still around making the same bits?  And can
you buy individual pieces, or would you be stuck buying a whole
new assembly?  Are their manufacturing tolerances tight enuf that if
you *did* get a new piece, would it fit in with the old piece?
From what I've seen so far, I'd be highly doubtful.

And in either case, they &quot;own&quot; you now - if you have to fix it, you 
either buy from them or put it back to stock.

Some kustom stuff I've seen, I've just had to scratch my head and
ask &quot;why?&quot;&quot;  Like those serpentine generator belt kits.  What's
the point?  Looks?  I can't see how it would be any better functionally.
