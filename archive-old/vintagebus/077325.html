Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

WW also says that the longer handle is for buses up to 67. It may fit but that's not how it came from the factory. The door handle and door pull are separate. The U shaped pull is mounted with 2 screws just under the sliding window. 
 
The pic below shows a 66-67 door handle. ( he doesn't have the pull, BTW)

The WW link-

says it is for buses after 64  up to '67. Bzz. Wrong. 
 
Here are the door pulls for 66-67 buses that use the small door handle. They list the handles as fitting up to '67 so you will buy one.

I think I have those holes too but I never had the pull, my '65 was made in late '65 (April) what about yours.
