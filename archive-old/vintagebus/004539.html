I got this email from a friend of mine and I told him I'd post it to the
list to see what all the experts have to say.  Here we go:
==============================
       Im using some fancy parts on my new motor that I have no experience
with. Any comments would
 be valued.
   #1-- adjustable cam gear,, I'm thinking of putting it in the stock
position, ie[ no built in advance ]
   #2-- teflon buttons,, I'm not sure how to tell if I have them in right ?
also the proper way to install ?
   #3-- rubber cam plug,, install before or after putting case together ?
   #4--brand new case,, It has been machined for bigger jugs,,  I usually
have my used cases professionally
  cleaned but have been told I can clean it myself.  What cleaning fluids
have you guys had good luck with ?
  any other preparation needed ? I've been told to just wash it out with
dish soap and water ? Seems a
  little more needs to be done to keep my piece of mind.
   #5-- do they really run better if you wear a stocking hat during assembly
??
        THANKS----- PIGPEN
   P.S. --- Keep warm and remember; IT'S NEVER TO COLD TO GO PHISHING !!!
===================
I'll forward all replies to him.

Erin
