Subject: *Here is how*  How do you install the factory  locking  steering wheel  set-up
References: &lt;1c.fe6e33.25e305dd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

oldschool,

I have done this conversion twice.  (I am the person Thom F said had written
it up)  While i no longer have a copy of that writeup, i can walk you thru the
conversion.  Do you have the lock unit yet?  Does it work? (Are the tumblers
split?)

What you will need is the stearing column in and out of the bus and
disassembled.  The lock unit.  A piece of 1&quot; dia x 2&quot; long pipe. (i think
these dim's are right)  A drill, mill or file, a welder and other misc tools.
This is not a hard conversion.

Before you take the column out of the bus, take the stearing wheel off and
loosten the column support plate.  Slide the lock unit on the shaft and lign
it up under the tray as if it were istalled.  Mark the top and bottom of the
lock unit on the column.  Mark the orientation of the unit also. (key to the
right and tothe rear)  Take the lock and column out of the bus and disassemble
the column.  Take out the stearing shaft. This is a good time to take
everything apart and clean it all up.

Put the lock back on the column outer housing in the corect orientation.  Mark
the centerline of the lock bolt on the housing. (center line top to bottom
along the length of the column)  Remove the lock and measure the distance from
the top of the lock to the lock bolt center.  Mark this location on the
housing.  You should have a cross now at the point the lock bolt would go thru
the housing.  You will need to mill (drill and file) a slot a little wider
then the lock bolt on this center line about 3/4&quot; long.  Half above and half
below the center mark. (I think i used a 3/8&quot; end mill).  Deburr the cut both
inside and out.

Take the stearing shaft and put it tempararly back into the housing.  Make
sure it is seated all the way in against the upper main bearing.  Mark the
slot location on the inner shaft.  This is where you will weld the lock coller
you are about to make.  Remove the shaft and find that mark.

Take the pipe and make sure it fit's over the shaft.  It should be a fairly
close fit.  I used a plain piece of pipe that i bought at my local hardware
store.  The ID matched the shaft and the OD was smaller (bairly, not much room
to spare) then the housing. (That made life real easy)  Make sure your pipe is
the same.  You only need 1&quot; of the pipe.  I milled off the pipe theads on both
sides of my pipe.  You do not need to do this, i am just anal.  Now mill a
slot up the side of the pipe. ( have also used a hack saw here)  It needs to
be wider then the lock bolt.  Not too wide that it gives alot of play in the
lock unit, just wide enough.  If you go too wide, you will be able to rock the
stearing wheel when it is locked alot.  That gives a theif the oportunity to
break it.

Now slide the modified pipe over the shaft and line it up with the mark you
made earlier.  Secure it in place and reasembly the shaft in the housing with
the pipe.  Make sure it all lines up.  Make sure that the shaft turns too
without the pipe hitting the housing.  If it doesm youmay have to tweak the
pipe a little.  Take it back apart and clean both the shaft and pipe.  Realign
and weld the pipe in place.  I tacked mine in 6 places.  that is enough.  Do
not add so much heat that you warp the shaft.  Do not let the weld get higher
then the pipe diameter or it will not go back into the housing.

Clean and reasemble everything and you are done.  Paint it and install it and
you are ready to go.

As i said, i have done this twice and have rebuilt  4 box's.  If you have any
Q's or if you need more explanation, please feel free to ask.  Make sure the
box you start with is good.  If you can, clean all the bearings (2 main lower,
one upper and one on the cross shaft) examin the bushings and replace the
cross shaft seal.

This lock unit is by no means going to stop a theif who really want's you
bus.  The one on my bug did stop some ametures from getting my bug, but i also
know a nice bus that was stollen with both this lock and a trany lock on  it.
(for that matter a Lo-jack too)  Beware, if they want it nothing you can do
will stop them.

Hope this helped.

&gt; How do you install it on a US spec bus that never had it ?
&gt;
&gt; do you have to weld tabs on the shaft like a bug ?
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have factory instructions?
&gt;
&gt; buses seem to &quot;disappear&quot; too much around here.........Or maybe just a BIG
&gt; dog.....
