   I looked at the wiring diagram from VB and can't find figure out where the
 wipers are on it. Any ideas? Plus, does anyone know if they had auto parking
 wipers in 63? That might explain why there are 4 wires for the wiper motor.
 In the table of Terminal Designation it says that the wipers terminals are
 53. I don't see any 53's on the wire diagram.
   The original wiper switch is still in the bus. I pulled it out and it only
 has 2 terminals on it. Again raising the question of the 4 wires for the
 motor.
   Any help would be greatly appreciated.

self parking wipers were first introduced in 65.   with the big stupid black 
metal frame.   If you have a big stupid black metal frame you have self 
parking wipers.   And extra wires might have something to do with that.
