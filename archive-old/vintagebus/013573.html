Wanna bet?  The reserve on the '56 deluxe is $12.5k, the reserve on
the second is $6k

FWIW, he wouldn't tell me what the reserves were - in fact he wouldn't
even return my emails about the items.  In the auction text, he
justifies the price by saying that the buses would be work $30k-$40k
when restored.  He neglects the fact that to properly restore the
bus would cost ~$25k...
