&gt;  Is there such a thing as a Westy factory done SO-42 w/ pop top in a Deluxe?
&gt;  I recently purchased an original paint '65 13 window deluxe off of 
Everett's
&gt;  site which has what looks to us like a very well done poptop.  It has a 
very
&gt;  clean roof rolled &quot;curb&quot; like other original Westy pop tops, and the
&gt;  original Deluxe headliner is still in place! All the SO-42 interior is in
&gt;  place and it seems to be a '65 vintage kit w/ clam shell lights, etc.  Is
&gt;  this a very well done hack job, or a rare factory job on a complete Deluxe?
&gt;  

I once saw a very nice original white/white 66 or 67 deluxe with what looked 
like a factory installed so 42 westy kit in it.   
  Ya, check the M codes.  Check under the Z bed to see if the rear seat has 
the side hold down screw piece welded into the body.  

I though clam shells were earlier than the so 42 kit.  That so 42s and so 44s 
had the rectangular light covers, that in cross section are a U

the westys z bed should have a tag on it near the floor by the side doors- it 
would say what year  on the tag- that the kit was made.

IN any case, enjoy the bus  :)
