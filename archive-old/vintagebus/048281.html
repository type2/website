&lt;&lt; What is a good way to get rusty bolts loose. More specifically how do I get
 the lug nuts off when they are frozen on! &gt;&gt;
Hi Hood,
Take a hammer and rap, not wail on each lug bolt head three times to powderize
the rust in the threads with the sudden mechanical shock.  Then use a 17mm
socket with minimuim1/2&quot; or larger drive with matching wrench or breaker bar
with a 4' or longer cheater bar.  When reassembling make sure to grease the
threads, and the countersunk areas of both the bolts and rim holes.  Torque to
85 Ft. Lbs. using a five pointed star pattern.   Eric &amp; Barb
