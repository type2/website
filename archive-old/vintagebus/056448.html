Subject: PICT 30-3 Debugging, fuel pump q.


Well, found the floats was a) set to high, as the 30pict3, required 1.5
mm of shimming, and I had one .5 shim. B) Float was unreliable, as it
stuck on brass road that it pivots on. At first I considered the brass
rod should pivot in the slots for it in the carb, but this is not
guaranteed.
When my float was working, some gas was making it's way into the carb,
flooding engine after a run.
After I screwed up the float worse, it flooded constantly, or I go no
gas in her at all.
Needle valve seems to work fine, it must be fuel level and float action.

Fuel pump Q: Is there some internal check mechanism? To stop fuel while
NOT pumping? It is a brosol no rebuildable. A rebuildable Brazillian one
is on its way in case. The pump produces ~3psi-3.2psi at idle. No
noticible drop below 2.9-3.0.  A cheapo regulator is temp there, set
with gauge to make certain we are not going above three.
With the fuel pump disconnected from carb, no fuel continually runs from
gravity, so it appears as nothing is 'passing through' if this is at all
possible.

Would this ential that my problems have been largely float height and
float action then? Or shall I attack the fuel pump in some other way? I
do intend to check rod height, but psi seems ok.

I really need this bus to move soon.

Revamped the carb with 116 main, 65 pilot, 125 air correction (yes I
want to find a 128-135), and I believe when float level is correct, the
main can be inspected to increase further.

What is the affect of a SLIGHTLY low float level? I now have the Beetle
Bentley manual, which has specs for this carb, thank goodness.

One last q, does the float pin retaining clip u shape go toward the
fornt of the car, in line with the curve of the gasket, or towards the
rear, where it seems more capapble of interfering with things?

TIA,
AL
