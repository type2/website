Is there any reason I am getting some responses before I get the
original message? If not could someone answer the question I am going to
ask tomorrow so I don't have to type it out?

Bus Content: I got a news letter from my local vw club and accompanying
my story was an illustration of my bus, complete with oil leaking 4' vw
dealership round sign and my ever handy fender acoustic guitar. I
laughed so hard it hurt, it was very cool.

65 standard (Bernice)
73 thing (Rosane)
