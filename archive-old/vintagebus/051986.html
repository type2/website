Subject: Where's NQ


NQ is alive and well still living in Beatrice Nebraska. Not to speak for
him regarding his deepest motives in life but I can tell you he was
strongly disturbed by events last fall such as 9-11 and the mean
spirited exchanges on the VB list that followed. He has redirected much
of his life energies and says he is happy. He is a good friend and I
wish him well. Please do not make this post the start of a long thread.
I just thought I could answer the question and then we could let it
pass.

Rich Van Baalen wrote&quot;... speaking of good people, has anybody out there
heard from Erin aka &quot;No
Quarter&quot; recently??  He sorta fell off both this and the VintageVW list
a
few months ago.  He had a '67 very similar to mine and I enjoyed hearing
about his exploits (as I go thru mine).

Where are you NQ ????&quot;
