    &gt;&gt;  I went there years ago to pick up a 1800 block for my dad's
    72 loaf and I went around back and saw a guy rattle-canning
    short blocks with aluminum spraypaint.  &lt;&lt;
-------------------------------------

Alas, the efforts of a dedicated artist once again are misunderstood by an
unenlightened Philistine :)

The true beauty of this master's craft is not revealed until after all the
masking tape, aluminum foil, chewing gum, baby food jar lids, remnant seal
and gasket fragments, etc. are meticulously and carefully removed from the
GEX engine.

The complex interplay of light and shadow, spray paint and corroded alloy,
rusty anonymous ferrous materials, large and small cracks, and raw,
crystalline, broken casting, all combine to overwhelm the viewer with a
forceful impression of overwhelming wretchedness and desperation.

Now _that's_ art!!!
