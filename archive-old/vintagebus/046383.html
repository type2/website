To the Friendly and Knowledgeable List Members,

 Long ago, I swapped for a core type III swing axle trans way back
intending to put it the larger backing plates in my '67 Bug. Because of
the scarcity of cheap 5 bolt (pre 66) drums the project got put off .
Now I'm wondering if I could rebuild this thing and install it in my
61Kombie. I've seen articles on this but they say to purchase the
magazine advertiser's kit. (read $$) Has any one done this swap with
stock parts?
I have a 1600 single port with a 30 Pct, 009. and stock exhaust and run
14&quot; rims . My top speed is 63 mph if I loose the reduction boxes what
happens?

you do need a kit to do this.  Thinnk you need modified spring plates.   What
happens is it lowers the bus.   and makes the gearing higher.   I guess you
mean top speed is the highest speed you can push it to, hm?   But-  what is
the gearing you have?   big or little nut RGboxes (axlenuts)  what gearing is
the type 3 tranny?  My 61 bus has a 3.88 r&amp;p with 1.26 (big nut) reduction
gears and is very perky.   I tend to cruise at about 60 mph, and it is barely
ticking over -  3,000 rpms.    just over 20,000 miles on the motor.  stock
muffler, 30 pict, 15&quot; rims with p205 75 15 tires.    I can push it faster, but
tend not to.      It would make sense to get a tach on your bus (even borroe
for the checking of) and figure out where 2K rpms and 3K rpm is in each gear
and think about what gearing you have and what it does and what the gearing
you would change it to does.    I think a 3.88 with 1.26rgboxes ends up about
like a straight 4.12 r&amp;p w/o reduction gears.    I think, but am not sure.
but if you have a 4.37 R&amp;P with 1.39 red.gears then you are going to find you
are at 3K rpms about 47 or so and are winding the piss out of it to get to 63.
Truck that I had was very low geared- I didn;t drive it  fast.   If I took it
up to 60 it was overrevving like anything so I wouldn't do that but  be below
the speed limit in the right lane  if I was on the freeway.   I found a 4.12
R&amp;P with the 1.26 RGB I had in my 65 westy were fine gearwise driving around
for a couple years- I got it rebuildt higher but would not have messed with it
if the tranny wasn't popping out of gear and making noises.

hope that helps.
