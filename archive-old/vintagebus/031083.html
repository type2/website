Good spot painting and blend-in is an art in itself.  Not everyone is up
to the task the first time out, even if you do manage to match the color
correctly.  The original paint, while great in appearance, may be rather
thin from years of buffing, making it harder to to match paint depth
when making a repair.  You start by trying to touch up a small area that
has been keyed, carefully follow up with wet sanding, and before you
know it you find yourself re-painting a whole door...

&gt; I have a bus that has awesome original paint that buffed out really shiny.
&gt; Problem is I'd like to fix the 1% or so with some early signs of rust- under
&gt; the windshield etc. I would prefer to keep the original paint and have a few
&gt; spots ground, dings fixed, and some paint sprayed without doing an entire
&gt; paint job.  Is this adviseable or will it look ittyshay overall? The bus
&gt; looks really good as-is, but I'd like it to be near perfect and prevent
&gt; further rust down the road.  Thanks for the advise.
