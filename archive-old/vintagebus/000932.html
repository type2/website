Subject: holes for wood slats on a dc.

Hi All,
Can someone tell me where the holes (dimensionally) should be for securing
the wood strips to the bed of a double cab (1959 that is).

The bed on my 59 is being massaged and we need to know which holes to keep
and which to weld.

Also, from my understanding (and scanning hot vws for pictures), the wood
slats should only be on every other groove in the bed... right???


Thanks

David
