The brackets are what I need.  The ones that came with these Mud Flaps 
originally are &quot;L&quot;-shaped.  I think the ones I need now attach to the 
splash pan bolt on the &quot;Outer&quot; side of the bus, and to the bumper bracket 
bolt on the &quot;Inner&quot; side of the bus.

Does anyone out there have a set of these brackets that they would be 
willing to part with?
