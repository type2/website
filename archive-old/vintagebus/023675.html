&gt; VanBondo suspects that the &quot;concrete like glue&quot; was a rock hard version of
&gt; the &quot;putty tape&quot; that is readily available at any RV or trailer sales and
&gt; supplier. The putty is exaclty like the window sash putty that was/is used
&gt; in older style home window frames. The putty tape comes in a roll with a
&gt; crepe paper liner. It is produced in a consistant thickness and width. The
&gt; crepe keeps it from sticking together while rolled up like a roll of tape.
&gt; 

Actually the frame that holds the glass did have petrified putty tape,
which wasn't too hard to scrape off. But there is an inner aluminum
frame where the actual &quot;dust seal&quot; goes, which is then glued to the bus,
and this stuff was like concrete.

&gt; Hopefully, we can introduce ourselves at the Seattle meet in July.

Taking our first camping trip of the summer up to the Big Horn mountains
this weekend, made it last year and we'll make it again.  Now Seattle,
Hmmm, not this year, but maybe Jerome Jamboree.
