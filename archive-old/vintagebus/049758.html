Subject: Re: [VB] Engine mounts

&gt;I was surprised again yesterday by how hard it is to get the nuts on the
&gt;upper engine bolts in a Type 2.  In fact, I'm still at it this morning.  I
&gt;think if I can jam a socket and extension in front of the driver's side bolt,
&gt;I may be able to wiggle the nut down past the doghouse shroud and get the
&gt;damned thing started.  I'm still not sure what I'll do to secure the
&gt;right-side bolt.  Anyone have any real good ideas on this subject?


You must be using a dog house setup w/ a non dog house case.  I seem to
remember that he late cases had a nut pressed into the upper left mounting
hole, so you could just screw the bolt in from the tranny side.

Perhaps that press nut can be ontained somewhere?
