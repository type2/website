Here's a trick that was taught to me probably 30 years ago and it works. Get under the bus with your rubber hammer and start hitting things. when you find something that might be the culprit, wrap it in duct tape and go for a ride. if that wasn't the source of the noise, take the tape off and search for another source, tape it and go for a ride. You will eventually find the problem. This works best when you test drive only one possible noise source at a time.

Good luck,

Rick
