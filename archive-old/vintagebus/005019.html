Subject: I WANT A VW ENGINE!!!!

Please! I dont' want to run anything but VW engines!!!!! I only posted that
reply about the V-6 because I saw the post on RAMVA and thought it would be
useful to him. I would never do that, but thats me. Will I watch the show?
Hell yeah. I bet there is alot of people on this list that is gonna watch
it. Is it because I or anyone else wants to actually perform this
conversion? No. At least not in my case. One of my busses have a stock
single port, another with a dual port, and my crew cab(that I will have one
day) is gonna have a 1776. That is all I need. No flames please, just trying
to clear this up.

Happy New Year!
