I recently purchased an NOS Blaupunk AM/FM/SW radio.  I want to 
put it in the '55.  Doe anyone know how the antenna needs to be
configured for shortwave?  Does anyone actually broadcase on 
shortwave anymore?  Or is SW something other than shortwave?

BTW, a friend of mine has a working AM/FM blaupunkt on ebay right now.
