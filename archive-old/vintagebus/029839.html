Ahhh....nothing like shooting a little life into the list every once in
a while.

Did anyone notice that the seat DIDN'T meet the reserve??

I offered it to a person with the correct bus... but I would have really
gotten jipped on the deal they offered me.  You know..some people's
stuff is made of gold... unobtanium really.... even though they have
piles of it.  Sloped roof racks must
be selling for hundreds of thousands these days.....

I know you're thinking....&quot;BUT WAIT!  You're trying to sell that for how
much?!&quot;  but read on....

All I can really say about the seat is that you guys out west will
probably see it at some shows next year...and the 'vintage nazis' will
cringe when they see the vehicle it will be in.  Believe me...I am NOT
lining my pockets with this.  I'm not even
getting money for it.

So...think what you will...it doesn't bother me.
Yes, I do consider myself a &quot;true&quot; bus enthusiast, but sometimes I need
to make some dough too you know.  I have a 30 mile drive to school every
day...and of course 30 miles back....in the bus.  Gas gets spendy...and
fast.  Good thing I graduate in 7 weeks!! Wahoo!!  (actually... its
January 11th... but only 7 more weeks of actual school)  I can't wait...

Whats that Woody?  School?  Not next year... I'm taking a break for a
little while...going to figure out what I really want to do.  I think I
have an idea though.... ;-)

Hey...you guys and gals in the PNW...watch out!  I'm headed your way!!
In February sometime that is...

oh yeah...I almost forgot.  The reserve was $3,000  ;-)  A good and safe
number.  I knew it wouldn't go for that...  If you guys *really* must
know... I was offered $1500 for it outside of ebay.  I turned it down.
Why?  Well.... you guys/gals will have to wait a couple months to see
why....

  &gt;Man, and I thought the one that a certain SoCal parts miser had was
  &gt;pricey _at_ $1000!
  &gt;
  &gt;What did Dave E pay for his?  I may have to add a few $$$ to my RHD
one!

  A *LOT* less... but then I bought mine from a true bus enthusiast that
was
  more interested in seeing the seat go to the correct bus than just
lining his
  pockets like the clown speculators on ebay who don't even own a DD
  passenger bus...
