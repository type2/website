Subject: RE: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth

You know, I just thought of it, but wouldn't most truck tire places be able
to handle the wide five pattern with their equipment. just a thought.

I just had my bus tires balanced at Sam's club in Fountain Valley,
California. Two of Sam's three tire shop employees said they couldn't do it
but the guy who has been there the longest was able to. I guess the right
equipment does no good unless the brain is capable.

&gt; Okay... there was a recent thread about the balancing of rims for our
&gt; beloved beasts and how difficult it was to find a shop.  Interestingly, I
&gt; was replacing tires on my H**da last night and mentioned this to one of
the
&gt; guys in the shop to see if he might, on the off chance, have any thoughts.
&gt; He looked at me funny for a moment and asked &quot;you mean those older rims
with
&gt; the big opening?&quot; to which I responded yep... he gazed up at the roof a
&gt; moment, walked across the shop and reach down behind on of the spin
&gt; balancers and held up what I would swear was an adaptor.  Said they got
them
&gt; in from time to time.  We are talking the spin balancers now and not the
old
&gt; school bubble balancers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, you may ask, is where was I?  COSTCO of all places.  So, if you are
&gt; near one of these outfits you might want to wander into the tire shop and
&gt; see if they have an adaptor.  The fellow in the Vallejo, CA store said he
&gt; thought all the COSTCO tire shops had them but he wasn't certain.
