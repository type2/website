&gt;how do i wire my radio so that it turns off when i turn the key all
&gt;he way off, but can be on when the key is in the first position, 
&gt;before i turn the car on?is that possible?

Not with the stock ignition switch in a VW.  The ignition switch only
has three positions - off, run, start.  In &quot;run&quot; the ignition coil is
powered.  Normally the engine is spinning, the points are opening and
closing, and the coil doesn't have current flowing through it all the
time.  If you're sitting there with the key on and the engine not
turning, and the points happen to be open, everything is cool.  But
if the points happen to be closed, there will be current flowing
continuously through the coil and the points, which they weren't
designed for.  If you sit there long enough, the coil can overheat
and the points can weld themselves together.

VW radios should normally be wired to the &quot;battery hot&quot; wire, so that
you can run the radio anytime, even without the key.  Yes, this means
it's possible to run your battery down with the radio, so you have to
get in the habit of checking the radio before you leave the car.  My
Dad was concerned about this, so I put a lighted switch in the radio
power wire in his Bug - it lights up when the switch is on as a visual
reminder for him to turn it off when he leaves the car.
