&gt;
&gt;noted that drivability went away. Instead of just mashing on the gas 
for more
&gt;power, now I had to gently coax the throttle or it would stumble badly.
&gt;something about needing a different advance curve for a heavy bus vs a 
lighter bug.

I have had a problem with 009's but that was before I took them apart 
and cleaned them up. After they worked great.
