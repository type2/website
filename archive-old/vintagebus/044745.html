Could be BRYCE bumpers.
They look pretty damn nasty and have some diamond plating.
P-mail me if you want photos.

Hi JB,
Sounds like the VOA made by a manufacture in USA diamond plate bumpers 
offered in the 1960s.  They also made a matching cargo side step.  Which we 
are looking for to go with the pair of this type of bumpers we have for our 
1963 SC truck.
