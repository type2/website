&gt; The alternative is that you end up with slightly non-round drums, due

&gt; your braking at all times, not just when the drums are hot, since the
&gt; warp doesn't go away.  As mentioned elsewhere, it doesn't take much
&gt; additional separation for the shoes to not make solid contact.  If
&gt; you've ever had &quot;jerky&quot; brakes, you've experienced the problem of
&gt; warped drums.  It's quite...intriguing....
true,

But warped rotors on a disc brake car cause a pronounced pulsing of the
pedal, you can feel it.  And that cannot be fixed by turning.  You may be
able to fix that by turning drums i dunno, but i would think that the
pedal would pulse and the brakes would be jerky and you would know this
had happened... i dont see it as a reason to turn otherwise good drums.

take care,

Steve
