 &gt; Hi Cal,
 &gt; Actually the 1963 VW Transporter Workshop Manual list the 1955-63 axle 
nuts 
 &gt; to 215 ft. lbs., the 1964-67 as 215-250 ft. lbs., so knock off the slight 
 &gt; bouncing. :-)  As for the FW to crank gland bolt only uses 217 ft. lbs.!   
 &gt; Eric&amp;Barb
 
 But guys, I like that extra bounce! :-) It's kinda like the bounce when
 this old bus goes over one of those dips in the road that are marked with
 a 'bump' sign. Actually, the extra bounce is usually to line up the next
 hole on the nut. The gland nut gets mindful tightening, no bouncing. 
 
 So, even though I'll continue to use the anti-sieze goop on all fasteners,
 what do you guys think of it - it's been an interesting point of
 discussion for decades.

Actually, there's virtually no difference in 215 and 250 ft-lbs. Either is 
equally tight.
If you've ever used a Kymco tool, you can see this. One is a cunt hair 
tighter than the other,  but neither is noticeably tighter. Thus the range of 
values. 215 ft-lbs may correspond to a relative makeup of 0.0001 while 250 
ft-lbs may correspond to 0.00015, for example..
