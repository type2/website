I have a question regarding reasonable prices on:
a set of good used 58-61 tail light lenses,
various deluxe trim pieces for a 23 window including: 2 front pieces, 1
cargo door, 1 from behind cargo doors to rear hatch, 2 rocker moldings.
I have found someone who has these pieces but I am unsure, as he is, what
would be a fair price range. I know responses may vary greatly but It would
even be helpful to present a few different opinions to him. Thanks a bunch.
Chris
