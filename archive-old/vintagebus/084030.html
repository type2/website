Subject: Re: [VB] P&amp;C's?

Hi Seth,
While engine #s are pretty good indicator......   Some USA states  up to 
fairly recently required the engine number as ID for the auto.   Thusly if a new 
engine was needed for your VW you could buy a new engine case  with no numbers 
on it and have stamped on your old engine number.  If it is  a 40 HP engine 
the intake manifold goes outward from the carb, then curves  into a straight 
downward to the heads.  1300/1500/1600 the intake  manifold as it goes downward 
to the heads angles slightly back  inwards.
 
  Yes, one can replace heads, and P&amp;Cs without opening the engine  case.  BUT 
seen this done, and all too often the engine soon  thereafter has a rod or 
main bearing go bad.  Due to the bearings are  too worn and all the new pressure 
from the new parts push the tired bearing too  hard....  Plus once one has 
put about a thousand miles on a P&amp;C set  they can not just be reused in a new 
engine rebuild without having the cylinders  honed out.
 
  Better to take it all apart OR get a core engine, and do a proper  rebuild 
that you will be able to trust far more than an unknown (who built it,  and 
how well, how many miles, how well maintained, how much corrosion  in it, and 
how hard run) engine and not cost you big $$$ to have  a tow back home.
