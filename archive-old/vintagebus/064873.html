&gt; These are the kind that back out real nice by using needle-nose pliers
&gt; or snap-ring pliers stuck in the holes.  I've done it on a metal control
&gt; panel that was mounted with these screws.

The opportunistic thief will have a couple of screwdrivers in his pocket,
and is unlikely to have an interest in spending time figuring out the tool
substitutions needed for unique fasteners.  You can't stop a prepared pro,
but that type probably isn't stealing VW turnsignal lenses.

Back when I designed airliner interiors, it was a prime requirement to
prevent the passengers from disassembling the aircraft in flight.  We used
a fastener called a &quot;tri-wing&quot; head that pretty much could not be removed
without the proper tool.  They were expensive and the tool was a bit hard
to use (it had to be aligned perfectly) but if you wanted the screw to
stay put it was the way to go.
