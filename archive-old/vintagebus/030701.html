&gt; How many SUVs have ended up

&gt; And not because of wrecks, but because new cars
&gt; (for the most part) are disposable.

Well I guess my kid brother's Toyota 
is the exception that proves the rule.
He bought it new in California in the early 80's
and used it for fishing trips and 
commuting to work. 
When his employer transferred him to
Canada, he took the 4runner. 
He used it for a commuter
and even took it to the arctic circle. 
When he moved to the family farm in Missouri 
it still did yeomen duty. It's holding up admirably 
in spite of my older bro.'s hitting a deer with it.
last I heard he was still driving it 50 miles a day.
third (?)and fifth (OD) gear are going out 
but he just keeps it in 4th.

If his wife makes him get rid of it, 
I'm first in line.

I'll keep my kombi too though.

aloha
Ken
