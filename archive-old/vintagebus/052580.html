Subject: Re: [VB] Help Installing Deep Oil Sump

&gt; case.

Thanks Clara,
I knew that I shouldn't try and answer a technical question while under the
influence of three different types of back medication.

I reread my comment and what made sense to me, didn't make sense if you turn
yourself upside down and work relative to the engine.  Rather than &quot;bottom nut&quot;, I
should have used &quot;first nut&quot; or as in your way of always cutting to the heart of
the matter, the &quot;one closest to the engine case&quot;.

Happy New Year!!!
Scott

&gt; if you use the nut closest to the exposed end of the stud to remove it, it
&gt; will likely remove the nut from the stud.   Use the one closest to the engine

&gt;  &gt; 1. How do I get those studs for the oil drain cover plate out (so I can put
&gt;  &gt; the new, longer ones in?
&gt;
&gt;  You could try the two nut trick.  Put two nuts on the stud, put the first on
&gt; on
&gt;  just enough to make room for the second one.  Screw the second nut onto the
&gt;  stud and then tighten the two nuts together.
&gt;
&gt;  You can then use the bottom nut to put the wrench on and turn the stud out of
&gt;  its hole.
