Subject: Tools for Local Manufacture Dec '53 Copies
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2000 22:26:44 -0600
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

I am in the process of making a few copies of my Tools for Local
manufacture book from Dec 1953.
I am not sure of the cost but I thought that I would open it to the list 
if anyone wants a copy to contact me privately and see how many listies 
were interested and see if I could get a deal on printing.  I am not 
looking to get rich and I am not going to take it in the shorts either 
but I just want to get the info to where it is needed.  In your grimy 
hands!!
Let me know!!!!
