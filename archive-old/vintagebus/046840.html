Subject: Solvang sucked
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Aside from having TEN highroofs at the show (too cool), 99% of the people 
(including me) thought the Solvang show completly sucked.
The organazation/layout of the show was terrible (as to be expect from the 
golden gate chapter).
I suppose they have another 2 years to get their act together.
Did ANYONE have a good time there?
OCTO coming soon!!!!!!!
Regards,
Greg
