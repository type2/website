Hi Rex,
We have not tried that.  Might work allright in lower RPMs if you jet it 
correctly.  The 28 was used in 1200-1500cc engines.  When it was used on 1200 
engines the main, pilot, pilot air bleed and power fuel jets were bigger than 
what were used in the 1500 configuration.  The 28PICT has a 22.5mm dia. cast 
in venturi. While the 30PICT-1 has a 24mm dia. cast in venturi.  So to jet 
the 28PICT for a 1600SP and even more so on the DP would require smaller 
jetting to prevent running way too rich.  The 30PICT-3 according to Bentley 
and VW's &quot;Witout Guesswork&quot; books list it having a 26mm dia. cast in venturi.
