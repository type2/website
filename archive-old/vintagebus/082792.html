&gt;&gt;  Has anyone ever heard of.....California Road Runner  Camper Mfg. Co.
in Concord Ca. ?  &lt;&lt;



Hi Brian,
We have!  They were one of probably thousands of camper conversions  during 
the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.
  We are still trying to figure out our 1960 walk thru panel camper  interior 
manufacture.  Have been told that it was made in the Sausalito CA  area, and 
it does have a boat like wood interior.  Anyone in that area that  could do a 
little newspaper research?
