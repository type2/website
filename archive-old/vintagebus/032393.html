&gt;Does RB have an exclusive right to reproduce VW workshop manuals?

yes

&gt;For Instance, Could NEATO (being a legal entity) obtain permission to
&gt;license a reprint of the workshop manual through another publisher.

unlikely...  NEATO is non-profit...  we cover all our bills and have enough
in the bank to cover our future promises (newsletters &amp; postage that our
members pay for in advance), but we do not have venture capital to lay
out to print 1000 copies of a workshop manual.  I think Robert Bentley
would consider selling 1000 copies of a reprint in the 1st year of
publishing a great success.  Better to let the big boys handle this.
