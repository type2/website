Info for vintage Trailer freaks... 
(Posted to Vintage VW bus email list...)
Pass the word on to Rich Yost, Mike Malamet and others
who have arrived at the SOTO/OCTO/Classic/Familienfest
meets with cool trailers in tow. Appologies to others.
Another possibility to think outside of the box(on
wheels). Extend your OCTO/Classic weekend by a week?
We all have endless vacation time, right?
Unfortunately, I/we will be missing the Classic
weekend for the first time in ten years. Have fun-take
photos and please post a trip report! =)
