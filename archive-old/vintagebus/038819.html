If you find a source, post the list please.
For a non-stock, but looks good material, check out your local
large building supplies place, Home Depot here.

In the carpet section is black rubber/vinly ribbed material
in rolls.  Carpet runner.  You'll need about 6 feet I think.  
I have the material to install into my walkthru, but haven't installed it yet.
I intend to install with the ribs parallel to the floor.  Cheap too.
