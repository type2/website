We don't know what people are doing with the buses that are shipped to
Japan.  It is not like we see posts from list members there telling us
about all of the fun they are now having with their &quot;new&quot; old buses.  It
seems almost like a black hole for these wheels.  I think that the issue
of &quot;Buses to Japan&quot; would go away if we knew more about their fate once
they arrived there.  Questions I have are; can you register and drive
left hand drive vehicles in Japan?  Do japanese owners have access to
dry garages, parts, knowledgeable mechanics and so on.  Fears I have are
that some may be used only as cool decorations for japanese nightclubs
and car dealers only to be scrapped once the novelty wears off.  Of
course these fears are only products of my imagination.  Might be pretty
interesting to see a classic in a club!  Gary Gibson
