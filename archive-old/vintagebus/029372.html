There were many months that I looked not at the stars from inside my bus
but at the ground. First through huge rust holes in the floor, then
through where the floor used to be as I was finally able to start the
repairs. 2 weeks ago, after 3 years of work, I was able to sit on the
edge of that floor after the longest journey the bus has taken in over
25 years. Here I was hundreds of miles from home looking up at the Milky
Way in all it's glory. I thought about how many people helped me with
this project. I know that I will never be able to repay them all fully
but somewhere down the road it will be my turn. I hope I can do as much
for someone else. Hang in there. That will be some cruise.
