&gt; I was talking with my grandfather today about the 6v/12v dilemma I'm having

NQ, it gets worse, read on..

&gt; He suggested that I go ahead and run the 12v alternator with 12v battery but
&gt; on the main power lead for the lights/radio/clock/etc., running a big
&gt; resistor (in this case I'd either locate a nice big finned resistor or some
&gt; commercial means to handle the drop) to handle the drop.[...]
&gt;

Won't work AT ALL! Period. End of discussion.  The resistor works on the
principle of
Volts = I (current) * Resistance

The problem with using resistors for voltage dropping is that it will work for
only ONE current value.  That translates into one resistor per device.  One
light.  One radio. One wiper motor.  and on and on.

Don't try the resistor method unless you plan on burning up a bunch of stuff
(lights, radios, clocks) until you find out that each device needs its own
resistor.

And the radio.  What happens when you turn up the volume.  The power consumption
goes up as you try and pump more power through the speakers.  As the power goes
up, current increases, voltage drops in your resistor and now you have even less
voltage to your radio.  Might not even work.

You could build up a voltage regulator but those are limited in current
capability.  You will need a few of these to provide the required current of a
bus (lights, etc.)

I suppose you could put two 6V batteries in series, but now you can't use that
extra battery you have sitting around.

&gt;
&gt; So of course, I've already ordered the XR700 coil from JCW in 6v and it
&gt; appears that it would be best if I went 12v on the engine, 6v for the
&gt; accessories in the bus.  And duh, I guess this makes it a 12v conversion
&gt; then doesn't it?  Oh the tangled webs I get into sometimes!
&gt;

Call JCW and change the order to 12V, it takes them for ever to ship anyway.

Or...  just leave it a 6V and save yourself a TON of [insert favorite
descriptive phrase]
