Subject: Re: [VB] Ben Pons autograph?

Actually they have trademarked, copy righted, and patented, all forms of
paper, paper products, and products made or using pre or post paper
processing materials. In addition to the napkin in question and a plethora
of other products you should be aware this would also include leaves &amp;
splinters.  If you have a tree which has leaves, you should expect a letter
from VOA in the near future.

&gt; The napkin was the exact size and color as the original, and both the
sketch
&gt; and the signature looked authentic...it was the Empi logo that gave it
away
&gt; as a repro.  VOA lawyers have contacted Empi about the unauthorized
&gt; reproduction and the use of the name &quot;Ben&quot; which VOA has trademarked.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does it have the original napkin he used to draw the T1a concept on?
If
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, I'm good for $600 even!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Sadly, the napkin is a repro .
