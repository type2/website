snip!
 
  &gt;&gt;
dormobiles were made on sunroof kombi bodies.  

westfalia's with &quot;dormobile&quot; rooves added at the factory came with the belly
pans, the martin walter dormobiles were not coverted by a factory authrorized
conversion company (i.e. westfalia) and so didn't come with belly pans..

my $0.02 list member christian figenshou from south africa who has an original
martin walter dormie could prolly shed some light on the conversation

start of a long thread here??
