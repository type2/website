Hello Volks,

It's been my experience that the Westy icebox does not do a very good
job at keeping beer cold, and the ice melts too quickly. It does an
excellent job of holding plates, cups, canned/dry goods, etc., and I
carry a Coleman icechest for the cold stuff, which doubles as a good
camp stool (unless you're entertaining a lot of people and have to get
up every 10 seconds to get someone a beer!)...
