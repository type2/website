Subject: FS:  Early Bus Seats - ALL

Sold a early bus, still got the set of seats I was saving for it. Complete set
(bench front, 1/3 2/3 middle and back).  The covering is a oatmeal tweed over
vinyl. I think he said it was TMI stuff when I bought it.  Never been
installed still like new except maybe a few dirty marks from me moving them
around for the last couple of years.  New back aluminum seat bar with orginal
uprights, middle seat grab bar still needs restored, but all the pieces there.
Email for pictures.  $900.  Life will be a lot easier on you with this set,
particularly if you are looking for a middle seat which go for $400-600 ....
Located in Norcal (Marysville, 1/2 north of Sacramento) you must pick up.
Part trade for a '67 only middle 3/4 seat. Gerald
