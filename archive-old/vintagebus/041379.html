Hi Ronnie,
I've got one of these I bought new in the mid 70s.  It uses Mo-Par parts
as I recall and also is weird because the dwell is supposed to be set at 
50 degrees I think.  I don't have any paperwork on it anymore, but those
facts are still in my mind. It was a performance type part.  Worked ok on
my 67 camper back then as I recall.  I still have it in the original box,
but the box doesn't say much on it except for Treuhaft.  

John K.
