Subject: Re: [VB] questions about a bus find

I believe crown made those kits,they no longer make
them or are out of business..if I am not mistaken 
corvair engines run backwards requireing the ring and 
pinion to be reversed or you will end up with 4
reverse gears..so be leary about using that trans in
another vw powered bus..

&gt; Today I looked at a '71 bus. It's a bus that is
&gt; gonna need to be 
&gt; parted out. I need some of the rear-end stuff for a
&gt; future IRS 
&gt; conversion of one of my 60's busses.
&gt; 
&gt; the cool thing is this bus has a corvair engine in
&gt; it. condition is 
&gt; unknown. But I'm wondering about the actual
&gt; conversion parts. Is 
&gt; there someone that sells a kit? If so, how much does
&gt; it run? I'm 
&gt; trying to figure out so that if I buy the whole bus,
&gt; I can figure an 
&gt; actual value of the parts. I'd probably hang onto
&gt; the corvair engine 
&gt; and conversion parts for myself...but was just
&gt; curious of value so I 
&gt; can deal on this junker.
