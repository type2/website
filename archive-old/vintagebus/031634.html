I just helped a bay window owner convert to a SPLIT, I heard of a 2 owner
1967 Riviera walkthrough camper for sale for $2000.00 with tent and all the
goodies, the bus is almost perfect (I've got over 30 photo's), RUST FREE and
complete. I got a call from a customer who asked if I knew of any splits for
sale and turned her on to this one and she bought it, sight unseen. I gave
her the list address and she will be joining soon. She lives in Tennessee
and will be looking for split people in that area. If you live in that area,
post it to the list and I'm sure she'll get back to you.

Howdy All,
I just brought my new '66 Standard home last night, My first splittie!!!
Anyway, after finally getting it started, and letting it run for a few
minutes, there was a big oil puddle under the center rear(toward the front
of the bus) of the engine.  On the bay windows, I know that oil cooler leaks
seem to spot on the drivers side toward the front of the engine.  In the
splits, is it in the same place or do I probably have a main seal leaking.
If so, what is this seal actually called, so I know what to look for when
doing the research.  Thanks in advance!



Peace, John Baker
