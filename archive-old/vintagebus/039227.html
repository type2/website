Jon writ:
&gt;this is very dependant on which size head studs you have.&lt;

I would be interested in learning more on this.

From the Tom Wilson book he just says 23 ft/lbs for the head stud nuts and
of course the corresponding tightening pattern.

I am using 23 ft/lbs on a case with 8mm head studs...  Is there a difference
for 10mm versus 8mm studs?

Thanks,
Adrian
