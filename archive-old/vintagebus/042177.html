WD-40 isn't really a penetrating oil.  It's made to disperse water.

 and some other &quot;Rust-Off&quot; or something like that.  I
&gt; can't say what actually worked on that bolt...oil, heat, concussion,
&gt; cussing, or whatever....probably a combination of all of the above mixed
&gt; with 79.98756% perseverance.  Didn't try the parafin and a torch though...

The key thing here is giving the penetrating oil time to do its work.  For
shock nuts and similar corrosion-prone fasteners it's a good idea to
squirt them repeatedly with penetrating oil for days before you take them
apart.

My favorites are Kroil (hard to find) and Liquid Wrench (yellow can, not
the blue).  Both work well given time.

Of course, you're not forgetting the anti-sieze when you reassemble, are
you?  There will be a next time!
