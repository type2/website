Not a bad idea,

But i perfer to let him wallw in his own, er em... let him suffer by
himself.  I usually just choose to avoid situations that are un-kosher,
even if i really want the thing its not worth the headaches of dealing
with a schmoe.

If you ever want to know how i arrived at this conclusion p-mail me for
the saga of the dishonest landlord, the building inspector, the police and
the city government with more money than sense...
