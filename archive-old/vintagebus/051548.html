Subject: valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

The valves or really noisy on my new rebuild. Still in the break in phase
with less that 200 miles on it. I adjusted the valves today and most were
about .010&quot;. Only one required no adjustment. It seems to me that as the
valves seat, the adjustment would get tight not loose. Is my thinking wrong
here?

Anyway, after the adjustment the noise seemed slightly worse. Being
paranoid, I got out my St. Muir engine noise tape, and sure enough, it
sounds exactly like the &quot;loose valve&quot; engine. It appears to be on the left
side of the engine.

I'll wait till I have another morning free and go through the valve
adjustment again, but I am hardly a novice at this procedure.

Any input?
