&quot;There is an electrical outlet on the side of my westy cabinet facing the 
right side cargo door. Has a chrome bezel on it and is wired to the vertical 
wall light that goes to the battery. Just curious as to what was supposed to 
plug in to it. Since it runs off of the battery, I guess it's not for a 
window A/C unit. :)&quot;

this thing is for some accessories that were available from Westfalia... a 
chandelier to hang over the table... a electric shaver... and some other 
things.
