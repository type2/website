Subject: Fuse box needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

We're in desperate need of an original 8 fuse fuse box (block)  I know they 
make repros, but I'd really rather not have to worry about modifying that one 
to look like an original.  I dont want to run into any sort of wiring 
problems down the road and not have the fuse box in the bus look like the one 
in the bentley.

We got out Wiring Works harness yesterday direct from Wiring works in San 
Pedro.  Bob's a great guy.  Really knows his stuff too.

Anyways, anyone have one?  Gimme a price.  Ronnie? John Howard, Greg? Richard 
Rusty Bus, do you still read the list?  Someone help please.

Thanks
