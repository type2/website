Subject: engine tin, roof rack, 62 westie, safetied tomorrow

help - does anyone have a pic of what an engine should look like from a
59/60 bus - i was told that im missing some tin and id like to see a pic
to compare what i have to what i should have

found a roof rack tonight for $50 cdn - woo hoo - guy says it is
original to a 62/63 westie - it's galvanised with sort of galvanized
pieces of metal running the length of the rack - upon which stuff is
placed - it sort of clips on no screws or anything - looks like 1/2
length - i wonder if it is original to a westie???

looks like i found not only a roof for my 59/60 standard - but also a
westie interior from a 62/63 westie - the guy the sold me the roof rack
steered me to the guy he sold the westie to - who has taken out the
motor, tranny and most of the undercarriage - he is a butcher - sucks
for sure but - i need a roof so what do ya do

we are getting safetied tomorrow - i expect all to go well and hope to
have an insured and registered 1960 standard that is registered as a
1959 standard on the road this time tomorrow - ya hoo
