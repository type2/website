&gt;We just had a hard rain storm come through.  When I went out to start
&gt;my 67 Westy, 1600DP, she kicked over a couple times then refused to
&gt;start.

If it cranks but doesn't start in the wet, I'd look to the ignition
system, especially the high voltage side.  You might make sure all the
high voltage wires are seated well in the distributor cap, coil, and on
the plugs.  Make sure the plugs and wires are set up for each other - if
the wires have the little metal cup, the plug needs the brass sleeve on
the stud, but if the wires have the wire clip, the plug needs to have
just the stud.  All the stock and stock-type replacement sets I have
seen have the wire clip, to go with the studs on the plugs, but I'm sure
there are VWs with plug wires that are set up the other way.

If that's all OK, and the plug wires aren't pretty new, I'd try replacing
them first, including the one from the coil to the distributor.  Next up
would probably be the distributor cap and rotor.  After that, the points
and condenser (a failing condenser can make the ignition intermittent)
and then maybe the coil.

If you want to narrow it down, you might get a spray bottle full of
water, hose down various parts of the ignition system, and try starting
the Bus.  It's probably not a good idea to spray with the engine
running, but if something is bad, spraying before starting should show
it.
