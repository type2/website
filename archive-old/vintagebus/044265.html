 Also at this time it is a good idea to get a larger main jet so the heads
 run a little wetter and cooler.  I recommend a 135.  Save a bundle and find
 a motorcycle shop that carries Minuki carb jets because they fit perfect and
 only cost about $2.50 versus about $12 for a Solex jet (if you can even find
 the size you want).
 
==============
I agree with getting jets through motorcycle shops.  but maybe a 135 is too 
big, bigger isn't always better.  though I dont know ofhabnd what is 
recommended for that carb.

.....................
 One thing to watch for is that the throttle arm does not leak on the sides.
 If it does the throttle arm will need rebushed which I would not try myself,
 but would be an extra expense to fix.  I have not seen a used carb that
 needed rebushed from my limited experiences.
===========================
I've seen them wiggly and oozing  :(   The other day I was perusing one of 
the fine VW magazines, in which there was an article about carb rebushing,  
VW Trends July 2000- showed how Rimco does it.  call Rimco (714) 549-0357 or 
(800) 331-4775. 

 VW also did this, if you find a carb with the \X/ recycle stamp on it it had 
been factory rebushed.
