Subject: RE: [VB] Interior Question

fishin pole hanger. :-)


&gt;&gt;
Can someone click on this link and tell me what the the U shaped cutout on
the shelf above the closet door was for?  I have a '61 panelvan that I am
trying to identify the interior on and my closet and sliding door match the
one in this picture exactly.  Maybe someone put a westy interior in the
panelvan but I have no idea what that cutout would be for.  Thanks.  Don.
