Hi Barry &amp; Jamie,
This is something we looked into also.  Figuring that if we were to keep up
with the traffic that had gone from 55-60 MPH to 65-70 MPH all of the sudden.
 Figuring that since VW had lowered the amount of reduction that the
reduction gears created with or just after each increase of engine HP.  That
since we were going to a nonstock 1600cc engine that we could increase the
top speed of our buses from stock.  So we looked at the idea of what you are
talking about.   First off to do 1:1 gears you would have to mill out the top
of the reduction case halfs and this would have to be strengthened probably
by having this material welded back on the outside top of the case to keep it
&gt;from falling apart.  So to avoid the extra cost and weakness problems we
thought maybe if we could try to make 10 or 15% reduction gears so that the
upper would not need the reduction box machined for clearance.  Since from
OCT 64 to 67 buses used the same .82 fourth gear and ring &amp; pinion that the
K. Ghia used and the Ghia will do 65 MPH _at_ 3,000 engine RPM or 70 MPH _at_ 3,500
engine RPM.  So with a 10% reduction this would reduce these MPH at the same
RPMs by 6.5 MPH and 7 MPH respectively.  This would be a large increase over
the stock bus OCT 64 to 67 used a 24% (26% for 1960-63.) standard reduction
gears this results in a reduction of 15.6 MPH _at_ engine 3,000 RPM which comes
out to 49.4 MPH, or 16.4 MPH reduction _at_ engine 3,500 RPM which comes out as
53.6 MPH.  Well that really excited us and we started to look for places to
have the lower axles gear machined off and new gears fabricated.  The cost
was huge for one set to do one bus and while it did come down with the number
of VWs it was still high.  So we thought about selling these and the problem
came up that one would have to carry a insurance of at least a million
dollars to just cover a possible problem with quality control of these gears.
 Not to mention the folks who might install, drive, or maintain these new
gear kits badly causing an accident and next thing you would know these folks
or thier relatives would try the great American hobby of sueing to to the
hilt both the manufacture and seller of these gears wether or not they were
the cause of death and/or destruction.
  Finally we tried a modified freeway flier tranny which does essentially the
thing as 10% reduction gears using all stock VW parts while keeping the
reductions.  Since tranny talk is a forbidden subject on this list we would
be glad to P-mail you or anyone else this info if you want!
