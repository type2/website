&gt;Im having trouble with my light switch on my 67 bus. I am not getting any 
&gt;power to the running lights (i think its connecter 57) 

By &quot;running lights&quot; do you mean the two small bulbs in the headlight rims,
the tail-lights at the back, or both?  The headlight-rim bulbs are powered
off of #57 at the headlight switch...two skinny wires that go straight
to the lights.  The tail lights at the back are powered off of #58
at the headlight switch...just one heavier wire that goes to the fuse
box and supplies two fuses.  One fuse is for the left light and the
other is for the right and license plate lights.

First make sure all the bulbs and fuses are good.  You can usually
tell if the fuses are blown by looking at them, and sometimes this
works for the bulbs too.  Up front, make sure the little brown ground
wires from the bulb socket to the inside of the headlight bucket
are good on both sides, and in back, check that the tail-light
housings are well grounded (if your brake lights are BRIGHT, they
probably are.)

Only after the above has been done can you suspect the headlight
switch.  When pulled out to the first click, terminals 57, 58, 
and 58b should all be powered.  When pulled out to the second
click, 56, 57, 58, and 58b should all be powered.  If this isn't
so with your switch, it is probably bad.  Before junking it,
you might want to try Eric&amp;Barb's recommendation of disassembling
the switch and soldering the terminals.  You may be able to
find out what's wrong and fix it, and if the switch is bad
anyway, you're not out anything by tearing into it.  :)

Good luck!
