It amazes me how much of this goes on...  With all the rustbuckets out
there, people just seem to love to cut up the rustfree ones.

There have been several occasions where i wanted the bodyshell, and people
said no im gonna cut it up, your dont want it... Or they started hacking
it up without offering it to anyone else first.

Volkswagen people kill more volkswagens than anyone else...  I can see
hacking it up if no-one wants to buy it, who can blame you for disposing
of a rock around your neck...  And if you want to take all the rare parts
and then try to sell whats left as a project thats cool too... but at
least offer a bus for sale before hacking it.

The slider that was recently wrecked here in MO will probably be cut up
too, though in MHO its an easy nose job.  Nothing bent on the floor or
frame. (well the pass side a pillar and dash are severly tweaked, it needs
a COMPLETE nose to be useful again.)  a couple weekends of welding and yer
in bidness...

Just MHO, feel free to cut up anything you want... your conscience will be
haunted by the dead VW souls coming back to you in your sleep, hehe.

take care,

Steve
