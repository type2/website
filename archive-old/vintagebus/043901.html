&gt;     But I wonder if these new mufflers will be of any benefit. Stainless
&gt;    does rust. . .just at a slower rate. And mufflers generally rust from
&gt;     the inside out. With the heat that a VW makes, I am not so sure that
&gt;      stainless will be of any benefit. I, too, am interested to hear of
&gt;                             others experiences.
&gt;                                       
&gt;     Fishing lures are designed to catch humans, not fish. I hope this is
&gt;                          not just another example.

Hey Les, I wasn't suggesting we all go salt water fishing with these, I
intend to bolt one on my engine ;)!

The stainless steel mufflers and heat exchangers sold for use on Porsches
are made from T304 SS.  The mufflers Borla makes for the 911 carry a
1,000,000 mile warranty.  I think that speaks well to the longevity of
well made SS mufflers.

But the VW muffler SoCal sells costs ten times less than the Borla, and 
this likely relates to the quality of materials used.  For me, the price
is good enough to give it a try.  If it lasts twice as long as a stock
muffler it will pay for itself and save some labor.
