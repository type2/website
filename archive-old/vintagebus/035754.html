Uh .......Prague was behind the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;......there are really NO VW 
parts there, VWs were not imported there in the 50s-60s-70s-80s.........

there are a few 70s bay windows that were imported into Czechoslovakia after 
the wall came down......

now it split into 2 countries- Czech Republic and Slovakia

there are weird buses there, Skodas and some Russian ones..........

no VWs , Great Beer........I guess you cannot have it all.........
