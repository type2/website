HI LIST,
I have not posted in many a month.

I noticed round mirror interest...   I have a ton of those in stock, as well
as tons of Wolfsburg West products,

I don't know if anyone else on the list is Wolfsburg West dealer.

I will also be stocking the latest TMI project, original bus interior, I've
been working with them, supplying some original sample for them to locate
and copy.

I will have on my shelf all the seat combos etc. the moment they come out.

Latest BUS FOR SALE is an original paint '65 Kombi, new rubber, brakes,
engine, CLEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BONE STOCK, been sitting since the '70s

Next two slated for fall completion are  '66 Westy pop-top
and '62 23 window. Hopefully will all be on my &quot;car lot&quot;
website-forthcoming.

thanks,
rex
