GO with the 6 volts. I've got a '65 bus original 6volt system. The only thing
I kind of missed was the ability to play am/fm or cd's. But I got a portable
cd player, and some mini speakers. 

Can you explain what the XR700 electronic ignition system is? (Who is Mr. VW
is it Hoover?) Is that the electronic replacement for the contacts, so you
don't have to adjust your contacts? Can I put one on a bus? 

When I bought my bus the PO told me it had a 200mm clutch. I didn't know what
that meant, and still don't. But if what he told me is true, it should be
possible to find one for yourself. 

Good luck.
