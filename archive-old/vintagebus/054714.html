Subject: RE: [VB] positive thoughts 

ronnie rit,
Her post are on the level with me, it must be your Mac
(that what happens when primary transport is a Toyota and a Ford)
Drive the RFH and her text will automatically return to normal on your
screen.

Ellis uses all Intel/NT4.0 866mhz 512mb on board, kick ass vidcard, cable
modem. if forced to up grade to XP I will be going Mac and dumping the wintel
sheist.
I checked my config and the line width in compose and read mode was 72 chars
per line. Upped it to the std VT100 80 char width. No bigs as I just select all
and copy paste into MS Wurd doc if really want to read the posts.
The two keys I use most often lately are select mouse and delete.

Was cleaning out my garage today with a cringe and dump method. Cringing at
potential usage and throwing it away anyway. I really cringed when I bent the
OG front door panel in half and stuffed it in the can. &lt;doh!&gt; Spent all day on
the North wall. Three more to go. Taking the Brutal and gone attack mode.
Anything worth a **** will be fwded to Tillman who gets first dibs then ABC for
the next raffle disaster.
