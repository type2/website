Subject: Re: [VB] tow hitch, westy

&gt; Once mounted this thing is STOUT.  Unfortunately you have to remove it
&gt; to change the sump plate/screen or to drop the motor.  A MAJOR PAIN! 
&gt; Have a look at what they look like.  BTW there are 3 or 4 styles of
&gt; split bus Westy hitch.  They were made well in to the 70's (mine was
&gt; made in '71 for a split though)

i disagree about having to drop it to change the sump plate/screen. i just had mine out and while
it is not straight forward and i can't use sockets on all nuts it does fit and i can get my hand
between the v. the only time i have to take off the hitch is to take out the engine.  and granteed
that can be a pita. just ask britt after the engine removal episode at the classic last year. ;-)
