Subject: Re: [VB] odd (not ballsy) rattle

  I changed out a stinky heat causing muffler, and when I pulled it off it 
was all loose and rattling inside.  The right side piece that went to the heater 
box was loose, too.  hey it was a $20 brazialian muffler and lasted 6 years.  
  How does your heat smell?

Actually that's a pretty good suggestion. Now that you mention it, the
exhaust tone has changed. hmmmm.
