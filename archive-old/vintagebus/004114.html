Subject: Friday Post?  Bug Target Matchbox Giveaway

I have received information now from a few people that have received a flier
from Target.  The flier states that they are giving a way a
Matchbox orange glittery VW Bug.  The first 1,100 people in the store get a
game card to win 1 of 1,000 Matchbox VW Bugs, or 1 of 100 Barbie Camera's,
it should be in there sales ad tonight.  Maybe there are different
promotions for different parts of the country??  I am just trying to pass
this information on to be helpful.  it looks like there is a good chance you
will get a car if you show up at Target Saturday morning, the 25th.  Oh yea,
Happy
Thanksgiving to everyone!!
Anybody want to forward this to the VintageVW list as I no longer subscribe
as can;t figure out how to digest.
