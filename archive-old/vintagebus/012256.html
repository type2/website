I'm still looking for an engine lid for my 59 bus. But which lid is the
right one? The one that is straight all the way down? Or the one with the
hump at the top for the license plate light? My bus rolled out of the
factory in March of 59. So which one is the one? And does anyone have
one???? Also which apron is the right one? The one with the hole or no hole?
I'm still looking for both.

Jay Marvin
