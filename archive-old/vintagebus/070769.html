Subject: Re: [VB] clocks and such

&gt; Koch, in Santa Clarita, CA, re-works steering wheels very nicely. They've
done
&gt; two for me and I've been very satisfied.

I have bought 2 steering wheels from Koch's and both have cracked. One with
about 100 miles of use. Wolfsburg West gets them from Koch's so your better
off ordering
from the source. Since I bought it from WW I had to send it back to them for
the warranty which
slowed the whole replacement process. Then the replacement wheel cracked as
well.

BTW, if you send them your old wheel you can get some credit for it too.
