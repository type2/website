Subject: Re: [VB] Friday long events this week venting

Kelly, and All
You have said what is happening to everyone I know, including me
I have spent the entire week, unable to comprehend the events,, and Like
everyone feels here , wanted to do something to help.
I am so proud of the Canadians that left here, and have joined in the dust and
rain to provide the professional help needed in NYC. I personally know fireman,
Dr's and nurses that traveled to NYC with the intention of putting in their 2
days off ,,, and find they can not leave.
Here, Today were many ceremonies, that allowed us to show the sympathy and
solidarity we have with the U.S.A.
and on my travels around town,, every single flag in our community was at half
mast,, some with the Stars and Stripes flying as well,, 
Some of these flags are on buildings that require specialized equipment to reach
them.

When I travel to American campouts, and Vw Shows, I fly the Canadian Flag with
the Westfalia,, So, as I do not have a flag pole on my front Lawn, I wanted to
show my sorrows today.
Thanks For letting me describe a tiny bit of my feelings

&gt; pressure of things going on in my life rite now have just affected me in a
&gt; way i'm unacustomed to and i needed to vent.
