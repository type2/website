Subject: Repost of musclecar rubber for Safari's
Mime-Version: 1.0

 I told a couple of folks that I'd post this info if I got it. I found it
in the archives after searching for safari* AND rubber* instead of safari*
AND seal*. So here it is again for anyone that wants it. For those that
don't, sorry about redundant info.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen White reminded me that I had left the list dangling on the Safari
22: rubber trick. I had said that a friend of mine has great success with a
23: non-stock fix. Here is what he (Russell) said...
24: 
25: I was driving home today thinking about how nice it is since I replaced
the
26: rubber around my Safari windows. What I used is a soft type of trunk
rubber
27: that I got from GT musclecar, www.gtmusclecar_dot_com Their phone number is
28: (909) 825-0477. The part number is #LP51-C. I bought 20 ft. for under
29: $50.00. I ended up with about 3 feet extra so you could get away with 17
30: ft. probably. It didn't stop the leaking 100% but I have more water
leaking
31: out of my fresh air vent.(that's the next thing to fix) I'm very happy
with
32: the results of the new rubber. I love to drive my bus raining or not. 
33: 
34: He posted this on www.sv2s_dot_com in the Forums, Tech Talk. If you have any
35: questions, feel free to ask him directly! I hope this keeps some of you
36: Safari fans a little bit dryer. I've seen his setup and it looks pretty
good!

So there you have it.
