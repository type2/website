What is everybody's view on either disconnecting the choke or leaving it
hooked up.
I have heard that the choke on fast idle can do horrific things to a 1600
because of the high revs. I have had mine unhooked ever since the last
re-build. Going on the whole &quot;warmitup&quot; thing you dont really have to worry
I guess.
It is good practice to warm the engine of course, but having a choke at
least stops you from having the motor stall out at every stop sign or
traffic light.
Just wanted to hear a few opinions about it,
Thanks,
Andrew
