Subject: RE:  Paint availability

	I have seen this bus first hand at both of the shows he has put
it in and even though it is a nice bus I don't think it is worth the
46,000 he wants for it. To be honest here it is only worth that to a
collector that for some odd reason would pay that kind of cash for a
2600.00 bus off the show room floor to begin with. I myself have a 65 21
window and when it is completely restored couldn't see selling it for
more than 20k at most because we are just dealing with a vehicle and is
sole purpose in life is to be driven and enjoyed.  But not to be on a
trailer or in some showcase museum that will not see the road ever
again. I think that 30 some odd years of inflation will bring values up
on the cars that made a impact on society like the Volkswagens, the
muscle cars, the old luxury cars, etc... But to make them so expensive
for people to enjoy I think makes it wrong. But hey that is only my
opinion and the guys time might be worth 40 or 50 bucks an hour at what
it takes to build one of these and make a profit who knows.


It is just my two cents

&gt;Oh I think that pales in comparison to this quote:
&gt;&quot; *****The starting price $46,000.00&quot;
&gt;What the F*CK does he mean with &quot;starting&quot;??
&gt;
I'm assuming Starting price = asking price

I think the seller chose the &quot;let's double the amount I really want&quot;
method of selling.
