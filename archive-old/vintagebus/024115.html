-SNIP-
&gt; 
&gt; The resistance is in the motor. The 2-speed motor has a separate winding

Glen is mostly completely right, but the early 2 speed 6 volt wiper
motors I've found use a funky cam driven switch to depower the motor
through part of it's cycle. This &quot;coasting&quot; action causes the wiper to
never reach full speed... kinda lopes along in super-sloth mode. The
switch mechanism usually destroys itself due to arcing. The desirable 2
speed motors do have a separate winding, as Glen describes. 

I know this doesn't help, but VW trivia is an important part of the list
content, right?

&gt; &gt; Glynn -
&gt; &gt; endlessly irritaded - by wipers that never run at the right speed. they run
&gt; &gt; like sloaths when cold then gradually warm up to a speed that misses the
&gt; &gt; glass.
&gt; &gt;
I've never had wiper motor change speed that much, but I usually convert
to 12 volt motors (newer splits). You get some change as the generator
kicks in with engine RPM, but it's not that dramatic. 

The dropping resistor might be changing resistance as it warms up...
measure the voltage to the motor when it's warm... 6 to 7 volts should
have it running at sloth speed and is what you'd get in a stock 6V bus.
If the voltage is right, I would dismantle, clean, and lube the motor.
If friction is slowing it down, it won't be long for this world.

In my '58, I didn't want to live with the 6 volt speed, so I figured the
dropping resistor to deliver 9 volts. This seemed to be a good
compromise between speed and cooking the motor (it also used to bend
those linkage arms running the 6V motor on 12V in snow storms). 

You could get a 2 speed switch and run through your 6V drop on slow
speed and 9V drop on high. That way you would only have to run on 9V in
torrential downpours and go easy on the motor the rest of the time.

BTW: All you folks talking about your Busses has me _extremely_ jealous,
as I don't have one on the road right now! Damn work and homeowner
responsibilities are cutting into my Bus building time. I WANNA DRIVE A
SPLIT! Whew... got that out of my system... sorry for dumping a personal
problem on y'all.
