Subject: Re: [VB] bon ami replacement??

Do you have any Sears hardware stores in your area?  Around here
(northern Virginia) they are still carrying Bon Ami.

&gt; ok, i went to SCRUB my pistons and cylinders prior to installation,
&gt; and EVERY store in town has ceased to carry bon ami scrubbing powder.
&gt; ok, so its the only NON-ABRASIVE powder i know by name (recc'd by
&gt; hoover and berg :)  ), but the store guys couldn't think of another
&gt; one, either.
&gt; anyone have an acceptable substitute?
