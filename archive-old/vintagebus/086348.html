Subject: Resolved: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Doesn't Return

Survey Sez:  &quot;Corroded Clutch Pedal Axis!&quot;

I disconnected the clutch cable from the pedal and found that there  
was still heaps
of resistance to moving the pedal.  I then proceeded to disconnect  
the clutch pedal
from the clutch pivot arm, then pulled the pivot arm.  Lots and lots  
of corrosion, gunk,
and the remnants of what was probably grease 40 years ago.

I cleaned the boring (?) with carb cleaner and multiple paper towels  
until the paper
towels started coming out clean (well, mostly), then cleaned the  
shaft in the same
fashion.  Sprayed it all down with silicon spray (thought about using  
moly multipurpose
grease, but didn't have it in front of me), worked the shaft through  
the boring a bit,
sprayed it down again, then reassembled, reconnected the clutch cable  
to the tranny,
adjusted her up, and Voila!  Clutch works again.

While I had her disconnected, etc., I took a hard look at the Bowden  
tube and saw no
signs of wear (woot!), sprayed all the pedal assemblies with silicon  
grease, etc.

Thanks for everyone's help and advice.  It is very much appreciated  
and now I know
what to look for in the future.   I'm also looking forward to lots of  
smooth clutching and
shifting (did the tranny mounts and shift bushing this summer) in my  
immediate future.

Cheers,

&gt; About a week or two ago my clutch pedal started to feel a bit more  
&gt; &quot;tight&quot; when I depressed it.  It was also a bit jumpy coming out of  
&gt; gear.  (This is on my '67 Freedom Camper)
&gt;
&gt; I imagined that this might have something to do with the cold  
&gt; weather (lubrication not cutting it at low temps?) but wasn't sure.
&gt;
&gt; Well, yesterday on my way into work it got significantly worse and  
&gt; when I depressed the clutch pedal, the pedal did NOT return (come  
&gt; up).  I could pull up the pedal with my toe and the clutch would  
&gt; disengage (allowing me to drive) but it wouldn't come up on it's own.
&gt;
&gt; I tightened the cable (it seemed loose even though the freeplay had  
&gt; seemed about right when checked before tightening) and now the  
&gt; freeplay seems &quot;more right&quot; but the clutch is hard to depress - it  
&gt; feels like it's binding.
&gt;
&gt; I also verified that:
&gt;   (a) the spring on the throw-out bearing arm is in place and  
&gt; working, and
&gt;   (b) the bowden tube is tightly attached to it's mount and has a  
&gt; bend in it.
&gt;
&gt; My next step is to pull the clutch cable. I expect that I'm going  
&gt; to find it's frayed somewhere in the middle and as a result,  
&gt; binding in place.  Hopefully it'll come out without any major  
&gt; problems.
