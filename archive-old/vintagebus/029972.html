I know folks are probably already getting tired of this topic, but I'm
gonna throw my two cents in before Thom puts a stop to it.

That was a pretty harsh post Thom produced. I didn't realize that the
Friday rules threw the list open to such unfriendly posts. I sure hope
we won't see any more like that. I don't like reading or hearing remarks
that dehumanize people by grouping them together with disparaging words.
It's no fun, and fun is the main reason I participate in this list.

To make this somewhat bus related. I would like to say that I own a set
of the seat covers John Briney makes. They're really nice. They fit
well, they're well made, and I really like the map pocket on the back of
the driver's seat. Hemp dyes well too. I dyed my seat covers, and after
six months of use, they still look great.

I just spent a couple of weekends putting TMI seat covers in my truck.
The first thing my wife said when she saw them was. &quot;That's nice. Now
can you get some of those hemp seat covers for them?&quot;

I hope Thom's over the pain caused by all that leftover turkey. I'm sure
as he begins feling better, his posts will become more friendly. I also
hope John Briney will get some 1/3, 2/3 seat covers on the market soon.
