Subject: original 15 inch tire size

I just pulled the spare out of my side loader and it appears to be the
original spare.
6.40X15 Continental, all the writing is in German so I would expect this to
be the original, and it's still in excellent condition, overall height 30
lb's of air, not on vehicle is 26 1/2 inches on 15 inch rim, tread width is
4&quot; inches wide.On the side loader now are 7.35 X 15 Goodyear bias ply (at
least 20 years old) still look good though. The weird part is that the 6.40
Continentals are 1/2 inch taller then the 7.35 Goodyear's and I took into
account the weight of the vehicle, this was on a side by side comparison. Go
figure, so I am going to take my spare down to the tire shop and my spare
set of 15 inch wheels to get new tires for the side loader and see how close
we can come to a match, they got some Firestone 6 ply radials (15&quot;) I told
them about a few weeks ago, I forgot the name and size of the tire but they
found them and I will see how they work, hopefully the 6 ply tire dilemma is
now over.

ps: the Continental has no ply rating on it and it is also a tube type.
