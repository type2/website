Subject: Changing generator with engine in

Hello List,

I've done this many times at work... I think Clara explained the
procedure the same way...

Pull the carb, the generator belt, and the rear half of the pulley, and
wires. I use a 1/2&quot; drive ratchet with appropriate socket on the nut on
the fan. I also have a piece of 3/4&quot; thinwall conduit (slightly
flattened) that will slide over the handle of the ratchet. With the
wrench in place, I extend the cheater so it hits on the ceiling of the
engine compartment, while I turn the other end of the generator shaft
with a large crescent wrench (this is much easier than trying to turn
the wrench that's on the fan nut). THEN pull the generator strap and the
4 10mm bolts that hold the fan on. Of course, hang onto the nut and
shims on the front of the fan while pulling the generator and backing
plate out.

It is not necessary to loosen the fan shroud or intake manifold. I've
done this at work on buses, bugs, things and ghias, no problem.

david
