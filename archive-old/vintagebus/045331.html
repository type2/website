&lt;&lt; So I got my front shift rod coupling welded and it look perfects.  So upon
 reassembly would it be a good idea to use anit-seize in there?  &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Yes, of course unless you really enjoy grinding under your bus in five to ten 
years again.  We wonder if it would help to install a zerk fitting into the 
center of the coupler to help prevent rust by being able to pump grease in 
there after assembling everything?
