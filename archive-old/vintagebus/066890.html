&gt;I went back and read the various posts about your problem and the shutting
&gt;off when your volume is too high may be the converter shutting down on
&gt;over current or over temp.  (Converter not rated to the current that the
&gt;radio requires).

Actually, I think it's most likely the radio shutting off on under-voltage.
I have the same converter the Kevin is running and it doesn't appear to have
any overtemp or overcurrent shutdown besides a fuse.  It could be that it
stops oscillating with too much draw on the output but I've never loaded
mine up that hard to find out.

&gt;Putting a capacitor on the output may help it to ride out the peaks in the
&gt;tunes, but may result in a longer period of time before it shuts down.

I mentioned that this probably won't solve the problem but may make it
a little better.  I am approaching it from the point of view that $5 is
a relatively cheap experiment that might yield acceptable results.  If
it doesn't, the next step is to spend considerably more on a different
inverter.
