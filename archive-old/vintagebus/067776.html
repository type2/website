Subject: Re: [VB] Gas tank divider panels SC/DC

All 50's have had the early style so far. sometime in the early 1960s it changed to the mid style,
but the change has not been steady when looking at diff early 60's models. The later change came
around 66/67.
Its just like the slash/pointed bumper change BS with the 'use remaining supply' etc for both
changes, except we have no dates to even compare to like bumpers.

There is no diff in DC and SC panels.

&gt;    I know this has come up before but now I am really wondering. Did single
&gt; cabs and double cabs use the same gas tank dividers? Also what year,
&gt; actually month, did they change styles.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here is why I ask, my 59 SC ( built,august 59, 505 701) has what you call
&gt; early (as per David Mayes), my 60 DC , (built, april 1960, 610 855), has
&gt; what you call mid (as per David Mayes). So now we know that sometime between
&gt; august of 1959 and april of 1960 they changed, BUT WHEN and is there a
&gt; difference beteen SC and DC
