Subject: Re: [VB] OOO, Body Filler!

&gt;  Over the last 20 or so years that
&gt; this bus has been sitting outside, the body filler has apparently absorbed
&gt; some water and the top coat of paint has peeled away, leaving the body
&gt; filler right out there in the elements. .

Actually, the way this happened is, the paint film failed in some way,
cracked, wore thin, etc, when this happened, moisture reached the filler. So
many people think that filler simply disintegrates beneath a good film of
paint and then causes the paint to fail.

&gt; The filler still seems to be smooth enough, and I am wondering if i can
dry
&gt; this stuff out under some heat lamps or something for a couple of weeks
and
&gt; then just sand it, prime it and paint it.

I don't recommend this. The reason is, the moisture has probably penetrated
the filler and has reached the underlying metal. If it has, no amount of
drying will remove the oxidation from the metal. I suggest that you should
grind out all the old filler to bare metal and straighten the metal or
reapply the filler.
