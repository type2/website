&gt; George had lots of good ideas for getting the pulley off. Here is one more.
&gt; Crack the bolt loose and turn it out about 1 turn. Tap the head of the bolt
&gt; with a small sledge and the pulley should walk out the bot head. keep
&gt; backing the bolt out and tapping. Keep in mind that if you tap too hard, the
&gt; threads on the bolt will deform. This is a fair tecnique for starting the
&gt; removal. Once the pulley is moving, use a large gear puller.

I'd save this one for last.  When you are tapping on the bolt you are
really tapping on the end of the crankshaft, using the inertia of the
pulley to hold it in place.  Be sure to pull the pulley toward you before
tapping, or the force will just go to hammering the thrust bearing.
