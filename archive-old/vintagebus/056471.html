I still believe that you have a soft line ballooning under pressure causing
the bus to grab and pull to one side.  Heck soft lines are only 410 apiece
and well worth the peace of mind

&gt; So I had a few minutes to spare today and so I checked my brake fluid and
&gt; topped it up and adjusted both front brakes.  The driver's side looked
fine
&gt; when I looked in the little hole but the passenger side looked a little
&gt; greasy so I took the wheel off and everything looked fine.  I tested the
&gt; brakes out at a slow speed and they all worked very well - BUT - when I
took
&gt; my bus out on the highway and applied the brakes it pulled dangerously to
&gt; the right again .... hmmmm.  I'm wondering if this could be some sort of
&gt; alignment problem and not a brake problem at all.  I did have tie rods
&gt; replaced and maybe they didn't do it right?  I normally try and figure out
&gt; how to fix my own bus but .... I needed a safety inspection for and didn't
&gt; have time to do the work ... damn.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; jdd writ:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had tie rods replaced at a local shop and haven't really driven my
bus
&gt; &gt; &gt; much since.  Then today I applied the brakes and my bus really pulled
to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; right.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't really have time to look at it until next weekend when I'm
&gt; planning
&gt; &gt; &gt; a tune up and oil change - but does anyone have any ideas as to why my
&gt; bus
&gt; &gt; &gt; would pull to one side like that. I guess a brake adjustment is the
&gt; first
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to try but I thought I'd ask.
