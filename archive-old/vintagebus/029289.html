Reading over this discussion (yet again) I get the feeling that some of you
need to get out of the big city!  

When I put my info on the AIRS (&amp; westfalia_dot_org) site it was because of my
desire to 'give something back'.  I really do not care where a fellow
Volkswagen owner in need comes up with my contact info.  If he/she is in need
and I can help I will.  If I am asked for more than I am comfortable giving, I
CAN say, &quot;No.&quot;  It's just that simple.  Same goes for the guy who puts his
truck in a ditch.  If I can pull him out, I will, if I can't, I can give him a
ride to town.  If he doesn't want a ride to town, I can call the local
authorities.  Cost to me?  About nothing.  Reward to me? Priceless.

If I were as concerned as some seem to be about the info on AIRS, it would be
a simple matter to remove my entry. But then again, I got out of the big city
years ago and have lost much of my paranoia.
