I seem to be hard on throw-out bearings (although I think I've finally
figured that problem out).  Beyond that, I've found there are lots of
maintenance tasks that are much easier with the engine out, so I tend
to pull it any time I need to do anything more drastic than changing a
tire in the back.  Makes inspecting for incipient problems easier,
too.  On one bus (not the current one), it was actually easier to pull
the engine to adjust the valves....
