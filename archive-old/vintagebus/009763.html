Why re-invent a more complex wheel?

SunShowers work very well, come in various sizes for your showering
convenience, and are relatively inexpensive.  They heat up even in overcast
conditions, and when you're through can be rolled up and stowed out of the
way.

They even sell an enclosure that could be hung from a bus's raised rear
hatch if privacy is an issue.  One of the vendors [Izzy's?] at the Northwest
Vintage Meet last summer was selling a similar enclosure for mounting on the
rear hatch, if you desire a bus-specific item :)

&gt;&gt;  Wow, what a great Idea ..... but .... what if you had the water source
on your roof rack and had a hose that somehow went into the engine
compartment .... where it went into a small radiator like thing that just
got warm from being in the engine compartment - the things with fins on them
..... maybe it could be mounted near the battery tray on the side the
battery isn't.  &lt;&lt;
