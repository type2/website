Subject: RE: [VB] Aluminum block

  Make sure you check the serial number on the case. Pre 3000 numbers have a
lot of little problems, 3001 to 4999 are better and all of the post 5000
numbers I have seen need nothing, they finally figured it out.
  My supplier has a jig they now use to check the crank, cam bore alignment.
I know nothing of EMPIS aluminum cases as I stick with who I have delt with.
  I am building case number 5356 right now and have not had to do anything
on the case for clearancing. Cam, crank (69 forged CW) or dizzy drive. I did
try 3 different styles of dizzy drives and found that the cases are
clearenced for a new Mexico drive and that an OG German drive has very tight
clearance. 
  I have not find any Locktite in any of the post 3000 number cases and very
little casting flash.
  The outside of the cases are very rough and are not pretty, but that
doesn't affect the assembly. Seems they improved the machining but let the
cosmedics slip.

Check for excess green locktite in oil galleys and such, the distributor
drive gear usually needs clearancing to be able to rotate freeley, etc, etc.

Make sure you do a complete test assembly to make sure you have no
interference problems, as well as make sure it is cleaned very well.  These
are problems common with just about all the aluminum cases that are coming
out. They're great cases once you get the quirks worked out of them.

&gt; A mechanic I trust with all my VW parts here in Seattle, Jerry at North
West
&gt; Connecting Rod, had some interesting things to say about the dozen or so
&gt; aluminum blocks he has worked with. One of the things is clearance for
welded
&gt; CW cranks. There are a lot of low budget CW cranks out there and many of
them
&gt; need to have the case clearance. The lifter bore tops need to be surfaced
and
&gt; chamfered to drop the lifters down enough to clear for even mild cams.
Then
&gt; the issue of cooling because magnesium disperses heat faster than
aluminum, it
&gt; seems to hold on to the heat raising the oil temp.
&gt;
&gt; Knowing all this, I decided to give one a try and have it punched out to
90.5
&gt; and drilled for full flow.  I'm going to cork it first and try it with a
dog
&gt; house cooler.\, but if it seems too hot I will go to an external cooler
and
&gt; filter. Hopefully this won't end up to be the nightmare met with by
others.
&gt; I'll keep you up to date.
