&lt;&lt; When I turn the heat on in my bus, there is a not so good smell coming out,
 should my heater hose have hose clamps on either end,and where the hose goes
 throught the engine tin? Is that all I need to do to correct the odor 
problem? &gt;&gt;
Hi Keven,
Probably the last thing that is causing the oder is those clamps.  Though it 
is a good idea for cooling reasons to have tham and the lower to tin rubber 
seals.  You really need to start up you VW and check by hand to see if any 
exaust gasses are making it past the O-ring exhuast seals on the rear of the 
heater boxes.  If there are leaks there you need to find out if the rear tube 
end of the boxes are just worn/erroded/rusted down to small for the O-ring 
seals to work.  What ever you do, do not use the press in fit tube repair 
sold by most VW FLAPS or it will restrict the exhaust from number 1 or 3 
cylinder causing them to run hotter.  Then check by pushing on the sheet 
metal skins of the heater boxes to make sure they are not moving about 1/8&quot; 
or more seperately up-down and/or side to side from the J-tubes inside of 
them.  If they do move then either new boxes are in order or some welding is 
needed on your old ones.  If you get new heater boxes for an engine bigger 
than a 1200cc make sure that they are not the cheaper Dansk ones without 
inner fins inside the heater tubes which are just visible by eye if you look 
into the J-tube with a flashlight held just so to see the sides of the inside 
in there about 4 inches from the rear.  Also check the front sealing surfaces 
of the heater boxes when they are off to make sure they are flat and if not 
use a cresent wrench to bent out the worse and flat file out the rest.  Could 
also be that your muffler is wrong for your bus or worn out.  What ever it is 
get it fixed ASAP.  Carbon monoxide is a lot like radiation and if it does 
not kill you or your passengers out right it will brain damage you over time.
