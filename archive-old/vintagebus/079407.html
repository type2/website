Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Question on my '67....

Hi Scott,
Sounds like a bad wiring connection and/or grounding.  Also could be the 
1966-67 signal switch realy is loosening up.  Those relays are built like a layer 
cake with several layers of circuit boards, with long brass tubular rivets 
through these boards not only pulling them togather, but the rivets act as 
electrical connections between the circuit boards.  
Once the rivets stretch the connections between the circuit boards get faulty.
  Not good idea to grease the turn signal switch because as we found out the 
switch will not stay in the signal position while you steer around a corner 
without the normal friction inside the switch.
