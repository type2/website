&gt;Hi
&gt;If you are planning on attending EveryBus 2001 this weekend in North 
&gt;Carolina the weather looks fantastic!
===========================&gt;
Looking at the weather forecast, I think you folks are gonna have a GREAT 
Time of it !
Here in Houston today we had a high of 69 with dry crisp air, and it is 
headed your way.
I saw where the outer banks might even have frost tonight........ Duh !?

Next year, Mary Beth and I are hoping to attend your event, as we will 
schedule our departure for our 2002 East Coast trip to chime in with your 
event.

Just now, I am doing bits and pieces of minutia bus work on Casper for us 
to depart for the 2001 West Coast trip in a couple of weeks.

Excited?
Us ?
You betcha !!!!!!!!!!!!

We just finished assembling our selected collection of what/where/how books 
for the trip, and this time, unlike my trip of two years ago, I have more 
info on BLS, NPS, and FREE camping spots than I thought possible to assemble.

Excited?
Us?
You betcha !!!!!!!!!
