Subject: FS: Race Motor

ENGINE MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM
    Motec M4 Pro engine management control system $2900.00 never used.
    (This is an adjustable fuel injection brain)

This is not mine, but my friend is a very serious race car builder.  He
builds many of the cars you see in the VW rags.  He bought this for a
ghia he is building, but changed his mind and is going Audi V6 instead.
Pics of his car in progress will be in the next Hot VWs.

I also have some other bug/ghia stuff FS if someone would be interested
in forwarding them to the air cooled list.
