&gt;don't blow off what you have as of yet try the 150 main and you will see a

manx copy
&gt;my single port 1776 in my bus has a new pict 34 and 009 dizzy ask ellis how
&gt;i blew past him in the fully loaded panel on I 10 coming from pomona, also my
66
&gt;westy has a stock 1600 with a 009 and a pict 34 no problem, also i think
howards
&gt;binz just made it from az to new hamshire had a new pict 34 and 009, not to
&gt;praise the 009 or carb, but yes they will work together with a little
thought,......

Hi friends,
I remember this battle well with my '65 deluxe 1600 dual port.  I must admit my
curiosity is peaked with ronnies confidence, sounds great .......... good gas
mileage and more power.   Hummmmmm

A few years back I had the fresh $800 GEX motor on the engine stand and all the
black powder coated engine tin installed and my brand new $50 009 distributor
and my brand new $149 PICT 34 and my new dual quiet pack $125 S&amp;S header ready
to go ( a real beauty).  My first problem was the carb hitting the alternator,
so having access to a full machine shop I had  a spacer made (approx 1&quot;) to go
between the carb and the manifold.  

This combination made this bus run like SH*T!  Broke-neck hesitation in first
gear, terrible gas mileage, and a very dragging and ultra annoying deceleration
(i.e., down-shifting, or simply letting up on the gas while in gear moving). 
All of the local experts had differing opinions as to my problem.  One said it's
the carb and I should use a jet drill and open up the fuel flow, the other said
the spacer was the problem, and the other said there wasn't enough back pressure
with the S&amp;S header system.  I tried as many recommendations I could get my ears
on, to no avail.  Needless to say, my total frustration caused me to yank the
PICT 34, the spacer and the S&amp;S system for bone stock PICT 28 and exhaust
leaving the 009 dist .  From that point on it ran beautifully.

To date I have a brand new PICT 34 just a sittin in the garage (with drilled out
jets ..... more like reamed), and my question is after reading ronnies post,
should I reinstall my spacer and my &quot;NEW&quot; PICT 34 (with  155 jet) and make a go
of it , of course leaving out the S&amp;S header or should I not fix what ain't
broke?  A little more power would be nice but not at the expense of fuel economy
or energy lost focused at another battle.  I guess the spacer is the real
question here.  Will a one inch spacer between my manifold and carb to clear my
alternator drastically affect my motors performance?  The Idea of bending my
manifold,or switching to a generator is not an option.  Please advise.

If the one inch spacer is a no-go, and I decide not to fix what's not broke,
then anyone want to buy a real cheap slightly used and slightly reamed PICT-34? 
I'll even throw in a one inch spacer for free!

Thanks in advance,
