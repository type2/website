here is a reply to an email i sent to Dormobile in regard to the Dormatic
seats. I thought that some of you might be interested. if you don't know
what Dormoatic seats are, you can check them out here:

these seats were put in Dormobiles made by Martin Walter, not Westfalia. If
you have a Dormobile, you should email these guys and tell them. especially
if you are interested in them remanufacturing the seats.

Thank you for your e-mail.  If you're stuck for any particular parts, please
let us know. In  regard to the Dormatic seats, we have had a number of
inquiries for the split window version, and are looking into the feasibility
of reproducing them but we need to gauge the level of serious interest. Your
comments would be appreciated.   If your roof is hinged from the opposite
side (this is unusual) they must have had to do some clever engineering.  I
would assume the mould would have been reinforced on the opposite side to
the hinges and I would be interested in further details on this.  If we can
help with orginal roof vent seals etc., please let us know.

kind regards,


Simon DeBues
