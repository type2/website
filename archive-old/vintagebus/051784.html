   The man with the most money wins when it comes to resto. Even though John
J has over 24,000 dollars and 1000's of hours in his bus, he will never get
the respect from the vintage n#zis (should he have just restored it), even
though the workmanship is of top notch quality, because it isn't OG. Even
Dave will be ripped to shreds for his chromed plated out all OG, lowered DC,
but nobodys ripping on him because THEY have gotten his money. 
   So we are back to the same old thing vintage, OG, a so called resto, of
which most are just reconditioned (my new phrase, for all the so-called
restored buses out there). or just a plain old original rust bucket, like
most of mine.
  I can't wait till my 60 DC is done so I can get some of the ripping on,
Viper Red, tan tweed interior, chrome stock 15 inch wheels, Porsche 356
engine, AC, all on a perfect rust free OG (was) 1960 DC, but that's what I I
I I I  want to do. I have an OG 15 window, my Westy is complete and OG, my
DD panel looks stock, but everything is the way I I I I I want it.

ronnie   do it YOUR way 
ps. Look at the next issue of Hot VW
pps. I guess someone needs to start an OG VW mag, probally been thought of
but not enough of them around to do 2 or 3 issues.

it takes alot more research and parts hunting to make a completely stock
bus than a chromed out pimp-mobile.
i'm not saying that's what the orignal bus in question is. a good job is a
good job, regardless of the style it's done in, but alot of the custom
stuff i've seen at shows over the years leaves alot to be desired in the
way of quality workmanship.
i think custom often means no respect to the vehicle, the secret desire of
the owner to own something other than a vw, and a credit card with a brain
dead owner who thinks vw parts are made in taiwan.

HARSH!!

&gt;Completely stock often means no original thought and no personality.
