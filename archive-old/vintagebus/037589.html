 &gt;Also seen NOS headliners in the pretty \X/\X/\X/\X/ box, but wrong year
 for me.

 I've seen these too but had someone state a vinyl one would have probably
 shrunken over time, making it worthless.  Opinion?

My opinion is that if it had been the right one for my bus I would have paid 
the $50 for it.  VW actually made headliners in a variety of whites.  Can 
anyone tell the differnce between a blue white , cumulous white,  pearl white 
etc vinyl headliner?  but the turquoise/bluewhite 64s had a very distinctive 
headliner.
