Subject: Reduction box bearings


All this talk about how expensive it is to rebuild the reduction boxes 
on early buses had me worried so I talked to my father who owns a 
repair shop in SOCAL ( mostly Mercedes, Audi, BMW &amp; Porsche ). He's 
also a bonafide VW factory trained mechanic, received his meister from 
VW in 1957.  Well...he did a little research and found out he can get 
the bearings for the following prices:

6302    $14.00
6306    $14.00
Roller  $42.00 sorry, I couldn't remember the #

You only need the expensive roller bearing if your bus has the large 
axles ( 64' &amp; later, I think ).  Additionally, even though these 
bearings are made by FAG that doesn't mean they're made Germany since 
FAG has factories in Spain, France and miscellaneous other countries.

So, worse case scenario is approximately $168 +tax in bearings to 
rebuild your reduction boxes.

Hope this helps,

Jeff
