Enough of this thread, I think.  I just hope that nobody mixes up Ron at Bus

Depot with Ronnie at Type2parts_dot_com or Old Volks Home.  While I've never 
ordered over the phone or through his catalog (I see him in person often 
enough), I know he answers his own phone and is very knowledgeable about all

split bus parts.

Just don't want Ronnie losing business because of others w/ similar names.
