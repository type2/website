Wife/Husband is someone to pump breaks and do other &quot;two person&quot; jobs.
Kids fill in when the significant other refuses to pump anymore brakes.

Now we're talking.

-A job is just a way to acquire cash to spend on the bus.
-A house is just a place to safely store the bus when we are too 
tired to continue driving.
-The Wife/Husband, ect. is someone to keep you company while 
driving/enjoying the bus.
-Kids are things which aid in justifying owning many buses (&quot;Its for 
the kids when they are old enough. Ya sure).

-Rocky

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Buscentricity - A non-bus must be thought of in bus terms...
&gt;Minivans are Bus ripoffs, Bugs are just small Buses, houses are big 
&gt;buses without wheels, computers were invented to help bus owners, 
&gt;etc.
