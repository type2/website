Subject: Re: [VB] New to the list


Welcome Gary,

Your heat exchanger flaps rotate about 80 - 90 degrees via the large lever
that grabs the half-levered pin. The large lever should have a wire spring
wrapped around it and its axle.

If you disconnect the large lever from the small one
with the engaged pin, it should rotate freely. If not, try and determine
(and repair) the problem. It should close completely and open at least
most of the way to parallel with the outlet.

Ordinary wheel bearing grease lightly applied to appropriate places should
keep things going well. Moderate bending (adjusting) of levers and such
will not be taken as 'incorrect' by the perfectionists on the list!

Good luck,

&gt; adjusting the heater cables last nite, but it seems the flappers in the heat
&gt; exchangers are just not too effective at blocking off the flow of warm air.
