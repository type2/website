Subject: VW's in the classroom
Message-Id: &lt;l031303006318d1fc1f7a_at_[128.0.0.164]&gt;

This week, a number of teachers including myself got together to do an
inter disciplinary unit for earth day that would last all week.  We
scheduled the kids so that we would have all 600 in rotations.  We did the
same 2 hour presentation 10 times this week!

My presentation was titled &quot;alternative energy sources&quot;.  In my
presentation I covered Solar, Ethanol, Wind and Fuel Cell technology.  I
brought in all kinds of &quot;props&quot; such as an old wind generator, a fan from a
full sized Kansas wind mill, solar panels and numerous short videos.  But
as students retain information much better if something is demonstrated to
them, I wanted to produce power with a simple generation station.

For my generation station, I choose an old stationary bike and a VW
generator.  I mounted the generator with a simple bracket I welded up and a
hub that I turned on a lathe to take the place of the belt pulley. I also
put a VW voltage regulator in line to control the generator.  With a
renewable energy source (student power) we are able to power a small 12V TV
at 15 M.P.H.  If I used a 12V inverter from a westy, I bet we are putting
out enough amps to power a much larger 19&quot; TV.

I know this is not a new idea, but it sure does get the point across to the
students which is what I wanted to do.  I fact, I heard this week that
someone is going to market these things for those &quot;couch potato&quot; kids.  But
this really is a simple power station and as I explain to the kids, the
generator could be turned by anything, wind, geo thermal, hydro, or pedal
power!

I also built a really neat electric mini bike to demonstrate electric
vehicles to the kids.  I had a lot of fun with this, even going so far as
to dress up as &quot;Professor Sprocket&quot; in my rasta (sp?) hat with dreadlocks,
sun glasses and an island shirt.  The kids really love to see teachers act
it up, it gives them that many more reasons to make fun of us!!

The bike works great and I think I will have to take it camping a few times
this summer along with running around the farm on!  I may have to build a
scaled down side car to carry my 1 year old daughter in and to gather parts
up at the local swap meets.  This should be a perfect swap meet vehicle, I
can jump on and off without starting it and with the side car, I won't even
have to put the kick stand down!  The bike will run well over a couple of
hours on a single charge and does about 30 M.P.H..  Old shop teachers are
really big kids that have not grown up.
