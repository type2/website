Subject: It's aliiive!!! ('64 back on the road) [long]
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10007151827520.27635-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hey all!

I got the '64 legal and on the road yesterday!

After getting the insurance, title, and tags squared away, I worked on
the fuel lines a bit.  I had to replace the small 4&quot; section between
the pump inlet and the metal line, and for the rest of it, I just cut
about an inch off the end of the rubber lines and re-clamped.  I will
replace these lines soon, but I just wanted to see if I could get the
engine fired up safely.

I had charged up the battery a couple of nights ago.  I cleaned up the
battery terminals and cable ends, and put a new cable end on the
positive cable -- half of the strands were broken on the old one!
I'll probably end up replacing this cable.  After looking around, I
went up front to try it, and still got the same disappointing
&quot;rowr...[silence]...rowr...[silence]&quot; starter action.  I know it's
just 6v, but it ought to turn over a little better than that.  Hmm.
I know the positive cable runs right to the starter.  The negative
cable, though, runs to the body, which is connected by a ground
strap to the transmission.  That seemed a rather roundabout way to
me, so I connected another battery cable from the bolt where the
negative cable mounts to the body to one of the generator pedestal
studs.  Tried it again... &quot;rowr,rowr,rowr,rowr,ru,ru,ru,VOOOM!!!&quot;
HOORAY!

I ran it for a bit, shut it off, and checked the fuel lines for leakage.
No leakage.  I then became crazed with the desire to drive it.  :)  
The right tail-light socket is messed up, so I hooked up a &quot;generic&quot;
trailer tail-light in its place and installed a 6v bulb.  I ran the
engine a few more times to make sure all was well, frantically cleaned
up the tools behind the Bus, moved the F*rd out of the way, and...
drove it!!!

First impressions:  Clutch seems to be good but could use a bit of
adjusting.  I think it needs shocks...bouncy bouncy.  I scared myself
at the first stop...I wasn't mentally prepared for the fact that
36-year-old manual 4-wheel drums do not stop as fast as 10-year-old
power front discs.  After a bit of careful checking, I found that
yes, the brakes worked, the pedal is hard...I just have to start
using them sooner.  So I proceeded to the burger joint (half a mile
away) and had dinner.  I still have charging system issues...when
I came out it didn't want to crank fast enough to start.  A helpful
guy gave me a boost with one of those battery-in-a-box things and
I got back home.  When I got home I did a happy dance around the
Bus.  :)

It's by no means ready for any trip over a few miles.  I need to
make up a battery hold-down, replace the fuel line, go through
the brakes, and do a tune-up, at a bare minimum.  But I'm just
stoked up that I got it going!  Yay!
