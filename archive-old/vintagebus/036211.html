 Does anyone know what the &quot;trap door&quot; on the lower section of the
 front seat bulkhead is for?  Anyone have a door for it, or at least
 a good picture?
 
 BTW, a single cab lower bulkhead is identical to the barndoor lower
 bulkhead, once you remove the additional supports for the bed...

yes I know what it is.  I might have a door but have no Idea where it is.  
took the one off the 54 kombi  to help clean it out, and forgot to put it 
back on.  what is it for?  I think it helps you clean out the bus.  We took a 
bucket of soapy and scrub brushes  and a hose to the inside of the bus- 
removing the seats first.   It had been mouse home for a long time and 
reeked.  had to pull wads of seat stuffing out from the compartment under the 
front seat.  the front seat was just springs, and not too cosy.
