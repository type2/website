It is listed in their paper catalog.  I was going to buy a set of those
ratching box wrenches until I noticed that they omitted the 17mm and put
in (IIRC) a 15mm and an 18mm.  Seems like a cheap ploy to sell you a set
of wrenches, two of which you'll seldom use, then sell you the 17mm and
19mm wrenches singly.
