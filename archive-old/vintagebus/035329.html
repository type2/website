&lt;&lt; Assuming the decklid is original to the bus.
Its atleast post May-1956.
Leaving only about 90 days for a &quot;1956 model year&quot; bus, chances are you have 
a 57 standard sunroof.
These were originally imported into the states.
Pay the dealership and extra 130$ bucks and its yours!
Yes, rare bus.
I had a June 1957 sunroof standard and I screwed up big time by shipping the 
roof to Europe while leaving the rest here! DOH!
