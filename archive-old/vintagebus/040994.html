Jamie,

I haven't installed a wiring harness, but I've pulled one out. I assume it will be not-too-hard....but time consuming and tedious...and requiring some brain work. If I was going to replace one in a bus with a complete harness, I think I'd pull and replace in the same sitting so I could see where wires are and where they go. I like Eric and Barb's advice to pull a couple out of junk buses. I feel like I gained a lot of insight into the wiring system when I pulled the one out of the bus I parted out this summer.

You might also think about your switches as sources for shorts. Your light switch and your flasher unit have a lot to do with other components...at least they do in the '64-'71 buses. Your ignition switch can be worn internally and cause shorts...at least that was the case in my '71 bus. The fact that your bus was converted to 12 volts would make me want to inspect any remaining 6 volt components, such as the flasher unit? dimmer switch? I have seen a flasher unit that sat under a leak and got water in it, rusted internally.

Also, don't overlook the ground strap from your tranny to the body of the bus. If you crawl under the bus at the front of the tranny (front is front of bus), you'll see the ground strap on the driver's side.

I'm glad you've checked your starter connections. Make sure those wires are cleanly attached. They'll fry if you have a loose attachment...and you'll barely be able to crank your engine over.

Good luck! Joe
