&lt;&lt; The ratty original one has been in my bus ever since.  Never have gotten 
around to replacing it but I don't listen to the radio much anymore anyway.  
I do need to find an original one for my resto though.  Anyone know of one? &gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
The best speakers in our opinion are the originals, especially the Blaupunkt 
speakers sound fantastic.  There are places that can replace the paper cone 
if the speaker still works.   Eric&amp;Barb
