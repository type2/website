I have 1 of those odd ball bay window pulleys, they are cast backs, balanced
with a stamped steel front, I'll dig it out and check the offset, it also
came with a cast STEEL generator stand, hows that for durability.

&gt; Additional note:
&gt; We know the pulleys should be aligned BUT....
&gt; Generator pulley is outboard of the the crank pulley.  There is no
&gt; material to be removed on the generator pulley to allow it to go inboard
&gt; anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; what kind of Generator do you have.  there is a longer one that was used
on 
&gt; 71 buses, more amps,  and requires a certain kind of generator pulley, or 
&gt; it'll be offset.   what are the numbers on your generator?   
&gt; 

I dont think its the pulley thats different but the back plate that the
generator mounts to. There is one that is offset inward about 1/4&quot;.
