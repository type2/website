In the first message that I replied to about the axle flange gasket
replace I stated that you do not have to slit the gaskets/shims to
fit them onto the transaxle.  Boy, am I a knucklehead or what?
Of course you have to slit them to get them around the axle and
tube.  Don't know what I was thinking of when I said that.  Well,
I am certainly looking forward to downloading my mail and see
who calls me on that one!
