Subject: Bus Tow Bar

--part1_b0.22d222a1.29b11743_boundary

Hi to all.  New to the list.  

I checked the archives and saw a myriad of messages regarding bus tow bars.  
I was looking for a bus tow bar and found one supposedly manufactured in 
Texas (don't know if that matters) for sale for $100 here in California by a 
private party.  Looking for pros and cons and what to stay away from.  I also 
have a bug, and have already had to flatbed the bus one time already to the 
shop.  

Not particularly looking to tow very long distances, but if I had to, would 
it be a problem and what is the informed consensus of the group on maximum 
distances to tow in this fashion.  I assume (hate to use that word) that I 
can also tow a bug with the saw type of bus bar.

TIA
