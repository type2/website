Subject: JOSHUA WAS RIGHT ...

Been busy printing my &quot;ammo&quot; for court when I ran across Joshua's post
regarding the &quot;thunk&quot; noise.  The noise the MFH wanted to fix by pulling the
axel and replacing &quot;the flower&quot; for close to $400 .. maybe the price was
right but it wouldn't have fixed the problem.

1 broken bolt and 3 loose ones on ONE SIDE !!

diane,
was it ever verified that the sound you heard was the engine flopping around
back there or are you using your imagination based on the noises you hear.
if a couple of your spring plate bolts are loose it could sound like your
engine or tranny flopping around back there when you shift.  ive missed a
lot of this thread so i may be way off.  i check those on every new bus i
get and they always seem to be loose.
