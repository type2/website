Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

I have found SUV drivers to be the same.

&gt; I have developed an opinion on truckers.  Most of
&gt; them are selfish crybabies
&gt; and they take chances on the road like pulling out
&gt; in front of me,
&gt; tail-gating, flashing lights, and driving like they
&gt; truly rule the road.  I
&gt; deal with them daily with my job and get into verbal
&gt; arguments with most of
&gt; them.  The nice truckers are in the minority IMHO. 
&gt; And I'm technically a
&gt; trucker too as I drive a flatbed with my job so I'm
&gt; basically denouncing
&gt; myself.  I think they are under stress and pressure
&gt; to get their jobs done
&gt; but when I tell them how long it will be before they
&gt; get unloaded, they
&gt; crybaby and call dispatch, which in turn calls my
&gt; boss, and then I get my
&gt; ass chewed out for not hurrying up and kissing their
&gt; ass.  So I definitely
&gt; have a thing against them.
