&gt;Motor starts and runs   BUT  If you accelerate the motor shakes more then I
think it should,  and lots more than it ever has.
&gt;No oil being thrown, or smoke from the exhaust.  ( I hope that is a plus in
my favor)
&gt;Plugs are all oil free, and performance did not improve after cleaning
&gt;Retarded and advanced timing and no improvement.
&gt;The shake isn't a misfire kinda thing but almost seems to be in a
horizontal direction.

Sounds like the flywheel may have loosened up. Does the vibration change
when you step on the clutch?
Temporary fix (if this proves to be the problem) is to re-torque the
flywheel. This probably won't help for very long as the dowel holes in the
flywheel and crank will now be elongated. To fix properly, the flywheel and
crank will have to be re-doweled. This is a job for somebody familiar with
the procedure, although you can buy a drill jig and try it yourself.
