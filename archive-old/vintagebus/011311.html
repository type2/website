Hi,

My right rear brake began sticking and dragging. I have honed out the wheel
cylinder, reassembled everything and found that upon trying to bleed the
line, it wouldn't bleed. I tried to blow out the line with compressed air,
to no avail. Next I removed the flexible hose from over the axle and found
that I couldn't blow through it with 120psi air.

Are there some orifices or check valves inside the hose that could clog or
stick?
Anyone with answers?  Thanks.

replace the flexible hose.   these fail when too old.  collapse inside,
causing dragging brakes,  work intermittantley,   even burst sometimes (been
there, had e brake,  was a PITA)   replace both rears.  heck, replace the
front ones too.   These are often overlooked brake parts that may well be
original to the car,  and overdue for replacement.  new ones are what 10 to
15 bucks.
