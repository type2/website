NQ - a Real Character!

But then lets face it everyone on the list is a &quot;Character&quot;  you can not
drive around in a 40 year old vehicle and spend a couple hours a day reading
about VW minutia and be considered mainstream.  I hope someone is saving all
of NQ posts, they should be put together and read is literature.  The way is
personality and (I mean this in a very respectful sense) a certain
unassuming naiveté comes through in his written adventures is truly
literary.

But criticizing others is great for this list - lets just not get too
personal.
