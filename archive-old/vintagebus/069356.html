&gt; What brand and wattage are everyone using in the Buses&gt;  Are you doing the

Hi Dave,
When we switched to the 55/60W H-4s the wiring in our 1963 SC and 1960 walk 
thru panel camper conversion both had headlight switches almost to smoking 
and the SC had several areas of the fuse box so hot you burn your fingers on 
the clips the fuses seat into.  The main power wire going into the fuse box 
singed and several wires running into and out of the headlight switches 
singed also and you could burn your fingers touching the headlight switch 
shaft or the fuses after running a while.  We soldered all riveted 
connections, cleaned and applied dielectric grease to the slider pieces 
inside the headlight switches and soldered all the clips in the fuse box 
together and again applied dielectric grease.  Results, no hot spots in the 
wiring any longer, plus other functions of the electrical system like wipers, 
running lights, turn signal, etc. all are working better and brighter due to 
getting the full amount of power to them!  Installing relays for the 
headlights will not improve/fix to the full function of the other electrical 
parts in your bus!!!
  So before you install the H-4s we suggest checking your wiring system from 
the back at the battery all the way forward and then back to the engine and 
starter solinoid with a voltmeter for any voltage droppage.  Then solder and 
clean the fuse box and heallight switch, see the type2 library that we helped 
Matt Roberds write up on the headlight switch repair.
    Even with the stock 50/55W sealed beam one can have much better lights by 
doing the above steps.  We have a 1961 bug that has been in the family since 
at least the early 1970s and never had good headlights.  Even installed a 
single H-4 with no improvement.  Turned out at one time someone had taken a 
front fender off and when rewiring the headlight on that side when 
reinstalling the fender the wiring got switched around.  Result, both high 
and low beam running at the same time and since the electrical system could 
not keep up with this double draw we had dull yellow candle light type of 
lighting!
  We worked on a nice two tone green OG 80,000 mile 1958 Westie that you 
almost certainly have seen pictures of it on the internet or perhaps at West 
Coast VW meets towing a tear drop camping trailer behind.  This turned out to 
have a snafu of the dimmer switch only delievering 4 volts of the 6 volts to 
the beam selected while the other two volts went to the beam not selected.  
This dimmer switch had been new when installed only a year before!  Also 
turned out the NOS regulator of this bus even though only a year in use was 
not putting out the full voltage to properly charge the battery.  Plus 
without ground wiring on the taillights the signals were both dim and 
additionally worthless at night due to one taillight running light would 
flicker when the other taillight was signalling a turn!
  Once we were done the Westie owner could drive at night with great vision 
where before he did not drive at night at all due to the lack of lighting, 
and we could easily follow him with no problem because his taillights were 
bright with no flickering running lights.
  This very last weekend we went to an all types of auto swap meet and picked 
up a large bag full of 55/60W H-4 bulbs at less than half price of the FLAPS 
up here.  Also picked up a hand full of 90/100W H-4 bulbs and installed one 
in passenger side in our 1960 panel to try out in the next little while.
  Hey Mat, since you are our electrical wizard.  Do you know if the size 
wiring going from the battery to the headlights is technically of big enough 
diameter for 100W 12 volt bulbs?
