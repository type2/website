&lt;&lt; Hello list---
 I just got a package of various parts I bought from a guy who was clearing 
 some stuff out. There is a church - key decklid in the stash that has an 
 emblem just above the license light area that says &quot;1500&quot;(but it's a 
 different &quot;1500&quot; emblem than a bug--It's squarer  like the volkswagen emblen 
 on the back of later year splits) ---it is an original paint decklid and the 
 emblem even has those stock little O-rings on the inside. Is this a decklid 
 an original for those 1500 optioned busses in the earlier 60's-(it is a 
 church key lid?) It's interesting and I just wan't some info?
  &gt;&gt;
yup- that's it- 63 or 64
