&lt;&lt; It's a far flung idea but it might be neat to have a full time camera on so

 Any ideas along this route? &gt;&gt;

If the funding doesn't come through, how bout the picture of the day?
Every day take a picture of yourselves and/or the bus with the interesting 
people and places you see. If you can't upload them enroute, they would make 
a neat addition to your website.

What part of California are you going to?
