&gt; Comments?

&gt; Just curious as it's been for sale for a long time at various prices.

Nice truck! Still seems priced high, but what do I know?  What was he asking
before?
Can't see if it has the right rear deck lid/taillights/etc. but everything
else on there looks pretty correctomundo?

I haven't seen it in person, but it looks very clean/straight.

Pax,

Tom Buese-too cheap/in a hurry to drive it, but wouldn't mind owning it.
