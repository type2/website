Subject: RE: [VB] Shocks for a 63singlecab

&gt;   One thing people need to realize is the valving in shocks and what they
&gt; are desigined to do. I have tried most brands (major) on my buses and have
&gt; found that different shocks do different jobs.

what about KYBs?? i have always used them partly from habit and unaware of other alt. i used
bilstein on the mercedes but because that was what was already there. how do kyb's compare in the
greater scheme of things.?
