Subject: Re: [VB] bus joint/group ownership?

&gt;   I was wondering if anybody out there has or does own a bus with another
person or people?
&gt; The amatauer airplane people do this.  Since alot of people don't depend
on their bus for regular transport -or- have their own bus for that, could
it make sens to

I thought it would make sense to share a bus that was stationed on Europe.
Take turns using it etc.. Could have it stationed at ... maybe ... a VW shop
who made sure it was always ready to go and people could fly to Europe and
use it at their convenience - it would make a trip really affordable for ...
po' folks like me.
