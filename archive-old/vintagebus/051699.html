Subject: RE: [VB] Front Shocks????

Your shock should have a bolt going through an 'eyelet' on both ends.

The other Dave wrote: OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks
from a Bus parts company.  The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom
and a stud top (that goes through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to
tell them they sent the wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a
57 to 67 Bus.  They tell me what I received is the correct shock for a 67
Bus.  My 66 has a shock that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me
that they've sold 1000's of these shock and had none returned.  So if this
is the correct shock.  What's going on with my frontend?  The picture in the
Bently shows a shock with eyelits on both ends.  They tell me the Haynes
shows the shock on 67 like the one they sent me.
