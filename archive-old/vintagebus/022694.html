I'm fairly lucky in that I've found (or the bus came with) most of the
RHD-specific stuff that I need.  This include the 6-leg middle seat, foot
rest, pedal pans (there are two) and NOS gas and brake pedals.  The only
thing I'd really like to get is a RHD clutch pedal.

&gt;Cool RHD busses cost more...no??   Hmmm....you didn't want kids anyway right?
