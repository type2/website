&lt;&lt; Does anyone know where to get a skylight roof section.  I really need the
 passenger front but could use drivers front skylight sheet metal too.
 
 Seems like this may turn into a &quot;holy grail&quot; part, but, all things with
 time...right?
  &gt;&gt;
Are you looking for just a small piece , because i've got a 21 window roof 
section with the sunroof opening cut at the gutter.
i also have a sunroof section w/o the skylights.
