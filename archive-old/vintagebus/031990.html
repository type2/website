Ever do one of those projects where it seems like there is more than the usual
share of problems, snafus, and difficulties?

After taking the brackets off the rear bumper for my 61  deluxe, and
'adjusting' them with a hammer, I reattached them.  I kept in mind that the
beams the bumpers bolts to are not parallel with the sides of the bus, but
rather slant together as they go forward, and the brackets should follow that
line.   Bolted the bumper on, which now attached.   Alright.   The bus finally
has a rear slant bumper with deluxe trim and overriders and splash pans. 

Now the engine lid catches on the bumper.  As this is a beautiful engine lid,
I do not want to mess it up.     I will proceed to jump up and down on the
bumper to been it down a tad.  But it is just kinda another thing to do.
Jeez.   

Maybe I should put better speakers in it too.  I have some.

Clara
