&gt;&gt; I have been into VW's about 20 years now, 30 years
&gt; &gt; if you count the bus my Mom bought new.  Over that
&gt; &gt; time I have met a lot of VW people.  They have come
&gt; &gt; from all sorts of social and economic backgrounds.
&gt; &gt; However, there seems to be a few similarities among
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pack rats!  Man do these people accumulate stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Non-conformist.  Even the &quot;corporate&quot; type VW nuts
&gt; &gt; are different in some way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Fanatical.  What percentage of your T-shirts have
&gt; &gt; some sort of VW on them?  What percentage of the
&gt; &gt; walls in your house have something VW oriented
&gt; &gt; hanging on them?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you think of anymore?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
