Subject: Re: [VB] International Travel Questions

If there is a protest against Americans, it will only be in big cities 
Frankfurt, Hannover, Stuttgart and then they are held in the middle of the 
town.  If you encounter one turn around and walk away.  We lived in Frankfurt 
for 8 years were they had monthly Anti American protest, never had any 
problems with the Germans that demonstrated, we just turned around and walked 
away.
Go have fun and don't sweat the small stuff.  The Police handle the 
demonstrators very well.  
For all you going to Bad Camberg have fun
