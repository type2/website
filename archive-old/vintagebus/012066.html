Subject: BBB III camp set-up challange
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

it's allready started and BUSES by THE BRIDGE III
is still 2 1/2 months away, is it the cash prize or the secret trophy for the best camp set-up
or is it the ego knowing that you have won the first best camp set-up prize, alas only time will tell, the challanges keep coming in so this ought to be good, all we need is one of the vw rags to show up, if not it would be to bad if the usa had to read about it in volks world,  help put the pressure on the local rags and may the winner be famous to the rest of the vw world for knowing how to camp. 

ps, we have contacted a local hotel as our host
hotel for those who wish to come and not camp
it is within walking distance to the show, or a quick bike ride, more info soon or email me

pss, still working on the LAUGHLIN charter bus
so far the time for the trip seems around 4 pm
friday returning 1 am sat morning, we need input on this to make the arrangements, otherwise there
are trips all weekend if you want to wing it alone

psss, get your valve covers tuned-up, stock, modified and unlimited valve cover racing presented by hot dog fred and crew, many thanks

ronnie
