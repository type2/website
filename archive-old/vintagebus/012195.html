Hey all,

A while back, while slowing down for a stop sign and riding my clutch to
keep my old exhaust system from backfiring, I thought:

Back in the drag strip days...my Must_at_ng sounded similar on deceleration
with open headers.  Also, on cool Fall mornings, many folks would not run
their cars for fear of the valve damage possible with open header exhaust
systems. 

Come to think of it, Vw vehicles are about the only vehicles on the road
that have such a short exhaust system....kind of like open headers when
they are in average (poor) condition.

Hmmm.....cool air (Winter coming) + open header (poor exhaust condition) =
valve damage (common Vw engine failure).

Arent you glad you replaced that exhaust system before it got too cold?  I
am!
