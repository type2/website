Subject: SVIIs show in Carlsbad

Hi list-

My kids and I went to the Strictly Vintage IIs show at Bob Baker VW 
in Carlsbad this weekend.  It was a beautiful day, and the show gave 
me an excuse to drive my bus a short distance.

Just wanted to pass on that I thought the show was well organized, 
well run, and a lot of fun.  The &quot;gatekeepers&quot; even talked me into 
bringing my DC on the lot and showing it for the relatively short 
time my kids and I were there.

There were more bugs and ghias than busses, but many of the busses 
that were there were really spectacular.

Thanks for a good time, and well done!
