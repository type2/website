Subject: All-Time Favorite Brake Cylinder To Fail Would Be...


As regards the &quot;all-time brake cylinder to fail would be &lt;insert position
here&gt;,... I'm thinkin'...

the Right Rear.

The right rear to fail, out of the blue, without warning, has *always* been
the one for me.

Several times, in 25 years of bus driving.. and in not the same bus..
Kaaah --- Schuchhh... REEEEEMMMMM! Poof!.

Drip. Drip. Drip.  Pump (so what) Pump (so what) Pump (so what) .

Is there a reason for this? My search of the archives was nonproductive,
though it might be my search at the moment, not the archive, one would
think.

Still, ... don't like that nasty sound, and brake fluid centrifugin'
everywhere else that it definitely needs not to be in a brake system
replaced entirely in 2000, whilst one is careening to a destination far less
dramatic than instant oblivion.

Insight?

Craig
