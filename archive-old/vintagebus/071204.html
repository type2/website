Subject: Nasty Dusty

Well, it's that time again, here in N. Cal, and I'm sure most other places, to
have to think about the huge amount of dust generated by rocks being crushed
together under the wheels of our buses on dirt roads.

I've got a 1.5 mile dirt road/driveway, and it wreaks havoc on my engine
compartment.

Last year, I went down to the hardware store and got me some of those furnace
filters with the black plastic ribbing.  I folded them in half, with a layer
of finer filter paper sandwiched between the halves, and used zip-ties to hold
them together.

I took these modified furnace filters and placed them on the inside of the air
intake vents on my doublecab, and held them in place with those big black and
silver paper clips.

I used them only on the dirt road, which I travel at 15-20 mph in 2nd gear,
and then removed them before I hit the asphalt.

They helped a bit, but the amount of dust that fell off of them when I removed
them from the engine compartment almost negated any gains.

So this year, I'll bind rare earth magnets into the outer edges of the
filters, and simply plop them into place before driving.  (the perimeter of
the filters will be of soft rubber so as to effect a seal, and the magnets
will be coated or wrapped to protect paint)

Banging them together to shed excess dust before throwing them in the back of
the truck will be harder to do, since the magnets will stick to each other,
but all in all, the amount of dust entering the engine compartment and
challenging the effectiveness of the air cleaner and making it a nuisance to
even check the oil or adjust the engine will be reduced to a manageable
amount.

Just thought I'd share...

Gene
