&lt;&lt; Why is this happening?  The pushrods seem to be of equal length.  Every
other valve has lash (though the rocker arms come within 2mm of the valve
stems on most).  Tried swapping the rocker assemblies but no change.  Is the
valve stem too long?!?   Can I shim up the rocker assemblies (I've seen the
shims at the FLAPS, &amp; read something about them somewhere) without causing
other wierdness?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
Check out your local engine rebuild shop or wrecking yard for shorter
pushrods.  You want ones that end up having the adjusting screws straight with
the valve stems halfway through thier travel.  Ony when you have at least
something close can you even think of shimming or shorten the rods if
absolutely needed.  Right now what you have sounds way, way too long.
