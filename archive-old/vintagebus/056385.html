Subject: Re: [VB] Pitting

Makes sense. Metal body filler is only fiberglass resin, talc, and metal
flakes instead of fiberglass strands. When you heat any type of filler, it
softens-up on you. I can't believe this would work with powdercoating.

&gt; I think Eastwood sells either Metal to Metal or All Metal body filler it
is
&gt; supposed to be like an aluminum filler and they say it will work with
there
&gt; powder coat system, but we have tried using it on engine tin and heating
it
&gt; in the oven and it tried to lift. But it seems to work well on body metal
&gt; filling deep pits on my buses rain gutters.
