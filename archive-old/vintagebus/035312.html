&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever done a definitive study on the Binz beast? A history? 
Stats? 
 Options? , etc., etc?  &gt;&gt;

I have been researching the Binz since buying mine (#187) a few years back 
and this is what I know so far.

The first Binz crew cab was made for the owners of a plant nursery who needed 
a covered are to carry delicate plants and/or worker in.  I believe that Binz 
was a barndoor.  From there, Binz did the conversions for individuals and for 
VW.  

*I* believe most of the Binz conversions were done for VW.  These were late 
'57 and '58 model year trucks which is why most Binz are '58s.  These were 
sold through the dealer network as SO 16 (special option 16).  For these, 
single cabs in primer, with belly pans, were sent to Binz to be converted.  
Binz did the conversion and painted the trucks...and a terrible paint job it 
was, they didn't even pull the ash tray out when painting the interior!!  
Most (all?) of these were Dove Blue.  The rear seat was an option, so not 
having a rear seat doesn't make it incorrect!!

The other way to get a Binz was to take your single cab to Binz and have them 
convert it for you.  This is why Binz other than the '58 model year are 
found.  It is completely probable that someone took either a BD single cab or 
a post '58 single cab to Binz and had it converted.  I'm not sure if belly 
pans were added to these or not.  Anyone? 

I have been told that there were between 700 - 900 Binz conversion done.  To 
date I have found 10 Binz crew cabs and have production number information on 
most of them.  The highest production number I have found is #205.  Given 
this I can in no way validate the higher production numbers.  To have 10 
samples all fall within the first 25% or so is unlikely as the ones made 
later in the run would have a greater chance in surviving.  The only thing I 
can say for sure is that at least 205 were made and very probably less than 
700.  This puts the production equal to or less than the Hebmueler.  Since 
the Heb was a pleasure car and the Binz was a work truck, probably fewer Binz 
have survived.  Based on what the Hebmeulers and BD 23 windows are bringing, 
the Binz has been historically **way** under valued.  Binz ought to be a 
*minimum* of a $20K vehicle.  FWIW, if the BD crew cab in question does turn 
out to be a Binz it should set a new price record for a bus should the owner 
decides to sell it.  

IF YOU HAVE A BINZ OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES, PLEASE CONTACT ME!!!  Still 
collecting data trying to verify what I have been told and what my hunches 
are.  (Information will be kept confidential at your request)
