Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] volkswagen microbuses calendar

No   Ronnie of www.Type2parts_dot_com just bought that bus and sent me the
pictures to put in the calendar. I don't think he has possession of it yet
though.  And it could be very well his.  Ronnie is going to use it for his
new parts bus to sell his stuff.

&gt; That October bus-commercial van is from Melbourne Australia, Toorak Rd,
&gt; Toorak, dry cleaners.  Must be a Rob King contribution!  The Aussies
&gt; used to do funny things with their busses.  I used to see lots of them
&gt; when I lived there for two years in the late 60's.

&gt; Why buy as calendar when you can have one free from here?&gt;?!!.  Little
&gt; personalized for Buskatiers but there are some good busses there too.
&gt; No
&gt; Vanagon's though.  It is a PDF based calendar so you need Adobe's PDF
&gt; reader
