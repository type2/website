&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jason,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Did you check the TO bearing to be equally side to side in relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the input shaft?
&gt; &gt; No.
&gt; &gt; I did notice there was some wiggle on the arm, but I thought it would
&gt; &gt; center itself when it starts spinning. No?
&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt; There should be some side to side wiggle of the TO bearing to allow self
&gt; centering, but we have found several arms with both aftermarket and NOS ones
&gt; to have the arms way to far to the left or at least the inside bellhousing
&gt; mounting C-clip to far to the right or perhaps worn too much where the C-clip
&gt; seats against the left side of the bellhousing!  This required us to aquire a
&gt; stock of thin washers to shim the TO fork to the right.

Also, you can have the left hand snap ring come out of its groove,
allowing the shaft to move to the left.  It only takes a few mm to make a
heck of a noise. The return spring will keep the shaft from moving too
far, which hides the problem to external inspection.

I safety-wire this snap ring to make sure that it stays tightly in the
groove.

George
