I remember this as being the exact response by many in the late 50's early 
60's to the Beetle and especially the Bus. The Ghia was even looked down at!

Either way, as some have already said, it would make for a great daily driver 
and still keep you in the VW family. I have a NB and a '59 ragtop and they 
look cool in the driveway together. I think the new bus along side my '67 
will look as cool!

&lt;&lt; I would drive a lowered
 412 before I would let one of those mutant Hondas darken my driveway. How
 anyone could pony up the price of a couple of restored buses to be the
 millionth on their block..... &gt;&gt;
