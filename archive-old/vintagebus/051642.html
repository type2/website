Subject: CE Aluminum Safari's  first impression

    I just recieved a set of C E aluminum Safaris for a customer (he ordered
direct) and I must say WOW. The frames are absolutly awesome. They are
extremely rigid, no flex and are DOUBLE WALLED like OG ones. The only thing
I don't like are the hindges are SCREWED on instead of welded so you have
screw heads showing and he hasn' t changed the hindge holes yet so they
won't bolt up to OG plates.  Overall impression on a scale of 1 to 10 I
would give them a 8/9.
