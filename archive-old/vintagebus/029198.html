&gt;What do you guys think about eBay sellers asking for tax on their purchases?
I had one ebay seller do that, and when I asked for his FTB tax ID, I never
heard
&gt;back.  
&gt;
I've always assumed it was a scam, worse than those losers who say $15 for
shipping on a small item.  I've never bought anything from my state on eBay
but I intended to proceed as you have done, ask for the tax id and verify
it is valid before making payment.
