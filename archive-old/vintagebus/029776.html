Subject: Sapphire Radio Score

I have stayed away from the non-working sapphire radios on ebay and the like for
obvious reasons.

I was cleaning out cabinets today and found that I have Sapphire I, II, III
maybe IV &amp; V schematics from Sams.  I guess I had better look at those
non-working radios and put my test bench to work bringing them back to life.

Are the Sapphire's the radios installed stateside by the dealers and Blaupunkt
if the car came with a radio from Germany?

With all the attention to what was factory, dealer and aftermarket installed,
what's what?

Scott
