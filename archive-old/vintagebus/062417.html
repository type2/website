Subject: [VB] Flaps position?


How can I tell if my flaps (air vanes) are open or closed while the
motor is installed in the bus.  I can reach around on the right side and
feel them.  When the bus is hot, should I still be able to move them? 
What's a good test to make sure the thermostat is keeping them open when
the engine is up to operating temp?

Thanks.

Steve

Steve, I use a white marking pen and mark the close angle and open angle of
the flap lever on the right side, or generator side, above 1&amp;2. In years
past I used a little light circuit wired at my dash with a twisted triple to
the engine compartment and a leaf SPST leaf switch mounted on the fan
housing by the flap lever. When the flaps were closed I had a red light and
when they were 3/4 to all the way open I had a green light. Real convenient
to tell where your flaps are and to track down a bad thermostat.
