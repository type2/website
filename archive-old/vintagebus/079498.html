&gt; Gary,
&gt; 
&gt; To the best of my knowledge Bugs never had 14&quot; wheels, so those would be 
&gt; bus. Bus 15&quot; wheels have four &quot;slots&quot; in them. 15&quot; Early Bug rims came in two 
&gt; styles; Smoothies- No holes in rims at all. (all bugs from 54-65). 66-67 bug 
&gt; rims are 15&quot; and have holes all the way around them, similar to the chrome 
&gt; &quot;porsche style&quot; rims you can buy.

Unless the 14&quot; rim is solid with no thin slots. That would be a Thing rim. 
(Thanks to Beto I was educated.)
