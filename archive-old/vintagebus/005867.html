Well Volks - I've taken a week off from my bus project - that's it - cold
turkey.  I've given this a lot of thought and despite the fact that I don't
have the money, I've decided to try rebuilding my first engine.  The whole
thing kind of pivots on whether or not my current set of heads is
rebuildable or not but I'll know tonight for sure or not.

Is it best to buy a whole kit or just by the parts as you need them?  Money
IS a factor here.  I know you can guy whole kits with reground lifters,
cams, etc. but is that necessarily the best way to do things?

Thanks for the advice...
