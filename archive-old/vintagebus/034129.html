Now you find it, I just spent over a hundred bucko's there getting birch
veneered luan 4X8 sheets of paneling for my 1960 DD panel/camper, going to
do it Sundial style since it never was a westy, got most of the wood cut
(thanks to vwhowards patterns) and am ready to insulate (useing alumunum
sided plastic wrap stuff, like your parts come in, they have it at ACE
hardware for 45 dollars per 50 foot roll), it has the same insulation rating
as fiberglass and since it's plastic it won't absorb water, pretty cool
stuff. VWhoward just did his camper with this stuff, doubled layered, and
you can really tell the resonate difference and can't wait to see how it
works in our 120 degree summers.

 Baltic Birch Panels


Hi Volks,

Just wanted to let everyone know that I found a source for baltic birch
5X5's.  I have been trying
to get my sources together to complete the face lift of my '70 Westy.
Over the last two years I
have followed posts about the different type of suppliers but have yet
to find any on the east
coast.  Well, I was picking up some hardboard to make some door panels
and I there it was on
a little sign by the wood cutting service.  Where you ask?  At all
places Home Depot!  I was
very psyched to find this out.  The employee thought I was a little nuts
for being so excited :0)  It
is special order, but a 5X5 sheet is something like $17 .  Just thought
I'd let you all know.
