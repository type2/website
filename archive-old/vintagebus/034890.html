Hi Todd,
It sounds like you have no spark, since you did not even get a back fire when
you poured a litle fuel into the carb.  So take off one of you spark plug
cable off one of the spark plugs.  Then use one of you spare plugs hooked into
the cable and have someone turn the engine over with the key while you hold
the spark plug against metal so it is grounded.  If you do not get a spark
jumping across the spark plug's electrode then you need to check your ignition
system for the fault.  Eric &amp; Barb
