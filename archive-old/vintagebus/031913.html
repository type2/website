Subject: gastank restoration
To: getsmarx_at_hotmail_dot_com, VintagVW_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I wanted to restore the gastank in my 57 bus.
It was undercoated at the dealership and Im getting sick of looking at the 
undercoating.
Any pointers?
Should I take it and have it sandblasted?
I heard there are places that can split it apart and reseal it, then 
powdercoat it.
Im not too keen on the powdercoating idea and rather go with grey primer.
Or should I use paint stripper to removed the old paint, then sand it and 
primer it.
Any hints on mixing up the factory looking blue-grey primer?
Any safety precautions I should be taking or should I just make sure its 
clean and empty?
Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
Greg
