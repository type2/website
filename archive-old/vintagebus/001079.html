Hi All,

I got my bumpers back from the chrome shop today and all I can say is WOW
deep beautiful liquid chrome!  The guy did an excellant job of straightening
it and filling the pea shooter holes that the PO cut in the rear one.  If
you know the holes were there, you can see it but it's hard.  He has also
done about half of the little bits and pieces too with more to be sent off
in a week or so.

Anyway, I would recommend this guy to anyone in the Portland/Northwest area
(or even further).

I really don't know him from Adam but he did a great job.
