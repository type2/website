Subject: oil cooler seal
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id PAA69798

I am planning on replacing my oil cooler seal soon, i just ordered 
new seals from ronnie.

I am pretty sure there is a leak somewhere near the oil cooler(oil is 
dripping out from the left side of the shroud.

I have a 1600, i am not sure what kind of fan shroud-i know i don't 
have  a doghouse oil cooler. The cooler is inside the fan shroud.

when replacing this seal what should i be aware of...ronnie said he 
would send all the seals i could use, i guess there are a couple 
different types depending on the oil cooler. So do i just use the one 
that seems to match the connection best? 

I have never taken the fan shroud apart...to see the oil cooler. My 
plan of attack
1) remove engine
2)remove fan shroud
3)remove oil cooler
4)clean up area/wipe down
5)install new seals
6)reattach oil cooler
7)fan shroud replacement then engine

when replaing the oil cooler, how much should i torque the nuts?

I understand i don't use any type of sealant on the seals(does that 
make sense?)

I think i may have to remove the generator to take the fan shroud off, 
is this correct? 

what should i be aware of while doing this whole operation?

Thanks
kevin

gauge report coming soon...
