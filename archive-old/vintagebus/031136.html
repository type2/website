Just put that one back in. It already has a nut on it. 8^)

Seriously, any old 8mm stud should be OK as long as it's the right
length. I usually put red locktite on exhaust studs that come out. I
haven't had that problem since I started using stainless nuts, though. I
know some folks use brass nuts too. I think the main thing is to just
not use plain steel so the stud and nut don't rust together.

&gt; While removing the old rusty exhaust from the 1600 SP I was surprised
&gt; to find the bolts on the studs to the heads very easy to remove even
&gt; though they had been in place for at least 12 years. Then I got to
&gt; the last stud. It creaked and moaned. Terror washed over me as I
&gt; imagined the struggle to drill out the broken stud and ultimately
&gt; taking it to the machine shop. Chad brought the torch over from the
&gt; work bench and advised that use a little heat. After getting the nut
&gt; hot it began to turn. A squeak here and a groan there. After a few
&gt; turns it was clear that the stud was coming out of the head with the
&gt; nut firmly attached to it. I figure that was better then breaking it
&gt; off :) I suspect I can get a matching stud at the fastener supply
&gt; house but is there anything special to consider such as hardness of
&gt; the stud or the material it is made from? Are there any special
&gt; considerations to installing such as using loctite ?
