Subject: [VB] Is this 67 Worth Restoring? 
Message-ID: &lt;004601bf2a19$d8f447a0$d2c2193f_at_larbo&gt;

Hi. I have been lurking on this list for several years, while my 67 Deluxe
sat neglected in the garage for lack of time to work on it.   I now have the
time to begin restoration, but before I get too far down the road I would
like the group's input on whether she is worth restoring, or whether I
would be better off selling her and getting something a little further
along.   All comments/suggestions are welcome, both positive and negative.
You can see her at :

Thanks.

Larry
