Well, I took the heads to the machine shop, and it looks like a broken gasket
is the problem with #3.  Unfortunately, the other head is cracked.  Both heads
have been rebuilt before, and they say they might be able to fix the cracked
head.  Is this sketchy?

Still don't know what to do with chipped cylinder.
