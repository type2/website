Subject: T3 oil cooler results...Ronnie???

I remember Ronnie was gonna do some real world tests using a T3 oil cooler 
instead of a T1 oil cooler. Did you ever get any real world results from 
that Ronnie? A buddy of mine was building an engine and I noticed he had a 
T3 oil cooler in his doghouse shroud. He said he used it 'cause it was 
there and was a not broken. I told him the theory on how it MIGHT cool 
better. I showed him a T1 oil cooler and the differences in the fins.

So what was the verdict on that little mod?
