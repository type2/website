&gt; Seriously, where have all the middle seats gone, if
&gt; they aren't in any of
&gt; the busses I've seen for sale?  Is anyone sitting on
&gt; one right now?

Somebody put one of them in my tow vehicle.  It's now
the front seat in my 1955 Ch_at_vy panel truck.  Ronnie
got a part off it a while back.
