Subject: What should I do?

After coming home and reading all the posts, I think I'm about to call off
the trip to BNNTA.  I really wanted to go in the worst way - it's gonna be
so much fun.  Damn.

I'm concerned about the dual valve spring situation.  Had I known that I
should have removed them, I would have done it while the heads were sitting
here in the box.  I didn't know that you can flatten a new cam (and actually
I have a stock reground 110) with the dual springs.  I just tried to use my
in-car spring removal tool and I can't get underneath the spring far enough
(like on a stock head) to remove the tension so I can remove the inner
spring.  The inner spring won't compress because the tongs on the tool are
only deep enough to grab one spring.  I could take the bug but it just
wouldn't be as fun.  I'm running on only 4 hours of sleep right now and my
joints ache like crazy between having to install the engine myself, being on
my feet all weekend, and then hauling shingles and sheetrock at work.  I'm
beat.

Has anyone actually managed to run dual springs and pulled it off without
flattening a cam?  Dammit - after all I went through these past few days to
try to make it and then this.  Makes you appreciate stock stuff more and
more...
