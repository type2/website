I've been wanting to do some empi 5s and have checked the archives and all I can gather is Eagle USA made empi's are the best and that they will fit the rear bignut with some shimming or something.&quot;

I have seen busses in the VW rags with the 5-spokes and regular fenders.  The stock bus wheels are 14&quot; or 15&quot; (yes some way old 16&quot;) by 5.5&quot;.  The 5-spokes are 15&quot; by 5.5&quot;, but I do not know the offset.  I know the wheels will fit the drums without a problem, just be sure to get a center cap otherwise you leave a lot of drum exposed - yucky.  The front I do not see any problem with, the rear is the tough part due to the offset.  You may need to get skinny meats to tuck under the stock wheel wells.

My advice is to pick up a VW rag that has a bus with the 5-spokes and see what tires are being run.  Or there is British book called something like &quot;VW Bus Customs and Classics&quot; that would provide that information.  I bought the book a few years ago and it sucks (IMHO), but it has some good pictures.  Oh wait, when I refer to a British publication I should say tyres :)

The Eagle 5-spokes are very nice though.  They can be had cheaper if you shop a local tire shop though.  I got quoted $165 each at a local shop.  Also bone yards might prove a good source if you like to get dirty and/or want to polish them.

Good Luck,
