I drove my 911 thru a huge puddle one time - the water was higher than the 
bottoms of the doors.  The puddle was at least 50' in length.  I basically
set the hand throttle and plowed thru it - I didn't have an out.

Immediately after existing the puddle, I approached a red light.
Stepping on the brakes had about as much effect as turning on the radio.
I set the ebrake, and jammed my foot on the brake as hard as I could.
I managed to stop, but literally inches from the guy in front of me!
I think the only thing that saved me was the two extra shoes in the 911
parking brake!
