&gt; Any tips on putting the vent wing seal into the window frame ?
&gt;
&gt; the rubber always seems too hard to push in the slot,  I have the same
&gt; problem with early bug ones to....
&gt;
&gt; any hints ?.......thanks

Yes, Thom and I were discussing this one at Kelley Park.
Use 2 small C clamps. First, fold the rubber over the top exposed (rear)
edge of the glass and clamp. Then pull the rubber all the way around the
surfaces that go into the frame and around onto the rear edge again at the
bottom. Stretch the rubber slightly as you do this, then clamp again on the
lower rear edge. The stretching reduces the thickness of the rubber. You
should not have to stretch it very much. After you have it clamped, then
spray with dry silicone lubricant. It should still be a push to get it in,
but a gentle push. Once you have it in the frame, release the clamps. Rough
trim the rubber, leaving at least 1/8 in. out of the frame all around. Let
it set at least overnight, this will allow the rubber to retract fully into
the frame. After the rubber is fully retracted, you may trim flush with the
frame. Trimming too soon will cause the rubber to retract below the edge of
the frame, creating a gap for gunk to collect in.
