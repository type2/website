Subject: '59 Kombi...locks swaps and stuff

I was wondering the the lock mechanism from a &quot;T&quot; rear hatch handle 
can be put into an early ('60) drivers side pull handle.

Here's why. My '59 currently has a no lock handle on the driver's 
side. I've got a handle with a place for a lock...but the actual lock 
mechanism is gone...leaving a hollw round hole more or less.

I've also got a &quot;t&quot; latch handle that used to be on the rear hatch. 
The it broke off and the previous owner put a new &quot;t&quot; handle on, 
leaving the broken one for me to throw in my stash pile.

So I was hoping to remove the round lock mechanism from the &quot;t&quot; 
handle and install it in the driver pull handle. Then a nice trip to 
the local mom &amp; pop locksmith to get keys made for the whole bunch of 
'em.

If the swap can be made, let me know the details of how to do it. I 
don't see anything about the &quot;t&quot; handle in my reprint of the bently.

Thanks in advance.
