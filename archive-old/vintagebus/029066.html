Subject: westy side door ?
References: &lt;200008061627.JAA85192_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi all - I just noticed something on my 67 westy and I'm not sure what
it is/was.

on the inside of the rearmost cargo side door, along the upper left side
edge there is a fold of metal with the remnants of some white canvas in
it. Any ideas? This is not on the other cargo door, just the one with
the shelf.

thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
