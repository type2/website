&lt;&lt; So now that the bezel is off, how do I put it back on and have it
 look virtually untouched??? &gt;&gt;
   I use a home made bezel tool, it's a screwdriver with the end rounded off.
The end looks like a the curved part of the letter U.  You can slowly roll the
edge of the bezel back around the housing.  You make have to go around 3 or 4
times to get it smooth.
  Peace, Love, and a piece of masking tape on the end of the tool stops
marring,
