Holding the choke open and pumping the gas I see little spurts of gas.  Not a
good
stream like I'm used to seeing.
Think maybe the cark could use some tender ministrations?  She'll fire up if I
pour
gas down Carb (fire extinguosher at the ready) but promply dies.  Carb's a
Pict 30.

sounds like the carb wants to be cleaned out.   Sometimes they'll keep running
if you keep pumping the gas, as the idle jet is clogged, but the accelerator
jet works.   Anyway, if it works when you  pour gas in it, it'll be the carb. 

..unless it's the fuel pump.    undo the gas line from the carb, and have
someone turn the key so the engine turns just a few seconds- does the gas
pumps out?  If so it's a carb problem, if it does, then it's the pump,....

unless the pump isn't getting gas.   You do have gas in the tank, right?
(sorry I know that's a dumb question but I've been there.)  Pull the line off
the pump where it comes from the tank-  gas should come out with gravity.  If
not, you have no gas or a clog in the line.   Sometimes those metal lines
clog.   

And sitting buses can get rusty grit in the gas tank.  It can use up fuel
filters and clog the fuel

Congrats on getting it going.  :)  The Ark will revive!
