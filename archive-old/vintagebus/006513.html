Subject: Compression, RPM's, and a trip...

Hey all,

I have just done some stuff to my '60 DC with a dual-port 1600 with
H30/30PICT Solex, stock exhaust and air cleaner, 009 distributor, probably
between 12K and 15K on the engine, which turns an early '67 tranny and
RGB's.  Rear tyres are 215/75 15's, fronts are 165/? 15's.  I have installed
(temporarily) a SunPro MiniTach (which I checked against my new digital
gauge from Actron), would like to report that my shifting tendencies are
between (max-acceleration) 3700 and 4000 from 1st to 2nd, 3500 to 3800 from
2nd to 3rd, and 3000 to 3500 from 3rd to 4th.  Repeat:  These are MAX, and
are made by driving like I normally do, and checking....as opposed to
changing my driving to accommodate the tach.  My preferred top cruising
speed, 60mph, tachs at 3500 rpm, while my &quot;other&quot; preferred cruising speed,
55 mph, comes in at 3000.  I guess these figures are OK...any comments?  I
am trying to abide by the 1500-3500 rpm rule of the thumb.

I checked my compression today after adjusting my valves.  My (new last
week) plugs are dry black around the edge, and the tips are light tan to
almost black (#2 is the darkest).  I suspect that I'm running rich. (Gee,
you don't say....really?).  The compression results are as follows:  Engine
cold:  #1=120,#2=125,#2=125,#4=125.  Engine hot:
#1=135,#2=140,#3=140,#4=140.  So what gives?  Maybe PO did not cc the heads?

Then I messed with those neat screws on the carburetor.  Don't know what the
hell I was doing...I was trying to figure out why my plugs are black, and
why I'm only averaging 20mpg.....any help on that?  Also, this carb has a
weird dual-adjustment idle speed screw...it sits on/adjusts a bent plate
with a rubber bubble/foot on the inside that keeps the main idle speed screw
from contacting the fast idle cam when the engine is hot.  I would love to
know how to properly set up this carb!

Dwell is around 43-47????  What the hell does that mean?

So the thing still makes funny noises upon startup/warmup.  I don't want to
hear noises like that, but then again, I'm a paranoid one.  I'll be heading
off into the snow country (Mt. Shasta) with Brian Piercy and crew this
coming up Friday, and I don't want to leave anything to chance.

Later,
