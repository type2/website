Hi Everyone,

    Just as they say, &quot;GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT. . .&quot; (long
enough, that is).  I just returned from tracking down a lead about a local
farmer who was said to have a &quot;big ol' pile of VW van crap&quot;.  Well, when I
got out to his house, we talked for a bit before he led me out to an old
pole-barn (like where they keep hay bails).

    He seemed hesitant to show me all the &quot;van crap&quot; at first, but after
talking about 15-20 minutes, I think he was reassured that I WAS a VW
fanatic (never mind the E-Z Camper I drove up in :-) ).  He mentioned that
all the &quot;junk&quot; was given to him years ago by a friend that used to convert
old VW vans into campers and these were some of his old &quot;obsolete junk&quot;.
His friend had recently died and now he didn't feel obligated to keep the
stuff around now.

    My jaw hit the floor when he pulled off the tarp that covered the huge
neatly organized parts pile.  In it were 16 PERFECT cab dividers, about 40
perfect original pop-outs w/ spoons and hinges, 4 complete sets of what I
believe to be original safari windows w/ latches and lots of extra
hardware(!) a huge pile of what look to be tent poles for the 12 striped
Sundial-style(?) tents(!!), 3 boxes of camper interior parts (latches,
hinges, and handles), 3(!) splitty era middle seats (2 Como green and 1
S&amp;P), several interiors worth of original panels (I'm assuming from
converting people's deluxes and such to wood interior campers) and a bunch
more small stuff that I haven't inventoried yet!!!!!  Oddly though, no rear
bumpers?!?!?! :-(  All items appear to be in good to perfect condition!!

    I asked him how much and he said, &quot;Is $250 a good price??&quot;  My hand was
trembling as I reached for my wallet and handed him 3 hundreds and said
&quot;Keep the change.&quot;  He was very happy with the extra money and even helped
me load it into the bus and on my roof rack!!!

    As you can imagine, I can't use most of this stuff, so once I get it all
sorted out and inventoried, I'll I let you all know what will be available.

    I think I can safely say that I've found my &quot;stash of a lifetime&quot; and I
can stop looking now (NEVER) :-)  They're out there folks!!  You just got to
keep looking!!
