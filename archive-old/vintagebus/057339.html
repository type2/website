Subject: Westy interior light shades

Hello all-

Does anyone know if the interior camper lights for a
westfalia (the rectangular ones) were repoped? I had
someone graciously offer to redo a few for me and he
thaought that after closer inspection the might be
repro's. The edges and bends were done by hand. Were
they originally? I have had this bus since 1993 so
they would have to be at least that old but they were
in pretty sad shape even when I got them.

Sean
65 Westfalia
