I leak tested mine and the &quot;geo metro truck rubber&quot; (As I call it) from 
Creative Engineering passed with flying colors.
Leaks MUCH less that the stock rubber. (Even NOS seals!)
Im getting ready to install some original safaris in my standard. Everything 
except glass and frame to glass seals are original. 
Im even using the original &quot;adjustment&quot; plates that fit in the body. 
Installing them as per suggested by the workshop manual.
Ill keep the list posted as far as how originals fit.
Off to the blaster and the chrome shop tomorrow.
Picking up the glass from BFY. Should be installed by the end of the month 
and ready for the sacramento BOR late May.

While I didn't have the problems Greg did, I did have issues getting 
everything
dialed in and fitting.  This consisted of such diverse elements as:
wacking on the dash at the tab to &quot;lower&quot; it, wacking on the area above the 
window frame to get the frame &quot;higher&quot; and griding off a small amount of the
bottom of the latch.  Now that they're in, they open and close with mild
effort, which is what you want - too easy means you don't have enough
pressure on the rubber.  Oddly, I haven't tried leak-testing them yet.
