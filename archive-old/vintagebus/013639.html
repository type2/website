I always buy real Bosch rebuilt generators, and included with
them are instructions on how to polarize it before use.  I'll bet
it somehow voids the warranty if you don't.  I bought one
last winter for the '55, and it had the polarizing isntructions.

Stay the heck away from the Chief/AutoZone/Kragen/etc starters,
generators, etc - they're C*R*A*P.  Spend the extra $30-$50 and
get the real deal.  I don't care about their &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; -
it sucks to have to change one of these things every year (I went
thru 6 of these cheap starters in the '56) and it's worth $50 to
me not to have to deal with a part that's essentially defective
the moment you pick it up off the parts counter.

&gt; I dont bother with polarizing anymore. And you shouldn't either. 
&gt; Why?
&gt; You should get a lifetime gen or alt whatever you need. They work or they go
&gt; back simple as that, spend the cash and it will be the last time you do. My
&gt; gen, starter, dist cap, has been following my busses for years. Look in the
&gt; archives, I must be there.
