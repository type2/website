Subject: Sand in Engine Compartment

&gt; From: Jeffrey.Carver_at_Aerojet_dot_com (CARVER, JEFFREY D)
&gt; Subject: Sand in Engine Compartment

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Today's topic is sand in the engine compartment.  The
&gt; PO had the bus sand blasted and didn't clean up well.

Don't blast the PO too much.  I sandblasted my engine
compartment more than five years ago in preparation for new
primer/paint.  I blew, vacuumed, shook, rattled and (not
quite) rolled to get the sand out.  Finally satisfied enough
to paint and reassemble, I've had the bus on the road for
four years and still find sand in the engine compartment.

The spot in front (FIF) of the battery has one or two drain
holes and the sand should fall out through them, though if
you don't blow away the sand at the top of the wheel well
(around the fuel filler), it will just fall back down next
to the battery the next time you shoot air anywhere in
there!
