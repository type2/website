Subject: sorry, more POR15 ?'s

hey,
i called to inquire and order some of these magic products and after talking 
to the operator am more confused than ever. i removed the front windows and 
discovered it was pretty crusty and pitted under there. found two or three 
tiny holes on the bottom. i was thinking of using some of the POR15 putty 
stuff to fill in the pits and holes and then top it with the black stuff. 
anyone ever use their putty? suggestions please.

i have the 6 side windows out too, WOW... NO RUST. i sanded them smooth and 
wanted to brush some around the frames for xtra rust protection, but the 
POR15 guy said you have to apply it to BARE metal. is it worth sanding all 
the way down to bare metal to apply the POR15 or should i just spray a few 
coats of el cheapo primer on them. (its made it 34 years without rust) 
anyone put this stuff over paint? does it stick? will it still protect? what 
about spraying it on the frames and underbody?
thanks for reading...
