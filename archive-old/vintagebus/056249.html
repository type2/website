Subject: Re: [VB] My wiper blades suck

I heard about this trick on TV or somewhere. When blades start to streak,
its usually due to a build-up of oil and dirt on the blade, it usually isn't
due to the blades wearing-out.

Put some lacquer thinner or fingernail polish on a rag and wipe the blade
edge with it. You should see a lot of crud come off and this usually stops
the blade from streaking. Of course, if the blade is cracked or otherwise
damaged, it is time to change blades.

&gt; This afternoon we got a preview of the afternoon thunderstorm season here
in
&gt; Florida.  My wiper blades (which I replaced 2 years ago with stock blades
at
&gt; $16/each - ouch!!) need to be replaced once again.
&gt; Any suggestions out there??  This is my daily driver and although
everything
&gt; is pretty much stock, I am more interested in something that works better
&gt; and improves overall safety.
