&lt;&lt;Since I saw the post from oldvws_at_yahoo I thought I would warn others from 
doing business with a Frank Leach &quot;Christy's vintage cars&quot; Ogden, Orem Utah.
The guy still owes me  big $ for Oct. 1998.
I think his name came up on early posts before I got back on the list.
He seems to be a rip off artist. 
Any others bitten by this A hole?
