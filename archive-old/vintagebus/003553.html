Hi All,

While at the vintage meet this past weekend in Seattle (I was there with the
yellow 58 ghia vert since the double cab is still on jack stands...)  I
realized that I am missing the little piece that is welded to the engine lid
that the support bolts to.  I have the support and correct bolt.

So, how can I reproduce this... or does anybody have a completely mangle
engine lid that they could cut it from.  Or could someone supply me with
dimensions and also where exactly to weld it to the lid.

Thanks

David
