Subject: Re: [VB] Safari's and the Man

 the only
&gt;requirement is it must have working windshield wipers...


actually, the law states that if it has NO windshield, it needs NO wipers.
they get ya now by requiring window stickers, they assume you need a
windshield, thus you need wipers; you can get around this by mounting the
needed stickers on a piece of plastic stuck on the dash.

hippies used to take the glass outta bugs when the wipers failed. least,
here in sunny texas!
