&gt;Hiya volks.

&gt;  I could use some help trying to figure this out. I'm after a bus for sale
&gt;that belongs to a friend's uncle, and it's supposedly a '64 or '65.
&gt;He sent me a
&gt;number which he says is the chassis' number, but it is not the same kind
&gt;as the ones on the chart. The number he sent me is 1173454. What is this
&gt;number ? Engine ? Or could it really be a chassis reference ? Thanks in
&gt;advance for any light on this subject.

Eduardo,

It is an early 1964 model, manufactured in October 1963.  NEATO has a site 
with chassis # &amp; engine # info at
