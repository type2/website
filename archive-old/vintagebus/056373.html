Subject: Rap on distributors

The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year? Is it
the case? Is it the number of ports? Is it the crank? What changes on the
1600 engine occurred over the years to require a different distributor???

History:

Thanks for the help at Everybus to everyone that had input on my hot engine
problem. The ride there was long as I could not go over 50 mph and keep the
oil temp (VDO dip stick sender) below 250 degrees. I radioed the carabussers
and told them to pass me, but my buddies from the TN Mechanized and my best
friend Chris Slaymaker refused to leave me.

One initial comment: If you ask 20 bus owners about oil temp reading, you
will get 20 different answers. I had one guy nervous about his high
temperature getting to 190 and one guy with worlds more VW experience than
me running at 280 and not concerned in the least.  My gut tells me to cool
off at 240, but I had just put in 20-50 synthetic so I figured I would not
go past 250 and stay safe.

I had retarded the timing a bit with no help and no power so I advanced the
timing just before the trip. I had much better power, and stayed at
comfortable temps in the mountains, but the Interstate driving nearly killed
me (literally as if that outraged redneck truck driver had had a gun, I
would have been shot for slowing him down- another story for another day).

Anyway, Steve Dolan putzed with the timing at EB and said it was too far
advanced, and anyway, that was the wrong distributor for that year. He
retarded it a bit but that did not help and did lead to a loss of power
coming back of the mountain.

I ask The Big Question because this engine is a bit of a Frankenstein as I
built it on the case from the 71 DP. The case was stamped &quot;Mexico&quot; so all I
know is that it was in the bus when I bought it in 1983. It was DP when I
tore it down, but I put on SP heads. The crank was also from the 71, but I
have no idea if it was the original one. So when I look at distributor
charts, what year engine do I have?

Dolan was right. I found out today that this distributor is from a 1972 MT
Beetle, and as confused as I am, I am sure I do not have one of those. :-)

I have four distributors in front of me and none look close to what I need.
Dolan and I went butt sniffing (engine lid lifting) at EB, and found all the
early bays that we looked at were running 009s. I have one of those but a
friend was messing with it and broke the return spring. We found a spring
that would fit, but I assume that it is important to put the exactly correct
one back in for it to advance correctly. How can I get this one fixed?

Thanks to all for any input.

PS: One good thing happened. Many listened to the engine and thought it
sounded great. I guess the vibration thing is not as bad a I perceived it to
be.
