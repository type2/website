Subject: Bus for sale in SAC

Here is the ad that was in the Bee.  &lt;&lt; BUS 1961, straight body, 1600 dp, 
dual carbs, new parts. Must see! $1500/ofr 916-395-2550&gt;&gt;


I went and looked at it in the rain today. It is in primer, has chrome motor 
with dual kardons, Berg shifter, but not lowered. Late model seats, cut dash 
with a replacement section, noticed some rust behind front passenger wheel. 
Kombi. Any other things you want to know you would have to call the owner. In 
my eyes, a fair deal.
