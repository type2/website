&gt; hey all
&gt; I picked up a perfect, non ripped-non bent childs cot today with brackets.
&gt; These aren't teh same brackets that I've seen on the 69 I had...and the
poles
&gt; in teh cot aren't the same either...they are much simpler..and are made
out of
&gt; galvanized steel i believe...
&gt; the cot is that mustard puke color...
&gt; I belive it is a splittie cot.

The bars are 3 sided? If yes: they are 69 and up. Will fit a 68, but almost
all 68's I've seen have been round and black, like split cot bars. But you
need to measure them. If they are:
55 1/4&quot; long and round, painted black. They are for splits.
56 1/4&quot; long and round, painted black. 68 bus [will fit up to 73]
56 1/4&quot; long and 3 sided. 69-73
57 1/4&quot; long and 3 sided. 74-75
2 piece collapsible, 3 sided. 76-79
