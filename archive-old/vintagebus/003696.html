Subject: Value of Full Luggage Rack??

Ok folks I have another value question.  I'm going up north to look at a VW
Bus Saturday that the owners says has a full length Luggage Rack on it.
He said it's not a Camper Bus but described a wooden floor, a closet, a fold
down table and a frig/sink unit.  Sure sounds like a Westy.  But he said the
top is solid.  OK my question; what does a full lenght rack bring?  I
thought if it would be worth trading for a 1/3 one and a set of Safari's. To
much to expect?

Dave
