i have 30 wt oil , the second one did not baloon, i looked at the oil
pressure springs today, but ididnt measure them , but yesterday when i
cranked it it took about 2 minutes before leaking, and after i turned it off
for 5 minutes and turned it back on it took about 30 seconds before it was
leaking, that should mean that the oil pressure valve is working , but how
long is it supposed to take before it sends oil to the cooler?
i also noticed after the first removal and instalation that the temperature
was very very low, after running for 15-20 minutes it was around 150 , where
as normally it would be 175ish ,

i just finished removing the engine again, the new oil cooler is dripping at
the bottom and you can see oil on the inside at the bottom and sides, and a
trail goin down the 3/4 tin , but it does not seem like its coming from the
adapter to cooler seals,

im off to the flaps to buy a new oil cooler and seals,

jb

&gt;
&gt; here is my situation,   i changed the oil in my 1600, dual port, doghouse
66
&gt;
&gt; bus the other day,   it is a new brazilian case, less than 7000 miles.  2
&gt;
&gt; days later it is leaking pretty bad , drip drip drip, i swear i only put
in
&gt;
&gt; a little over  2 quarts when i changed the oil.
&gt;
&gt; i jumped right on it the next day, pulled the engine in 26 minutes, took
off
&gt;
&gt; the shroud, and the oil cooler looked pregnant, i happened to have another
&gt;
&gt; one, brand new , both of them are brazilian oil coolers, so i put it on,
put
&gt;
&gt; it back together,reinstalled (3hours total time on gravel), and bam, it
&gt;
&gt; worse than before,
&gt;
&gt; now it is pouring out of the left side, so im thinking maybe the seals
arent
&gt; - - - - --  -
&gt; did the second one balloon?    What weight oil are you using?   what size
are
&gt; you oil pressur relief springs.  I am wondering if this is because of too
&gt; high oil pressure.  Never balooned a cooler myslef, but have heard of it
&gt; happeneing when someone stretching the oil rssure springs to make higher
&gt; pressure.  (oops, now its too much!!)   do you have a pressure guage you
&gt; could use?
