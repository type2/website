I helped my sister sell her VW Thing top and frame and she shipped it out to Michigan. I think this has come up before but she used Grey Hound bus
lines to ship this. It is a fairly large and heavy object and it only cost $40 and that was from WA state to Michigan. Thought this may help some
of you looking to buy/sell/trade parts over distance.
