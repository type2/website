&gt; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!) and

&gt; drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this
&gt; month. Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their
&gt; raingutter towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on
&gt; top. It makes fun out of driving.
