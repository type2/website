Subject: Re: [VB] correction

I'm in on it.

Personally, I prefer the vintage look, but I make drivability 
&quot;improvements&quot; like engine, tranny, etc.  Oh, and a CD player.  But
here's the deal, the folks pounding on others for lowering, etc: wouldn't
you rather see a lowered pink and green split parked at the store than a
H*nda or Ch*vy?  All the more power, especially if the bus was going away
forever.  Besides, most mods can be reversed easily, and if they can't,
it would probably take less work to &quot;restore&quot; the bus after the mods have
been done than it would from scratch.  So if non-vintage REALLY bothers
you, just consider that they're keeping it rust free until they sell it
to a vintage nazi.

Amen
