Subject: Re: [VB]gas heaters, but not J tubes

----- Original Message -----
&gt;  it just makes sense to keep the stock heater set up.  I don't see any
advantage to getting rid of it.
&gt;

I agree. If the stock system works, leave it in tact. I do, mostly because
if I do not have it hooked up, i'll have the gas heater fail on me, and i'll
freeze my butt off. As long as I have a 'backup' heater, it will keep
running without problems.  ;-)
