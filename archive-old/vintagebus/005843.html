    Well I have a problem and need some advice. I've been trying to get
my old side mirrors off my bus so I an install new ones. I've been using
penetrating oil for awhile now and things were going pretty well. Both
mirrors were starting to move more freely and
then.....................SNAP!

since the arms were turning, you will not have to drill, just chase them
 up and out with a drift, followed by a bolt at the last inch, or another bolt
from the top back down when you get the arm out, if you like the nut at the
bottom. stainless is nice... (confused yet ?)
