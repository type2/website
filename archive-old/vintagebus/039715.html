Bus Boys of Northern CA sells a lowered beam for Buses.  In order to balance 
the look they recommend, among others, the use of a 68 Type 1 transmission 
for its durability in conjunction with their rear suspension kit.  I believe 
a Type 3 trans from a 68 is the other but I would have to look that up.  
Anyway, I am not saying I intend lowering my 62 Deluxe but since we have a 
thread on the subject and I happen to have a 68 Type 1 tranny assembly I am 
curious on the Lists opinions, sans flames, on this.  My son and I have some 
interesting exchanges on advantages/disadvantages in doing this and I would 
love to hear from the rather extensive experience points on the List :-)
