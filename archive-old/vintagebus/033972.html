 My appeal to the list wisdom is how would I go about repairing the oval
 hole?  I hope I can get the partial bolts out of the two holes, but it is
 obvious that some repair will be necessary to the upper, rear bolt hole.
 Can this hole be drilled out and tapped for a larger hole, or is something
 more drastic necessary?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
We drill holes that have stripped out deeper and tap them for a 5/8&quot;-18 Grade
8 bolt.  Then drill out the bolt center and tap to the stock threads.  The
thread the bolt in place and mark where it is flush with the reduction gear
box.  Then remove bolt and saw most of the way through the 5/8&quot; bolt, reinsert
and break off the head.  Then grind flat with surface and drill a small hole
to one side to pin or tap and screw a stud to prevent the 5/8&quot; from
unscrewing.  We also buy and use a 50% longer stock threaded grade 8 bolts to
finish this off and in those holes that have not stripped yet we drill deeper
and tap so this longer than stock bolt can be used.  For bolt suppliers you
should let your fingers do the walking and ask questions, unless you happen to
be in our NW USA area then try Tacoma Screw Products.  Use 1/8&quot; colbalt drill
bits to start out any holes you need to do and use only High Speed Steel taps.
