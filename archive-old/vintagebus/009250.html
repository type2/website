I've used this stuff when I restored my '65 bug. I didn't thin it down any,
and it went on great.  I had sanded down the whole bug to bare metal, and
primed it with this.  Now the drawback. I brought it to the paint and body
guy after that to have the final coats of my color sprayed.  It took TWICE
as much paint as it should have because that primer is like a sponge. I took
like three coats of the basecoat to get it to even look right. I would say
avoid it unless you have extra base coat.

&gt; Has anyone had any luck using Rustoleums clean metal primer in a spray
gun?
&gt; If so, how much did you thin it down? The can only specifies using a
roller
&gt; or brush, and I thought it might be cheaper than buying thirty rattle cans
&gt; at once.
&gt;
&gt; I don't plan on using it over bare metal, I just want to build up the
&gt; surface a bit without spending a 100 clams on a gallon of the DuPont
stuff.
