Not that I'm waxing religious or anything, but it's downright sacriligious
to be opening my filler door and engine compartment with a screwdriver!
Anyone got a (preferably used, dented, worn...with vibe) L-style church key
for sale?

Santa?

In other news:  Bartholomew (why did I get a bus with a long name!?) is
kickin' along jes fine!  Thinking of things to do for him when I get the
time, but for now he's groovin' like he should...
