 Ok, this one has to be the least expensive! For starting spark plugs
without any danger of crossthreading: cut off a piece of old garden hose
just the size for holding the top of the plug while you insert it down thru
the sheetmetal and gently &quot;feel&quot; it start into the head (with a little
antiseize on the threads). I keep several lengths on the tool cart. Works
great.
