The piece is mostly blue with some red, white and green. I'll put some pics of it and the gas tank on www.vintagebus_dot_com in a few minutes. Finally got my cable hookup provisioned right after losing my T1 to City Hall politics. 

VWHoward, do you want this?

If the snap on tent piece is blue or green john  vwhoward_at_ctaz_dot_com could use
it on his DD. He has tents for both sides but just one of the skirts, you
could really make his month with that piece.
