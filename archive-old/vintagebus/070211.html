&gt; Hello all,  I am looking for wheel bearings for my allstate single
wheel. It is the same style that Ronnie has. Any info appreciated,
thanks. Sean

If the original bearings have numbers on them, take them to a good bearing
house and they should be able to match them.  Otherwise you'll need to
either measure the old bearings or measure the axle and wheel and have the
bearing experts match them from their book.
