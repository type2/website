So im trying to undercoat my bus with por-15 and I have a few questions.
Like factory undercoating - whoa - this stuff is on there, in fact probably
about 90% of it is intact.  How thoroughly does this stuff have to come off.
I tried a heat gun and paint scrapper and it works but not as fast as a
propane torch and a paint scrapper but it will take me forever to get this
stuff off 100%.  How thorough is adequate.  It would seem to me that
sandblasting would be easier but then I would have sand everywhere in the
seems etc.  and that would be a rust trap, as well I would have to treat the
blasted metal with a metal conditioner and rinse it etc.. so that the
benifit over  not sand blasting would be marginal. I have searched the
archives and found few mentions of the best method to do this.

TIA oh wonderful list
