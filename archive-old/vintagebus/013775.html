&gt; I don't have any experience with &quot;ALL METAL&quot;, but
&gt; have plenty with a couple
&gt; of similar products.
&gt; 
&gt; When I was building jigs and templates at Boeing
&gt; back in the '50s, we did
&gt; revisions and repairs using DEVCON &quot;Liquid Steel&quot;. 
&gt; This is a 2-part product
&gt; with a very high metal content.  We'd plug holes in
&gt; drill jigs with this
&gt; stuff, drill new holes in it after it cured, and
&gt; press in steel drill
&gt; bushings.  The bushings stayed tight and true in
&gt; production settings where
&gt; they were subjected to very high heat and torsional
&gt; stresses.
&gt; 
&gt; A similar product is &quot;MarineTex&quot;.  This is also a
&gt; 2-part product that is
&gt; used often to repair outboard engine crankcases,
&gt; etc., along with pump
&gt; casings, exhaust manifolds, etc.  It's extremely
&gt; tough and can be machined.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....

 I didnt mean to start a long thread on this....
just lookin for some volks whod done this before:) Not
lookin for some spaceage stuff, or something thats
gonna last for 100 years (the truck wont be around
that long) just the best way to fill in the holes I
reluctetly(sp?)drilled to pull a few dents out:)
 Used bondo on a Che*y MC when it was dechromed,
worked good for a few (4) years. then started
seperating from the body flex... that was my best
guess:)
 Think Ill get the wire welder out &amp; see what we can
do... the holes are no larger than the O on your
keyboard....
 Dont like the torch idea, but if the migger dont work
we'll try it:)
Trucks gotta be road worthy in 6 weeks.. we have 2 1/2
cords of wood to move from Waco to here... an hour &amp; a
half, one way... Ill drive it with the holes in it, if
it aint rainin:) 
The body work comes second... did anyone read the post
on &quot;tie rods, fuel guage, clutch adjust nut...&quot;
I need to make it go, not show.....yet:) 
 FWIW, Ive used JB weld in stripped out holes... after
it cured you could drill it &amp; tap it out. No JB or
bondo will be on my truck:)
Thanks Everyone,
