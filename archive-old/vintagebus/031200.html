Subject: resurection

As some of you may know, I have been off the list for some time due to
computer server problems. But I now thing they are resolved and,
coincidently, I am back into my bus project.

Just to update you, this is bus number 216 000 001, which for those of
you unfamiliar, means the first bus manufactured in 1966. It supposedely
was also in the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, but I have been unable to verify
this despite hippie murals on the side. But I didnt buy it for that.

So for the last few years it has been sitting. Yesterday,  I towed it
from its resting place and put it on a nice concrete pad. I then gave it
a good cleaning. It was literally covered from top to bottom in a green
fungus. It was a horrible sight, but it cleaned up real well. I also
vacuumed up a lot of mice dung and a snake had shed its skin inside
which had me proceeding very cautiously. He he.

I then jacked it up on both sides and put it on very sturdy wood blocks.
I removed the back bumper and the plate below the engine. I then cleaned
within the engine area. I will be pulling the engine and installing a
muffler or installing a spare engine that I have. Of course the spare is
a late model 12 volt, so I will have to make the changeover if I go this
route. This was my primary plan because I thought the engine in it was
original, but I believe t hat it is not. The serial number starts with
three O's, which I think refers to a factory replacement. Can anybody
verify this?

If it's not the original, I won't worry about grenading it.

Les

Boy, it's good to be back
