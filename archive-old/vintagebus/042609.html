&gt; A washer on the oil sending unit??  Hmmmm.  I always thought the bore of the

&gt; the unit down to the base...you'll crack the case.  How would a washer work if
&gt; you're not supposed to tighten the unit down???    That is if the hole really
&gt; is tapered.
yep,

thats how i thought it worked, the _only_ sender i've ever seen tigtened
down fully is a t3 sender, my 71 t3 engine had straight threads instead of
tapered.  It has no washer and doesn't leak..

peas,
