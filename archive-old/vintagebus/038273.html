Ah, Friday...

&quot;Jeff Carver&quot; &lt;jeffcarver_at_briefcase_dot_com&gt; wrote about his (very nice, 
judging from pictures) Ford crewcab, and our conscience for history:

&gt; Interesting in that the trucks in question are 
&gt; the same vintage as the VW busses we discuss.
&gt; It's just that zillions more Ford Trucks were made,
&gt; thus not as rare and people don't recognize the
&gt; history being lost as they get crushed.

Erm... forgive me for knowing nothing, German that I am, but just how 
many is &quot;zillions more&quot; at that?  I understand they kept changing... 
1.7 million Splitties were made, so how many trucks coould Ford have 
built in those few years they made your style of truck?

Back to the subject, a pal of mine does have two 21-window roof clips 
(whole roofs including skylight windows) with sunroofs, and will sell 
at least one of them.  Trouble is, he's in Germany too, and so are 
the roof clips.  Anyone?  ;-)

And lastly, no-one answered my question for approximate value of a 
'65 tranny, condition unknown presumed working.  $20?  $50?  $100?  
$200?  $500?  No idea.  Got a seller, got a buyer, missing a price.  
Ideas, anyone?  I'd really appreciate this.

Yours,
    Erik.
