To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone,
Is there any listees in the Sonora, Ca area that aren't going to the Classic 
this year.
I'll be in that area from Thursday through Sunday if anyone wants to get 
together for a beer or such.
I'll be driving my 15 window up from the Bay Area to spend a few relaxing 
days there while finishing up my vacation.

Hope everyone has a great trip to the OCTO show and the Classic, it'll be my 
first time missing it in the last 6 years......
