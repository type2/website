Hello list!

Kelli Jo and I rolled back into our home town on Saturday in our '65
Kombi/camper after a 90 day and 8013 mile road-trip. We went as far
south as Lazaro Cardenas and Playa Azul on the Pacific coast of Mexico,
and as far inland as Morelia and Guadalajara. We met lots of nice folks,
Mexican and US/Canadian, VW owners, wannabusers, and dont-wannabusers
too. Saw several nice splits, almost all owned by gringos, and lots and
lots of bays, air- and many many more water-cooled bay windows. In Baja
we saw quite a few broken-down Vanagons, and even a few that were
running. 

We broke down ourselves twice, although never terminally, and both times
were back on the autopista within a few minutes. Eugen the Green ran
beautifully. We have a ton of stories, and a trip report that would
crash half of your email servers, so as time permits I will be scanning
pictures and writing up the monster, and posting it to my web page. 

Special thanks need to go out to listees Kyle Tillman and Family in
Phoenix, Jim (Rusty van Bondo) Ellis-- also of Phoenix, Jim and Lisa
Arnott in Union, Oregon, and Rick and Susan Crandall in Drain, Oregon
for putting us up on the way home through the US. 

I have missed the list
