&gt;Hi everybody,
&gt;  I have been looking for a set of hoops for my 57 singlecab and none are
&gt;to be found

 The guy that Dawn reccomended me 2 years ago, stopped makin them and i got
his last set. Vintage warehouse was makin them but they updated their
website saying no longer doin it. I think your out of luck. havent heard any
new names pop up in the last year. Wish Dawn would make some to go with her
killer tilt canopys.


&gt;Would anybody know
&gt;how much $ they would cost if a set did show up.

got mine for 350. i think vintage warehouse wanted 400 something.

 &gt;Or what about fabricating
&gt;them, I have the truck parts book and the expanded view doesn't look like
&gt;there was alot to it.

there really isnt.  Ive heard ppl on the list attempt them but never heard
an update.
I will have pics of mine and dimensions on my site soon.

&gt;   Another question would be why can you get the hoops and canvas for 68
and
&gt;later trucks?


well they had a longer bed so someone is doing the longer wood and canvas
for that. Still, the hoops should be the same unless the bolt pattern is
different. Ask them for dimensions and ill compare it to mine to see if its
the same. If so, you can buy theirs and cut the wood down.  You have to cut
on the wood eventually anyway after it starts to sag so you can flip it over
and the curves at the end will match the hoop (if you want to keep a
straight topped canopy).
Whos makin the later ones by the way?
