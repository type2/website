I'm getting ready to pack and head for the big vw outing this weekend in
Colorado but I just wanted to drop a line to everyone that I read each and
every post about making mistakes and I not only was laughing but really put
at ease by the big confessional we had going on.  It was neat to hear about
the blunders we all commit on our dubs and the best part is that by
laughter, we remember these little tidbits and it helps to keep us from
doing them outselves (hopefully.)

Thanks for the laughter and I'll be thinking of you guys while I'm out at
the show.
