OK - how many people always have their belly pans on? I just spent over
an hour refitting the one that came with my 67 westy after replacing the
master cylinder. It obviously had not been on in a while and needed
thread chasing and a lot of re-bending and a slight modification for my
under dash mounted heater and 68+ master cylinder, but it is now on. So,
with a summer/fall only driven vehicle, is it really a plus?

I don't always have my belley pan on.   never managed to put one on ethe 
westy (3 years? i've had the bus)  And I took the one off the 61 in order to 
change the drag link just over a year ago, which again needs changing.   erk. 
     For some reason I took the one off the 53, and it is kicking around the 
garage.     Probably to grease stuff.    So what?  well it does keep crud off 
&gt;from around the pedal, and if you have rust holes, makes it less drafty.
