Subject: Any PNWers going to Sacramento this weekend

Hi All,

Will any body that lives in the Boise area or in Eastern Oregon/Washington
be going to the VW show in Sacramento this weekend????  I'm trying to get a
rear seat from Greg Noble... who will be there.  If you live in Boise, I can
get my uncle who lives in the area to get it from you... otherwise, if you
will be traveling along I84 through LaGrande OR, you can drop it off....
I'll try and figure out some way to make it worth your while.

If you live in the Portland area, I could possibly go over and get it...


TIA
David Mayes
(LaGrande OR)
