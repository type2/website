thanks for all the advice on getting a 63-67 type2 Bentley manual.  The 
cheapest I found was $56.04 from Calif. Import Parts, if you buy it on the 
web. Otherwise they charge $58.99.  They're at www.partsvw_dot_com.  In stock, 
ships tomorrow, I'm psyched.  Maybe I can get that steering box put in next 
week.
