Subject: Jerome?

I'm sure it sounds early, but the VW season will be in full swing before 
you know it.  At least for us midwesterners where the snow has just left us.
Is anyone interested in making a caravan to Jerome this year?  I plan on 
going as I hear its an absolute blast.  Its 2,000 miles to get there 
though and would be much nicer to drive with company.  Anyone up for 
it?  Maybe some of our Canadian brethren or some of the east coast 
guys?  Meet me in Oshkosh or along the way, doesn't matter to me.  It 
would be nice to get some of the guys from farther away there.  Maybe 
people from around here already go?  I don't know.  I'll most likely be 
driving the 62.   I'd like to take a few days and camp along the way, 
but it really doesn't matter to me.  I realize that some people's 
schedules may not permit this, so I'm willing to drive more than camp 
also.  We could even leave from Buses Nowhere Near The Arch if you like, 
if you plan on going that is.  Its the weekend before and on the way for 
me, so why not?  I already told work I'm taking off...
So whaddaya say?
