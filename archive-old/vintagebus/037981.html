my 61 came with them, and in hot weather I drive with them open.  Actually I 
took the drivers side out as I barely used it, and it leaked more from that 
side, but it has been so freaking hot (90 yesterday I believe) that I am 
going to put it back in, and take out that tempered windsheild on the drivers 
side, especially after the scary story the high roof guy wrote.    Anyway, 
Never been pulled over for having a safari open.  The bus was sold in the USA 
with them on it.  I think in So Cal. they must be legal.  The bus also has 
those thingys on the wiper shafts, so you can turn the wipers out of the way 
so you can open the windsheilds without removing the wipers.  and the rubber 
ducky in the middle that holds the wipers.  this way if it starts raining, 
you stop, close the windsheilds, move the wiper back onto the glass, and 
voila!!!!  wipers. On the freeway I use the special pieces of 1x2.  The PO 
told me that trick- you just have the window open and inch or two, and let 
the bottom of the frame rest on the wood which rest on the rubber seal.
&lt;&lt; 
 &gt; Hello all,
 &gt;
 &gt; I was wondering how many of you out there drive with your safari's open and
 &gt; have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the SoCal area and I asked 
a
 &gt; CHP officer the other day about it and he said that it was illegal to drive
 &gt; with them open and that if they saw me doing it, they'd ticket me.  So I 
was
 &gt; curious if anyone has ever recieved a ticket for an open safari.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks,
 &gt;
 &gt; Alex
