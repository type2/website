Well, I decided all you resto-phreaks were dead wrong about lowering being
evil so I slammed my Barndoor 2.5&quot; this weekend.

Okay, not really.  Just temporarily swapped rims/tires.  In typical Everett
fashion, I ordered new Bias ply tires and promptly ripped one of my existing
tires to shreds driving home that night.  Nothing like the sound of a blown
tire and tube at 50 mph followed by big fun in the emergency lane.  Since my
spare is smaller, I was SOL on continuing to run my huge 28&quot; bias plys.

So... I pulled the cheesy 15&quot; chrome rims off my Single Cab, which is slowly
being disassembled down to nothingness, and slapped the front tires on as-is
with 165 radials.  Took a trip down to the local used tire shop (&quot;Tire
Dawgs&quot; - love that name) for some 205/75/15s for the rear.  Dang, those 205s
are a tight fit!  Strangely, one side has only 1/4&quot; of clearance and the
other has 3/4&quot;?

Oh, by the way, don't bother trying to call used tire places looking for
automobile-sized bias ply tires, unless you enjoy being laughed at.

Later,
Everett Barnes
