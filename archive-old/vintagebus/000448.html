Subject: [VB] Friday topic Mutant bus sighting
Message-ID: &lt;0.8c36fa59.255d0ddb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone,
I know for some it's early for friday, but I figured this is an interesting 
topic for Friday's.
I was delivering something to a customer today and ended up taking a wrong 
turn into a really bad part of West Oakland. 32nd Street if any of you know 
where that is. I happened onto a mutant split screen kombi of unknown origin 
that had an old Renault (sp?) top half grafted onto the roof. The bus in 
general was pretty wasted, but the old European growth just didn't look 
right. But, you never know what grows on things in that part of Oakland. Too 
much LSD in the 60's I guess.
This an addition to my other sighting of the school bus with an early 23 
window beltline and up section grafted to its top.
Just curious what other genetic mutations everyone else has seen.
