  Last week, I became aware of the fact that Rosie didn't have quite the
poop that she usually has. I also detected some popping and farting coming
from her rear orifice. I replaced the cap and rotor (she has a Pertronix
Ignitor), with no change. Replaced the spark plugs, no change. Started
pulling the spark plug wires one by one while running. No loss of power when
I pulled #2 wire, but there was spark jumping the gap. Removed the jets from
the right side Weber. All were clear and clean. Haven't pulled the valve
cover yet, I fear a problem in there. Anyone have any suggestions?
