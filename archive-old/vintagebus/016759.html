Hi list,

My '61kombi leaks gas.
I went to the web for prices of fuel petcocks
the following were cut and pasted from a website

1956-61 Fuel Valve for  $60.00 
1962-79 Fuel Tank Feed Pipe Kit $5.00   

Can I substitute the latter for the former?
For $55.00 I can use a stick through the gas filler tube like always
my valve was stuck any ways, it's just now it leaks.
Until I get that hotshot biotech job, I'm on a budget.

mahalo

Ken
