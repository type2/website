Subject: Hoover Bit Update and DP 1600 engine tin question.....

Hi again,

Thanks all for the tips on the gas line. Took the engine out and found a
couple of loose tin screws plus the hoover bit was actually there, but no
foam seal strip.

Corrected that, replaced fuel line, and then found my JSC dual pak mufflers
(13,000 miles) have cracks/exhaust leaks on mufflers where the supporting
tabs to the header are. Wasn't there last year and suspect it has something
to do with welding exhaust flanges to replace the stock set up. Probably
less flex in the flanged connection causing the cracks. Will need to
re-weld...... and I know... just get a stock exhaust system .....

Putting the engine together tonight and &quot;blueprinting&quot; the sheet metal, I
noticed that bottom rear of the fan shroud does not completely cover the
upper cylinder tin on #3 close to the oil cooler and side of the rear engine
block. A bit of a gap ....

Is this because the way the shroud covers the oil cooler on a DP? Also, why
does the back tin on the engine not fit tightly to the rear of the case
around the flywheel? My immediate guess is that this is not important as
keeping the front engine tin tight to keep the exhaust heat out??

Comments anyone....
