I have another Seattle bus that I would very much
like someone to go take a look at for me.

This one is a '64 and again initial reports are that
there is a little rust, but I would like to get a non-owner's
opinion on the extent of the amount and locations.

If the opportunity presents itself, please let me know
and I'll forward details.

Thanks -

Jeff
