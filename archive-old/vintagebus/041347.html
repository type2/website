Hey Now!

    About a month ago I completely reworked my front brakes(pre63).  I put
in all new metal lines, bearings, flexlines, shoes, springs, and
cylinders(allRMM).Bled and adjusted the shoes and I was set to go.  Upon my 
first coupla test runs I found that it made a noise.  I'll try my best to
discribe it.

It could start any time(from just 10mph to 30 and up).  Unlike some
discriptions in the archive, this noise had a constant ring(humming,
zinging) to it.  It had no signs of changing tone or whatnot, just a
constant ring.  I had a feeling it was the brakes cause I've never heard
it prior.  So, I get up to speed(around 30) and this ring appears. To test
it out I stepped on the brakes and sure enough the noise stops!! So at
this time I've got the noise pinned down to a source.  Yet what causes
this, within the braking system?  My only to idea's were that it was 
A - shoes rubbing up against the drums.  The reason this would occur is
because the new springs are not doing their job!  I beleive Thom had this
problem with his daily and had to change springs.  Mine came from RMM, and
they came as a kit.  I reajusted the brakes once and it occured again! 
Any clues as if this could be it?

or 

B -  Wheel bearings, maybe?

any ideas to get my baby running cleaner?
