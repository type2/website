Subject: Gonna try a T4 on a budget.

I've been getting the urge to try a T4 engine in my bus and would like to
give it a shot.  I want to do it for a lot cheaper than my 1776 though so
that I can prove that you can get bigger and more reliable displacement for
less money via a T4.

Now if there is one thing I've learned via real world experience is that
when you have an engine in your bus, regardless of whether you have a stock
tranny or a flyer one, the one thing for certain is that your engine needs
to be a torque monger from the line.  The extra weight of the bus
necessitates that you bring the torque on right away.  Straying away from
this will net you a bus that is not enjoyable to drive.  If there has been
anything I've written on this list that is worth remembering above all else
it's this paragraph.

So here is my plan - take this 1.8L Porsche engine and have it cleaned and
machined for the 2L P/C's.  Then the next big expense is the crankshaft.  Oh
how I would love a CW crank but wait - stock cranks last 140,000 plus and
it's usually the heads that go before then.  Also, the T4 engine was
primarily a bus powerplant anyway so it's RPM's would also be low through
it's life.  So the benefit of a CW crank is really seen in RPM's over 4500
which my bus will not see (besides I hate wrapping out engines - I'm afraid
I'll blow them and have to do the friggin' work all over again.)  Besides
the fact that pushing a splitty down the road is easier than pushing a
heavier bay window bus.  So where does all this lead us?

Well in order to do the T4 to T1 conversion, one must come up with a set of
dual carbs or face going FI.  I have the 40IDF's but the carb of choice on
the 2L engines is usually the 44 or 48's.  But wait - what's this?  In the
Weber jetting guide, jetting is listed for 40IDF carbs that are used on a 2L
engine which is their maximum applicable use.  So if I use 40IDF's on a 2L
engine, chances are good that at around 4500RPMs, I'd be losing power
anyway.  Therefore, it's possible that I should be able to do the rebuild on
a budget.

The heads will cost some money to be redone but will be worth it.  If I
spend more time spec'ing parts instead of just shipping them off for new
ones, then chances are good this is a doable thing.

As a bonus note for reading this message, I talked to a contractor today at
work about the nice little 63 beetle that sits out at his farm.  It's faded
bad but he says it's in really good shape.  I really like 63 beetles -
especially Ragtops and I know that if I got this beetle, I'd want to convert
it to a ragtop eventually.  Anyway, I told him I'd be out once things dry up
(having a January thaw where everything is a nasty muddy mess) and he said,
&quot;Well tell ya what, when you come on out, just bring a trailer cause you're
gonna take it home.&quot;   The engine is still in it and it will run (so I'm
told.)  If I get it, I know I won't be able to sell it.  I kind of fell in
love with the little forlorn beetle.
