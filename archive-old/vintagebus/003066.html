 Thanks to all the listies who asked about the Binz. I sent out enough
pictures to go broke, need to get a web site . It was sold to a young couple
from New Hampshire and they are driving it back as I type. They left early
tuesday morning and should have 1 heck of a story by the time they get home.
I loaned them my copy of TTT from NEATO so if they get in trouble and need
help they will call a split friend. I told them the Binz would run perfectly
and I know it wont let us down. They have the money and plan on a full tear
down restoration.

 I have a Feb. 64 bus owners manual and it says to adjust the valves on the
optional 1500cc motor at .012 on both int. and exh. The 64 camper I have has
this motor, do I adjust the valves at .012 or the normal .006? Has anyone
ever ran the valves at .012?

  Can a late 3:88 freeway flier trans be put in a b/d? Will the b/d axles
fit in a later trans?
Will the nose cone and hockey stick work or will the front mount have to be
modified to fit later trans? I would like to run a stock 1600 and later
trans but keep reduction boxes. Is this imposible? Is the b/d trans the only
1 that will work with reduction boxes? I would like to have a b/d that sits
stock but can run freeway speeds on long trips.  Shoot me if you want, but
it will be another b/d on the road.
