Subject: Rechroming t/light assem.

   I just recieved a pair of 58-61 screw terminal T/L assemblies I had
resilvered. They weren't really resilvered but done in a process called
vacumn metalizing. This process is simular to powder painting, the
assemblies are put in a vacumn chamber and an electric charge is applied
which makes the chrome (silver) particals stick to the metal. This is the
same process used by the major auto makers for there headlight and tailight
assemblies. I had this done in Belguim and am looking for someone in the U S
that can do it. The T
/L assemblies look better then new now.

opinions on.
