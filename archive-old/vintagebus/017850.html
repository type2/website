I had the same thing on DARTHVW, and the PO put in new
lines a little over a year ago.  they were cloth braid
covered lines and had &quot;MADE IN GERMANY&quot; stamped along
the line in dfaded white ink.

A friend of mine and former 4-year FLAPS worker said
the only way to be sure that the fuel line is from
Germany is to look at the end of the hose (the cross
section when you cut it) there should be a white dot.
They put a white tread through the good stuff (for
I.D. I guess.) 

Has anyone else heard this?

He told me after I just got back with 7 feet of &quot;MADE
IN GERMANY&quot; (stamped in orange) cloth braid. I looked
at the cut end and - no white dot.

I'm thinking the shiny rubber hose (which looks like
there is a braid underneath the skin) might be better.

 Checking it
&gt; after replacement, I
&gt; found the rubber hose cracked and crazing and far
&gt; inside as I could see.
&gt; CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES, THIS WAS JUST A LITTLE OVER A
&gt; YEAR OLD!
