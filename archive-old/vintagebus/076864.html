Subject: RE: [VB] a little love from my tranny... 

Hi Oly,
First have someone try to drive the bus forward while you are under looking 
at the CVs and tranny.  Just make sure to lie under so as to be between the 
rear wheels and not in front of one of them!  Next pull the engine and check the 
tranny input shaft and the clutch disc.  If still no luck then drain tranny 
and check for metal bits as big or bigger than a head of a pin.  If gear oil is 
like metalic paint and chunks then newly rebuilt tranny time!!
