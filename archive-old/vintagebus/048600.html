I promised to follow up with the bus hoist story today, but I am having
trouble posting the pictures, I will get them posted along with a
discription.  I don't think I should make up any plans for the hoist as I
really don't want any liability attached to my wild hair ideas.  As with
anything, safety depends on the person building it and operating it.

This would be a good piece of equipment for a club to have, or anyone
restoring or rescuing a bus.  My next piece of equipment to build is to be
a portable rotisserie that I can put a bus on (using the portable hoist to
get it there) with or without the running gear and transport the bus to my
sand blaster.  The rotisserie will be as road worthy as a trailer with
lights, but will have running gear similar to a hay wagon.  Being able to
rotate a bus 360š will make the job of blasting, welding and painting the
underside and roof much easier.

As soon as I can get the pictures posted, I will let everyone know.  Thank you.
