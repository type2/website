Subject: [VB] elephant ears warning
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2000 10:34:44 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

well i bought some elephant ears, and i must say that these mirrors are kind
of junky, do all of the dealers carry the same ones or are thier better
quality ones available????

well 2 major complaints are that the mounts for the mirros on the inside of
the unit are made from styrophoam and will not last,  and second the seals
that go around them are not very tight, definate water catchers

but the big dissapointnment is that the $58 pair of mirrors, has crap
quality mirrors in them and the edges  on the back are flaking, especially
where the styrofoam touches the mirror, well as soon as i put them on i
noticed it, and in the last 2 weeks a feww more spots have developed and the
spots are growing. if i wanted black spots i wouldnt have paid $58 plus
shipping for them.

so of course i emailed the supplier 8 days after i recieved them, i noticed
later that day that they posted several messages to the list(advertising a
part which i had requested that they contact me as soon as they got it in,
and they didnt) , so they obviously were connected and sending and recieving
mail, but they did not reply, so 6 days later they replied with a copy of
thier 48 hour return policy(which obviously doesnt apply to the return of
emails!) and told me to take it up with the carrier, not to mention that
within the first 3 emails i send  to these guys there were requests for
quotes on parts that they ignored, it must be nice to not need the business
i guess.

well anyway so i emailed them back , very clearly stating that it was a
deffect, all i want is good replacement mirrors, or some kind of apology or
something, well so its been another 6 days with no reply, so i thought id
ask the list what you guys think of the situation?

should i post the name of the supplier?
am i at fault,?
isnt a 30 day window on part deffects expected at least ?
is it too much to expect a reply to an email within a day or two?


and of course if anybody buys these, check them out really well for flaking
the first day you get them, or you will be sorry and looking for replacement
mirrors.
