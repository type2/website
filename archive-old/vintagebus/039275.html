Subject: Cleaning Headlining &amp; other vinyl
Date: Fri, 10 Jul 1998 06:21:08 -0700

I found some vinyl cleaning information, but not the website,
though I know he has one.  Car Care Specialties Inc.
This guy (Larry Reynolds) does concourse level vehicle detailing.

For the full article of some text posted to a email group see:
http://www.corrado-club_dot_com/corrado/garage/detailing.html

Here's the relevant text concerning vinyl cleaning from the article:

&quot;Meguiar #39 - A very strong cleaner. This should be used carefully 
and very infrequently. It will clean just about anything out of vinyl. 
Must be followed by #40. A great cleaner for plastic Targa tops.&quot;

This guy tests car care products to determine if he will
sell them, not just an ad for Meguiar.

Email directly and receive a very well written catalog describing
not only the products, but the differences between them and some
information on when on may be better than another.  See the article
for an email address.

I plan on ordering a bunch of stuff soon.

As for painting, if it comes down to it, instead stain it, 
check with an auto upholstery shop.

On another subject, can anybody advise a good way to
clean up headlining? We've redone most of the interior
of the van; new curtains, cushions, panels and carpet
(see www.geocities_dot_com/~vwsplitty/photos.html ) but the
headlining is really stained and brown, although there
are no rips. I tried some Simoniz Vinyl Cleaner which
had no effect whatsoever. Is there a product that can
get this stuff a bit cleaner? The other option would be
to paint it with something fairly flexible - anybody
tried this option?
