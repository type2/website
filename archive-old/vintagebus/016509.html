Subject: 54' 23 window in vinatge issue of HVW
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA34610

In the latest &quot;vinatge&quot; issue of HVW's there is a red and brown 54' 23 window
that is featured on page 76' (article by RK Smith). The bus has just been
restored by West Coast Classics. The article mentioned that the bus was
orifinally &quot;found on the east coat in 1997&quot; by Mark Mertz. I know that mark
buys and sells lots of BD's but this particular bus picques my interest as I
*think* that this bus may be one that I found in my neck of the woods and that
mark later bought. Does anyone know the history of this particualr bus in
question??

Just curious.

Michael
