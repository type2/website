Please don't waste your hard-earned dollars on the &quot;new&quot; ones - they're
NOS alright, but they're brazilian late-model boxes.  They sorta-kinda
look like split boxes, but they're *very* different.  

I've had good luck with wolfgang (http://www.wolfgangint_dot_com) I had them
rebuild the locking column in my '60.   The current &quot;core&quot; policy is you
have to send your box to them before they'll send you a new one - I guess
they were having problems with people not returning cores.

&gt; is making a good rebuild these days. Has anyone put one in recently?  I saw
&gt; one online for for around 325-350 for a new one but if a good rebuild is
&gt; half the price I would buy that one as well.
