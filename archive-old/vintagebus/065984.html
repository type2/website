&gt; Not to belabor the issue too much but I noticed at our local Fred Meyer

Hi Bill,
The other problem is that the portable catalytic heaters you mention have no 
outside source of intake air or exhaust.  So they must use the inside oxygen 
you and your's breath.  Tents walls and ceilings are made of breathable 
fabric, VW buses themselfs are not, and popping up the top (If you have one!) 
vastly increases thermal loss.  Once enough oxygen inside your bus is used 
they stop exhausting cabon dioxide and start exuding even more dangerous 
carbon monoxide which like radiation the less exposure to it you get, the 
better!  Even non-vented catalytic heaters used in large RVs state that a 
oxygen alarm (Like a smoke alarm.) must be installed!  So unless you are 
happy to leave a window open in freezing cold temps it is a brain deadening 
proposition that works twice as well on small childern.
