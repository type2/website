&gt;&gt;One of the few cool bits on my site is a mechanism where you can leave
comments for any of the pix that are uploaded to the gallery, so you
can add info, ask questions, etc.  It was
getting polluted with all kinds of nasty flame wars and whatnot, so I've
implemented a close-loop&lt;&lt;

BRAVO! BRAVO Thom! This Peanut Gallery was actually very fun when you first
started it, mostly funny jibes kinda stuff, then it turned ugly fast! i have
to admit that I have not been back to look at this section in a very long time
because of the nastiness that was being spewed (and I'm kind of a nasty guy!)
So THANK YOU! 
A Vintagebus regular, John Baker
