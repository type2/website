Subject: Re: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

That sounds like an oil pump from an Auto-stinkshift bug. The cut off 
tubes are for the part of the pump that circulated the tranny fluid. 
It's probably OK to use, but I'd replace it at the next rebuild. It's 
probaby ancient.

&gt; I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is positioned a 9 o'clock and
&gt; another is at about 4 or 5 o'clock. Both have a steel tube attached that is cut-off and bent over to
&gt; seal it.
