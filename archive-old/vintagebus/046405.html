Subject: No Reverse...
Message-ID: &lt;c77c9341.2444b059_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I am new to the world of transporters. I bought a '66 Deluxe Sunroof with a
freshly rebuilt 1600sp in January and have had nothing but fun. Only problem
is I have no reverse. When I idle in neutral the bus wants to scoot forward
just a tad. When I put the stick to where reverse should be nothing happens
no noise, no grinding, nothing. I read somewhere that adjusting the shift
coupling forward or back can change which gears are favored. Could my problem
be as simple (I use the term simple loosely) to fix as adjusting the
coupling, or should I be looking for a new transmission? If this is an
adjustment fix, how would I go about it. What should I expect to pay for a
new transmission installed? Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Josh
