there are five buses where i live.  i live in a residential neighborhood.  the smallish house sits on a smaller than average lot.  the lot is about 2000 square feet.  yesterday another bus, the fifth, arrived.  all of the buses belong to people on the list except one but he reads the archives on a somewhat regular basis.  all but one of the buses is in the backyard.  all but one of the buses run.  there are two buses with shiny paint.  one bus is shiny but rusty.  one bus has bullet holes.  one buses has an impala taillight.  one bus has jacked up wiring.  one bus has a cushion covered with a material similar to gorilla hair.  one bus has a heavy-duty moose/bear guard front bumper.  there is a '67 sliding door sunroof deluxe, '62 double door panel, '61 flip seat westy, '56 single cab and a '54 panel.
