No Mr. Mink, the case was not junk. And it is not just
a lot of rhetoric. If you are going to jump all over a
subject, at least know the facts before you go in. As
for Mr. Kimball being a well known crook, I doubt that
the person who runs the largest VW show in North
America would get to his stature while being a &quot;well
known crook&quot;. But let's take John's word for it
anyway....

As for vintageveedub's complaint about Lloyds of
London (see below). He is right, Lloyds would not
refund his money, but not because I agreed to a
refund. Rather, the simple statement in the auction
listing of &quot;Ask all questions before bidding, and ALL
SALES FINAL&quot;. And I might add that the buyer even
attempted to set up an email account and pose as me,
in an effort to scam them out of a refund. So I guess
if I am a &quot;piss ant crook&quot;, that makes you a &quot;piss ant
schmuck&quot;....an illiterate one at that. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;well in my case of the 36hp case Lloyds (the
insurance co. for ebay) told me
that the seller stated he would refund so they would
not pay,   i told them
i had proof he would not refund and they did not care,
