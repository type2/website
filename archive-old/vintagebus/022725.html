I have the exact same thing.  Cost $8 to fill up, and lasts a month or so
of working in the garage a few nights a week.

They have a double-barreled version, which is what it sounds like you need!

&gt;I have a propane heater- the thing screws onto a refillable bottle- cost me 
&gt;$40 at Homedepot- and worth every penny.    I use it in the garage, and can 
&gt;carry it around, great for instant heat, and propane is cheap.  You can tote 
&gt;it outside and point it which way you want, warm your hands, dry your wet 
&gt;clothes, etc.   Just be careful, it does get hot don't burn your self or 
&gt;catch anything on fire.
