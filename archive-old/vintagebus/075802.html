Subject: Re: [VB] Panels for my panel

Tom,

I think that Wolfsburg West used to sell the panels in a raw state and
they were the same thickness and material as stock. I bought a set of door
and kick panels from them back in the 90s and coated them with POR. (still
waiting for someone to repro the proper thickness platinum vinyl covering
though).

&gt; this something I can get at Lowe's?
