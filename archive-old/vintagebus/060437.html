&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; My name is Joan and I'm a legal assistant at a law firm in Texas. I saw
this list and was wondering if Type 2 is a registered trademark with VW.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I don't know who the administrators are on this list but if Type 2
is a registered trademark, could they be held personally liable for starting
and or administering the list?
&gt;
&gt; My firm doesn't specialze in this area of expertise so I couln't ask
anyone here. Does anyone on the list have an answer to this?

We are fully aware of your confusion, Joan.
I believe you are looking for Type 2 Diabetes,
it's on another list. Good Luck.Hope you find it.
Dave /X\
