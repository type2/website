Subject: RE: [VB] Flip seat Westy/ M code help

Hi Ronnie,
I believe some of the flip seats had a code in the engine compartment?  I
haven't seen this to verify...I think Richard said something like that a
little while back, as thats the way it is on his.
My flip seat (61) has the code &quot;U23&quot; as the westy code...which you would
think is SO-23, but its actually SO-34 for some reason.  My friend just
picked up a junk flip seat that is less than a month older than mine (10,750
buses apart)...its westy code on the m-code tag is &quot;T23&quot; and it was also an
SO-34.  But...yours doesn't even have that code.  Perhaps it was sent to
Westfalia later on?  Was the m-code tag switched?  My tag is also screwed to
the seat base on the pass. side... just like my friends junk so-34.
My 61 also has m-code 382...like your 63...not sure what it means though.
Hope some of that rambling helped...

Isaiah

  I am in the process of purchasing this bus. There is no SO 34 on the
m-code plate. Where would this number be on a 1963 flip seat Westy?

here is a photo of the M code plate, it's screwed to the passenger seat
