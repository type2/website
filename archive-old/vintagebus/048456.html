Subject: WCM panel price?!

I was spending quality time leafing through the WCM catalog and
noticed replacement panels, though my wife would look more
approvingly (ok, less disapprovingly) on my '65 if I dressed it up
a bit -- the panel set is $950!! I was amazed! What makes it worth
that much money? Not that I'm going to be ordering it anytime
soon...
