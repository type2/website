Hey Chris,
	The real question is:  how original do you want your bus to be.
 I had to make a decision on the glass for my '61 Westphalia Camper. Do
I want to maintain large logo Sekurit glass all the way around or? I
choose to keep all the original style, always looking for better glass
of the same type at swapmeets, etc. Same thing with my '55 Single Cab.
Windshields where matching &quot;Delog&quot; stamped panels. There was no way I
was going to mess that up. They have a few scratches, but so what. I
would be interested to hear what you finally decide to do.
