&lt;&lt; I have an opportunity to buy a freshly rebuilt 40 hp for a few clams and I 
was wondering if it would work ok in a bus designed to run a 1500 ('66 Deluxe 
with 1.26 reduction boxes). Too underpowered for the gearing?&gt;&gt;
Hi Everret,
Well that not only depends on how you feel about the power Vs. weight of a 
bus, plus also what gearing is in the tranny.  Not only could that bus had 
wierd gearing from the factory, but who knows if it has been replaced or 
rebuilt since new.  We once had a tranny when we first got our 1960 panel 
camper that had great accelleration, but could not get above 45MPH pedal to 
the metal on the flats.  Turned out that it hit a engine speed of 3,000 RPM 
at 35MPH and 4,000 RPM at 45MPH.

&lt;&lt;Also, what is the deal with the rocker studs on those old 1200's. If I pull 
the valve covers off, what should I look for?&gt;&gt;
Round bosses means early 40HP instead of the later square ones with the short 
studs.  If you have the round bosses then you have to still figure out if the 
long studs have been replaced with short ones.
 
&lt;&lt;If it's too much for the bus, I'll probably put it to work in the oval. &gt;&gt;
Most likely it would be best for a unknown engine, and that way you can tow 
the bug home easily with your bus.   Eric&amp;Barb
