I think I know what you are asking Jamie. Your saying you would like
the pitman arm to align exactly on the splines as it did on the old
steering box? right? I cannot be sure, but I'm almost positive there
was something on the shaft and arm that helped me align them. Perhaps
it was a marking on the arm that matched up with the shaft. take a
good luck and see if there is something. It's been quite a while since
I had that thing off, I might simply be making this stuff up ;)
