&gt; one more question about gauges, what about digital vs. analog?

They both work.  The disadvantave to digital gauges is that you have to
interpret the numbers to determine whether a reading is out of the normal 
range, where an analog guage shows high or low graphically.

You can get digital guages with alarms that will go off if the readings go
out of the normal ranges.  These are great, as it is unlikely that you
will watch the guages all the time.
