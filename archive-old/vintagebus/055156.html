Subject: Re: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

If it were a kombi my 54 kombi would be side by side with that thing robbing
all its parts to complete the sunroof!

&gt;&gt;Is the sunroof Barndoor Kombi that's for sale on TheSamba as special as
&gt; the guy thinks? I over heard him talking about it at a show this past weekend.
&gt; He seems to think it's gold. Considering all it's missing is $4000 anything
&gt; but outrageous? or are pre 55  type 2's that much more valuable that post
&gt; 55?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; It's gold.  I'd like to own it but $4000 is too much for me, IMHO, based
&gt; on all the welding and repair work and expen$ive missing parts that it looks
&gt; like it needs.  Judging by his description and the photos, it looks MUCH
&gt; worse (to me) than the ad leads you to believe.  Of course, I haven't seen
&gt; it in person.
&gt;
&gt; It's a Standard, not a Kombi.  If it was a Kombi...  ;)
