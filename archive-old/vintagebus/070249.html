&gt; How can you tell when taking an engine apart(or from the referenced photo)
&gt; that the engine has been &quot;lugged&quot;(this means having it in fourth gear when
&gt; it should be in third, right?)

Hi Kevin,
Well if one RPMs the engine too high with a non-CW crankshaft this bends the 
crank a bit like a U which in turn shove the left and right halfs of the case 
there up and down (#1&amp;2 side down and 3&amp;4 side upwards).  Which in turn wears 
the #2 bearing halfs and the engine case halfs together till there is a worn 
space for loss of oil pressure.  Plus #2 bearing halfs end up somewhat 
pounded into the case.
  Lugging the engine or in other words running the RPMs too low in too high 
of gear and/or uphill/load conditions with either a CW or non-CW crankshaft 
instead of smoothly rotating the crankshaft is shoved/pounded sidways by each 
piston into all the bearings.  Especially bearings #1,&amp;2 get most of the 
violence.  This in turn shoves the bearings into the engine case halfs 
pounding into them.  Check out the look of #1 bearing i the images.  That 
raised line is an impression from the oil groove in the outside of #1 
bearing!
  The volks at Bear's VW machine in San Diego told us how a few years ago 
they went across the border to Mexico to see if there was a good source of 
rebuildable used engine cores.  After all the bug was still being produced 
there.  Turned out down there the natives tend to lug the engines to keep the 
MPG as far up as possible, but this resulted in engine cases in no condition 
to be properly rebuilt!
