Subject: Re: [VB] 009 with 30-3 Question Again!

&gt; &gt; My friend has a 1600cc with the 009 and 30pic3 combo
&gt; &gt; and needs to know the timing.

One problem with the 009's, is that the total advance usually varies from
one 009 to another.  Static time one 009 to 7.5 degrees, and you could end
up with 30 of total advance, but with another, you may only end up with 25
of totoal advance.

Best be with a 009 is to set the total advance to 28-30 degrees, and let it
fall where it wants at idle.  A lot of my 009's timed this way would fall
down to anywhere between 10 to 14 degrees.  If I static timed these, I would
have ended up with only 24 to 27 degrees of total advance, which will
actually make the engine run hotter.
