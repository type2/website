Hi, in my search for early Bus front bench seat springs, I began to wonder
when the seats of early Buses stopped using the &quot;big&quot; springs.  1958?
Anyone know?

Interestingly, my 1954 bottom bench piece is different than my 1955 bottom
piece.  The '55 has an additional 'winding' in the springs, which seems to
have resulted in a more hearty design, although still not hardy enough.  I
feel confident they are both original seats.

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
