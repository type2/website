Subject: Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

&gt; Thanks, Dave and Karl, for the advice on the oil filler sleeve nut. I was
&gt; just struggling unsuccessfully last night to remove mine, using various
&gt; improvised &quot;tools&quot; at hand. Even though the nut is on really tight, the oil
&gt; filler head is loose and rattles around a bit. I want to fix this since I'm
&gt; trying to get the above-tin half of my engine (and the engine compartment)
&gt; to be more oil-free, and I suspect some of the oil spray and dribble comes
&gt; from this area. My '67 bus has a '73 AH-series 1600DP engine. (Anyone have a
&gt; spare OG '71 bus air cleaner set-up, with the 2&quot; air pre-heat inlet?)

Richard,
Sounds like you have it figured on what is going on, but check the low
point of the breather tin and make sure that it doesn't have any pinholes
in it.  Water gets in there and rusts through on those dual port
breathers.
