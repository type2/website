&gt;From what I've found the power converters that come in RV's &amp; travel
&gt;trailers seem like they would fit the bill very nicely (i.e. battery
&gt;condition gauge, relays, panel access mounted).

RV power converters are nice.  They're also usually supported by a rather
massive set of batteries.  You can run one from the engine-start battery
in a Bus, but you won't get a lot of juice out of it before the battery
is so dead it won't start the engine.

A stock 12 V Bus battery is something like a group 42, which has a
reserve capacity of about 75 minutes for a 25-amp draw.  You can use
a bigger battery like a group 24, which has a 90 to 120 minute reserve
capacity, depending on model.  With a 100% efficient inverter, 25 amps
on the 12 V side gets you about 2.5 amps (about 300 W) on the 120 V side.
In reality, you'll get about 80% of that, or 2 amps / 250 W.  So, you
can run 250 W of stuff for two hours, tops, before the inverter will
cut out due to low battery voltage.  Then, your battery will be at
about 10.5 V and you'll have to figure out some way to charge it before
you start the engine.  Yes, this does scale, but it's not linear - you
get 250 W for two hours, 500 W for maybe 45 minutes, 1000 W for maybe
15-20 minutes, etc.  Going the other way is better - you might get 125 W
for 4.5 hours, 60 W for 9 hours, etc.

Running the inverter from a group 24 deep-cycle battery buys you maybe
20 minutes more run time.  Using a bigger deep-cycle battery is better;
you can get 3 hours out of a group 27 (13&quot;x7&quot;x10&quot;, 55 lbs) or 6+ hours
out of a group 4D (21&quot;x8&quot;x10&quot;, 119 lbs).  Installing a separate
deep-cycle battery also means that you can still start the Bus with
the engine-start battery, even if you've run the deep-cycle all the
way down with the inverter.  But to get the deep-cycle battery charged
back up in a reasonable time, you'll probably need the biggest
alternator you can lash onto the engine.  (A stock ~40 A 12 V alternator
would take about 5 hours to do nothing but charge up a dead group 4D
deep-cycle battery.  No juice left over for driving, etc.)

There's a lot more detail on this in an article in the Library:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/battbas.htm

For light-duty use, like running a laptop, a small TV, etc for an
hour or so, those $40 inverters from Wally World are hard to beat.

&gt;Anyone have any good sources for where old rv or travel trailers go?
&gt;or what happens to ones that are wrecked.

I've seen some lightly wrecked ones at places that sell new RVs, but
I got the impression these were going to be fixed instead of scrapped.
Punching &quot;rv salvage&quot; into Google gives several likely hits.  One is
in Arizona, one is in Indiana, and one is in southwest Missouri.
