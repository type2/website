Thanks to a fellow liste and some reasurch at Pomona today, i finally
know what interior trim i need.  I am looking for one 21-1/2&quot; and two
14&quot; interior front door trim pieces.  Can anyone help me locate these in
good shape.  Also looking for 2 aluminum coat hangers, a dash pod trim
ring and a clock with a clean bezzle.  Can anyone help?

Steve Harris and i went out to SOTO yesterday and Pomona today to search
for those ever elusive parts that we need.  He got a few things, but i
struck out.  SOTO was small.  We got there just before 8.  About 20-30
bus's total.  Not many parts.  There was a all origianal 64 Samba there
FS.  $6,500 and needed a total go thru.  I was hoping to find that
elusive middle 2/3 seat or a engine lid, but no.  We left SOTO preaty
quick as there was not much to see.

Pomona was big.  Lot's of people, parts and bus's.  Saw a few listee's
too.  Steve picked up some Westy gadgets.  He was surprised to find so
much Westy stuff there.  Me, nothing.  Cool things we saw were a 66
double slidder Samba, two 59 double door panel walk thru's.  An original
paint (teal green)/interior 64 crew cab ($6500).  All original single
cab.  64 bug w/ 32K original miles.  Stuff like that.  Lot's to see.
Lot's of parts too.  It was COLD though.

That all.  any help with the parts i need out there??

Thanks
Matthew
