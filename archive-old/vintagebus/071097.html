Subject: re: axle tube retainer woes

Jeff said:
If it's too tight, try ~adding~ gaskets to increase clearance...

Doh! You know, as soon as I read that I felt all stupid inside. It was too
obvious. But, that's what happens when you burn the midnight oil to get a
shell of a bus ready for a roadtrip in two weeks- you read manuals wrong, make
mistakes, and overlook the obvious. Thank God for this List.

i'm a little confused. you put the trans in before you
put the axle tubes on? that is the hard way of doing
it.

Of course it's the hard way! It's me we're talking about here! Oh... you don't
know me. Seriously- I took advantage of a second set of hands being here to
install the transmission. I knew it would make the retainer plate install
harder (actually, it's not that hard after you know what you're doing) but I'd
rather tackle that alone than the tranny job. The tubes were never detached, I
just removed the plates to por the tranny.

Thanks to each of you for your reply and for helping me to pry my head from my
rear.

&gt;I just installed my transmission last night and today I'm trying to
re-attach
&gt;the axle tube retainers. I started with three gaskets and worked down to one
&gt;of the thinnest, each time torquing the bolts to spec (14 ft/lbs. as per the
&gt;manual, in standard flange series). Each time it seems too tight. The axle
&gt;will not drop freely under it's own weight. in fact it won't budge at all,
&gt;even when I push on it.
