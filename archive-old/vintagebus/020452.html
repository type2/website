Subject: bus boat info
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have any information on the boat that was
built in the 60's (i think) that fitted to the roof? 
It's top edge was the same shape as the rain gutter of
a splitty.

Any info where abouts or pictures out there of one of
these?

Thanks
Matthew
