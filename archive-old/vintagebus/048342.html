&lt;&lt;I'd say its the hole for a gas heater if I were hazarding a guess.  Its on 
the same side the heater would have been installed on.

I don't see any evidence of any extra wiring.
No holes or mounting brackets where a gas heater would have been.
The original motor has the bracket behind the coil for the aircleaner (The 
fan shroud had been changed as some time, so I can't guarantee the 
originality of that).
Anyone gotphotos of the ducting setup? Were gas heaters VW installed or 
dealer installed?&gt;&gt;
