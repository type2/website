&lt;&lt; Also has anyone replaced the single type 2 master brake cylinder with a 
 &gt;larger dual circuit type 3 one? Or have any recommendations to upgrade 
 &gt;this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Trevor,
You might be better off checking out the Type 2 library for our conversion 
steps to install a 1972-79 dual MC in a 1950-67 bus!  Cost is about $50.00 
and we just ordered two of these and they came right in so stock of these MC 
seems to still be out there.   Eric&amp;Barb
