hey all-

i am shopping for some new german wheel cylinders and shoes for my 65 bus.

i have been quoted a price of $40 a pop US bucks for the wheel cylinder$ (p/n
211 611 069c and 211 611 070c which i assume are correct for my year)

soooooooo...... assuming that the p/n for the wheel cylibders for my bus year
are correct does $40 a pop seem priceY?? ($160 to do the whole front end i
figger i think they have two wheel cylinder ea/ on the front end)

any one know of a cheaper source for german wheel cylinders?? would prefer to
avoid brazillian schtuff..

michael
