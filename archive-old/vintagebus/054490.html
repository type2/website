&gt;I went to the local VW guru. Had brakes redone. Back brake piston came
&gt;out of wheel cylinder 3 days later when wife romped on brakes.

Pretty much I agree with the thought here that the only way for this
to happen was for the brakes to be misadjusted.  A weak or broken
return spring may have contributed, but I still think there is an
adjustment problem.

If the rear drums were turned, were oversized shoes installed?  You
can't usually get these at the FLAPS, but if you take your old brake
shoes to an industrial or big-truck brake and clutch shop, they can
reline them with slightly thicker than stock linings to compensate
for the drums being turned.  VW even recommended this: &quot;Brake shoes
for reconditioned drums should be fitted with oversize linings as
these linings are ground to match the turned out drum.&quot; (Bentley
p. B-8 1).
 
&gt;What do you think of the Torqing? Why is it needed?

Here's what I think:

# Up to Chassis No. 1 144 302  30 m kg (215 ft. lbs.)
#  From Chassis No. 1 144 303  30-35 m kg (215-250 ft. lbs.)
#
# Important
#
# If the cotter pin holes do not align within this range on vehicles
# from Chassis No. 1 144 303, another nut should be fitted.  The
# specified torque must not be exceeded under any circumstances.  Even
# turning the nut further the smallest amount causes an excessive
# increase in torque which can damage the bearings.
#
# from &quot;Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual : 1963-1967 Type 2&quot;

If you have the nut torqued to the proper value as above, put a new
cotter pin in it, and bend the ends of the cotter pin over to secure
the pin, then the nut is not going anywhere.
