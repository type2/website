Subject: rear safari/exhaust sucking

Thom wrote &quot;The downside is, you suck in exhaust when you drive.&quot;
This would make sense on a bus but has anyone tried it on a Double Cab or
Single Cab. It seems you would be far enough away from the exhaust to not
be an issue? I love the idea of more ventilation but only if it can
actually be used.
Thanks in advance,
