okay first we have a 66 standard with a 1500 singleport converted to
12v.  we recently replaced the clutch, pressure plate and flywheel.  we
are completely stuck as to how to exactly measure the endplay.  we
bought the tool, and feeler gauges.  we're just not sure how much play
there should be. how much is too much? how much force should be applied
to the flywheel and front pulley to get the correct amount of endplay?
we found the muir book a little confusing on this subject.  any
suggestions and must-do while the engines out would be greatly
appreciated....Ehi and Ruby
