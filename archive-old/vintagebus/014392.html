&gt; Hello Charlie,
&gt; 
&gt; Always good to hear from you, good friend... Glad to hear that you
&gt; got
&gt; your problem fixed quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't carry a spare dizzy (I have one, but it is in a former
&gt; girlfriend's bus right now), but I do carry a spare set of points. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the benefit of the list, if you have to pull your dizzy out to
&gt; put
&gt; in a new set of points, don't take the 10mm nut loose from the dizzy
&gt; clamp to get it out. Instead, undo the 13mm nut that holds the clamp
&gt; ,
&gt; pull the dizzy and clamp out at the same time. After you have changed
&gt; the points and reinstalled the dizzy, it will be in the same place it
&gt; was before you pulled it out. It may still be necessary to adjust the
&gt; timing after that (timing will probably be a little advanced), but
&gt; you
&gt; will be close enough to get the bus started, with no guesswork...

There is also a &quot;non-official&quot; way of static-timing that I've never
seen mentioned.  Only tools required are a 10mm wrench and a big wrench
for the generator or crank nut.  You also need a quiet place to work,
so shut off the stereo for now.

Let's say that  you want to static time the engine to 7.5 degrees BTDC,
(for an 009 distributor).  Turn the ignition switch on, rotate the
engine clockwise and listen carefully.  You'll hear a soft, but
definite &quot;click&quot; when the points open.  Note where the mark is when you
hear the click.  Turn the engine 1 full turn clockwise and listen for
the click again.  If this click is more advanced (or the same) as the
previous one, the crank is in the correct position.  If it's more
retarded, then rotate the engine another turn clockwise and you'll be
where you want to be.

Now you can time the engine by turning the distributor.  Check the new
setting by turning the engine counterclockwise past the timing marks,
then clockwise until you hear the click.  When the click occurs right
on the desired mark, tighten the distributor clamp and be happy!

OTOH, I've never been able to set points with a feeler gauge and have
the dwell (which is what is important here!) be in the correct range. 
I do set the points using a feeler gauge, but invariably have to reset
the points with a dwell meter (a minor hassle) to get the dwell right. 
This _must_ be done before setting the timing, as the points setting
affects the timing.  Too bad that Bosch couldn't have followed Delco's
lead and made the points adjustable by turning a screw, rather than the
silly pry-the-points-around approach.

More good news:  Check the dwell setting after driving a hundred miles
or so.  You might have to reset the dwell now that the rubbing block is
worn in.  Then you get to set the timing again, which, you see, is why
I figured out an easy way to set the timing. :)

Some folks say that all this is a hassle, but I find that the point
ignition is very trouble-free and reliable.  I carry a spare
distributor and coil, but have not had occasion to use them on my own
vehicle.
