 close to the tab.  There were two sets of the asymmetric units as well but
 they had the opposing hold down screws. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
Here in USA the headlights went from non-sealed beam headlights to sealed 
beam headlights in 1955 model year.  Both have the adjusting screws on either 
side, but the one used here up to early 1964 model year was a sealed beam 
assembly which could be turned from asymmetric to symmetric by just changing 
the sealed beam bulb.  It does look (From our parts manual.) that the 
non-sealed beam headlight for Europe was issued for Chassi # 614 465 on was 
an asymmetric with the adjusting screws 180 degrees apart on the chrome ring.

PS  Symmetric has an even oval beam of light projected by the lens of the 
sealed beam bulb or in the case of the non-sealed bulb by the fluted glass 
headlight cover/lens.           
     Asymmetric is what was legally required in USA for the 1956 model year 
on.  The asymmetric sealed beam bulb projects a beam of light that is more of 
a wedge shape that for LHD cars the thin end of the wedge on the side of the 
oncoming traffic and the (taller) wider end of the wedge on the ditch side.  
This produces less light being projected in the eyes of oncoming traffic and 
lights up more of the darker ditchside.  This means for the asymmetric 
headlights there are sealed bulbs and non-sealed lenses for RHD and LHD 
traffic countries.   Eric&amp;Barb
