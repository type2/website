Howdy Volks,

I wasn't even looking for it... and found it. Of course, Japanse thrown in
too, but hey... even a graphic to go along:

BTW -- I wanted to do a plug for of all things &quot;AOL Instant Messenger&quot; -- I
have found this to be a great chat tool, if you install it on your PC it
will tell others when you are on-line and if you are active on the PC.  This
makes getting chat sessions together much easier.   it is actually a pretty
decent program... Free: only a tiny postage-size advertisement in it.  YOU
DO NOT need to be an AOL subscriber...

My screen name is &quot;Type2Fool&quot; -- chat sometime!  You can download it from
http://www.aol_dot_com/aim/
