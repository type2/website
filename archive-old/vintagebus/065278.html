Subject: Re: [VB] Mirror bracket?

I'm afraid the VW models won't fit.
I think I'll be buying a replacement for the whole thing.

Be sure of what you're ordering.
There are mirrors with a ball mount on the stem.
There are mirrors with a bullet looking mount and a set screw.
Measure your old hinge pin stem and get the right size.
I had to buy brass tubing and use it as a sleeve in the hinge to get my
mirrors to work on my 66.
I'm supposing that it equates to OEM design and After Market designs.
