Subject: which shift lock?

i've been looking around for an original shift lock for my 64 bus and came
up with a few different brands, wondering if anyone has any knowledge of or
experience with any of them.
1-waso. looks ok, but with the angle of the key seems like it could be a bit
more of a pain to use in the bus.
2- vw. it looks like the new generic shift locks that are sold but with a vw
emblem cast in it. i've heard the reproductions of these are easy to to get
around and wondered if the same my be true of the original. also wondering
when these where made.
3- sperrwolf. it's by far the nicest looking, but it's also the most
illusive, the only one i could find for sale had already been sold. if you
have one please p-mail me.

i've heard some of them have fasteners you break the head off during the
install to prevent removal in a theft, i'd like to avoid those if anyone
knows which they are.

thanks
ronnie
