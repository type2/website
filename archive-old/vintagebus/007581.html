&gt;How much are rides??

This is something I've often thought of doing.  Go to an event where people
have to walk quite a ways from the parking area to the event.  Cruise around
in your bus or bug with a sign that says, &quot;Rides $1.00 ea.&quot;  Might not make
a killing at it but you'd meet a lot of people and see a lot of smiling
faces. :-)
