Subject: Bouncing Bus

Also check that your springplate bushings are in good shape. Stiffer shocks
will help, but you should be able to run normal oil filled shocks without
&quot;the bounce&quot;. Stock rubber would be sufficient, but if you go with urethane,
make sure you use the supplied lube to make sure they don't squeak.
