I was gonna hang on to it but I gotta sell it get some money back.

I've got the original complete snout and air cleaner assembly from a 1966
bus for sale.  The only thing missing that I can tell is the bolt that holds
the clamp down around the carb and the 2 bolts that go thru the snout flange
at the top of the engine bay.  This thing is really dirty and I'm ready to
sell and ship quick so I'll simply drain the oil as best as I can out of the
air cleaner and then use newspaper or sawdust to soak it up with.  You'll
need to clean it up.

To get approx. shipping info to your locale, you can go to www.ups_dot_com and
the origin zip is 68310. (Beatrice, NE)

I'm asking $40?obo.  Out of courtesy, please only express interest if you
have the money when you make me an offer.  If I get a good offer by Monday,
I'll ship it out then.  Thanks.
