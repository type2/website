&gt;isn't that for toasting toast on?
&gt;clara
Dunno - did westies come w/ toasters?

This was pulled from a westy parts pile, ie, a big box of stuff that had
come outta 3 or 5 vans, all different years.
Its about 41/2&quot; tall, has a small hole drilled near the tip of one of the
prongs. No part #, nuthin.
I always assumed it was some kinda closet coat hook; heck, it could be
sumpin to clean your golf cleats :P
