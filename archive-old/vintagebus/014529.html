&lt;&lt; I can't for the life of me figure out what is supposed to be different

 a bus heat exchanger and a bug one (fresh air)!  I'm at a bone yard with my
 old one and I see that he has a bunch of used ones - but they all look the
 same!   &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
The large snout (Outlet) fresh air heater boxes for 1964-67 bus are the same 
as 1964 -79 bug heater boxes.  In 1968-71 bus the place that the heater cable 
hooked to the the heater box valve to turn on and off the heat was moved 
farther upwards by removing the earlier lower linkage.  These later bus 
heater boxes will only work if you wire the valves open to get heat all the 
time.  So take a look at your 71 bug heater boxes.  Especially the heater 
valve linkage and then go hunting.  Best to carry a new rear exhaust seal 
(The dounut shaped seal!) to see if any of the heater box rear tubes are a 
snug or close to snug fit.  The snugger the better which will mean less 
chance of exhaust leakage and carbon monoxide poisoning for you and your 
passengers.   Eric&amp;Barb
