Subject: Minneapolis VW event this Sunday

West Side VW will host the annual VW show and swap meet on Sunday, June 11,
2000.  West Side VW is located just off HWY 100 in Saint Louis Park, MN
(about five miles west of downtown Minneapolis.

This is where I saw a local guy, 'Karmann Jack', and his VW rotisserie, a
couple of years ago.
