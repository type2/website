Subject: RE: [VB] 6V starter bushing in 12V transmission

Actually I was trying to save some $$.  I still have the 6V starter (with
new 12V solenoid) that worked great with the old engine.  Looks like I will
have to bite the bullet and find one somewhere.

I appreciate the help,

Thomas

yes, there is a mismatch in the number of the teeth. is your car 6 or 12 v,
and what are you trying to gain by using a 6v starter?
