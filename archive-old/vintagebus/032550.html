Subject: Re: [VB] How much oil?

i am very confused by this.  in every vw official publication i've checked,
it says &quot;fill the engine with 5.3 pints&quot; oil. is this not 2.8 quarts???? (2
pints in a quart. 2 goes into 5.8 2.5 times, with a remainder of .3 pints,
thus making it 2.8) or are my elementary mathematical elemnts out of whack?
i've been putting 2.8 quarts (leaving enough left to change the oil in my
oil bath air cleaner!) in my engines for 15 years, should i change to the
lesser quantity? will this make my busses lighter and help me go faster? 
no, seriously, it's 2.8 QUARTS for stock applications.  2.5 is how many
LITERS it takes to fill. or 4.4 imperial pints, whatever THOSE are! (lol)

&gt; The engine holds 2.5 quarts.
