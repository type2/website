Subject: Vegas Bor-a-Rama report

Well Vegas has come and gone, nobody really missed anything real exciting,
unless you like drag cars and a lot of noise. The Facility was awesome
though and the show does show a lot of promise. Trophies were the typical
Bor-a-Rama generic placks that people who enter shows and win have tons of
(at least the bus shows have unique trophies), VW Howard got to add another
to his collection with his DD Camper, maybe 20 Buses in all were there with
half customs and the others drivers, VW Howards was the only one in the
stock class with a nice paint job, bit there were some real nice looking
customs, my favorite was a primmered bus with RED plexiglass windows all
around and the flamed pressed bumper low rider, 1 barndoor was there (Shawn
drove his 53 up from Phoenix) at least he drives his and a couple of buses
from Utah, an absolutely beautiful SILVER single cab was there and you could
tell 100's of hours went into the bodywork, about 15 swappers in all with no
great or even fair finds as I was the only person with bus stuff, but the
weather was great and fun was had by most, but I'd rather have been at Buses
and Ballons, a real bus show by real bus people, thank goodness for Jerome
and BBB V, another real bus show will be here before we know it.

ps, we are accepting donations for the BBB V raffle and auction, proceeds to
benefit Abused Childrens home. Last year we raised $2300.00 for the kids,
this year we want to do more, remember it can't be done without everyones
help.
