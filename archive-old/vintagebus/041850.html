&gt; I did have someone open the door to

&gt; exclamation that can't be included verbatim in this
&gt; post and immediately retreated. The invader was
&gt; supposedly vaguely associated with an acquaintance.

sounds to me that you narrowly avoided having everything removable in and
around your bus stolen.  It's a pretty common scam for thieves to barge
in pretending to be drunk.  If the house/vehicle is occupied, then they
beat a hasty retreat.  If not, they fill up a pillowcase with the contents
of your medicine chest and jewelry box.

 &gt; Bottom line is that tight
security
and self-control &gt; are  good things. Thieves should be publicly mutilated
&gt; right after the engine blow and bikini contests.

In Pomona?  Don't hold your breath!
