Subject: RE: [VB] re:oil temp gauge

For those running external coolers with the adapter plate coming off the
original oil cooler location and an oil temp regulator valve, that is the best
place to put an oil temp sensor. That's what I run on my trike, max temp set
at 200 degrees.

Subject: [VB] re:oil temp gauge


I have not installed one yet, but I believe I have read that the oil
pressure relief is not a good spot, as this is kind of a dead spot for the
oil, ie not a lot of oil moving over this spot...I think when I looked into
this before there was some disagreement as to whether an oil pressure gauge
may be more beneficial compared to a temp gauge. If you search the archives
you can probably find the reasoning others used.
