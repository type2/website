Subject: Re: [VB] Yet another post on tires

&gt;I had fun with this one the last time I was buying tires.  Every tire
&gt;that came up on the computer was was a &quot;great tire&quot;&quot; - so the next time
&gt;he said it, I asked &quot;So have you ever runt hose on one of your cars?&quot;
&gt;Um, no.  &quot;Have you ever seen one of those tires?&quot;  Um, no.  Have
&gt;you personally actually ever sold one?    Um, no...


You mean to tell me that they can't lie as well as stereo salesmen?  How
many time have you heard from those bastards:  &quot;I have this same setup at
home&quot;  or &quot;I have a set of these speakers, and they sound great in my
living room&quot;

Yeah, right.
