Also, what's a fair price for a Gas Heater from the same 70 Bus?  Did'y ask

him about that.  So I'll make an offer when I go back.

make sure you take all the cables to the switch in front, the duct work, and 
the exhaust pieces, as well as the actual heater.  Often if you find a gas 
heater as a swap, it is just the heater, not the whole set up.
