Paul: you are looking at a relatively simple relay
which you must aquire and install. essentially,
you need to supply a large gauge power wire
from the source  to the component, activated 
through your original switch. 
in this circumstance, the origin is the battery +
(same electrical location as the alternator
output) (B + ). the relay ( an electromagnetic switch )
is activated by your original headlight switch, 
configured to &quot;pass along&quot; the power from the
new bigger wire directly to the headlight.
there are two functions being accomplished
here. the original switch only has to pass
enough current to activate the relay, which
reduces the load it originally had to support
(2 headlights). the switched portion of the
relay becomes the path for the load.
if you are confused over the terminal #'s,
please p-mail....Dave...
