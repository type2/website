Subject: re; the great truck bumper mystery solved?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

now that we know there were ribbed truck bumpers
vwhoward has 1 on his 58 BINZ, what years were they made, are there slash and pointed truck bumpers, or only ribbed, kyle said there is a slash truck bumper ( i have never seen one)and i have also never seen a pointed one, so has the mystery really been solved or only part of it?
so were they made for all years or for partial years to 55 from 56-58, 59-6?, 6?to 67 who really knows?
