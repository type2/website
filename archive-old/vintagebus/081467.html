Subject: Re: [T2] Have to disable a bus

Ok guys. I do this every year on April 1st. I have been doing it for many
many years and this time I even still got a few old timers. :-) The Newbies
are the best and have had some really nasty things written to me. :-)

Now, make a mental note to yourself. If you read it and understand what is
going on next year, you are officially an veteran BUS listee. Keep it to
yourself. A p-mail is nice ( thanks Jason, MUD, Greg Potts) but announcing
that it is a joke to the group takes all the fun out of it.

Grin and keep it to yourself. I am on digest so I don't get some of the
replies until the next day.

My personal best was the bus burning. Man did that get some people going.
