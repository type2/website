&gt; From the manuals, I concluded that
&gt; the big round metal assembly plug on the inner side of the
RGB might be
&gt; leaking, so I tore into everything, and that appears to be
the case. I don't
&gt; want to get deeply into playing with the metal plug, so my
plan is to clean
&gt; the area well and cover the plug (and a bit beyond its
diameter) with some
&gt; RTV silicone gasket-maker and rebolt the box to the spring
plate, hopefully
&gt; sealing it.
&gt;
For an emergency repair I've had success with making a paper
gasket between rgb and spring plate.
