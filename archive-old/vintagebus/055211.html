Subject: Re: [VB] Sherwin Williams Paint/Primer

Hi,

Sherwin Williams makes many common brands - like Krylon.

They have an online store.

&lt;http://www.sherwin-automotive_dot_com/products/&gt;

Did you know you can buy PPG paint online as well?

&gt; I am about to go pick up some acrylic primer from Sherwin Williams, but
&gt; since this is not gonna be cheap, I would really appreciate any:  &quot;Hey 
&gt; don't
&gt; use that stuff&quot;, and any reasons.  I haven't seen any PPG dealers in the
&gt; area, and this would be my first choice.  The price is somewhere around
&gt; $188.00 for a gallon of this stuff.  This price includes 
&gt; hardener/reducer.
