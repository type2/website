That's not NOS, just new. I sell the same lens for 8.00 dollars a piece.
I did sell a pair of NOS dome lights with the VW logo'ed lens for 75.00
dollars a piece, they are now in a 23 window deluxe that was RESTORED useing
nothing but NOS parts, including interior, this bus has more money in it
then the market would reach in 20 years, but then again it isn't and won't
be for sale till the owner dies.

$75...NOS or not, Ouch!
