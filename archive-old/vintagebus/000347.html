I would like to find a source for a European 4 ring binder so I can put my 
loose tech bulletins and other vintage info in to protect it.  I have not 
been able to find any locally.  It seems that the paper size is 11 3/4 inches 
by 8 1/4 inches.
I have several shop manuals and a special tools for local manufacturer book 
from the 50's that use the same paper size.  My question is this euro only? 
Or did VW use it exclusively during the 50's.  

Any help would be appreciated.
