Subject: RE: [VB] Thermostats...

I have several on my shelf that are broken and closed. I squirt them
with paint so I don't attempt to use them for anything else other than
setting up the thermostat bracket. The expanded ones I have I was real
lucky with, they expanded and stayed captive in the bracket and the
flaps were forced to stay open.

	the defective thermostats I've seen have failed in the open
position, which would keep the flaps pushed open.

	I clean them, then test them before installing them (drop in pan
of hot water, see if they expand, then contract when pulled out of the
hot water)   All the bad ones I found seemed to be permantly expanaded,
I didn't find any that would stay closed.
