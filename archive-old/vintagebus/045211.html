Hey, my friend has been building his 23 window for over 5 years. We drove

it the other day but it just died and we can't figure out why. OK, here's

the deal; it has an electric fuel pump with dual carbs on a 1600. It also

has a new wiring harness and an altenator with an internal regulator. When

we first got it running, we accidently installed a voltage regulator with

the altenator. We started the bus and got going so fast we had to shut the

safari windows, then 10 minutes after we got it going, it just died. No

power to the fuel pump the we could hear, and the engine wouldn't turn

over. The lights did still work though. So today we took the voltage

regulator out and got it started again by jumping the bus with a spare

battery. It was running really good until 10 minutes again when it just

stopped. No power, and the whole 9 yards. We changed the fuse that goes to

the coil ('cause that's what we have the fuel pump running off of) and it

ran again for only 10 minutes. The fuel hose isn't getting hot and vapor

locking, and the fuses and wiring look good. So what's the deal? we've

basically run out of ideas. I'm going over after work tomarrow to try to

figure it out, so if anybody has any suggestions they would be greatly

appreciated since we HAVE to get this bus done before Manassas in May, and

it's not looking too good right now.

I am confused you said when it died the engine would not turn over?  To me
this means when you turn the key to start it the engine does not spin.  If you
meant it did not catch...

was the fuse bad that you switched?

did you check for gas flow?  one guy turning the key up from while the other
watches the filter or if you tae the hose off the carb to see if it comes out
there and yells &quot;stop!&quot; when it does   or &quot;#%$%$#!&quot; went it doesn't.     why
an electric fuel pump?  if the pump is the problem then switch back to a
regular one, they are fairly sturdy.     Are the plug wires on correctly and
well attached?

If a bus dies it is usually gas air or spark.   The idiot book explains how to
check for them.

you may want to try it next time with the bus running in the drive way so you
dont get stuck somewhere.
