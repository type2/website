Subject: Throttle pedal/cable sticking and leaking gas in engine compartment!

First. my 1965 splittie idles too high because the gas pedal sticks and does
not return to full upright. I went back to look at the carb spring and found
two springs on the carb, both looking sad. The problem is not the carpet.

I've seen many posts about a gas pedal rebuild. I do not understand why, but
expect that my problem is:
1. need new carb spring
2. need to make sure carpet secured and not pushing on pedal
3. maybe the pedal hinge needs some oiling or something???

Anyone know if this is a common type II problem?

Second, it looks that the dualport gas intakes from the carb are leaking
fuel. It seems to be coming from the weld joint where the pipe goes to dual
port (on both sides!)Any recommendations here? If I have to spend $ to fix
this, would it be better to upgrade to a better than stock carb set up? My
stock 72' type I 1600cc could sure use some umph.


Thanks in advance,
