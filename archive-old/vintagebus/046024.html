&lt;&lt; I need to temporarily swap engines between my bug and bus (won't bother to 
explain why).  I will be taking a 12v DP 1600 from the bus and putting it 
into a 1966
 6v bug. I would like the bug to remain 6v.  Other than the obvious (swapping 
generator, regulator, coil et al.) what are the issues I might encounter?&gt;&gt;
Hi Thomas,
You will need to change the muffler, air cleaner made for bus and rejet the 
carb for use with bus aircleaner, muffler and engine compartment.

&lt;&lt;Will the 12v flywheel go in the 6v bell housing?  Will the starter line up 
and work?   &gt;&gt;
Not without grinding the tranny bellhousing or installing a 200mm 6 volt FW.  
Not witout replacing the 6 volt bushing with a 12 volt one or installing the 
200mm 6 volt FW.   Eric&amp;Barb
