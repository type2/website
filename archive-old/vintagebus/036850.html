Anyone in the Phoenix area have a doghouse fan shroud you can sell me?  The
chrome POS that was on my engine is falling apart and could have done my
engine some harm (I'll check it out in the AM)!  If any one has one they can
part with, give me a call at (602)877-8662.  I won't be home tonight but you
can leave me a message and I'll get back to you in the AM.  I have the motor
out and need to get it back in the DC before Monday's trip to work.

Thanks in advance,

Jon
'61 DC
