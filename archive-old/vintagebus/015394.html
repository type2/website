The &quot;vintage plate&quot; rules are different in every state, but I can't
think of a single state that would let you have a different plate on 
the front than the back, vintage or not, show or not.  I saw a 930
in Carmel one time with a standard serial plate on the back, and
a personalized plate on the front; I wonder how long he'd been doing 
*that*!

If anyone wants an explanation of the *California* YOM rules, lemme know.
