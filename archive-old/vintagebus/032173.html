In addition to what Clara suggested also remember to unhook the battery
prior to disassembling and cleaning the starter connections. When crossing
the terminals between the big red wire (comes from the ignition switch) and
the 13mm nut wires (hot- to battery) remember to reconnect the battery,
have the vehicle in neutral and secured with wheel chocks and/or ebrake.
You are going to be under the bus, right?

Some one else had a problem with their bus not starting after a long hot
drive...

It is typical around my local area &lt;Phoenix,AZ&gt; to install an old school GM
or FORD starter relay in the starter circuit and mounted in the vacinity of
the starter to minimize the length of the hot wire. Resistance builds up in
the long wires running the full length of the bus up to the ignition switch
and back to the starter. I'm not anymore than a very scarey novice when it
comes to 'lectricity so check the Hoover comments or basic Electical theory
references. All I know is that an appropriate starter relay can help.
Likewise check other sources for the proper install of one of these relays.
I've learned the hard way to make sure that the battery is disconnected
prior to messing with hot connections in an remove and inspect task.
(Bzzzzt, smoke!!!!!) ;--0 
Have one of the starter relay setups on the '67 RFH and need to put a 6volt
one on the '54 barndoor. It was the routine during the OCTO/Classic weekend
to see me roll under the bus and jump it via the &quot;crossing&quot; method
everytime we stopped. The replacement starter button that I found at the
OCTO didn't completely fix my troubles. Golden hearted Richard K &lt;Rustybus&gt;
and Everette Barnes helped push several times.

Start with Clara's good suggestions.
