Subject: [VB] Door opening on the move?!?!?!?

Hey gang,

I installed new door rubber in my double cab this weekend and later when =
I went for a spin the passenger door swung open on its own.  When I got =
home and inspected the lock mechanism, it seems to work fine but the =
latch part isn't fully locking out to catch the door jamb.  The door =
does seem to sit a little less flush than it did before the new rubber =
(it had no rubber though before I installed this rubber).  If I trim =
down the rubber will this help?  I was nervous to do this because I =
don't want to loose the seal and let in water/air.  Does a '63 inside =
door handle have a &quot;locked&quot; position, or just open and close?=20
