Subject: RE: [VB] Ypsilanti

Hi all,

I made it back from Ypsilanti about an hour ago.  1600 mile round trip in
the '56; stock 36hp.  My butt is really tired.  Everything went fine except
a broken belt on the Mass Pike this morning.  I had the ambulance divider
closed to cut down noise and the back of the bus was full of smoke before I
realized there was a problem.  Very exciting for a couple minutes but no
harm done.  I didn't get any clay or the sub hatch westy but I was seriously
tempted by the double door panel that was for sale.  If only the garage was
a little bigger...

I'll have pics up later this evening.
