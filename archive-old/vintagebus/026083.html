&gt; I have a concrete pad on the side of the house, next to the garage.

Thom,

I put a temporary cover in front of my garage that is almost exactly those
dimensions.
Since I used the pipe/tarp shelters that are now at Home Depot ($170), I was
not required to get a permit.
One of the city guys dropped by and took a LONG look at it, got back in his
truck and kept going.  It also weathered the storm that I had in dealing with
the city and my truck (non-op) parked in the driveway.

I put it length wise in front of the garage.
It is about 25 x 13'
On the side up against the garage, I removed all of the poles and bolted it
to the garage using lag bolts and 1 hole conduit straps.
On the side away from the garage, I left the two outside poles and staked
them to the ground.

It has so far withstood both huge gale storm type winds from both mother
nature and city fathers.

Since this whole thing could be removed in minutes, there is nothing to worry
about from landlords and permit people.
