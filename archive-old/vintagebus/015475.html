This is a commonly recurring thread.  There are more and more repro
parts out there, but it seems the quality is decling exponentially.

Greg and I were discussing the CE safaris last night.  We both ran
into issues installing them.  Greg has a pair of originals on-hand
(which I don't) and was able to compare the two much more critically
than I was.  The biggest problem we both ran into was the inner latches
hitting.  Mine hit the base itself, his hits the screws.  Dave from
CE told me you have to &quot;machine&quot; (ie, grind) a bit off the bottom of
the latch, and that because of the production methods VW used, no two
buses are exactly alike.  He told me my dash is too high.  Frankie
nails with when he says the frames are too damn long.  While the units
seem OK unto themselves, the don't seem to stack up very well against
the originals.  Our consensus is that at first blush it doesn't appear
that they are worth the premium over Izzy's, especially when you
factor in the shipping and currency fluctuations.  For the record, I
have not installed a set of Izzy's yet, so I could be talking out
my a** in that regard.  Greg is more qualified to give a detailed
dissertation on what's wrong with the CE safaris vs factory.

I also have run into crappy other repop parts, like those door bumpers
I bought from a certain ebay vendor.  Doctor, it hurts when I do that!
Yeah, it was $4 for two sets, but you get what you pay for.  Gawd these
things are CRAP!  

My advice (which I am going to follow myself) is to not buy &quot;new&quot; parts 
on ebay.  When you step back and think about it, it makes sense:
*) why should you compete (bid) against other people for retail stuff 
which normally goes for a fixed price?  Why do people do this - I've
seen off-the-shelf electronic stuff go for way over retail prices
on ebay.  Would you go to the store and bid on milk and bread?  Can
you imagine being on the phone ordering stuff, say with Ronnie, and
he puts you on hold for a second, comes back and says &quot;That seal which was
$20, is now $25 - someone just outbid you&quot;
*) Ok, so the bidding price is below the catalog price.  Probably means
is a Third World (no offence to listees from Alabama and Arizona) imitation 
of a repro part.  That's been my experience.  Paid slightly less than
WCM prices for bits which were not up to WCM quality.
