Subject: Re: [VB] ceramic coating

I have a headers on my '86 GMC that were ceramic coated. They have been installed for about 2 years
and first of all the bright finish began to get dull after about 6 months of use. Also, they are
beginnning to get small dots of rust on them as well.

The brand name of the headers is Dynomax which are supposed to be a quality brand. I don't know if
there are degrees of quality of the coating that is applied. Anyone know?

I have a header that is ceramic coated from Kymco. Looks great. Have not put
it in the bus so I cannot vouch for durability.

The header does have flanges on the heat exchanger ends so I will have to
weld flanges onto my H.E.'s before installing. I am tired of those silly
clamps that always leak.
