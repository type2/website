Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 08-07-03

Been doin' a little bit of a whole lotta nuthin' this week on the '61 
Double Cab Rat Bus project.

I do have 3 of the 4 wheels/tires/hubcaps done and mounted. For each 
wheel I have buffed the white walls on the tires to be wide, 
installed new hubcab clips, mounted the wheel, and polished the 
hubcap for that wheel. I got lucky, the bus came with all four 
original VW hubcaps. They've all got small imperfections, but when 
you polish 'em up they get nice and shiney you don't even notice that 
stuff.

The hubcap clips I cheated and just replaced the ones that are 
missing. I'm using the same technique I used on my '59 Kombi. I drill 
a dimple in the backside of the rivet. Then with a hammer and punch I 
bang it right out. Something about the little dimple lets the rivit 
cave in from the edges and come out real easy. You barely have to 
drill and it really makes those suckers just pop right out.

Then I use some flat headed 8 X 1/2 screws with lock washers and nuts 
to install the replacement clips. The flat head sinks right down 
where the rivet goes and doesn't interfere with the drum. The lock 
washer keeps 'em in place. If the clip ever breaks it makes it easy 
to replace. Plus no banging around with rivets to install them 
either. On these wheels it doesn't matter as much, but if you've got 
some nice pretty wheels you really don't want to be banging around 
them with a big hammer.

So, I still have the last wheel to do. I PLAN on doing it tommarrow 
after work. Haven't decided if I'm gonna go ahead and spray flames on 
it this weekend or just wait for that. Most likely I'll give the 
flames a shot. They'll really finish it off nice. Won't have too many 
other excuses after that.
