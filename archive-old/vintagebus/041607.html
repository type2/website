Whenever I meet a bus driver at shows or on the street and want to give
them info about the lists I think &quot;wouldn't it be nice to have a flyer
that explains what the lists are about and how to find them?&quot;
Wel it happened again today so I made one. Its a jpeg and should be
printable straight off the web page.
