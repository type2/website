&gt; I picked up a 1 inch drive breaker bar for $15.  Now the problem is
finding
&gt; 1 inch drive sockets.  I founf a place that special order A 36mm
socket but
&gt; it would set me back $29.  I will just sit back and wait for another
good
&gt; deal on sockets comes around.

1 inch!!  You could twist the end of the axle off with that sucker!

You are now the champion of the &quot;Manly-Man socket wrench competition&quot;.
 Us folk with mere 3/4 inch equipment bow down to you!  :)
