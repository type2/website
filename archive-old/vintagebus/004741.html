&gt; how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and after
restoration?
&gt;
I won't say rare because I've seen a few.

There's at least 1 in Florida (listee), my friend had one that sold to
England (Euro model), I know of a couple Barndoor '55s, one of them here in
Phoenix, and there's one on recycler_dot_com for $5k right now, seems over
priced by the photo there.

Oh yeah, and Thom might spring to have that logo'd one in NorCal air-lifted
out.  Do it!  ;)

So that's 6 off the top of my head.  Scarce, I'd say.  '55s rule.

BTW, there's a '55 Kombi for sale in my classifieds right now, $4k, sounds
pretty good.
