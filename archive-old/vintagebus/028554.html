Hi all;
The attached Letter to the Editor was published in my local paper this
morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to write back. I can think of
dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I would share his letter
with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to destroy this guy's
nonsense.
Anyone feeling like adding a comment or two to tell this guy please reply
with your comment. I'll edit the whole thing with the strongest facts (there
is a length limit required by the paper) and send a reply. I'll need to do
this within the next two days.
I recall Jack Maynard had a great piece written about this subject some
years ago.
Or perhaps we should write individual emails to the editor and bombard them
with replies??
Thanks for your input.

&quot;Give SUVs a break.
I find the furor that many anti-SUV Kuddites bring up to the most amusing,
as are the many &quot;facts&quot; that they pull out of the air to prove how
deleterious a sport utility vehicle will be on Earth. Well, excuse me for
living.
I used to drive an early 1970's Volkswagen van, not unlike some of the aging
relics seen even now around the Willamette Valley. I've enjoyed the economy
of movement, not to mention the acceleration, these vehicles employ.
My point? The SUV I own now has comparable, if not better, gas mileage than
the old clunker had. Even when I gave my VW van the best tune up I could
give it, drove with a tail wind and kept it unloaded, its mileage was not
better than my much reviled current vehicle.
Only now, I have the option of having my feet warm and keeping the
windshield defrosted on a cold day. I can accelerate much better now, thank
you very much.
So, for all those blowhards who are constantly whining about the evils of
SUVs, get a life! Get rid of your clunky Volkswagens. Put forth an example.&quot;
