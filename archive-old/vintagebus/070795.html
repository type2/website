Subject: axle-beam lock-plate problem

Hi folks,
I'm currently re-installing my axle-beam. According to the VW workshop manual
the mounting-bolt lock plates must sit in a particular direction (each one is
different). I'm having trouble with the upper rearward plate. When I place it
in the specified position (with the flat of the plate pointing rearward along
the lip of the beam mount as per the manual's diagram) the hole does not align
with the beam's hole. All eight plates are exactly the same, so I'm not using
the wrong one.

Is this not as critical as the book implies? It will fit fine with the flat
pointing up or down. Should I just stick it on as it fits and move on? I guess
that's my only option. So... a more poignant question- is the manual wrong?
Mine isn't a Bentley re-print. I believe it's a first edition &quot;Workshop Manual
Type 2, all models&quot; original for the VW workshops- &quot;1968  Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft, Wolfsburg All Rights Reserved - Printed in Germany 532 531
20. 7. 68&quot; as per the copyright page.

Do the later Bentley's correct this seeming problem?

I'd appreciate your thoughts. Thanks,
