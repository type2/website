Here is the deal. I have a 1969 Pintail 14&quot; sloop rigged daysailer. Hull is
in good shape, all the spars and rigging are good, sails are from a
Windmill. This is a really fun boat and includes a nice trailer and a 1963
3hp Johnson 2 lunger outboard with  folding prop shaft. The boat displaces
about 500 lbs and is a centerboarder. The whole rig on the trailer weighs in
at about 700lbs. I is worth a little under two grand.

I would like to trade it a decent 1971 or earlier bus, camper, single or
double cab in decent shape. I already have a 1600sp on deck ready to go so
the motor is not an issue.

If you are interested p-mail me.
