Subject: Re: [VB] Walk thru Double Cab...

I have a walkthru Kombi and can tell you from experience an 11 month old,
85# Rott/Dane rambunctious pup is not a good combo. But he does keep the
shifter and dash clean licking them.....lol. Might have to start carrying a
fly swatter in the Kombi. My room mate has both my dogs very obedient to a
fly swatter......LMAO. Between my Chi-wa-wa (Bart) and my Rott/Dane (Homer)
my van is pretty safe when they are in it. Bart - stage one alarm and
triggers second stage - Homer.......lol.

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!
