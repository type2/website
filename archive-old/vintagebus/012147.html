Subject: re: leaking bus/door panels
Mime-Version: 1.0

Not sure what to do about the windows, but I have heard two different solutions for keeping your door panels from warping.

1. Paint POR-15 on the back of the panels. This should seal them, preventing them from warping

2. Line door with trash bag and duct tape, between door frame and panel, theis keeps water away from door panel.

I am not sure which method is best, I think the POR-15 method should be easier. I need to do this on my bus myself, I just haven't had time, the PO put new panels in, and didn't seal them, so they are popping all the push-button-clamp-thingys.

Anyone have info as to which is the better method, and why?

I was also hoping to change the push clamps used on my '65 with screws like the earlier model buses. I think the screws look nicer, and it would make it easier to take the panel on and off to check for rust inside the door.

I was thinking of plugging the hole in the doors(where the push thingys go)with a chunck of rubber and then screwing into that.

One last question, what are those push thingys called?
