Hi Ed,
 The problem with painting a steel bulb holder is thereafter you have 
problems with electrical contact and when you scrape off the paint to allow 
metal to metal contact the corrosion starts in those areas to cause more 
problems down the road.  Normal chrome plating is best, but expensive due to 
the hand labor to polish each of the layers of plating even before the chrome 
plating.  There are chrome shops that will flash chrome plate parts (Turning 
out like the chrome finish of vintage Hazet tools.) which since practicly no 
hand work is used is a inexpensive way to plate parts.  Eric&amp;Barb
