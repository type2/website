Ok, my two cents:  you own a beautiful car in any condition and you are on a
great drive no matter where you are headed, why waste the view sucking
exhaust from a truck and endanger your car, while introducing the stress of
watching his taillights.  Just sit back, relax, enjoy the car, the road and
the view.  If you want to get their quickly you wouldn't own a bus.

&gt; the hazard triangle sounds good to me too- think I'll use that idea next
time
&gt; I take the 53 on the freeway.

I was working on an idea for a list sticker along these lines like a year
ago. The bits are at www.type2_dot_com/~andy     scroll down. Anybody is
welcome to tweak or steal. I think I still have the photoshop bits.
I will mail them to anyone that want to work on it.
I thought (still do) that it would make a good list fundraiser.
