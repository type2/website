Subject: early vs late push button doors?

Can anyone tell me the specific differences between a
67 door and one from, say, 65?

I need a driver's side cab door for my 67, and located
one from a 64 (?). Other than the missing speed nuts
to mount the pull handle along the top in the
doorpanel holes, what about the latch? I've heard 67
was a one-year only latch.

Thanks, Jason
