Subject: Re: [VB] Question for the PNW-ers...Wiper motor Q

Is the motor noisey?   if so, that indicates you should remove the motor and 
regrease it.

I've written about that procedure a couple times, it should be in the 
archives. After you remove the motor, unscrw the cover (NOT the snap over 
cover), clean the hardened plastic that used to be grease out, pack with new 
grease, grease linkages at every joint, reinstall.

This past summer was a fluke.   Having a dry summer was wierd... it didn't 
rain for I think an entire 2 months

 I just arrived here, South of Seattle in mid summer, when it was DRY.
 
 Well...It is not so dry these days.  I would really like to have my wipers
 up to par, and I am having problems that I haven't seen addressed as yet.
 
 First off, I have a 63' panel, been running 12 volts since I have owned it.
 
 My wipers are hooked up, AND WORK - sort of.  Here is my observation.  The
 wipers are VERY slow.  There doesn't seem to be a voltage drop however,
 which I find confusing.  They even stop often, like they don't have the
 power to scrape the glass.  I can nudge them, and they continue on their
 sweep.  The sweep is slower from Driver-to-Passenger side, and then pick up
 a bit going the other direction.
 
 I was wondering/hoping this would be some sort of procedure, like pulling
 the wiper motor, and re-greasing it.  Looking for documentation, somewhere.
 Is it in the Bentley?  Tips? Tricks?
 
 Hopefully not a burnt motor..!
