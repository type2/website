Hey everyone,

The re-animation is complete.  I drove the 67 Westy hard top (DC master, no back up lights, AC plug at the rear.._dot_usually on the drivers side for 67's) out of the driveway and around the block a few times.  It goes, stops, turns, blinks, and honks.  About the only thing I can't get to work is the original radio.  It turns on, but all I get is a buzz.  This bus was sitting since at least 1984.  She is a rust bucket and has smashed corners and nose, but at least she is mechanically sound now and is back on the road!

Thanks to everyone who sent me answers to my questions!  A few more though.

I bled the brakes a few times, but I still have to pump up the brakes.  Should I rip the MC apart to check it or adjust again and bleed again?

The front end is fairly tight, but how do I center up the steering wheel so that it is correct when I'm going straight?

I'll be adding this one to Thoms site and the NEATO registry.

Thanks.

Steve
