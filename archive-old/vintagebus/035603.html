If its a 58 binz, Easiest way to tell is its a &quot;pressed&quot; bumper doublecab.
VW didnt make them, I think.
If its a 59, check out this
Second is the big side windows behind the front cab doors.
Ice pick cargo door handle.
hacked down side gates with nasty welds in the middle
Binz ID tag.
Weirdo rear seat
Im sure theres other stuff, but these are pretty much giveaways
