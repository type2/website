Buses  came with plastic escutcheons in the front, and chrome ones for the 
cargo  doors.

Cargo door... panel... spring (light) ... chrome  ring..handle
Front doors... spring or foam square...panel...  ring...handle

I think the ones with screws for the front door inner  handle had foam 
squares 
with hole cut for the handle to go  through,

the pin handles had pretty hurky springs.

installation  tips:  http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~sunrisebus/install.html

Didn't deluxes come with chrome escutcheons on the front?  Mike
