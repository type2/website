Isaiah,

I don't know about the EMPI unit but it should not need power as the sending
unit generates millivolts to operate the gauge. My VDO has the sender under
a plug like the crush washer. My previous one (S.W. maybe? - oh that
oldsheimers) was in the form of a clip that went over one of the head fins.
Good luck finding an EMPI sender.

Subject: [VB] cylinder head temp gauge


&gt; hello all...
&gt; I just picked up an EMPI cylinder head temp gauge (60-140 degrees
&gt; celsius range) and all I got was the gauge with a thick wire coming out
&gt; of the back...and the light bulb in the gauge.  I'm wondering how I go
&gt; about hooking this up.  It looks just like, and is the same size as, a
&gt; bus gas gauge.  it has the 2 threaded posts and the light bulb fixture
&gt; on it just like the gas gauge too... but other than that...it just has
&gt; this fat wire coming out of it.  I imagine this goes to the sending
&gt; unit.  I've never hooked one of these up before...and have a few
&gt; questions.  for one..how does it get power?  does one just run this big
&gt; fat wire to the sending unit?  How should I mount the sending unit...and
&gt; what part of the head should I put it in?  Where can I get a sending
&gt; unit for it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks! - Isaiah
