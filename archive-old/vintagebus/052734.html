Let's see...I'll chime in...
For the 63EZ:

new heater box to body tubes
a new set of safari windows &lt;cha-ching!&gt;
also got it an early present back in Oct...nice little single wheel trailer.

&gt; since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been wondering about
&gt; the last few days:
&gt; how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for your
&gt; volkswagen(s)?

&gt; I'm giving mine the week off but would love new mirrors for my F-150! ;-0
