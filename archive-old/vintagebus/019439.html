Subject: URGENT question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

this is not a bus question, however it is a bug
question (which is my daily driver) while the bus is
slowly being restored. recently i bent the master
cylinder pushrod assembly on the bug (finding out
while stopping at a red light) and bam! the brakes go
out. luckily it was night and no one was in my way. i
cannot seem to find a shop that carries the master
cylinder pushrod assembly leaving me with no car. if
anyone knows where one is please tell me!! it would be
greatly appreciated it is for a 72 superbeetle
