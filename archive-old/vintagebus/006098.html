Read it again, Ronnie. The Burn Camp received all of the proceeds from the
events, such as charity auctions, chili cookoffs and such. The club rounded
these proceeds up to an even thousand as is customary. The Animal Benefit
Club is a no-kill shelter and is entirely privately funded. They received
$5000 because they do good work and because they have the cool initials. A
nice step towards the clubs ultimate goal. Once all of our buses are sold to
the Japanese for a bazillion dollars, we will all attend Jerome in Prevost
motorhomes. Then all of us millionaires can spend a fortune on raffle
tickets and donate a billion dollars to charity. May take a year or two, but
we're working on it every chance we get.

&gt; I guess I should have read the rest of the news letter from A B C, the
&gt; donation wasn't $6000.00 but $5000.00 and the charity wasn't the burn camp
&gt; but an animal shelter.
