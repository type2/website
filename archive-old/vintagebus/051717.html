Subject: Give me a VW Bus anyday

   Kinda of bus revelent. I have been doing the rear brakes on my F#_at_D
diesel www.volksrescue_dot_com truck the last few days and I must admit that I
would rather rebuild a set of RGB then do the rear brakes on a truck. What a
PITA they are. There are more parts to the rear brakes of a truck then all 4
VW wheels combined. Now I know why I love VW's so much, easy and
inexpensive. I was shocked though that the rear brake shoes, drums and new
wheel cylinders for the truck cost LESS then on a VW Bus and they are some
massive units on the truck, go figure.

ronnie  
www.volksresue_dot_com   used buses and OG parts in there natural state, coming
soon to the web near you.
