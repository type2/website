&lt;&lt; &gt;Hmmm....thats what people said in '51,'61, and '71 about their busses&gt;

 &gt;
 And they were right.
  &gt;&gt;
I have this wonderful ad I got out of an old magazine.   Has a picture of a 
shiny new SRW/BD deluxe under the caption &quot;VW bus '61&quot; and an shiny new 
orange vanagon under the caption &quot;VW bus '81&quot;  

AFTER TWENTY YEARS WE FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT.

and a blurb about how it was right 20 years ago, but so much better now.  
though some people still think it's funny looking

still, if given the choice, I 'd like that 61 deluxe, please.  would you 
rather have the vanagon?
