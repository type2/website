&gt; If your accelerator cable tube is coming through the fan housing it sound like

&gt; My set up has the tube running through the fan shrouding, with an odd angled
&gt; end on it to keep it from going all the way through(towards the front).
&gt; 
&gt; The accelrator cable passes through this.
&gt; 
&gt; I put a spring over the accelerator cable. Then another tube of some sort, now
&gt; my accelrator cable has a bulge in it at this point. A clip goes over the
&gt; accelrator cable, keepint the second tube spring loaded against the first
&gt; tube, thereby keeping the tubue in the fan shroud in place. 

This sounds like the early setup, with a spring on the cable itself.  The
later setup had the return spring on the carb and nothign but friction to
hold the cable guide tube in the shroud.  I use a little hose clamp as
well.
