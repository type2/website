&lt;&lt; I was told by someone i trust that the internals of a t3 cooler are 
different that it has more oil passages etc than a t1 cooler... &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
We have counted the passages, took note that the cooling fins in between are 
the same size.  Unless there is a fouth diamension the T3, it is the same as 
the T1 doghouse.  The T4 on the other hand has seven passages instead of the 
five that the T3 &amp; T1 doghouse coolers.  All three coolers are actually made 
for the same components!    Eric&amp;Barb
