Subject: Distributor questions
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.3.95.980914235837.4813B-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

I was asked a question today I didn't know the answer to, so I throw it
out here for group consideration..... 

As y'all know, I am not as big fan of the 009/050 mechanical distributors.
They may be fine for drag racing, but they have flaws that make driving
them on the street painful.  At the same time, I acknowledge that throwing
in an 009 will get you running, if not well, then at least acceptably.

A friend asked me, if I was so opposed to 009's, what did I recommend for
the T1 engine as a &quot;universal&quot; vacuum advance dist?  What dist can he just
drop in to any 1600 DP and get back on the road?  Well, looking in Bentley
for busses produces 15 different dists used in the 11 years from 68-79,
the Bentley for the 70-79 bug produces 9 more and I have no idea! 

If it exists, this dist should produce acceptable performace on any 1600
DP, should time at 7.5 BTDC and should only be vac advance, so it can be
installed in a bus w/o or with a malfunctioning vac retard circuit.  Also,
assuming a PICT34 carb, which vac port should it plug to? 

I looked in both my bug and bus books and see no real obvious candidate,
but I don't have that much experience in the T1 engine world any more.

Also, seeing the range of pulleys used from 68-71 in both bugs and busses,
how the heck do you tell which one you have?????  Back when I was into
bugs (I'm giving away my age here :-), they all had a 0, 7,5 and 10 degree
notches.  Now they all seem to have one notch, but depending on year it
can be at 7.5 before, 0 or 5 ATDC.  Since I know I will be &quot;laying hands
on&quot;  this bus eventually, should I plan on buying and bringing a degree
wheel pulley with me?  He has no idea what engine or pulley he has, just
knows he isn't really happy with his 009.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
