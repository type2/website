&lt;&lt; hey hows it going?  no i took the lug nuts off already but i need to get
the drum nuts off, 4 of them, and the drum rotates and they move with the
wheel.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Pretty good.  Loosening the rear axle nuts with the VW on jacks or jackstands
is a very good way to damage the VW and very possibly injure/maim/kill
yourself by having the VW fall off from all your torqueing around on it.  Put
back on the lugbolts, and wheels lower the bus back onto the ground.  Then use
a 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar, preferably a Proto L-bar that you can buy for about
$35.00 with the right size socket that will fit both the breaker bar and rear
axle nuts.  Also you might need a cheater bar of up to 6' long.  Then with the
rear axle nuts loosened jack the bus back up remove the wheels (Wheels = tires
and rims.) from the drums again and take off the bearing covers off the front
drums.  Then depending on which you have, either loosen the lock nuts on each
front drum with an allen wrench, or loosening the one lock nut from the other
once you bend the lock washer out of the way.  Remember that all threaded
fasteners on these VW loosen by turning counter clockwise, except the one and
only front left axle nut/s which loosens by turning clockwise.  Lastly get
yourself a copy of the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual ASAP.  You
can not only kill yourself working on the VW, but can easily set yourself up
for a crash later while driving it by not having done the mechanical work
properly.  Eric &amp; Barb
