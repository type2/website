Subject: Re: [VB] AN INTERACTIVE VINTAGE BUS EMAIL!


&gt; heres a little thing i whipped up just to get to know more about you folk! 
&gt; and to help us all get more aquanted...
&gt; 
&gt; 1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac?

Late teens, half the guys were Dub fanatics, racing the other half in V8s ;^)
 
&gt; 2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if there 
&gt; not all the same)

1961 Morris Major, 1961 Beetle, 1974 Sopru Campmobile

&gt; 3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this email 
&gt; wiill be HUGE!)

1 :o( Just the Camper, neither of the DCs is running yet.

&gt; 4. do you have a favorite? wich one?

For now, Camper (as it runs), I'm expecting that the DC will take over.

&gt; 5. stock or custom?

Custom, a bit more go, bit better handling, bit more comfort, look a bit 
different from the rest, you know?

&gt; 6.would you punch an alien?

No, we may be related ;^)
