I was going to use &quot;nut-serts&quot; when I do the bed in my 60 Double Cab. These are basically rivet in threads. You can then remove your screws from above without holding any nuts down below. This would allow you to use some sort of oil finish that could be redone every year or so. The wood slats on my tilt only lasted for about two years with top quality marine grade spar varnish. I followed the directions exactly. The real pain about this stuff is removing it before refinishing. That is the nice
thing with the oil type finishes, they may not last as long, but they are quick to re-do.
hope this helps,
