Found this article while searching for something else.  Sounds like the
ultimate security system for a high-value collectable veehickle.

FWIW.....

World's first over-the-counter Internet GPS tracking system for cars
8 February 2001

Immobiliser Inc. is introducing the world's first over-the-counter wireless
vehicle tracking and control system using the Internet and Global
Positioning System (GPS) technology.

Vehicle owners from anywhere in the world will be able to track and control
their vehicles in areas where the service is available by using the Internet
and GPS Vision technology. The first roll-out will be in Texas soon.

Car owners receive the vehicle's street address location, digital mapping,
car speed and direction in seconds via the Internet. For example, parents on
holiday in Europe could receive an alarm notification and shut down the
operation of their car in Houston if a child is out on a joyride in the
family car. If that sounds too potentially dangerous an application, other
uses could be if a driver accidentally locks the keys in the car and can
remotely unlock the door through an Internet-enabled cell phone, two-way
pager or PDA.

Business owners may find this device particularly useful. Owners of service
trucks can actually put an alarm sensor on a toolbox door and receive
notification when someone makes an unauthorized entry. Fleet owners will be
able to shut down the use of their vehicles and equipment after hours,
decreasing the risk of vehicles being used without proper authorization.
Through GPS Vision, an owner could even start a vehicle engine from a
distance, even from another country.

With a PDA, two-way pager or e-mail enabled cell phone, car owners can track
and control their vehicle while walking down the street. If a vehicle is
stolen, for example, owners could use a Palm or other Internet-enabled
device to send a command to track the vehicle by street location and speed,
and then notify the police of the car's exact location.

The technology has the potential to give vehicle owners with existing
vehicle alarms the means to protect and monitor their car via their home
phone, cell phone, pager, PDA and e-mail.

The system requires only three inputs and outputs, and is a plug-and-play
unit that should work with any make or model vehicle. It is also designed to
be installed on motorcycles.
