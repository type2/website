&lt;&lt; Thanks, you can't argue with the numbers.  But a previous question now

resurfaces from early December-See below.   No numbers on this one.  It's

long enough to clear most any bumper but doesn't fit the crank start nut. It

was determined to be an industrial engine crank also.  Were there different

industrial cranks?

 &gt;&gt;

Anyone evere seen the elusive July 58 through May of 59 crank handle???
