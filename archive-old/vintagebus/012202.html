Subject: broke instrument panel.
Date: Tue, 01 Dec 1998 12:36:59 PST

  My 65´ Kombi has the front instrument panel cut in the part of the 
stereo was. I think the past owner wanted to put another kind of bigger 
stereo instead the original and broke the panel.
  
  I dont know how fix the problem, notice that i cant have a hole new 
panel instrument because i live in Mexico and it is almost impossible to 
get one. I think i should make an implant or something.

What do you think?....
