Subject: year of poput latch change?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9909121340150.55388-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

I am looking at a 61 bus and something came up.

it has high hinges, but the later poput latches with teh little plastic
button thingy, not spoons.

I have seen low hinge 61's with spoons, so im thinking this isnt correct.
No-one ive asked knows when the changeover was, and the reference books i
have dont address this either.  (archive search didnt help, but maybe i
did it wrong...)

so anyway, when _did_ vw ditch the spoons?

thanks,

Steve
