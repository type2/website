I'm 6' 3 and I have a walk-through, with the standard seats I have to hunch
over a little to see out, but I'm still comfortable, it just takes getting
used to.

&gt; actually I've got a walk-thru, but maybe I'll check into the 914 seat.
&gt;  or plan on getting shorter with age...
&gt; Yeah I can't imagine putting that sun visor down.  I'd be completely
&gt; blind!

&gt; &gt;Chris,
&gt; &gt;  Bet you have a bench seat! I'm 6'2&quot; also. Walkthroughs
&gt; &gt;are better for tall drivers. I had to put in a 914 seat
&gt; &gt;to prevent back and shoulder hunching, not to mention
&gt; &gt;traffic collisions.  I still haven't put in the sun
&gt; &gt;visors because they're never needed.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I've started driving my '65 every day and wondering:  anybody else have
&gt; &gt;&gt;trouble seeing through the front window?  I'm 6'2&quot; and my eye level is
&gt; &gt;&gt;even with the top of the window unless i bend myself into a question
&gt; &gt;&gt;mark.  Hard to see the signal change....
