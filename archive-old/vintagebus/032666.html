i finally got around to putting my &quot;new&quot; (to me) speedo in my 61 westy. 
thanks Clay! after cleaning out the parcel tray (wow, so much stuff) i got
the new one in and everything put back together.  i also installed a 12V
old, large Bosch horn from a '67 mercedes.  now i have that sweet mellow
tone when i beep at someone, and not that bleep of the current production
hella horns.  after not having a speedo that worked for the past 6 months,
it sure is weird to look down and see the needle moving.  it's also
interesting that i have been driving these things for so long, i can shift
at the correct times without even needing to look at the speedo for the red
lines that tell when to shift.  now that the needle moves again, i looked
down when i was shifting, and voila! right on every time.  aaahhh, those
sweet rpm's. (and no tachometer)  ....and what gas gauge?
