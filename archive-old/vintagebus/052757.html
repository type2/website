Subject: Dworkin's Used bits-how to/who to contact?

A friend advised that I have an ad (five or more years old) still sitting on
Dworkin's Used bits site.
http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts/person-index-jim-ellis.html
I had no idea that it was still out there. 
I personally dont use that site. [No Ford parts... ;-)]
The solution to that 5+ year old problem is now an obvious no-brainer at this
point in time. 

Attemps at contacting &quot;webmaster_at_village_dot_org&quot; failed.
If anyone on this list runs the site or can help please do so. Full permissions
given to delete ad as mentioned.
Thanks-apologies for the bandwidth (that also was a problem 5 years ago...)
