Subject: final decisions...

well its time to make some decisions now that my shop is getting torn
down..
Where is the best place to get a wiring harness from?  Wireworks?  John
at Aircooled_dot_net seems to like his.  Ron at Busdepot? (He's got nice
prices :)

I'd like it to be cheaper (as does anyone) but I DO NOT want to have to
splice the thing to make it fit.  I don't have the time to do this.

Please advise.

Thanks!
