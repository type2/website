&gt; the VW program that the History Channel made.  One
&gt; striking piece of video shows dozens of barndoor buses (and nothing
&gt; else) being driven around a circle.
&gt; 
&gt; Where can I get a copy of this?  I don't have cable.  (I know,
everyone has cable, but hey, I drive a bus, own a house older than I
am, and vaccuum with a 1950's Kirby.  That new fangled stuff scares me.
 I will need that copy on Beta (just kidding).)
&gt; 
&gt; Richard (Nothing beats watching a bunch of barndoors driving in
circles... just look at the barndoor caravan to California) K.
&gt;just turn on the history channel. they give an 800 line to call for
all vids. terry
