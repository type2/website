Subject: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help!

&gt;Well, I go to clean the strainer, and find lots of metallic flakes and
&gt;pieces, which are also in the waste oil.  The pieces are about a 32nd of an
&gt;inch square, and some are like small fingernail clippings.  The amount that
&gt;came out in the oil is about enough to fill a thimble, maybe two, maybe
&gt;more......  I dont know if its magnetic or not, but I think it is magnesium,
&gt;from the inside of the case.  Why do i think this, because I feel the motor
&gt;may have over heated and caused it to flake off the inside

Looks like main bearing residue to me. Cases don't flake. Hippies do.
Bearings are shiny and not magnetic. Whatever the source , the case must be split
and the cooler cleaned very well or replaced, these shavings will destroy your engine.

&gt;1 Because the case is painted silver on the outside, which I now think may
&gt;have helped in over heating it, and also, I think there is too much material
&gt;for it to be regular bearing wear, (I assume).

I'm powdercoating my cases silver. Looks kewl. Overheating comes from
too hot oil. Paint your proper running engine case blue imetalflake if you like.

&gt;but heres a little bit of a kicker, the motor only has about 2000 mi. on it.

Ouch.

&gt;Now, what should I do?

Verify oil pressure, if you dare run it some more.
