All this coming from the people trying to kill the aircooled VW.....And
those promoting it....VWOA gets a thumbs down from me, no matter who they
help......I'm sure it will be a huge tax writeoff for them, don't be fooled,
they are out to help themselves...

You guessed it, these watercooled airheads are not among my favorite group
of people....

Nice effort VWOA, but start helping those who got you to the point you are
now, instead of shutting us down for using your symbols, and you might sell
a few more cars to true VW enthusiast.....

City Fire Department


&gt; Volkswagen of America Donates 25 Eurovans to the New York City Fire
&gt; Department
&gt; September 21, 10:00 - NEWS: Volkswagen of America, Inc. is handing over 25
&gt; new EuroVans to the New York City Fire Department, to help the families of
&gt; the firefighters who lost their lives responding to the terrorist attack
on
&gt; the World Trade Center, as well as to assist the department as it carries
&gt; out its vital day-to-day responsibilities.
&gt;
&gt; Volkswagen will begin loaning the EuroVans, a mid-size van that provides
&gt; abundant space for people and cargo, to the NYC Fire Department beginning
&gt; this weekend. All vans will be specially prepped and equipped by the
&gt; Department's vehicle administration services, with such items as
short-wave
&gt; radios, sirens, and logos.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Volkswagen of America, Inc. was born in Manhattan in the 1950s and we
&gt; continue to feel a strong tie to the Greatest City in the World,&quot; said
Gerd
&gt; Klauss, President and CEO, Volkswagen of America. &quot;We hope this donation
of
&gt; EuroVans helps in some small way to make the lives of the firefighters and
&gt; their families a little easier in this time of great need. This is just
the
&gt; beginning of our company's commitment to help, as Volkswagen AG in Germany
&gt; has committed to the establishment of a Foundation to help victims of this
&gt; senseless violence.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; On Monday, the employees and management of the Volkswagen Group decided to
&gt; create a Foundation to assist victims of terrorist attacks in the United
&gt; States. The Foundation will be funded initially with $2 million dollars
(US)
&gt; from Volkswagen.
&gt;
&gt; The purpose of this Foundation is to extend humanitarian help to the
&gt; children of the families that have been traumatized by last week's
terrorist
&gt; attacks in the United States. This will include medical and psychological
&gt; assistance as well as rehabilitation and scholarships.
&gt;
&gt; And since this isn't a Friday post I am sure that they wanted Splitties
