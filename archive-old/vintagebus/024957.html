the brown wire through the column is brown.(ground is brown)   at the horn 
you have a black/yellow hot wire.    check with you test light that that wire 
is hot.   if no power there- you hav to figure out why.    did you bench test 
the horn?   ok- the brown wire goes from the horn, through the steering 
column, and screws to the horn button.  is you ground the wire against the 
column does it beep?   but not when you press the button?   hm- horn btton 
has corrosion.    I like to use some fine sand paper and clean up wher ethe 
button grounds.  sometimes I have to take the button apart and clean where 
the metal spring contacts, or nag the dimple  out in the bronzey hat thing in 
there.   to  take it apart carefully bend straigh 2 or the 3 tabs on the 
chrome ring, and it will all come apart.
