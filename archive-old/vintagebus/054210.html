Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical help needed no start. ground?


If you don't have a tranny ground strap, you've no real way of grounding
your starter for the high starter current. There are other small paths to
ground from the engine, but none can carry the starter current. 

Get that ground strap on there!

&gt; OK,
&gt; New motor in, ready to go, positive coil side hooked up to 15, checked hot,

&gt; Replaced coil with known good. I did these two things after trying to start
&gt; her with no luck, coil threw a weak spark to engine tin when testing as per
&gt; Muir. My question is, can low spark, no spark be caused by bad ground?
&gt; Dumbass here forgot to by a trans to chassis gorund strap, and I hooked my
&gt; battery ground to body. I will def purchase a ground strap, but am worried
&gt; in the mean I am missing something. Could that be the sorce of difficult to
&gt; diagnose electric ghosts? And a no start? The engine and trans are basically
&gt; completely isolated by new mounts, new engine rubber, etc. I see almost no
&gt; way for engine to get ground at this point, perhaps throught front trans
&gt; mount, but the rubber is probably too thick.
&gt; Frustrated and hoping its something simple as proposed,
