&gt; I was  wondering if anyone can give me advice if a
&gt; shoulder harness can be installed without  messing up the cab.
&gt;
 We have had more than a few customers who wanted us to install 3 point
belts in their buses. It can be done fairly easily but you will
definitely have to do or have some welding done.

You first need to drill a hole that your bolt will go through, in the
pillar behind the door. Then you need to cut open the pillar in a &quot;C&quot;
shape around the hole. It needs to be large enough to weld a large
washer on the back.

You then need to weld your nut to the washer. An easy way to do this is
to insert the bolt from the outside to hold the washer and bolt in place
so you can tack weld them both to the pried open wall.

You then hammer the cut area down and weld it back into place.  Grind
down your weld and you're in business.

Good luck,
Gary
