Subject: Re: [VB] SP heads

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I want to build a 1641 - so I'm about to begin gathering up parts.  I'm
&gt; looking at a pair of heads - what part numbers would be best for my
&gt; purposes?
&gt;
&gt; And what size P and C's would I need?

Save yourself some heartache now, and don't run the thin 87mm cylinders for
a bus motor. They'll wear &quot;egg shaped&quot; prematurley and after about 5000
miles you'll be making less power and more blow-by than a 1600 using 85.5
cylinders.
