 Are the popouts in a '54 barndoor kombi any different than the '55 &amp; up 
 popouts?
  &gt;&gt;
at some point in 54 (I could look it up if you really need it) they changed 
the frame wher ethe pop out latch goes on. The earlier style has two 
horizontally placed screw bits, the later ones are vertically placed.    I 
think i t was in April, offhand.   Same frames were used on eraly doublecabs, 
though the latches were changed (to protect the innocent?)
