The alternative is that you end up with slightly non-round drums, due
to heat-induced warping.  That greatly reduces the effectiveness of
your braking at all times, not just when the drums are hot, since the
warp doesn't go away.  As mentioned elsewhere, it doesn't take much
additional separation for the shoes to not make solid contact.  If
you've ever had &quot;jerky&quot; brakes, you've experienced the problem of
warped drums.  It's quite...intriguing....
