Well, I've got heads on order now so I went and tried to look over the rest
of the engine. Finally after reading the Idiot Book a bit I decided to go
ahead and at least take a good look at the pistons and cylinders. Well,
guess what? First cylinder I take off, I get a broken top piston ring. The
&quot;Book&quot; was right. Sometimes it's not worth doing half a** job cause you
might have to go back at it again very soon. How would I look if I put new
heads on, put the engine in my bus and then had to take it out again to
replace broken ring??? It looks like I'm gonna split the case and start from
scratch. Replace the bearings, weight the pistons and rods and see what else
needs attention. Is there anything in particular I should be looking at?
anything that might need replacing. I want this engine to be good to me for
at least next decade until my son starts driving. Then I'll let him worry
about it.

Thanks

Andre
