Subject: [VB] Jax Beach + diff + hubcap pass at Everybus

The Buses by the Beach show at Jacksonville Beach, FL was a lot of fun last
weekend.  It was the first show that I took a split to.  I would have
brought it to the Southern Poly show last summer, but the generator
literally burnt up a few days before it ^_^  After that it spent several
months in Cleveland getting &quot;fixed.&quot; There were a lot of really nice buses,
I don't think I've ever seen so many nice singles and crews, plus the
Porsche powered bus was a sight to see.  I fell in love with a psyched panel
van owned (I believe) by david_at_bugjunction.  I would have liked to have seen
a few more swap vendors, but I still found a few things I was looking for,
like another &quot;043 A&quot; distributor for the engine I'll put into the Westy, and
a spare electrical portion for the locking steering column (thanks Dave!).
Met a lot of cool people too, like Charlie Ford and Marv.  A lot of nice
buses garnered well deserved awards, and my Kombi won &quot;ugliest&quot; :-)  A few
of us camped out on the site for the next day's all-VW show, surrounded by
teeny-boppers and low-riderz...and then it got COLD!  All in all, a great
show with great people.  Much thanks to the organizers.

I have sitting right here the &quot;baton&quot; for the Great Bus Tour, plus the
accompanying karma kase :-)  The best opportunity for me to pass it off will
be at Everybus as I don't have any other solid plans to attend events yet.
Anybody who will be getting out in a westerly direction want to take
possession next?  Please let me know, I'd hate for it to be stuck in
Dahlonega for who knows how long.  I'll be easy to find at Everybus, look
for a rattle-can blue and white Kombi with a black nose and an enormous
peace sign painted on the roof, plus a gray passenger door.

My Kombi's tranny is making weird noises.  When I turn sharply in either
direction, I get a rattly, grating sound from somewhere in the back.  It
also occurs to a lesser extent when over-running the engine (like going down
a hill with foot off the gas).  It happens in all gears, clutch in or out,
plus neutral, so I suspect the differential?  Plenty of oil in there.  I
guess I shouldn't be surprised, I suspect the tranny was run without oil for
a while.  It pops out of second gear when downshifting at moderate/hi revs,
and fourth gear howls pretty good.  Can I keep driving on this a little
longer, or is there imminent doom?  I have heard these noises during the
trip to FL and around town, but now that I've secured some rattling stuff
and removed some loose items (bumper splash pans) it's pretty noticeable.
What say you?  I've checked for things rubbing, can't find anything.  It
almost sounds like something is broken and rolling around in there.  Unknown
miles on the tranny.
