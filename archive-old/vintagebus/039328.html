I disagree Ken... at an intuitional level it is cheaper to buy the cd and 
then print the whole thing out.  I would not be surprised if you could take 
it to Kinko's and print it and still be less than $100.  I would go for CD 
over hardcopy.

&gt; &gt; i remember that bentley had been putting a bunch of their manuals into 
&gt;pdf
&gt; &gt; format...I would imagine that this would make the production costs
&gt; &gt; cheaper...and therefore our costs less. I know that nothing beats a real 
&gt;book,
&gt; &gt; but for $100?
&gt;
&gt;Kevin, do you own a pre 1963 VW type2 ?
&gt;What type of manual do you use on your vehicles?
&gt;Nothing beats a Bentley. Nothing in english that is...
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't want to use my desk top for roadside repairs.
&gt;or even a fragile three thousand dollar notebook .
&gt;A $100 book is a lot more practical.
&gt;
&gt;To all you guys and gals who have ideas on
&gt;.PDF or CDROM Bentleys;
&gt;Stop thinking  and please sigh the petition.
