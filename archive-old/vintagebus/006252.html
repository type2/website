No, really...I'm not going that fast....since it is a '66, and does have a
sway bar in front, I feel that it does handle pretty good already.  As soon
as the budget permits, I'm off to get me a set of Jupiter 8-ply tires.  I've
got those on my Vanagon, and they rock!  It's all about the sidewall!  But
first I have to decide whether to upgrade to 15&quot; rims or not.  I think my
speedo is off, and the mileage calculations said I'm getting 16.71
mpg....something's not right!

    As far as the rolling sensation goes, I am feeling that part of it is
the tires, but I sense that the camber is a bit much for any tire to have to
put up with.  I'll try one of those things, with new shocks and
tires....we'll see!

&gt; &lt;&lt; I've been driving around unladen, and I take exception to the rolling
&gt; sensation I get when rounding some corners!  &gt;&gt;

you need to slow down or invest in a Porsche or
&gt; Ferrari that has a lower center of gravity.  Eric&amp;Barb
