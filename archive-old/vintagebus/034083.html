Just got home from Costco in Las Vegas (no i didn't gamble) except on
driveing in that city, and they had the 10X20?? (i didn't write it down)
shelters there again. They have a pitched roof and come with side panels
also. The good news, they lowered the price to $150.00 dollars now, I asked
and was told this will be a stocking item through Spring and Summer, the
weird part is they had all Summer stuff out allready,of course it's been in
the high 70's and low 80's around here already..

Also their I found 2 more intereating items, 1 an EZ up style canopy for
only 69.00 dollars, a great item to have for your BUS camping, show and swap
meets, o yea they were 9X9 and set up in 60 seconds.
2. For all you bus campers they had a complete set of cast iron pans 3 with
the lids and it came with the huge dutch oven  all for 39.95, if you haven't
tried it at many a bus camp-outs some of the best food has come out of these
cast iron dutch ovens.

I know this doesn't really have the bus content that is supposed to be here,
and is probaly a Friday thingy, but heck, but for those of us that use our
buses for camping ,these are handy items to have, and they could run out by
the weekend!!!
