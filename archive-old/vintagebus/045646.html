Subject: more finally got a bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Now that you know how I got my bus, I will tell you a little about it. It is 
a '58 standard I think. It has a newly rebuilt '66 tranny 36 hp motor with a 
12V porsche generator. All the engine tin and heater boxes are there. All the 
parts that he promised were inside were not there, but it did come with both 
bumpers, the original front bench seat that is thrashed, and some camper 
interior. He told me it had an ignition, but it doesn't have a key, and it is 
also missing a turnsignal switch, any interior, 2 popouts, a gas cap,  and 
the rear hatch.  It has the original glass taillights and all the doors are 
fina and work. NOne of the other glass is cracked, and best of all, there is 
NO RUST anywhere. It even has the cargo mat in back. None of the mechanicals 
are hooked up, but I took it to my mechanic and he said he will can get it 
running and &quot;dialed in&quot; for about $100. I dod not have it done yet though 
because I want to start buying parts for it first. 
It needs:all the interior
    all the bulbs
    all the knobs
    an ignition, or a key made for the one it has
    a gas cap
    tires
    2 rims, came with 6, but 4 are for bugs
    drivers side outside door handle
    a rear hatch
    2 popouts
    and probably all new rubber

The body is very straight, but it has some bondo on driver's side panel. 
I will have many Q's once I start working on it more, but for now, how do I 
ID it, What I mean is where are the numbers? I am embarrassed to ask because 
you have answered this so many times, but I never paid attention since I 
didn't heve a bus.

What I want to know is, were all Westies pop-tops. I ask because it came with 
a sink, a single chair with a dawer underneath, and a bench seat with a 
backrest that has handles behind it. The guy told me that they were just in 
there when he got it, but the upholstery on the chair, bench,  and backrest 
matches the front bench seat. Then I saw that very little of the vinyl left 
on the dividing wall was the same color also. I always wanted a westy, and 
think I am reaching in thinking that this might have been one, but how could 
I know for sure???
