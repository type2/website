Subject: shifter adjustment

My '59 Kombi has trouble going into second. It'll grind unless I 
really baby it and shift just right. Also, I occasionally end up 
finding a mystery spot when trying to go into reverse. It does 
nothing but go RRRRRRR.

An old VW guy told me I more than likely just need to adjust the 
shifter up in the cab. The plate around it I think he said. He told 
me they get worn and can be adjusted...and that many times people 
replace their tranny when all it was was the shifter plate or 
whatever.

Has anyone done this? The Bentley basically says to adjust it until 
it shifts into all the gears correctly. But wouldn't you have to 
drive it after every little adjustment to see if you got it right? Is 
there some kind of rhyme or reason to doing this?

Any input would be appreciated.
