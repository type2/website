&gt; Eric,
&gt; What is the highest outdoor temperature you can continously floor your bus
at ?
&gt; For me above 75 degrees, flooring for more than a couple seconds is
&gt; punished by hot oil.

115 to 120 degrees while I lived in Las Vegas. Living there is where I did a
majority of my testing and modifications.

&gt; Following what seems to be majority advice here is southern california
&gt; I run straight WT40 oil. Can you explain why it does not do a good job
&gt; at cooling compared to 5w30 ? I used 20W50 before and belive that oil
&gt; was staying cooler.

The theory I go by with my motors is that lubrication is based on oil flow,
not oil pressure. The more pressure you have, the more oil is going past the
pressure relief valve, and less is being supplied to the bearings. As long
as I can maintain 10psi per 1000rpm, I don't run oil thicker than that. And
if you keep your engine cool, you don't need really thick oil to begin with.
&gt;
&gt; On my way to Joshua Tree I did the engine compartment pressure test.
&gt; With the early bay the compartment is pressurized at 55mph and 60mph
&gt; on fourth. Uphill on third at 40 it is vacuum. Never big differences
&gt; though, at most half inch of water.

Not much room in a bay engine bay, but i've thought about how nice it would
be to have an automatic &quot;trap door&quot; open for added intake area for the
engine bay when driven at highrpm/low speed to eliminate the engine bay
vacuum in those circumstances. No good place to do it on my bus though.
Plus, I don't know how I would wire something like that up. It would have to
close back up when engine speed picked up.
