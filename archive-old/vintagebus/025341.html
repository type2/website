Congratulations Bill; let's see...ruined clothes, cursing, primal
screams...sounds like another day at the office, I thought we bought busses to
get away from all that.
Come on over tomorrow if you want a lesson in &quot;Our Friend the Brake System&quot;.
Clara, Eric&amp;Barb Woody4 plus other list friends have all given me assignments to
complete, and barring rain, tomorrows the day. I'll be doing this instead of
Effingham.
