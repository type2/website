I would thinkyou could rethread this no problem, but I have not doen it
myself.

The screw that held the handle in on my bus ('65 kombi) would always loosen up
when I was driving around. Finally I came across this tip in a book-wrap the
screw or bolt in teflon tape(the stuff you use to help seal pipe connections).
Anyway that worked great for mine.

good luck
