[7:00pm Friday] I called Daniel and he said Oval's is pulling the engine now
to look at the oil cooler and trying to find the current cause.

I offered to drive him or help him in any way, he has my home number (425)
235-9168.

If Oval's made any mistakes, I expect they will correct it.  I sure hope
they stay late tonight and Saturday if needed and don't make him wait until
Monday :)

1600 engine


Last Friday a couple of us in the Tacoma/Puyallup area got called by the
owner of a Westy whose engine had crapped out big time on I-5 near Federal
Way, Washington.  He's traveling the West from his base in New Orleans, and
got our names from the AIRS site.
[snip]

The owner of this bus, Daniel Winkert, has now been stuck for a full week.
He's obviously anxious to return to his home in New Orleans, preferably at
the wheel of his bus.  If anyone out there has some ideas or insights we
[and the Oval's crew] have somehow overlooked please respond ASAP.  Dan has
no e-mail or 'net access, so I'm the contact person.  He can be reached
directly by cell phone at: (504) 296-6652.  Ironically, many of the List
experts are in the Seattle area for this weekend's Vintage Classic events,
and have driven unaware within a few hundred yards of where Dan and his sick
bus are located.
