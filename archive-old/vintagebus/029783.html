Stainless steal brake lines! I know some will argue the burst factor but I cannot picture
these not being way stronger than stock. I used them on a old tricked out Scirocco I had and
it was a huge difference. I also had them on the front of my 57 Deluxe, that was great. I just
replaced all of the hoses on my 60 Double Cab and wow. I can actually skid! I bought mine from
Rocky Mountain Motorworks. I do like the disk brake idea eventually though.
