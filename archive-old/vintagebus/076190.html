Subject: Lincoln Welders and Lowe's

Greasy Volks,

Last year, before my son and I bought our MIG, we looked around and saw
two models of Lincoln's, nearly identical, except that one model was
about $75 cheaper than the other, closely related model at U.S Welding. 
I called Lincoln about it, and they told me the model at Lowe's was a
lighter, &quot;hobbyist&quot; version of the more industrial model for sale at the
welding shop.  

We later wound up buying a Miller--with an Argon tank.
