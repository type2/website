&lt;&lt; my radio is a 54 model, the &quot;screw terminals&quot; are inside the boxes 
themselves.they are a series of tabs to sort of &quot;rewire&quot; move them to 
different contacts as the pattern shows. are we talking about the same 
thing?&gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Pretty much the same thing.

&lt;&lt; one other person mentioned a switch on the back side, mines not like that. 
which way is you BP? thanks  &gt;&gt;
We have ones that have a tab that has prongs on it.  To switch voltages you 
remove the tab (Round or rectangle.) and reverse it in it's place to get what 
you want.  Others have switches, some have popsicle stick shaped devices that 
you pull out, flip, reinsert to make the proper connections inside with the 
copper stripes on the stick.
