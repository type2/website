Hi all,
This is my first post to the t-2 list. I was on the
vintagevw list a while back while involved with restoring
our 62 bug. The reason for getting
on this list is that my wife and I just took delivery
of an all original 62 SO-34 Westy with the flip seat. We found
it while on a bike ride about 2 miles from our house.
It's an amazing feat of engineering. So many things to
swing, switch, pop, flip, spin and open. I love gadgets so this is the
perfect toy for me. It was originally sold in Germany, toured
Europe for a short time, then was shipped to New York. It made
its way to California where it was promptly sold. It was bought by
an older couple and over the years ran the odometer up to only 34k. Am told
that the original 1200 motor was traded for a new 1500 when they came
out in 63. When the owners passed away it was inherited by the kids and
that's
who we got it from after it sat for around 15 years. The &quot;kids&quot; (who are now
in their late
fifties) put about $2k into the it back in 95 including completely redone
brakes, clutch,
steering components and other mechanicals, so It's very driveable.
Could use a paint job but the interior is beautiful. Original upholstery in
great
shape. Front seat tastefully redone. Square weave carpet still there.
It's almost got everything  Westfalia put in it.
Rack in perfect condition, two immaculate tents, chemical toilet with 11 out
of 12 original
cans of chemical! 3 out of 6 aluminum cups. Hanging light, fan, 2 folding
metal chairs
with matching upholstery. 3 water jugs. Cool emergency light that plugs into
the
accessory jack for some nighttime roadside repairs. Eberspacher (sp?) heater
factory
installed. Dining table and a child's sleeping cot that hooks up over the
front bench seat.
2 extra sets of unused curtains. They really took good care of this bus.
It does have a little rust under the front windows and on the bottoms of the
front doors. Floors are solid. All the seals are dried up. A little surface
rust around
some of the bad door seals. Body is very straight with only a couple of
dings here and there. We plan
on a very conservative restoration for her. The seller had the shipping
documents
from Bremerhaven to New York along with the receipt for the extra curtains
from Westfalia-Werke K.-G.
Needless to say were extremely happy with our purchase.
And without any further ado... the first question.
Does anyone know how to operate the
gas heater mentioned above? there's a little knob under the drivers seat and
what looks like a tiny red light. I'm guessing this the heater control.
Also, I'm having a little starting her up.
The battery says it's putting out 6v. I cleaned the battery terminals and
the ground connection.
Also cleaned up the connections at the starter, but it turns over slow and
sometimes just stops
turning the engine. After it starts it runs great. I noticed that the lead
to the starter has got
juice even when the key is in the off position. Is this normal?
I hope to get this taken care of in time for the Split Bus camp out at
Fort Bragg!!
Thanks for any suggestions.

Larry
