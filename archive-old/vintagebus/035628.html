&gt;  But, then again, there are people on this list that put creative
&gt;  engineering safaris in their bus, keep the tempered glass, and drive it.
&gt;  I'd say that shows a complete lack of brains, but thats me. There is a
&gt;  RESAON that no new cars have tempered windshields, they are a dumb idea.
&gt;  


My situation in the other way around- to drive the 61 in comfort in rainy 
times, I have removed the original safaris and installed a tempered 
windsheilds, which I can remove the next summer and reuse both seal and glass.

The 53 has tempered windsheilds in it- with 48 year old weatherstrips.

who had the 189 dollar glass?   Real dealer splitty windsheild?  

FWIW glass you get cut at a glass shop is a different thickness that original 
bus glass, and the people who cut it- always a tad off, is harder to fit than 
original stuff.  Local glass shop quoted me the other day $65 a side.  Ouch.  
That guy was on crank too.  twitch twitch tweaker.   And said flat glass is 
really expensive. 

 Original genuine parts are nicer.   Using molded genuine VW window seals is 
so much nicer than the repros.
