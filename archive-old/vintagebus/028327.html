 We have been known as the *VOLVO* people by many very nice folks at our
first show BBBIV.  This was our first VW bus event, with an interest in
adopting a bus in the near future.  Well as many friendly vw bus types know
it was not very long, and now we are &quot;59 DDr w/t with a 65 ez camper&quot;.  We do
enjoy the friends and faces at many of the events, shows, on line and the
homes of other vw enthusiasts which have provided many answers to our
countless vw questions.  We did drive it home  (50 miles) and to our first
meet  (100 miles one way) with the bus but did learn how much was needed to
be done to make it road worthy.  We have done much to the bus and have driven
it to several shows including Kelly park (500 miles one way)  (lots to see
and buy WOW!!).  This is a lot of story to say we do use the bus a lot BUT we
do go to  events in the our Volvo, because some times that is the way it
works out But we do go and enjoy the vw bus thing.

&gt; hit the freeking road! What are you some kind of guy
&gt; who shows up to bus events in a *VOLVO* ? Sleep in the
&gt; bus even if it means sleeping up right.
