&gt; Can I weld up the oversize spring plate to redux box bolt holes myself
&gt; or does that require special techniques or equipment?

Hi Joel,
Yes you can as long as you are carefully not to heat the swing plate up too 
much.  If the hole is just a small amount bigger then a washer should spread 
the pressure out and over the spring plate properly.
