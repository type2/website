&gt;&gt; Why does Everett's page load 10 times faster than Thom's.  I look at
them at home (28.8 ughh!) and from work (T1) and its the same from both
places, although the T1 is naturally faster than my dial up, Everett's site
is signifiacantly faster than Thom's.
&gt;&gt;  
I'm assuming you mean the main page?

According to http://websitegarage_dot_netscape_dot_com/ (neutral 3rd party) vintagebus_dot_com
is faster, although we both have crappy load times according to them.  It
said vintagebus_dot_com had more &quot;HTML errors,&quot; I don't know if that slows down
a browser or not.

On a basic level, vintagebus_dot_com will load faster because it has less to
load on the main page - I have 1 more frame, more little icons, etc..

Anyway, network traffic can vary widely, after repeated cache clears, it
took from 2-30 seconds to do thesamba_dot_com/vw (froze on the top factoid)
and from 2 sec-1 min to do vintagebus_dot_com (froze on the menu).  This is
my work where I think we have a bunch of T1s.  

I have had people tell me my site is real fast compared to others, no direct
comparisons were made.

My site runs out of San Diego but proximity across CA should not be a variable.
