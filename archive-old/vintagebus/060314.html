Subject: custom cabinet -

So I have this Science and Mechanics magazine from October 1958 (I think =
that this magazine eventually became Popular Mechanics).  In this =
magazine there is a test drive report on &quot;Volkswagen's Unique Station =
Wagon - Bus.&quot;  At the end of the test drive there is a mention of the =
&quot;V-1 Camper Unit&quot; made by Saxe and Co. 915 West Olive Ave., Burbank =
Calif.  This Camper Unit was a cabinet that slide in behind the =
bulkhead.  It had an ice box, a gas stove, and drawers etc.  and sold =
for $495.00.  From the picture it looks to be about 30 inches deep and =
of course as wide as the buss and as tall has the bulkhead.  There were =
two stretchers that some how look to be either suspended from the =
ceiling or maybe resting on the backs of the seats (this is a 23 window =
delux in the picture.

Anyway - I would like to build or have built a unit like this.  Ideally, =
I could find one to recondition (good luck), or to get measurements from =
(good luck), but likely I'll just have to take measurements and get one =
made.  I have a full-width z-bed in my 60 standard so a unit like this =
that pops in and pops out would be ... perfect.

Anyone have any ideas?  Does anyone know of a place that makes cabinets =
for campers or R.V.s?

TIA
