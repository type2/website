I wear gloves, hat, scarf, coat, in the middle of March. Needs Eberspacher,
will try to fix and install it soon. The new antenna gives great radio
reception, but sometimes I just like to listen to the bus. The headlights are
bright, the horn is loud, the brakes stop it well, and the motors purrs. Why
drive anything but a splitty?
