Subject: steering box ???

i just tore into a splitty steering box yesterday. there was about 2mm
in/out freeplay of the pitman arm shaft (in bentley--lever shaft) that was
non-adjustable with the set screw. after getting everything apart and
checking all surfaces for wear, pitting, signs of siezing, etc.., i noticed
nothing that seemed worn at all. everything looked good, and nothing was
trashed, bearings all good/free, and hardly any signs of use out of the
ordinary.
my question is: what wears inside the boxes to cause the in/out freeplay?
is it the tapered pin end that rides in the groove of the steering shaft? i
guess it could, but it's supported by a double-taper-roller-bearing which
allows it to roll rather than being a fixed point.
i know the bushings could wear, but there was no noticeable wiggle in the
lever shaft, and barely any wear on the shaft itself.
what actually gets &quot;rebuilt&quot; when a unit is sent to a shop for &quot;rebuilding&quot;?
