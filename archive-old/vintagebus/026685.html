Subject: RE: Flasher Relay

[...]   Anyone have a source for these?

I think the wiring for the turn signal lever control &amp; lights is
a lot different on a '67; Ronnie at www.type2parts_dot_com has a replacement
relay and can probably tell you more..

Hi,
I just did this in my 65 a couple months ago.  I spent lots of time
looking for a good black box and finally just got the repalcement one
that KYMCO makes.  It works fine and I didn't have to modify my wiring
too much.  I just got a diagram and wired it like a 67, I left all the
original wires in place and just added new ones where I needed to.  Be
sure to get the extra diode that they  have for this kit, without it
your flashers won't work right at all, trust me.
    I'm not very skilled in electrical stuff,  but I think you could
make this kit yourself at radio shack for cheaper than it costs from
kymco, just a thought.

Good luck!
Jon
