Wow !!!! Hot!!!!! ......When I got my Bus it had and
still does one of those external oil coolers installed
in the engine compartment....Not a good idea I hear
but...I hooked up a small fan with a off/on switch up
front by the drivers wheel.The fan sucks air in from
the rear left side openings and then over the oil
cooler hanging from that metal seam,secured top and
bottom.If I can believe the temp gauge at that time
...years ago.I was running in a outside air temp in
the high desert of about 115 or more....and the oil
temp dropped at least 20 degrees in short order when I
turned that fan on !! I live on the calif coast so not
much need for that now......Later....Mark 67 Deluxe
