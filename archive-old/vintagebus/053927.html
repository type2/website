Subject: RE: [VB] cb performance sump filter

  I have installed this sump filter in over 10 engines and use these instead
of filter pumps and/or full flow when the situation calls for it. So far the
highest mileage engine with one (that I built) in it is 45,000 miles, most L
A freeway miles. 
  My old 62 panel with a 1776 in it also had one on it, I sold this bus with
approx 24,000 on the engine 3 years ago and have seen the bus for sale in
Utah in the past few months. At the Karls Custom show last weekend I talked
to a guy who test drove it and he said it still runs like a top, but I have
no idea how many miles are on it now.
  I also have one of these on my wife's 65 b#g daily driver, It was
installed on a NEW Mexican 1600.

Subject: [VB] cb performance sump filter


just saw this in vwtrends... a paper filter that replaces the mesh one in
the oil sump. any thoughts on this? my first thought is restricting the
suction side of the pump is a no-no, but maybe other motors do this w/ no
probs.

also, i wonder why vw didn't do this - before they went to full-flow, that
is.
