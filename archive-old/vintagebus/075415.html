Subject: Re: [VB] San Jose FLAPS? 12V starter motor needed!

Clara,

I've had a new/reburbished FW sitting in my room staring at me for 5
months now - guess it's time for starter/FW work in the driveway! ;-)
There's no more excuse for not getting that FW off of the floor and into
the bus! How convenient - and a month before the rainy season! ;-)

&gt; Oh, this happened in my bug once.    You may think about pulling the motor and seeing how chewed up the FW teeth are, maybe replace FW.  ya, check yr FW.
