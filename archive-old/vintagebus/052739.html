Subject: CB Radio antenna

Happy Friday everyone,
Some of you must be using CB radios in your busses. What kind of
antenna did you end up using, and where did you put it? I want the
radio for local traffic info, summoning help in an emergency, maybe
the occasional convoy. I don't need to be able to talk to folks in New
Zealand, but I do travel in some remote US locations, mountains,
deserts and the like, and I'd like to be able to call for help from
there. Any suggestions before I buy the wrong one?
Thanks,
Joel
