Jeez guys - why fool around?

If you really enjoy the challenge of 6 volt electronics (I do!) and want to
protect your ride---

get another battery!

Carry the damn thing with you like you would any other spare parts.  Can be
connected or just along for the ride.

My bug has two hooked up together for extra umph - I don't have to find
hills or tow start, neither of which is all that safe.

So, if you want to keep it stock and not burn anything up, pack a spare. 
$30-40 bucks plus core.

Have I missed anything?  Sheese what a chatty bunch! :)
