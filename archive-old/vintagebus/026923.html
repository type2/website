Subject: Frontend and Disc brakes?

Hi Everyone here is my question again. On my 65 deluxe I have a late
model front beam which has the disc brakes. The previous owner guessed
that was the way to go especially when he needed to slow down on the
autobahn.Is there anyway to find out what year front beam I have so I
can get the correct replacement disc brake parts? Or  is there a way to
tell what year my brake calipers and rotors are?
Thanks in advance.
Bryan
