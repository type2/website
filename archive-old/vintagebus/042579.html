&gt; But, for the same price as regular Bondo, you can go to a good auto body

I have not found the fiberglass bondo to be much use for a finish skim,
all the hairs make it spread like a haystack and i cant get it smooth, i
end up putting a skim of regular bondo over the top of it.

What i plan to use is a filler called all-metal (on a good bus, bondo is
fine for a beater) What it is:

Aluminum dust suspended in polyester resin.  This is good because the
aluminum dust wont soak up water laike the stuff in bondo will, so you
wont end up with a bondo plug full of water to rustthe metal under your
new paint job... and it spreads and shapes as well as bondo, unlike the
fiberglass stuff.

But i still will use the fiberglass stuff where reinforcing is neccecary,
but that should only be on a beater, as the rust holes on a nice bus will
have metal welded in ;)

take care,

Steve
