Subject: PNW shows this weekend

help!  i am considering drivin 900 miles each way this weekend to seattle,
but i am getting conflicting info.
what shows are on saturday?  i see there is the vintage meet and some
drag-race type show in bremerton(?) listed on saturday.  this seems unusual
to have 2 shows in the same area on the same day. then sunday the other
drag-race type show at SIR.
i know this has been discussed a bit in the past, but i'd really like to
know, so i don't show up at the wrong place at the wrong time. help!
