&gt;&gt; I've run a 28 pict on a 1600 sp in a bus, and liked it.
&gt;&gt;  My first bus has one, and it got 31 mpg regularly.
&gt;
&gt; Is this for real?

It doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.  Some numbers are at
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/specs.htm .

&gt; was it an empty bus?

Later, Clara said it was a panel with a home-made bed welded in.  Per
the Web page above, it would have weighed in somewhere around 2500
pounds.

&gt; I am glad when I get 21 on long trips, and get 15 or so around town .

If you're talking about a '71 Westy, that page says it would weigh in
somewhere around 3200 pounds.  If everything else was equal (which it
isn't), if you put Clara's set-up on your Bus, you might expect
(2500/3200)*31 or 24 mpg out of your Bus.  I don't think what you're
getting is too far out of line.

Here are some numbers from VW.  These are all according to DIN 70 030,
which is: measured consumption plus 10% at half maximum load, constant
3/4 of maximum speed, and a level road.

          1200, 28 PICT, starting 1964: 25 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 28 PICT, 3/4 ton, starting 1964: 25 mpg    (Bentley)
   1500, 28 PICT, 1 ton, starting 1964: 24 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 30 PICT-1, 1 ton, starting 1966: 24 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 42 and 44 bhp DIN, through 1967: 22 mpg    (1969 WoG)
            1600, 34 PICT-3, 1971 only: 22.4 mpg  (1972 WoG)
      1700, 34 PDSIT-2/3, through 1972: 18.2 mpg  (1972 WoG)

&quot;WoG&quot; are the &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manuals at the doc project:
http://www.failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ .  &quot;Bentley&quot; is the '63-'67 Bentley;
the bay Bentley doesn't seem to give mileage numbers.

Some numbers from the US EPA.  These are most likely on the &quot;FTP 75&quot;
(aka &quot;EPA III&quot;) drive cycle.  The city cycle is about 11 miles of stop-
and-go driving, max speed about 57 mph, average about 21 mph.  The
highway cycles is about 10 miles of highway driving, max speed about
60 mph, average about 48 mph.

20 (17/25) means 20 mpg combined, 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway.  For 1979
only the combined figure is given.

2000, fuel injection, manual, 1978: 20 (17/25) mpg, 50-state  (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1978: 19 (17/23) mpg, 50-state (US EPA)
2000, fuel injection, manual, 1979: 17, 50-state (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1979: 15, 49-state (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1979: 16, California (US EPA)

Your mileage may vary.

PS: Bonus geek point - why do some of the lines in the 1978-1993 EPA fuel
economy guides have funny characters at the far left?
