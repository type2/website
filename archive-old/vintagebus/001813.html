Now I know it's not completely a Bus topic but I have seen a game some time
ago, a Play Station game that featured various Volkswagens off-roading. I
remember someone has mentioned this game here. My son is dying for it and I
can't find the darn thing. Can someone put a smile on his face? Just let me
know what the title of it was and where I can still find it.
P-mail me, thanks.
