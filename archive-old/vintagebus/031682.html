I do have access to these engines, even though I have never used one
personally. As for installation in a Bus, I have no comments. These are the
same engine that is installed in the Old Beetle in Mexico. You would have to
purchase a Brain, fuel pump, install a return fuel line, etc. Last time I
checked they were $2400.00 dollars plus freight for the long block only.
These are imported in Cali, so shipping would be from there if they have any
left. If you go to the Classic the importer will be there and should have 1
on display and they could give you the name of a local dealer.

heater boxes and a alternator.

[...]

On Feb. 27, 2001 Bob Wallace in the UK mentioned [see below] new 1600 FI
engines.

Has anyone had personal experience with installing one of these as a
replacement for a 1600DP engine in a Transporter/bus/camper?

Do they come as a turnkey setup with FI and associated equipment
included/installed?  If so, what is the cost for such an engine?

Are these engines available anywhere besides the UK?  If so, where?

Thanks for any information you can offer.....

UK.  &lt;&lt;
