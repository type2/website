&gt; I don't have numbers, but you can measure engine bay vacuum VERY easily with a
&gt; length of clear aquarium airline tubing and a glass of water while driving
&gt; down the road. The amount of vacuum can be an incredible amount. Do it
&gt; yourself and you'll see.

Remember here that the differential you are are measuring is between the
interior of the bus and the engine bay.  Depending upon the position of
the vents/windows/etc. the interior might be pressurized compared to the
outside air.  Daniel Bernoulli and all that...

Also, a water manometer is very sensitive as 1 foot of water is equal to
roughly 1/2 PSI.  I wouldn't expect to see too much vacuum, as even one
PSI would cause a force of thousands of pounds on the engine bay sheet
metal!  Never heard of a bus imploding!
