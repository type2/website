Subject: Re: [VB] busted igntion switch?

[...]

&gt; in my flurry to clean up an ignition switch out of a 65 bus (snap of style
&gt; terminals) i accidentally bent one of the copper (?) terminals on the back
&gt; of the switch and it broke off. is there any way to repair this? the
&gt; terminal appears to be rivetted to the ignition switch , so dunno if there
&gt; is anyway to make a workable solution. the switch itself appears to be a
&gt; sealed unit which does not lend itself to being taken apart.
&gt;
&gt; help! :)

Remove the tumbler by removing the clip on the center pin.
Buy a new ignition switch from any vendor of your choice.
Remove the tumbler and toss it.
Stick in your old tumbler.
Toss the old broken switch.
Only difference will be the position of the key. It will be turned about 20
degrees farther then the old switch. But you have a brand new switch....
