 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;once again all german wheel cylinders are shipped with bleeders
......only the brazilian, mexican and indian do not come with bleeders
      for the 64-67 front type 2's, the earlier are only avaiable in
german
exp.  i have both in aTe and fag (55-62) i would list the part numbers
but
  i can't remember them all but heres an example 211 611 047  german
                                                 211 611 047BR brazil
&gt;                                                211 611 047EC india or
asian
                                                 211 611 047MX  mexico
this is how most of the warehouses i purchase from list them so i know
country of origin, this is common with most driveline
(undercarriage)parts
 
on my on line catalog when done All parts i sell will have a country of
origin
code so you will know where your part is from or you can request the
part
from the country of choice, prices very drasticly from country to
country
thats why when i quote against i always will ask what country the parts
you were quoted on are from so i can quote like for like

i hope this info helps some of you

&gt; all ATE and FAG (german) wheel cylinders come with bleeders
&gt; 
&gt; just my experiance
&gt; ps, checked stock and all my german had bleeders
&gt; all except 64-67 front imported didn't( mexico and brazil)
&gt; all other wheel cylinders had them
&gt; conclusion 64-67 bus front imported only,no bleeders
&gt; - - - - - - - 
&gt; yes, I have noticed rears come with bleeders, but front dont.
&gt; 
&gt; well, in the rear there is one cylinder, and it should have a bleeder
on it.
&gt; 
&gt; In the front there are two cylinders per wheel (3/55-67) and only one
has a 
&gt; bleeder, the last in line.   So I suppose they must be acquired
separately, 
&gt; not supplied with as they would only be needed for half of the wheel 
&gt; cylinders.
