&gt;I read your essay on installing an auxillary battery in a bus and I wanted
your opinion.  I would like to be able to plug in a 1200 watt electric
heater in my 74 bus.  Is an auxillary battery the way to go?&lt;

Jessie,
        I wouldnt recommend an electric heater or any other major 12 volt
power consumer for your bus.  Gas heat is the way to go.  What I did was go
to Walmart and get one of those screw on single dish type radiating
adapters for the small propane containers.  I think I paid under $15.  Not
only do I use it while camping but also just on the way to work in the
bitter Winter time.  Works great.  It heats the bus up faster than the
wifey's F$RD.  How many T2'ers out there can say that they wouldnt be so
proud to have their SO ask to sit in your bus until their car warms up?

        I use an auxillary battery only for low voltage accessory items. 
Primarily a small 12v fan for comfortable night time sleeping.  A loud fan
is nice for drowning out the beating drums.  I usually carry a 12v voltage
inverter that I plug a 110v drop light into for setting up camp and (God
forbid) repair during night time.  I also carry along a small, cheap boom
box that I can plug in the the extension part of the drop light for tunes
rather than running the bus's primary battery and radio.  The inverter also
comes in handy for recharging video camera, cell phone, vcr, and
miscellaneous other low voltage 110 volt applications.

        Be aware of high voltage 12v items.  I have seen people carry 12v
electric blankets, 12v electric ovens, 12v hair dryers...and constantly
have dead batteries and are burning stuff up....not good.  Remember to use
fuses in all of your accessories as sleeping in (or worrying about)  a bed
of fire is not the way to go.

        A note on voltage isolators:  They work fine for a short while of
time, but they do burn out.  Many listees argue that the relay style of
isolating voltage is much better.  I choose to replace my cheap ($20)
JCWhip isolator as I like to keep things simple.  I got almost two years
out of my last one.
