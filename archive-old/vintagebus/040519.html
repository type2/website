There is a guy with a '58 SC in my local VW club that replaced all the wood 
slats in the bed, but instead of drilling holes thru the wood slats and 
running screws down thru them into the bed, he ran the screws up from the 
underside of the bed, into the wood strips.  No holes in the wood slats.  
The final effect is pretty nice looking, but given the chance, he doubts he 
would do it again if he had to.  Way too much work.

Anyway,

Mike A.
'64 SO-35

&gt;Personally, I wouldnt use white oak unless its a garage kept beast. I
&gt;would use mahoghany, which is expensive, but u really shouldnt need that
&gt;much. It will hold up real well outside. The key to it lasting will be
&gt;in the finish. I would not recommend polyuerathane. I would use good old
&gt;fashioned spar varnish, but make sure it has uv inhibitors. Too, will
&gt;want to sand the wood to 80 grit and no finer. The deep scratches
&gt;actually help the varnish adhere. You will need many many coats. I dont
&gt;remember the number but it is something like 20 coats!! The reason is,
&gt;if u don't use that many, the uvs will get down to the bottom layer and
&gt;cause it to come loose.
