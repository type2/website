&lt;&lt; Howdy all,
 
 I recently bought an &quot;in-the-box&quot; NOS accessory steering column lock for an
 early Type 1.  With the recent discussion about steering locks, I realized
 that the only thing missing from my lock set was any kind of installation
 or instruction sheet.  Does anybody out there have in their literature or
 parts collections, the instruction sheet(s) from either (or both!!!) the
 Type 2 or Type 1 accessory steering column lock.  If so, could I get you to
 make a nice photocopy of what you have and send it along to me so I'll know
 how to install this particular set on my '57 Cabriolet.  I'll also be
 hunting this season for one for my '59 Double Cab, so both Types of
 instructions would be very helpful.  I'd be delighted to reimburse your
 expenses.  Please e-mail me personally if you can help me out.  Thanks for
 looking!
