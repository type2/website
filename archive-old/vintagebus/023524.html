Subject: Tekno Barndoor Toy Pics
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I went to an antique show today at the Cow Palace in San Francisco and I 
found a Tekno Bus_toy
I believe that it truly is a barndoor not a splitty, by tyhe large rear engie 
hatch and the lack of eyebrow. The rear seems a little bit tucked in too 
much, so I am puzzled.
I have taken PICS and put them on my website
the URL is

If anyone knows about this toy and exactly what model Bdoor it is I would 
appreciate any info.
