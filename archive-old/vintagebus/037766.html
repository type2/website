Here are some recent quotes regarding my Bus from fellow workers, people on the street, the OCTO show, etc..

Fellow workers or man on the street:
&quot;Why are you driving that thing?&quot;
&quot;When are you getting it painted?&quot; (asked every other day to bug me :)
&quot;So when are you getting a car with a/c?&quot;
&quot;Someone's going to hit you pretty soon.&quot;
&quot;That car is too rare to drive&quot;
&quot;Is this a 21-window?&quot;  (I have a Kombi)
&quot;36hp? Hahahahaha!&quot;

People at OCTO:
&quot;Those tires are huge!&quot;  (6.50x16 bias plys)
&quot;Is this a Barndoor? 53 or earlier, right?&quot;
&quot;'55?  Did they make Volkswagens back then?&quot;
&quot;Wow, you could sleep in there!&quot;  (regarding the engine compartment)
