&gt;     Also I run my 64 with the Sway Away brand front anti sway bar and the rear
&gt; camber compensator, and I love it!!!
&gt; It makes the bus much safer and more responsive in the turns and in the high

Woody was so kind as to let me drive this beautiful bus of his. I didn't drive it
for miles and miles...but what I did drive it..I noticed an incredible difference
in stability.  It felt a LOT better than my bay window even.  I am seriousely
considering putting one on my split.  He took corners that had me hanging onto the
oh sh*t handle and hanging out the window, and the bus was very very stable.
Woody, where can I get something like this again? you told me once..but I forgot.

but really folks....put serious consideration into something like this...anti sway
bars work wonders.
