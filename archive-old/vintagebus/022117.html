&gt;Yeah, but at the swap meet, no one walks up during the last seconds of a
&gt;transaction and snatches it out of your hand then gives the guy a buck more.
&gt;Right?

But in an auction, there is no &quot;transaction&quot; until the last swing of the 
gavel.  That last swing is the instant the auction is over, and all bids 
are accepted until then.

As a side note, there have been a few auctions where I was bidding against 
list members &amp; I recognized their names and emailed them to see how bad 
they wanted the item.  If they were going to have a final bid higher than 
my final bid, then I did not drive the final price up.

Thom &amp; I did this for each other a couple of times and I think we both 
benefitted from it.

I often bid on literature &amp; am amazed at how much higher the prices go than 
you can get the same piece at a show for.  I usually bid $5 less than what 
I could get the piece at a show.  I have only won a couple of times...

Don't you guys have literature sales guys at the shows you go to?  Stuff 
that goes for $30-40 at shows I have seen listmembers bid $70-80 for!
