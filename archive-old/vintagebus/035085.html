I need to get a more complete shop manual for my 61 doublecab. I have
read about the Bentley manual and that sounds like the one for me.
Problem is that I can only find it for post '63 buses. Is there an
edition for the earlier buses and if so where is the cheapest place to
get it from?

Next question: if there isn't a Bentley for the earlier buses can anyone
recomend a good alternative other than the Idiot's Guide? I found the
Idiot's book useful but not nearly specific bus enough.

Bentley reprinted the 63 edition of the VW transporter workshop manual, which
covers 63-67 buses.     Thereis a 59 edition, covers 59 through 62, which
perhaps you can find in the original.      But the 63 edition covers quite a
lot for your 61-  front and rear suspension, brakes,   all kinds of neat
things like how the cab door window frames come apart.   The body section is
pretty cool.   Get it.
