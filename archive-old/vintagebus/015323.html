Hello all,

the type 2 Bus list (bay windows), but I am not
on that list and don't want to have to subscribe
for one or two questions. If you would not mind
coould someone please E-mil me and I will send
the question and have you post it? I used to be a
listee, but sold all of my Baywindows and am not
looking at another. Thanks
