It's Friday! 

When I first began working on the '65 DC I discoverd sand in numerous places, the fresh air vent, inside what was left of the inner rockers, etc. which led me to the brilliant conclusion that the P.O. had sandblasted it at one time.

While cruising at a beautiful 55 mph last night on my way to the driving range to hit a bucket of balls, I noticed sand coming out of the heater vents under the windshields.  Not a lot, but enough to put a fine coating of sand all over the dash.  Damn it!  I checked the cargo area and sure enough there was a little on the rear floor that had come out of the rear heater vent.

Any suggestions on the best way to blow this stuff out, for good.  If I stick an air hose in the rear at the heater tube connection, I'm going to dust the bus.  Trying to blow from the heater vents backwards won't be as effective, will it?  Or maybe it will, I'll have gravity on my side. I suppose I could fit a small tube on the air hose and feed it down into the heating vents.

The good news is I'm pulling the motor in a week or two to install my fresh rebuilt tranny, with the 3.88 r &amp; p.  I can do tube cleaning then as well as finally painting the engine compartment.

Any other ideas?
