Subject: 1776 sp, stock intake question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Has anyone had experience with this set up? 
1776, 100 degree cam, extractor exhaust, stock intake and 30 Pict, stock SP 
heads, 5800 ft. above sea level
My question is what size main Jet did you find best suited?
I bought 130,135,140.

It might save me some jet change out time if I had an idea about what size to 
start with. I'll go to the dual Kadrons when I get the SP intakes from 
Ronnie(Oldvolks), but must use this set up in the mean time.
I'll have the High roof at corona de Tucson and Phoenix Bus O. Rama.
see you there.
Thanks for your help.
Kerry
