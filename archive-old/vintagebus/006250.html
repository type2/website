Subject: 67' shocks

The back of our 67' bus is really loose.  When you turn it wants to keep on
going!  Thinking of air shocks in back and gas in front or heavy duty gas
shocks all way around.  Custom interior with a lot of woodwork so there's
more weight in back than usual bus..  Any suggestions  on brands or info.
pls help.  Also sway bar was mentioned to us.
