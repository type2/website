Subject: trade a '65 camper for a '77 ...
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990304194839.008e01c0_at_pop.snet_dot_net&gt;

We have had our '77 Westy for almost 8 years, and it is going on 350,000
miles, I think Tara's magic bus is about to be retired. Rust has taken it's
toll. 

We also have a 1965 Westy, 77,000 miles, untoughed original engine, a
beautiful drive away side tent [used only by us], Roof rack, childs
hammock, the works. It is a beautiful bus that was owned by an older couple
that only used it in the summer for camping.

We are of to Newfoundland for a month this summer, and the truth of it all
is that we use our vehicles really hard. Our '77 was a work horse, it has a
trailer hitch, and i have used it to tow a car carrier trailer with our
Farmall tractor on it. Been everywehre, done everything.

But I had this idea. Instead of putting a new engine in the '65, converting
to 12volts , drilling holes for the Webasto hot air furnace,, etc. etc, it
might make more sense to trade our '65 for another '77. Tara's magic bus
would make a great parts bus, and someone could enjoy the untouched '65,
maybe more than we would.

So I am throwing out this idea. Would someone like to trade a rust free
'77, or '78 Westy, hopefully fairly low mileage, for our '65??

Give it some thought, or if yo uknow anyone, please let us know. We are in
Connecticut.

thanks, Jim
