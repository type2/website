Ken,

About the lights... This subject came up at work the other day. Steve,
the parts guru where I work, wants to dress himself and his wife and a
couple of freinds up with Christmas lights for a SCI concert in WA this
December, with batteries in fanny packs...

I'm no electrical engineer, but in my experience, most light bulbs that
will run on AC will also run on DC. I offered him this suggestion:

You could buy a string of Christmas lights from WalMart pretty cheaply.
Look at the string, see how many lights are wired in series, then divide
by 10 (120VAC vs 12VDC). Cut the string at the appropriate places, wire
into your 12V system, and there you are!

I have never actually done this, but I'm considering it myself, and I
think it oughtta work...

david
