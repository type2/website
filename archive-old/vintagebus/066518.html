Subject: re:hater cable &amp; transmission questions

if the leak is coming from around the boots, maybe the little bolts that go
through the boots are not tight enough. did you just replace these? if not
you may just need to replace them. i think any sealant you tried to put in
this area would not work, as the axle goes up and down, i think the boot
probably slides up and down a little bit.

as for the heater cable-grease is your best friend.
