Subject: wiper motor 6-12V

hi. this is a follow-up to a previous posting about converting a bus wiper
motor to 12V, using an armature out of a 67-69 bug wiper motor.
today i was putting one together for my 59 westy, and took apart a 68-69
bug motor for its armature. it is too short!, about 7mm too short.
i could swear i have used the 68-69 motors before. maybe it's a 69 thing.
maybe it's not. i don't know for sure right now.
tomorrow i'm gonna try to find my donor 67 motor and compare. maybe it's
only possible to use armatures out of 67 bug motors.
jon
