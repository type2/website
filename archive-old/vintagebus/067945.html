Subject: Clutch Part numbers

I recently made a post regarding the replacement of a clutch in a 66
Splittie.
I'm about to separate the engine from the tranny today.
Someone mentioned that I should replace the pressure plate with the 9
spring version.
Its a 71 1600 cc engine, 69-74 three rib tranny in a 66 splittie.
Anybody got the part number for that nine spring pressure plate?
