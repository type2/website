LH side of pod.
Church key, couple of screwdrivers, air gauge, little flashlight, small flat
plastic box with nothing in it, 6/8mm open end wrench, some small funny
piece that looks like it might have been part of a two piece church key, a
wiper arm set screw.

RH side of pod.
papers, a bunch of tie on tags used for recording gas fill ups to know when
to buy gas, (keep the current one tied to radio opening), red tag that says
GAS! to tie on the steering wheel when the reserve is pulled and I need to
remember in the dark morning, some big bolts/nuts, a box with an antenna I
bought at least a year or so ago with the idea I would plug up the two holes
in the nose, but never quite got around to doing, scraper, DOT amber lens
that looks like what is installed on my turn signals, some bulbs for
interior, several pens and pencils. that's mostly it.  Various little bits
of junk.
