Subject: Re: [VB] Drag Link

Muir has a really good section on steering.   do pull out your copy and read 
it.   Did the shop already fix the steering?  I thought you said it steered 
better but the wheel wasn't aligned anymore, but I may be mixed up.  I assumed 
that they put a new drag link on and didn't adjust it to make the wheel 
straight.   Before buying a drag link, make sure the old one is bad.  cause there are 
a number of bits under there in the steering, and all need to be good to have 
good steering.  

 Muir described this well, basically put on yoru grubbies and tuck your hair 
in a cap.   have a friend wiggle the wheel gently while you follow the 
steering linkage.  It goes from the steering gear box (right under the steering 
column under the steering wheel) and the drag link goes from there back to the 
swing lever.  the ends of the drag link are little ball and sockets, with a pin 
that goes through a taperd metal circle with a nut on the threaded end with a 
cotter pin through the castlated nut.  If there is wiggle at either end it needs 
replacing.  the swing lever should rotate side to side, not up/down.  A tie 
rod goes out to each wheel, check each end for slop.  then do the jack up the 
bus (I put the jack under the front beam in the middle, with a piece of 2x4 on 
the jack just behind the bottom of the swing lever, which itself has a grease 
point) and push pull the wheels for play like Muir says.    My riviera had a 
bad drag link when I got it, it made the slop a quarter of the wheel.  Or was 
it a third? That's unsafe!!!   well, at least look under there while looking at 
the idiot book and it should make sense. 

if the drag link is good, you need to park the bus straight, up on ramps is 
nice, loosen the clamp, pop off one end, the straight end, and make sure the 
threads turn (this can be a pain if it's old and rusty) and screw the tie rod in 
or out as the case may be so the end pops onto the pitman arm (attached to 
steering gear box) with the wheel straight.   don't torque the nut down real 
hard, check the book for torque value.  if it's too tight it's a real bear to 
undo next time.  put the castle nut on and insert cotter pin.

popping off tie rods ends can be a pain, a hammer on the circle the end goes 
into (after removing nut) usually works.  A pickle fork tears up the grease 
seal, so I don't use that if the end is good.

In any case, it helps to read the book so you understand how works your bus.  
Muir really writes sensibly for the non mechanic.   Also get a grease gun.  
Jack your bus up so the wheels hang, and grease the grease points until clean 
grease emerges.   grease is good.  your bus loves grease.  grease grease 
grease. each spindle (the wheel hang on the spindles) has 4 grease points.   there 
is one at each end of each front axle tube.  one in the middle at the swing 
lever.  early 63 and earlier, but check yours) have grease points at tie rods and 
drag link.  you will use about a tube of grease each time at first.  Grease 
is cheap.  This is part of your 3K mile maintenace, and is rarely done enough.  
should be done oftener if the bus sat, or you drive loaded or on bad roads.  
I mean the bus loaded  (like with Thom competing for the how much can I haul 
in my bus award)  not you loaded.  Muir also describes the link pin adjustment 
nicely, which is a simple procedure.    The blue nitrile gloves are not eaten 
by grease and make cleanup nicer.

Good luck, and don't the bastards wear you down.  remember Rosie the Riveter, 
You can do it!   Then take a hot bath.  :)

 Won't be in until Monday, maybe I will find one at another parts house.  =

 Maybe John Muir has a chapter on Drag Links for Dummies.
