    I want a rear seat-bed, i know that this not exist. I mean a rear 
seat to do the function of a seat and a bed in the back of my bus. I 
think i shuold need to make a experiment or invent something.

      If you have one seat like this or you have an idea, please make 
know it.

these are often called Z - beds- you can unfold it into a bed (with a pad over
the engine), or fold it into a bench (the mechanism kinda turns into a 'Z' at
this point)   They came in the SO 42 version of the westy camper, and also
other camper kits patterned on the westy camper.   I got one out of a junkyard
bay window bus and put it in my 61 non sunroof deluxe- bolts down with the
bolt places for the rear seat mounts.    The bay window Z beds have a self
support for the bed, the spitty ones need triangle brackets on the slope of
the engine hump (if these are missing it will slant down there, giving you a
bad crick in your baaaack when you try to sleep), s o with the bay window
version I didn't cut anything in my 61, which I didn't want to do, as someday
I may turn it back iinto a 9 seater, if I get a nice rear seat.
