Subject: RE: water spots

Haven't been paying much attention to this
thread, but once I paid attention, I have 
something to offer. Get thee to a glass shop
and check out what they have available.
Two products I have are A-MAZ and NOTHIN'S
BETTER. Both work well at water stains. I
cleaned a very stained glass shower stall
with them. Goes on like a car polish using
a non-abrasive nylon scrubber. This stuff 
is very very good and easy to use.

Jeff  no-bus, but I know how to clean windows
