&gt; Hey, where's the fan?  Just keep moving, right?  Wouldn't a BMW have been

There was (is?) a production motorcycle called the Amazonas built in
Brazil powered by a 1600DP engine.  A few were imported to the US.  They
had electric fans for cooling at rest and depended upon airflow cooling at
speed.
