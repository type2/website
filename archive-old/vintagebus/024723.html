Subject: Center Pivot reamer

Bill Bowman had asked for more specifics on the adjustble reamer I
mentioned using on the front end center pivot bushings. I thought after
the fact that others on the list might benefit. The following is pasted
out of my reply, so it may seem disjoint.

&gt; The reamer I've got is a &quot;QuickSet&quot; made by The Cleveland Tool Co., Size
&gt; H, 15/16&quot; to 1-1/16&quot; (23.75mm to 27mm). I bought mine at a swap meet
&gt; when I was about to do the job and already had the parts... I lucked
&gt; out.
&gt; 
&gt; The MSC 94/95 catalog (800-645-7270) lists a fixed 24mm reamer for
&gt; $38.63 (order #02298404). They list an adjustable Size H (must be a
&gt; standard... learn sumthin' every day!) in either import ($20.67,
&gt; #02239085) or USA ($91.21, #02231082). I guess since you're working on
&gt; an import vehicle, you'd want the import reamer, right? &lt;ha, ha&gt; Really,
&gt; though, for occasional use, the import would probably be sufficient, I
&gt; would think. I say that as a hack hobbyist mechanic, not a machinist
&gt; (but I am a quality tool nut).
