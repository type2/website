Subject: Re: [VB] '61 deluxe pics

OK, now I'm thoroughly confused.  I took a look at Adam Bruno's '61 pics
as I'm working on Jessel soon, (also a '61 15 window) and I noticed the
dash was red.  I asked him about it and he said that it was originial. 

Now just last week I saw my buddy's '60 23 window at his shop, also with
a red dash.  He said it was repainted and should be white.

What is the deal?

I thought that when the busses were painted brown above the beltline, the
bus was completely painted the below color (usually red) including the
dash, inside doors, etc.  When they switched to light colors on top, then
they switched to painting everything white first, then painting the body
color below.  

What color should my dash be?
