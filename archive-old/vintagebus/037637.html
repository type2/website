I offer up this question to the list... 
        Does anyone have a lead on a VW valve seat cutter tool? The seats on my
new heads seem to have a 45-degree cut on them. 
        The kind of tool I'm talking about would have an 8 mm stub sticking out
of it that would ride in the valve guide, for proper location of the 
tool. The cutting bit would have a 45 degree face on it... With a 
good, long, stub, it should be accurate enough for someone to use even 
on a hand drill, but a drill press would be better, IMHO.

Jason, 

I just happen to own one of the best small shop valve seat CUTTERS I 
have ever seen.  Yes cutter, not a God-awful grinding wheel.  It is 
made by MIRA in Switzerland and uses a diamond tip blade to make a 
perfect valve seat every time.  This is not a single 45 degree seat, 
it is a triple cut looking seat which is the preferred method for high 
performance applications, however, it works exceptionally well for any 
engine, even a lawn mower. ;)

It basically works like this:  after securing the cylinder head in the 
provided work area ( a long vice-like device that can be held by a 
standard bench vice ) you mount the cutter assembly to the work area, 
it is held in place by turning on the electro-magnet on its base.  The 
cutter pilot is inserted into the *NEW* valve guide and the cutting 
blade itself is adjusted to the proper size using a special measuring 
tool that is used on the valve itself.  This assures that the valve 
seat will be cut to the exact dimensions of the valve itself.

After everything is setup and secured, a hand crank is used to turn 
the cutter, you would not want to use an electric motor since these 
bits are designed to cut at a very slow speed.  Cutting feed rate is 
controlled using your other hand on a wheel at the base of the cutter 
assembly.  After 10-20 turns you'll have a beautiful valve seat that 
only needs a few seconds of lapping to be perfect...every time!

The bad news...as far as I know, this unit is only sold in Europe and 
it is fairly expensive, approximately $3,000.

The good news...it will work on *ANY* cylinder head, as long as you 
have the right pilot, it is very compact and portable, and requires 
hardly any training or practice to use.

I love mine and although I hardly ever use it anymore I would never 
give it up. :)

Good luck,

Jeff
