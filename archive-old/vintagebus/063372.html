&gt;Years ago (5) there was this great black square sticker with
&gt;white type which read &quot;Never Get Behind A VW Bus.&quot;

One of two things has probably happened:
1) It went out of style, as such things do
2) It uses two bad evil nasty letters of the alphabet next to each
   other, which caused the Zeichenschutzamt at VWoA to unleash packs
   of rabid lawyers on whoever was printing them

I would suggest that you use your favorite word processing, spreadsheet,
or presentation program to come up with a full-scale reproduction of
whatever sticker you want.  Print out a copy and save a copy to disk,
then take both copies to your local Kinko's, quick-signs place, etc.
They should be able to print it on self-adhesive vinyl.
