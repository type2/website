&lt;I bought a set of Deluxe belt line screws at a recent
show. The guys selling them said the deluxe interior
panel screws were the exact same screws, except that
the panel screws used the aluminum washers.&gt;



I think its more likely that the guys who sold them to you lied.  NEVER trust a swap seller to tell you the actual truth.  People will tell you what you want to hear, and also what sells a part.  I think Gods 11th commandment was &quot;Know thy part&quot;.
