&gt;Ever notice how Harleys have become a boutique item now?  I think
&gt;buses have come close to suffering the same fate.


Oh GEEZ! Of course I JUST wrote a post and signed with our cars, one
of which is my Bus and one of the others is hubby's Harley! :-)
_PLEASE_ believe me when I tell you these are our &quot;kids&quot; and not some
passing fancy! When posting, timing is everything! I knew I should've
posted my letter DAYS ago! Not right after Thom's! :-)
And PLEASE don't flame me for saying &quot;kids&quot;---I really wouldn't DIE
for them, but I'd certainly cry if either one was lost! ;-)
NOT a wanna-be,
Michele
