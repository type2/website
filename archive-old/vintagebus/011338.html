The other day I bought my dog a toy at the suggestion of the store employee.
As I looked at it I noticed that it had a very familiar shape, but could
quite place where I'd seen that shape before.  It's shaped like a 3 tier
snowman.

As I was reading the tag on it after getting home, it said that it was
inspired after a VW.  Once I read that it clicked and I went out into the
garage and found the part that it was modeled after.  It was modeled after
those rubber bumpers on the trans tubes so it doesn't hit the frame when
taking a big hit.  Then I was kicking myself, I could have cleaned up and
old one that I had laying around and saved $7!

The toy is called a KONG.

Doug
