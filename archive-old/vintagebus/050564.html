Subject: Garage/Shop suggestions

I'm in the process of buying a different house.  This one will have some
space for a shop off the ally.  I should think 3 bays plus some
parking.  I'd like some input on what people like about their shops or
wish they had or had built when they had the chance.  I'm in Southern
CA, so heating and air are not major concerns, storage, space, and
efficiency are though.  What do you like about your shop....don't
like???

Questions like lift or pit or both?  Roll up or swing out doors?
Separate work shop from main work bays?  Upstairs storage or storage in
an underground area or a outside shed?  Air of course, but what type of
pipe?  How much power?  8 foot or 4 foot lights? ect.

Any input will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.


Steve
