Hi all

Have an easy question for one and all. Are the hand brake cables for a 59 bus
the same as a 67, my local VW repair man said that they were different (maybe
longer he thinks)any help would great
- --  - -
they are shorter.  Alo it depens on whetehr yours cam eiwth a split case
tranny originally, I believe.   Hey considering my typos I wont try to
remember the numbers but I posted about this to the list recently it should be
in the archives, with chassis umbrs, changes, lengths of cables etc.   3/55-
may 59 cables are harder to find
