Hi All,
I have a small list of parts needed. If you
have these parts for sale or know who has, 
please let me know. All for a 62 westy.
1.  I need all the seals pertaining 
    to the fresh air vent. (inside &amp; cover)
2.  Two engine lid hinge seals.
3.  6v  horn 
4.  rear splash pan seals
5.  front pass side door with recessed handle area. Lower half only.
     (I'll be at the Red Barn swap. If you're going and happen
        to have one for sale, bring it on down)
Any leads on these would be greatly appreciated!!
thanks.
Larry Winther
