OK, so I think I already emailed you about growing up in Valley
Ford......but J&amp;W!!!

I can remember being a little kid (like 6 years old or something, around
1977) and hanging out in their shop, bored as h*ll, waiting for them to fix
my parents' square back (which we called &quot;Gypsy Blue&quot;). This was my first
experience with VW mechanics - sitting around and watching these guys work
on VWs. As far as I knew, getting your VW fixed meant going to J&amp;W in
Sebastopol. I have to ask them, but I'm sure my parents will remember Hans
from way back then. Glad to hear they're still in business.

And I wonder where my love for old VWs came from......

&gt; I wonder: Where did all my VW friends go?
&gt;
&gt; VW content:  I met another groovy mechanic today.  It was the sight of his
&gt; blue and white '62 Crewcab out in front of his shop that snagged me.  He
was
&gt; really cool, showing me all sorts of pictures and talking general VW
stuff.
&gt; That particular Crewcab has been in his family since 1967!  It's really
cool
&gt; to meet another who is way into the Volkswagen trip!  His name is Hans, of
&gt; J&amp;W Motorworks (I think) in Sebastopol.  Seems like a good place to know
of
&gt; if you're needing help in this area.
