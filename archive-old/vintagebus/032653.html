maybe i missed it, but what modifications do you need to do to make the
later tanks fit?  i tried putting a tank from a 70 in my 59 and it was too
deep to fit on the tray properly.  not to mention the straps (from the 70)
were also too short. i like the possibility of more gas capability, but
didn't like the way it fit in there.  i removed it and put the 59 tank back
in.

 I'm using a 15 gal tank from a FI
&gt; motor in my 63 panel.
