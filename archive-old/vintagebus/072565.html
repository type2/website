Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Shifting problems - an update

&gt; FWIW&lt; that was just to clean the amazing thick dirty goop old oil dirt scum 
&gt; mixture out.    I wouldn't do it is your oil is not nasty.    And I only 
&gt; drove around the block a few times *literally!!!!!!*  I mean, I doubt 30 wt 
&gt; will lube enough if the tranny is properly warmed up.  But it sure did flush 
&gt; stuff out!!!!!!!!!!  This tranny sat a while huh?

Ah maybe I won't then.  This tranny has only done 45k, it sat for about 13years I believe, then was driven for 3 years, then sat for a few years again, before been drained and removed about 18months ago.  So it has been drained a while.

&gt; 
&gt; Some times tranny's get crunchy from after sitting for years.  and then 
&gt; 'loosen up' a bit after getting a work out.    However, it'll not 
&gt; spontaneously go back to perfect,    I've had good results adding the slick 
&gt; 50 tranny goo to hard to shift trannies. 

I'll go and buy some of that then later maybe

&gt; 
&gt;  But eventually you might want to plunk down the dough for a rebuilt tranny.  
&gt;   Still, it can last for years, and tens of thousands of miles.  

I would like to be able to shift nicely so I guess I will have to!  My old box used to shift lovely, just used to pop out of fourth (my fault did not notice a leak and after a week being parked up camping, and then a 3hr drive home with little tranny oil)  

In future I will pull forward and check underneath before leaving a campsite!

Thanks
Paul
