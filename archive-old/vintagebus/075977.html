Hi Dave,
Definitely check all grounding points and absolutely install ground wires 
from the taillight bulb holders to the battery ground cable.  We have taken apart 
those nine prong blinker boxes and there are several layers of circuit boards 
with long rivets through them which sandwich all these circuit boards 
together and also act as electrical leads through these boards.  Unfortunitly these 
rivets loosen over time and allow for bad connections in this relay box.
