Subject: Re: [VB] Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

I *personally* know x-hippies who *borrowed* the tools
to cut the wheel arches on their own buses.  When you're
driving all over the country for whatever reason, it's
nice to have a little high crusing speed.

&gt; it was the hippies who started cutting out fenders?!?!
