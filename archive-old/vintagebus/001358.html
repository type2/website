Wow - both the Porsche 356 generator pulley and pulley nut arrived.  I found
out that I didn't need the pulley nut but I ordered it anyway as it has that
vintage look (large 36mm nut!).

First thing I did was remove the old pulley and belt and then when I went to
install the new pulley, I hit a major snag.  The 356 pulley does not have a
hub - only the machined slots for the hub.  What to do???

I took my Makita grinder and ground off most of the old generator pulley
around the hub.  Then I made a makeshift lathe out of my drill press.  Since
the old hub still had some pulley welded to it, I took a bolt and ran it
through the hub.  I used masking tape on the bolt to make up for slop
between the 2 parts.  Next I put a nut on top of the hub and on the bottom
and sandwiched the hub real tight.  Next I put the bolt in the drill press
and selected the slowest speed.  While it was running, I held up the Makita
grinder very carefully and ground off the old pulley remnants.  It wasn't
pretty when it was done but it was even.

I took my hub and put the Porsche pulley half on it.  Then using the vise
and some sockets, made sure I had both pieces firmly and evenly put
together.  Using the mig welder, I welded a seam and fused the hub to the
Porsche pulley and that was it.  I put everything back together, the #35015
belt fit like a charm (bless you list members who posted this info!), and I
took of on a little test drive.

When firing up the engine, I could tell that fan was running faster.  It
sounds like a jet engine almost. :-)  I drove the bus on a 9 mile highway
excursion and then cruised the town.  Never once did the oil light flicker
but I haven't really given it a &quot;good&quot; road test yet.

The only other thing I notice is a loss of power because of the fan - not a
whole lot but it's noticeable - not as much get up and go.  You sure can
appreciate why VW used lower gearing in their buses - they had everything
matched perfectly.  No extras were needed to keep an engine cool while
hauling a load.   I'm just doing quick fixes to temporarily make this engine
work for me until the 1776 is up and running but you can see how stupid
everything is.  I've put in a freeway flier and tall tires with a 1600DP.
Now that my engine runs hot, I had to put on a sump and a Porsche pulley and
now the gas mileage is suffering big time.  Gee, I wonder why?  With a stock
67 trans and 1600DP engine, everything would mate up and work with no
modifying and no extras.  VW had their act together because they knew the
limitations of their engine.

Nonetheless, I still forge ahead, admitting my mistakes along the way...
