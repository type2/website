Subject: Re: [VB] 64 Deluxe Resto Help

the stocker VWAC engine produces the most HP at near 4,000 RPM, on the
other 
hand the top torque should be about 2,000 RPM.
----------------- Clip ---------------
Its not stock.
Its about 1700cc 71 engine, dual port heads, dual carbs, has a hot can.
1.5 add on oil pan, remote filter, remote oil cooler, IRS rear suspension
w/68-74 tranny, K&amp;N air filters.
It starts to really scream at about 3200 rpms and pulls strong through
4500 rpms.
Its the loose nut behind the steering wheel that caused the problem. (Me
and PO)
I'm just waiting for good weather to put the clutch and PP in.
With all of the other modifications on this engine, drive line I need the
old parts in my hand before I order new ones ........... not much telling
what the PO has in there.
