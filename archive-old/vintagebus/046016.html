 This is being posted for a friend as I would never attempt such an evil mod 
 on my busses ;)
 
 He recently purchased a friends 1959 Goettls A/C single cab.  This is an 
 early 59 which should have a split case.  He needs to have it ready to drive 
 to Jerome as the bus hasn't been on the road in 25 years!
 
 Anyway, he has a spare T1 tranny and is trying to figure out if he can use 
 that for the trip.  He already attempted the nose cone swap but it didnt 
 match up at all.  He is asking for suggestions and so far someone told him 
 (not me) that he couldd swap out the hockey stick and use the t1 nose cone 
to 
 fit it in the bus.  I dont have any clue what would work.
 
 Any suggestions?

you can use a tunnel case tranny in a split case bus if you remove the front 
tranny mount off teh tranny and get an adapter plate.  don't mess around with 
nose cones and hockey stick - that doesn't make it work.  you just use the 
tunnel case type 2 nosecone for this mod.   you do need the ring gear swapped 
to the other side , or you get 4 reverse gears and one forward.   actually a 
guy I know is wrenching on race cars, and the car in question got something 
fried in the tranny, and the driver ended up doing the last circuit in 
reverse, including a jump!  but if you don't feel like doing that stuff, the 
ring gear must be turned around.  it will the have a low/bug/.89 fourth gear, 
instead of the bus .82 4th, so freeway speeds could wind it out, but it'll 
pull the hills better in 4th.
