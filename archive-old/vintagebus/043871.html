&gt; I think the 70 would be easier to do. More room. Look at those crazy baja

Well, really i dont think there is Too much of a difference. There is more
height i think as the transaxle is lower, but then again the transaxle
being lower reduces ground clearance for off-roading. The back end of a
bay is longer, but i think it only translates to maybe 3-6 more inches
between the bellhousing and the rear decklid... Its doable easily enough
either way from my research.  The main benefit of the 70 (or my 71) is
that you can use a vanagon diesel bellhousing on a bay transaxle, making
the swap dead simple!

&gt; I too am thinking diesel, hopefully a tdi vw in the bus someday. Dave in 
&gt; Oregon who was giving away the camper parts told me he had a buddy making 
&gt; diesel fuel from old vegetable oil. Someone in Oly is doing the same thing, 
&gt; so a high torque, effiecient, and cheaply fueled engine seems the way to go!
Yep, you can make diesel from veggie oil, OR i've heard with the right
procedure burn straight veggie oil. It has to be preheated so as no to
coke up the engine, thus you have to have 2 tanks, and can only use the
veggie on longer trips, but the idea intrigues me for sure!
