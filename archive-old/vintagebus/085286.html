Subject: Running hot

I just put a stock 1600 in my 63 bus.  I am having a problem with it running
hot.

I have all seals in place and pulled fan housing to make sure nothing is in
there.

Also replaced the oil cooler seals.

Is it not getting enough air, is this a common problem or should I look else
where.

Thanks for the help

Richard
