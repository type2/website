Subject: [VB] OACDP creeps forward...

Thanks to a slothful coordinator *cough* the OACDP has suffered a bit of
a slowdown.  But this is to let the list know that I have finally(!) 
made the PDFs that Matt created available for the tools manual and...I 
think something else I did a while back but never noted.  It had to
do with PDFs and VWs.

Cut me some slack, I got a new job and I'm moving ;-)

Enjoy, and there will be some more updates in the hopefully not-so-distant
future.  These will involve new manuals!
