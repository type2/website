Ok, we got the first of the breakin runs done last night.

During the 15 minutes or so at ~2000rpm, it developed a minor trail of oil
along the case, just to the rear (FIF) of the oil cooler.

Removal of the shroud and cooler sucked, this aftermarket (all tagged with
&quot;MADE IN TIAWAN&quot;) tin has .very. sharp edges.  And the rear seam on the
fan shroud does as well.  Turns out that the rearmost seal owas slightly
cockeyed in in the hole.  A 1 hr trip to my place to get new seals, (and
unload his old cursed engine), and reinstallation seems to have fixed it.
WE got another 10 minutes on it before the cops came for a visit (1.50
am...;)

The holes in the fan shroud for the accel. cable tube seem to be slightly
off rom where they should.  With the shroud seated right, the tube hits
the oil cooler bracket.  And the hole in the firewall tin is even further
off, toward the drivers side.  1/2&quot; or so.  Makes for an interesting
install.

I mentioned no provision for the hoover bit earlier...I was wrong.  The
shroud does indeed have the slot for the bolt, but there is .no. hoover
bit installed.  They do have a (very) thin layer of foam glued over the
cooler..my personal prefernce lends to something a bit thicker here, for a
better seal.


We seem to be getting a lot of .bubbles. in the oil. (up to now we
have...7, 10, 15, 10 minutes..42 minutes)  We warmed it up first earlier
to help flusht he old stuff out, and then drained the oil (17 minutes run
time, our first oil dump) and changed the filter.

The filter (sideways mounted off the oil pump) was full of air bubbles.
just foamy.  The oil we drained out was similary, but not as bad.  The
dipstick also showed bubbles in the oil, each time we pulled it.  After 20
or so minutes of sitting there would be no bubbles.

This engine has some varation of a wendage tray in it, but i'm sorta
suspecting that the filter setup is causing the oil bubbles.  Any ideas?


Oh, and its jetted rich. No surprise, every one of these new 34/4's i've
seen was jetted rich out of the box (for us, near sea level, Augusta GA).

Oh! the decel valve is really neat.  I like it.  Nice and smooth and
nifty.
