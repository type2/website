What a great show.  Charlie Hammil and crew really did their homework and prep work.  I went down with a friend of mine Dave in his '67 Riviera Camper loaded to the gills with all of my parts that I needed to unload.  Bumpers, doors, deluxe glass, sheetmetal, wood bed slats, cab divider, coke coolers, etc.  Dave had been involved in the OCTO planning committee so I got deputized to work the parking lot on the trip down.  Free admission and a free OCTO t-shirt, why not. 

My duties were to place the swappers in their appropriate slots.  Charlie H. is  VERY particular about how the swap area was to be set up.  What I couldn't understand is why he put me in such an important role since I hadn't attended one meeting.  Oh well, if Charlie trusts me I'm fine with it.  The whole time Charlie is riding around on a beat up vintage bike patrolling the lot making sure everything is just right.  He literally came by and checked on me every 5 minutes.  Things were going very smoothly.  Until this black and grey barndoor arrives in the lot.  The driver of said bus was told by the first lot attendant where and how to park.  The bus starts to follow the instructions but then makes a quick turn and parks in the opposite direction.  Well, now this dude is in my terrritory and I know Charlie is gonna bust my ass if I allow this guy to park the way he's parked.  I approach the passengers side of the bus and ask the driver if he's just going to offload some parts.!
  His response is &quot;Are you fuc*ing with me?&quot;  I responded &quot;No, I need to to turn your bus around and park in the opposite direction if you're going to swap.&quot;  He then responds &quot;Whatever you're taking, can I have some of it?&quot;  Now I'm thinking this guy must have had too much coffee at IHOP this morning.  Fortunately he turns around and everything is fine.  A little while later I'm parking more people and looking at this same black and grey barndoor and it clicks, its freekin' Rusty Van Bondo's AmbuCamper.  That was Jim Ellis!!!!  What a turkey!  I immedaitely run over and introduce myself and we have a good chuckle over it.

I finally got all the swappers parked so by 8:30 am I got over to our spot and started setting up my pile of treasures.  There were a ton of buses and people, it was a great turnout.  Around 11:30 Joe Crockett who was set up next to us loads up and pulls out and in zips a early Single Cab.  The guy came over and bought a couple of sets of bedslats from me and introduces himself as Axel from Germany.  Really nice guy.  He then goes back to his pickup and starts pulling out box after box of NOS stuff.  It was crazy.  First 3 or 4 people came over.  Then the word got out.  Withing 15 minutes there must have been 30 or 40 people surronding this guys pickup.  It was like the soup line at the Salvation Army.  I stayed completely away cuz I was trying to make some bread, not spend it.  It would have been way too tempting.  This guy definitely had the goods.

We finally loaded up around 1:15 and hit the road.  I saw Rosie parked not more than 30 feet from us but never saw Craig or Harry.  I did meet quite a few other listees besides Mr. Ellis, Richard (aka Rustybus), George from Hawaii, Matthew Henricks and Steve Harris.  I probably spoke with several other listees and never even knew it.  Can't wait for next year!
