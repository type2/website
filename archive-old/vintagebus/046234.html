A really great turnout, so great in fact the City of San Jose made the 
Vintage Club close the gates to cars at 9:45 am, which made A LOT of people 
unhappy.  Several list members couldn't park their Buses inside, so If you 
wondered what happened to &quot;meet by the Double Cab at 2:00&quot; now you know. This 
show is getting too big for it's own good!

The city was really anal about the show this year, but I hope they let it 
continue. The show is getting bigger and the grounds are getting smaller.  
The part of Kelly Park where the Spring Meet is held is in the Historical 
Park. Those &quot;Endangered Species&quot; posters with the old gas station and the 
Empire fire station were shot at Kelly Park.  Buildings that are slated for 
demolition but have historical value are moved to the park to be saved, 
restored, and eventually opened to the public.  How this effects the Spring 
Meet is that every year another house or other building gets added which 
takes up space where Vw's had been able to park the year before.  More people 
are showing up every year with less space to put them.


The buzz with the Vintage Club is to find a larger spot for the show, or to 
only let stock pre 67 Vw's in. (Cal Lookers, New Beetles and the like can 
park outside with the Hondas.)  There also needs to be better organization 
between the city and the club.  

I would like the show to stay where it is, one of the reasons I like it so 
much is the grass, trees and historic buildings.

The show was great otherwise. I spent some time with a lot of listees and 
other friends.  Bought some rear euro repop turn signal housings from Ronnie 
(conned my Dad into paying half) talked to VW Howard about the ride up, 
Thom's bus is bright! Showed my Dad Larry &amp; Ellie's S0-34, Talked to Clara 
about the parking situation, and chatted with Roger and Taylor at the SV2's 
booth. I also bought some front shocks for my Single Cab, and had Gabriel 
make a key for my locking bug decklid latch. I won a bubblehead clock in the 
raffle too.
