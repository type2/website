&gt;  Your adventure to Chicago, leaves me with mental hives, as I
&gt;  only have a 5 hour drive south on interstate 5 &amp; my 60 double
&gt;  cab will only do 52mph, my choice.
&gt;  Think I may change the route to smaller less traveled roads where 
&gt;  possible.
&gt;  
it is really odd, I have 99.999% found truckers courteous drivers, especially 
when I am on a road trip.  SOme trip I would pass the trucks going up hill 
(and be dodging through traffic to keep my momentum) and they would pass me 
on the flat, repeatedly.  And as I flash the lights for passing safely, when 
it is dark/not in urban area, I find the truckers do that back even.   WHen 
driving the 59 sc from the bay area back to oly, about 800- 850 miles, no one 
got mad at my slow truck the whole way- 55 mph.  everybody passed.    

I once had an issue where it was complicated but I was pulling back on the 
freeway from the shoulder and I did see a truck but they were way behind, so 
I pulled on, but evidently the driver did not realise (in spite of my 
signals) that I was pulling into the lane or thought I could accelerate to 70 
immmediately, when in fact the bus was stuck in 3rd gear and I was driving 45 
for a couple more miles to my destination.  It was very scary when the truck 
suddenly passed me on the shoulder.   I don't know how fast he was going in 
the right hand lane, but it sure was not 55-60 (55 was the speed limit then). 
 WTF

But I generally find truckers much better drivers than the average motorist.  
  Even if I drive slow, I drive assertively, &amp; have a 6V horn.

Or you could do what the Germans did- the slow vehicles there had a little 
sign in the rear what their max speed was- it was just a circle with the 
kilometreage in it, but you could stick something to the truck bumper that 
says &quot;52mph max&quot;,

or write in large letter on the back of it &quot;40hp at work, please just pass&quot;
