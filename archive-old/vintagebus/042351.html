Subject: [VB] Metal brake line lengths?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9912201131390.24633-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

After a quick survey yesterday, I am extending the brake rebuild to the
metal lines as well as the rubber lines and cylinders (and shoes, etc.)  I
know I can pull and measure, but would prefer to get the old out and the
new in without leaving the system open for any length of time, thus...

Has anyone measured up the lengths of the metal lines?  this bus is an
early '67 with a single circuit MC, so we are talking ?'64? to '66 here, I
think.  I know from reading Bob Hoovers' sermons that I need bubble flare
ends.
