Subject: Power Outage

Bus owners:

We experienced a power outage this morning at about 8:30  during a storm. We
were cut off from the customers we were talking to on the phone at the time.

We just want everyone to know that we did not hang up on anyone and that the
power is now back on.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Charles &amp; Walt and everyone here.

Thank You,
Bus Boys, Inc.
