Subject: NEW Bus Tent Question
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all,
I would just like to inquire from all you knowing minds....
Does ANYONE know the source for the &quot;Shade covers&quot; that someone is making
for the bus cargo doors ??Its mostly a fancy cover that sits on top of the
cargo doors when they are partially opened...I believe that there is also
tent of some sort being made for the rear hatch.....
I think that West Coast metric has them but they are Waaaaayyyyyy
over-priced....
Thank you in advance  for any and all help...
Have a great week-end !!
Jim
