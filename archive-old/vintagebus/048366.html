Martin,

Well, I haven't yet learned all the names for all those parts down there
in front, but I do know mechanically what is going on down there. I
don't have a Bentley yet, but I will get one (as funds allow)! 

One of the nice things about working where I do is that I can check the
parts manuals and see how those parts fit together, and what they are
called. From what I saw, though, all I know is that I need &quot;upper pins
and bushings&quot;. 

Ok, for my info and for others out there as ignorant as me, which are
the kingpins and which are the linkpins?
-- - -- - - -  - -
the kingpins are vertical, one per side, the linkpins horizontal, 2 per side.

BTW, the linkpin adjustng procedure with good drawings by the amzing 
illustrator Peter Ashwandan (sp?), who evidently liked parts lists and it 
shows, are in the Idiot Book by John Muir.
