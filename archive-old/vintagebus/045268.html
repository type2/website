I'm completely blind when it comes to this. It's a learning process. I've

got an engine which is incomplete. I would like to rebuilt it but first I

need to know what it is. Up, on the front it has these numbers stamped: AK

104966. Now the alternator and starter are both 6V so I assume it's an early

bus or bug engine but which one?

Is it that difficult to convert it to 12V? That's what I'd like to do.


Thanks.

an AK case is a good choice- later alloy, dual relief, large oil passages.    
Yes it will work in your split.  It is newer than your split, BTW.

is would have come as 12V, that is just the stuff you put on the motor/long 
block.   

does it have a bug or bus muffler? How incomplete is it?  whatever, you will 
put on there the stuff for your bus.  Read the idiot/muir book chapter on 
rebuilding severl times, preferably part of it sitting on a milk crate behind 
your bus r looking at your core motor (is it really dead?)    Read also in 
the bentley book, although that book is not as beginning friendly.
