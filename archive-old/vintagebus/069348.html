Subject: RE: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

vwvince has it right,also ask Ellis about smoking dashes.


You need two relays triggered by 56a and 56b of the foot switch(this keeps
the current off the foot switch)on a 65 and earlier vehicle and a new FUSED
at the rear 8ga feed wire.

You will only need one relay in a 66-67 using the head light switch terminal
56 as the trigger feeding terminal 56 on the high/low relay.Also do the 8ga
fused feed here.
If you want to get fancy Hella makes a fused relay.

I am currently running Cibie E-code non-DOT Z Beams with 65-100W
Sylvania/Osram lamps in the 59 and they are hands down the best.Good beam
pattern and excellant cutoff so as not to piss off other drivers if aimed
properly.I have had relays installed on this vehicle since day
one,installation was done while removing some really scary additions by the
PO's.

It is prudent to install relays with bulbs that have more draw than stock. I
have a three relay system in mine and pulled a new 8g main power wire from
the battery + terminal to the fuse block under the dash to be sure I had
adequate power for the bulbs (and the monster stereo/amp/sub woofer)
I am now using the new technology blue 65/65 watt bulbs with better light
than event the 80/120 bulbs I had before.
