&quot;I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of

the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail 
from 
my fellow split-purists. &quot;

Then a lot of folks spewed a bunch of purist goo...

There is a big difference between a website and a mailing list.  No way at 
all would I want Bays on the VB mailing list.  Don't want to sort through all 
Bay stuff to get to good Splitty bits...which from time to time &quot;good&quot; 
Splitty bits are hard enough to find anyway.  However a Website is a totally 
different thing.  I &quot;love&quot; the VWPlanet and Everett even has, ohmygod, *Bugs* 
on that site.  It is just a matter of clicking to what you want to see vs. 
not see.  I'm sure Thom is smart enough to figure out how to divide it up so 
as to keep the splitty info and the Bay info segregated so as not to &quot;offend&quot; 
the Splitty purist.  

Thom, is it is your site, your disk space, and your time.  Do what you want.  
Sure, it would be great if someone from the Bay community stepped forward but 
until that happens maybe you could lend a hand.  Isn't helping each other out 
part of the hobby?
