 I recently ordered a tow bar made for busses that is just like the common
 type for bugs only longer and with bigger front axle brackets.  I plan to
 tow home a 23 window bus from my top secret junk yard.  ;-) Anyway, the
 bus has no engine but does have a transmission.  I have heard that towing
 a bus which has a transmission but no engine is not good on the
 transmission.  Has anyone else heard of this?  Is it true and if so, how
 does one tow without causing damage?  How does the bus track straight
 behind the vehicle towing it without the wheels steering to one side or
 the other on this type of tow bar?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

it's fine to tow a bus w/o engine.

make sure it has gear oil in it, preferably nice clean gear oil, and good 
tranny boots.  THings do spin in there, and a bus that sat in a junkyard has 
dubiously clean and probably ancient gear oil in it, and quite possibly torn 
or cracked boots.

leave the bus in neautral while towing.   Towing a bus at say 50mph while it 
is in first gear will make the tranny spin around in first gear much faster 
than it is designed to.

You might feel like jacking up the bus and greasing the suspension too.  
grease is good

The bus will track just fine if the steering is good. It will just follow the 
tow vehicle.   If the steering on the towed vehicle is bad it will be a nerve 
wracking drive, as the bus jumps and follows like a puppy seeing something 
really interesting over there.
