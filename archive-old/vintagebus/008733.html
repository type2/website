Subject: Why won't my bus accelerate?

I thought I was good with carbs, but I guess not.;-)

I just put a 30/31pict on my 1600 with a 009 dizzy.  The bus cranks and 
idles, but when you come off idle, the engine dies.  It's as if the carb
doesn't want to switch to the progression circuit from the idle circuit. 
 I looked at the accelerator pump, and it squirts gas alright.  I think
the &quot;squirt amount&quot; is also adjustable by changing the pump rod.  Should
I try to change this so it squirts more gas?  Or is it something else?

Thanks,
Christen
