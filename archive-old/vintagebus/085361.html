Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] vacuum diagnostics: engine strong but
  manifold vacuum fluctuates

As for the differing spark plug readings. My previous engines all had 1 &amp; 3 
different from 2 &amp; 4. This was thru a 1600 sp with a 28PICT carb and stock 
intake and then to a 1600 DP with a weber progressive and the ensuing new 
intake. I now have the same progressive and intake and with my current 
engine, all 4 plugs look about the same. Maybe it s something to do with 
flow thru the head and valves.  Sorry no help, but maybe there is nothing 
wrong??
