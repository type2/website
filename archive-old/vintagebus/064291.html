Subject: Re: [VB] Wheels

I was going through the same thing a few weeks ago... since I needed to get rid of the BAJA wheels
that were on my Bus I have bought a set of 5 spoke wheels from Motorworks (used my 20% off coupon)
and am thinking about installing 205 70 X15 tires. Now you need to remember to make sure tires have
proper load range. You can not use regular car tires on your Bus. Go with load range &quot;C&quot;.... or as
it may say different on a tire itself, at least 1700 lbs. per tire minimum... I think that it shall
be sufficient.

good luck,

| Per advise of this list I am going to buy some larger tires for my son's 66
| bus. He curently has 15&quot; 165's
| I wanted to put 15&quot; 205's or 215's what I do not know/understand is the
| third number 65's, 70's, 75's?!?! Which will &quot;fit&quot; the wheel wells of a bus
