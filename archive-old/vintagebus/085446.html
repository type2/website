Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Recommendation

Hi,

Do you have a new radio in the vehicle? The new ones with a CD take a small 
trickle of current even when off. Its not supposed to be enough to make much 
of a difference to the natural discharge rate of the battery but in my case 
it does. If I don't drive it each week the battery seems to die down.

Chris Subject: [VB] Battery Recommendation


&gt; Need a new battery for my 67 Sundial Camper.  I don't drive it too much,
&gt; and it seems that every time I go out to start it, (about every 4-6 weeks,
&gt; as a rule), the battery is dead.
