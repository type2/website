I HAD put &quot;$100 bus&quot;, but changed it right before I pushed send. I guess I
figured some people would come back saying &quot;the skylight glass is worth
$???&quot; and &quot;the engine is worth $???&quot; and whatever. So to some people I
guess $500. To me, $100. But I'm a cheap redneck.


Ok I'll tate 3 _at_ $100 or 5 if there in the southeastern US, Where do i send
my check!!! I would gladly give $500 for a split like that. And you can't
get any cheaper or rednecker than me!!!
