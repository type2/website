Subject: VW Bus Bike Jersey on Clearance at REI

For anyone interested, I found the VW Bus Suntoi Bike Jerseys (both long and short sleeve) on clearance at REI this week.  I got them both for about 40% of retail.
 
I believe the actual pattern is called &quot;Windows&quot;. The best bet is to go to www.rei_dot_com and call the branch in Seattle or Redmond.  As of yesterday they had the largest selection remaining.
 
There was a Medium short sleeve here in Tualatin yesterday I can pick it up for someone if they want.  Postage runs about $6.  Of course, you could just call them and have it sent from there as well.


Enjoy your day!
