 Exactimundo.  I pulled the engine last night and one of the arms on the 
 fork had bent away from the input shaft about 1&quot; at the end, with the 
 release bearing sitting there loose.  The weld at the shaft gave way. 
 Not exactly sure why.  There doesn't appear to be any other damage.
 
 The arm looks usable if it were welded back, but I'm going to see if the 
 FLAPS has one in stock.  What's the conventional wisdom on this - are 
 replacement shafts shoddy?  Would I be better to have the original shaft 
 welded up real good-like?  This is a stock vehicle.

A new one is what $15 with the extra welds.    Some people say to use them.  
The only time one broke on me was in my bug and I replaced it with a used one.

Evidently the set up in a split case trans is different- you have to split 
the case to replace one.  For that reason when Finding a 54 kombi with a 
broken throw out arm,  we took the welding machine with when we went and 
fixed it and drove the bus 500 miles home.  The WELDED  on arm was fine for 
several years, at least.  I don't know where the bus is now
