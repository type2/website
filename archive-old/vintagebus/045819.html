Lets just put it this way.
The splits and ovals were in a big nice well kept grass circle, PLENTY of 
room to look at each car, take photos, ect.
The ghias were pretty good, not too bad.
The busses were parked on DIRT, and they were parked all facing torwards the 
same direction, parked in rows with NO SPACING, my bus has 2 feet on the 
left, two feet on the right, 2 feet in back, and 2 feet in front.
I think pretty much all the busses were the same way.
lets just say the golden gate chapter SUCKS.
20$ entrance fee too!!!!!!!!!!
yeah, TEN highroofs, it was CRAZY!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt;10 highroofs?  Dman!

That seems to be a common theme _at_ shows these days - organizational problems.

Kelly Park: not enuf space, randomness of swap and car parking 
Sac Bug-O-Rama: event workers looked downright surprised when cars showed up
for the show area.  And why do they make the cars entering the show drive
all the way around and thru the DIRT, and the vendors drive on the paved road?
Classic: gate workers seemed *really* slow...
