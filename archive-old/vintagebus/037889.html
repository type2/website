Bus scene!   HAHAH   I wish.  Its gotten to the point where i would drive
150 miles just to hang out in someones garage and tip a few beers.  I did
just find a 66' something for sale in an airport hangar close by today.
$200 and its mine.  The guy said its been there since hes been there and
that was 12 years ago.  Im goin out tonite to see it.  Sooooo.  if its not a
resto candidate, I'll be sure to give the list first dibs on parts off of
it.  On thoms earlier bus people post.  Im not a hippie, im not the richest
guy, Im not a original snob, Im no reseller, Im not a transportation needer.
Im just a guy who falls in love with the memories of all the good times i
seem to have when buses are involved.
