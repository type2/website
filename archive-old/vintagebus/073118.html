Hey all,
 I checked the library and I found information
pertaining to Bay windows. 
How much different is a split??
I have had some say the spring plates are wound tight
and others say that they come right out with out a
problem.
I assume they adjust the same mannor as a bay window??
thanks,
 Bryan
