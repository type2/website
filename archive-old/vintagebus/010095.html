Woops, I was a little vague.

Flotter Transporter was a dealer publication from 50s - 60s in Europe.  I'm
not sure when it ended publication.  I've seen a couple around over many
years, never wanted to buy them since they are in German and they were
expen$ive.  Cool pics/artwork though.  Any clarification on that is welcome.

I scanned my archives and she found a cover shot of one of the magazines.
It's on my website at:

&gt;
&gt; I want to know what the value of these are as I have an opportunity to buy
&gt; ~20 of them.  They are all of early 60s vintage.  I remember seeing them
for
&gt; $20/each but cannot remember.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
