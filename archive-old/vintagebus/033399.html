was writ:


Here's what I am up to this weekend,
    1)pull motor, strip to long block.torque heads(man,were they
loose!)change bad valve adjusting screws(new ones suck)
    2)sand blast all tin pieces(epoxy prime and paint tomorow in semi
gloss black).
    3)change all three trans mounts.
    4)new clutch,pressure plate and throw out bearing,check
forks,machine flywheel,align and torque.
    5)change trans &amp; r.b.oil back to GL4 (jack maynard is right ,GL4
works much better than GL5).
    6)degrease motor and all other components.(blow out all cooling
fins!)
    7)all new seals(whether they need it or not).
    8)lubricate all moving parts and ressemble.
    9)clean wires and engine compartment,reinstall motor.


ps. anything i forgot ?
- -  --  --- 

I know this is kinda later, but I haven't had much time for bus list stuff 
recently

fuel line
tranny boots
engine to body seal (well, you said seals, but weren't specific)
grommets for wires, and for brake metal lines
if you feel like it put a new starter bushing in a nd lube it (easy with 
motor out)
      if you have a bad gas sender, yank the tank and put a good one in., or 
if your tank has crud in it, yank and clean it (usualyl gravel and the hippy 
hippy shake knocks the rust loose, then use the magnet on a coat hanger down 
the filler neck for a month)
rear brake hoses (easier with engine out)
