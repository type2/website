&gt; Also, the set I found has a little water damage on some of the pieces... has
&gt; anyone ever tried to steam and then straighten a panel before????  

Hi David,
Clara did this a long while ago and we need to do the same.  Lay down a piece 
of plywood on a flat surface like your garage floor.  Wet the door/ceiling 
panels and put them on top of the piece of plywood and lay down another layer 
of plywood on top.  Lay down a layer of cement blocks or other heavy objects 
on top of all of this!  Wait a few days till panels are dry, remove heavy 
objects and plywood and enjoy.
