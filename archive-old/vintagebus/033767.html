OK, here is my proceedure

1. I find TDC then set the rotor in the center of the mark for number 1.
2. I start the engine, rotate the dizzy left till it runs ruff, make a mark,
then rotate it the other way till I get the same.
3. I then set the dizzy in the middle (between the marks), lock it down,
then drive it up a hill and feel the how it runs, I will generally advance
the timing from there till I hear a ping, then retard it a few degrees from
there.
4. After that it's all driving and minor adjustments from there.
5. After all said and done I will put the timing light there so I know where
my MARK is at for future reference.
6. All this is done with the engine at OPERATING TEMP, not just sitting
idleing.


ronnie   works for me

Damn you crazy lunatics.

good??
