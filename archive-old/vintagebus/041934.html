&gt;&gt;&gt;I didn't put it on ebay with the intent of selling it.  If someone
wanted to give me 3K for it...well...fine then if you really want...
Thats their decision, not yours.


Thats whats screwed about ebay. People who screw around with it for there
own reasons without really intendind to sell something.
