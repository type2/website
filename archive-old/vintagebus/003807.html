LMAO Kyle,
so true. Pour me another one too and let's talk lowered spindles vs just
pitching the torsion bars. :-)

&gt;Just a little family spanking. Pay no attention. While you may think that
&gt;this bashing seems a little rough, for those of us that have been here a
few
&gt;years it is a nice breather from our monthly brawl between the vintage
nazis
&gt;and the wheelwell hackers. We are all nice folks, didn't you read about how
&gt;one of the brethern hooked up the green young feller in Wisconsin that
&gt;needed a double door seat? Just sit back and relax, there aren't but a few
&gt;types of conversation on the list. Someone is broke down and looking for
&gt;help, someone just listed a part on eBay, the brawls, obscure little
&gt;restoration details, and mind-numbing reruns of tire sizes, GL-4 tranny
&gt;lube, WalMart toys and 009 flat spots-all of which will be along again
&gt;shortly. Feel free to start them if you wish.
