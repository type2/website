&gt;VW did create some confusion when it chose for  its designation of model 
&gt;year (rather than  a calendar year)  a &quot;working year&quot;. 

&gt; So it is possible to have a bus built in '64 that is actually a '65 in
terms of 
&gt;fit-out. 

I have two 67 model year T2s, both built in August 1966.  Some 66 stuff
like single master cylinder, some 67 stuff like 12 volt.  I really have to
be careful buying parts to make sure I get the right thing...
