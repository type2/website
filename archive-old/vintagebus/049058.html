I'll be there with my RAL2000 (yellow orange) doublecab. Meet at Thom's bright yellow panel at  10 am, meet at mine at 2:00. I'm bringing up a few goodies, '67 dash, '63 heater channel and vents, '63 nose in bad shape but good headlight buckets and a '67 floor with e-brake. Discount to listees. 

We're driving up Sat. afternoon, but can't camp. Where's a good/convenient Motel 6 or some such? Will peruse the net and post nearby places, let me know soon.
