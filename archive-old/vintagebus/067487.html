Hey Michel, I purchased the J.C. Whitney kit and it turned out to be the same
material that was in the Brazilian kit that my friend got for his 66 bus. The
only difference was that the Brazilian kit had the latch tabs pre-cut and the
J.C. Whitney kit included instructions on how to razor cut the latch tabs in
the felt. Other than that, it went in very well and firmed up the rattling
windows.

hi all

ive search through the archive about a new front windows felt channel and
all ive found is that we can purchase one at jc whitney.

Is this the best way to restore the front windows channel ?

where else is there felt kit for a 60 bus?

Ive seen COMPLETE DELUXE DOOR SEAL KIT for busses 50-67 on California
import, channel seems included, and there is a brazil and USA version... is
the USA version worth the extra money?  at least you get all the other
rubbers...

thx for any input

Michel Leard
