Hi all,

After noticing a growl getting louder from the final drive of my '65, I
decided to bite the bullet and drain the tranny and redux boxes. The tranny
was OK (just the normal metallic mud from 4 years of use) so I refilled it,
but sadly there were some sizable chunks of metal from the right side redux
box.

Weird thing is, when I drained the redux box it wouldn't stop draining! It
seems like it's draining oil from the tranny, down the axle tube and into
the redux box. Anyway, I plugged the redux box and attempted to fill it -
which took forever! It was like the oil wouldn't pass the gears or it was
draining from the redux box, back down the tube to the tranny. I hadn't
overfilled the tranny, but after it was all together again a checked the
tranny level and it needed an extra litre!!! Had none of these problems with
the other redux box.

What stops tranny oil flowing down the axle tube to the redux box? Is there
a seal in the tranny/tubes to stop oil going down the axle tubes? I mean, I
should be able to drain the redux boxes without topping up the tranny,
shouldn't I ?

Any help much appreciated....
