Subject: RE: [VB] Double Cab Floor Mat

I've looked into this for my 59 double cab... Ronnie at oldvolks claims to
have a mat from his 60 or 61 that has a number.  I bought a mat from a guy
from &quot;an early&quot; double cab that has no number on it and I recently pulled a
rear mat from another 59 double cab in a junk yard that also has no number
or symbol what-so-ever on it.  Go figure.  I was once told that rear cargo
bus mats had no numbers or symbols on them if they had no cut outs for seats
or anything... but have never been able to substantiate this.

Anyone else?

Roger asked:  I'm currently pursuing a rear double cab floor mat.  The
seller cannot find
a part number on the mat, but he does find a vw symbol.  I woudl expect the
mat to have a the correct 9 digit part number somewhere on the mat.
