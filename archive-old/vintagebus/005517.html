Subject: One more clutch problem observation
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2000 00:01:18 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I finished cleaning up the shop tonight and had a few minutes after
recovering from the stench of the burnt clutch and pressure plate to observe
the corrolation between the cross shaft clutch cable arm AND the forks that
hold the release bearing.  When the release bearing arms are straight up and
down, the cross shaft clutch cable arm is pointing towards the front of the
bus at about a 15 to 20 degree angle.  Is this good?

Later!
