&gt;
&gt;My DC ahs been converted to 12V, do the relays need to be replaced?

Yes, but there aren't too many.  There is the turn signal flasher,
mounted just to the left of the fuse box, and the hazard relay, which
on my '64 is mounted on the front (FRONT) bottom edge of the parcel
shelf on the passenger side, halfway between the defroster tube and
the door.

&gt;I have a 12V relay that I believe is the flasher relay, but its
&gt;obviously not the one on the wiring diagram.  Its shaped like a
&gt;box and has four prongs.  One is connected with a pigtail to the
&gt;right front turn signal, but the other three aren connected.

Sounds like the hazard relay.  Its job is to flash the front lights
when you turn the hazards on.  The original turn signal flasher
couldn't flash four bulbs at once, so the hazard circuit is wired
so that only the rear two bulbs are directly flashed by the turn
signal flasher.  The front bulbs are flashed by this relay - the
coil is operated by the turn signal flasher and the front bulbs are
supplied directly from the battery.  It's item J1 on the '63 wiring
diagram.
