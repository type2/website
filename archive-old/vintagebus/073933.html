&lt;&lt; Clara,
    Thanks for sharing your research with us.  Sounds like scoops help 
 provide cooler air, not more air,  to the engine fan vs. no scoops.  
 This info really makes engine compartment sealing obviously a critical 
 part of cooling.

------------------
 Without scoops some of the &quot;cooling&quot; air must be 
 sucked from beneath the engine through the rubber seals? 
................
I'm not sure that I believe that.  I think the extra air coming through the 
vents forces it's way out.   I would have liked to do more tests, about sealing.
-------------------

Air from the 
 scoops must displace some of this hot engine air?  
...............
well the way I thought about it was the scoops let so much more air in it has 
to go somewhere.  Ya the seals are supposed to close off the engine 
compartment and 
that should keep the hot engine air out.  I did do a run w/ engine lid open, 
but that was before I got the thermocouple set up right.  It did make the 
engine compartment and engine hotter though.
---------------
The slight difference 
 of air flow at the defrosters with scoops may have to do with the cooler 
 air in the engine compartment?
............................
I thought it had to do with where the air went, not how warm it was.  Like it 
was diverted into a different path.
pretty tricky trying to sort this all out.

    My 18 year experience with scoops on my '67 is that the engine runs 
 cool driving into headwinds.  The current engine is a low CR 1600sp and 
 I can drive it at a good clip into strong headwinds wide open throttle 
 all day long.  Everything seems balanced and working fine!   Gary Gibson
