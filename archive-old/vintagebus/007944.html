Spent the day working on the Westfailure. Time for a new motor, the old 400
smallblock finally got tired and we have a 1000 mile weekend towing the ABC
raffle bus to OCTO and the Classic coming. Got the new go-fast crate motor
in, should light it off tomorrow. Anytime you fellers start feeling bad
about how much VW parts cost, I'll let you in on a secret. I could buy one
of Denlingers restored 23 windows for what the Westfailure has consumed in
the 3 years or so I have been his caretaker. Stretched V8 Westies are real
handy, but they go through cash like gas through a styrofoam funnel. Can't
wait to start working on my regular buses...  By the way, Chevy dealers are
more than happy to support the products they've sold in the past. Have a
whole division for restoration parts. They don't get snobbish or rude, but
they make you bleed when you pay the bill. Very nice about it though.

Got the 2000 ABC raffle bus back from the members that painted it, and it's
looking sharp. Katie, you're going to crap when you see it (Matt and Katie
donated it to the club, she won it at the 6th Jerome Jamboree). It looks
like a giant shiny Reese's peanut butter cup - brown over beige. I think
this is the first raffle bus to be two-toned and I know it is the first one
to be raffled twice. When Katie won it they didn't get the heavy duty work
they have been recently, and after being involved in the last couple, I
think I understand why. Having a raffle bus living in your yard means your
weekends are filled with either working on it, or towing it somewhere so
people can see it. It's okay, but it's hard to watch it leave. I think my
neighbors have it harder than me, they watch me tow some crusty pile into
the yard in February, listen to me and Joe Ginter and Uncle Jerry banging,
grinding, and welding on it every Saturday and Sunday until September. Just
when it looks good enough to park out front, it goes away.

I love my PLF bra, for what it's worth. Worth every penny. Gonna send her
some more of my money and have her do some more stuff for me too. Ain't
skeered, neither.
