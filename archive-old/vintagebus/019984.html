If you suspect the testing equipment, either replace it, or validate it
against a known good one.  You can't arbitrarily accept numbers you like
and discard those you don't, and expect good results (unless you're a gov
budget analyst)  If he doesn't trust the -10v reading, then how can he
trust the +12.5 reading?  Maybe it's the other way 'round?  I'll bet a beer
that the meter's fine and the bus is miswired.

&gt; no problems starting or driving. The PO had taken the bus apart for paint
&gt; and labeled all the wires (some incorrectly) and after the show he was
&gt; poking around and noticed the generator was wired backwards (so he thought)

Could be.  Put a trusted voltage meter on it and goo from there.  Have him
d/l a wiring diagram and confirm the connections.

&gt; backwards and that is keeping it from charging? Would that affect the
&gt; starter too?

Yes, especially if the starter is getting long in the tooth.

&gt; Passenger side taillight will not come on. Power is going to both terminals,
&gt; we assume the housing isn't grounding so he runs a wire to a good ground,

The 58-61 taillights can be a royal mother to get working correctly.  The first
problem is getting it to ground to the body, then to get the bulb to make good
contact in the housing.  A good cleaning of both the housing contacts and
grounding surfaces sounds like it's in order.
