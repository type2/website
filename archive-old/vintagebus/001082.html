&gt;&gt;Dove Blue does &quot;rule&quot; IMHO! :-)


My wife and I were worried that it would be too 'gray' but after painting,
we both really like it!  Check out my recently painted L31 double cab on the
vintagebus_dot_com image gallery under 'stand by your van'.

But that only means that original dove blue busses should be dove blue!!!
lest we have too many dove blue busses! :-)
