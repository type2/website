Hopped into the splitty tonight to take a ride and warm up the oil so that I
could drain it and change it out.  Too bad that stupid me didn't get an oil
filter so here I sit - not able to change oil.  :-(

Anyway, I hit the highway to cruise and took a 15 to 20 mile trip.  Everyone
is passing me so I floored it.  Maxed out on the level at 77mph and engine
sounds sweet.  Speed limit is 65 and now everyone is falling back away from
me - nice feeling in a splitty but isn't the normal way I cruise.  Normal
for me is 65 to 70.  Outside ambient temp weas 77 so the oil temp never got
above 175.  Coming into town I surprised a few people who thought all buses
were lackluster in performance.  Can't help myself.

Anyway, babied the ol' girl the rest of the way home and parked in the
driveway.  No oil leaks either.  I got it right guys - I really did.
