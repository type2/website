My Sandblaster:
Campbell Hausfeld Gun- Walmart less than $20
&quot; compressor 5hp- Home Depot $300
large plastic funnel
3/4&quot; rubber tubing non-kinking
3 aluminum screens
chemical gloves
clear face mask

The CH gun is designed to be siphon fed from a bag of media.... I don't use
the tubing and metal spike which come with the package. Instead I wrap
electrical tape around the gun intake to shim it up for the large 3/4&quot;
tubing. Cut the funnel so the tubing slides snugly into the small hole. I
then hang the funnel directly above my work area at a height where the
tubing is straight up and down. Now I have a gravity fed gun which works
amazingly well. The gun will have to be used upside down since the intended
design feeds from the ground up. I use the 3 screens stacked together for a
shield. I can &quot;bare metal&quot; rims with multi-layers of paint in less than 5
minutes per side... This is a very efficient and inexpensive system for
rims, bumpers, ect.
I haven't tried the more exotic media available for thinner metal...
