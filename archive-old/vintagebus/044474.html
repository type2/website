Aren't you maybe a little touchy as people are dogging lowered buses?  You

  Well I really don't give a flying ____ what anybody thinks about lowered
buses, I wrote what I wrote because, as you say, transplanting a roof is a big
job. But if it is a big job, wouldn't it just be easier to fix your 21window
than to put the roof on another bus? Or is it easier to give up? Should let
someone else buy the bus, lots of low budget bus people who would love to get
a cheap sunroof bus to slowly restore as money permits, just don't cut them up
if it's not there time, and you think it is!

well, not sure about Joe's bus, as I haven't seen it, but actually it sounds
like he isn't cutting it up.   About the 23 that I mentioned that got cut up-
it was less work to transplant it, as it needed a whole nother bus under that
bus.   The guy who did it (my ex) wanted to cut up a rust free 66 nsr deluxe
to put under that roof section, but I said hell no.   NO ONE was going to fix
that 23 window.   If we hadn't got that deal together, it would still be
sitting in a field with the sunroof open, more rusted than it was.

So many people are really intimidated by junky buses, as that makes sense.
The 59 truck I got was mechanically messed up, but solid.  It's made of metal,
not rust!!!    Which is why I did what I did to get it.   I have a 60 SC (for
sale) that has the usual SC rust- rockers, a bit in the front floor, and the
under bed has rust, but the main bed is really solid,   (in Oly WA).    I
didn't fix it, but it is a savable bus.   But more work than hauling the other
truck home.   (800 miles.  barefoot.  in the snow.  up hill.  both ways)   I
hate the idea of junking a splitty.  Really I do.   But some I say, nope, this
is toast.  The Main frame rails are bending.  It is not a 54 deluxe.  It's too
much work.   Parts bus, unbolt all I can, cut off what I can, scrap the rest.

It costs less if you get a good body to begin with, than to do bodywork.
Unfortunately.   It is a PITA.  That is one reason why sunroof buses cost a
lot, they have rust problems, and so there are fewer, and a good one is hard
to find.   Sometimes saving a lot money costs more.     

And lowered buses are dumb.  haha.  point and laugh.

:)  no more from me on this subject.   my lip (fingers?) are sealed, for you
won't have to read any more of my self absorbed bs
