Subject: Re: [VB] re:clubs in general

Austin Aircoolers Gang has what I think is the perfect model for a club. 
Visit their web site and look around a little. Very cool club.
http://www.aircoolers_dot_org
-------------------- 
They've branched out and have Dallas Air Coolers, Houston Air Coolers and
Baton Rouge Air Coolers.
Very good group of folks, Dallas has about 35 active members after 4
months and is growing.
