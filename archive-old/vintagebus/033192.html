I belive the new round mirrors are repops. If you look, yes the vw part 
number is there and the VW logo, but the top of the circle is cut out, 
probably for copyright reasons.    Anyway they are reasonably priced (circa 
$20) and are a good copy.  May be a bit loose where the mirror attaches to 
the bit the clamp goes onto.  But then again, there are NOS ones out there, 
and I am not saying WW doesn't have them, but I would be surprised to find 
them priced at $20.

 be).  I got one and it has vw stamped on it.
 
 Good luck and sorry about the SOB that stole your mirror.  I used to live in
 Seattle and they would continually pick over my 75 scirroco for parts...
