Subject: light switch removal
Date: Sat, 15 Aug 1998 22:09:06 -0700

To the list -

I am trying to remove the headlight switch from the dash and can't seem to
do it. The other switches came out easy enough - remove the knob, unscrew
retaining ring with needle-nose pliers, out pops the switch. The headlight
switch, however, doesn't have the notches on the retaining ring. So how do
you remove it????

Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question - this is my first split resto.
