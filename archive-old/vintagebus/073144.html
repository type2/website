Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Everything I know about my tranny

here's a pic of the &quot;daisy&quot;:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~hazetguy/flower
click on the 087 pic. it's the white plasticy looking
thing.
i have never ever ever seen a broken one of these that
&quot;came apart&quot; in the trans. scored, worn, yes. broken,
no. the material they are made of and their location
makes them pretty much unbreakable. they are there to
eliminate noise of the axle tube when it moves up and
down and to prevent wear to the side covers and the
insides of the ends of the axle tubes. earlier
trannies (splitcases) did not have this part and they
wore there.

diane, it's really time to get a new mechanic. ship
your bus out here, and i'll fix it, and then you can
drive it home.

&gt; &gt;&gt;.. what he said was he thought it was in the axel
&gt; .. I think he said
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;tulip&quot; or some flower ..  came apart or ???

&gt; There isn't a good picture of these in either the
&gt; early or the late
&gt; Bentley manuals, or Muir.  There is, however, a good
&gt; picture in the
&gt; You can't see this part when your Bus is put
&gt; together.  It goes between
&gt; the side of the transmission and the flange on the
&gt; end of the hollow
&gt; tube that surrounds the solid drive axles.
