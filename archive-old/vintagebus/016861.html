Hey all,

Is it normal for the brake fluid reservoir ontop of the master cylinder to 
turn w/ the cap.  When I take of my cap I have to hold the reservoir 
container body or it will turn w/ the cap ontop of a nut type thing on the 
master cylinder.  Is this bad and will it let air into the brake system?

Thanks,

Eric
