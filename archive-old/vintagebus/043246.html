Valves too tight...not a good thing
Valves too loose....not a good thing either!
Valves have set at .004 on motors back to '53 and up thru '70
With some exceptions yes.
Engine codes D, G, K and R....and there are engine numbers that narrow it
down even more if anyone is interested, used long studs that went thru the
entire cylinder head.  These valves you adjusted at .008 intake and .012
exhaust.
BUT...I have seen where some of these engines have had the short studs
installed into them...and if that's the case..then they need to be
adjusted at .004 too...intake and exhaust.

Rule of thumb I use.......check under the cylinder heads, between the
pushrod tubes and feel the stud ends.  You'll get your answer there as to
velve lash set up and which is which.
.004 is the spec.     It should be a go - no go adjustment.
Too loose....the valve heats up due to not being able to transfer its heat
to the cylinder head.  Can cause loss of power, rough running and
increased valve train wear.

&gt; &quot;short stud&quot; heads I believe, where you did the exhaust at 6 and
&gt; intake at 4, or was it the other way round?
