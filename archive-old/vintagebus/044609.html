&lt;&lt; t's interesting to compare the VW cooling concept (and listen to the 
relative
 arguments) and then compare them to the equivalent Porsche ideas.  The major
 break in the two was at the 911, of course.  For instance, VW people argue 
 incessantly about cooling flaps, and how you doom your engine to a certain 
 death without them.  The 911 engine doesn't use them, and people get upwards
 of 300k on those engines.  Or the talk about cylinder fin attributes - the 
 larger 911 engines don't have fins on top of the cylinders - they're smooth.
 The cylinders on my 2.7 have merely a token of finnage
 
 BTW, I got the correct owner's manual for my 911 at the 'rama for the 
princely
 sum of $1  
  &gt;&gt;

what does a 911 do to cool itself- n how is the concept different that the 
old VW?

any one else seen that early KDF case- the one without the oil cooler?   I 
guess just fins weren't enough.
