in post falls Idaho I've seen a 13 window deluxe bus doubled in 
length with two more 13 window busses cut from the cab back and 
beltline up butted toward each other and crafted to the roof!this bus 
also featured every window a pop-out and safari windshields!all 
chromed too boot! for power he was running a ford v6 mounted to 
the original trans via an adapter and a nose mounted radiator.the 
thing was hidious but kind of cool in a way I don't understand?
very nice bodywork though no a bondo crack in sight!!

I talked too the owner ..said he built it some 15 years back to take 
his family camping he also told me that he was an apprentice at a 
volkswagen factory in the 50's!pretty interesting
