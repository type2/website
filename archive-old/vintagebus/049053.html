I put one in a doublecab last summer. Much easier to thread it through than I thought, and less time. If you cut the old one in the middle, and pull it towards the front and rear, you'll get a good picture of how it threads through the frame. I used a pull string on the new harness per instructions, it was more push with one hand and guide with the string that just pulling. Put the bus up on 4 jackstands, get a good creeper to speed the job. 
Also, print out the color wiring diagrams from www.vintagebus_dot_com and get it blown up and laminated at Kinko's or copy shop. The instructions are okay, but use the official diagram to doublecheck and to get the complete picture of the circuits.
Use fine sandpaper on all the contacts, make 'em shiny. Double check the location of the push on terminals, they're not easy to pull off! Use pliers to pull 'em off to save your fingers. Also, mount the fuse box with the correct clips. A buddy of mine installing a harness in a Ghia this weekend melted a couple brass terminals off his fusebox in just a few seconds when it slipped. Don't forget the ground connections on the rear tail lights.
