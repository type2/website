Whenever I see discussions about carbs, fuel pumps, and alternators - I
cringe when I read things like, &quot;You have to get an alternator fuel pump if
you are running an alternator.&quot;  Not true - you can dimple the top of the
generator fuel pump and it will work rather well.  It just becomes a little
tighter to install it and you have to remove the top of the pump prior to
installation but it will work in a pinch.

Also, the linkage for a 34-pict-3 doesn't have to be completely replaced
when swtiching from a generator to alternator.  I'm a bit foggy on the
details but I merely flipped my linkage over and did some other little mod
(can't remember it right off) and you can use the generator style accel.
pump linkage on an ALT equipped engine.

No grinding on the alternator housing is ever necessary for these things but
as usual, it's nice to run the _proper_ parts for ease of installation but
if you're pinching pennies and working with what you have, no major parts
purchases are necessary in order to use these parts on alternator/generator
equipped engines.
