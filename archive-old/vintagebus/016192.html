Here's the scenario:

The single cab  is up on the bed of a flatbed truck, which is on top of 
who-knows-what.  It's about 10 feet in the air.

There are large piles of stuff, very heavy stuff, in front of it.
three sides are completely overgrown with blackberries.  I know the terrain
underneath is not level, and it's impossible to discern
exactly what the topology is due to the overgrowth of blackberries.

Truck has a front beam, but no trans.  no front wheels

If the truck *was* sucessfully lowered to the ground, there are a lot 
of misc cars that need to be moved out of the way to get a
truck in and out to load up the single cab.  Thesecould probably be pushed/pulled
out of the way.

It's transaxle and engine (still bolted together!) are on top of some
junk some 40 feet away.  I'd wanna get those down too.

John Hicks can supply some more insight.
