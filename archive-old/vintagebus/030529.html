Subject: The SOTO guy

Hello group,
  I was wondering, does anyone know The SOTO guy?  This gentleman has
apparently cashed a check of mine last November 19th for membership, and
I've never heard(no pun) from him again.  Despite 4 e-mails that have
not been returned at all, I cannot get a hold of him to get this turkey
to return my money or even get a response.  This has been going on for
almost 4 months now.  Any suggestions?  Has the SOTO organization
folded?  Any guidance is greatly appreciated.   Aloha,  JD
