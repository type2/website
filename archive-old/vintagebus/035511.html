I just found some amber lenses that are identical to the bus 
brakelight lend only plastic.anybody know of the origin of these?
they do have &quot;hella&quot; and the part# ~k12628 A2267

repro, cameron, repro, like the red plastic lenses.  I have seen a couple i 
blue plastic too.

FWIW, my 53 came with an amber brake light, evidently this was/is normal in 
Holland.    Have seen amber lenses on a bd firetruck (lots of light on the 
back of that).    useful I suppose, if you want to hook up extra turn signals 
using back up light housings for your 61 and earlier bus
