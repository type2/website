While we are on the bench seat thread I wanted to give a public thanks to
Everet and the VW Planet for helping me locate the ulitimate, rarest of the
rare, Binz only reach bench seat for my Binz crew cab.

I went down and picked it up off the truck-line docks yesterday evening.  It
is a thing of beauty. Wife wont let me keep the cushions in side for fear
something will eiter crawl out of it or hatch, but hey, it a Binz seat.  Too
Cool!!  Thanks Everet!!!
