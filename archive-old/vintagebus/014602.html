Anyone out there get a letter like this one below??  I have no idea who
this person is.  Seems like a form letter to me.  So, if anyone needs
proof that there is a concerted effort to take the &quot;good stuff&quot; out of
the country in mass, look no further.  This person is not just a
passionate hobbyist  ....this guys in bidnesssss.  This is with a weak
Pound too.

ya- how dare those Brits lust after dry non rusted buses!!!!   It oughta be 
outlawed!!!!

um- I believe there already are people in business sending dry buses and bugs 
and VW doors to the UK, and have been for years.  You may already know somene 
at the US side of this business.  And is it a shame for people to import 
parts from Germany Europe, the original vintage parts?  There it seems they 
have more bits as the cars rust away, and here we have more cars (at least in 
the non salted areas).  But they have many more interesting VWs that the 
general versions sold here.   How about those people bringing Swedish 
barndoor buses over here?    My 53 was brought from Holland in the 50's, 
should I send it back?   Should buses all be near their original port 
destinations?

 Whatever.
