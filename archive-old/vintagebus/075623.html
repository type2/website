Subject: Re: Steering box seals

&gt;Does anyone know where to get the grease seal and gaskets for the
&gt;steering box on a bus?

It is your lucky day.  Go look at page 267 of the '58-'67 parts manual
at http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  If callout number 5 is the
thing you want, it's a Normteile (standard part), in this case a &quot;Seal
A 25 x 36 x 7&quot;.  In all likelihood, this means 25 mm ID, 36 mm OD, and
7 mm thickness.  I don't know what the &quot;A&quot; means.  The Normteile number
is N 14 907 1.  Anyway, a competent FLAPS or industrial supply house
should be able to turn that number into something you can actually
buy.

A bit of Googling finds Chicago Rawhide, which is apparently now part
of SKF.  Their parts looker-upper is at
http://www2.chicago-rawhide_dot_com/parts_lookup_457010.htm ; the only
25 x 36 x 7 mm seal it has is a Chicago Rawhide 9710.  (Tip: NAPA
often carries Chicago Rawhide seals...)

Back to the parts list, there is a gasket (211 415 135 A) for the side
cover, but no big gasket for the bottom cover -- only the shims you
found.  There are little seals under each of the 4 bolts on the bottom
cover - N 13 804 2, Gasket A 6x10, which means 6 mm ID and 10 mm OD.

In the Bentley (page V-9 7), they don't mention a gasket for the side
cover, just &quot;sealing compound&quot;.  They also say that the &quot;seals&quot; around
the four bolts on the bottom cover are really lock washers.  If you
don't have a Bentley, I strongly recommend getting one.

&gt;The one I have is a ZE or ZF or something like that (I'm at work and
&gt;don't remember).

ZF, which is short for Fredericksport Toothed Wheel Factory.  VW wouldn't
let them print the name all the way up the column, so they just put ZF
on the gear base.
