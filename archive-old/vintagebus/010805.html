Subject: Re: [VB] To Cut or Not to Cut???

There is a system made that is hidden and operated by remote control.  Go to www.customautosound_dot_com and click on the link for &quot;Secret Audio&quot; on the left.  I will be trying this in my SC one day.  It works off of a radio frequency remote control so that the remote doesnt have to have a direct &quot;line of sight&quot; to the unit, i.e. it should all work nicely mounted behind the seat(s) of a bus.

&gt; Bart,
&gt;   I had a neighbor make a nice wood box with no front or rear to hold my radio/cd player and I wedged it in the tray to the right of the pod. I guess I could bolt it down and make it more secore. I wish a company would make a fully remote controlled radio that could be put anywhere and a little remote to fit on the wheel or dash that could be slipped into a pocket or hidden. There's no reason to see the front of the stereo, but they sell more if it's stolen I guess. Radio block off plates are around and even repro'd, or put in a cheapo so the thief won't look for a nice stereo.
