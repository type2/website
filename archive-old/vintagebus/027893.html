&gt;Any one have a degree wheel for stock size type I 1600 dp or know of a
source for one? &lt;

These are getting pretty hard to find... But I could part with mine for $50.
JK :)

Try a junkyard, they will have piles of these things for pennies.  If you
want a shiny one, any VW parts store or mail order parts house can get them
for you.  They are all the same for Type 1 engines. 

If you are putting this in a bus I would suggest a Gene Berg Equalizer
pulley.  I think it weighs about 6.5 pounds and reduces engine vibrations.
If I were a rich man I would get one, instead I owe the tax man :(
