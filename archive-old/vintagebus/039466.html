Hey,
A friend of John's has a 1970 VW bus for sale, and after listening to your
stories about your daughter, well...I wondered if she has Internet access &amp;
VW connections, if we could get her and Michael connected?
He's got a pge up with pictures of the bus at
http://www.michaelmclaughlin_dot_net/. To contact him a person would have to
send mail to him at  michael_at_michaelmclaughlin_dot_net (he forgot to put an
email link on the page).

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;  Lewis

It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly 
how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the
Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power 
but to attract attention away from it.
