I was wondering how you tell if you have a dealer-installed Bus gas gauge
vs. something else?  I picked up a gas gauge at Jerome (which ruled, by
the way). It has the early RES -&gt; VOLL markings, screw terminal connections,
and is dated 1.58.  Someone mentioned to me that it also could be a gas
gauge out of a '58 Ghia.  Possible or ?

Thanks,
Everett
