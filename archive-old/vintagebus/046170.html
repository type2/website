 &lt;&lt; It looks like I can jack up the left side, unbolt the redux box from the 
spring plate (maybe remove the wheel first), pry the spring plate back a bit, 
and squeeze some sealant in there. Would this be possible? &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
Definitely remove the tire, and use a jackstand to support that one corner of 
the bus.  Drian the reduction box completely of oil.  The remove the 
reduction box from the swing plate.  Use a spray can of brake clean to 
degrease both parts.  Then you can use high temp silicon sealant on the plug 
seam, and when you quickly bolt the two parts together you end up sandwiching 
the sealant in place.  Eric&amp;Barb
