Greetings to all!

We were fortunate enough to host Richard and Gayle Miller who are currently
on the final month of one of the greatest bus trips of all time. The Millers
sold off all of there belongings, home and business in South Africa(I really
need to do the same:) and  hit the raod late last year. After traveling the
globe they landed in Houston Texas and bought a 1978 Westy camper. Since
late March they have been on the road, seeing the US, making new freinds and
becoming busphreaks!

Last week they rolled into Greensboro, NC to split a few days visit with the
Siberts and with us. I can only say that it was one of the three most
enjoyable days I can recall. The Millers are fascinating and wonderfully
fine folk! After three days we felt like old freinds. We even convinced them
to attend last weeks High Country Bus Fest with us. They had the most
exciting time being overloaded by hundreds of whacky bus poeple.

Now the Millers are heading south into to Florida and are having some
starter woes(hot start, you know the deal:). Any help with finding a proper
starter would be appreciated. The Millers are also hoping to find a driveway
or two to spend the night in. I can honestly say that you wont be sorry.
Richard and Gayle are gracious fun folk. Dont forget to ask Gayle the
history behind her wedding ring. Also ask Richard the proper procedure for
accurately putting a hole through several layers of roofing:) You wont be
sorry that you asked.

Below are some notes from Richard on about his starter trouble and a breif
list of where they are planning to be in the next few weeks. IF YOU CAN AND
WANT TO, PLEASE CONTACT THEM!!!!!!!!! Richard Millar &lt;rsmillar_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Wednesday 9 Aug 16.30 Collect friends from SA from Miami Airport
&gt; Stay in Miami a couple of days - depending on what there is to see &amp; do.
&gt; Then head to Key Largo and on to Key West.  We have been in touch with Mike
&gt; Green from Key West, who has offered to put us up...... We have until
&gt; 20th Aug to check out the keys and head towards Orlando, where we have two
&gt; weeks time share booked 20th Aug to 2nd Sept.
&gt; 
&gt; So our requests are:
&gt; Miami nights of 9th &amp; 10th Aug
&gt; Key Largo area 11th and maybe 12th Aug
&gt; Ft Lauderdale/ West Palm Beach/Melbourne from 17th to 19th give or take a
&gt; day or two.
&gt; 
&gt; All help for a driveway and a patch of lawn will be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; On the way down here &quot;Pumba's&quot; starter gave hassles when hot.  Either a
&gt; rolling/push by Gayle start did the trick or a tap on the starter with a
&gt; hammer worked too.  Hopefully I can get a second hand one for $30 or $40
&gt; either now in Fort Myers or when we go to Miami.  I have just made, like, 15
&gt; phone calls looking for a 2nd hand starter, without luck.  If there is a bus
&gt; fan in Ft Myers who knows where to go to get 2nd hand parts it would be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
