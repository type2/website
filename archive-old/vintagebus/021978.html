Hi Clara,
Sounds like the same problem we have had with bus taillights.  You really need
to run a ground wire from both bulb holders to the battery grond strap.  That
way the taillights will stop feeding eletricity through each other.  Eric &amp;

actually both bulb holders have retrofit (is this another MX code?) ground
wires , so they seem grounded well.   hm.....
