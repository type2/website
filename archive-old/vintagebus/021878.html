&gt;is looking for more highway and/or interstate climbing ability out of 3rd
and 4th, especially. No heavy towing here, only very light (maybe 400lbs.,
fully loaded) trailer, rarely used. &lt;

Are you kidding?  When you deep 6 the RGBs you raise the gear ratios and
have less climbing ability.  And with a trailer!  

Unless this guy is on the open road most of the time, where he can use the
extra speed and low RPMs, I would leave the RGBs alone.  The stop-and-go
daily traffic will be harder on the motor w/o RGBs.  Clutches are cheap I
suppose.

Put in a C/W crank and let her rev up on the interstate.

The only way he could easily get rid of the RGBs and be okay is with small
tires or a serious HP motor.
