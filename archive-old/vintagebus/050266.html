Subject: Met some listees

While I was in Austin this weekend on business, I had a chance to visit
with a few listees in the area. On Sat. afternoon I talked with Craig K.
for a few hours. Had a chance to check out is single-cab nose-skin
transplant &quot;mid-stream&quot;. He's got the old one off and the new one just
about ready to be welded on. It's pretty cool looking at a bus with that
off of there. But like he said, once you start taking the old one off, your
committed! Took a look at a few engine &quot;goodies&quot; he's got lying around.
Real nice guy. Seems to have a good handle on the basics of engine
re-builds. I'll be chatting with him MUCH more when that time comes for me:)

On Sunday I made a quick trip to visit Greg out in Elgin. He's got nice '61
single-cab as well. He drives it to Austin every day for work. Yeh! A true
VW guy! I took a look at a parts panel he had. I was told it was pretty
much picked clean. Usually when I'm told that, I get happy. I expect there
to still be plenty left on the carcuss for me to pick off. Turns out he's
like me. Other than the upper outward vents, it's pretty much all gone! His
son's got a '71 (or was it a '70) camper for sale. No engine. Good
interior. good solid project bus. Wouldn't take much at all to get it
driving. I'm sure he'd make a good deal to anyone that was interested. I've
got too many right now or I would've grabbed it. Another cool guy. Wish I'd
had more time to visit.

My wife spent the weekend in San Marcos and seems to have found a small
stash of splitties out in the country that way. I'll let you know how that
pans out!!!
