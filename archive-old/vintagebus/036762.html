but i thought you were all healthy, why do you have to go home
in the ambulator????????????????

congrats on your little girl, i have increased my gun collection
since i have had my little girl, sent her older brother to karate school
and have been practicing the new age lingo in order to comunicate with
todays kids.

later and good luck

ronnnie

ps. send up some photos of the family and we will put them up on the
stage at
BBB IV so at least you'll be there in spirit, or better yet just come
and let your new one have the true bus experience (brake her in right)

pss, do we call her ms. Van Bondoette!!





CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt;Paula and I are very happy to announce the birth of
&gt;our first child (daughter). Major miracle as both Mom
&gt;and Dad were told that we'd never have children.
