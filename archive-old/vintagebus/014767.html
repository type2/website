&gt; I won't be going your way, but hope to see you at
&gt; BBB, provided I get
&gt; my new Mexican engine installed this weekend.  It
&gt; sure is purty.  Hope
&gt; it works out as well as yours!
&gt; 
&gt; Any last minute tips about installing these engines
&gt; you would like to
&gt; pass along?

Look for my Green/White Sundial Camper(plates
read'SUNDIAL')with a Westy rack arriving sometime
Saturday morning.

As to my new Mexican engine(plug alert..that I bought
through Ronnie at Old Volks Home of Lake Havasu
City..end plug alert), I used all NEW everything that
attaches to the long block that could wear out and
sometime fail along the side of the road (which is
usually in the middle of BFE)and be sure to drill out
and tap the mounting hole to attach the bracket
holding the heater flap bellows.
 I now have about 6500 miles on the new engine and I
have had no trouble/concerns regarding the reliability
of my engine. I have adjusted the valves several times
and have found them to be right on. I have not needed
to top off the oil anytime except during the break-in
period. So far, no leaks at all, just as clean as can
be...no floor spotting.
I'm even thinking of ordering another engine for my
newest TypeTwo find, a 66 Kombi that had been sitting
for fifteen years in the dry! Nevada climate. Straight
as can be and 99% rust free. $500 was more then fair
considering the worst part are the three broken side
windows and one windshield.I just pulled all of the
glass I needed off a 67 Bus at the local PNP for less
then $20, and that price included a rear engine
compartment skirt and hands full of misc parts and
latches and stuff!! It helps when the owner of the
wrecking yard is married to my ex-wife.
I'm up to seven Type Twos Splits and growing......

Look forward to seeing all of my VW brothers/sisters

PS...Hey Ronnie, I'll have to stop by your shop for a
load of parts and sheet metal to bring back to Reno
with me.

PSS Any Bay window fans, I know someone here who will
sell 4 Bay windows Vans including a original factory
German High roof panel camper and misc parts and
engines for a total of 500$$
