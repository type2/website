Subject: Trouble finding engine tin

I'm looking for the little bits of engine tin that go on the back (front
is front) of the
lower half of the cylinders.  They measure approx 2&quot;x3&quot; if memory serves
correctly.

I can't seem to find them in any of my catalogs.

Thanks for any tips.

...Markus
