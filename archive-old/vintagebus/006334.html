This reminds me that I have one of those engine compartment fuse boxes off a
'59 Hatch-top Westy around here somewhere.   If anyone needs one, I can look
for it, does $5 delivered to your U.S. door step sound fair?

&gt;&lt;&lt; Do the two side Westy camp lights go to the back (engine compartment) of
&gt;the
&gt; bus or some other place?  Or do the go up front to the fuse box and I'm
just
&gt; not finding the wire? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Stephen,
&gt;The wire from the two westie interior lights should go back to the engine
&gt;compartment.  There it will have a fuse holder, and then connect to the
&gt;positive out side of the regulator.   Eric&amp;Barb
