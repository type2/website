Now Woody should be up to date on this subject but last I checked it was
like around $650.00. Get on the horn with all the moving companies in the
Yellow Pages. I would also check with some big carriers as sometimes they
have their semis going back to  Chicago half loaded. I might ask a few guys
I know. Care to know what they have to say?

&gt; Someone just asked me for a recommendation on shipping a VW from
&gt; San Diego to Chicago. He has checked out a couple of transport firms and
&gt; they want around $1100.00. Enclosed and insured.
&gt; Has anyone on the list had experience with this....He and I would
appreciate
&gt; some words of wisdom on getting this done without unnecessary headaches. I
&gt; think $1100.00 is more than he can afford.
&gt; thanks
