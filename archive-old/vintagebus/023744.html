Subject: re:wing windows

Hope everyone had a good holiday.  It was nice here in Northern
California.  Saw the post about wing window latch replacement.  The
latches are now reproduced.  They are not as strong as the originals,
but with proper care and being easy while opening them, they work just
fine.  If you choose to find an original, I have found that replacing
the whole wing assembly is the easy way to go.  Problem is finding one.
Once you pry out the glass and move the rubber out of the way, drill out
the original latch rivets and use normal pop rivets that fit the stock
size hole.  They will work just fine.  I have seen the original style
rivets, but I haven't been able to find the tool to crush them.  I
believe the latches are available through West Coast Metric.
