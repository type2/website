Howdy Volks...

My Todd Hill Transaxle has been doing great... over 1500 miles without
problems (3.44 R&amp;P)... a lot of that in very hard Las Vegas traffic (at
least 200 miles of that stop and go, much of it on Las Vegas Blvd over 4 to
5 days).  Plus at least 1100 miles cruising at 60MPH to 75MPH (mostly at 68
to 70MPH unless going uphill as required on this trip).

Anyway, I'm really heading out soon... plans are to depart Saturday...

Sorry I can't make the Phoenix show, would like to, but I don't have the
time to spare... need to get home to my new wife and take care of fun things
like taxes, computer rebuilds, etc.

Ronnie scored me a great one wheel trailer and spent most the day building
custom rear bumper mounts and re-engineering the trailer support to work
with my bus.  Works great on a short test run... need to hook up tail lights
and start packing.  So if you see a 1967 Westy pulling an aluminum trailer
up I5, that is likely me!

I will be checking e-mail up until I leave... so if anyone in Sacramento /
Eugene wants to get together, I'd love to plan it.  I can at least p-mail
you my cell phone number.  Sorry I wasn't able to come on the earlier trip,
but too much was going on.  But this trip is for real, if I don't make it
out on Saturday (for who knows what reason), it will be Sunday or Monday....

P.S.  With the trailer, will likely go only 60MPH for the first legs (maybe
the whole trip)... want to make sure the wind and handling don't give me any
surprises.  Besides, I expect my gas mileage to be pretty good with the 3.44
R&amp;P and Dual Kadrons at that speed :)

Thanks to all!
