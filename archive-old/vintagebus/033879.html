&lt;&lt;  I just received a steering box out of a 65 bus that is from a company 
called Ross (pn: 6222010139). &gt;&gt;

Hi Eric,
Our 65 Damage Numbers and Proprietary Parts manual with suppliments up to 7 
of 67.  It does not show any Ross manufacture of any of the steering box 
parts.  Mayhaps it is from an earlier year of manufature and got transplanted 
in the 65. 
  Does anyone else have one of these Damage Numbers and Proprietary Parts 
manual?  If so do they have an earlier print date than our 65 one?   Eric&amp;Barb
