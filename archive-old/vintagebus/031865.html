Subject: JP's road trip

Just got off the phone with JP (the famous guy from NM with his picture on
the front of the newspaper at BBB V), he ran off the road in his bus, but he
is OK. Said he didn't know if it was the wind or exhaust fumes, YA Right
:~), that caused it. Then Micah who's bus-a-vanning with him lost a hubcap,
doesn't make sense, it was JP who ran off the road! Anyway JP is almost to
Showlow, AZ. where he will spend the night before proceeding to Casa de
Kyle, were we'll be tomorrow night before heading to the Copperstate VW show
on Sunday.

ronnie az. keeping those who care informed
