&gt;Thom actually told me he had to scrap a good SC Roof Clip when he moved,
&gt;no one would take it, of course I didn't need it
&gt;then, but I bet that would have been fun to ship, if at all!


Actually it was *me* who scrapped the roof clip, and I did it about 3 weeks 
ago.  I felt bad about dumping a good clip, but it's just like the bed that 
I'm trying to GIVE away - everyone's giving me a bunch of crap about 
scrapping it, but NOT ONE person has stepped up to the plate and picked it up.
