Subject: Re: [VB]  Barn Door Questions

think I saw a later beam in a bd, but there was something funky about it.

if you want bigger brakes, why not use the 63 1 ton spindles?   same links as 
50-63, but use 64-67 brakes.

dunno about how the shocks would fit.

 Greetings All,
 
 I've got a few barndoor questions...
 
 Will a later front end (55 - 62) bolt into a barn?
 I guess the barn's heater pipe support panel gets in the way
 as the barn beam's pivot is offset and not centered like the later beam?
 
 Could you just bolt up the later 55-62 spindles onto the
 barn beam (link pins are same size?)?  Any related problems with
 mounting shock absorbers (obviously shocks are shorter
 on the barney)?
 
 Thanks
