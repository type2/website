I have been considering installing an alternator in my daily driver

   is,if in a pinch(if my memory serves me)you cannot push start a car with
   an alternator.I seem to remember that alternators need juice to produce
   juice,where gen. do not ?
   thanks, woody

True, but push-starting is not a problem (maybe that's &quot;automatic&quot;
   you're thinking of :-) )

   An alternator does need to have a battery in the circuit, both to excite
   the field coil and to limit the voltage it produces, but it doesn't take
   very much current to excite the field. I've push-started alternator-
   equipped VWs many times, even with weak batteries. You need a little
   battery juice to work the ignition, as well, since the generator
   won't produce enough for that at starting RPMs either.

   Timely question considering my '67 Kombi has both an alternator
   and weakening 2-year-old(!) &quot;Poop Boys&quot;-brand crappy battery.

Correct.  Push starting with either has no effect.

A little theory - and please correct if parts of this are wrong…

The generator is really a series motor - that is, the path is from a terminal
to the field to a brush through the commutator through a winding on the
armature (at any given time will be only a winding whose node is touching the
brush) through the other end of the winding through the commutator node 180
degrees from the first one through the other brush through the other field
winding through the other terminal. There are no permenant magnets, however,
only electromagnets formed by the electricity from the battery. This is called
&quot;exciting the field&quot;. The voltage regulator that VW and all other cars used
back then aren't really true voltage regulating devices in the sense that it
gives a perfect sine wave out with which an rms (root means square) value can
be obtained. The wave that this type of setup is more like a square wave that,
on the average, gives 14v (12v system). This is an average value. The reason
that it is a square wave is because the regulator has a points set that opens
and closes many times, in fact, as fast as the brushes connects with a 'new'
commutator node while the generator is revolving. When the regulator senses
that the 'average' of the square wave being generated gets to be more than 14
volts, the points open a little sooner. I think the generator is able to put
out about 18 volts or so if the points are held closed, meaning that the
generator has that potential. So the volt wave going out while you're going
55mph looks like 18v then 0v then 18v then 0v then 18v then 0v and so forth
with the points opening more than they are closing to obtain an average of
14v. At idle when the generator has the potential of only about 15 v or so,
the wave coming out will look like 15v then 0v then 15v then 0v and so forth
(real fast) as the points open and close, but here the points will stay closed
a bit longer to obtain an average square wave value of 14v. 
How it does this is that the voltage regulator has a couple of coils that the
generator feeds.  When the output is greater (faster turning generator) the
coils are energized with greater 'pulses' with each pulse from the generator
as the fields are 'cut' and therefore [the coils] can 'pull' on the point
plate more and keep the points open for a longer period of time thus
accomplishing a longer 'dwell' on the points to average out that big 18 volts
that the generator is trying to put out at high revs.  (There is a spring
plate that the coil pulls against) At idle the coils are able to be energized
a bit less, of course, because the generator is turning slower and thus able
to put out a smaller voltage potential, so the points are closed longer thus
accomplishing the same 14v average even though the generator is only putting
out 15v or so.  All of this is done without semiconductors, and the technology
dates back to 1890 or so and had served the automobile industry well. The
reason that alternators are more efficient is because they put out a pure sine
wave with no 'point dwell' losses. When those points are not closed, the
generator is not generating electricity for the system, so it is considered
'waisted motion'. This is why alternators are popular today.  You electrical
engineers out there could probably shed a bit more light on that.   Where does
this all leave us as to the push start problem?  

The regulator is not activated until the generator starts to move.  There is
no chance of regulator points burning because they are barely held open or
something.  This can only happen with ignition points.  (Yep - it is not good
to leave the ignition on because it is like playing Russian roulette.  The
points could be stopped on a lobe just right .. barely open so that they will
sit there and heat up and pit because of a bad contact caused by the points
being barely .. BARELY held open, although still making contact.  Also, the
coil could be turned on continuously and from what I can remember, coils like
to be turned off - a 50% or so &quot;duty cycle&quot;, if you will.)  And as for the
alternator - the regulator for one of those is built to do that.  Theory of
solid state regulators is more complicated, but suffice it to say that they
aren't harmed by push starting.

   I wont even BEGIN to tell you how Ive tampered with my voltage regulator.

I'll take a stab at this one - Greg probably bent the tab that holds the end
of the spring plate on the regulating coil in the regulator upwards as to make
it harder for the coil to pull down on the points set and open the points -
and thus forcing the regulator to deliver more than the 7.3 volts that it's
supposed to produce.  If he did, it might work but it tends to boil out the
electrolyte in the battery.  In my brother's '63 bug, we put an 8v tractor
battery and altered the regulator to do this. (We set it to put out 9v.) It
has nice bright lights!  

That's just a guess..  So Greg?
