&gt; There are now 1220 or so buses in the registry!
 
That's GREAT !!
But whats with the www.algonet.se/~fredbrun guy who has registered
dozens and dozens of barndoors and '55's???
Is this for real ?? 
I believe he even registered a 1950 !
just wondering.                
...........

ya, I wondered too, cause he listed my 53 by VIN, but as the wrong model.

So someone had a list from somewhere?   hm?
