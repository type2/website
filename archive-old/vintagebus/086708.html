Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

Hi John,
Somewhat depends on how you built the engine.  With enough $$$ and  madness 
you could build one out of a 25 or 36 HP engine case...
  If you used a 40 HP bored for the larger cylinders,  or 1300, or 1500, or 
1600 engine case.  You can use the engine  tin from each of the three latter 
sizes of engines, or a mixture of  such.  Though dog house shroud, fan, and tin 
are a must for 40 HP and  later engines in our opinion.
