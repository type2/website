first off the sdjust ment hole isnt behind the drum
its in front of the drum (hubcap side) next if they 
are actually frozen(rusted shut) like they were on my 58' this is what you 
have to do....

you need to get a 3 prong &quot; pully puller &quot; (i hope thats the right word) and 
it must be a heavy duty one.
set it up and just rip that dum right off. you will
thrash your  break shoes but you reall have no choice. i hope you find a 
better way than i did!
good luck
