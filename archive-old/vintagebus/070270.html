Subject: [VB] Berg dgree ring


Has anybody besides me had a problem with 
the berg degree ring for the crank pulley ?
I have managed to fail two of these rings,
which are activated with acetone, pressed
overnight, and fit the machined groove
on a &quot; Santana&quot; style aluminum pulley.
Despite following the directions explicitly,
both are delaminating, and they haven't even
been installed yet.
Is there a better glue ? Can these be saved ?
I couldn't get an answer at Berg,
they are all out of town for a wedding 
in Hawaii, for the next three weeks, 
( so I put my next order on hold too :)
