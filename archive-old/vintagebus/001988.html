Subject: Removing wheel drum from spindle?
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 00:48:01 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am trying to remove the centre cap from the front wheel bearing housings.

There is an obvious cotter pin in the centre of the brake drum casing,
presumably preventing the nut cap from comming off.
I have removed it, but can find no way to remove the cap.  I was assuming
that it was pressed on  and that underneath I would find a large centre nut
in the centre of the spindle.  Unfortunately the cap is too round &amp; smooth
to grip with anything to rotate it.

Is there some special tool used to get this cap off?

May be some secret skill or technique of which I am not an innitiate.

Any tips greatly appreciated.
