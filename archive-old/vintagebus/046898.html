Hi John,
As alaways it depends on the year and type of the distributor.  Assuming you 
have a Bosch or VW distributor.  The older distributors have a two piece set 
of points and you remove them simply by removing the screw that holds the 
anvil part of the points.  Then loosen up the nut and bolt that mount the 
spring of the hammer side of the points to the distributor wall via a slot in 
the spring.  For later points you just remove the lead to the condensor and 
the screw that keeps in the points.
  As for you burnt wire.  It sounds like you left the ignition on when the 
engine was not running and the points happened to be closed.  This will burn 
the wire to the points and to the condensor in a few minutes!  If we have to 
leave the ignition on we dissconnect the small wire (#15 or Neg. pole on the 
coil.) from the coil to the distributor.  Eric&amp;Barb
