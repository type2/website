Subject: Re: [VB] pit

I remember seeing a gadget at a Northern California VW show 5 or more years
ago. Vallejo or Pleasanton. It attached to the brake drums somehow and
tilted the car 90 degrees on curved steel rails. Powered by a 1/2&quot; drill on
a screw drive!  Anybody else remember it? They had a big Mercedes on it.
Just did a bit of research (googling) and found the Easy Tilter,
http://www.accessiblesystems_dot_com . Looks like a workable solution for
occasional underbody work. Tough to do oil changes though. Other good ideas
on that site too. If I had a welder and a pile of iron....

&gt; I think a lift would be more cost effective and useful.  There are lifts
&gt; as cheap as $1800 - you probably ca't do a proper pit for that, and you
can't
&gt; take your drivetrain and suspenion out with a pit.  I'm researching lift
&gt; options right now for the 2nd garage I want to build.
