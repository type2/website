It has been over a month since the 1969 bus was totaled on the way home from
Hanging Dog.  As of Friday, I settled with the other guys insurance company
and am now looking for a bus. I have decided that it is time to get a split
screen bus and the search has begun. 

I am looking for a bus with a decent body and interior as much as anything.
I do have a spare engine so that will take some of the strain off the
search. I am primarily interested in a passenger bus as we already have a
camper but would still be interested in buying a camper if it is the &quot;right
bus.&quot; I am also being realistic so I will not be looking for sunroof deluxes
and crewcabs :)&gt;

If you know of any pre 1968 buses in  North Carolina, Mid-Atlantic or
Southeast regions that might fit the bill, please forward the info to
ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com.
