&gt; In the
&gt; Jeromes I have attended there have been the drums, a case burn, and don't
&gt; forget the good old-fashioned sit around the campfire penis piercing. Last
&gt; year Don drove his Harley through a DD panel. You just don't know what
&gt; will happen there, but most people seem to have a good time. There are
&gt; some great vendors there.  Ronnie, Rex, Uncle Jerry, ABC sells those
&gt; psychedelic tie-dye t-shirts. you can get souveniers of your first time.
&gt;

Everything he mentioned is true, except he left out the part about what
happened after the case burn. These things happen at a lot of campouts and
are not usually a big deal, but when the nice people down in Clarkdale and
Cottonwood looked up at the mountain and saw hundred foot tall bongo dancer
shadows and a brilliant light, they thought the aliens had landed. Funny,
yes, but the emergency crews that showed up in response to their dozens of
911 calls were not nearly so amused. Seems they can charge a response fee
for every call and it would have run into the thousands of dollars. So, no
more case burning. Who'd of thought?
