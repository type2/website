Subject: Re: [VB] Found, singlecab, Long with bus content 

Once again, a day late and a dollar short.  As soon as I read John's first 
post, I immediately asked him about the truck for the next Jerome Jamboree 
Raffle bus.  The ABC board and related associates would dearly like to do a 
single cab for next year.  I read on and found John's next post saying that 
the truck was already spoken for.  Oh well. Perhaps someone else out there 
has a good 'lead' for us.  We are not going to limit ourselves to a single, 
but it would be pretty cool.  We have not done one yet.
