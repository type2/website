	&gt;   The ordeal is almost over, what you ask? Getting a
	&gt; container through customs, that's what. Due to a UNION
	&gt; squabble at the port because the shipping company decided to
	&gt; change piers my container has been held up at the port for
	&gt; over a week. One piers union rep didn't like the fact that
	&gt; the shipping line changed piers with-out UNION approval which
	&gt; created a nightmare at the piers.. Ship moved out of one pier
	&gt; to another then back, a real mess.
	&gt;    The irony of this whole deal is I got a break-down on the
	&gt; import duties and  had to pay more duty on 2 westfalia
	&gt; trailer hitchs then I did on my new Firebus, go figire.
	
	
	
	I can commiserate with you, Ronnie!  Especially since 9/11, it seems
	that getting a container into the U.S. is a huge hassle more often than
	it goes smoothly. In fact, of the last 10 or so I've imported, only
	one(!) went without a hitch.  (Actually, it literally went without a
	hitch, because another customs snafu caused a load of hitches to miss
	the conainer, but that's another story.)
	
	First of all, Customs is doing what they call &quot;intense inspections&quot;
	randomly on more and more containers ever since 9/11.  I've had the
	misfortune of being &quot;randomly selected&quot; about six of the last 10 times.
	I'm not sure why Customs would think a container of Volkswagen parts is
	a terrorist risk.  Maybe it's because the Libyan terrorists in Back To
	The Future drove a VW bus.  Anyway, when they decide to do this, the
	cargo must be moved from port to the Customs inspection center, then
	offloaded at the direction of Customs, who checks for anything they want
	to, from improperly labeled cargo to firearms. They'll go half way
	through the container, only to randomly pick a box of brake shoes from
	smack in the middle, open it, put an &quot;inspected by U.S. customs&quot; sticker
	on it, and then put everything back. This is all done by specially
	bonded union labor for $$$$$$$, at my expense, even if Customs doesn't
	find anything. (Which they never do. You'd think that after three or
	four times of inspecting virtually identical shipments from the same
	importer and finding only Volkswagen parts, they'd move on to someone
	else, wouldn't you?)  Take a guess at what this costs, double it, and
	you can imagine why I groan out loud each time my broker tells me that
	my cargo has been randomly chosen for &quot;intense inspection.&quot;
	
	Then there's the Department of Agriculture. (Yes, the Department of
	Agriculture.)  I often import a used classic Mini Cooper with my parts,
	as they're another hobby of mine. Well, importing soil originating from
	certain European countries is illegal due to hoof and mouth disease.
	What does this have to do with a car?  Well, a tiny bit of mud might be
	imbedded in the tread of the tires or splashed onto the undercarraige of
	the car. So yes, the Department of Agriculture gets to inspect any
	vehicles coming from designated European countries for this &quot;loose
	soil,&quot; which they've done two or three times. Same routine: I pay $$$$
	to have the container transported to the Department of Agriculture
	inspection site, where they inevitably find some trace amount of mud in
	a tire tread (duh!), charge me an extra $200 to fumigate the car, and
	release it. 
	
	Of course, it really gets expensive when both Customs _and_ the Dept. of
	Agriculture decide they want their hands on the same container, so it
	goes from one to the other and I get to pay for both. By the time
	they're done, the actual shipping cost of the container seems like a
	drop in the bucket.
	
	And then there are all of the steamship related snafus. It seems that
	they're constantly inventing new ways to screw up. Just one i that isn't
	dotted or one t that isn't crossed and everything grinds to a screeching
	hault. My present container missed the vessel and sat at port for an
	extra 10 days because the shipping company misplaced a 32-page(!!) fax
	of paperwork that had to be with the cargo for it to be loaded. Then
	they charged ME a fee for missing the boat!  The time before that, they
	forgot to forward a single-page steamship release form to the U.S. port.
	Nobody noticed it was missing until the trucker arrived to load the
	container and they wouldn't give it to him, sending him back empty
	handed (a two hour round trip at Teamsters rates). Guess who paid him
	for that wasted trip!  It's gotten to the point that I have to budget
	for all of these hassles when I set my prices, because as often as not
	some little thing will go wrong that costs big bucks!
	
	Boy, isn't this fun!  :-)
