Subject: loose heads

My neighbors bus has loose heads(1600 dp brazilian case), loose enough to
make an exaust type noise. He called the lazy local mobil vw mechanic who
tightend the 4 on each side most easily accessed (put loc-tite on them to)
and called it good. Neighbor goes out and drives the bus around this morning
and of course they still aren't tight. He's ready to quit. I told him there
where 4 more on each side and that there was a sequence to be followed and
to try again. He just thinks the motor is garbage and no need to try. So my
question here is- Is this a simple as it seems? tighten everything back down
to proper toque in poroper sequence and all is well? Is this going to cause
other problems? Any info would be appreciated.
