&gt;I was quoted $300 every 6 months with State Farm (my carrier) for just

&gt;Is there any companies for AZ drivers someone can recommend?
&gt;
&gt;How much are you paying for Bus Insurance?
&gt;With who?



that sounds  right - AZ is one of the highest in the nation!!
i pay about that with allstate for minimums.
unlike texas, where i paid 200/ 6 months for COMPLETE replacemment on 
the bus (i stated the replacement value of 6K).
