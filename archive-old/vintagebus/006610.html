But Thom, a lot of people come to these shows and it would be nice to have
them in a Bus Calender so people can make plans to travel to these shows.
Both VW Howard and I have yearly calanders in which we block out the show
dates well in advance so that we may travel to them, no show to far away if
planned out. At BBB V I know at least 3 groups traveling from the East Coast
to attend, which they planned months ago, because they knew the dates WAY in
advance.

To list all the &quot;Buses by the...&quot; and &quot;buses nowhere near the...&quot;  events, 
you'd need a whole new calendar...

&gt; January 2001 you could add Buses by the Bridge V, January 19,20 and 21,
