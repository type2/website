&lt;&lt; I was looking at the link off of type2_dot_com's library tech section.  on the 
link  &quot;Time-Sert&quot; by E&amp;B and then to spark plug thread inserts in their page  
http://www.timesert_dot_com/sprksert.htm they mention V.W OPTIONAL TOOL what's 
that?&gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
Looks most likely to be an alignment tool to help keep the tapping straight.  
If you call them make sure to inqure and inform us all!
 
&lt;&lt;Also, if you (anyone) has a spark plug kit what size is it?  part #?&gt;&gt;

14x1.25 spark plug kit.
 
&lt;&lt;Thirdly, how many of you as a matter of course use these as a part of a 
normal head rebuild? &gt;&gt;
Unless the head is new we have been installing the inserts into the rebuilt 
heads we use to prevent soft threads from pulling out.   Eric&amp;Barb
