[..]     Did you really expect them to have wipers in stock?  that's
ridiculous. if aftermarket suppliers are having difficulties getting them
from swf, why would you think the dealer would have some, and especially a
pair on the shelf.  maybe instead you could have asked them how the vw
parts network is set up, how the dealerships only have a limited amount of
space for parts inventories, how their ordering from their depots works,
and how they are probably obsolete through the vw network anyway--hence
needing to go to a place like ronnie's or a vintage specialty place.  i
dealt with vw for years, and while they do have a remarkable amount of old
&quot;nos&quot; parts still available through their network, chances are they didn't
have them on the shelf and had to order them. then again, they did have new
hubcap clips and rivets in their bins.  i found the best way to deal with
the vw parts department is to go in or call armed with PART NUMBERS IN
HAND.  their computer system DOES NOT have listings for busses earlier than
68.  so unless a bay part crosses over, they have no way of looking splitty
parts up anyway.  plus, i don't know where you live, but when was the last
time your dealer even saw a bus?  have you driven yours there to show them?
i also found that if you take the time to get to know the parts guys, they
tend to be willing to help you find things. i also found that many of the
parts guys are not into the vintage stuff and don't really know the ins and
outs of the older vw's like a true vintage nut would.  be patient with
them, and don't expect to waltz into the dealer and walk out with a
truckload of nos bus parts-it doesn't happen that often anymore.  
these are not new vehicles. we're dealing with 33+ year old cars.  you can
not expect vw to have every part still available.  if they were, there
would be no fun in restoring them because you could just go to the dealer
and get anything you wanted and what's the challenge in that? if they lost
a sale because of $40 of wiper blades, i think you need to reconsider who
lost on that deal.

&gt; Yep... wife and I went to a local VW dealer and wife started to speak to a
&gt; sales person about a new beetle.  I went back to the parts department and
&gt; looked for windshield wipers.  They did not carry them and said that the
64
&gt; / 21 Window is not supported. 
&gt; Went back to the sales man and told them that they lost a sell over a pair
&gt; of windshield wipers. 
&gt; Pissed the sales man went back to parts then went to the sales manager...
&gt; and he offered to pay for NOS set himself.  No sale!
