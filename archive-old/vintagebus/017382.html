Get a piece of aluminum and a fender mount antenna.
Shape
&gt; it to mount under the mirror bolt in the front upper
&gt; door hinge. Won't slap the front of your bus, gets
&gt; better reception away from the body and no holes in
&gt; the bus. 

thanks Harry, good idea. I've seen a bunch of the
dual- mounts centered over the emblems. I figured it
was a way to keep your emblem from getting 
ripped-off, But I think it breaks-up the clean look of
the nose. 

How about NO radio? I know a guy in high school who
cut about a foot's worth out of the center of his
entire dash, and duct-taped a boom box in the slot,
resting on top of the parcel tray. I wish I had taken
a picture of that, would go great in the hall-of
shame. Although, this was after he had made his own
&quot;deluxe ragtop&quot; by cutting the roof and snapping a
section of canvas over it with rivet-on snaps, the
dash was just icing on the cake.
