&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt; Are you referring to the driver seat pivot screws?  All of  the screws in
the
&gt; driver seat we can think of are VW only, and not ones you will  exactly
find
&gt; at your local hardware store.  In a pinch one could use  bolts with washers
&gt; for the pivot screws, and just bolts for the adjusting  screws.  Just take
the
&gt; seat parts to your local hardware store and find the  metric thread size
bolts
&gt; there.

There is a great hardware store near me that has tons of metric stuff.
I have been going there with lists of bolts since my bus came fully
dis-assembled and missing plenty of parts.
I have not been able to determine, by the parts list, what size those
pivot screws are.
&gt;   Good to hear you have found the bus parts manuals  _at_
&gt; _http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/_ (http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/)
&gt; Having the correct part name, and part number you can much easily do
&gt; searches on many VW parts suppliers websites (like Wolfburg West),  and
advertise on
&gt; many websites (like Thesamba_dot_com) for  parts.
&gt;  As for the passenger seat (assuming you have a non-walk thru) it  flips up
&gt; at the rear and has a pair of hooks to hold/hinge the front edge.

My bus is a walkthrough, I realized I should have mentioned this, but
I think that question has been answered. In either case, I should have
both seats recovered and at the very least I will be attempting to
install them by the weekend.

I am almost done welding back in the sheetmetal that was removed from
her and I am so stoked to get to tool around in her.

Thanks all for the help, I will update on where I end up and ask if I
need more help.

-Matthew
