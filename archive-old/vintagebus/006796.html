On working on my side loader I took the bumpers off to paint them
silver/white, upon removel of the brackets and looking through the scratchs
on the bumpers I noticed that they were never white! They had a greenish
primer on them, even the inside of the guards. The bumpers were painted
black and a nice job at that. Upon further examination, the belly pan had
the same paint (primer) on it. When I went to scrap the paint off of the
serial number in the engine compartment it was also this same primer. My
conclusion is/was that this bus was shipped to the U.S. unpainted (kind of
like a Binz) than shipped to the conversion people to be made into the side
loader! I could be wrong, I have been before, but this is just the
observation I made.
Conclusion, has anybody else ever heard of or seen a bus shipped to the U.S.
this way?? I would like to pull out the original headliner pieces but I
don't want to take a chace breaking them, they are perfect originals.
