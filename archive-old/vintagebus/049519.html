Subject: Re: [VB] plasti-dip for rebuilding wires...?
Message-Id: &lt;v02130501b4492a1bc406_at_[209.245.213.94]&gt;

&gt;i have a few wires that are lacking insulation, so i was thinking i could
&gt;just put some new insulation on them.
&gt;anyone ever done this?
&gt;
&gt;thanks
this is not a joke - there is a product called Liquid Tape (and other
names) that you brush on to bare wires; sets up like plastic.
i use it on ALL my connections, as corrosion will creep up the wire UNDER
the insulation otherwise. this stuff seals it all the way to the brass
connector. good for spots that get nicked, too.
