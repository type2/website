Hi,

In my quest for a roof rack I have gotten some offers from around the East.
One of the candidate racks is in Cincinnati, Ohio. Although It is possible
to ship it common carrier(LTL) it would seem safer and cheaper (free also
works here :) to have it come my way on top of a bus.

So the question is: Is anybody making a trip from southern Ohio to anywhere
near North Carolina in the next month or so and would you be willing to
piggy back a roof rack for me?

Also still waiting for word on a full length  kharma roof rack from the p%t
smoking dirt hippie in eastern Tenn or is that dirt smoking p_at_t hippie :)&gt;

Thanks
Chris
