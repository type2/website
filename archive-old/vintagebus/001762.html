As Thom mentioned the other day, there is a '66 either Kombi or Standard for
sale in Villa Park, IL about 10-15 miles west of Chicago. The guy claims
that it ran when he parked it before winter but now he can't get it to turn.
Also per this guy, it is a former Cali bus that was never driven in winter
with solid body and very limited rust. Interior is shot. No rear seats
except for Z bed. Z bed but it's not a Camper. Bus is titled and he wants
$1500.00 for it. I'm not able financially to buy it now but if there is
anybody in the area that wants a decent bus, this might be it. I might be
able to get a picture of it if it's not sold by this weekend. Also if
someone wants me to go look at it let me know. I'm in the area.

Later,
