hi all,

Sorry for no accent on the french word, but my e-mail wont do that...
(if i used it wrong thats my fualt, hehe)

Well, over lunch today i got my plates and title application etc. through
the dmv... I had been using plates from my 71, figure a ticket for
improper plates is small potatoes, so i did the insurance first... if you
dont have that they drop the hammer on your head.

Over the weekend i drove my bus everywhere, bad plates and all... went to
a birthday party full of bus people saturday, one bus guy that is stock
all the way and has nothing fancier than a 40 horse had me run my 1600 dp
through the gears several times as the speed with which it accelerated
with that small nut tranny gave him great joy. (now i know why some of you
guys are such diehard small nut fans, acceleration with a 1600 is
phenomenal, and it will go 60, which is fast enough for me... so far.)

Sunday AM i tried to figure out what was wrong with the clutch cable... i
pulled out the one in there and it was the same length as my known correct
cable... so i put the old one back in and the new one under the front
seat.  My throwout shaft was pretty goobered up, i just figured that
caused all the slack and put a couple of washers between the wingnut and
the arm to take up the slack. It shifts fine now.  Well, cant get the
shifter itself adjusted exactly right, but good enough for me. I'll play
with it some more im sure.

Replaced my broken decklid hinge and welded on the decklid a bit where it
was cracked... did it with my gas welder as i dont have a mig, i burned
through a couple of times but managed to fill the holes i had made...

Put in the stereo.  Managed to do it without cutting a single wire (it can
be done, its easy, so dont hack that harness!) since i will be running
amplifiers i ran my RCA cables to the back, and put up the speakers.  I
was able to use a couple of interior panel screws to mount those, so no
holes drilled there either...  Then i went to hook up my amp and couldnt
find it! ?!%&amp;%^  searched my basement, computer room, parents house etc.
Oh well, itll turn up eventually, but no tunes until it does... (unless i
undo my subwoofer amp and use it for the regular speakers temporarily...)

A friend of mine said i ought to at least paint the roof as those tend to
rust through quick, so that may be my first bodywork project, to sandblast
and paint that.  then the rockers and other than that i kind of like it a
tad beat up looking :)

At the Saint Louis bus club meeting sunday night everyone was excited to
see the bus running as i have been regaling them with my tales as well.  I
gave out a couple of rides, and after the meeting about 6 or 7 of us piled
in to get out of the wind and chitchat about plans for the summer etc.  It
is fun to have your friends all hangin in your bus, thats what busses are
for really. (at least to me anyway.)

A few interesting observations from behind the wheel: People stare at
this one a lot more than my 71, dunno if thats good or bad, i like
attention but too much makes me nervous.  Also, when you are making a
right turn you end up looking tourself straight in the face in the mirror,
somewhat disconcerting, hehe.  My wipers dont do doodly, i need rain ex.
Especailly since i am tall and look through the top edge of the
windshield.  Putting in a backseat cut the interior sound level in half.

keep the shiny side up...

Steve
