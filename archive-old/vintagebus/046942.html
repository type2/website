&lt;&lt; Since when do bay's have ambo fans and small pop
 tops?? &gt;&gt;
    
Bays had small poptops well into the '70's but mostly European and Canadian 
deliveries. This has no M code for destination port so presumably was a 
domestic German delivery. This would originally have had an SO 44 type camp 
set. 

Posted early today was an ambo set on ebay for a bay, they go in the vent 
tunnel, rare but available
