Subject: Subfloor ?

I learned a new thing while reading the posts about the slide out step:  I
don't know what a subfloor or belly pan on a bus is.  Regular, I've
got....did they lower the floor in some buses?  As far as belly pan
goes....my imaginings look like the regular cargo floor, with insulation
underneath, and then a panel to protect the insulation.  I think that sounds
like a good idea..

Please relieve me of my ignorance!

Thanks, Gene
