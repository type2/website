........... Cut it down to size................  even if you wouldhave recieved
on that wasthe right size for you poptop, you still would have had to trim
it.... they are usually about a foot too long ( better too long than too
short.....)

&gt; I ordered a new pop-top seal for my 1967 Westy.  Got it from Bus Depot, I
&gt; believe they source it from RMMW.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway... this seal isn't very close to the one that was on there... at
&gt; least what I can make out.  OK, but if it keeps the rain out, I'll use it..
&gt;
&gt; But the length is WAY TOO LONG.  Like 3 times what it needs to be.  The Bus
&gt; Depot order description clearly said 1967... but is this part possibly for a
&gt; loaf?!  It came sealed in the plastic bag with part number clear (and
&gt; description, which has no reference to year.  Just &quot;Seal, Westifalia Camper
&gt; Pop-Top&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Need a solution, heading on the first drive to Arizona in 24 hours!  Expect
&gt; lots of rain along the way or on return trip a week later.
