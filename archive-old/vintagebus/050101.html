Subject: Re: [VB] Elephant ear mirrors or round ones? Question... ????

&gt;I believe that the small mirror has been around the whole time and came
&gt;equipped on a lot of buses. But I believe that the elephants were an optional
&gt;thing, better visibility. Those terrible truck mirrors you see BOLTED to the
&gt;doors (one bolt in the belt line and the other in the window frame) of buses
&gt;were also an option. I have two boxes from Volkswagen that elephant ears came
&gt;in and I believe it says Genuine Accessory.


The really gennie EE mirrors are stainless and have VWoA stamped in them.
