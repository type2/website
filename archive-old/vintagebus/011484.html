&gt;Thanks to all for the encouragement. I forgot to say that my '64 has a
&gt;'67 tranny and a 1600dp. When I drove her home from OKC, where I bought
&gt;her, which is about a 4 hour drive, I did 70-75 the whole way without a
&gt;problem. This was in the summer and then she didn't have an engine lid.

Hey Chip dont do that 70 mph thing again ok? A 67 tranny just isn't 
right for that speed. I have a tranny in my 63 geared like a 1970 and I 
won't go over 65. 


Unrelated to that....
Cupholders. A magnet from a speaker holding a can will work where there 
is metal. My 69 had an interesting cupholder. A piece of plywood between 
the seats had holes cut in it. On the bottom, pieces of nylon stocking 
were stapled to the plywood. The cups, cans, bottles, would rest in the 
holes, cushioned by the nylons. This was like a shock absorber and 
didn't shake or spill the drink.

Jason
