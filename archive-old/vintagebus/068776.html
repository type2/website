&gt; &gt; Lowered means just that!  Slammed means that it has been lowerted and
the
&gt; &gt; windows have been cut down too and the roof lowered also.  I think that
is
&gt; &gt; correct
&gt;
&gt; no lowered is just lower
&gt; slammed is as low as she'll go
&gt; chopped is cutting down the roof height / windows
