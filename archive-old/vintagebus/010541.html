Subject: Seattle and back at 50mph

 Well I just completed another successful journey in my '67 DeLuxe hardtop.
I left Corvallis Oregon Wendsday morning with my wife and daughter and
headed up I5 toward Seattle. About 250 miles from here give or take a few. I
did the usual oil change and had my local VW shop (Independent Bug Werks) do
the little things I didn't have time for. ie tranny fluid top-off, brake
adjust etc..
 We stopped for cigars at my favorite smoke shop and hit a few rest areas
and managed to roll in about 7-8 hours after we left. 50-55mph the whole
way. Never 60!!..My bus has the original stock 1500 single port and even has
the govenor still in place. It will go faster but that is the &quot;happy&quot; speed
and we all want our busses happy don't we? I've had numerous emails about a
ring gear conversion but I'm not interested. Life is fine at 50mph..
 We stayed at a friends in Bellvue and made numerous trips into Seattle each
day. I must compliment the Washington drivers who seemed to anticipate my
need for lane changing and always let me in. My bus performed flawlessly. As
it always has. It's got 72,000 original miles on it and runs and drives like
new..IMO..
 We attended the cruise-in at Burger Master and I gotta say that place sucks
for food. I was sick half the night, but anyways..We also attended the swap
and show but I was only able to find a couple coat knobs to add to my bus.
I'm missing some hard to find deluxe stuff but one of these days I'll find it. 
 We drove home Sunday and my bus cruised down the interstate like it was
1967 all over again. Never a sputter or complaint. I must say this is one of
the most reliable, fun to drive, would take it ANYWHERE vehicles I've ever
owned. If you get a good one, take care of it, and drive it like it was
engineered to be driven, you just can't beat a well-running splitty. I'm
sure lovin' mine. I drive it everyday.
