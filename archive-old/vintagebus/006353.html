When I leave my 65 DC parked for more than a day I get a little bit of gear
oil that runs out of the drum and onto the wheel. Its not very much but I
cant find the source. I did notice that my axle nut was loose, could that
have done it? I haven't driven the car yet so there wasn't danger of the
wheel popping off, but the nut was only hand tight. The drip is showing
itself right under the wheel cyl but its not brake fluid. I know the stink
of gear oil any day. The bearing cover seems dry around its edge. The only
oily bit was the axle stub itself. I'm not sure if that was oily  from
before or not. Any ideas where to look next? Could it have been the loose
axle nut not holding the seals tight?
Help!
TJ
