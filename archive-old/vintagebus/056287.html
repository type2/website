Subject: RE: [VB] where does my spare go?

My spare sits behind the left rear roller cabinet on the cargo area above
the engine in my bus.  There is no spare tire well in the back... there is a
gas heater in the 2nd battery tray so it would get in the way.
Also...no bulkhead.  It never had one (flip seat)

Isaiah

Only two places it could ever go.

If you have a walk through it goes in the spare wheel well on the left rear
area of the engine shelf (inside above the engine) just inside of the rear
hatch.

On a bench seat model it goes behind the front 1/3rd 2/3rds
driver/passanger seat.

Thats it.

Did someone make a walk through out of your bench seat???  That could
explain why there is no spare well.
