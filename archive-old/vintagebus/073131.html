Subject: Re: [VB] king pins

That's pretty much what I did. I bought my rebuilt spindles from Wolfgang and a new king pin kit off of ebay. The kit I had bought was complete with shims and bearings. All in all it was a lot easir than I thought. While I was there I replaced all of my tie rods, seals and my drag link. I also replaced the center pin and thanks to a list member, I now have the correct reamer. (Willing to rent it out BTW) Anyway, that made a huge difference in the ride quality of my bus. Go figure too as I was pulling the pins I noriced that one of them didn't even have the bearings in it!!!
