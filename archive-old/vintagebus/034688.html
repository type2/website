&lt;&lt; i have an ORIGINAL vented cap of the same design, and plan on taking
 it apart and figuring out where to drill to vent the autozone cap. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The problem is that the vented gas caps are more complicated than that.  We 
disected a heavily damaged VW bus gas cap  There is not one but two spiral 
tubes made of sandwiched plates of brass to help prevent the liquid fuel from 
spewing out, but allowing vapor out while parked, and air into the tank when 
the engine is running.   Eric&amp;Barb
