&gt;From our former statistician, Unca Joel Walker.  As posted to the Vanagon list.

Flame me for cross posting it, flame him for writing it! (jwalker_at_URONRAMP.NET)

Jim

well, ok. in the old days, we used to write poety (laughingly so called),
about various subjects that happened to be upon the list's mind (?) at the
time. some were actually pretty neat. then there were the ones i wrote. :)
well ... i happened to keep the ones i wrote, so that's what you're gonna
get!

Klassical Po'try  (for those of you who remember English Literature, in its
many forms ...)

Depictus??
by Billie Ernie Hindleg

Under the bus that carries me,
  Black as the grease on CV balls,
I thank whatever gods may be
  For my decrepit overalls.

Smudges from axles, loosely gripped;
  I have not flinched nor cried aloud
As blood from my knuckles (socket slipped)
  Has colored the surface of this shroud.

Above these spots and greasy smear
  Are streak-ed paints of different shade
And stains of ketchup, mustard, beer ...
  I wear them proudly, unafraid.

It matters not how loud the gripe
  From friends or neighbors, wives, et all ...
I will not wash, though they be ripe,
  These funky stinking overalls.

ok, how about another one? :) perhaps a bit more elevated in subject matter?

Elegy Written on a Country Junkyard
By Thomas Gray Metallic

The setting sun defines the end of day,
  As doors and windows close against the night,
When tools and parts are left just where they lay,
  For easy use tomorrow at first light.

The cursing fades, the laughter ceases now,
  In ones and twos, the men are gone away.
Old Sol is slow to take his final bow
  As insects tune themselves and start to play.

It matters not the model nor the year
  Nor cost of purchase when the cars were new,
For like a graveyard, all will enter here
  To rust beneath the sun and morning dew.

But there are some whose Karma reaches out
  To kindred souls, for help to cheat the grave,
And whether whole, or whether parted out,
  Extend their lives upon the road they crave.

For these, the kindred few, this yard is not
   A place wherein their dread should make them shy,
Not like a graveyard, with decay and rot,
   But more a warehouse, open to the sky.

Tales of the Workshop
by Robert W. Service-Advisor   :)

            The Rules

When they step up inside, as you go for a ride,
And the first thing they see are the tools,
Then they'll ask with a smirk if you do your own work,
Cause they have no idea of The Rules.

For it's Tried and it's True: What you carry with you
Will help you get back; and it's certain
What you leave back at home, as the country you roam,
Will not help on the road when you're hurtin'.

As you go through the years, you will learn from your tears
All the tools you will need on the road,
And you increase the weight, in attempts to cheat fate,
Adding more and more tools to your load.

So the bus weighs a lot. Even more when you've got
All the spare parts your money can buy
Hidden under the seat, stacked so careful and neat,
In the hope Murphy's Law won't apply.

Now, it's sad, but in trucks, fuel economy sucks,
And gets worse with all that piled aboard,
But the point we make here is that gas ain't so dear;
Don't let tools and spare parts be ignored.

But since Murphy still lives, and he seldom forgives,
No matter how much you have pleaded,
The Rules make it plain, but we'll state it again:
Carry with you whatever is needed.

ok. so i'm bored. really bored. and you're gonna have to listen to me. :)

Klassical Po'try

Jabberwagen
by Screwloose Feral

Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves
  Did frye and syzzle in the van;
All sparkle were the splits and loaves
  And the idle thoughts outran.

&quot;Beware the Jabberwagen bus!
  &quot;The rattles that ne'er cease their speech!
&quot;Beware the Bus-Bus chorus line,
  &quot;And listen not to what they preach!&quot;

He lifted up his greasley tools,
  Long time the irksome rattle sought ...
Til slumbered he by the Half-Fast Tree
  And rested eyes in thought.

As as pretended he to sleep
  The Jabberwagen squeaked again,
Still certain of abilities
  To do its wants and when.

One, Two! Three, Four! And ratchet more!
  The hex-side socket felt his heft!
And with the rattle dead and gone,
  He gathered up his tools and left.

&quot;And hast thou silenced now the bus?&quot;
   They said as closer came he still;
&quot;Oh, Happy Day! Hot Damn! Hooray!&quot;
   And then he handed them the bill.

Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves
   Did frye and syzzle in the van;
All sparkle were the splits and loaves
  And the idle thoughts outran.

Mother Bus Rhymes

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To test a Vee-Dub Syncro.
Jill smashed trees, and just to tease,
Crushed poor old Jackie's ego!

Hickory dickory dock,
The chickens are all in a flock.
My bus struck one, as it tried to run,
The rest got away without injury.

This little bus went to market,
This little bus stayed home,
This little bus had premium fuel,
This little bus had none,
This little bus went Beep, Beep, Beep,
All the way home.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
How goes your Vanagon?
With coolant leaks, and throttle tweaks,
And a temp light that's always on!

Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet
Fixing her bus's fuel pump.
Along came a spider
And sat down beside her
And said, &quot;You gonna eat the rest of that donut?&quot;

Jack Sprat, he wore a hat,
   His wife, she wore blue jeans.
They drove their Vee-Dub bus around
   Just hoping to be seen.

As I was going to Spokane,
I met a man with seven vans,
In every van were seven seats,
In every seat, a wife with feets,
On every feets were socks and shoes
Embroidered with the Daily News.
Shoes, wives,  seats, and vans,
How many were going to Spokane?

yeah,i know. but i'm still bored. two more then i'll quit ...

Gunga Van
by Junkyard Keepling

You can talk of being stuck
As you're sleeping in your truck
In campgrounds with a water pipe that flows;
But when you're way out here,
'Neath the stars and sky so clear,
Well, it's something else again when traction goes.
Now in Arid-zona's clime,
Where I used to spend my time
On weekends in the desert off the road,
Of all them off-road crew
The finest one I knew
Was my old Volkswagen Camper, Gunga Van.
     He was &quot;Van! Van! Van!
     &quot;You can make it, yes, you can!
     &quot;Just slip the clutch,
     &quot;And stick it into Low!!
     &quot;You blunt-nosed old Vee-Dub, Gunga Van.&quot;

The paint scheme that he had
Was really pretty bad,
And less than what he needed, that's for sure.
But though he lacked for paint,
In his engine, what there ain't
Were only things my money can't procure.
He was made of stronger stuff
Than that plastic modern fluff,
And if a goat could make it, so could he.
And I'd often see surprise
In the young kids' widened eyes
As we puttered past them, stuck as they could be!
     It was &quot;Van! Van! Van!
     &quot;You're not worth the sweat of Man!
     &quot;Use your grip, and grab the dirt!
     &quot;Don't sling it out behind!
     &quot;You worn-out rolling junkyard, Gunga Van.&quot;

But the steel can't stand too much
Of the desert's tortured touch
A'fore the metal gives it up and has to go.
Yet, holed right through the case,
We still made it back to base,
A'bleeding as we crawled along dead slow.
The damage, though severe,
Looked worse out there than here;
Still it's a cost to bear when'er I can.
And though he's dead for now,
I'll build him back somehow,
And I'll ride again in hell with Gunga Van!
     Yes, Van! Van! Van!
     You faithful-hearted Gunga Van!
     Though I beat you and I flayed you,
     By the German steel that made you,
     You're a better bus than any, Gunga Van!

The Craven
By Edgar Allenwrench NoMoe

Once upon a midnight frozen,
As I drove the route I'd chosen,
Sitting at the wheel until my butt was sore,
Suddenly, there came a tapping,
Tapping, as if someone rapping,
Rapping gently at my sliding door.

&quot;Tis the wind, &quot; said I to me,
&quot;Tis the wind, and nothing more.&quot;

Onward through the night I traveled
As my confidence unraveled,
Thinking of the noise, the ill it bode.
Was it just a stone in hubcap?
Perhaps an unrefastened gas cap?
Or something worse to break and leave me stranded on the road?

&quot;Tis the wind,&quot; said I to me,
&quot;Tis the wind, and nothing more.&quot;

In the headlights, snow was falling,
Still that tapping noise was calling,
Calling all my senses back from whence it came.
Perhaps the cv joints need greasing,
And newer boots would make it pleasing.
Yes, that's the ticket! That's the one to blame.

&quot;Tis the joints,&quot; I sagely muttered,
&quot;Tis the joints, and nothing more.&quot;

Then, as if it heard my speaking,
The noise was silent ... my ears still seeking
Could find no trace of what I'd heard before.
On I drove, in silent waiting,
Waiting for the noise, restating
In my mind the causes I had thought ... and more.

&quot;Tis my mind,&quot; said I to me,
&quot;Tis my mind, and nothing more.&quot;

Throughout the trip, no noise resounded,
But always now my thoughts are grounded
In the causes of that noise I heard before.
Like a shadow cast by sunlight,
My wraith-like fears will follow; and might
I, from out that shadow, e'er be lifted?
.... Nevermore.
