&lt;&lt; I just got back from the DMV. 
 
 (you know it can't be good news when the story starts 
 off with &quot;I just got back from the DMV&quot;)
 
 Recently, I bought a '60 (built sept. '59)DC with a set 
 of PRISTINE yellow with black lettered CA plates. 
 Yesterday, I received new plates that are 7 digits of 
 reflective ugly in the mail. I go to the DMV (insert 
 rant about lines, rudness, etc here) to fill out 
 a &quot;statement of facts&quot; of how I didn't want them, I 
 didn't request them, that I have both old ones in good 
 shape and please Mr. bureaucrat can I keep the old 
 ones?? Hopefully I won't get some by-the-book bean 
 counter who will deny my request!
 
 I find out by mail in a few weeks...either &quot;yes, here is 
 your new registration&quot; or &quot;no, go turn them in and get a 
 set of crappy new ones because we want to be able to 
 read your speed by radar more easily!&quot; &gt;&gt;


And take pictures of you at intersections. 
 Mike
