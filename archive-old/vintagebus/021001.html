Subject: Re: [VB] 36hp help

Unlessyour existing major pieces are damaged in some
way, ie bad case, bad crank, super-rusty tin, you 
should be able to build the engine with what you have
on hand, plus new items such as bearings, etc.

First would be to do a teardown and take the crank
and case to a machine shop for checking.  If they
check out OK, or need to be machined, they can
do that and now youknow what bearings you need.
Oh, and have 'em go over your heads, too...

Get a gasket kit and a carb rebuild kit, too.  Plugs,
points, cap, rotor, wires, etc.  I see lots of
NOS pushrods for sale, and &quot;NOS&quot; valves seem
to be everywhere too.

The rest of the stuff can be cleaned up to whatever
degree of AR-ness you like, and put back on.

&gt; I am wanting to rebuild a 36hp for my 59 singlecab.  I have a basket case motor, extra heads, an additional case, two sets of tin, manifolds and the typical bolt on stuff.  As I collect parts how is the best way to tell if I am getting things that will be compatable and interchangable.  Is there a parts checklist kinda thing out there on the web for 36hp motors?
