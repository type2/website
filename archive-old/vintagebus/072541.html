Subject: re: shifting problems

&gt;  The pin can be changed for a bay one. Geuss how I know. The shift plate you 
&gt; can adjust backwards will make 1st and 3rd harder to engage forwards 2nd and 
&gt; 4th.  Also make shure that all the parts are seated correctly, The front  the 
&gt; Make shure that rear gear change linkage is not hitting on the cross member 
&gt; and that the bush at the front still has a bit of travel left at the end of 
&gt; its rod. New gear linkages are available from VW Heritage its the same as a 
&gt; pre 64 Beetle if my memory serves me correct. Let me know how you get on. 


Been thinking about this - I am pretty sure the new front bush is a blind hole,
whereas the old one was just an inner sleeve.  Could the shifting mechanism for
2nd and 4th on this different box need the shift rod to go further forward than
this new bush allows?  This bush was fine with the old box, but just wondering
if there is differences in the shifter between boxes.

Regards
Paul
