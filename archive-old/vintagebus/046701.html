&gt; Hello--
&gt; The chassis number is 457 113. I had no idea there was a height difference 
&gt; mid year? It is an early 59' panel built in early April and has a crankstart 
&gt; apron?
&gt; I really have no clue,  that's the first i've heard of height difference and 
&gt; the taillights were hacked w/ 62-71 lights when I got it--
&gt; could you make me a trace if that's what I need ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks alot--Pete

think you get the low version taillights- just by the overriders,  not sure of exact placement off hand, 

.. but  I find it cool that you have the crankstart apron.  Does it seem original to the bus, ie same colour (s) et al?   Because the crank handle /start was dropped, supposedly , at the end of 58, when they switched to the sturdy non-stamped bumpers.   But I had an early 59 , that had the splitcase tranny and was originally 36hp, and had the original crankstart apron.  Same sealing wax red as the engine compartment on the inside, same aqua as the outside of the bus on the outside.  (also cut for pea shooters, and the bumper had two tailpipes sticking through it- the John Muir special)  Anyway, haven't heard of anyone else having a 36hp 59 with a crank apron, and have been ridiculed for suggesting mine came with the crank apron  :(
