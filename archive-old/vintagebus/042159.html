&gt; I tend to agree here myself.  If the later, so called, I.R.S. suspension is

&gt; the 'NEW' old beetles that they sell in Mexico?

As someone who has driven both kinds of rear suspension, I know why.  The
IRS (double jointed) rear suspension is much more stable when going around
bumpy corners.  A side load on a swing-axle (single jointed) car applies
an upward force to
the transmission, raising the center of gravity.  The IRS setup does not
suffer from this fault.

After driving the IRS bug, our swing-axle squareback seemed to be picking
a new direction every time it hit a bump.

Also, if you take the tranny out, you still have wheels on the car!
