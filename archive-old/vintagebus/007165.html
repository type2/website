 In taking in consideration how to theft-proof our vehicles, a couple of
 things come to mind...

 My attitude towards the whole thing is that in the end, the vehicle is a
 thing, an object. One associated with memories and experiences, mind you,
 but all in all a thing that can be eventually replaced.  There are a lot
 more important things to worry about than to spend countless hours and
 sleepless nights wondering if your vehicle is still sitting outside your
 house.

Sell your bus, take the money you got for it (it's probably less than what
you put in to it), and set it out in your driveway and let someone steal it.
Hey, it's only money.
