Something to check is, with the hubs off, watch the shoes while
someone else steps on the brake.  Do both shoes move, and if so, do
they move the same amount?  If not, I'd be very suspicious of bad
wheel cylinders, or possibly of the non-worn shoes hanging up on the
backing plate or at the fulcrum/hinge at the non-wheel-cylinder end.

Also check to make sure that both shoes are seated down properly.
That angular wear sounds like the piston/shoe connection wasn't done
straight.  That seems less likely, because it makes it really hard to
get the hub back on.

Yes.
