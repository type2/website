The first time I rented a huge generator and borrowed an electric sawzall and skilsaw with a composite blade to clip a '67 nose. Second time rented a 12&quot; gas powered circular saw that did get the driver's side clip of about 5' x 3'. Took two blades and unnecessary butchering.  It was tough cutting the outriggers, inverted eating sparks. Most of the salvage yards around here don't allow torches. 
I found a site that sells diamond chain saw chains that will cut doorways in rebar cement walls. Anybody know of a metal cutting blade for a gas chainsaw? Seems ideal, plenty of reach for frame members and the saw itself is easy to get.
