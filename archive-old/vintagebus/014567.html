Hey listees,
	Does anyone know of a supplier of good used front windshield glass? I
craked both of mine last year trying to put new seals in :( Sort of feel like
an idiot for that, but the magazine I was using for pointers said to &quot;sit on
the front seat and push on the glass with your feet&quot;. They made a horrible
noise when they cracked, but it didn't sound like $150/pair plus an
additional &quot;crating fee&quot; worth! That price is out of the Motorworks catalog,
and I have no comparison of what they should cost. Since I live in the frosty
northwoods, finding a splitty in a junkyard is nearly impossible. Thanks in
advance...
