&gt; Yeah, when there is money in it for them they want the VW web to help them
out.  What a bunch of hypocrites.

Until VWoA stops busting the little VW enthusiast who represent not a
threat, but increased awareness and thereby increased revenue, I feel no
obligation whatsoever to assist them in anyway.  They must realize that
through increased awareness via &quot;free web advertising&quot;, they are helping
themselves.
