Subject: Re: [VB] speaking of tires

I think your right with the mid sixties guess. You
could also run Radars with Goodyear Bluestreaks! Good
luck finding a set!
 The Cal Look book has pics of some old Bug-Ins and
early racing pics that have photos of old wheel
combos. 
 Are your american racing rims wide five (vw)? That
will look sweet! 
I haven't noticed any pics of the Dc with a heater in
it yet! :)

&gt; Does anyone know when redline tires were available?
&gt; 
&gt; In my quest to date my 59 doublecab custom to as
&gt; early of a date as
&gt; possible, it's looking like the mid 60's is where it
&gt; will be due to the
&gt; American racing wheels (and the fact I don't really
&gt; like the early porsche
&gt; carrera wheels).  Accordingly, weren't redlines the
&gt; 'in thing' at about that
&gt; time?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, who besides Coker would one go to to get some?
