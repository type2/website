hi all,

friday saturday and sunday were teh first missouri bus fallout and it was
quite successful i think :)

16 people, 5 baywindow busses and 4 vanagons made it, and i got a chance
to meet a lot of new bus people who were very cool and friendly. (most of
the splitwindow guys who were planning on coming ended up having prior
engagements, maybe next year guys, we missed ya...)

Daryl Boehler showed us his neat injection tester and i must say it was
quite snazzy.  Steve lashley showed off his HUGE collection of european vw
catalogs, literature and gizmos too :)

there was a very nice 69 single cab in attendance as well, you dont see
many of those...

friday was pretty laid back as everyone was kind of rolling in from here
and there... as far as ohio and kansas city!

i was a bit late to my own campout for reasons beyond my control (detailed
in a later post) but the initial disorganization didnt seem to dampen
things at all... everyone was set up and camping when i arrived more or
less...

Saturday was a lazy day, we all sat around and talked busses and didnt do
much else.  A few people went into town, a few more people showed up, and
one guy had to head home due to prior engagements.

Unfortunately the weather has been really dry in MO as of late and there
was a campfire ban in effect. Propane and charcoal were allowed, but not
wood fires...

So being resourceful we went and purchased 2 HUGE bags of charcoal and
made us a roaring barbecue in the fire ring.  Kept everyone warm to the
point of melting peoples shoes! (and a few small chunks of magnesium
somehow ended up in there, adding a few seconds of excitement to the event
&lt;g&gt;)

sunday we wrapped it up and headed to Hardees for the final meal and
goodbyes (well quite a few of us did, a few had to head straight home.)

all in all a fun weekend, and i hope to plan it again next year. (we had
great weather this year, 60's most of the weekend.)

thanks to all who attended and made this such a fun time.

peas,

Steve
