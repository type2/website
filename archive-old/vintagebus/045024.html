 &gt;Who is competent to repair semaphores?  Mine need new solenoids.
 
 I don't know of anyplace offhand that fixes them but you might ask
 at a shop that fixes electric guitars.  They rewind pick-ups and so
 might have the wire and machinery to re-wind the semaphore coil.  To
 make it work right the wire gauge and number of turns have to be the
 same or very very close. 
 
 A friend of mine claims he re-wound his own, but he is also a
 commercial electronics tech and ham from wayback, so he's probably
 got more experience than most of us.

You can buy rebuilt semaphores for about $325 per set of two. They are 
already rewired. They are available from BFY and Koch in California. Try BFY. 
They are pretty good folks. Their number is 1-800-789-0900.
