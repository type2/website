Subject: Clutching methods

I was driving Li'l Red the other day and it dawned on my that I have not had
to adjust the clutch on him since I got him on the road in early 1997.  The
pedal is still within spec and I thought that's pretty darn good for 3+
years of off and on driving.  I don't drive Li'l Red in the winter much
because of the salt on the roads but with our mild winter, I drove him a lot
more than the previous 2 winters.

Back to the clutch thing.  I think I can attribute this to my driving -
namely clutching method.  Please don't take this as a brag (which it
isn't) - I'm just telling how I drive and you can come to your own
conclusions.  Now I don't drive like a grandma nor do I hot rod my dubs.
There are times when I do hit an extreme but the majority of the time is
just normal driving here and there.

When I start out, I bring up the revs enough to get going but when I shift,
my foot comes off of the accelerator and the clutch goes in simultaneously
(this prevents that forward lurching).  Then I shift, let out the clutch,
and just as the engine and clutch match up in speed, I give the gas again.
It's a very tricky thing to do because if you aren't careful, you get
forward lurching like a deceleration type of lurch.  Also if you give it too
much gas as you shift, you hear the engine rpms go up and as the clutch
hooks up, you hear the engine rpms go down and your speed go up.  The
slipping clutch causes lotsa wear.

So I think by drastically minimizing my clutch slippage time is why I've
been able to make Li'l Red's clutch last so long.  This bug has been to
Chicago, Denver, Kansas City, and a whole host of other little short trips
here and there and so I find it impressive that the clutch has not and does
not need to be adjusted.  I never did replace the cable either when I got
Li'l Red back in 1995 so I'm pretty stoked that I've managed this long.

I pretty much duplicate this driving style with my 67 bus and even though
you'll win no drag races with this kind of clutching, you won't be replacing
clutches all that often either.
