Cris , I'm having same problem with 34PICT3 carb on a 71 westie, It was 
running good, had just tuned up and adjusted carb and was amazed at how easy 
the carb adjusted,not being a carb guy I though I was doing good, 1/2 turn on 
idle screw changed R.P.M., Turned mix screw to obtain fastest idle and back 
in 1/4 turn, than set idle, Perfect.... I stoped for gas and toped it up. I 
got 30 mi. and than, same problem you had, no idle. I've tried dry gas,maybe 
bad gas, Have replaced 2 filters, one on tank line &amp; one on carb line. I'm 
going crazy trying to get caught up _at_ work so I can make trip to 
E.B.2001,Maybe a new carb will be easyest fix           Tom in Pa.
