I bought a locking gas cap on eBay not too long ago made by Briggs &amp;
Stratton.  I paid about 1/4 of the current price on that &quot;NOS&quot; cap.  Just
thought I'd mention it as it fits really snug and seems well made.  I wish I
could find another for my other '67!  Now it protects the Kombi from
evil-doers :-)

&gt; there's an &quot;NOS&quot; split bus locking gas cap on ebay.  My hunch,
&gt; based on the design of the stamping and the cadmium plating, is that this
&gt; is a brazlian or some similar crossover part, and would be available
&gt; elsewhere for much less.  I've seen a few of these up for auction now.
