I'm passing this on from a medical List to which I subscribe.

It's appearance on that List is timely  -  I just discovered that a neighbor
has been traveling long distances in his Westy on a regular basis while
using an unvented propane catalytic heater instead of the stock heating
system.  He had no idea he was putting his life at risk, assuming the
catalytic heater was &quot;safe&quot; in an enclosed space.

Many folks are very sensitive to CO at low levels, especially if they've
been sensitized by a serious CO poisoning episode in the past.

CO alarms/meters have been discussed at length on the VW Bus Lists.  This
might be a useful monitor, and the low ppm indication is certainly a plus.

I have no business connection with the gentleman offering these CO monitors.
We are both dealing with a particular medical challenge, and share
participation in an e-mail List/Forum pertaining to that malady.

Mr. Donnay's comments about UL-listed CO alarms/meters are a surprise to me.
I had no idea the parameters were so high.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  How can car levels of CO be monitored?  &lt;&lt;

************************************


&gt;  You can measure CO levels in vehicles with my portable battery operated
CO monitor.

It displays 5-150ppm, and alarms instantly above EPA limit of 9ppm.

The cost is $79 + $6 S&amp;H from MCS R&amp;R, ($69 ea. for 2 ).

Standard UL-listed CO alarms do NOT display CO under 30ppm and alarm only if
above 70ppm
for 1 - 4 hours.
