&lt;&lt; O.K......and what kind of welder do I need to buy?
MIG? 
Any 
suggestions......
 Think I can do this??? &gt;&gt;

If you have doubts about your welding ability, or lack
money to buy the equipment at the moment, you could
try what I did a few years back to put new heater
channels, etc, in a VW bug.  I bought the parts, cut
out the rust, and got everything ready to weld, and
then had the brother of a friend who is a very good
welder with his own equipment and experience welding
auto body parts, come out to my place and do the
welding.  I think he charged me for 2 hours work,
maybe $60 total, and did a super job.  The hard part
of the whole thing was locating the guy to do the
work.  Took lots of asking around to find someone with
the knowledge and experience who was willing to do
just the welding.  He also gave me advice on the
preparation that I needed to do.
Worked out well for me.  Next time, though, we will do
our own welding (got a wire feed welder for my son for
his graduation/ 18th birthday last year and he uses it
a lot, getting experienced).
