To the friendly an knowledgeable list members.

The Guy who helped rescue me south of san jose on 101 said my holes (see
holes posting yesterday) were for sundial.

I searched the archives re. sundial and read about the $250 tent and
Thom an look up PLF web site and the graphic for the roof mount (which
mounts with a sheatmetal screw like the kombis) was broken so i just had
a description.
the thing that puzzles me is that the PLF sundial tent had no need for
holes in the bumper overoverriders.

please enlighten me
