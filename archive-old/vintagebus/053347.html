&lt;&lt; After about 20-25 miles, I pulled into my dad's driveway and at idle, the 
oil light started to flicker. It would go away when revved a bit. The 
temperature was only about 210 degrees. After the drive back, this did not 
occur, but is had cooled outside and the temperature only went up to about 
180. Any ideas about that? &gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
Could be your oil temp guage is off a bit.  We have an old fashioned 
mechanical Stork oil dipstick temp gauge we use to calibrate our electric 
temp guages in the 210 range.  Could be your idle is set below the 800-900 
idle RPM.  Could be your oil pickup pipe is loose in the engine case.  Could 
be too small of lower fan belt pulley and/or too thin of cooling fan.  Could 
also be you have too high of pressure/volumn oil pump which is causing too 
high oil temp by pushing the oil pressure valve down too much all the time 
and not allowing the full flow through the cooler.

&lt;&gt;

Could be!  Sniff the oil dipstick next time.  If it smells of fuel more than 
oil or has a nasty acidic smell to old oil it has fuel in it and has gone 
bad.  Could be rings still need to be seated or worse your carb jetting, 
float, shut off valve and/or fuel pump are sabotaging you!
