Bah. You guys are PW.

.....

&gt; NO! Tra-rust me, keep the wife. Parts are more available/affordable. That
&gt; project is probably nearly dialed in by now, time spent under it is
probably
&gt; more enjoyable and maintenance will probably become lighter duty as time
goes
&gt; on. A good dependable daily driver is hard to find/keep.

but for bobs sake, no matter how fond you are of your bus you are DO
NOT compare the wife to a bus. No matter how hard you try you can not
explain that comparison away.
