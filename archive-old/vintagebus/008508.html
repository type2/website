&gt;My guess is that SOMEONE in KC or maybe closer has a good tranny/redux box
that they'd sell reasonable. Anyone?
&gt;

Looks like we're going to head toward KC tomorrow. Looked up relatives in
Kansas and they don't live far from KC. There about 250 miles away, By
looking at the maps I think there are some good back roads where 40 mph
would be accepted, also with some good camping areas. We're in no hurry, as
long as we can still move............

&gt;Whole thing can be done in a day even if you've never done it. You won't be
going for parts after you pull the engine, so make sure you have good/new
tranny mounts, engine oil, tranny oil, etc.


I have never taken a tranny out before, but I like to think I'm pretty
handy, so I'm not to worried, although I wouldn't mind having it done
somewhere since I still plan on making it all the way across the country and
back, so knowing that it was done right would be nice.

&gt;As for AAA, I've heard of members getting a tow, drop off, call again, tow,
drop off, call again...I think that's cheating and I don't cheat. I also
don't define morality for others. I also don't have AAA. ;)
&gt;...but I do have spare parts.


AAA for what it MIGHT save in worrying and expenses on this trip was well
worth it, but I'll leave them for the last resort plan. (it would take a lot
of towing, drop offs to get to CT)

Thanks.......
