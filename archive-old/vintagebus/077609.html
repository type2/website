&gt; Exactly!  There is even a rubber sleeve type seal to go around the speedo 
&gt; cable as it enters the left spindle.  Without this seal and the sealant 
&gt; water can 
&gt; get into the front bearings.  BTDT!  
&gt; 

Hey Guys   Wouldn't the water get in around the drum first ?? And aren't the 
bearings protected by the seal and the outside hub??  I don't see where 
sealant on the back plate would help any.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
