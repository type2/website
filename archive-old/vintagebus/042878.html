Subject: Model year question(s)

I was just checkin' out Everett's page and was looking at the chassis
dating section and it got me thinking about the model year of my bus.  The
title says it's a 1957, and the VIN is 282,XXX.  Which means that the bus
would have been made around August, 1957. 

So my questions are:  Is the August model year change the same for busses
as it is for bugs?  And if it is the same, would my bus be considered a
1958?  That also brings up questions of correct taillights (since the
original ones are long gone), bumpers, and whatever else is not correct.

Pictures of this beast will be up on my website soon.
