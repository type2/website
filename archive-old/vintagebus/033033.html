Hi Matt,
Should have the same firm feeling when you tighten them and then you need to 
loosen them about 1/8 to 1/6 of a turn before retightening the lock nut and 
bolt.  Sounds like you should take the link pins apart, look for wear and 
measure the offset to figure out the shims needed for each.  Eric&amp;Barb
