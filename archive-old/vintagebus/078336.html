Jason,

What tubing did you use and where did you get it?

How about those clamps?

It looks great!

Thanks,

&gt; thanks so much for everyone input into the questions about some of the
&gt; ways to cut tubing in a nice fashion. A few weekends ago I spend a
&gt; Saturday cutting/welding up a rack for my 66. It came out great. There
&gt; are a few things I would change now, but I'm happy with the results.
&gt; It's quite light (&lt; 15 lbs) and holds a bit of stuff. We have made two
&gt; trips using it so far and it has held on quite well, carrying such
&gt; things as camp chairs, firewood, camp stove and the like. I snapped a
&gt; few pics here:
