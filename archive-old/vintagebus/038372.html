George -- you posted to type2_at_type2, I moved my reply to vintagebus_at_type2
(*67 and earlier mailing list).

If there is any way he doesn't want this, please let me know!  I've put
active searches for a Double Cab out there... if he wants something else
(like a single cab, camper, panel, etc.) I would gladly help in a search.

As for value... if it indeed has little rust and no or few small dents ...
easily $1500 to $3000 is what I am finding.  Put in a new tranny and a solid
engine, get the brakes working and steering tight... suspension in order...
interior cleaned up... you are up to $5,000 to $6000 in value.  Get it
painted and looking real nice... $8,000+?

This is based on the searches I have found.  The only started producing the
Double Cab in 1958... 1962 is still pretty old (and of value).

&gt; 
&gt; my nephew is looking at a 1962 VW &quot;double cab&quot; bus pickup.  Thats what
&gt; he has told me over the phone.  It it minus a tranny and needs a rebuild
&gt; but only has a little rust.  He can get it for about $100.  What body
&gt; styles did the bus have that year and what is the value once
&gt; rebuilt/restored of such a bus?
&gt; 
&gt; He is looking at a tranny in a 1960 van which is sitting in a swampy
&gt; area (not real bad either).  Could a tranny be partly in water and froze
&gt; 1/2 the year and still be OK after 10-20 years?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance
