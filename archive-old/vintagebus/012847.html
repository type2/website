I hold cardboard on the off/on ramps to the Phoenix freeways. Sometimes spit
on the windshields and wipe them with newspaper. You cant believe how much
untaxable cashola that drags in. The only drag is that is *mandatory* that I
drink a few beers before going to work. If I had a straight job then I could
afford the jillion dollar slammed Hondas that all of the 17 year olds are
driving. Gotta run, rush hour friday is about to start. Time to get prepped
for work. Gotta do some heavy lifting in order to create a sweat and chug a
few pops. =)
