&gt; Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any info/tips on upholstery color.  I
&gt; think that Sundials came with either green, red, black, and maybe yellow
&gt; upholstery?  Anyway, my camper is L87, Pearlwhite.  Can anyone tell me if
&gt; this color automatically got red interior cushions? 
&gt; 

&lt;snip&gt;
I've got a NOS Sundial brochure sitting in front of me.....and here is some 
info from it. &quot; Choice of light or dark wood interiors.&quot; &quot; Sturdy vinyl 
upholstery in 15 color selections&quot;  &quot; 12 choices of washable denim curtains 
to match or contrast&quot;

In the list of accessories....&quot;&quot;This cabana and the Pent-Tent are made of 
10oz. army duck and are avaialable in 6 pleasing color patterns&quot;

There are pics of 2 pearl white campers in the brochure (color BTW).

The one on the front has Red cushoins and the one inside has green cushions.
There is only one pic (looking in from the back hatch) that shows the tops of 
the front seats.  They definately do not match the green vinyl.  It looks 
like it could possibly be the dark grey vinyl that would correspond with the 
S&amp;P edges.

Looking at the list of acc. and options ( a Full width bed is an option), it 
looks like you could custom order the color combinations.

Personally I have seen the following combos:
Pearlwhite bus with green vinyl
Pearlwhite bus with red vinyl
Velvet green bus with gold vinyl

Take a look at Mike Alcorn's (listee) Sundial sometime.  The exterior has a 
few non og pieces...but the camper interior is simply beautiful.  One of the 
only perfect examples of the dark interior Sundial offered.
