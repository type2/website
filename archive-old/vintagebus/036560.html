well the fire clean=up moves on, never realize how many parts you have
till 
you have to move them!! it took 4 of us 1 full day and 2 of us another
day
to clean and move the parts out of the showroom, at least 1000+ part
numbers
in quanities of 1 to 50! will be nice to get everything re inventoried
after
this ordeal, my thanks to stephen and his woman tristan, and to my dear
wife
for going through this hell, a special thanks to stephen for getting
the computers, printers and my network back up. the good part is i'm
getting a whole new shop out of this, looks like my grand reopening
will be during
BBB IV. but at least were back in operation now.

pics of the new fabrics will hopefully be posted by tomorrow for you
all to 
see.
