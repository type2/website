&lt;&lt; Rather than dwell on the shows that we don't like, let's give kudos and
 support to the shows that come off well.  The BBB folks always do a first
 class job, and the Bus Pilots association meet I attended in Boise was a
 lot of fun.
 
 Hmmm.  Both of these meets were run by bus folk.  Could that be the
 difference? &gt;&gt;

Maybe, in which case, why aren't you planning to come to Busses and Balloons 
in Albuquerque this weekend!!!
