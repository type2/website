&lt;&lt; Well, keeping with the fact that I am holding on to my original paint, I 
was 
 curious about the bumpers themselves. They have quite a bit of corrosion on 
 them (although not too terribly bad) and I was wanting to paint them.  
Should 
 I not?&gt; If I do, what is the correct color and how should I go about doing 
 it? Thanks for the help and opinions, they have been a great assistance to 
 me!! :)
 
     Take care,

I believe that they are supposed to be silver white, sorry bus I do not know 
the paint code for that.
