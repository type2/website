Subject: Call for Procedures

I've started a new page devoted to procedures for various bus tasks.  

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/howto.html

I know some of you have written up procedures for various things you've
done, some even have pix.  I'd love to add them to this section.  Of course
I'll give due credit and provide a link back to your site.

Thanks!
