&lt;&lt; Dan , Holly, Mike Fisher is now there 
 plus Dick is often there working on his cool cars....... &gt;&gt;

I might add that Dr. Dick is the coolest guy you could ever meet.  First time 
I went down there (I'm in the midwest) I just walked in and said &quot;Hi&quot; not 
knowing anyone there.  Dick invited me in to his special area where I got to 
see the rarest of the rare - a Hebmueller, a Papler, a Dannhaur &amp; Strauss, 
and a KDF Beetle (#187 as I recall)  My last time there I got to help him put 
new window rubber in the Heb.  How many guys can say they have put window 
rubber in a Heb?  8-)   Dr. Dick is &quot;The Man&quot;
