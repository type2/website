&gt;2) I would appear that I do not have a magnetic drain plug for my
&gt;reduction box.  This has resulted in metal flakes all over the interior
&gt;of my reduction box.  Is there a good way to get all of these flakes
&gt;out?

You might try using a magnet after the fact.  Get a dead IDE hard drive
and take it apart.  (Good excuse to buy those micro Torx screwdrivers
you've always wanted.)  You'll soon work out where the big flat magnet,
usually mounted to a steel plate, is.  These will pick up all kinds of
metallic shavings when dragged around your average garage floor, so it
might speed up getting some of the flakes out.

CAUTION: Don't get your fingers between the magnet and steel, iron, etc.
It will hurt.

A little bench testing shows that the one I have will attract your
standard 6-32 x 1/4&quot; hex head computer case screw from about 1&quot; away.
So you might be able to get some of the shavings out without getting
the magnet stuck to the box.

You will probably never get the flakes off the magnet.  The next hard
drive magnet you get, keep it clean and you can attach the magnet to
stuff that you want to be on your dash with no holes in the Bus.

If you're single, maybe toss the box in the dishwasher and let it rip.
If you're married, go down to Bob's Used Appliance, buy an old
dishwasher, hook it up out in the garage (good excuse to buy that
jackhammer you've always wanted), toss the box in the dishwasher,
and let it rip.

&gt;I'm thinking lots of clean rags with solvent to wipe down and
&gt;wipe down again until I see no more flakes...

Well sure, that will probably work too.  :)
