Hello everyone.  Thanks to Don Boneau, I know have a Royal ex2 digital
scale.  It weighs up to 4 pounds and it marketed as a postal scale.  I
really don't care about how accurate it really is, just the consistancy.  I
repeatedly weighed the tv remote and it always weighed 5.8 oz - yep - this
does 10ths of an ounce.  You can get them at Costco for around $24.99 - so
far, I'm pleased and even more pleased at that Don could help me out.  If
you want to see pictures of it, just go to ebay and search for royal digital
scales - there are scads of them going for too much money...
