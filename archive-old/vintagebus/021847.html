Subject: [VB] Converting from 9-Pin Box 
Date: Fri, 9 Mar 2001 09:42:46 -0500 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;non-(dys)functional 9-pin box controlling the signals/flashers. There don't
seem to be any replacements out there.
Does anyone have experience replacing this system with a conventional
flasher? &lt;
I am in the process of cursing at this same problem.  Check out the
www.type2_dot_com &quot;Library&quot; area and click the link for &quot;Lights&quot;.  The will
bring up a list of lights related stuff including an excellent article by
Matt Roberds on how to trouble shoot and replace the 9-pin box with a
traditional flasher unit.  
I went with basic setup without emergency flashers(can be added later).  I
went to NAPA and found a generic 12v 3 prong flasher unit for $3.99 that
will replace the 9-pin box.  I have other electrical problems, but I have
gotten the front turn signals to work, so this is effective.  I think there
are some kits that you can get from the parts houses to replace the 9-pin
for ~$70 if you want something more stock. I am cheap and the bus has been
way too expensive already :)
The stinking turn signal lever/switch was all screwed up on mine and I had
to yank it out and resolder some of the connections and clean the
contacts....  We will see if it works this weekend :)  But needless to say
this part is even harder to find than the 9-pin box and when they made a
repo(no longer available) it was $225! 
Good luck,
