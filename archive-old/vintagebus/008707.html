Be sure to try the jack out at home before hauling it along on a trip, and
be certain that the jack has sufficient capacity to raise your rig when it's
fully loaded.

It may not lift high enough to raise a Transporter, so you'll need to work
out an arrangement of spacer blocks, etc.,  to make up the difference.

A chunk of 1/2&quot; plywood about 18&quot; X 36&quot; is pretty useful to have along as a
base for the jack on soft/uneven ground.  And jackstands are _mandatory_ if
you plan to work under the bus.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  You know, I got to thinking about that, and finally decided to buy a
cheap floor jack ($15 on sale at Checker or somewhere).  I sure hope it
works if I need it.  (I don't usually buy cheap tools 'cause you get what
you pay for).  &lt;&lt;
