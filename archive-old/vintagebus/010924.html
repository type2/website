Yes, Im picky.
Im the one who replaces rather than repairs.
I rather do it right the first time than do it wrong 10 times.

&lt;&lt; Ya, I'd sure miss an event because I had a couple of windows that didn't

have the logo on them!!!! DUH!

 Sometimes I'm more amazed at the people on this list everyday! Thom, keep

that non-logo glass you offered up; If I need it to get a splitty on the

road I won't care what it says, or doesn't say on it! Don't need to attend

that show very bad do you Frankie!?
