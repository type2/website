Morning all

Thanks for the responses to the engine break in question. 
I have another. 
Monday right front wheel (drivers side here) started emitting smoke
while on the freeway. Pulled over and bled that wheels' brake first with
the hose disconned, then through the bleed nipple and drove off. Got
home and replaced all brake hoses and adjusted and bled the brakes. The
problem seems to have gone away.

My question is - what other than deffective brake hoses results in a
brake not returning (other than return springs as I've checked those) ?

Thanks for any suggestions.

good thinking that it was the hose.   when you bled it dd it squirt as much 
fluid before switch ing hoses as after?    also, I tend to check the hose by 
blowing through it-  what  a collapsing inside hose a pedal can push through 
with your sturdy leg muscles and hydraulic pressure  may easilly be more than 
allowing the springs to pull the shoes together, fitting the brake piston 
back ino the cylinder and pushing the fluid back towards the MC.    

So basically, if that fixed the symptom, odds are you correctly identified 
the problem.   :)
