Volksleagues,

I am wondering about those of you who may have a '66 or earlier ragtop bus,
(if they made them that late)

These were built before seatbelts were mandated and so they didn't have them
in even the front seats, let alone the middle and rear.  Of course it is
pretty easy to retro at least a lap belt for the front seats, and the back
seat can be retrofitted with a little more difficulty.  But what about the
middle seat?  Those belly pans are really in the way, aren't they?  What is a
body to do?

My own gut feeling is to get the mig welder out and weld a heavy (at least 1/4
inch) plate behind onto the floor behind the middle seat, with the requisite
bolts for the belts pre-installed before the welding.  Of course, this may get
in the way of leg space for the back seat unless done just right.

Two things I forgot to do before putting in those nifty Metwiz belly pans:
middle seat belt installation and routing the additional wiring for tach and
engine heat gauges.  Ugh.

Any other solutions?
