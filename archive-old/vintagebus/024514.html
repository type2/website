Subject: Oil filter pump and oil pressure

OIL FILTER
I just put an oil filter-pump on my engine and everything seemed to fit
ok (bit loose).

Is it just me or does the filter end up in probably the worst place for
it?  Right in the
flow of hot air off the cylinders?!?!?!

OIL PRESSURE
I heard from someone that high volume oil pumps can cause the oil
pressure to be so high
that it will bypass the oil cooler.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?

Thanks,
...Markus
