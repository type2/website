Subject: Re: [VB] Time switch for heater

&gt; Wouldn't a wind up timer switch commonly used for 110v AC work? Some have 12
&gt; hours, others 2 or so. They have a dial, pointer and are spring operated. Find
&gt; 'em at a hardware store. Be careful using AC equipment for DC, it's not as
&gt; robust as DC devices.
&gt; 
&gt; Might be better to figure out the Bay switch, you'll be smarter when you do.

Good to hear from Harry &amp; Rex, next thing you know, we 're gonna hear from
Erin in Nebraska (No- ????-how could I forget his handle?) or Thom

I've got one of those Bay heater switches-only about 8-10 connectors-whats
so complicated about it???
