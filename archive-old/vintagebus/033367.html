gemini_at_frognet_dot_net Pmailed us:
&lt;&lt; To make it a bit simpler..Can you get the wheels about level ?......Fill 
trans till full.....It is full when it comes out of thr filler hole.  Then 
fill the GRB till about 1/2 inch  from top plug  &gt;&gt;
Hi Patty &amp; Paul,
Unfortunitly leveling out the wheels the tranny center section will still be 
draining off about 1/3-1/2 of it's oil into the RGBs.  This draining would be 
increased in speed just by removing the fill plugs of the RGBs which would 
allow faster air movement to get out of the way of the oil.  Which would mean 
that one would be filling the RGBs while another source of oil (The center 
section.) would be filling them at the same time, and one would have to get 
the fill plugs back in before the center section continued to fill and over 
fill the RGBs.  Then after all of that one would have to still go back, and 
refill the center section again!   Eric&amp;Barb
