&gt; Where is the line between earning respect and drawing criticism?
&gt;
I have no respect for people who graft complete deluxe sections into Buses.
Worse still is the morons that make 19-windows...

Cutting, unless it's for rust repair = bad idea.

I noticed the '55 BD Kombi with the sunroof graft and some other mods is up
for sale again - $8k in Oregon.

I personally feel if you have a nice, fairly original Bus, it should be kept
stock or in a state where it can be returned to stock easily.

I also feel it's none of my business what you do.

'55 Kombi - as original as is reasonable
