Subject: Re: [VB] RE:keys for bus

List,

Dave, at Foreign Aide here in Albuquerque will cut a
key to the code also.  If you like, send me your lock,
and I'll take it to him for a key cut and send it back
to you.  It always costs me $10/ key.

JP

PS  I remember when you could go into the VW
dealership and do this!  Am I dating myself?  But,
then again,  I'm dating myself just by driving my
favorite vehicle and looking like myself in the '60's!
