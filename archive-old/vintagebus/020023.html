Subject: Re: [VB] five buses

There are 2 buses where I live, 1 bug, and 1 Avenger Kit Car (and a Lotus 
Europa and a Merkur XR4Ti, but those aren't VWs).  One bus is my '63 
Riviera Camper, the other my dad's late-67 21 window (hacked fender wells 
and a really wrinkled drivers side), the 62 Bug is mom's, and the Kit Car 
has a cherry '57 pan uncut with chevy mag adaptors and OG bias ply tires.  
Yes, dad might be interested in selling that... nelsnfam_at_pacbell_dot_net.  It 
don't run right now.
