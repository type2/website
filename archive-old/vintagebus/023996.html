.....I am looking for a source of main jets for stock VW Solex carbs.
My local VW shop and other assorted VW shops I have contacted cannot get
them for me...I was going to try BERG in the morning but thought I would
ask listees if they know of a place before I waste a long distance call
to BERG being put on hold for 20 minutes before they can tell me no they
don't have them.

Thanks. Todd S

I wonder when  folks on both sides of the Hoover fence are going to
realize they cannot convince the other side to change their views... I
just hope things clear up and cheer up on the list...its a real downer
to read all these negative posts from both sides.
