&lt;&lt; If you're worried about crushing cars here in CA there are business 
advertising for people to bring in their old cars and crush them to &quot;clean 
the air.&quot;  Just a way for big polluters to buy pollution credits to allow 
them to keep polluting.  What a racket. &gt;&gt;

There was an article in the Sacramento Bee a couple of weeks ago that my 
girlfriends dad pointed out to me and asked if I wanted to start a side 
business. The business would have been taking cars that don't pass smog, or 
are too old for smog and turning them into the junkyard for 500.00 dollars 
cash. Its a program that the state has, the car has to run, have at least two 
doors on it, have some of the glass, I think at least one bumper, well anyway 
you get the point. It has to have a majority of the parts still on it. And 
the reason it has to have most of its parts on it is not so the junkyard 
(state) can make back its 500.00, because they crush the car. They don't put 
it in the yard for parts, they crush it so the &quot;polluter&quot; will be off the 
road, and so the parts that are on it don't find there way back onto another 
&quot;polluter&quot; on the highway. All I can say is that it made me so mad, that I 
went out and drove my bus around and around and around!!!
