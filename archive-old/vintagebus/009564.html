&gt;&gt; I have heard that there is a auto insurance policy available called an
&quot;agreed
&gt;&gt; to value&quot; or something like that.  Basically you and the insurance
company
&gt;&gt; decide on the value of the vehicle when it is insured.  &gt;


&gt;AAA doesn't offer that.  The flip side of those policies is the
&gt;list of restrictions on what you can and can't do with the car.
&gt;


I got AAA to do it for Rosie ('63 crewcab). When I went into the office, the
agent told me the high valuation in their computer was $2000 for a '63 bus.
I told her I wanted coverage for $10,000. Her eyebrows went through the
roof, then we took a walk to the parking lot. After many oohs and aahs and a
half dozen pictures, she wrote me a comprehensive policy for $10,000. To her
surprise, the computer didn't puke, and Rosie was covered. The agent
recommended that I retain all receipts, take plenty of pictures and get an
appraisal from a recognized expert in the field. YMMV
