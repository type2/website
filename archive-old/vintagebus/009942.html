Subject: Re: Barndoor Front Kick Panels Wanted

&gt;     I need the front two kick panel for a barndoor single cab.  Anyone
&gt;     have an extra set?  Grey cardboard material.
&gt;
It's my understanding it's best to just make these because the holes were
drilled without a jig or anything so you can't transfer panels unless you
drill more holes.  If you do find some and decide to drill, the extra holes
would be hidden by the panel so it's up to you whether you mind drilling on
your bone stock Barndoor.

I took a bunch of pictures at SOTO of some original Barndoor Commercial kick
panels (4-pieces) that I could scan and make available to those interested.
They are 1954 so they account for the single fuse box.

Speaking of that, I have a door panel 'pockets' question.  On the '54, the
pockets are molded hardboard.  I also have a set of door panels with plastic
pockets out of a what-I-believe-to-be-stock wrecked '60 Single Cab.  Did VW
change to plastic or should I suspect that they are some sort of replacement
pocket?

'54 Single Cab - All panels intact and original!  ;)
'55 Kombi      - All panels missing! ;(
