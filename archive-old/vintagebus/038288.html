Subject: Rev limiting distributor rotor arm?

Hi list,

I was told over the weekend about an accessory rotor arm used to limit
engine revs to a predetermined level. Are these available and if so from
whom? 

My daily driver doublecab has just received the first part of a sound
reducing treatment and it is already so quiet that the sound of the engine
has ceased to scare me. By the time I have finished the under panel padding
and replaced the awful 4 into 1 exhaust I'm afraid that I will rev the thing
to death. A rotor arm might be a cheap idiot proof alternative to a tach.

Later 

Michael
