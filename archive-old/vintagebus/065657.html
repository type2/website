Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad? &gt;Photos sell too!

&gt;Sellers of vehicles and other items that are to be posted on the internet
need to pay attn to the size and optimization of the photos that they include
with the ads.
&gt;
Good luck, people try to upload &gt; 1MB photos to my site every day.  They
get rejected, of course.

For the people who ask, I tell them to upload only a couple of the best
photos and to keep them small in size.  Save the extensive detail and the
1600x1200 bandwidth-killer photos for the seriously interested parties.
