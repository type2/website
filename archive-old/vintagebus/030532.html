&gt; According to rate of conversion found at:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.celtic-vacances.co_dot_uk/m01/calc.htm
&gt;
&gt; 1 US Dollar (USD) = 116.53 Yen as of what date I
&gt; dunno...
&gt;
&gt; The USD ($) price would be:
&gt; Westy $18,707.62
&gt; Puck  $16,991.32
&gt;
&gt; Can this be correct? I am the LAST person to ever
&gt; claim being a math major so I recalculated and came
&gt; out the same. Dang!
&gt;

You are CORRECT sir!
My neighbor just got back from japan and he used the rule of thumb to just move
the decimal point two places to the left and you are in the ball park.  It looks
like the dollar has gotten stronger since he was over there.
The converter that I use regularly is
http://www.xe_dot_net/ucc/convert.cgi

hasn't failed me yet.

There are a few pages around that show the split window busses and many of them
are over 2,000,000 yen.
