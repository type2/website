&lt;&lt; Don't forget to put a battery mat under the battery to prevent further

Hi Craig,
Not a good idea.  The battery mats that we are used to have a acid nuetralizer
in them.  Which is a good idea in theory, but in the bus and K Ghia the air
intake vents allow water into the engine compartment and thusly into the
battery area.  We found this out in dry central Texas when two months later
the newly restored battery pan in my 1963 K. Ghia had the new paint ripped
open and rust started by the acid held under the battery by one of these
battery mats.  This ingress of water over a very short time washes out the
acid nuetralizer and the acid takes over and uses the mat to hold water and do
it's worst to your sheet metal.  Plus since this mat is sandwiched between the
battery and sheetmetal the mat holds water and acid under the battery longer
because it is not in more contact with the atmosphere to dry it out.  Did you
know that the VWs came from the factory with two thickish tar paper strips
under the battery?  These kept the battery from contact with the sheet metal
and allowed air under the battery to keep moisture to a minimuim.  The best
way now to protect your bus battery area is to throughly clean your battery
tray with soap and water then with a solution of baking soda and water to
nuetralize the acid.  Next paint the battery pan, inside of the tail light
corner sheet metal both above the battery tray and below with roofing tar.  If
you ever etched metal you would know that roofing tar is used to prevent areas
that you do not want etched protected from the acid used!  Then make two
strips out of tar paper to go under the battery.  You will have to use a
couple of layers of the tar paper to make good thick strips and could use a
little tar to glue the layers together.  For those with the strap over battery
hold down method you also should use a battery box for your size of battery
for double protection.  Yes, they do come in differant sizes.  Throw way the
top and cut down the sides and then you can use the strap hold down system.
Then every spring fall when you clean the battery posts you should take the
battery out with it's box and clean both with baking soda and water solution.
Just make sure not to allow the solution into the battery through the vents in
the top.  Eric &amp; Barb
