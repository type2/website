Subject: Re: [VB] How good can the steering get?

if the king pins are good too.  And no brakes are dragging.  Cruddy old tires 
will make a bus steer funny as well.  Did you do the Muir test for slop?   If 
there is slop actually in the steering box replacing the box will make it 
better,... but not if the problem is elsewhere.   Do you hear a thunk thunk 
from the box when you wiggle the steering wheel- or if your friend wiggles 
the wheel while you are under the bus?  They aren't supposed to thunk.  A bus 
can have real nice direct steering.

replace the steering box will I see a great improvement?
