Can't help myself,

Gotta write on this one (hey craig how's it going?).  Although the B
pillar is 'sheet metal'
it is folded, (spot) welded and is, for all intents and purposes, a box
section.  It is laterally
supported by roof reinforcement sections, rocker sections and dog legs.
If your bus is sound, it is really 'relatively' strong!  While it could
crumple given certain forces and moments, the crumple itself will absorb
energy and help stop you flying (in an unreduced state) into something
very hard - normally head first (and then reducing said energy with the
skull 8-(...)

The best restraint anchor for the front of a bus is a quarter inch plate
measuring 50mm x 100mm (or size to make equivalent surface area) with an
appropriate high tensile nut attached welded behind the B pillar outer
skin for a
lap sash belt (same style mounts for lower attachments).  Open a flap
and weld it closed, or open a slot higher up, put the plate in position
via a welded-on piece of wire, and puddle weld (via two holes) or rivet
in position.....weld slot closed....

These specs meet Australian Design Requirements which are *tough* and
TESTED!

I get passionate about this one...if not for you then for your family
and friends who may be in your bus.
