She found a split bus camper that she seems to be
happy with.  Her name is Chris Graue (sp?), and she's

&gt; Another issue I wonder about. As I recall, late last

&gt; The hat was passed, and folks
&gt; wrote impassioned posts about
&gt; the benifits of her
&gt; getting a &quot;bay&quot; or a &quot;split&quot;. What ever
&gt; happened? Did she ride off
&gt; into the sunset in
&gt; another bus, or what?
&gt; Does anyone know?
