Subject: Re: [vintagebus] small vs. big


&gt;if you put the little nut boxes on your trannys, you would be winding and
&gt;screaming the motor out at 60.   The truck I had with the 4.37/.82/1,39s 
&gt;was
&gt;like that.  I limited the top speed at 52.  FIFTY TWO miles per hours.
&gt;


hmmm... this could be the problem with my bus. i *AM* screaming my bus at 60 
mph! is there a way i can tell if this has been done? numbers? all i know is 
that the boxes are small nut.

thanks,
Bob Margiotti
