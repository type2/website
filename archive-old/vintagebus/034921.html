Subject: Re: [VB] rear straight axle for towing  bus with no trans ???
To: Oldscholvw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What I use for this purpose is a couple old axle tubes and reduction boxes.  
Pull out the upper bearings, and reassemble with just the stub axle 
installed.  Put them on the spring plates upside down and on the wrong side, 
and run a piece of something (I use 1&quot; square tubing) inside the axle tubes 
to keep the axles in line.  It works great, but only for getting busses on 
and off the trailer or around the yard, because with the boxes upside down, 
they can't hold lubricant.  Best thing in the world to pull stuff on my 
trailer.  I always use a trailer, cause who knows what shape old 
transmissions are in.
