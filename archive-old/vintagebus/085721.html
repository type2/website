Subject: Re: [VB] The talk about insanity...

I think it looks like a real piece of work from an artist's perception. How about a generous person who will try to get that bus back on the road for the bus' sake?
Just my 2 cents,
Dave

&gt; I honestly am not trying to say the seller is asking 
&gt; too much or that it is out of line, I really want to 
&gt; know if anyone would ever give $1500 for this bus.
