Subject: Re: [VB] VW People - Friday

Hey everyone it's been awhile since I wrote to the list. 

I think a big thing is that most bus people wave to each other as a sign of
comradarie. You don't find that with 98 percent of the people in 98 percent
of the cars these days. We all feel a kinship. I notice it with bug people,
older Porsche car people, and other very unique car people.

&gt;Yes
&gt;
&gt;    I think all Vintage VW folk know were other VW folk are in their area's.
&gt;Like you live in SLO and Randy lives in Nipomo (Junk Yard) and Mathew in
&gt;Paso Robles and on and on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been into VW's about 20 years now, 30 years
&gt;&gt; &gt; if you count the bus my Mom bought new.  Over that
&gt;&gt; &gt; time I have met a lot of VW people.  They have come
&gt;&gt; &gt; from all sorts of social and economic backgrounds.
&gt;&gt; &gt; However, there seems to be a few similarities among
&gt;&gt; &gt; them.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pack rats!  Man do these people accumulate stuff.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Non-conformist.  Even the &quot;corporate&quot; type VW nuts
&gt;&gt; &gt; are different in some way.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Fanatical.  What percentage of your T-shirts have
&gt;&gt; &gt; some sort of VW on them?  What percentage of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; walls in your house have something VW oriented
&gt;&gt; &gt; hanging on them?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you think of anymore?
