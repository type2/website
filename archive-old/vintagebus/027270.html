Subject: Re: [VB] 1960 Bus question
References: &lt;d0.33dcc68.2603c023_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt; &gt; I was over at a guys house yesterday that owns a 1960 Bus.  It still had the original transmission in it due to low mileage.  The owner said that 1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case tranny.  He reported that this was normal for the early tunnel-case transmissions, sort of an in-between thing.  I was surprised, I thought once the tunnel-case came around, all forward gears had synchros.  True or False?

From when i was working on my 60 DC.  It seams like the trany for the intermediate motor had no 1st gear syncro.  My DC had the original trany (untill i replaced it) and there was no way i could downshift to 1st W/O stopping the bus.  It also seams like i talked to Charlie Hamill about this very thing.  Too long ago to remember details but i am inclined to say that for a while they had no 1st gear syncro.

Just my 2 cents.

Matthew
