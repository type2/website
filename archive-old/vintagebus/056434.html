I drive my '63 Sundial to a different jobsite everyday. I do remodelling =
on condos here in Dallas and I my travel 50 miles or more every day.=20

My '90 Montero was my shop truck, but it developed computer problems =
and, despite large money infusions, has pissed me off one time too many. =
If it has a problem I have to put it in the shopand pay $400 to do =
anything. So it's parked. I'll probably paint it and sell it.

I am very happy after I put in a 1907 engine and a specially built '68 =
bug trans. The only original stuff under the car is the beam. I rebuilt =
all the suspension. It keeps me in the middle lane on the incredibly =
aggressive Texas freeways. I do about 65 and let the leadfoot macho =
morons pass.

I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!) and =
drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this =
month. Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their =
raingutter towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on =
top.=20

My wife has an Infiniti for when we need to put on the dog, but to run =
around for daily stuff she is growing very used to the bus and prefers =
it.

It makes fun out of driving.
