Subject: Very happy with the 3.44 + .82 combination. 78mph at 4000RPM...

Stock 185R14 metric tires. Todd Hill built 3.44 R&amp;P with .82 on my 1967
stock reduction boxes. 1967 Westy (fully loaded)...

Well, I just put 500 miles on, a good 100 of that was hard city driving in
the busy areas of Las Vegas :)  My brakes need adjusted, the tranny does
great.

It is awesome being able to run 2nd all the way up to 35MPH (4000 RPM). No
problems starting out in 1st, but you can tell there is a difference!).

Stock 1600 dual port, all I did was change to dual 40mm Kadron carbs with
Berg Linkage... this is a stock low-compression rebuild I purchased in
Sacramento (new case was the only option).  Anyway, it drives awesome.  The
bus felt like it had MORE POWER than before the upgrade (stock 1967
transaxle).

My engine heating problems are also finally solved, which is NOT related to
the transaxle upgrade... I added thermostat and vanes (everything) and
replaced my cracked cylinder head tin with proper... also made sure the fan
housing had all holes plugged.  Dropped 30 degrees off my oil temp.  Yey,
now I finally have what I consider a &quot;normal running temperature&quot; bus.  I
still need to put on a Hoover Bit (frame bracket that goes around offset oil
cooler), but these temps are much nicer.  I'm seeing 210 at 70 MPH on flats,
up to 248 when climbing a mountain at 65MPH for more than 10 minutes
(elevation goes from around 800 to 3,000 feet in about 30 miles on the last
part of the drive from Havasu to Searchlight).

I need to change the gear oil out again... as break in period is now over.
Got the Sta-lube 80-90 GL-4 stuff at Pep Boys for $28 a pail (5 gallons)...
which is a great price if you need that much :)

Thanks to Clara and Ronnie for the awesome install!

Need to work on the carbs and the belts a little... Ronnie said something
was funky with the pulley and belt, and it is really looking bad now with
the engine running (belt jumps around a lot)... and the carb is idling at
1900 RPM... but those should be easy things to fix... oh yha, got to get the
heat hooked up again too :)  Cold at night sleeping, even in Vegas :)

P.S.  Radio shack has the AM/FM/Cassette stereo on sale for $40 right now
(or at least yesterday), I installed one and no complaints.  It doesn't have
any station preset or auto-reverse on the tape deck.... but hey, it works
good and the tuner is very good.  And the amplifier doesn't have a nasty
crackle in it like my old 1970's vintage radio did :)  They also had a nice
set of speakers for $20 (on sale too) that would mount wonderful under the
parcel tray.  they come in an enclosure... and are intended for mounting on
the surface of something (like the underside of your parcel tray)...
