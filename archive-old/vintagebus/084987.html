Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and winter

Hi Jim,
That all depends on maintenance performed and how the bus is  setup.  Keeping 
it tuned up and making sure that voltage from the battery  is getting through 
the ENTIRE wiring system will make a big difference.   Just doing that we 
were able to start up in -21C (-6F) weather with six volt  system.  
  Additional steps you can take are:
To convert from 6 volt to 12 volts, and install a 6 volt 200mm clutch  
flywheel, with 6 volt starter and 12 volt starter solenoid.  
Install as big of battery as possible.  Get a battery box for it to  avoid 
body corrosion.
  Batteries are not at their best in outside temps below 21C (70F),  and 
worse well below freezing, so installing an AC plug in able battery  heater helps. 
 With some searching you should be able to find a 40 HP  and later VW oil 
sump heater that also plugs into AC.
 
  Installing a gas heater will be a must to keep warm!!
