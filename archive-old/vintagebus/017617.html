No offense, just thought it sounded like the original forwarded post was
a request for the actual Volkswagen paint color and codes, that one might
refer to as a school bus yellow, not an actual school bus yellow.  I.e. 
If someone posted, I have a '62 Bug with that fire engine red color, I'd
look up in my paint codes for one that looks like fire engine red, not
send them to a body shop that paints fire engines.  Don't mind me, just
grumpily putting off my necessary work this morning.
