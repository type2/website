Dear bus friends,

Well I finished installing the new longblock that Ronnie at type2parts_dot_com 
sent me.  If you are looking to have a new engine shipped to your door, I 
would highly recommend buying one from Ronnie.

The engine is in, and it purrs like a kitten.  Wow is all I can say about 
this new longblock.

So, here's my problem:  the generator I had rebuilt locally doesn't seem to 
work.  It just doesn't seem to put out any juice (funny, worked before the 
rebuild). I followed the procedure in the Bently manual for polarizing the 
generator, where you hook up the D+ terminal to the positive battery 
terminal and ground the other two generator terminals, to run it like a 
motor and build up &quot;residual magnetism.&quot;  It just barely wanted to spin, big 
sparks when I connected it to the battery.  Anyway, did that for about 30 
seconds (as per an archived message from Eric&amp;Barb), helping it spin the 
whole time... still no juice...

I drove it down to the local alternator shop, not unlike a scene  
deliverance down there, they poked around for a while and said that it 
doesn't seem to be working... no sh_at_t.    Now I know that I had it hooked up 
just like in the Bently manual, is there any way that this polarization 
operation could have fried it internally?  Anyone have any other ideas that 
I should try before I pull the engine? (an otherwise perfect installation, 
if I do say so myself).  This is a stock generator for my 71 westy.

please p-mail.  (I sent this to the vinatagebus list since I figure you 
folks will know more about generators and upright engines than the type2 
list, which mostly seems to be about alternators, FI, and pancakes... yumm, 
pancakes and syrup)

thanks,
Brian
