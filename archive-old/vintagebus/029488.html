Subject: My Baby is BACK!!! Yee Haw!

I'm dirtier from head to toe than a one eyed junkyard scalawag and I don't
care.  After a month and a half of peddling my a$$ around town via bicycle, I
got the rebuilt transaxle installed and out for a test drive today (hmm.. it's
1:15am.  make that yesterday and this morning.)

This was the trans that I dropped in the double cab a year ago to get the city
off of my back.  Got 2000 miles on it and 1st gear broke.  Since Rancho
Performance Transaxles is just a short drive down the freeway from me, I took
the trans down there and had it fixed and built up to withstand the torque from
the 2L type IV that I converted to upright.

Since I was working alone, I thought I'd give a try at putting the engine and
trans in as a bolted together unit. and see how that would work out.  It was
interesting and with two people, one to lift and one to push, it would have gone
much easier, but I was able to get it all in place without any problems.

The CIS FI that I adapted to the engine, just bolted in and the engine fired
right up.  Talk about noisy lifters, they sounded like a sherman tank clanking
away behind me until the lifters pumped up and quieted down.

In the morning, I have to bolt the bumper in place, fix a broken wire on the
taillight and off we go to Irvine to catch my daughter's volleyball tournament.

I guess I better go and start washing the grin off my face.

Scott
