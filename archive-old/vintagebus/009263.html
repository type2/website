Last night a neighbor dropped by with a generator problem,, His brush
springs popped out!
He's driving a dormobile.
When I leaned in to get a good look,, I was surprized to feel the heat,
after some questions, and snooping, I notices some FUZZ sticking out the
spark plug hole in the tin,,
yeeeks!   The Darn mice had made a nest in the shroud on top of the
cylinders!!
By this time, there was no more sense in describing how to replace a
generator with out pulling the shroud off!

I sent him home with a new brush holder assembly, and a bit more work than
he expected!

&gt;Maybe you have a mouse nest in there. When i was a kid
&gt;my mom took the station wagon to the mechanic  for a squeek
&gt;and he found a field mouse nest
