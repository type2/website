Matt here in Havasu had at least a 50 gal plus gas tank in his X drug
smuggler Double Cab, it came from the rear bulkhead (where there was a trap
door that you needed to remove the engine to get to) half way under the rear
seat, they even moved the filler door to the left side, must of been for
those fast smuggling gas fill ups. He never did run it empty, but could go
400 plus miles and there still would be gas in the tank. The problem with a
custom made tank, is that it probally wouldn't hold any more gas then a bay
tank, which is cheap compared to a custom tank. There is a place out here
that builds alumuinum tanks and it cost around $12.00 per gallon to build,
so a 20 gallon tank would cost approx. $240.00 to have built, plus filler
neck and sender unit, fittings and what ever extra custom fab it might take
to fit.

I know of 2 people who've done it; Bob Hoover, and a friend of mine
locally that's into baja racing.  The local guy uses aluminum and
tig-welds it.  I think bob used plain MIG, but I can't recall.
