Subject: Where is the show + swap at BBBB4 ?
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I looked at the flyer but it was a little vague.....

Is everything at the crazy horse campground ?  or ?????

If you are not staying at the campground can you drive in or do you have to 
walk in ?

dragging heavy parts out to the road does not sound fun.......

thanks for your help.........
