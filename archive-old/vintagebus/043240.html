Yes, most likely today.
I am going to place an extremely nice and complete original Westfalia rear
roof rack on eBay.
Also, I have a complete and extremely nice '68 Westfalia stand alone side
tent that has the full floor and colorful door and top, window flaps in
and out too.  Also slated to go up for bid on eBay.
FYI
later
