A friend of mine (who happens to run the bar next door, so I would like to do 
him a favor) needs a tight steering box for his 64 bus.  He has heard negative 
things about the rebuilt ones, so he would like an original one out of a low 
mile rusted/hit bus that is being parted out. Any leads? If anyone on the list 
has had good experiences with rebuilt ones, please let me know as well.  Last 
but not least, what years were the steering boxes the same as 64??  I 
appreciate any help from the list.  Thanks, Drew.
