Subject: OctoberBus/Below the Salt T-Shirts

A reminder, the deadline to order T shirts for the very first conjunction of
Buses and Renaissance recreationists is rapidly approaching.  Tell you what.
If you write on the order form that Mad Dave said to give you a break, I
will.  The shirts will cost NOT $15, but $12.50.

Where are the orderforms?  That's easy!  This link will transport you to the
very web page with complete directions on how to accomplish this not very
difficult task.

Bus content:  Octoberbus is coming soon - the weekend of Oct 13.  It will be
held at the traditional spot as Van Hoy Family Campground in Union Grove NC.

SCA content:  Below the Salt will be held in a most ideal spot, bucolic and
quiet.  Trails for the kids to check out, a creek to wade in, and trails to
check out.  I might even have my kit done by then!  Anyone participating in
the 60 bouts in 60 days?

Full Moon Bus Club:  Are we doing Burritos?  If not let me know soon!

For all:  The Grocery list for Breakfast Burritos can be found at:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/fullbusmooners/grocerylist.html .  If you want to
contribute, please e-mail snoopy at vwsnoopy_at_knology_dot_net with what you
intend to contribute.
