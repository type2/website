List:

I've received quite a few responses for the sisal rug.  Far more requests
than the amount of rug I'll have left over.  If there are any people who
would like some, let me know as we might as well only do this once.  I
can order more of this stuff and I think it works out to less than $25.00
for a piece large enough, but let me verfiy that.

If you've already emailed me no need to do it again.  I'm behind on
replying to people as I'm overloaded right now, but I have your names,
etc.  Realistically I'm not going to have time to do this for about
another month or so, but that will give people a chance to check it out. 
I'll take a couple of good pics and post them to *my virtual page* on
Thom's gallery section.  

More to follow.

Robert
