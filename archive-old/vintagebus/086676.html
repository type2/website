Subject: Re: [VB] Rebuild/Trip Report - long time coming

Hi Greg,
You really want to keep the oil temp below 230F and we prefer below 220F  
with backing off the gas pedal when getting about 212F.  So change the oil  now 
because it probably is smoked to a lesser lubricating fluid.  While you  drain 
the oil it would be good to check your sender by dropping it into a  boiling 
pot of water to see where it reads.  You will need to rig a  temporary ground 
wire from the sender to the Bus body to get it to  read.  Plus buy or borrow a 
tach for a fifteen minute drive to see where  you hit 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in 
each forward gear.
  If the temp gauge is correct, check the archives at type2_dot_com  website.  
You should look into installing some, or all of the  following:
 doghouse shroud
 wider doghouse cooling fan
356 Porsche generator pulley
&quot;D&quot; doghouse lower pulley
type 4 cooler
freeway flier tranny
 
and always that you have all the engine tin and seals in place!!
Good to hear the trip went well!!
Eric&amp;Barb
