Subject: Re: [VB] &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

He came to my house on Sunday.  Asked what all I needed fixed.  I tell him
the bolt, the center pivot bushing, wipers installed, electrical work,
clutch adjustment ... first his says the bushing and the bolt were both too
big a job for him .. then I tell him the others .. he said he was VERY BUSY
and I should contact him in a few weeks .. What kind of mechanic is this ??
Why did he bother rushing to my house ??? I told him on the phone the jobs I
needed done, and told him how urgent they all were ... oh well .. I don't
care .. I will bite the bullet and spend the big bucks to feel safe again.

Diane
