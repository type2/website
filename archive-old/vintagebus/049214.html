NQ, list
 That DC with the su-ba-roo engine was at BBB IV and looks like the pic was taken there. That's the owner to the right, we talked for a while, didn't get his name. From AZ, I think. It's been together for a few years, he likes the quiet engine and extra power. 

 If I drive my DC this year (and make it out of the central valley) I'll probably leave Thurs. morning, stay in Laughlin that night and meander down to Lake Havasu Fri. afternoon. It's easy to catch a shuttle to Laughlin from Vegas. Can haul a few souls from Laughlin and back on Sunday afternoon. My plans aren't set, but will be in a week or so. 

 In his BBB V description Kyle didn't mention the views of the Colorado river, desert mountains, spectacular sunsets, low temps of about +50, high temps of about +70, and sharing food, music,beverage with your neighbors. BBB was probably created so the hard working Arizona Bus Clubcould party without running the show.
