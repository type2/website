  Hi Friday Volks.  So the other day I'm stopped at a stop sign when I hear that
 horrid sound of squealing tires, BAMM :&gt;(  My poor trusty old 58 bug/truck and me
 went sliding through the intersection.  No one hurt :&lt;)  No Thom, no cell phone! 
   The other vehicle got severe damage to it's hood (toast).  I have a broken exhaust
 system, motor mounts and possible tranny problems, 4th gone :&gt;(
   That night we had a thunderstorm w/wind gusts to 83 MPH, I now have more dents
 to take out of my 61 Westy :^(  I hope you all have a better day than me day!
   Lou in Havasu,
 &quot;You know your in Arizona when.......
     Your rear-ended by a 2000 F$RD WIND$TAR from California&quot;. (Who then asks
           where Wally World is, %&amp;$_at_# ).
