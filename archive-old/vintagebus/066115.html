Subject: Re: got my first split, questions

&gt;I took her on the interstate and she would get fast enough to get in 4th 
&gt;gear, top speed was about 47 mph. What would cause this?? It doesn't have a 
&gt;airfilter, i'm going to get one today. Would that cause the lack of power?
&gt;


you drove *that* bus on the interstate!!! BE CAREFUL!! how are the brakes?

many things could cause the lack of power, if it hasnt run in a while... 
start with the ignition (distributor, plugs, wires)... or an early whacko 
small nut mountain tranny like in my bus :-)
