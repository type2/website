if you have the time, the best thing for removing pop outs is

penetrating oil sprinkled like holy water.  use a correct size screwdriver 
and tap the end to shock the rust loose.  repeat for a few days, 95+% of the 
&quot;stuck&quot;  popout screws I have done this with have come out.  easier than 
drilling,.and of course you do not want to drill into the threads in the pop 
out frame.
