I know how much you all hate to go on Ebay after parts. I will not list
these there then. I have a front bumper 1959 - 1967 U.S. Style in fair shape
and rear apron for Splittie. I have pictures, not developed yet though. If
you are in the area or are willing to pay shipping and are interested write
me with questions. It's not going to be an auction. At least for now.
