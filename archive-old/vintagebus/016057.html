The second hole in the front linkage is for a spring.
Make sure that you replace the return spring that is
supposed to be on the front accelerator cable linkage.
I know that Clara will say that I misspoke some minute
detail but look at the Bentleys which shows proper
location of said spring. I too fought the same problem
for months trying everything from making sure that I
trimmed the rubber seal up by the tranny/engine mating
surface and clamping the throttle tube in place from
behind the shroud to replacing the cable and being
certain of proper clearences/assembly of the cable and
spring at the carb mount point.
The problem wasnt solved until I discovered the
missing spring at the front linkage point.

Try it and see if I'm right...
