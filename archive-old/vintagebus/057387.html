&gt; it seems that we on  AOL are always missing posts, is this the same with

You'd be right amazed at the amount of mail that bounces out of AOL from
/any/ mailing list.  The servers frequently have problems with overloading
and reject connections.  AOL isnt the only one, of course, that has this
problem...hotmail and yahoo, to name a few, also do.
