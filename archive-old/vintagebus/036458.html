There is already a North Carolina bus club in existance.
It is 6 years old and is now headed by Adam Brooks and Mitch Davis.
The club is called &quot;Appalachian Split Screens&quot; and is only for split buses as 
the name states.
I used to run the club, which is the North Carolina chapter for NEATO, and 
even put on the largest VW bus event east of the Mississippi.  The event was 
called, &quot;Buses on the Blue Ridge&quot;.
I have since moved to the Chicago area, and have stopped putting any effort 
toward the North Carolins bus scene. However, if anyone would like to contact 
the Appalachian Split Screens, feel free to contact Adam Brooks at
