Subject: VW Freudian Dream... I need meds and beer =)

I must need more or less beer and meds...

Monday night I dreamed that I was driving a convertible Ghia, as I had for at
least six years during the 1980's. Married with kids at this writing but was
cruisin' solo in the drop-top boppin' to Macy Gray and Carlos D. Santana.

Was at an antique store like you'd find on a long road trip in the desert out
in the middle of F'ing nowhere or along the Cape Cod central highway. A wooden
structure with a long ranch style porch with multiple entrances, lots of
windows and lights on and a busy parking lot with many customers shopping. As a
father of a rowdy three year old, I was having appropriate amount of anxiety
dealing with all of her moods, tantrums and trying to handle everything in the
place. We are in the midst of the monster stage of which I would not trade for
a million dollars. Anyone who said that the &quot;terrible twos&quot; was the gauntlet
was full of crap. Three is the real deal. I can't wait for age four (much less
five through nineteen). Little kids, little problems- big kids... oh never
mind, we will cross that bridge when we get to it. Every time I turned around
my daughter was fat-fingering delicate overpriced merchandise of which I had no
interest.

Switch to scenes out of Northern Arizona University's Babbitt Hall dormitory
after a fresh snow.  Quite as hell, insulated by nature's blanket and low
clouds with a sense of a pending party. Flagstaff, AZ quiet and alive at the
same time with the exception of the noise of a train and the crossing signals.
Spent a few years in that place. Always wore cowboy boots at that time combined
with denim overalls splattered with clay from my studies in the ceramics studio
in pursuit of my undergraduate degree in sculpture and clay. Basically equated
to a &quot;higher&quot; education from the early 1970's. God bless Duane Allman, Wet
Willie and Jerry Jeff Walker. My friends were idiots and studied engineering or
computer science, circa 1974. COBOL for everyone. I was more into cobalt and
cone ten through out the nights.

Well anyway, I suddenly found myself driving in the Ghia, top down and
contented with the ambient light as if a winter days sunset was en progress or
clouds were promising rain. I made a right hand turn. Feeling that something
was kinda dragging the right side of the vert, I pulled over. While examining
the passenger side of the car I realized that I must have turned too tightly as
the whole side of the car was demolished! (fuggin' no-duh) The front fender was
peeled back to about mid-door and raised about two feet. Suddenly, I also
noticed that the interior of the car was rusted to all hell and the floor
boards were worse than I had previously EVER seen any VW~ much less owned.
Damn! The friggen vert collapsed into two- folding in the middle.

I was left to walk along the side of the road only to watch heavy traffic roar
by with the noise of a inner-city rush hour. Rainy weather with long hikes
between bus stops. Public transportation always seemed to rush by while I was
in mid hike, too impatient to wait for the next bus but too slow to make it to
the stop prior to it's arrival.

Switch to me looking out the window or standing on a metropolitan high rise
balcony sipping early morning coffee. As I look up-town I notice that the
skyscrapers up the block were collapsing like dominoes- progressing toward me.
Commuters were hurrying like students late to their classes. No smoke and
debris as seen in the now familiar twin towers footage. Instead there was a
generally shared feeling of apprehension as if we were all in a hurry and were
stuck at a long red light alternating with the nonchalance of a grade schooler
walking the distance to campus on a crystal dew-laden Fall morning.

I guess that I just need to hit the Lotto, buy a non-laced, natural grown
$10.00 four-finger bag as were found when Johnny Rivers' 'Secret Agent Man' had
the most reverb and was the hottest guitar on the radio, hire a tight $1000.
per day hooker, turn the sound system up to 11 with Ruben Gonzales' 'chancullo'
and anything Ray Vega blasting and submit to my suppressed calling to Christian
missionary work~ (simultaneously). I mean, Jesus...

Naw, forget that. I'm just a middle-aged white guy who needs to hit the bed for
rest prior to commuting to my redundant defense contractor job that evokes
images of the movie Brazil combined with Office Space, American Beauty
(director's cut) and Full Metal Jacket. 

Sigh...
