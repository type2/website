&lt;&lt; Hey All,
 
 This past Saturday I replaced my flywheel(just put a whole new FW that 
 Meredith kicked me)old one was GONE amazing the bus started as long as it 
 did!  Replaced the starter bushing put on new tranny boots.  Anyway for a 
 while now my bus makes a ugly noise at startup, similar to the broken crank 
 shaft on Muir's sound page!  This sound goes away once the engine is firing 
 and running, only happens while it's turning over to start.  I thought 
 getting my starter secure and replacing the flywheel would solve this it has 
 not.  Any ideas...bus seems fine once he's runnin.
  &gt;&gt;
so, nice teeth on FW,

FW and starter have matching style teeth (both either 12V or 6V) right?

starter has new appropriate bushing

teeth on starter aren't thrashed?

makes bad noise when starter running since you replaced FW?

just making sure I understand  what's up. Since it makes that noise only when 
the starter's going, it means it 's a fight between the starter and the FW.   
If all these things are good, it shouldn't make a bad noise. So somethings 
not right.  I'm wondering did you get the same sort of FW teeth on the new FW 
to match the starter.  You probably should pull the motor again and check out 
what's going on, before more damage happens.
