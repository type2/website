&lt;&lt;  Unfortunately, I found out that #4 has been helicoiled and since I HATE 
helicoiled heads ( I had one on my Westy and it was a PITA), I'm probably 
going to have to replace it.  I know old ford plugs are extra big and I'm 
wondering if I can just drill and tap the head for a ford plug and use an odd 
plug.&gt;&gt;
Hi,
Do yourself a big favor and get the solid steel insert and tools for this job 
&gt;from Time-sert.

&lt;&lt;One more question and then I gotta hit the sack tonight.  Does a 66 bus use 
a squared off or rounded engine tin in front of the cooling fan right above 
the tranny and flywheel?  I know my 71 Westy used a boxed shape piece of tin. 
&gt;&gt;
Ther round top is what you need.  Eric&amp;Barb
