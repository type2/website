Subject: Need for speed - limit

All,
I was taking a small hop over the hill from one town to the next on a short
50mph stretch of two lane while being passed constantly the entire stretch.
This is not abnormal, as in thi area most people excede the posted speed
limit as a general rule of thumb. Today, when I looked down at my
speedometer it said 60mph. I could feel the skin of my face pulling back and
could image large sections of my primer being peeled back by the hypersonic
speeds I was attaining. My problem is this:

Since traffic never follows the speed limit up here and I have no owners
manual to tell me what size tires I should have on my 67 SC, how do I know
if my speedometer was even close? Since I look like an old junker, most
people feel obligated to pass me because I &quot;look&quot; like I will slow them
down. I surprise a lot of people on double left hand turns when they expect
me to be far behind and I'm on their bumper when they change lanes on the
corner. This has caused lots of consternation with fellow drivers because I
don't look fast enough to keep up with them and force them to have to swerve
back into thier starting lane or excelerate to get in front of me (always
brings a smile to my face).

Anyway, front tire hieght is what I'm looking for I guess. Thanks
