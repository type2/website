Subject: RE: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

&gt;&gt;How do you guys with slammed buses change your rear tires?

Thom,

OK I leave myself open for a lashing, by admitting I drive a L_at_w#rd
Panelvan.  I never have trouble changing the rear tires.  My question to you
is what tires are on the singlecab?  I run 205.50.15's in the rear.  Jacked
up, I don't have trouble  removing the lugs, and removing the wheel just
requires a 'twist' as follows.

Remove the lugs, and 'Push' the rearward side of the wheel tward the rear of
the vehicle.  Once the wheel(read RIM) has cleared the drum, it will drop
down, and can be removed.  No bending of any sort.

Now if the Single cab has stock height wheels, I can see there being a
problem, but I would still think the above procedure would be better than
trying to pull the wheel straight off.

Now my disclaimer:

Being a recent transplant of the FLAT East coast, I can see why noone would
want to do without the reduction gears here on the 'left' side of the
country.  Back in Florida, it's just a straight line up and down the
highway.  No hills.

Hope this helps - K
