Subject: bus interior mirror
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi:
    Just got a question about interior mirror.  I've seen two types of early 
bus interior mirror.  One is symmetric type and another is asymmetric type as 
what I have in my 63 deluxe.  My question is when did they change from 
symmetric mirror to asymmetric one?  
Thanks.
Michael
