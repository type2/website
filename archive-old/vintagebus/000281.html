HEY Benj.
My suggestions are that you check the valves might be a bit to tight, 
therefore staying open. also you should check the compression on all 
cylinders, both a dry and a wet. find out if you have a burnt valve or bad 
rings. Thirdly if all those checked out ok then I would check the crab again, 
especially the float levels could be running out of fuel in fourth under 
load. I don't think that it sounds like an ignition prob but it might does it 
run good till you get into fourth then won't go? if so then it is, probably 
fuel, valves or rings. A compression check will tell you lots if there is a 
prob there (valves or rings). Get the specs on the float level and set it 
exact.

Hope that helps.
