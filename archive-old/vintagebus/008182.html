Today I loaded up some concrete into the Kombi that has been sitting broken
up in my front yard for a couple weeks.  The concrete was a victim of mine
and Jen's destruction of a concrete and brick planter that was blocking
access to the side yard of our house.  Mental note to self - If I need to
create a brick planter with 1-2 rows of brick, I do NOT need to lay a 6&quot;
deep x 12&quot; wide base of concrete to hold it in place.  I guess houses have
DPOs too.  ;(

A &quot;ultra-secret black ops night mission&quot; trip up to points unknown relieved
our property of the concrete and my Bus of an 750 lb(?) load.

A pic or 2 are in my gallery...

Time to wash off the face paint,
Everett
