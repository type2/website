&lt;&lt; I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an old 
transmission, and using that, but it's not real clear to me how you do that 
without having the entire transmission housing hanging out there, or doing an 
awful lot of cutting through thick metal.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
The best piece of salvage is to get the bell housing off a 1972(?) or later 
bus tranny.  This type of bell housing unbolts from the tranny case.  On top 
of this you end up with a bell housing with the input shaft hole through the 
front of it.  This hole can easily be used to mount the bell housing to a 
stand you build or even bolt it to a beam in your garage.  If you mount it 
loosely so the bell housing will be rotateable, you end up with a real nice 
setup for building engines on.   Eric&amp;Barb
