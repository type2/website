Subject: Baltic Birch Panels

Hi Volks,

Just wanted to let everyone know that I found a source for baltic birch
5X5's.  I have been trying
to get my sources together to complete the face lift of my '70 Westy.
Over the last two years I
have followed posts about the different type of suppliers but have yet
to find any on the east
coast.  Well, I was picking up some hardboard to make some door panels
and I there it was on
a little sign by the wood cutting service.  Where you ask?  At all
places Home Depot!  I was
very psyched to find this out.  The employee thought I was a little nuts
for being so excited :0)  It
is special order, but a 5X5 sheet is something like $17 .  Just thought
I'd let you all know.
