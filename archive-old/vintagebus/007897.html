&gt; My bus isn't yellow, but my kids used to brag to their friends that they
rode &quot;the Short Bus&quot; to school... I always used the &quot;Buses Only&quot; lane,
too...
&gt;
I don't know about your area but where I grew up the &quot;Short Bus&quot; was the Bus
for the handicapable (or whatever the pc word is this week).  Nothing to
brag about...
