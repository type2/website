For those of you who have an old original speaker that hasn't fallen victim to
someone who just couldn't hold back from putting their fingers all through the
paper, here is a (proven many times) suggestion that will allow you to use
your original speaker:

Needed: 

One original speaker with the paper in tact - some localized rips OK

One small can of laquer paint of your choice, preferably flat black, but
glossy colors work the same.

One can of laquer thinner to thin your paint.


First, thin the paint 1 to 1, that is, one part paint to one part thinner. 
Make enough to paint the paper.

With a small brush, paint the paper.  Make sure the paint bleeds through, and
whenever you can, paint the rear of the paper.

Let it dry.  It shouldn't take long.

Repair the rips with Elmer's woodworking glue or similar.  Don't use the
regular white glue since it is affected more by heat and moisture.

If you must (if there is a paper piece missing), use regular paper to add.

Thin another quantity of paint, but this time thin to two parts of paint to
one part of thinner.

Paint the speaker again, repairs and all.

Let dry.

Look at it closely.  See if the paint has impregnated the paper fibers fully. 
Paint some more if it doesn't.  Resist using straight paint without thinning
until maybe the last coat.

This is a delicate process, especially when dealing with the unpainted paper.

I've been successful with this even on one paper speaker that you could almost
blow the paper away like a dandilion.  It's still working today.  The paint
actually becomes the structural member with (weak) fibers.

I've tried this with enamel paints (thinnable with mineral spirits) and it
works great, too!  (Thinned the same)

Give it a try!
