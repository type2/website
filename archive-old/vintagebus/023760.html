&gt; List folk,
&gt; 
&gt; Just got a shipment of repair parts from Das Bulli Haus and along with
&gt; them came the repop washer bottle rubber top I ordered.  The bottle,
&gt; plastic ring and internal tubes were all that came with the bus.  The
&gt; repop rubber top is the correct diameter and shape, but seems to be
&gt; missing a cast in ridge that should be there so the ring can cinch down
&gt; against it and seal it to the bottle.  Right now it just falls out when
&gt; the bottle is inverted.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this sound correct?  I've not examined a original or NOS top, so

Steve, I also bought the rubber top to replace my crumbling one, is your
&quot;plastic ring&quot; a disc?  Do the tubes attach to the disc?  The rubber top
has to be stretched over it, it's tough. I think there is about 1/4 inch
lip on the rubber top that I really had to work to fit the disc.  I can
take a look at mine later if need be.
