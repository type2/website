Subject: FS 66 Std camper ad updated!
To: vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

66 Walk-thru std/camper as advertised on 
&lt;http://thesamba_dot_com/vw&gt; 
has been updated to mention the option for a SP 1600
complete*.
I originally included the DP longblock only because I
dont have all of the proper shrouding etc to
constitute a complete engine. I also have a SP
longblock, with enough fan shrouding, tin, stock
exhaust etc. to come up with *at least 99% of an
engine in that config.
Your choice of DP or SP plus extra small nutter
tranny.
Any individual *or club* interested in saving this
beast and putting it back on the street are welcomed
to call.
Call (602) 285-4693 anytime or reply to this email
address.
66 walk thru $1500 obo,
68 Buick Sportwagon &lt;VistaCruiser clone&gt; 350-2bbl
$1600 obo,
54 Barndoor $15,500. obo.
