&gt;A quick question about the name: &quot;kombi&quot;  I've also seen it spelled &quot;combi&quot;.
&gt;
IMHO:

Kombi - German
Combi - English

As in &quot;combination,&quot; because the seats easily remove via wingnuts to transform it from a people mover to a hauler.

Original literature extoles the virtues of using it at work (seats out) during the week and with the family (seats in) on the weekends.
