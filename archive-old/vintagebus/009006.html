I have been running a splitty for the last 27 years. I was able to solve the
rust problem about 20 years ago with liberal use of sand paper, Naval Jelly,
and something called Cold Galvanize Compound. The dry coating is 95% zinc
with 5% epoxy. It sticks very well to steel. The CGC can be purchased under
the brand name of Rustoleum. I think I have seen it on occasion at Home
Depot. If you cannot find it, contact the industrial supply house, Grainger.
Use catalog number 5W180 or Rustoleum model V2185. A more up to date way to
clean up the rust is to use a product called &quot;Extend&quot; from Loctite and
Permatex. You can find it at your larger automobile supply stores in quart
squeeze bottles. I would try using the CGC over the Extend. Prime, sand
smooth, (not through the CGC), and paint as normal.

TAR!  For all you folks from the Right coast, (east), remember the Ziebart
process. Before Detroit and Japan started rust proofing at the factory, it
was the only way to keep a car more than a couple of years. They would spray
the inside of all the panels on you car with tar, possibly mixed with some
other rust inhibitor. It cost a little, but the inside of your car wouldn't
rust. All the rust was from the outside in.

Does anyone know for sure what was in the Ziebart process? Does anyone know
someone at Ziebart Corp that could clue us in as to the exact mixture that
they used? Come on guys/gals, use your contacts and friends for this worthy
purpose and let us know.

12V conversions. I converted my bus to 12V in 1977/78. All I did was to
install a Motorola 12V alternator, a 12V battery and new light bulbs. The 6V
starter starts up the engine faster than I can turn the key and let go. Best
thing that could happen to a VW engine. The wind shield wipers now run at a
decent speed for heavy rain (always was a problem before). The gas guage
wasn't very accurate, always read too high but I just filled the tank every
180 miles. There was no radio, so I just modified (AAUUGGHH!!!) the dash and
installed a Pioneer super tuner/tape deck. Great reception. I have been
happy ever since.
