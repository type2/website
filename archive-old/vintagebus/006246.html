 As Ronnie stated I had a local body shop due the final body work and paint
on the 63. I welded in the rear wheelwells and the 5 camper window holes.
This is the 1st time I have had someone else do my final body work and
paint, I just ran out of time.
 There was no way I was going to Kelly Park in a primered bus and face Thom
after all the cr###p i gave him about his buses.
I can say it was well worth it. $ 1500 to finish and paint inside and out.
See what you think at K.P. This was with epoxy primer guide coated and
urethane final paint and no buying sand paper, grinding wheels, buffing
pads,  welding 24 small holes, repairing dash, and on and on. For the price,
will do it again and save the time for going to VW shows.
 Even had it painted in original turquoise paint.
 When you see it, check out the type 3 upper engine lid installed. Talk
about an easy way to change the generator with engine in bus!!!, I can
remove the engine from the top now, and pull out through the rear hatch, the
plus is the easy way to sync. duel carbs in a bus.
 Start buying 68/71 camper buses.
