Subject: Re: [VB] shiftrod hanger, Spring or bushing?

&gt; now and looks fine. When I took the shiftrod hanger out, I went to put my new 
&gt; bushing in it only to find it didn't have a provision for one. It seems to 
&gt; have used a spring clip (poor terminology, sorry)  instead. Does anyone make 
&gt; these or should I just buy a new hanger that uses bushings? 
is your bus a 50s bus?  It think the  plastic bushing was intoduced around ch #501 xxx, and the spring clip thing was used earlier.  believe you can retro fit the 'hangar', that bit the shift stick bolts to, the stick being above the floor, the hangar being below and the rod goes through a circle to meet up with the socket end of the stick.  Or you can use the 50s version of the hangar, w/o plastic bushing
