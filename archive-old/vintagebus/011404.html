Subject: EZ for me!

OK troops, glad that I could help but being Prez ain't for me. Too much of
that Monica investigation might rub off... 8P

The weird thing about my EZ camper is that the table and bed legs differ
from the recently scanned brochure. Dont fret or loose sleep if your bus
differs as well. Heck, my bus doesn't even have *any* additional lighting in
the rear. Nor does it have the scallops in the piece which runs the length
of the driver side curtains. It does have the highly textured turquoise
covering over the rear pads and rear-facing seat. Mostly primer interior
excepting the cab portion as would be typical in a panel.

I am still scrambling to get my '63 on the road. Over all I would say that
my interior looks closest to (very close to) Rick Dennis' bus~ but much
rattier at this point. It will be my Pomona parts hauler and daily thumper. 

Wouldn't you know that the VERY last nut to be installed on my 1600 DP
engine was the 13mm on the back side of the carb intake (ctr section
mounting) flange. Local SEARS didn't even have a 13mm S wrench. Did the deal
with a crow's foot and a uni-swivel. What a PITA! Now I know why I've run
duals for awhile. Lets see now, buy an S wrench or a pair of Berg reworked
Weber 48s Hmmm... PICT 30-3 it is!

I lamely promise photos of mine whenever I get it literally out of the
garage and into the sunlight. Install engine, finalize tranny and rear
brakes, then switch all of the bulbs etc to 12v. Maybe I can get Monica to
model in the photos.
