Subject: Type 2 for rent?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

A couple from NY sent me this:

&lt;&lt; question, we are flying into Phoenix on January 13th and are looking for a 
bus, camper to rent for a week any ideas. If it helps we are from buffalo NY 
and are presently restoring a 72 bus our self. &gt;&gt;

If anyone in the Phoenix area has any ideas please email them at 
Buyskes_at_aol_dot_com

Also,

I finished doing up some body work on my 67's undercarriage. Mostly 
straightening the mega tweaked rear crossmember under the transaxle (if there 
was a transaxle there) and I hope to get it on the road soon. Does anyone 
have any suggestions as for installing the side gears, fulcrums and axles. 
Any little tips or tricks that arent obvious?  Thanks
