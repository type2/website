 Well, I've seriously tried to follow the whole gear ratio thread to see if
 I can glean what the 1500 engine and '67 tranny in my 63 camper is turning
 when I'm between 60 and 65mph.  No joy...this is why I'm an english major!
 :D  On the freeway I really don't take it much over 60...sounds like it's
 running too high at 65.  Can anyone give me some numbers?
  &gt;&gt;

you havce to get a tach on it to get the numbers.   No ONe knows what gearing 
is in your tranny.  Or do that tire rotation / rpm counting thing.  Then 
correlate w/numbers oin that website.  sorry to not be helpful
