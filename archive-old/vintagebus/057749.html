Subject: Re: [VB] carb jetting - new concept for me ??

Diana,
The LONG repeat information below is saying we are very similar to your set up and
this only helped a little.  As for the spark plug check ours look good and if the
carb is too rich the should not increase heating but should help keep valves cool,
optimum jetting could increase MPG.  We continue to drive it and watch the temp
gauge.  We have now a smaller gen. pulley to give us 2.1 to 1 fan to crank ratio.
Stock is 1.6 to 1
P &amp; C
Repeat from july 2000
We cleaned the engine, welded up the fan housing, installed a Type 4
cooler, 35 mm fan, high volume oil pump, louvers and a thermostat,
throw out bearing, clutch disc (pressure plate was good), a stock oil
bath air cleaner (used my triangle bracket), new muffler, cleaned out
the fuel tank, cleaned out the crossover preheat tubes, re-torqued the
case and heads, set the valves, compete tune up (all new parts), ran a
hose from oil filler to air cleaner for positive crankcase ventilation,
and a bunch of other little things, like replacing worn hoses and tubes,
filters, air flow seal rubber, replace missing screws &amp; bolts, caulked
all the holes and a few other things &quot;just because the engine was out&quot;.

The installation of the Type 4 cooler was pretty intense with getting
all of the pieces together and installed due to stud length and diameter
changes, drilling out holes, and control arm changes for the louvers.

So yesterday we started it up, then changed the oil after 5 minutes.  Had
a little rub on the fan and we adjusted the generator and it was fine.  We
took it out for a cruise.

It was in the 90's, windy, so we went downtown about 5 miles.  When it
hit 120 deg I checked it and the louvers were open.  It got up to about
180deg - good operating temp.  It sat downtown at a block party for an
hour, then it restarted great and we headed for the freeway.  Through
town the temp headed for 180 again, then 2 miles down the freeway,
slight down hill, wind behind us, it climbed to 200 deg.

We have not taken it uphill yet, maybe this morning.

The cooler seemed clear as we pumped solvent through it for 2 days and it
had good volume flow.

Everything is sealed including the engine door, all the holes are
caulked.  No scoops!

When we installed the oil temp gauge I had checked both pressure relief
valves. (type F case)

We checked compression: #3 at 110, the rest at 120 PSI - this was before
removing the engine.

Timing is 71/2 BTDC with Vac hose pulled, goes to 27 deg full advance at
1900 RPM with vacuum line on.

Any idea what I could have missed that the temps are still going up
fast???

&quot; mentions of correct carburetor jetting  wondering if perhaps this is the  source
of my persistent overheating

Could also be wrong type muffler, air cleaner, cooling fan, relief  valve springs,
lower pulley, clogged oil cooler, too high of RPM way over 3,000 RPM at 55-60MPH,
missing cooling tin, etc., etc.....

&gt; stock, stock, stock, stock, stock, new (oil cooler),  also I don't go over 55
&gt; plus slowing down doesn't make a
&gt; significant difference, I've driven at 40mph in the desert and still had
&gt; temps over 260... cooling tin all there...
