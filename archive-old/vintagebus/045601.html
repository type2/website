&lt;&lt; after sweeping up.  I blocked the bus, got the rear end on jack stands, 
took
 off the rear tires and proceeded to have one helluva time getting the axle
 nuts loose.  The ebrake helped some but I finally ended up using a big piece
 of c-channel with a hole drilled in it.  I bolted it to the drum.  Next came
 the torch, the quenching in WD40 with thick white smoke, and then me with
 with big Bertha (5' cheater), socket, and sliding t-handle in 3/4 drive.  I
 put my 300 pound mass on the end of the 5 foot cheater and that axle nut
 would not budge!  My first attempts with the tire on resulted in the tire
 simply spinning on the cement floor.  Somewhere in all of this a pipe wrench
 sailed over my head and traveled about 10 feet - hitting the shop door and
 scaring my grandfather.  This time,  I got a beefier but shorter cheater,
 used the floor jack to support the socket, and went at it.  I jumped so hard
 on that pipe while grabbing the drip gutter with my finger tips that I
 thought I was going to break the t-handle.  My grandfather just said, &quot;I
 don't care - if it breaks, I'll just get another one.&quot;
  &gt;&gt;
eek!-   you removed the axle nuts with the wheels OFF the ground!  Scary.  I 
would always do that with wheel on the bus, on the ground, ebrake on and if 
lack of ebrake makes it neccessary, neccessay blocks.

I too have the 3/4 drive socket and have a slide bar and six foot pipe.   not 
been beat by one yet.  Done that jump up and down on the pipe while balancing 
on the drip rail thang.   BUT

do grease up the threads and splines before reassembly, and realize it only 
wants about 220 foot pounds to tighten, so you don't need to jump up and down 
to tighten it.
