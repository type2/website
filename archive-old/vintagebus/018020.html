&gt; Moral of the story: Let the kids help, start them
&gt; young, even if they make mistakes; keep them
&gt; interested.  Help them grow up to be someone you
&gt; want to leave that treasured VW bus to.

Jim (and list),

I fully agree!  My older daughter (5 years old) can
tell the difference between a barndoor and a
non-barndoor bus, as well as super vs. standard bug. 
She knows the difference between a &quot;double&quot; and
&quot;single&quot; cab, as well as what those words mean.  I
hope that I have finished my doublecab by the time
she's able to drive!!!!  We're working on double door
now, as well as bench vs. walk-through, and I'm sure
by the time she's 10 she'll know more than me and be
teaching her younger sister the ropes!

Paul
