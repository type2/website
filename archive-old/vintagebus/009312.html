Heeeeey smokin' generator!  Been there, done that, caught one on fire :-)

The first time, I'm not sure what the hell happened.  This one actually went
up.  Smoke was POURING out of the engine vents.  The local bus crazies and I
have theorized it might have been a loose winding...I took a look at the
brushes in it (I still have the carcass) and they were REALLY short.  I
wonder if that might have had something to do with it?

THe other time, it was simple.  The hot wire to the voltage reg had come off
at the connector on the regulator and was whipping around, grounding on
various things like the fuel tank.  Half the time, it sat on the connector
and worked like it should.  Difficult to figure out, but removing the
air-cleaner (to replace the &quot;faulty&quot; voltage reg) quickly showed the
culprit.  I had a bunch of those connectors kicking around in the back of
the bus, I was so proud of myself.

Anyway, maybe that helps...probably not, but ya never know :-)  Both these
exciting generator problems occurred in the Kombi.

Oh yeah, had bad vibration from the back once as well, on my old '74 Beetle.
Turned out to be a broken alternator strap.  Might check the strap on your
genny.

&gt; sand, but afterwards while sitting at idle in neutral the truck began to
&gt; vibrate pretty badly around the engine. Hard to tell if the engine was
&gt; vibrating or the tranny.  Driving her home I experienced the same
vibration
&gt; at stop lights, but not while driving.  Just before I pulled into the
&gt; driveway, I could smell a something burning... A quick check revealed a
&gt; smoking generator! Weird?  Could the generator have caused the &lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
