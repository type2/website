Kevin,
Hop on down to one of your local NAPA auto parts stores.  They sell GL-4 
by the gallon and it is made by Sta-Lube.  Its around $12 list.  Amsoil 
also makes a GL-4, but it is synthetic.  A friend of mine put this in 
his single cab I believe, but I have yet to hear the results.  If I 
recall correctly its a little more spendy, maybe double the price?  I 
went with the Sta-Lube.
I think many of you would be amazed at the parts availability at NAPA or 
some of your other auto parts chain stores.  Theres a lot of stuff they 
stock for air cooled dubs, and if they don't stock it, many times they 
can get it over night.  No affiliation, other than I buy lots of parts 
from them at work and am pleased with 99% of what they do for me.

Isaiah

&gt; I remember someone recommending swepco? tranny fluid...i have no idea where to
&gt; get this, nor have I seen the gl-4 stuff anywhere around here.

&gt; Any houston listees know where to get this? any listees know a way to mail
&gt; order this stuff?
