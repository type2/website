&gt; &gt; Silver is OG for wheels?

&gt; OOPS, It is for my '71, the last ones I painted, but not for earlier
&gt; models.  Forgot my audience!

BTW, for doing early 2-tone wheels like the ones on my bug, a masking ring
can be made easily from manila file folders.  Just tape two of them
together to form a circle when installed around the center section of the
wheel.  Paint the whole wheel the center color, let dry, put the mask ring
on, and paint the outer rim.  Remove the mask ring immediately and let
dry again.

The pros use mask rings made from sheet metal, but this is a pretty good
DIY substitute.  One ring will last for four or five wheels.
