Ok
We will try.  Not much email support traffic on the weekends and happy easter.
Did you rebuild the master? slaves?
You need to bleed the one closest to the master cyl in order of the length of line
that it takes to get to each slave cyl.
As this is done you must not have any bubbles before you go to the next wheel
Now we think you know NEVER  to let the master reserve suck air keep it to the full
line
We have to do the bleeding two person one pumps 2 to 5 times then holding the last
pump while the little valve at the slave cyl is released  I like to use a length of
small CLEAR tubing into a clear container to watch the fluid   The brake peddle
will then go down--then close the valve--now release the brake peddle--check the
master fluid level again.  Repeating until no air bubbles.
You will get more help from the others when they read this HeHe.
Not many if any ways to suck air in if the reservoir is keep full - it a pressure
system so it should only leak some where not introduce air.
Hope this helps and not a repeat of old information.

&gt; I thought I'd see if the original master cylinder (dual circuit) worked.  It
&gt; seemed to, but I think it leaks.  I'll know better in the morning.  I tried
&gt; to bleed the rear brakes.   FYI, I'm still
&gt; on the first wheel (pass. rear) and still air comes.
