&gt; Temps run 240-260 and scares me to the point of pulling over for a cool

&gt; I will soon add an oil cooler/wfan.

Hi LJ,
We agree with Clara that first you should check first for completeness of 
engine tin and seals.  Then Tach your bus for 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in all four 
gears.  You may need to install a freway flier tranny for higher MPH at lower 
RPMs.  Never go below 1,500 RPM except in first and still get above that RPM 
ASAP in first.  Only go above 3,000 RPM for short bursts, like to keep at or 
above 1,500 RPM when upshifting especially on a uphill.
  We are able to do about 60 MPH in summer 80s-90s F temps and keep our oil 
temps 220F and most of the time less than that.  All with a SP 1641 SP DR 
with type 4 cooler, wide 35mm fan and large stock &quot;D&quot; lower pulley and 
smaller Porsche generator pulley geared with a 3.875 R&amp;P FF tranny. In our 
1960 panel walk thru panel camper conversion called &quot;Nermal&quot; because he never 
was normal!
