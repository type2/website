Subject: Re: [VB] These VW motors are amazing

excellent!!!   When I got my 53 I torn the motor down and cleaned it out, and 
put in back together with new bearings,  and new muffler.  (everything was 
close enough to spec that I did that rather than getting stuff machined... the 
cranks are small enough already).  ( my first bottom end rebuild)

Point here is there was an inch of sludge in the bottom of the case.   This 
was in 92... and the tags on the bus said 66.    So If I was you, I'd drain 
that oil as soon as it gets dirty (which is probably now) and repeat as needed, 
even if it's every 4 miles, or less.    And keep it off the freeway until it 
stays clean for 200 miles. 

a 36hp sounds so different than a 1600.   amazing beast indeed!!!

Got my '53 Kombi in the winter, so really haven't tinkered with it until
spring has showed up. According to the tags the bus/motor was last running on
the road since '77.

So changed the oil, plugs,points and got rid of the stale gas. Rebuilt the
carb and lubed up the choke linkage. Then turned the motor over by hand and
without the coil connected to get the piston compression and oil circulation
going.

Moment of truth... put the ignition key in and hit the starter button. The
motor kicked in after 5-8 revolutions and away she went. It really has a very
sweet stock sound still after all these years...

Amazing!
