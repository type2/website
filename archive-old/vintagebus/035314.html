Hi Joe,
Remove the cover off the oil pump and inspect it's innerds for wear and tear. 
 If it looks good inspect the oil pressure relief valve for correctness and 
all the pieces to be thier.  If niether of these does the job then it just 
sounds like it just needs to be rebuilt.  Which is probably needed anyway 
since it is a mystery engine!    Eric&amp;Barb
