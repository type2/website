Greetings, All...
    I am seeking advise about how to clean the glass in the 65 that I am
working on. The bus was pulled from a field here in Oklahoma after
sitting 28 years and the glass has a crusty coating on it. The coating
is a slight whitish hazing that resembles lime deposit in a shower.
I tried using some household cleaners with minimal success.
Is there a product or procedure(polishing, etc.?) that will remove the
coating and clear the glass up again?
