Subject: Re: [VB] Georgia collection of 20 VW's all for $2000.00

&gt;Easily triple your money at the next swap meet. 

I disagree.  If what happened to old Beetle prices when the New Beetle 
came out is any indication, you could probably dectuple (? 10x) your
money.  Just get a storage place in sunny Arizona and haul all the
loot there and lock it up until the New Microbus comes out.  After that
you can sell each Bus he mentioned for $7000 (regardless of condition)
and you've grossed $21k*.  Of course you have to cover the haulage and
storage costs but some of the Bug parts should do that.
