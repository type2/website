&lt;&lt; Has anybody out there driven a 40 HP 1500 plus miles on a single 
journey??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
We have lots of experience with 1300 big bore HP engines driving from Seattle 
to LA and back.  The single refief cases run alot lower oil pressure than 
dual relief cases.  Even with the installation of a dog house cooler and 
oil/filter pump on a SR case it is easy to get a flickering oil pressure 
light (About 7 lbs.) at idle after pulling up a long uphill in 85F weather at 
3,000 RPM with 30Wt. Castrol.  Had to drop to 2,800 RPM up the next hill to 
lower oil temp about 20F from 210F to get about 10 lbs higher pressure.  
Pretty sure the bigger oil pickup tube makes a large differance in the amount 
of oil pumped through the cooler and bearings per RPM.  We have a 40HP engine 
case that we have machined a later larger pickup tube into for a future 
engine and tests.  Tried 20-50 Wt. Castrol but did not like how easy it was 
to hit 80+ lbs. in only 60sF weather on starting and the cooler it got the 
more the pressure became a problem.  Seems it acts more like 50 Wt. when cold 
and we got the same pressure readings as the 30 Wt. at high outside temps.  
Unfortunitly 40 Wt. is real hard to buy up here in the NW.  Eric&amp;Barb
