Subject: Re: [VB] Speeding, Cooling, and Over-reving

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; What you all don't realize is that I have dual external oil cooling.  I
have an external radiator mounted on the left side louvers, and I have oil
seeping out of every seal on top of the engine.  The oil atomized throughout
the engine compartment is definitely cooler, though getting it to re-enter
the crankcase has been a problem.

Major misconception in the VW communities is that adding oil coolers makes
the engine run cooler. Don't assume just because your oil temps are in line,
that your engine isn't running hot!
