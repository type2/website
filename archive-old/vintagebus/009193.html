Our 1970 Campmobile had a rear-facing jump seat with a low back, identical
to the one in our 1968 Campmobile.

Our 1970 Campmobile has the drop-drown lid above the icebox and under the
sink.

Our 1968 had, and our 1970 has, a stainless steel sink.  The pumps were/are
identical.

We were the 2nd owners of the '68, and are the 2nd owners of the '70.  Both
were/are unmodified, equipped exactly as delivered from Westfalia.  Both
vehicles were produced late in their respective model year production runs.

Westfalia and VW were both sloppy about illustrations and text in their
various publications.  The best [worst?} examples are the VW Owner's Manuals
and the Westy Campmobile supplemental manuals.  I have the factory original
manuals for our '70 Westy.  Most of the Westy manual illustrations are
incorrect for our vehicle, and some of the photos and text in the Owner's
manual are incorrect/inaccurate.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  It may be an even earlier vehicle (I think this has come up before).  If
you look closely at the square side marker lites, its possible that they
were airbrushed in.  This is especially apparent if you look at a hard
copy of the brochure.

Jumpseat behind driver is the low-back kind (when did they switch to
highback - 70? 71?).

Can't see the sink well enough to tell which variant we're looking at
but it appears to be the steel top rather than the plastic that was on
my 68.  Also has the drop-down door above cooler, rather than the drawer
-- again that's 70?  69?  &lt;&lt;
