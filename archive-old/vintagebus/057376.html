Subject: Re: Westy in Hot VWs

Thanks Lou and Scott for the compliments.

I heard the issue was out, at least to subscribers.  I still haven't seen it yet, but then again, I guess I just need to walk out the door and lift the bus cover.

Hope to see a lot of you at the Summer OCTO/Classic weekend.

Robert
