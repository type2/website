Subject: Re: [VB] bay beam under a split

Less maintenance with ball joints instead of  king pins. Disc brakes 
pretty cheap if you want them. Wide 5 bolt wheels are possible with 
adapters but that comes with extra headaches. You'll have to have a shop 
cut and turn the torsion bar tubes to get a stock height. I like them on 
my '63 double cab, but I haven't driven very far on stock front beams. 
One person's opinion.

&gt;I've heard of people putting an early bay beam under their split... what is the benefit of that? Better ride or something?
