Don't think I have ever seen a round one in a 53' but 54/55 yes for
sure......There is no rime or reason,but it has always been to me that
the 'Square' is more correct looking.I did pull a round one out of 54
ambulance before.....My 53 Samba and my 54 Samba both have 'Square'
corners,BOTH of these buses are VERY ORIGINAL.I believe out of the 6
Sambas I have had ALL have had square but it has been some while and the
memory is starting to fail abit! I do have a 'extra' round one that
could possibly be for sale or trade
