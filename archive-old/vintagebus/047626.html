    i am having some problems disconnecting the motor from the transmission.

it has barly been out, if at all in the last 41 years. the bottom two bolts

are easy and they can come out, the problem is the two bolts that you have

to take out of the top. they were really tough to start but when they

started, they got real easy. it was then that i realized that they were

spinning in place. i then went under it and looked for the back of the two

bolts, but i coulnt find them. so, i was wondering if anyone else has had

this problem and if so, what they did.


i had no problem taking the motor out of my 69 (except it took a week

because it was my first one) but the rear setup is very different in the ten

years between my two buses, which i learned really quickly when looking for

the rear brace under the 1200cc.

-----------------
the problem is that the top two are nuts and bolts, which means you have to 
hold the one end whil eyou undo the other side.   The earier buses do not 
have the locking bolt on the starter, which means put a vise grip on the nut 
in tthe engine compartmnet, then go under the bus with a ratchet, some 
extension, and a 17mm socket, and assemble the tools till the ratchet clears 
the starter, and undo that top left bolt.   

on the left side you put the vise grip on the forward (tranny) side, and undo 
it from in the engine compartment.

there is also a nifty tool with two ears and a place to fit the 17mm hex 
head, which is held by a magnet.  if you attach this to that forward end on 
the upper left bolt it holds the bolts from turning.

I recommed putting the lower nuts back on, undoing the  top ones, putting the 
jack unde rthe motor, then undoing the bottom ones.

Also get your idiot book handy and read the engine removal section
