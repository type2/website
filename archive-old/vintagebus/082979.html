. Finally a guy from Regina
&gt; Saskatchewan emailed me and said he will do a set for $225 in Ashe or Oak
or
&gt; maple  including shipping.  He is offering a 15% discount for group buys.
he is
&gt; sending me some samples so I can check them out. Is there anybody else
that
&gt; wants any of these and has anybody else ever dealt with him before.  &gt;
