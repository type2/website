I guess  mine is 1 3/8&quot; tubing, I just saw it is also  available with 1  1/2&quot;
tubing, what does the larger tubing get  you?



Hi Kevin,
Better breathing if you have a 1776 or larger engine, run with dual big  
carbs, and push your engine as a norm way over the revs that will give  you engine 
longevity or good gas milage.  If you are planning to run  your bus as a 
daily driver and not drag race it, the stock muffler with stock  heat exchangers 
is fine up to 1776 sized engines.  
  Take a good look at the graph in section M-30, page 5, in the  &quot;Workshop 
Manual Volkswagen Transporter&quot; 1963-67.  This graph is for the  1500 engine, but 
is simular for the 1600.  Torque is only at its highest  just above 2,000 
RPM, and by the HP hits its highest mark at about 4,000  RPM the torque has 
fallen way off.  Torque is what you need for a daily  driver bus.  Focusing on HP 
only is bad for a daily driver  bus.  Also if you try and drive your engine at 
4,000 RPM you will have alot  of engine overheated problems.
  One of the projects we want to try sometime is to run a 72 or 74mm  stroke 
crankshaft (more stroke = more torque, but too much stroke the pistons  get 
shoved via the connecting rod into the top/bottom sides of  the cylinders) with 
1600 P&amp;Cs.  That way we should have much better  torque and increased CCs and 
not have weakened the engine case by  boring the cylinder bores bigger.
