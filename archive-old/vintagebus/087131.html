&gt;Hi Hermine,
&gt;
&gt;I figure that if the gas can make it past the 2 filters, whatever is 
&gt;left will make it thru the carb, burn in the cylinders and make it 
&gt;way out the exhaust. Have you ever seen the filter in the tank? Its 
&gt;pretty fine. Never seen anything in my pump filter either. I have 
&gt;cleaned it (there wasn't anything actually there to clean)  a couple 
&gt;times over the years.

i may have been traumatized, but the stuff they sucked out of the gas 
holding tanks in my neighborhood, man, you coulda used it for asphalt 
road topping!  and what gets caught in the plastic inline filter, 
which I never not use, is annoying enough! normally I do not even do 
housework, i am obsessed only by the cleanliness of my cars and 
things like cowboy boots. You should not get the wrong idea. which 
is, although I want things very clean, i do not seem able to even 
DUST. unless it is a car.
