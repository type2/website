All this discussion finally brought to mind the following...

Go to http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties/ and follow the Journeys link. 
There is a scan of VAGs &quot;Technical Reccommendation for Journeys Under
Difficult Conditions&quot; there.  This will give you the factory reccommended list
of spares and tools.  For a journey across the Sahara.
