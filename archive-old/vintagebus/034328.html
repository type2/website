Hope someone can help me figure out what my master cylinder is on my 67
Deluxe walkthrough (vin 257076396)

First, the existing (bad) master cylinder reads &quot;VARGA 25IND.BRAS.VFCC 
IR 3066  0025-6&quot;.  Don't know if that will even help.  I don't have a
Bentley yet (would that even help?), but the parts catalogs I've looked
at say I should have a single circuit (one line coming out of it) master
cylinder.  The one I have has two lines - the front line T's off to the
two front wheels, the rear line T's off to the two real lines (T is by
nose-cone).

I've heard of people converting single-circuit brakes to double.  I
guess I need to know if this is stock or not and maybe a good parts
outlet to get a new one.

the dual circuit brake system was standard on buses from CH# 217 019 on
certain models (my source is somewhat confusing on this) and from 217 227 072
465 on all LHD models.   

Which tells me your bus came with a dual master cylinder.  I think new Varga
ones run about $130.   The 67 dual circuit master cylinder is different that
the 68 ones, and is unfortunately significantly  more expensive.
