Subject: [VB] compressor size question

Could some one point me to a 115v compressor that can be used to sand &amp; paint a bus? How much cfm or scfm will I need?  The random oribal sanders seem to want 10+ cfm _at_ 90 PSI &amp; someone told me I will need 18+cfm to spray paint.  I have sapce for large compressor but my landlord will not want to deal with me if I go asking for 220V to be installed. I just need some starting point to work with. 
thanks in advance
