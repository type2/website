&gt;So not only was barnoor spelled incorrectly, the items

I've also found that some people have no idea what a Barndoor is. 
They hear the term and think it applies to all split window busses. 
They refer to the cargo doors as &quot;barndoors&quot; a lot of the time. So, 
they might not be lying, only woefully uninformed.
