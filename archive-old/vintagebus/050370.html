&gt; If you use the electric choke you will need to install a 12 volt one.

Eric 6 Barb,
in my 61, the diameter of the 6 volt choke is smaller then that of a 
12 volt choke. As I understand it, the only 12 volt chokes that will 
fit are from the early 12 v ambulances and other special utility 
vehicle. Making this a very rare (expensive) component. Unless you 
know of a source of small 12 volt chokes?
