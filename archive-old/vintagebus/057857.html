Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] Tools at Everybus (Snap-on)

Ted, I certainly wasn't jabbing at you. We hung out for a couple of
hours at EB 2000 (I think) after I broke the cam leaving the campsite.
You're of the nicest people I've met, and an honest business man.

I was sort of jabbing at Snap-on. I've got lots of tools (I make a
living working on VWs), only a couple of them are Snap-on tools (and
they are my favorite tools), but they are *very* expensive. Maybe it's
just envy on my part.

I apologize if it seemed like I was jabbing at you, TBear.

david
