Subject: How could I forget?

Hey Volks

In my trip report earlier this week I forgot to mention the
MOST important thing:

During our difficult drive home from Cape Town, the
Ratmobile (1975 Fleetline panel) and I celebrated 100,000km
of driving together (that's 62,000 miles for the metrically
challenged).

That means that about one third of my total splitscreen bus
driving has been behind the wheel of the Ratmobile.

Interestingly, my main road tripping buses were the ZebraBus
and my Dormobile, and most of my driving in the Rat has been
urban commuting since we first got together in January 1993.
