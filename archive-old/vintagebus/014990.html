Subject: Camper content on my '64

OK. I'll be going through my '64 conversion today and need to know if
anybody needs anything off of it. I'll be bringing it back to it's
original state I think and just want to know if another bus needs any
camper parts from it. Main thing would probably be the back bench because
all the panels were home made and these would go - garbage.

Thanks.
