Subject: what dizzy is this?

Hey volks, thinking about trying a vac adv dizzy on my '60 bus to see if =
it gets better gas mileage (17 mpg hwy) and I found a dizzy I had on my =
'74 bug for a while, till the 009 took it's place. I _think_, not for =
sure, that it is a svda, but I dunno. I don't know the whole part number =
on it, but I do know that the last three digits of the part # was 070, =
which I think is what most people go by as the dizzy number (like the 009) =
It has a vac canister with two outlets. Does anyone know what this is used =
for? Is it safe to run on my engine (1600 dp 34-pict3), or does it need an =
adjustment to work, or is it adjustable, or can I just bolt it on and =
enjoy a cooler running motor that is getting better gas mileage up the =
classic next weekend?  :-)   Thanks for any info as I would surely like to =
install it if it is for the better. -Mark &amp; Tiffany '60 EZ Camper, '60 =
