'67 was a one year only dash, and the radio opening is larger than
earlier years.  So it will fit, there just might be some daylight
around it.
I did see yesterday a '67 Sundial Camper with no backup lights and an
earlier dash opening. ????  Guess it was an EARLY '67.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a 67 Sundial (with back up lights) with a production date of
Aug 66, and I have had a couple of people mention that I have the
'small' early dash hole. My bus is all original. 
Maybe someone knows just what are the dimension of the radio cutout
holes by years ?
I'm asking for the info because I am looking for an original AM/FM
Saphire radio for my 67 camper.
Thanks for the help
