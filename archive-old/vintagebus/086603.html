Subject: Re: [VB] VW Microbus Assistance

Hi Corrie,
First off you need to figure what year of Deluxe Bus you really want.   The 
21 window was built from 1964-67, while the 23 window was  built before that.  
Once you have that figured for  sure.  You can purchase the &quot;Workshop Manual 
Volkswagen Transporter&quot;  for the year you have decided on.  
  The Bus body/frame is built as a Uni-body so there is no  separate frame to 
find.  
  As for after market parts, it depends greatly.  Most of them  are pretty 
cheesy, and the engine stuff is more likely to end you up stuck on  the side of 
the road.  Reproduction parts on the other hand, for the most  part are pretty 
good.
  We prefer getting any VW untouched by an unknown to us  restorer.  It is a 
lot easier to rebuild the suspension and engine than to  deal with some ones 
screw ups.  Doubly so with body work.
  Buying a Bus and just getting it running is a good way to  go.  Then with 
studying up, doing research (in the archives  on type2_dot_com), going to lots of 
show and swap meets to explore, and  asking lots of questions, you can find 
what you want to do, and how to do it  properly.
  As for joining any club, the lists on the type2_dot_com, and  Thesamba_dot_com, 
will be better for info and parts than any club we know of.   Though any local VW 
clubs can help a lot with support, and info in your  area.
