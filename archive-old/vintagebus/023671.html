Kevin,
	I believe it's time to get that VDO electric oil pressure gauge and
sender for your bus... The stock oil pressure sender light comes on (I
think) at 6 psi or less of oil pressure, warning you that your bearings
are about to become toast.
Possible causes:
Too light a weight of oil.
Oil clearance problem... caused perhaps by line bored case, excessive
clearance between bearings and the parts that turn within...
Overheating... engine gets too hot, viscosity of oil drops way low.
Problem with the oil pressure relief valve and/or oil control valve.

I would first drain the oil out... and while doing so remove the oil
pressure relief and control valves and clean them/reinstall, checking
for proper movement and crud on them and up in the passages.
When this is done, I would (after bolting oil strainer and sump plate,
gaskets, etc. ) refill the oil with a 20w50 weight... Castrol? It's what
I usually use, no affiliation with them...
Engine air seals around compartment are OK?? Fan not blocked by crud? 
I would then start it back up and have a way to check the oil
pressure... I believe it should be 25 psi with the engine warm, at
idle... initially it will be higher when engine is cold.
I'd also make sure when under there that the little air deflectors are
on the bottoms of the cylinders... or the kool tins, whatever you have.
Other... timing should be set at no more than 28 to 32 degrees of total
advance... at 3,000 rpm, or the engine will overheat. (yes, I know it's
&quot;correct&quot;, but I have to throw the timing stuff in... protocol)
You are using premium gasoline all the time, right? (necessary with high
compression engines, I assume...perhaps it's just that old &quot;conventional
wisdom&quot;, but that's what i hear)
Leaks in the fan shroud will also contribute to overheating, so seal 'em
up if they exist. (those little plastic things that hold the spark plug
wires, etc.)
It could also be a problem with mixture... running too lean under a
load, maybe? Valves wrong clearance? dunno...

That's all I could think of... perhaps I have left something out... just
wanted to cover all the bases.

Hope it helps.
