When I rebuilt the front beam on my bus (new parts everywhere possible plus
a rebuilt steering box from bus boys) I was out about $1000 in parts and
expenses.  I took the arms off of the beam and removed the springs so I
could pull out as much of the old grease in the beam as I could. Ronnie told
me that those bearings in the beam hardly ever wear out of they've been
lubed and I lucked out that mine were.  In order to keep sand from getting
in the beam, I used some wood block scraps, scraps of bike innertube, and
some threaded rod.  I drilled one hole in each of 4 blocks of wood.  Next I
ran a length of threaded rod through each of the 2 torsion housings on the
beam.  I put a hole in each of 4 pieces of bike innertube just slightly
undersized from the threaded rod.  I slid the inner tube on the threaded
rod, then the blocks of wood, next 4 large washers, and then some hex nuts
to sandwich the whole apparatus together.  This was successful enough to
keep the sand out of the beam while it was blasted.

As far as I know, you can't rebuild the steering box.  You can replace a
seal on it that Ronnie should have (references a SAAB part # and I was able
to get it from my flaps) but unless it really grinds or has slop you can't
take out, there really isn't any need to get a new box or even rebuild it.
Just drain out the old grease and put in some new.

All the new tie rod ends and so forth that I got from Ronnie were sealed
units so I drilled them all out and added zerks.  I now have 19 grease
fittings in the front end of my bus.

I also had the wallerd out swing arm lever so I rented the tool from bus
boys, pulled out the old bushings, put in the new, and as a result I have a
really tight front end.  Even people that have driven it compliment me on
how good it feels.

Keep those beams lubricated folks.  Factory spec says every 1200 to 1500
miles as I recall.  So far, as much as a PITA that it is, I have.
