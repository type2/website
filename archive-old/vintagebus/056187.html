Keep in mind that a 67 has a different sized dash opening for the radio.

I've noticed that many retailers/sellers on Ebay state that their products,
(not only radios either) will fit up until 67, which was the last year of
the split window bus.

There were many one-year only features on the 67 model.  Keep this in mind
when purchasing master cylinders, door handles and locks, radios, and lots
of other parts as well.

Doesn't matter how good a deal you get on a part if it won't fit.

&gt; If you need a modern radio there was a thread a while back about a Radio
&gt; &gt; Shack model that would fit in a stock hole in a bus dashboard (check the
&gt; &gt; archives) - downside was that Radio Shack was closing out it's auto
&gt; &gt; radio products and you had to grab one while still in stock.  Don't know
&gt; &gt; if it had that 'retro' look, though.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I've got one of those.  Fits great and with no mods.  Cost all of 20
bucks.
&gt;  Works about like you'd expect a twenty dollar radio to work.  You need a
&gt; good antenna maybe a booster.  The stations don't seem to lock that well
as
&gt; its not a digital tuner.  Output power is very low too, but when you're
&gt; just running a stock speaker up under the dash you don't need much.  That
&gt; said, all busses are noisy.  If doing it again I spend for a better tuner
&gt; and more power so I could hear it with out distortion.
&gt;
&gt; But hey it was only 20 bucks!
