Subject: Mystery oil&amp;gas leak
Mime-Version: 1.0

I need some help pinpointing some leaks on my Volksie.  It seems to be
leaking oil but there are no oil spots on the driveway.  So my guess
is the pushrod tubes, can't be around the oil pressure switch because
I already fixed that.  It seems to loose oil at high revvs.  I looked
underneath with a flashlight around the cooling tin and I can see some
black sludge around the end of one pushrod tube where it meets the
cylindar head.  How can I fix this with ease?  Can I remove the
rockers and push rods and break the pushrod tubes off then install the
type of pushrod tube that has a spring so it can retracted and easily
installed with new gaskets.  Or would anyone advise strongly against
these because they might leak also.  I know the engine doesn't burn
oil because it never has and I had a compression test.  This was
noticed only recent.  And there's no way to know for sure where all my
oil is going...
It also seems to smell gas on start up.  After its been driven after 5
min the smell is gone.  The Gas smell doesn't seem to be acumulating
in the luggage compartment where the tank is.  My best bet is the fuel
lines underneath the luggage compartment where the electric fuel pump
and filter are.  My question is, if the connections or lines have been
leaking only under pressure wouldn't it smell of gas constantly at low
speeds around the city?  Why should it clear up after a few minutes.

TIA
