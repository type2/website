&lt;&lt; - there are five wires coming out of the chassis.  Two brown ones are 
paired and must be the speaker wires.  One wire has a fuse - that's 6V+ in.  
One is plain black, that's ground.  One is long and yellow/brown and has a 
funny tang on the faston connector at the end -- that's dashlights, right?&gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
Correct!
 
&lt;&lt;- are there separate bass and treble controls on the outer knob rings?  
They both seem to move rheostats.  It ain't balance &amp; fader. :-)&gt;&gt;
Only the left should be the bass/treble control.
 
&lt;&lt; Right now mine does nothing, except the dial lights when either the fused 
or the yellow/brown wire has juice and the switch is on. ?  Both conditions 
require grounding the black wire.  Chassis ground seems to do nothing. &gt;&gt;
Sounds like time for a rebuild!   Eric&amp;Barb
