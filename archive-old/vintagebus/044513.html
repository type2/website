&lt;&lt; Once again Jason has a question.....actually 2.  #1 When I'm driving and I
 let off the gas peddle the bus pulls to the right, if I'm driving and
 instead of letting off the gas peddle I push it into neutral it doesnt.  The
 guy who I bought it from said that the tranny mounts need to be replaced, so
 far he has been wrong on everything he has told me so I'm not going to take
 his word without hearing it from the experts (thats you guys).  Anyways I
 dont want to listen to anyone who solves leaking axle boots by wrapping Duct
 tape around them.
 
 #2 Where should I go to get a new muffler and what kind ?  Also the rear
 bumper has cut-outs for dual exhaust but the muffler that is on it runs down
 the side and spits out the rear drivers side.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
#1 Check to make sure that the reduction gear boxes are bolted tight on the
rear swing plates.  
#2  If you are going to race your engine over 4,000RPM consistantly and/or
your engine is over 1641cc then you are going to need a header muffler.  If
you want much better MPG with a 1641cc or smaller engine and longer engine
life.  Then by keeping the RPMs to between 1,500-3,000 then the stock bus
single tip muffler will do just fine and outlast the header mufflers by twice.
It sounds like a bug muffler was installed at one time thus the holes cut into
the rear bumper.  Bug mufflers will give you carbon monoxide poisioning to you
or your passengers, so stick with one of the mufflers that gets the exaust out
to one of the rear corners where the slipstream of air will carry most of it
away.
