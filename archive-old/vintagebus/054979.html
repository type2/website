Subject: Bus won't start

So I went to start my but this morning and it just sort of clicked.  I =
was able to jump start it later so I figure the battery is not charged.  =
I was noticing a bit of static coming from the amp so I'm wondering if I =
may not have a short somewhere between the fuse box, 8-track, and amp. =
My battery is a Walmart battery - cheap like borsht and 2 years old so =
maybe it's just cooked.  Or, maybe my battery is not getting charged. =20

Any ideas appreciated
