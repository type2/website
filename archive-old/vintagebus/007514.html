&gt; Now on the part of POR 15. Did you just use their regular paint but tinted
&gt; for spraying or something else? It's kind of hard to sand this stuff once
it
&gt; dries. How are you dealing with this problem Gene?
&gt;
&gt; ANdre

Andre/List...

As far as the usage of POR-15, I used it as a primer for the engine
compartment, the right side rear wheelwell area, and the entire roof.  That
stuff spreads like magick, so a little went a long way.  I only had a quart
of the silver, and I still have about a fifth or so of it left (including
the rock-hard covering it has made for itself).  I sprayed it in the engine
compartment, rolled it (very thinly) on the roof, dabbed it into the
crevices of the gutters, and foam-brushed it onto the wheel-well area to
prime and hold down a whole lotta filler.

As far as its finish qualities, I dust-coated it with primer after it seemed
almost cured, and as a matter of fact, if you put on too heavy of a
&quot;dust-coat&quot; and/or too soon, it bubbles...watch out!  No, you don't want to
find yourself sanding POR-15!  The only area I had to do any of that was on
the wheel-well area.  Just a few streaks, though.  Since I am priming with
that high-build surfacing primer, I am not experiencing any problems.

I'll say this:  Wherever I put POR-15, I feel totally confidant.  It grabs
like you wouldn't believe, and, if dusted at the right time, primer becomes
one with it!  During this project, I have performed several
experiments.....some I'll withhold until either the paint lasts five years
or more, or it just falls off.....we'll see.

It is strange, though...this bus was rescued from a junkyard, had rockers,
front floor, cargo floor, nose parts, wheelwells, a dogleg, etc. replaced,
filler crammed into the countless places it seems like someone took to the
whole body with a deadblow hammer, and the whole time I see what it's been
through, and here I am giving it another who-knows-how-many-more years, and
I feel somehow connected to the people who have owned and fixed her in the
past.....

BTW....if anyone wants to guess how much waterproof, fiberglass-impregnated
filler it took to make that dogleg match up with the door, I'll send the
closest guesser a chunk when it falls off.....(that's the pessimist in
me...)

See ya down the road (one of these days!)

Gene
