Subject: problems installing rear window on double cab  help  help

--part1_3c.164fb91f.294fde75_boundary

hey all ,

I have tried three times to install the rear window and It won't go in it 
seems that the seal is to fat . I ordered a seal from ronnie for a truck and 
it is the same as the bus one .  SO WHY CANT'T I GET THE WINDOW TO SEAT WHERE 
IT SHOULD ?
I have installed several windows with no problems but the rear window of this 
truck seems to be a big struggle.  any one have any hints or suggestions.  I 
am using soap water and a string around the seal. But it is just to big to 
get inside the lip.
help please    John  65 double cab
