Subject: Orange DC in San Jose

The '63 orange doublecab I've been driving daily for 5 years is now with 
a new owner in the San Jose area. He'll keep some of the orange and add 
a two tone scheme. It was a good truck and made many trips to shows in 
addition to the daily drives. I hope to see it again. Four vintage buses 
have shared the driveway with it, a '60 DC, a '65 21 window and a '66 
camper, now there are none. Next project is to finish the '74 Thing and 
sell it to make room to finish the '79 Deluxe Westy.
I inherited a farm truck from my father-in-law, big enough to tow a bus 
with it's propane powered V8. Oh, and it's orange/yellow too.

Here's an amusing toy, www.googlism_dot_com, with output for &quot;Volkswagen&quot;. 
Try it with your name.
