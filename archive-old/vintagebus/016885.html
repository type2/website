as for miles per gallon..I get about 18-22mpg. I know my mileage goes down
when I drive too fast on the highway(over 65). I have a '65 bus with a 1600
engine in it. 6 volt. 200mm clutch.(not really sure which of these would
effect mpg) I can't remember which carb I have. I have been planning on trying
electronic doohickey in the distributor, supposedly better mileage.

hey all, i have a couple questions...
i have been driving my bus for almost 4 months since the snow stopped flying
and have a few questions. (1) im only getting about 17 mpg, whats the order of
things i should check to improve? carb? points? plugs? my mechanic says thats
ok, you guys all seem to get 30!! :) (2) this is puzzling to me... i have a
small nut tranny in my EARLY '66 converted to 12V. while cruising down the
freeway on this newly paved stretch (flat) i look down and im doin' 70, easy.
she doesnt even seem to be over revving. i need to hook up my tach. she is a
bone stock SP 1500 that runs strong with a new 31-3 delivering fuel.
