Hey all!

The show today was a success!  A little hot, but no rain.  There were
91 entries in the car show and many winners.  &lt;bus&gt;There were only
about 6 splitty Buses in the show...two regular Standards, a Standard 
with pop-up camper, a Standard with Westy-type camper, and a couple
of single-cabs.&lt;/bus&gt;  The swap meet was well-equiped and well-attended
too.  I will have some pictures up on the Web in a day or three and
will announce the URL then.

We are still adding it all up, but we did raise money and awareness for 
Meals on Wheels, Tulsa Scottish Rite Reading Disability Clinic, and
M.A.D.D.   Thanks to all the participants and sponsors who helped make
the show a success!

Don't forget the upcoming shows that other area clubs are putting on,
in Fort Smith, Arkansas; Enid, Oklahoma; and (I think) Oswego, Kansas!
