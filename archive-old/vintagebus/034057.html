Subject: Re: [VB] wiper motor wiring part 2
To: rickd_at_socket_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

so is your 63 12V or 6V?  if it is 12V I would look for a 66/67 wiper switch 
and then you can turn it to low or high and have the self park hooked up.  
and look at a 66/67 wiring diagram as to how to hook it up, cause it is not 
like a 63, as you know.  

the front part of the wiring is sepaarate than what runs to the rear.  you 
may want to replace it if it is that bad.

    Ok, I've got a 12V 67 wiper motor. It has 3 wires plus ground. When I put
 12 V on the high speed I get 12V fed back through on the park wire (a big
 assumption that it is the park wire on my part). and 7V on the low speed
 lead.
    When I put 12 V on the low speed and I get 12V fed back through on the
 park and high speed leads. Is this normal? According to the wiring diagram
 for a 67 all 4 wires are hooked up to the switch. Does the switch handle
 this feed back voltage somehow or does it just not go anywhere and dead ends
 on the switch.
    There are a lot of original wires that are melted under the dash. I don't
 want to take a chance and melt the replacement ones already there. Right
 now, everything works except the rear blinkers. But I don't think the rear
 blinkers are hooked up at all.
    The original flasher relay has been replace with an after market one.
