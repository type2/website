Curt,

I just installed a 1776 in my bus with a weber DFAV progressive carb. I
assume that you have about the same. Do you know the jetting you have
installed? Mains and air correction? I was running the carb on a 1600 and it
was always rich. I don't know what the jetting was. My mileage was around 18
in town and about 20 on the highway.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt; Anyway, my best mpg was down to Moab a last month, 30 mpg, uphill back
&gt; home I got 24.  I think my highway ave. is about 26-27.  Thats what I
&gt; get overall on the trip between here and BBB.  Worst was around town
&gt; with the progressive tuned rich (since corrected) 18 mpg.  Around town
&gt; now I get about 20-21.  All this will change later this month when I put
&gt; dual 36 Dells on that Art Thraen (Ace Engineering) up in SLC is
&gt; rebuilding for me, hopefully my mpg's will improve and I'll run a tad
&gt; bit cooler.  Hope, hope!
&gt;
&gt; Okay, let the knu thread begin.  Mileage, in town, on highway, engine
&gt; size, stock/mod, setup, whatever you think is pertinent.  Then maybe we
&gt; can begin to see a pattern that can potentially be beneficial to the
&gt; group as a whole and to the individual pocketbook.
