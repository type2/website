&gt;I looked at Thom's wiring diagram and I can use it if
&gt;I debug the system myself with a voltmeter.

So what are you waiting for?  :)

&gt;But the colors don't match up.  I have a solid green wire, 
&gt;a solid gray wire, a solid blue wire that come directly out of
&gt;the harness that I don't know where they go.

Follow the harness out of the engine compartment, over near the
starter, and forward until you can find the place where these
wires were spliced on to the originals.  At a guess I'd look
right near the starter - this would probably be about where
you'd splice it if you'd had an engine fire.  I don't see where
those colors (except the blue as you noted) would be in the
engine harness of a USA or Euro '64.  There are some wires 
with those base colors but they should have dots or stripes of
some other color on them.

&gt;Is there a special way I need to read the wiring diagrams?

Start at the + on the battery and follow it from there.  :)  The
colors on the diagrams should match the colors in your car - as
far as I know there aren't any secret codes or translations.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
