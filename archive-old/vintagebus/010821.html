&lt;&lt;&quot;Did you check the bolts to the spring plates?&quot;&gt;&gt;
  Yes, nearly threw my back out tightening them down.  And the lock plate 
ears bent over as well. &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
Undo the lock plates and leave them that way for the first thousand miles 
after installing the tranny.  Retorque/recheck the RGB bolts every 100miles 
and after the first thousand miles lock them with the lock tabs.  Eric&amp;Barb
