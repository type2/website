Tim,

For the most part yes.  The ring and pinion is on the
opposite side in the Type 2 due to the reduction gears
and the ratios for 3rd and 4th are different.  Also, the
ring and pinion ratio maybe different depending on the
year of the donor trans. 

Type 1  3rds (1.32- early / 1.26 late)
            4ths (.89)

Type 2  3rd - 1.217
            4th - .82
