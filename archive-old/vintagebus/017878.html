Well, the general methods are:

* jam your knees under it and whack the shaft with a hammer (the steering shaft, that is, can you dig it?)
* a real steering wheel puller
* get lucky and have it pop up the second you take the nut lose (it happened to
me once)
* remove the nut, and take a long leisurely drive down hwy 1 or some other
curvy road - GUARANTEED to remove the wheel.

BTW, I had another box rebuilt (it was going to go in the '55) and I'd munged
up the threads pretty good getting the wheel off.  Wolfgang was actually able
to fix it.  I was impressed!
