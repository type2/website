Later buses have 80mm heater tubes on the bus and earlier ones have 60mm 
tubes.   This changed around 64ish.
Heater boxes also came in 60mm and 80mm diameter
originally your buses had heat tubes, heater boxes, and connector tubes all 
the same size
I reality, you may have a mismatch.   I have seen engine with a big tube 
heater box one side, and a small diameter tube the other side.

There are adaptor thingys that are tubes 60mm one end and 80mm the other, 
Seems like you have an 80mm bus and engine, and some 60mm tubes.

Can you find 80mm tubes at your junkyard?
duct tape used copiously can also work, but you get twice the air flow with 
the large tubes (Area = pi r squared) 


&lt;&lt; My bus doesn't have any heat. ...
  There aren't any heater tubes connecting the heater boxes to the bus.
so I went to the junk yard and got some mufflers (they look like big hot
 dogs) and some short slinkly looking metal pipes that connect from the 
heater boxes to the mufflers.
 That didn't work. The muffler opening is smaller than the opening of the 
heater ducts on the bus and the slinky pipes are smaller than the heater box 
outlet holes.
 
 I'm stumped. Can anybody tell me or point me to a picture of what I need?
