&gt; I look on the vehicle ID tag and then determine the

I would have to consider that a restoration to
original specs but NOT an original specimen. The
&quot;upgrades&quot; weren't done by VW even though the upgrades
might be NOS it isn't (in my opinion) an original car.
  

 It's the after market accessories and 6 to
&gt; 12 volt conversions and bigger engine swaps that
&gt; mess up an original show car.

For safety reasons, i wouldn't consider a 6 to 12 volt
swap that destuctive to a cars originality. I do
however, agree with your comment on the instalation of
a larger or different size motor. It would fit into
the fact that the engine is not the original that was
equiped with that car.
