Wow!  That's a class III hitch!  I wonder how long it will be before we
see a splitty showing up with a big Airstream behind!  :)

Seriously, you might want to consider a more modest receiver if you are
planning on selling this hitch to the general public.

When my father was having a wheelchair lift mounted to a Ford Taurus, I
found out very quickly that the only hitches available were class II.  Not
nearly strong enough to handle 250 pounds of wheelchair and 100+ pounds of
lift.  I went to several custom hitch places and explained what I needed,
but none of then were willing to build a hitch with a class III receiver
because of liability reasons.  &quot;What if you sell the car and some
idiot tries to pull their boat with it?&quot;  Although this was frustrating at
the time, I can see the point they had, particularly since they are very
close to California, the litigation capitol of the world.

Luckily my father had a neighbow who was a retired metal fabricator with a
fully equipped shop (as in a metal shear that handles 1/4&quot; steel!) and
together we built the Class III hitch from hell that filled the bill
exactly.  You could have dangled the entire car from it!

I still wouldn't have towed a big trailer with it, but then again I knew
better.
