Subject: Re: [VB] 1:1 reducSpeeds and Revvs (reply to all posts)

&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever heard of replacing the gears in the reduction boxes with
&gt;gears of equal size (i.e. 1:1 ratio)?

&gt;I've heard of the concept, but don't know if anyone has actually made the
&gt;parts.  I believe there was a good reason why it would be a PITA to do, but I
&gt;forget what that reason was.

It was spelled L I A B I L I T Y.
