I remember about 2 or 3 years ago at the VW classic, the shoe company
&quot;Simple&quot; had their concept  bug - er sorry i mean &quot;new bug&quot;. It had been all
across america and had a cam mounted on the passengers side out the window.
They had the US drawn on the door and put a magnet on each state they had
been thru. Almost had it filled up when i saw it....dont see anything about
it on their site though - although he did sell his shoe company shortly
after that. I heard he bought a 23 window with some of the cash
