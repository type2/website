&lt;&lt; But I called and this kit is discontinued. Does anybody have a mail order
 source for the reamer and the bushings for a 34-3? My wife's bus is leaking
 from the accelerator pump linkage.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
We had the same leaking problem on one of our engines.  After checking for
proper fuel pump rod hieght, and installing a new float shut off valve to no
avail.  We finally replaced the float in the carburetor and low and behold
the fuel stopped leaking out right after the engine was shut down.  The old
float looked perfectly fine and had no fuel in it, but apparently was too
heavy for some reason.

Here is some info we found on the net.  Eric&amp;Barb

Carbureted Volkswagen Idling problems
Idling problems that can not be adjusted away, try spraying some brake
cleaner on the throttle shaft of the carburetor. If idle speed increases
you have just found your vacuum leak. If carburetor leaks at the shaft,
the two possible solutions are to either replace the carburetor or have
bushings installed in your old carburetor. I suggest replacement if
available. Vee Dub Parts can install bushings in your carburetor or
supply you with a new carb. Bushing of your carburetor costs $45.00 per
carburetor. New 30pict1 round float bowl carburetors cost $99.99, 30/31
square bowl, replaces all 30 and 31 pict carburetors with square float
bowl, cost $109.99. New 34pict3 carburetor, replaces all 34pict3 and
most 34pict4, costs $149.99. Other carburetors will need to have
bushings installed. Be sure to check all manifold attaching points, you
may have more than one leaky area. Dual port intake manifold boots are
especially prone to leakage, Don’t be fooled by their looks. Vee Dub
Parts has new silicone intake boots available at $2.50 each.
