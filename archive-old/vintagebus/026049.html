While talking to a fellow VW Dub owner at a show my wife ask him, so how
many vw's do you own, he says 8, my wife says how many run, he says 2,
she laughs and he says I can't help it, they just follow me home, my
wife says that's because you have to pull them home!
So why is it we had rather buy that old bus that has been sitting under
the tree out in the back yard for 10 years, and hey the motor ran when
we parked it, for $500.00 instead of the one that someone is driving
daily for $1,5000. Is it a theory we feel compelled to save it from a
slow return to the earth, or is it a conspiracy by a third party to keep
the sell of parts and equipment flowing?

Since the last of our busses came off the production line over 32 years
ago and had been in production for over 25 years, at some point people
had to refer to them as, &quot;one of those old vw busses&quot;
So is it a theory that when we see all of the DUMB PO things that have
been done with our beloved busses, is it because you could buy one of
those busses with that big hatch thingy in the back for $150. or one of
those with all of the windows and that big sky light in the top for
$200. ? Some folks even said, hey buba I bet I can put that old V8 in a
bus, wanna watch me! Or was it that conspiracy thing again?

And then of course when you make the decision to buy that beater bus,
the one under the tree with the windows shot out for $700. because the
rust isn't that bad and it has potential. Then the next day while your
at the FLAPS getting all the brake hardware and gas lines and tune up
parts and so on and so on, you notice a beautiful 64 Westy pull up, and
old gentleman and his wife get out and walk to the counter, as you pay
your $300. or more for your parts you hear the man ask, we are looking
to sell our bus, we bought it new and have kept it in the garage, have
all of the maintenance receipts, would $1,599. be to much to ask?

Have a good weekend
Meredith
