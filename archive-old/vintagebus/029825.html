&gt; I have just saved a 66' camper with reduction gears. I have a complete set of
&gt; Porsche 912 IRS parts. I have two Porsche 901 (902?) transaxles. The delimma
&gt; is HOW to make it work???

I can't remember if the 912 trailing arms work or not, but regular IRS
bug trailing arms work perfectly.  And it is easy to find the front
brackets for the trailing arms too.  Then you have the luxury of cheap
bug (I recommend type 3) brake parts too.

As far as the 901 gearbox, not a problem.  It will fit with many mods. 
I would recommend that you mount the trans as far forward as possible,
so as to ease the engine installation.

My 901 gearbox, along with 2.0 911 engine are actually too long to make
a good installation without moving the torsion tube forward.  The fan is
actually flush with the rear of my crew cab.  The decklid was cut and
inverted to clear it.

If you run a 912 engine, you might want to run small tires.  My truck
does about 34mph in 1st gear.  That might be a bit much for a 912!
