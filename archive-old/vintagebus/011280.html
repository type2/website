Hi Eric, Christy, and Miranda,
Sounds like you need to get a screw driver with a square shaft.  That way you 
can put this type of screw driver into the screw and push as hard as possible 
on the handle toward the screw with one hand.  Then turn the screwdriver with 
a wrench on the square shaft.  Best to turn it toward loosing the screw, if 
that still does not work try changing which way you turn back and forth it to 
see if you can get it to start to budge and work it free.  Eric&amp;Barb
