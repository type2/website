Subject: E-mail charges - hoax
Message-ID: &lt;19990603162506.29063.qmail_at_nwcst312_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Please disregard the message I sent about the E-mail charges.  It was pretty
irresponsible to do that in hindsight.  One, I wasn't supposed to send stuff
like that to the list, and two, I didn't check it out first.
