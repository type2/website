At our club meeting last month, a fellow SV2s member brought ice cream bars for all. He was testing out some dry ice in his icebox. They were coooooold! Frozen solid! You may have to insulate your food somehow to keep it from freeeeeezing.

 &gt;I remember you had some dry ice in your cooler at everybus. I'm getting
 &gt;ready to do some camping in the heat of the summer and I was wondering
 &gt;about this dry ice trick. How much do you use per cooler? How long does
 &gt;it last? Do you use regular ice with it? (I'm betting you do) How much
 &gt;regular ice do you have to buy to keep the cooler filled?
