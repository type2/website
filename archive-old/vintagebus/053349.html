&lt;&lt; I realized there is a fitting on each of the emergency brake cables in the 
rear, right where the cable comes out of the metal tube in the body.  How 
much grease
 should I pump in there? &gt;&gt;

Hi Brian,
Just a couple of pumps each every 3,000 miles.  This is to not only lubricate 
the cables, but to push/displace out any water that might get into the 
cables.  Make sure to install the rubber boots on the front end of the cable 
body tubes to help keep out the water also!
