Subject: Re: Restore - frame and floor rot

What used to be considered OK years ago is not-so-OK now. For example, 
in the 80's there was a guy in Corpus Christi that sold fiberglass 
front floor board panels to cover the rust beneath your feet. I saw a 
Thing in Port Aransas that someone had used a Stop Sign fiberglassed in 
over the rotted front floor. Stuff like this makes it really hard to 
sell a car nowadays.

As far as frame rot goes - unless you have money to burn or are 
restoring a very early deluxe (and you have money to burn), run away as 
fast as you can.

Check out Kelly's site (www.metwiz_dot_com) for info on replacement panels. 
Also good to see what is involved with replacing those areas.
