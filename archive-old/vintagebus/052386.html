Subject: Re: Fort Wayne :( :( :( :(

Bart,
  Because busses should not sit for long periods and  
since I am a kind hearted soul, always giving - I 
volunteer to drive your Sundial while it awaits your 
return. Understand that I am just looking out for your 
bus' best interest (besides, my wife would rather camp 
at BBB6 in a sundial than in a double cab)!

Hey Listees!
    Bart Daugherty here and I am gonna be stuck here in 
Fort Wayne, IN for 
awhile.  Staying at a corp. apt. for now, but have to 
find a house this 
week.  My sundial is being stored in Fresno till the 
salt is gone or I may 
just leave it there and fly out for the shows.  Any VW 
ppl here in Fort 
Wayne????  I have  seen a few beetles and a couple of 
rusted out bays, no 
splits though :(  Well have fun in Havasu, gonna be in 
Nashville that 
weekend.  My wife wanted me to sell my bus?  You believe 
that?  Anyway after 
a year or so I think I can make it to the west coast, 
this is one of those 
career building moves.  Gonna miss all of you.
