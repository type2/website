&gt;&gt;  Our 62 has a shoulder mount, at least on the driver's side. Does this
mean  someone added it?  &lt;&lt;



Hi John,
If it is only on the driver side, then it was added on.  We would be  worried 
that a reinforcement plate was not installed by who ever did that.
  We think that the earliest shoulder seat belts were installed by the  
factory in the 1967 model year.
