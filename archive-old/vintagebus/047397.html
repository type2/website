&gt;  
&gt;  This weekend I went down to San Diego to pick up something from Dave 
&gt; Gillingham (thanks Dave) and experienced some overheating on my 6K mile 
1600 
&gt; DP motor.  This motor had been running like a top for the last year and 
made 
&gt; the 900 mile trip up to KP/RB with no problems!  This motor never ran more 
&gt; that 200 degrees even at 70mph in warm weather. I just adjusted the valves 
&gt; and had recently futzed with the carb and timing to try and cure my 
&gt; incureabel flat spot
&gt;  
&gt;  
put the flat spot back. where it was.  It is very important to have a flat 
spot on an engine with a 009.  The factory installed those spotsin the dist 
for a reason.- to keep the engine cool.  they let the heat out through a 
wormhole into space.  so it has to be adjusted properly or the heat will stay 
in the motor.
