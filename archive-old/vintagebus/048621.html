Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;  There goal is to have some parts made to unvail at the Classic this year,
&gt;they have asked me for cargo floors as they feel there is a big demand for
&gt;those.


I don't know how others feel about the subject, but I like to use paint
locked galvanized metal for all body repairs.  With good air circulation,
it welds in nicely.  You don't want to breath too much of the fumes, it
will make you loose your memory, or something, ................I forget.

The great thing about galvanized, you don't have to worry about the rust
returning and the paint will stick just fine.
