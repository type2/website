Subject: Re: [VB] Church Keys On Airplanes

I was stopped in Tampa.  Was in a rush w/ an impact wrench in my bag (long 
story don't ask).  Well they stopped me had me open my bag had a look at it, 
called the supervisor who knew what it was and sent me on my way, with my 
Gerber multi tool in the other bag.

&gt;Rob,
&gt;    A story I heard was a traveler was recently relieved of his disposable 
&gt;razor at the x-ray area. He walked down the concourse to his gate and 
&gt;stopped into a shop and bought another disposable razor!
&gt;    A church/bus hatch key might look like a tool to open an aircraft 
&gt;door/hatch/panel, don't blame 'em for taking a second look.

&gt;I like the phony &quot;final&quot; picture.

&gt;Last year when Erin and I flew in to Vegas to attend the Lake Havasu show I
&gt;dumped my pocket stuff on the little tray at the X-ray machine and the
&gt;ladies there asked about the church key on my key ring.  I told her that it
&gt;was to open the gas tank filler on a old split window bus.  She went and 
&gt;got
&gt;her supervisor and she asked me what it was for.  I explained to her and 
&gt;she
&gt;thought about it for a minute and then let me pass.  With the heightened
&gt;security I doubt if a church key is the kind of thing that you want to have
&gt;in your pocket.
&gt;Just a heads up to let you know.
