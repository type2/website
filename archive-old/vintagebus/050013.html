&gt;&lt;&lt; I want to put a gas gauge in my 59 double cab (don't worry, I'm not going
&gt;to
&gt; cut the dash) but am curious about the sending unit.  I'm not interested in
&gt; swapping tanks either. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi David,
&gt;Unfortunitly if your tank is original you will have to cut and drill holes in
&gt;it's top to allow the use of a sender.  Which was a dealer modification, that
&gt;VW supplied blueprints, and instructions on how to do.  You might want to
&gt;reconsider just installing a later tank instead.  Doing so is quite a bit
&gt;safer due to less chance of blowing or burning yourself, and you could
&gt;install a 1967 hump back tank or a post-1967 tank for more fuel capacity.

Hey, what's this &quot;1967 hump back tank&quot;??  I ran out of gas in my '66 once
in less than 200 miles.  The stock tank is way too small.  Is the '67 tank
bigger?

TIA,

Kabayo
