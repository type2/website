Hi all,

Sold this seat, but shipping to the guy in Canada was $400.
Ouch!  This was mostly due to the fact that I live in a
small, out of the loop town.  Its a front solid bench with
new oatmeal tweed upholstery.  Price is $100, price of
upholstery, seat is free.  I am located 4 hours north of San
Fran on the coast.  Any locals need it and want to come and
get it?  Have pics.

Gerald
