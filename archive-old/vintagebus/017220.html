&gt; I have just spent 2 frustrating weeks attempting to
&gt; remove the tar like
&gt; underseal  that coats the underside of my 67 bus.
&gt; Chemical stripping has been futile as the coating is
&gt; so thick.
&gt; Heat/scraping has proved to be excruciatingly
&gt; slow,messy and unhealthy due
&gt; to fumes and skin contamination.
&gt; I have found the fastest solution is to use a blunt
&gt; air powered chissel to
&gt; remove the bulk of the material and to then soften
&gt; any remainder with some
&gt; kind of tar emulsifying solution and scrubb off with
&gt; steel wool.
&gt; Go easy with the chisel and keep the tip at an acute
&gt; angle to prevent metal
&gt; deformation.This method is still slow,very noisey
&gt; and still messy.
&gt; The ultimate  solution appears to be sandblasting.I
&gt; just got a local company
&gt; to test blast a small section of chassis rail with
&gt; great results.To do a
&gt; thorough job engine needs to be removed and all
&gt; undergear removed also.
&gt; Of course all the original primer will also be
&gt; removed but most companies
&gt; offer a galvanised zinc coating application for not
&gt; too much extra.
&gt; Hopefully my bus will be blasted next week .I'll
&gt; post my final verdict then.

If you are using POR-25 to coat the underbelly, do you
have to remove all the old protection? my
understanding was that POR-25 is pretty much
inpenitrable, therefore, you can slap it over the top
of anything, becaise water won't get through there
anyway. i can see where it would be beneficial to
remove most of the flakey pieces that are almost
already off, but do you have to remove all of it?
