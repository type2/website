OK
Here is a long shot but I will ask anyway. Since I have not been able to
find a westie hitch for my bus I am in need of a way to get more stuff from
point A to point B. More specifically from Tacoma, WA down to Cannon Beach
OR for the week of July 1st through the 7th. I am hauling three kids and two
BIG kids with me. Of course I will also have to have everything from the
house to include the kitchen sink (gotta keep the wife happy ya know).
Anyway I was thinking a rack would allow me to get some of the stuff out of
the bus and on top of it. I can't really afford to buy a nice westie rack so
I was wondering if anyone local either would be willing to loan / rent me
one for the week, has a beater they will sell for cheap or if someone has a
set of Yakima rack legs that fit a bus that they would be willing to sell
me?
Anyone???
