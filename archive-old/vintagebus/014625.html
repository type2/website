&lt;&lt; I have seen some of you volks talking about the latest VW Trends magazine.
 Does anybody subscribe to it? I haven't received it yet and have seen it at
 the stand. Does it mean that my Mailman is going through it first before
 dropping off at my mailbox?
  &gt;&gt;

My Dad subscribes and I often hear the same complaint from him.
