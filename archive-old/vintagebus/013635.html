Thanks for the reply Jason, a lot of really great info there I hadn't 
considered.   Now that you mention this, I spray painted the entire engine 
compartment, including--taking off the voltage regulator and painting behind 
that (funny, I don't remember it not being painted back there).  It never 
crossed my mind I should sand that paint off so that regulator could 
ground... I bet this is the problem, while they were poking around, they 
said that the voltage regulator didn't seem to be working, then we took it 
off and put the regulator on their test stand and it worked perfectly, much 
to their bewilderment.  They said the generator was working great when it 
left and they test every rebuild before sending them out.  I guess what 
really spooked me about this place today was their testing procedure, which 
seemed to mainly consist of taking a live wire off the battery and randomly 
touching it to various things in the engine compartment to test for spark, 
zap, zap, pop... at one point they even killed the engine with a well 
directed spark.  Oh well, I was nice and friendly with them anyway :)

I'd run out there right now and see if that paint is the problem, but I have 
too much work to do tonight.  I'll check it out tomorrow and let you know 
how it goes.  If this turns out to be my problem, you will have made my 
day.. tomorrow!

thanks,
Brian

Brian,

&gt;So, here's my problem:  the generator I had rebuilt locally doesn't seem to
&gt;work.

coupled with:

&gt;I drove it down to the local alternator shop, not unlike a scene
&gt;deliverance down there, they poked around for a while and said that it
&gt;doesn't seem to be working... no sh_at_t.

the above seems to be part of the problem.... :)
I always make people test rebuilt generators in my presence before I install
them. It is too much of a hassle to have to pull the motor again, etc...
    That comes from a bad autozone experience... 3 out of 4 generators were
not putting out current at all. There were even old dead insects that were
stuck to the armatures with the new spray paint on the housing. bad news.
    Whenever I have had a generator rebuilt, I have also spent the $ for a
new regulator. cheap insurance.
    Anyways... checks that you can do *now*...
    First, take loose the battery negative cable. Disconnect the cable from
the generator D+ to the regulator B+ at the regulator terminal B+ (#51), and
connect the positive lead of your voltmeter to it. (Make sure that nothing
at that point is allowed to touch to ground, because you are going to start
the motor and the vibration might make this happen if you don't watch out).
Now, hook the negative cable back up to the battery, as it was just a
precaution not to short anything to ground when taking the B+ cable loose.
Okay... start the motor and keep it around 2,000 rpm. You should have
12-point-something to14 volts on the voltmeter. When you turn the engine
off, this reading should drop to zero before the engine has completely
stopped rotating.
    If the voltage is too high, the regulator isn't regulating current
enough. If the voltage is too low, it could be a problem with the
generator's charging capacity or the regulator overregulating things.
    Let me say here that many charging system malfunctions are because of
connections, bad ones. Do some continuity checks on the wires involved and
make sure that there is a clear path for current to flow. Clean the area
behind the voltage regulator, on your bus's body... this must be well
grounded and free of corrosion/crud for the regulator to work properly. Bolt
it back on nice &amp; tight. Maybe check the continuity between the regulator
case &amp; the body to be sure. Make sure that the battery cable ends are super
clean, corrosion-free, etc... take them off to do this. Even a cracked
battery cable connector won't let it charge sometimes. BTDT... Take the
cable loose at the starter &amp; wire brush it if you have to. You have to start
with a *solid* base of figuring out what is wrong, even if it was working
before. Several small problems end up making one big one...
    Now... all ends cleaned &amp; put back on.  Then to test the generator by
itself. (IMPORTANT***: This test must take only a FEW seconds as otherwise
the field windings will burn out) Disconnect the two heavy duty cables from
the regulator... tape the one that goes back to the starter or the battery.
Connect the positive lead of your voltmeter to the + cable (D+) on the
generator. Connect the negative lead to the D- connection. Run a jumper wire
from the DF terminal on the generator to ground. Make sure again that this
is all nice &amp; solid, so nothing will come loose when you start the bus up.
(The generator is now connected only to your voltmeter and ground) At
1000-1500 rpm you should have 12 V and a tad more... a heck of a lot more
(like 24V) at 3,000 rpm (only a short rev, please). The voltage goes up
because it is now *unregulated*. If you have no (or low) voltage being
produced (and doublecheck your connections here to make absolutely sure)
then the generator will definitely have to come out.
    Look down in where the brushes ride... how do the brushes look? How does
the area that they ride on (the commutator) look? Messy? Clean? Metal chips
in there from where someone turned down the commutator on a lathe &amp; didn't
get all the chips out? Turn it over slowly by hand and have a good peek at
things.

&lt;more below...&gt;

It just doesn't seem to put out any juice (funny, worked before the
&gt;rebuild). I followed the procedure in the Bently manual for polarizing the
&gt;generator, where you hook up the D+ terminal to the positive battery
&gt;terminal and ground the other two generator terminals, to run it like a
&gt;motor and build up &quot;residual magnetism.&quot;  It just barely wanted to spin,
big
&gt;sparks when I connected it to the battery.  Anyway, did that for about 30
&gt;seconds (as per an archived message from Eric&amp;Barb), helping it spin the
&gt;whole time... still no juice...


I don't like the 30 seconds... I just barely touch a power wire to the D+
terminal for a second. Barb &amp; Eric are pretty sharp about these things
though. Not a big deal if all is in good shape and the rebuild is okay.
    Now to the good stuff ;)
    It's been a hassle for you to do all this... I hate having to pull the
motor &amp; mess with pulling the generator if I don't have to.
    After you've done it a few times, you realize that there is a better
way...  one of those $139 kits from larrysoffroad_dot_com.
    A Bosch 50 amp alternator, the stand, the strap, the tin are in the
kit... and you'll need a new &quot;alternator-style&quot; fuel pump &amp; the specially
different fuel pump pushrod. No biggie... won't take you long to change it
out. The wiring is a *snap*, too.
    These things put out 50 amps for a long time... and are IMHO much more
reliable than the old generator/regulator combo. They are supposed to *last*
a lot longer too... &quot;up to 6 times...&quot; was the quote, but I think that is
only slightly exaggerated ;)
    If you decide to stick with the gen/reg setup, that's fine... I would
just use only *bosch reman* products...

good luck!
