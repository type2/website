Subject: Friday and EV in CA

Since it is Friday and we are a little OT with the bio-diesel anyway, I
thought it natural to bring up the EV (Electric Vehicle) situation in CA.

Did anyone read the latest Car &amp; Driver article about the failure of
electric cars and how CAB (CA Clean Air Board or something similar) is still
pushing for these by 2003.  I laughed and cried while reading that article.
Needless to say CA or the automakers are screwed because there is no
feasible ways to make these cars or market for these cars.  The EV1 and EV2
GM produced cost 1.0-1.5 million to make each and leaved them for about
$35,000.  Plus isn't CA having power outages anyway?  What do people think
these EV run on, and it takes 6 hours to charge for only 75-100 miles.

The whole thing is laughable.

I did see the SULEV cars to be a practical solution.  C&amp;D drew a comparison
of the hydrocarbon pollution produced by spilling one pint of gas on the
ground is the same for a SULEV car driving 100,000 miles... Crazy!!!  In a
good way :)  In comparison, a poorly tuned pre-emissions vehicle is supposed
to do the same damage in about 20 miles of driving...  I wonder if that
applies to our flat fours?  Maybe we can go 40 miles before giving off the
same hydrocarbons?  
 
Something to chew on for Friday...  Still really like this homebrew
bio-diesel idea though :)
