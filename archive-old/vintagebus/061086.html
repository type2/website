Subject: Re: [VB] Welder on an extention cord?

&gt; I've got a Lincoln wire feed Mig welder (model sp-100 or something).
&gt; I was wondering if it could be used on an extention cord? I can make
&gt; one up with big wire if needed.

Sure why not?
You dont need to make up a beast. Its 110. Whats the max amperage it has
15-20 max? just get a heavy duty extension from wally world
