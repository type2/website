&gt; While My Sweet Bus was up on the jacks, we replaced the tired old shocks.  I
&gt; put in KGY gas shocks, KG5529 in the back.  Wow. really raised her and the
&gt; rear end lifts on standing normal take off.  We have KG4521's for the front
&gt; but havent installed them yet.  The rear wheels are really cambered in too.

Define &quot;really cambered in.&quot;

Chances are you're just seeing normal rear wheel camber at no-load.  These
busses have single joint (swing axle) IRS rear suspensions and have a lot
of camber change through their travel.

Grab a few friends and fill your rear and middle seats.  Roll the bus a
bit to let the suspension settle.  Now compare the camber to your no-load
camber.  Look better?


&gt; Uh, is this a bad mistake?  Will it wear the tires and is it unsafe?

It will wear the tires, yes.  But so does any driving. :)  The
seemingly-excessive positive camber doesn't put as much edge-wear on the
tires as one would expect.

&gt; Fortunately we do have a '72 Westy that could use them, if we need to go back

The 68-79 busses use the KG5530 shock, not the KG5529. Your mileage my
vary.

&gt; to stock.  Our local flaps has stock shocks available. Opinions anyone?

Personally I think the gas-a-just is to damn stiff for a split.  They work
well on a bay.  At least that's what my rear end is telling me after 20-30
some odd thousand miles. :)

&gt; Do you have any idea of the joy and feeling it is to get a bus back on the
&gt; road after breaking an axle, or whatever?  Yeah, I bet we all do.

Sure do!  Congrats.
