Subject: bumpers away

I just sent my bumpers off to be sand blasted and need to figure out a
couple things.  I believe that I have the PPG paint number for silver
white (DCC8251) thanks to the archives.  Please correct me here if I am
wrong with that number.  My question is along the lines of is 100%
single stage paint correct for the bumpers? I have talked to a couple
people who said that a paint flattener should be used to make it 80%.
This would make the bumper not as shiny as the bus.  Keeping in mind
that my bus was painted with single stage paint. Thanks, Mark.
