&lt;&lt; the rubber between the (driver/passenger) doors and the body is amazingly

alway stuck shut until you heave on them to a ridiculous degree. This is 
really irritating. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
Hmm, maybe glycerin would soften the rubber, and/or perhaps talcum powder.  
These new upper seals seem to be too hard so hopefully the glycerin would 
help.  Last possible thing you might try is to shave just a little off of the 
top tip of this seal.  The stock seals seem to form themselfs to the curve of 
the body, and end up with a cross section looking like a bent Orca fin from 
the front/rear.  The repro seals retain the straight cross section looking 
like a shark fin from the front/rear.  This ends up fighting the curve of the 
bus, and when opened the top of the seal actually locks against the bus body, 
and has to be forced straight, and then inward curved to allow the opening of 
the door.  Maybe someday someone will make this seal with a curve, or at 
least an angle to it.  Eric&amp;Barb
