&lt;&lt; Hi:
     Is there any major change of frt. beam and rear axle/tranny between
 66 and 67 model year?  I am planning to upgrade the suspension of my 63 and 
I 
 wonder which is the best choice. 
 Thanks
 Michael

yes there are major changes.

 the front spindles/king and linkpins and brake backing plates, cylinders, 
shoes and drums are different also wheel bearings and axle nuts. also comes 
with sway bar.  Steering damper attaches both ends to beam assembly.

in the rear, the axle tubes, reduction boxes, lower outer wheel bearing, 
RBgearing, backing plates, shoes, drums and axle nut are differnt.

(disclaimer- not neccessarily so if your 63 came with the 1 ton package 
option)

In practice, you have higher gearing and bigger/better brakes.

due to larger later brakes, it is a bad idea to change only one end to the 
other type.   Change both or neither for safety reasons.

oh, if you meant between 66 and 67, there is originally differences in the 
center section of tranny gearing, but only if it was never rebuildt can you 
really say it is so, so you can't assume that.  also 12V bell housing and 
hole for starter bushing, but that is no big deal to sort out w/ new bushing 
a grinding if you are 12V and it has often already been done.
