Subject: Re: [VB] cooling and charging in a 58 - help

If you have the motorola alternator, you'll need the external regulator for 
it.  It's a little metal box with the batwing on it and it has the correct 3 
prong connector and also connects to the dash light via a blue wire.  
Another thing with that Alternator is the carb is setup with the accelorator 
pump lever upside down so it will fit, if you switch out to another 34/3 it 
will not fit w/o some engineering (bending) done.
