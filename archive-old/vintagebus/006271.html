&gt;also... how any info about how the sender works would help a lot..


Essentially all a fuel gauge is is a volt meter.  The float moves up and
down a bar or plate of wires.  As it gets closer to the top (full) there is
less resistance and the fuel (volt) gauge moves to full.

&gt;as i see it... the wire from the gauge G terminal is an earth of sorts...
&gt;the other end fits the sender terminal... which is connected to a bar
&gt;running down the tube inside the tank... the float moves up/down another
&gt;wire which is connected to the body of the sender.. the body of sender
&gt;connects to the bus... so as the float reaches different positions on the
&gt;wire the resistance changes. ... am i right? :)
&gt;
&gt;but, i've connected a bulb from the earth wire (on sender) to 1.5 volt
&gt;battery and tried to make light come on by connecting another wire from
bulb
&gt;to sender terminal.. but no shine. :(


If you have an ohm meter hook it up to the sender.  Move the float up and
down and watch to see if the resistance changes smoothly and constantly.
The sender should have two connections.  One goes to a power source and then
to the gauge, the other is the return from the gauge.
