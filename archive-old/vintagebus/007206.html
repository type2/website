Subject: Underseal removal


I have just spent 2 frustrating weeks attempting to remove the tar like
underseal  that coats the underside of my 67 bus.
Chemical stripping has been futile as the coating is so thick.
Heat/scraping has proved to be excruciatingly slow,messy and unhealthy due
to fumes and skin contamination.
I have found the fastest solution is to use a blunt air powered chissel to
remove the bulk of the material and to then soften any remainder with some
kind of tar emulsifying solution and scrubb off with steel wool.
Go easy with the chisel and keep the tip at an acute angle to prevent metal
deformation.This method is still slow,very noisey and still messy.
The ultimate  solution appears to be sandblasting.I just got a local company
to test blast a small section of chassis rail with great results.To do a
thorough job engine needs to be removed and all undergear removed also.
Of course all the original primer will also be removed but most companies
offer a galvanised zinc coating application for not too much extra.
Hopefully my bus will be blasted next week .I'll post my final verdict then.


Phil
