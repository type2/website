&gt; No; my figure was based on the fact that I had it UPS delivered, so after
&gt; delivery, tax, etc it was just a little over $200.  Mine had the back and
&gt; sides, but no front.  I still have the instructions that came with mine;
I've
&gt; always meant to contact them and see if they make a front panel/door,
which I'll bet
&gt; they do.

&gt; &gt; Costco must be higher priced in your area, in the Phoenix and Las Vegas
&gt; &gt; Costco's they are 149.95 and Big K-Mart also has the same covers for
175.00
&gt; &gt; sans back and sides.
