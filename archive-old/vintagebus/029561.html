My birth certificate says &quot;special color&quot; or &quot;special option&quot; as well.
It denotes from the factory the Deluxe colors. In my case it's Chestnut
Brown and Sealing Wax Red. Biege Gray is the top color on Deluxes for
59. My RH headlight bucket says SPOR or probably SPOP which sounds like
it means &quot;Special Option&quot; in my case. I can't figure out the last letter
that well but &quot;P&quot; makes sense. &quot;Special Option&quot; is what the factory
called Deluxes, although I'm not sure how long this lasted.

&gt; I just received my birth certificate for my 1959 deluxe and it has &quot;special
&gt; painted&quot; for color with no paint code. Has anyone received a birth
&gt; certificate for a special painted bus that had a paint code shown? Anyone
&gt; know if they have that info in the archives?
&gt; 
&gt; My bus was definitely sealing wax red on the bottom and has the word &quot;grau&quot;
&gt; written in the RH headlight bucket like my other 1959. The only difference I
&gt; can see is the upper color seems to have a lot more gray in the color.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately in the past the upper portion of the seat partition was
&gt; removed along with the m-code tag. I would like to restore the bus
&gt; eventually with the original colors, but am not sure where to go from here.
