    I've got a web site I'm working on. You can visit it at 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Factory/8565/ I've got quite a few 
events listed on it. If you have an event and want it listed, send it to me 
or to missouri_micros_at_yahoo_dot_com and I'll post it. I know geocites is pretty 
slow. My internet provider was bought out by someone else. I'm waiting for 
the conversion to be complete before moving it. They won't give me a 
definite answer when.
    This is my first attempt at a web page. Some stuff isn't done yet. Some 
stuff worked one day, now it doesn't work and I didn't change anything. So 
bare with me. I thought the events page might be useful to someone before 
summer is over.
