Subject: re roof dents
Date: Fri, 3 Jul 1998 00:20:37 -0500

I have a SERIOUS roof dent problem - Ive been told that finding another
roof and getting it welded on is an option - Ive also considered some sort
of sunroof - does anyone know of an after market sunroof package of some
sort - The cover and mechanism stuff is, i realize, not much of a problem -
but how bout the track thingy that the sunroof rides in - is that
obtainable? - i really hate to change my roof - or do the sunroof - but i
am takin about serious roof dents
