Hi all

I have a bit of a problem with my 59 panel. When I put my foot on the brake pedal the brake lights come on but one is very dim (bad earth I thought). When the park lights are on the one that goes dim goes compleatly out when the brake pedal is depressed. I'm running 6v and have cleaned all of the conections. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks 
Steve
