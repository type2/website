Jobs jobs jobs,  right now I am a commercial photographer.  I drive my 66
deluxe bus to work everyday, and to location shoots as well.  I once had to
drive an art director from Samsung heavy equipment HQ to the demo center,
about 25 miles each way, and she clutched her cell phone the whole time we
were in the bus.  I used to think deluxe buses were luxurious, I still do,
but she apparently didn't.  On the other hand, she loved that I could stand
on the full length roof rack and take &quot;high up&quot; pictures.
Another time that was &quot;bad&quot; was when I had to make a U-turn while we were
going to photograph an installation at the Biltmore estate.  I &quot;had&quot; to drive
on the lawn of the largest private home in America.  Ouch, I thought security
was going to have my bus in a sling.
Take the bus to work, everyday.
