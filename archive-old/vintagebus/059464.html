Subject: RE: [VB] Vac Dizzy Q

I do not know about the cam which would have some affect on timing 
but the 205T is a good match with the 30pict1. As I recall the 
30pict1  is the same as the 30pict2 except the 2 is designed to have 
a deceleration lag for emotions purposes. You need to take vac from 
the port on the carb. Any single port manifold with a vac port was 
for an autostick Beetle circa 1968 to 1970. That manifold is very 
handy if you want ot have a single port motor that can supply vac to 
a brake booster.
