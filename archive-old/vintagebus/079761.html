 &gt; When the engine is cold, it starts quickly and idles fine. It sounds
 &gt; great, no tapping sounds, no other unusual stuff. As it begins to warm up,
 &gt; a 'tapping' sound begins, primarily from the left side of the engine. Once
 &gt; the engine is hot, the tapping sound is quite loud over the regular sound
 &gt; of the engine. That is my problem. The engine has great compression
 &gt; (130-135 all around, no leakdown), and the timing is fine. Engine idles
 &gt; when hot just fine. It has lots of power and doesn't seem to have any
 &gt; faults beyond that loud tapping/clicking sound coming from the lower left
 &gt; of the engine block. Lower end of engine now has about 75,000 miles on it
 &gt; since 1993.

something else to try would be to use one of those stethascopes you
can pick up at a FLAPS to try and pin point where the sound is coming
from. I have heard a long screwdriver works as well, but you would be
amazed how isolated you can get the sound with the scopes.
