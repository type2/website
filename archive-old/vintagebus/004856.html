Its not RHD, the tow truck guy snapped off the drivers side mirror arm when
he was unloading it into my driveway! grrr
The og paint was too far worn thru to the metal to be buffed, due to the
nice AZ sun everyone loves.


&gt;Honestly...I think it looks better in primer with the UK number plate.
&gt;Actually, is it an RHD?  I saw the outside mirror was opposite where I'd
&gt;expect it to be.  Frankly, my 2 cents on the subject, if you've got the
&gt;original paint and it's a little faded or there original logos on it and
&gt;there's no immediate rust danger, then leave it.  They look awesome that
way.
