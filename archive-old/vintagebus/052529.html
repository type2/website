Subject: Re: [VB] Strange, rear, windows, on, a, crewcab

That's a stock small center window and two DPO added small windows.

Any good parts still left of the crew?   Were the gates still there?

I wish it would stop raining so I could go junkyard hopping today....

&gt; I looked at a junked crewcab today and instead of one large window, it had a
&gt; smaller center window and a small window on each side of it. It sure looked
&gt; factory to me. Is this something ODD or have I just never noticed this setup
&gt; before.
