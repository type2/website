I thought I'd relay an interesting story one of my friends told me last
week.  You AZ guys can probably figure out who this is.  ;)   We were
talking about a Squareback he used to own back in the 80s when everybody
wanted a pimped-out Squareback, some of you may remember those days.  Ah,
the memories...  He had taken it upon himself to build the *ultimate*
Squareback.  Starting with a 1964 &quot;N&quot; model (rare car, to you Bus guys, that
would be like starting with a ribbed bumper 15-window), he proceeded to
convert it to RHD, install an elaborate selection of original EMPI Type 3
goodies, and so on and so on.  So we're talking for a while and he says:
&quot;Yeah, that was the one with the Barndoor [Bus] ragtop.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;  I replied, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;This guy had a Barndoor Deluxe in his yard, I paid him $100 to cut the
ragtop section out of it.  Then I took it down to the local body shop and
paid them to shorten and narrow it, adjust the frame and sliders, and cut it
into the roof of the Squareback.&quot;
At this point I was pretty much laughing at the insanity of it all and
managed to spill out:
&quot;Oh my god, did it work?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, it worked perfectly,&quot; he answered, &quot;That car is still around in
Flagstaff, AZ, the guy asks me every once in a while if I have found him
some RHD pedals for it yet.  As soon as Barndoors became popular, I went to
go get that Bus but it was long gone.&quot;
