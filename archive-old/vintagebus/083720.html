Subject: Fuel tank cleanout (was never assume)

Well, the bus stopped idling again, so it appeared that more was needed
than a simple carb cleaning.  I decided to drain and rinse the tank and
lines, replace the filter, and clean the carb again.

Started with the tank.  Made sure that there were no ignition sources
nearby, as this job has to spill gas.  Got the bucket, broke the big nut
loose under the bus, and spun the nut out.  Got gas soaked all the way up
to my shoulder while pulling the screen out of the tank.  About two
gallons of gas flowed freely into the bucket.

Slid the bucket out from under the bus.  Gad, the stuff inside looked bad.
Pale yellow in color and couldn't see the bottom of the bucket through 8
inches of the liquid.  Looked and smelled very stale!

Poured the stuff into the waste gas can and checked what had settled out.
There were a considerable number of particles, but large enough that a
fuel filter would have caught them.

Poured two gallons of new gas through the tank, filtered, and repeated
until no particles came out.

Took carb out and disassembled.  Air volume screw had noticable varnish
deposit, which was probably what caused the poor idle.  This carb had been
cleaned only a week before, so there was definitely something very wrong
with the gas!

Flushed fuel line out with fresh gas, reassembled everything, poured a
couple of gallons of fresh gas into the tank and fired it up.  It idles
perfectly now!

Now, what to do with four gallons of stale and dirty gas...

George
