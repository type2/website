I'm running into a real problem here. I'm hot &amp; heavy into this new engine,
rebuilt the rdg boxes, ran wires for the new guages,
now, the washing machine has started leaking. The basement is the garage.
The truck is on blocks right beside the washer.( sent the wheels to be
painted ) I gotta get an exhaust system built &amp; get some oil lines made
afore I install the engine.
So, I'm crawiln' around on a wet floor, the brand new engine is sitting on
the creeper.
I don't think I can reprogram my  brain to work on a washing machine.
Life is tough!!
