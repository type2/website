Grove, CA

Hi, 

Our re-painted medium blue 1987 Westfalia Vanagon Camper (lisc # 2Juy726)
was 
stolen last night (February 21-22, 2003) after 10 PM from the parking lot of
the Homewood Suites Hilton on Harbor Blvd in Garden Grove, CA. It has an
orange  Huntington Beach, CA  beach pass on the left lower front window. Our
Sony Mavica digital camera in a Route 66 tapestry bag was in the car. The
camera has some pictures of my mother's February 10th funeral on it.

Thanks so much for any help,

Linda Schultz
