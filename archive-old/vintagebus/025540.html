hi group,

I am using one of these swampy air conditioners in my work truck, and
personally, i am pleased with the results.

it wont cool of the entire inside of the bus, rather it provides a cool
breeze for you.  just point the vents at you, and it works great.  i put
it between the front seats of my bus, so it blew air at my feet and
kinda swirled up around the rest of me, and it makes it a lot more
tolerable.  you do have to leave your windows open, or else it will just
get humid.  humid = pleh!

so its not going to match the ac in your &quot;other&quot; car, but does help.

hope this info helps

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I stumbled across this site looking for something else.
&gt; http://www.swampy_dot_net/bvw.html  Anyone ever see one in person?  Looks like a
&gt; simpler alternative to AC if you live in a low humidity area.  I have no
&gt; affiliation to this co.
