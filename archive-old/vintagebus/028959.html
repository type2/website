Just got home, and checked out this thread...

Meredith is a fellow enthusiast and friend. He's been working on VWs for
a long time, as I have. I've only been here for the last year and a
half, and I've heard my share of horror stories about the place that I
work at, so I can't really take issue with his response...

Here's the deal. The owner of the place (who shall remain nameless) is a
very napoleanic, hardnose business man who doesn't always make the right
business decisions, in my opinion. He is a very hard person to take for
a few minutes, much less all day long, 5 1/2 days a week. Turnover has
been very high at the shop for the last few years, and I'm sure the
quality of the work suffered as a result. Prices on parts and service
were often arbitrarily high, too.

A few things have changed in the last year and a half. I jumped at the
job because I love VWs, and even took something of a pay cut so that I
could work on them and meet other enthusiasts. I often bit my tongue and
toughed it out when I disagreed with the way things were going. I'm in
it for the love, not the money, and I love my customers as well.

We hired a technician from Mexico last year. Hilberto comes from a
family that owns a VW dealership in Mexico and has worked on VWs all of
his life. He couldn't even speak English when he started, and at Hippy
Days this year he expressed to me in his broken English (he's gotten
much better since) his love for VWs. He can pull, rebuild and reinstall
an engine faster than anyone I've ever seen, and he cares about his
work.

Steve, the manager, has only been there for the last 2 years. He worked
for NOPI before that. He's been building engines for 20+ years and is a
very ethical man.

Steve (the other Steve), the parts guy is also a fellow enthusiast. He
has been there for about 3 1/2 years and knows practically every VW part
by 9 digit number by heart. He's more a water-cooled guy, but I guess
that's ok...

Here's the best part. The OWNER decided that he was tired of dealing
with cars, and made a career change a few months ago. At first, he tried
doing his new thing and still micro manage the place, but nowadays he
might stop by for 10 minutes once a week, just to say hi. I think there
may be some personal issues involved, but that's not for me to say. He
has left things pretty much in our hands.

In some ways, business has suffered since he left. He is a terrific
salesman, and we haven't sold many cars since (I never cared for the
used car business, at least with cars that aren't truly &quot;vintage&quot;). On
the other hand, we have much more freedom to try to compete with other
vendors, local or catalog or internet. More enthusiasts have been coming
by, sometimes just for advice. It has become a much more pleasant place
to work.

Not to say we haven't made mistakes. We recently built an engine for a
customer who took his rail buggy to a big rally halfway across the
country. He ran his new engine on his buggy on the trailer once he got
there. It threw a rod, and spoiled his expensive vacation. I don't know
that he followed proper break-in on the new engine, but still, it
shouldn't have blown up.  We found out that the new engine was built
with the old oil cooler installed, which came from his old blown up
engine. That was obviously our fault, and we should have insisted on a
new oil cooler for his new engine. We won't make that mistake again. We
are rebuilding the engine at our own expense. Lessons don't come cheap.

I believe it is better to have loyal customers who come back than to try
to make as much money as possible on each and every exchange, and my
fellow co-workers have the same attitude. Things have changed around
here...

If it was totally up to me, I'd get rid of these damned Hondas and
Jettas and concentrate my efforts on Aircooleds, with maybe the
exception of Vanagons and Cabriolets, but in this transitional period,
we need all the business we can get. The reason I wrote the original
post is to try to get more of the enthusiasts back, and ask them to give
us more of their parts and service business.

Meredith, give us another chance! You won't be disappointed!

david
