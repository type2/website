&gt; I am looking into purchasing some &quot;rubber diamondplate&quot; roll.  It's 4 ft
&gt; wide and comes in rolls up to 50 feet or so.  I wan to put some in the bed
&gt; of my doublecab, and I need to make a piece about 5' x 5'.  Can I just use
&gt; rubber cement and glue the two edges together, reinforced with fiberglass
on
&gt; the backside?  Is there some other trick?  Or am I stuck with the edges of
&gt; my bed exposed to the cargo in the bed?
&gt;

Paul,
  I bought a cut-to-fit bed liner at a truck supply store. It was wide
enough to do the whole bed with enough length left over to make a floor mat
for the rear seat foot well. Cost about $80
