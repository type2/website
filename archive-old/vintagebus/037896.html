Actually Ive been here for the last 6-7 years year round.  I own a
coffeehouse downtown called Common Grounds. My 72 is the famous fire flamed
purple westy, I also have a white and very light blue 64 sundial, and a
maroon vert ghia.   It looks like the gathering is probably happening sept
16th.  As for mosquitos.. Im at assateague almost everyday with my dogs
swimming bayside on the federal side.  Mosquitos are part of the outdoors,
some days are worse than others.  You must have been there on a very calm no
breeze night. Just gotta bring the repellant.  September is a pretty good
month for assateague.  Nice cool breeze, no flies...

Emmet,

The get together is a great idea. But Assateaque in August??!! Are you
new to the area??!!

Assateague in August has the most voracious mosquitos I have ever seen.
Once, I saw them and they appeared like smoke, thats how thick they are.
Another time, we pulled in and attempted to put up a tent. We knew they
were swarming, so we jumped out of the car and tried to put up the tent
as fast as we could. After about ten seconds and a few hundred thousand
bites, we ran back to the car, caught our breath and tried to recover.
We then jumped out again and tried some more. Tens of thousands of bites
and we were back in the car. Mind you, my tent is very easy to set up.
Yet it took many attempts to get it up. We then unzipped it quickly,
threw ourselves inside and zipped up as quickly as possible. The next
few hours were spent killing mosquitos. Finally, we lay down only to
hear the incessant whine of one last mosquito. After being bitten
hundreds of more times by this intruder we got up, pulled up stakes and
bailed out!!!

I have never seen anywhere as bad as Assateague. Count me out unless it
is the first weeks of spring.

Did I mention the ticks that carry Lyme Disease??

Don't say I didn't warn you.

Les
