Subject: Don Garies obituary

I don't know if any of you knew Don Garies or not but he passed away last 
Wed. He had a heb, a split window bug, a 23 window bus and a ton of other 
VWs. He was quite a character but if you ever talked to him you'd know he 
was really passionate about VWs and not a bad guy at all.
