So why don't we resurrect the W-X VW swap for the fall 'rama?  That was a
kick-a** swap!

&gt;      I don't see why people don't just buy a bus and do all there swapping 
&gt;at OCTO. Don't swap at the classic, if it wasn't for the OCTO meet, I 
&gt;wouldn't go down there.  I didn't live here at the time, but from what I
have 
&gt;heard, the reason there is no bus get-together before Bugorama was that BH 
&gt;was upset that there was money being spent under the freeway, and thought 
&gt;that he was gonna loose mula the next day. Now that I think about it, now 
&gt;that he is the new partner for the classic, I wonder how he feels that OCTO 
&gt;gets the big swap the day before the classic??
