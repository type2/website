Message-ID: &lt;81nj8f$sjh4_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

today at 2:30 pm we had a fire at type2parts_dot_com  aka old volks home of
az
the fire was contained to an area where records were stored and my
bookcase
of original shop manuals, it also got to the loft storage above that and
did some damage to part of my porsche 356 parts stash, did find the 16
inch
wheels i thought were lost. No bus parts were lost and there was no
damage to the showroom or to the shop or any of there contents.

the bad part is i got a hell of a mess to clean up and my phones and
electric
are down for the moment, all phone calls will be forwarded to voice mail
which will checked often (starting sat.). temp electric, phones and 
computers should be up by monday or tuesday, sorry if this will cause
any inconvienance to anyone, all current orders will be shipped by
wednesday and
we will process all phone/pmail orders monday, nobody was injured in
the fire,
did burn the top of my head though!!! and as i repeat nothing in the
shop or 
showroom were damaged, praise to the local fire department and to the
fire
extinguisher's in the shop.

ps, had a great turkey day, deep fried a turkey, 13 lbs in 45 minutes,
watch for this at the next JEROME and maybe BBBIV

thanks to all on the list,and  we are still open for business

to bad i don't drink, could really use 1 now, but a cup of jo and some
pecan pie should do the trick
