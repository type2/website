&gt;Once you have the idea, the terminology, the question list (hopefully short),
&gt;the book, and the parts/grease/tools needed list,  head for that reliable
&gt;parts
&gt;store.  Pick a time when they are not too busy and are more likely to have
&gt;time
&gt;to discuss things.  If you can talk the lingo and are specific, most guys will
&gt;talk to you.  They want to sell the parts and are usually willing to do some
&gt;explaining.  Also good to set up a relationship if a part breaks and you need
&gt;something fast.  People identify better with a person they have met - get his
&gt;name.

I would be very careful about taking repair advice from parts guys.  I have
overheard some REALLY bad advice which waiting to be helped in parts
stores, especially chain stores like Checker, Pep Boys, etc.  I think it
would be much better to do your research (the Muir boook is the primer,
followed by the Bentley book for the real solid tech info), and then post
your specific questions to this list (after first checking the archives and
library at type2_dot_com).  The tech advice I've seen on this list is 10x
better than anything I've gotten from parts guys.


&gt;
&gt;Once you are into it, it helps to have someone else read the book, also
&gt;good to
&gt;have someone around to hand those tools that are just out of reach and for
&gt;safety.   Try the list if you get stumped on something, the reasearch archives
&gt;have saved me a time or too.

I find reading the library and archives to be fascinating and informative,
but maybe I'm weird (my wife has her doubts...).
