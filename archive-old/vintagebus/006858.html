All these antenna's are designed for high end auto audio so they should
work, I'm going to get a mid range priced one to try on the bus stereo's I
sell.

&quot;I just recieved a catalog showing hidden antennas, there is a mat antenna
that you could glue to your top under the headliner, &quot;

Has anyone used or heard a system using such an antenna?  I'm curious of the
reception, though I assume it's as good as a home stereo which uses much the
same type of antenna.
