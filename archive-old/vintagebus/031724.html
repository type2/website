Just wait till you get your other Westy there, then VW Howard and I will
come visit with JP and add a few more.

rachel, and all: this morning i moved the '56 single cab into the back
yard, so they're all in the yard now. plus, when you (rachel, that is) get
home, there will also be a '56 sliding ragtop bug in the garage, making 6
vehicles. should i arrange it so we get the white 67 bug and the ghia there
too? sounds like a party to me!

  all but one of the buses is in the backyard.    there is a '67 sliding
door sunroof deluxe, '62 double door panel, '61 flip seat westy, '56 single
cab and a '54 panel.
