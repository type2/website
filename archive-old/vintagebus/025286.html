To all,
If you go to The Omaha Volkswagen Club you can read a short report on
the Return to the Fatherland tour's Stop in Lincoln Nebraska last night.
I also have several pages of photos of some of the most valuable and
beautiful VW's I've seen. Check out the 1943 KDF. The West Coast Metric
support bus was kickin' tunes and Lorenzo from WCM seemed to be real
mello. He showed me the new WCM toy bus. A GOOD time was had by all.
The address is 204.26.80.78:8084
