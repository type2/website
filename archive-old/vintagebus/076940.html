Subject: Re: [VB] Proper side mirrors

I think you had many options at the time.  

I think the little round ones look cute, but the elephant ears are more 
functional.   

I think the repro little round ones are bettr quality than the repro elephant 
ears.

The oval/rectangle mirrors that go on the harp/ D shaped mirror arms are more 
functional, better looking than the elephant ears, and of course rarer.

Hello Everyone,

I have a 67 standard bus. I need to replace the side view mirrors. Which
ones are correct? Some list the &quot;elephant ear&quot; as correct, while others list
the smaller round ones as correct.
Thanks for the advice!
