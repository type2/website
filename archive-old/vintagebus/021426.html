Subject: Disc Brake Conversion Questions
Date: Mon, 6 Jul 1998 22:17:42 -0700 

All this talk of disc brake conversions for our splitties is getting me
curious.

Can anyone respond further on the following disc brake options:

The main points to talk about are - 
1. ease of installation
2. cost of kits and parts
3. effect on ride hieght
4. effect on wheel base width (while retaining wide five)
5. any other tid bits.


OPTIONS ( that I can think of so far)

A - Exchange entire beam with 68-69 Type II and use 73-79 front
spindle/disc and wide 5 adapter (if compatible)

B - Use 68+ Front Trailing arms machined to fit current -67 beam.  Use
73-79 front spindle/disc and wide 5 adapter (if compatible)

C - Use conversion kit from Wolfgang and wide 5 adapter

D - Use Old Speed Conversion Kit and wide 5 adapter (if compatible)


If I had the time and the money, I would love to install and do a
comparison of all of these conversion options.

BUT, I do not, so I call upon the wisdom of the list to share thier
experineces and knowledge.

I can then compile an FAQ or something to that effect. 

Please let me know of any other options as well.
