I'm gonna buy new clutch parts to put in my bus. I guess I need the 
clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Is that right?

I've got a '75 1600cc bug engine in my bus and a big-nut 
tranny/rear-end. What year/model clutch parts to I tell the idiot at 
the computer to pull up for me?

Thanks for any help. Trying to avoid making an extra trip.

sounds likely you have the 210 mm (200?  not 180) clutch, the kind with the 
ring where it meets the TO bearings

at idle, does the noise the bus makes change when you step on the clutch?  If 
so you need that TO bearing.  If not, I would not bother with it myself as 
they are what $35 .

does it drip oil from between the engine and trans?  was the clutch slipping? 
  If so get a new O ring and main seal,   and while you are at it replace the 
seals for the oil cooler, 4 if doghouse, 2 if not.
