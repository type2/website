Greetings all! Walt here again. I had to change my email for this group
being as how AOL6 insists on putting html in all emails. Anyways, on to my
question
    My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too
bad(needs the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot),
but after I finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are shot.
I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't
think I need to explain what I am getting at. I swap pans on type 1's all
the time, but it doesn't appear to be as easy on a bus. Any ideas????

P.S.-What exactly is a Samba? I originally thought it referred to a 21
window or the like but lately I have seen it when referring to trucks as
well. Is this like an option package or something? lol. Seriously, I dont
know and was just curious. Vote me in for stupid question of the week, I
dont care! Thansk again!
