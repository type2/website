&lt;&lt; As to those commenting on getting over eleven gallons in by tilting the 
bus to the side, I have to say that this is true, but irrelevant.  I say that 
because as soon as you get the bus level again (or even worse, park on the 
side of a road with a bit of a crown to it), all that excess fuel will pour 
out the overflow tube.  Among other things,
 this is not the safest nor most environmentally-friendly thing to do.  I'm 
wanting the working volume of the tank, not the maximum volume. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
For one thing we are not talking about even that much of a tilt to be able to 
get over 11 gallons in there.  There is no overflow tube so that is not a 
problem.  Lastly we only fillup when we know that immeadiately we are going 
to drive a minimum of 20 miles to drop the level in the tank as to not be a 
problem.  So far since we started these practices the problem of fuel 
spillage has not been a factor.  Eric&amp;Barb
