Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

I got the idea of wrapping the tube from someone on the list, may have been you that mentioned it!!!   It was really easy, the length was a tad under 4', and I had bought a roll of insulation that was 4' long, so I just cut ~1 inch off an end, wiggled it into place, cut along the long way once I figured how wide it needed to be, and zip tied it up.   15 minutes?    The shiny bubble wrap stuff is so easy to use! 

 If it worked for you in the front I'll try it there.  cool.  I mean, warm.  :)
 
 I believe that the pedal seals are pretty much the same as the spark plug wire seals, where they keep the air from blowing out of the cylinder tin, so if you have old spark plug wires, just pull those off them.  BTDT
 
 I've been meaning to replace my accerator rod with a new one, and have the parts and seals, but haven't done it yet.

 &gt; Hi Clara,
 &gt; That looks like the exact same stuff I used on the length of heater tube on
 &gt; my bus also, used zip ties too! .... Great minds....
 &gt; 
 &gt; I wrapped it on the very front heater tube section that 
 &gt;is covered by the splash pan also and have had no problem   
 &gt;with it dealing with the heat of the
 &gt; bare metal tube. Like you, I noticed a difference in
 &gt; heat after wrapping it with that stuff. 
.....snip......... I put
 &gt; a new seal on my accelerator rod through the floor, 
 &gt; but WCM is still on backorder for the brake and 
 &gt; clutch pedal seals.
