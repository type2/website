&gt;Amen.  Everyone wants &quot;freeway flier&quot; trannies, which is fine for
&gt;Kansas, toto...

but I disagree. Rosie has a 3.88/.82 freeway flier coupled to a 2110 with
dual Weber 40IDFs.
The biggest freeway hills in my area are the Grapevine to LA from
Bakersfield (65 and accelerating in 4th), the Altamont Pass to the Bay Area
(80 and accelerating in 4th) and the infamous Twain Harte grade above Sonora
(55-60 mph steady in 4th). A freeway flier is the ticket, but you need the
horsepower to pull it. I would guess that a 1776 is a bit small,
particularly with a .77 4th gear. My guess is at least a 1904/1915 cc motor
to do the job properly.  I think the .77 4th is a bit extreme, better to try
the 3.44 r/p if you really want to go over 100, keeping the jump from 3rd to
4th reasonable.
