Hi Pete,
You probably would be best off finding a 1964 or later bus of the same 
non-walk through or walk through front seat/s as your bus and take 
measurements off of that.  This is what we did to our 1963 SC to install lap 
belts, and are now plotting on cutting out the threaded mounting holes in the 
upper pillar areas out of post-1967 wrecked buses out this way.  Then we will 
cut and weld these pieces into all our early buses to provide the upper 
shoulder anchor.  We probably will do the same to the our 63 SC and 60 panel 
camper to all the other belt mounting points.  Interestingly our 1962 SO-34 
Flip-seat Westie came with lap belts and threaded mounting points from the VW 
factory.   Eric&amp;Barb
