To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

B.T.W., i didnt part this truck out in any way...this is &quot;as found&quot;.
Has some wood side gates homemade type thing.
Nope, no cut wheel wells, no cuts to the apron.......and no cuts to the dash, 
no cuts to the taillights, no extra blinkers or nothing.
1000$ is the listee discount price, price is firm, and does not include 
delivery.
It will be at pomona 08-26 with some work done to it and it will NO LONGER BE 
1000$.
I dont want to hear bitching from people saying &quot;Well he only paid this for 
that, and that for this&quot;, and &quot;he had it advertised for 1000$ last month, why 
is it more now?&quot;
Like I said, price is firm, and this is the price this week.
This singlecab is probably worth more $$$, but I dont care.....I want to see 
it go to a good home. And i dont want to sit on it for months trying to get 
every last dollar for the thing.
I refuse the right to refuse service to anyone. =)
Uh...no shirt, no shoes, no service.
If you're cool and buy me lunch or something, I might even deliver it.
Thanks.
Greg

&lt;&lt;buy this thing...get it running, slap some gates on there and make a quick 
sale!!!!!!!Hello-
I was interested in selling a 62 singlecab.
Its not a driver.
Has a running 12V alternater singleport motor of unknown displacement.
I would guess its a 1600.
Transmission I was told was good but I have never driven on it.
Bus has been parked for 6 years so I will guess the brakes need some 
attention.
Like I said, Its not a driver.
Bus is complete MINUS the THREE SIDE GATES, BOTH FRONT AND REAR BUMPERS AND 
OVERRIDERS, FRONT BUMPER BRACKETS, ONE 15&quot; BUS RIM (FOR THE SPARE), AND THREE 
DECKLID PROPS.
Has the rear bumper brackets.
Truck is together, intact, motor installed, doors attached, glass in, all 
parts included are bolted in place with original hardware, ect.
ITS NOT A NIGHTMARE BUS THAT COMES IN BOXES!!!!!!
The truck is VERY straight.
Very nice body, bed is great, treasure area has no rust, both cargo doors are 
mint, decklid is mint, rear apron is mint, cab doors are mint, dash is mint, 
front floors are mint (Can see reflections in the original paint!), battery 
trays are mint....VERY nice corners. All glass is uncracked.....and original, 
less wingshields which have been replaced at one time.
It hasnt really been abused.
This would be a SUPER easy restoration.
Its original color is Turqouise and it has been repainted once in the 
original color. Paint really looks pretty damn good. I will need to hose off 
the 1/4&quot; of garage dust to get a better idea but....It might not even need to 
be repainted.
Only negative things about the body are......left rocker at the very bottom 
is a little bit crunchy...you cant really tell unless you're on the ground 
and pokig you're finger at it.
Left inner rocker is solid and doesnt need to be messed with.....but the 
outter left rocker IMO needs to be replaced. Do it once, do it right, right? 
Second negative thing is it got bumped in front, hit right on around the 
headlight bucket and kinda moved it a touch.
Im fairly confident I can fix it in a few hours but I havent spent any time 
on it.....It can be repaired without cutting or doing anything bad to the 
front skin. Otherwise the front skin is great and doesnt need any work.
Has a good front floor mat which is original, has the radio blockoff, has 
original front kick panels and headliner panels.......with the little 
brackets to hold them up, has side door panels which are black speaker carpet 
type thing.....original grey ones could be located underneath? Front seats 
been recovered.....something is weird about the front seat....might not be 
correct, or it could be 62 only? or singlecab only?.
Im not sure. Didnt see naything super cool like a jack or tool kit or 
anything.
Bus does not have a spare....tires arent the greatest.
Ill have photos after I clean it Sunday.
Bus is located in Thousand Oaks, CA which is about 50 miles N of L.A.
Bus has past dated registration.....atleast a few years.......I have the 
California Title.
Email or inquire with more interest.
ATTENTION RESELLLERS!!!!!!!
