Subject: Re. Coat hooks and assist straps

incynr8

My bus (65 deluxe) has 6 coat hooks and one assist
strap.  The strap is on the pillar right behind the
rear cargo door.  There are 2 hooks over the assist
strap and the other 4 are on the drivers side.  2 next
to the rear seat and 2 next to the middle seat. (On
the B pillar)

I have been told by Charlie Hamill that the 2 on the B
pillar should have only been one hook but i am 100%
certain that there were 2 there when i tore the old
headliner out.

hope that helped.

Matthew
