Subject: Found old manual(help)

Hi list, I recently acquired a VW Service binder with Technical
Bulletins for 1958. There are many Transporter updates, such as Speed
Governers, Rear shift rod protection, Pop-out installs, the new
&quot;re-inforced&quot; bumpers, radio install, ambulance fan install and more.
The only problem is, this book got wet, and alot of the pages are stuck
together, and have mold. Could I &quot;re-wet&quot; the pages to separate? and
then hang to dry?
 If I can salvage these bulletins, I will be sure to scan, and make a
page for all to see! I also picked up a '58 Ghia manual, but that one is
near mint.....

TIA,
Michael
