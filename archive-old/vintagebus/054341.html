Subject: Re: [VB] generator bushings.

Take the shims (not bushings) out!  Adding them loosens the belt!

The tightness of the bolt doesn't affect the tightness of the belt.  It
tightens until metal-to-metal contact.

&gt; for a while my bus has not been charging the battery.
&gt; i replaced the voltage regulator, checked the brushes,
&gt; and i was about to take off the pulleys whe i realized
&gt; that the belt spins freely of the pulley. it's too
&gt; loose. so i took out some bushings and tried to
&gt; tighten it up but i couldn't get it tight enough. in
&gt; the process, i broke a breaker bar and got a nice
&gt; raspberry on my head trying to tighten it. my question
&gt; is, do i need to ADD bushings between the pulleys or
&gt; take more out? there's only a couple in there now.
&gt; thanks a lot for you time.
