  Hi Volks,
  I put up a 'small' preview of BBB5 on my website.  It's only as far as I've gotten.
I'll post more info as I receive it so you'll, (where the h*ll does that come from, I'm 
from NYC!), can print it out.  Just start planning KNOW!!!
  Yea, I know I still have my pics of Jerome up, did I mention it was my 1st trip in
a split?  Jerome and BBB are great, what more can you say?
  Lou in Havasu,
&quot;You know your in Arizona when.....
        you see Lou making &quot;BBB5 street signs!&quot;
