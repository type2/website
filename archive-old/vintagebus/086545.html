&gt;So I go inside the ['58 SC] and only find the lite wires,NO Ground wires
&gt;in there at all.,I find that to be real confusing, so I go back out to
&gt;the headlites and pull on the ground wires and they come out of the
&gt;factory housing ,still looped  together. They had never been hooked up at
&gt;all. I think I just got punked by  some factory worker from 1958  LOL  .

I wonder how the headlights were working at all in the first place.  Did
it have the short brown wire from the parking light bulb to the headlamp
ground terminal?  That might explain it; on my '64 the parking light
bulbs have that short brown wire, but the parking light socket is also
designed to ground the bulb to the metal headlamp shell.  That would
provide enough of a ground for the headlights to work, at least until
you hit a real good bump or something.

&gt;One neat thing I did find inside the headlite housing was somebody had
&gt;wrote Blau with their fingers in the factory paint.

Maybe they figured that some dealer mechanic would have to diagnose the
headlights before delivery and would get to admire their finger-paint
skillz.  :)
