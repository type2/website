I am considering buying a full length industrial roof rack tomorrow. How =
do I tell if it is for a early or late model. The zvw tag is no longer le=
gible. I have seen racks that have the straight side bars on the front, b=
ut this rack has them on the side with the bent side bars facing forward.=
 I hope this makes sense. It does not have the horseshoe style clamps it =
has clamps that are about 2&quot; wide and 6&quot; long that go from the gutter to =
the threaded rod mounted on the rack. It is similar to the rack on this g=
reen bus(almost a burn victim). http://vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/3375.=
