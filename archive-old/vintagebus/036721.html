&gt; The Merc part numbers for the headlight units are as follows 
&gt; 322820 1661(left)
&gt; and 322820 1761(right). These are the 'euro spec' headlights 
&gt; not the sealed beam variety and they are set up for right 
&gt; hand drive/left hand side of the road countries. The lenses 
&gt; are asymmetrical and are therefore not interchangeable side to side. 

The last four digits of each part number are supposed to identify it as
having an asymetrical lense suitable for a rhd/left hand side of the road
country. If you are looking for them in the US or elsewhere the first six
digits are apparently the same.
