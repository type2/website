It's never good to have metal just floating around in the engine :),
but you already knew that. Its hard to say if you need to replace it,
it might have already been replaced sometime in it's former life. But
if you desire, it (or a new one) can be replaced by pulling the
distributor drive. I believe the wilson rebuild book has a picture of
this IIRC. If it were my engine and everything was still running. I
might try to clean up the engine of sludge and just run it.
