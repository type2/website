My 67 21 window had LO MICRO
My 911 crew cab had WATZIT4 when I bought it (ick)
I still haven't decided on a suitable replacement, but the commercial plate
is fine for now.  Maybe FLAT 6, but not sure yet.

Also had JINXED on an old Ghia my dad and I did years ago (mom's nickname is
Jinx)
Then we had JINXED2 on the 55 micro that went to Japan.
