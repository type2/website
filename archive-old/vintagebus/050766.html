If you run a tempory wire, make sure it has a switch on it or can be
disconnected easily so you don't burn up your points !

Run a temporary hot wire from the battery to the coil and see if the bus
cranks (do not leave it on permanently it will overheat the coil if left on
24/7).  If the bus cranks then yes, you do have a bad wire, or contact in
the fuse box.  If worse comes to worse, run a new wire from front to back
(it's not original, but it works).

I'm having some electrical issues. I think I got it figured out. There =
is no power getting to the coil, but there is power at the fuse (2nd one =
from right). I think it could be a broken wire. Anyone have an idea or =
is this too vauge?
