Subject: re:[VB] Free Tucson Show Help Please

Jerry,
As a friend, I hope that you chill out and NOT go. Yes, you are deserving of
all of the attention that you get but HEY- it's time to mellow out. Car shows
are not live and death. Life and death are life and death. Get a grip, Sir. =)

Just call me whacky and silly. If I were in your shoes, I'd be listening to my
wife and doctor about right now.
Car shows come and go. I intend to see you at them for years to come.

I will not be going but will be doing landscaping and painting the interior of
my house. If you are feeling better I can use a lot of help shoveling gravel
and scrubbing the walls and patching plaster. Let me know if you are up to
it...

No? Oh OK, you better relax and take care of yourself.
Chill out and listen to Melissa for a change. Cool it or we will all come over
and give you a pink belly or something.
