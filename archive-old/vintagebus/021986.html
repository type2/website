Aren't you maybe a little touchy as people are dogging lowered buses?  You
guys should just accept that some people don't agree with you about lowering.

  Well I really don't give a flying ____ what anybody thinks about lowered
buses, I wrote what I wrote because, as you say, transplanting a roof is a big
job. But if it is a big job, wouldn't it just be easier to fix your 21window
than to put the roof on another bus? Or is it easier to give up? Should let
someone else buy the bus, lots of low budget bus people who would love to get
a cheap sunroof bus to slowly restore as money permits, just don't cut them up
if it's not there time, and you think it is!
