Hear hear!!!
Here's a toast to 'each his own and to hell with the rest'!.


&gt;&gt;You know, we don't need concours rules to judge our wheels.  We don't!
We drive these things partly because we do not want to be tied down to
the world of rules and propriety that wants to tell us that we are
oddballs and our buses are beat up pieces of crap.  They are not crap
and we are simply wonderful people.  Why give into the beauty show.  The
concours people would envy us if they had any idea of what they are
missing.   Let's not tell them!   Gary Gibson
