Subject: New Carb shelf life

Hi List  I was just thinking about the new carb I
bought some months ago while I was trying to find the
then current problem with Ol'No Names little
replacement engine.That engine now sit out of the bus
but I had run the new carb on it.I removed the carb
and drained the float bowl and pumped the throttle on
the carb by hand and watched the fuel shoot out the
bottom of the carb until no more came out.I then put
it back in the plastic bag and the original box and
put it on the shelf inside the house.My question,Is
that enough to clear the insides of the carb so they
wont &quot;Gum up&quot; and block fuel as the carb sits on the
shelf for a couple of months or more? Thanks.........
