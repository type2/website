Subject: Re: [VB] Was Timing and overheating question...

If I recall your first post, you're using a 009? From my experience with these
dizzies you only get around 17 degrees advance. With timing set _at_7.5 BTDC, your
total advance is only 24.5 degrees, a little retarded for best operation.

Set your timing at max. advance to 30 degrees BTDC and let idle fall where may.
When the 009 was developed, timing varied from 7.5 to 10 degrees BTDC.

&gt; Thanks all for the advice/reasurrance on my oil temp. I checked all seals and
&gt; the compartment looks pretty tight. I am using Castrol 30 wt. I adjusted the
&gt; timing to 7.5 BDTC and the thing would barely idle (sort of a loping thing).
&gt; Hmmm could this be a carb out of adjustment instead, or should I just crank
&gt; up the idle speed screw and forget it?
