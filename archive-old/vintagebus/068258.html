Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Castrol and BP

Disclaimer: I run Castrol GTX straight 30 weight in my Bus, along with
a semi-sekrit additive blend (cockatoo poop, among other things). And
like the High Performance chapter in later editions of the Idiot manual
says, &quot;Asking people what kind of oil they use is like asking what beer
they drink.&quot;

I prefer Guiness myself, but my Bus always has Kendal!

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
