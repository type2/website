As I think I just posted recently, an easy way to see what's happening when
you remove the upper 2 nuts AND the engine is to angle up the rear of the
bus (drive it onto ramps of about 4&quot;- if undrivable, jack up each wheel)
while you lower the engine and trans combination back to level, using a
concrete block and appropriate 2x6 pieces as shims to hold the trans.
Being level is critical, because remember that a rolling jack must be
parallel to the level of the transhaft to make reinstall easy!  This worked
fine on my 71, but when they added the _at_#&amp;#$%$ unremovable body crossbar
and the bolted up front trans carrier, it was particularly tough in a 72
before the upper access hatch was included.  Get the longest box wrench you
can find, ideally one with a SIX sided opening.  You can tap on this with a
small sledge and those upper nuts will easily
come off.
   On reinstall, it's now easy to eyeball the transhaft/clutch alignment
over the fan housing - if you use a 3/4&quot; piece of plywood board under the
jack, (did you read my post on when I used 2 scissor jacks on the board,
which ROLLED on broomstick pieces?), you align it with taps of the sledge
on the board- &quot;easy&quot; to do totally alone this way.
