&lt;&lt; All I have to do is go to my friendly hardware store tomorrow and find 
some extra long studs. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
Good luck!  We looked for several months for those.  You can take these studs 
off of destroyed type 4 engines.  We finally figured out how to go about 
making these studs and had to buy a bunch of material at one time to do so!  
If you or anyone else is interested in a pair of these extra long studs to 
install a type 4 cooler in doghouse shroud for $5.00 including shipping in 
USA, please Pmail us.
