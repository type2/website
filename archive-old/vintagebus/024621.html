Subject: Last year of Semaphore????

Hi all,

According to Thom's website (www.vintagebus_dot_com), the last year of the
semaphore was in 1956.  Is it possible that this is for models to a
certain location.  I have a '59 with semaphore slots.  Were these posts
welded in later or were they using left overs?  Is it possible that some
'59's going somewhere still had them?

Thanks,
A Hill
