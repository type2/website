Subject: DIY Blasting place?

Does anyone in Southern CA know of a self service blasting shop?  I
remember reading a resto series about an alfa in European Car magazine.
The author found a place in S.D. I think that would let him bring in his
own media and blast away.  They never named the place.  I think he did
the whole car for $250.  Any thoughts??

Steve
