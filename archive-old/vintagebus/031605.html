&lt;snip&gt;I ended up buying a new one from Radio Shack about $7, it fit
perfectly, no need to drill any holes. Although your method sounds cheaper, i
wonder if the sound might be a bit sharper if the speaker isn't shaking in its
mount?

I did the same thing when I was trying to get my radio working. I bought a $20 speaker from radio Shack that fit the plate.  I went out and hooked it up to the radio.  It sounded awful.  Just for grins I hooked up the original, and it sounded better!  Pretty sad considering the original paper was completely torn and only about a 1/3 of it was even there.  I walked back in Radio Slack and returned the speaker.  The ratty original one has been in my bus ever since.  Never have gotten around to replacing it but I don't listen to the radio much anymore anyway.  I do need to find an original one for my resto though.  Anyone know of one?

Thanks,
Richard
