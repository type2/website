Subject: Re: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

&gt; after a weeks work, drove it from monterey,
&gt; california to chicago without any plates.  he later
&gt; told me that he was stopped once, in colorado i
&gt; think, for not having plates.  he had all the sales
&gt; documentation and didn't get a ticket.

In New Mexico, the plates stay with the owner, and
you've got 30 days to register the vehicle in your
name, so it's legal here to drive for a MONTH w/out
plates, as long as you are carrying the paperwork,
(bill of sale, title, insurance, etc.)

It's getting worse, but it's still more laid back than
California.
