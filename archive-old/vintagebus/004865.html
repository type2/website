Have you ever heard of the David Suzuki Foundation????  I heard David talk
in a lecture once and he had fun with this concept in explaining why we
should be more careful with our environment.

I'm not endorsing the David Suzuki Foundation...  please don't flame.

&gt; Hey, if you do the math, everyone on this list probably has a few atoms of

Well, there are about as many atoms in a breath of air as there are
breaths of air in the atmosphere.

The implication is this:  Every breath you take contains one atom from
every breath everyone who has ever lived has taken.  Yes, you get a few
atoms from Einstein, and Ghandi, and Newton (not to mention an equal
amount from Adolph and Atilla and Joseph).
