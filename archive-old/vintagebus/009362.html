I'd say you have 2 options...


Plan &quot;A&quot;.

It's not technically difficult to remove a tire from a rim/wheel using hand
tools, but as Jim notes it's a real bear of a job.

You'll need:

A relatively hard, flat surface to work on with the tire/wheel lying on it's
side.

Goggles for eye protection, especially if you use jury-rigged
implements/tools.

Heavy leather gloves for protection from sharp burrs on tire bead and/or
rim.

Expendable/disposable attire.

A bead breaker - to force the tire's steel-reinforced bead out of the
seating/sealing groove at both edges of the rim.  This can be the most
difficult part of the whole job.  You can buy an inexpensive manual breaker,
or use [carefully!] some combination of lever and BIG hammer/mallet/sledge.
Stomping with BIG [preferably booted] feet is seldom effective, but can be
emotionally satisfying.

A pair [minimum] of tire irons or reasonable facsimiles.  Crowbars work
fairly well, BIG screwdrivers are only marginally effective.

1.    Deflate the tire.

2.    Force the bead on one side of the tire out of the seating groove on
the rim, working it free all the way around so it drops free into the
INTERIOR of the rim.

3.    Turn wheel/tire assembly over and repeat #2 on other side.

4.    If there's an inner tube fitted [common procedure, even with
&quot;tubeless&quot; tires] remove it now.

5.    Using tire irons, BIG hammer, etc., work one tire bead over the edge
of the rim all the way around.

6.    Turn wheel/tire over and repeat #5.

Only 3 more to go and you're done.  Four more if you're doing the spare
wheel/tire as well.


Plan &quot;B&quot;.

Make a deal with the tire shop.  Point out that you want them to remove the
old tires so the rims can be refinished, etc., and that you'll be buying the
new set of tires from them at the appropriate juncture.  They'll probably
just waive any fee for demounting the old tires, knowing you'll return for
the rest of the job.  This is how most professional shops would handle it.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Go ahead.  Try it.  After you do one, you'll be happy to give the tire
&gt;&gt;  guy $5 to do the work!

&gt; Anyone ever remove their own tires?
