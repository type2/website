Subject: Re: [VB] Re: headlight bulb swap-ability

&gt; The halogen types H6024 and H6026 have a slightly wider beam and better
&gt; light output in low beam; the H6024 is a particular winner on low beam
&gt; at the same current as stock with 35% more light output.  On high, 30%
&gt; more current buys you 30% more light.  Wagner also has a &quot;long life&quot;
&gt; version of the H6024 that is rated at 900/1500 hours.

I've been using some H4's with adapters to fit into the bus buckets, for
many years. Don't recall where I got any of it, but I have two spare H4
bulbs that I bought back then as well.
