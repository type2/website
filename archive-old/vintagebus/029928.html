I think one thing that needs to be pointed out about the proceedure
outlined in this post for cleaning out a heat riser tube is that it is
extremely dangerous. If you look at a can of caustic soda, also known as
lye, you will see the skull and cross-bones symbol. It is there because
that stuff is really that dangeous. It turns your flesh into soap using
the moisture in your skin. It does that to your eyes too. The damage can
be done before you feel it. It's especially foolish to use it with
boiling water. Don't do it.

I hope that got the point across. It was a little OT, but I saw another
post just in the last few days that also mentioned using this stuff. Use
your lye for cleaning your drains only. Follow the directions and heed
the warnings on the label. Lets all be safe, please.

&gt; I recall reading a few years ago, in the British VW Type 2 Owners' Club
&gt; bi-monthly magazine (Transporter Talk), that the heat riser tube (i.e.
&gt; inlet-manifold, exhaust preheat pipe) can be unblocked chemically, without
&gt; having to resort to cutting or drilling holes.
&gt; 
&gt; The inlet manifold is first removed from the engine, an placed up-side-down
&gt; in a suitable tray or bowl. The chemical solution is then poured into the
&gt; exhaust preheat pipe and allowed to soak into and react with, the compacted
&gt; carbon; topping-up as necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; For the moment, I cannot remember exactly which chemical is used, but I
&gt; suspect it is a commonly available, domestic drain cleaner, such as
&gt; sulphuric acid or caustic soda (i.e. sodium hydroxide). Hopefully, I shall
&gt; be able to check the details, before my next e-mailing session on Friday!
&gt; 
&gt; I used caustic soda dissolved in boiling water, to clean all the internal
&gt; steel components, of my air-cooled VW engine, which works extemely well.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards.

&gt; P.S.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of chemicals, do any of you folks use EDTA (i.e. ethylene diamine
&gt; tetra acetic acid or its di-sodium salt), in your lead-acid starter
&gt; batteries, to prolong their service lives, by inhibiting the sulphation
&gt; process? We use it in ours, most of which typically last 6 to 8 years. The
&gt; original one on my father's Ford Sierra XR4x4 lasted nearly 13 years.
