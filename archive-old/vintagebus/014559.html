Question on the clutch.  The pins that hold the through-out bearing is scoured
and continues in an arch up on the thrust mechanism itself.  Although I didn't
measure the circumference of the scour - it prolly matches up with the spring
teeth of the newer-style pressure plate.  Me guesses I need to use the old
style, with the three pressure points.  Am I right.  This fits a newer 1600?

not sure what your question is w/ the throw up bearing clips is.   If the 
clips are marginal replace them.    if it looks like they are weakened, they 
may break, tossing the throw Out bearing  into the teeth of  the frantically 
spinning FW, which will promptly throws it up, but like a horse there is no 
way to get it out, so it churns around unhappily until you shut off the 
motor, and you meanwhile hear this lovely noise and find your clutch dont do 
nothing.    Then you can avoid an emergency roadside repair and/or cell phone 
call to AAA, depending on your choice.  the ones with the circle twist in 
them are reputedly better /stronger that the ones with the simple bend, but I 
have used successfully (and been let down) by both kinds.

but you do want a clutch with the round thringy on it  .  That presses 
against the round TO bearing.   I like the 9 spring clutches myself.

the clutches fit on the FW, it main issues is

1.   small diameter vs large -  mostly at issue for 6V buses, or buses w/ 
stepped cranks which must have a stepped FW, which usually means 6V teeth &amp; 
small clutch.  (size of indent in FW for clutch, also believe holes for bolt 
are in different places anyway.)  Most of the 6V have the smaller clutches, 
although I have seen one 12V FW that take sthe smaller clutch, that is very 
ncommon, virtually all12V FWs take the larger clutch.  

2.  the ring thingy for the earlier TO bearing or the teeth thingy for the 
late style (post splitty sometime)  so if you get a motor out of a later bug 
and pop it in your split and the clutch doesn't match the t.o. bearing it 
will make a yucky screetchy noise and scar the TO bearing. (bad)  

3.  there is also the nine spring (for small dia. 6 spring) clutch vs the 
many arms type.   Both work,  many folks prefer the 9 spring type - sturdier 
or something.

hope this helps
