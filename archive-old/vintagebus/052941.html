 I am a little angry at WCM. I am redoing my overhead
 flap system and I ordered the 211-810 &quot;body seal&quot;, in
 there diagram it shows the piece as a
 vertical/horizontal/vertical, what I got was a
 straight piece of foam core door rubber. My question
 is that, was the original seal a 1 piece unit, or was
 it 3 pieces. I couldnt find a diagram of it on the
 online parts book. Anyone know how much foam core
 rubber is a foot? And I also ordered the 211-757 seal
 fresh air flap w/14 rivets and it came sans rivets.

 I dont remember if it is one piece molded as a U or three pieces, I think 
one, but you get the same effect by cutting the WCM piece into three 
appropriate sizes and gluing it to your bus.
