Hey Rory:
1) did you check the lamp?
2) did you check the connector at the lamp socket?
3) did you check to see if you have flash signal (power) to the socket?
4) does the flasher 'click' even though the lamp doesn't go?  If this is the case, you might want to check and see if you have a short at the socket.
