Thanks for all the replies. I only want to use it for light stuff. I already
have pretty much all the necessary tools and they're all electric. Now
perhaps I might add an impact wrench. That would be enough. Main thing is
painting? Will there be enough pressure to get good results? I don't know. I
might want to just wait a while and look around.

Thanks again,

Andre

&gt; I don't agree with the slam of the oil less compressor. However as with
any
&gt; other subject, you must know your limitations. I'm a contractor and have
&gt; three oil less compressors that I use all of the time, some times even
&gt; continuously for weeks. They live well enough for me but this is just for
&gt; shooting nails. I would not ask them to do any thing else. At home, just
&gt; like Thom, I have a 5 H.P. 80 gallon unit that will almost keep up with
sand
&gt; blasting and my IR 1/2&quot; drill. No problem with impact wrenches, air
hammers,
&gt; crimpers, shears, or sanders.
&gt;
&gt; Save your pennies Andre, you'll be glad you did.
