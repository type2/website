 My grandfather made his own bearing greaser which was nothing more
&gt;than a bolt and 2 washers with a zerk in one of the washers.  He could
&gt;really clamp down tight on the bearing and force the grease into the
&gt;bearing.
&gt;
&gt;
I made one of these to repack the wheelbearings on my autocross cars 
with synthetic grease. It cost about $2. It was a large washer the size 
of the bearing on the o/d and a small i/d to pass a 4&quot; bolt through. on 
the back side there was another washer the size of the inner lip on the 
bearing( o/d) and the I/d was the same as the top washer. I drilled 3 
small holes in the top wqsher and screwed some zerk fittings in. 
Sandwich your bearing between the 2 washers, tighten the nut and bolt, 
and grease away! The factory fill is very uninspiring compared to the 
synthetic grease with anti-wear additives (synthoil, Redline, amsoil)
