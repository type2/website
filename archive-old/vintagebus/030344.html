While much of the list was basking in the glow of the warm Havasu sun
many of us were toiling away in the grey of winter. The photos that NQ
and Rob Laffoon were posting from the event really cranked up my case of
cabin fever. You folks must be suffering too cause I served out over
16000 images since Saturday AM. That doesn't count anything that had
been retrieved from what Stephen Gutknech had posted on Ronnie's page. I
am impressed enough that I will keep the page up for a while at least.
Hell if anyone wants to post events like this let me know. I could turn
this into another obsession(Frodo my 65 Westy came first) I have posted
a few more pics including a panorama shot of the raffle and the
campsite. Please excuse the quality. My rookie photo team did not have
time for enough training on making panos before leaving. I think they
did a great job and want to thank them for sharing. Links for the wide
shots are from the front page.
I heard tell of a BBB V lapel pin that was being sold at the campground.
Being a pin collector if someone could direct me to where I could get a
couple for collecting and swapping purposes I would be most grateful.
For those of you that haven't seen the pictures yet check them out.
Ronnie's site is http://www.oldvolks_dot_com/events/bbb/2001Photo/
the link to my page is http://204.26.80.78:8084/bbbv/bridge.html Mine is
created with thumbnails so it loads better on a slower connection.
