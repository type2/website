&lt;&lt; A week (Friday night until the next Sunday - 9 days of driving) doesn't 
seem too short to expect to go 2500 miles, does it?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Well figure at least one day for repairs or playing tourist.  That leaves 
eight days to divide 2500 miles which works out to about 300 miles a day.  At 
about a 50 MPH average you will need to drive six hours each day.  So that is 
what you need to figure if you can hack that kind of time behind the wheel.  
would be better if you could get a second driver to help spread the time 
with!  Eric&amp;Barb
