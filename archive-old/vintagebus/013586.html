I suppose it depends on how masochistic you are, but I wouldn't try
it....

You don't need to pull the engine per se, although I find that easier
than trying to undo the fan or fan housing with the engine in.  Once
you've got the generator out on its own, you undo the really long
bolts that run through it lengthwise (front-to-back, when it's
installed).  Undo any other miscellaneous bits that seem to be holding
things up (like, say, the fan).  You then slide the core out.

For the non-machine-shop-equipped, probably the easiest way to get the
old bearings off would be a gear puller that's had the arms tied down
so they can't spread off of the bearing.  Note where the bearing was
on the axle for future reference.

Getting the new ones on is the trick, and I haven't found a guaranteed
solution yet that doesn't involve a press.  The best results so far
have involved putting the bearing in a warm oven (around two hundred
degrees or so) for a while, until they're thoroughly at the same
temperature.  Meanwhile, be working out a way to firmly brace the core
so you can push along its axis and it won't go anywhere.  A large,
bolted-down vice is one option.  Next, work out a hollow drift that
fits down over the axle of the core, and will press evenly on the
outside of the bearing race.

Now that the prep's out of the way, you take the bearing from the
oven, place it on the axle so that it's going on straight, and slide
it down to where the old was.  Some folks might want to use leather
gloves or some other hand-insulator during this step....

I would recommend against heavy hammering (at least use a rubber
mallet).  I suspect that the combination of freezing and using a metal
hammer is what caused the varnish insulation in mine to fail.
