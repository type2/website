Subject: windshield washer bottle
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id XAA85899

does anyone know if a 68-78 washer bottle for type 1 will fit in a '65 bus. 
Actually, I am sure it will fit in, my bus has plenty of room.

Will it fit on the parcel shelf, where the normal one goes

there is one on ebay, and I wasn't sure if it would fit my bus.

thanks

kevin
