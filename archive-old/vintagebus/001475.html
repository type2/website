Just read this message and thought those of you wanting to do a T4
conversion would like to read this:

Yes its true MSHP has gone under and we at WEST COAST CORE have only
employeed the worker i.e. &quot;polo and chuck and doug&quot; and also purchased most
of their eguipment we are doing all the same work but by no means we do not
have anything to do with Mark Stephens. If you had problems with Mark we
would like to hear from you and we are looking forward to working for each
and everyone of our fellow vw owners  we have been in bussiness for 9 years
now and have a complete machine shop and complete used part store body and
machnical parts alike, we also stock new parts and of course we do all type
I,II,II and IV heads stock and high perf. and full line of reconditioned
parts. thank you and have a fonderful day and enjoy your vw's often
