Anyone interested? I've got a 1966 21 window ragtop for sale in Northern
California. No rust, never been in an accident, rebuilt 1600 cc engine
with dual carbs, new alternator, new white ragtop, new tires.
Last trip was a 3-month venture throught the Pacific coast towns of
Mexico. She never gave me any problems. Asking $7,250 or ???. Email
randolphr_at_webtv_dot_net or call Rick at (530) 345-5950.
Rick
