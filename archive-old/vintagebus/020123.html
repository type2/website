I underestimated (badly) how much time these classes I'm taking actually use
up per day.  First, there's three hours daily for commuting back and forth
using bus -&gt; MARTA bus -&gt; Train 1 -&gt; Train 2 -&gt; GSU and reverse.  There's
class non-stop from 8:45am - 3:30pm.  We cover an impressive but brutal week's
worth of material per day in each class.  I'm taking just two here and three in
regular summer session.  When I'm done, there is plenty of homework to do upon
arrival at home.

But I still find time to work on my bus :-)  I've gone from slacker to
non-slacker in two days flat.  I have to start as soon as I get back and can
only go for a while.

Tranny.  Thanks for all the advice, I'm going to try adjusting third out and
probably live with the whine.  If third keeps popping I'll pull the tranny once
I'm done with this first set o' courses.  I already talked to the rebuilder who
said he'd be happy to take a look at it if third kept being an issue.  I plan
to try putting the new freeze plugs in that I got from Bus Boys this weekend.
They look nice, but the old ones will probably be un-fun to take out.  I 
anticipate having to pull the engine (this is time #6 or #7 in as many weeks)
and probably slide the tranny back to get at the plugs.  I'm going to take 
Sunday off of work so I can hopefully get that done.  Now I just need to find
a local source of GL-4 tranny oil!

I re-fixed the oil leak on the DP filler just this evening, I found a pinhole
in it that was causing the mess in the engine compartment and sealed it up.
I also fixed an oil leak beneath the bus that was due to thread-sealant 
dissolving/melting/something on the oil filter mount.  This created a neat 
smoke-screen/asphalt-lubricator device the other day!  I used teflon tape this
time and so far no leaks.  I cleaned off the oil except for on the heat
exchanger, as I figure it'll be a nice surprise for the commuters in the
morning.  &quot;Hey, look that bus is on fire or something!&quot;  ;-)  Also discovered
that my heat risers work great, even after only a half minute or so of engine
operation.  Hopefully my palm won't blister.

Also I had the valves adjusted wrong, they were _way_ off somehow.  That was
the clatter which I was beginning to fear was Something Bad.  The engine now
seems unnaturally quiet in comparison, I like it :-)  Still need to rebuild 
another SVDA distributor, I will start on that tommorrow I hope.

I ran out to Radio Shack when I heard the news about the bus radio on sale.
They had to order me one but it'll be in tommorrow.  For those who were asking,
the stock number is #12-2004.  I hope that it'll fit OK in my '67 dash :-)

Can't wait for the VW show in Marietta on Saturday!
