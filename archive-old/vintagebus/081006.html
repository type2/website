Subject: what tool for manifold nuts?

i can't imagine the factory running down those hard to get at 10mm nuts on
the single port intake manifolds. is there a cool tool to hunker them down
with? i've thrown everything i got at them and they're starting to strip.
prolly the cause of my vacuum leak. - steve
