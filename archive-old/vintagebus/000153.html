&gt; Now both boxes are leaking from what looks like behind the spring plates.  
Is 
&gt; this common for a bus that has sat for a long time? 

I had a problem with one of my plugs leaking when I couldn't find a new one, 
so I just permatexed the spring plate to the reduction box and it's working 
fine.  I'll be at OCTO with it.
