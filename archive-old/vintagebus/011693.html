Subject: Upside-down shocks
Date: Mon, 31 Aug 1998 11:21:48 PDT

Hello fellow bus-heads.
Well, it seems my brilliant solution wasn't quite so brilliant after 
all.  You see, on my badly IRS-converted bus, the outer casing on the 
shock did not clear the IRS arm which holds the wheel to the torsion 
tube.  Based on another bus I saw, I decided to put the shocks upside 
down.  This way, the outer casing stays solidly against the arm, rather 
than bashing into it and chipping away.
Unfortunately, I've been informed by another listee that my shocks will 
fill up  with water and possibly freeze in winter (dangerous).  I'm not 
so worried (just a little bit) about freezing here in Vancouver, but 
this wet coast weather will surely provide an ample supply of water to 
collect inside the shock casing.  *%$#_at_&amp;!  So, can I drill a couple of 
little holes near the top (bottom in this case) for drainage or is that 
a really bad idea?  
Thanks in advance
Diana
