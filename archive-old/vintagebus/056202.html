&gt; Why is it so hard for anyone to accept that this is a
&gt; westy? Why is there so many that think its a hack?
&gt; Because it has one jaulosie window?? Didnt dormobiles
&gt; come with one popout, one stationary, and one
&gt; jalousie? You guys never seen two tones westys before?
&gt; I don't own the bus, don't live near the bus, never
&gt; seen anymore of the bus then what is on the ad, but it
&gt; gripes me that everyone thinks its a fake. I thought
&gt; we were more educated than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ya- that bus seems to have an original interior
&gt; &gt; there, and carefully doesn't
&gt; &gt; show headliner-
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I have heard that once in a rare while westys were
&gt; &gt; made from standards,
&gt; &gt; Though it's much more likely that someone hacked in
&gt; &gt; a flip top, and installed
&gt; &gt; the kit.  You could buy kits for installing yourself
&gt; &gt; back in the day, make
&gt; &gt; your standard a 'westy'.
&gt; &gt;     The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense.
&gt; &gt; Halfway swap over is what it
&gt; &gt; implies.  Seen them w/ 5 (with solid in the closet)
&gt; &gt; or with the regular 4
&gt; &gt; solids 2/ popouts, but any mix and match jalousie
&gt; &gt; and popout was home grown.
&gt; &gt;
