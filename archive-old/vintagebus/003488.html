    i am having some problems disconnecting the motor from the transmission.
it has barly been out, if at all in the last 41 years. the bottom two bolts
are easy and they can come out, the problem is the two bolts that you have
to take out of the top. they were really tough to start but when they
started, they got real easy. it was then that i realized that they were
spinning in place. i then went under it and looked for the back of the two
bolts, but i coulnt find them. so, i was wondering if anyone else has had
this problem and if so, what they did.

i had no problem taking the motor out of my 69 (except it took a week
because it was my first one) but the rear setup is very different in the ten
years between my two buses, which i learned really quickly when looking for
the rear brace under the 1200cc.

well, any help would be much appriciated.
