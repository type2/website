Subject: Re: [VB] Carb Question

Hi Thomas,
It depends greatly on what size, type engine you are running and the type, 
year, size air cleaner and stock or aftermarket muffler.  If you are running 
a 1300-1641cc engine the air correction jet should be somewhere about 
125-150.  The fact the air correction jet affects the idle means your pilot 
and/or main jetting and/or perhaps the carb itself is way bad.  Air 
correction jetting should only affect high RPMs of the engine.  The bigger 
the air corrction jet the more air is allowed into the fuel mixture going to 
the main jet. Eric&amp;Barb
