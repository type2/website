&gt;when I did my 65, I got 1/2 gal each B-White and V-Green.    I really
should 
&gt;have gotten twice as much green, and painted the entire  outside bus
green, 
&gt;then painted the white over the top of it.   

When I did my '67 I bought a gallon each of Pearl White and Velvet
Green.
Since I was doing the outside and the inside of a deluxe, I ran out of
white and ended up getting another quart to finish painting removable
parts (parcel tray, window frames, etc.).

I still have some green left, though I painted the engine compartment
and wheel wells. 

&gt;Supposedly gives a slightly diff 
&gt;shade.  That is what VW did, anyway.

I've wondered about that, but I don't think my '67 was that way.  I do
know
that masking to paint the green bottom after everything was white
made a lot more sense.  The masking lines around doors looked
like the green bottom followed the white top.
   
&gt;I didn't get Glasurit, I got PPG, and 
&gt;spent a lot on paint and primer and mixers and fixers and cleaners etc
etc. 

Amen.  I went with DuPont Centauri.  But only after self-etching
primer,
sanding primer, sealer and lots of sanding.

&gt;But the paint still looks good 3 years later.  I had no idea what I
was 
&gt;doing.  Prep work is the key.  

Amen again.  My paint job is at least six years old now.  Prep. Prep.
Prep.
I enrolled in community college auto body courses to get familar with
tools, technique and to make my mistakes before painting the bus.

&gt;WHo is doing the painting and prep work?    
&gt;You can call a local paint shop and ask if they have the brand you
want, and 
&gt;if they don't who does.

Don't  be surprised if you have problems here.  I went to several
paint
shops and they all turned me away.  It seemed to me they were more
interested in insurance money for the twisted Ch*vies and F*rds in
their shops than a VW bus in primer and ready to paint.
