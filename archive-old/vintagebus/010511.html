Subject: Wanna go to BNNTA?

For anyone wanting to go to BNNTA this year from afar, I'm extending the
offer to anyone on the list that would like to go.  I'll have room for at
least 3 or 4 people in my bus.  If you wanna fly into Omaha or Lincoln, I
can pick you up.

Just thought I would offer as the spur of the moment trips seems to be the
most fun.  Jamie Auch can testify to this.  I like meeting new listees and
being able to road trip with them is the best!  Read all about BNNTA at
www.busesbythearch_dot_com

It's 300 miles from Beatrice, NE to there on 2 laners.  Email me if think
you wanna go along.
