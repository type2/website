Subject: Re: [VB] got hoops?

What's the current market value on these? I have a set I'd bought
for the '55 and never installed and forgot about 'em

I think it's time to have a VW garage sale...

&gt; Hoops.  I know there are a few sets out there, I just need help locating
&gt; them.  I have a canvas that should be done in 
&gt; about a week, but a canvas without hoops is hardly a canvas at all.  Please,
&gt; list, oh please help me locate some hoops.
