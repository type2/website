Chuck,
I remember seeing the show but I don't remember what happened.
Did they get the plane out?

Remarkably enough it's warmed up some here and I've been able
to enter my bus and get her running. I took her around the block 
a couple of times and let the engine get to normal operating range
for awhile. Rain came along and washed most of the ice off the top
and it's given me at least a little hope that spring is not too far off.
John

&gt; &quot;&quot;My bus is still iced in, I plan on getting  out my
&gt; oxy-acetylene
&gt; setup this morning to thaw her out. It's kind of like
&gt; that crew
&gt; on the Discovery Channel who found that WW II bomber
&gt; under
&gt; the ice and brought her back to the surface.

&gt; Careful with that torch, remember what happened to
&gt; that WWII Bomber that was dug out of the ice?
