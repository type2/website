Subject: Front end shop in San Diego?

Anybody know of a decent front end shop hereabouts?

I know it is considered a major listee sin to pay for this sort of work,
but the facts are: 1) I don't have the time to do it right now, b) am not
sure I would ever have the inclination to rebuild a front end myself, and
c) I want to be able to drive my &quot;new&quot; (and presently dangerous) 67 DC.

So if anybody has had a positive experience with a front end shop within
towing distance of metro San Diego, I would appreciate hearing about it.
