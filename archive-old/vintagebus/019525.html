I have a set of front and rear wolfsburg &quot;repro&quot; bumpers.  They're not
actually repro - they're late-model brazilian bumpers.  They have a
strange cutout on the bottom for the exhaust, which you really don't
notice unless you're down there adjusting the valves.  They're a little
thinner than the OG ones, but I didn't mind.

&gt; Does anyone have recent experience with Wolfsburg West reproduction rear
&gt; bumpers? I'm trying to assemble a straight setup from a variety of NOS and
&gt; original parts. The blade itself has a flat spot that defied the best
&gt; efforts of Victory bumper a few years ago.
