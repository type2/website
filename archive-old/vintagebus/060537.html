&gt; Rebuilding an engine for the first time, a mid '63 40hp. A few of 
&gt; questions:I'm interested in adding a full flow oil filter. Where exactly do 
&gt; I tap the oilgalley to return the filtered oil? I can do this myself, 
&gt; right? Any tips?&lt;&lt;

Hi Joel,
Best way is to install a oil filter/pump.  No hoses to fail!  The only 
drawback is you have to cut to reangle and weld the neck of the filter cover 
to keep the filter from interfering with the heat riser tube coming from the 
lieft side of the stock muffler.

Will the later 1600 &quot;doghouse&quot; oil cooler adapter fit the 40hp case? (I 
don'thave an &gt; extra adapter to try it myself.)The Wilson book seems to push 
&gt; the idea of putting a 69mm throw crankshaft(stroker in this case) in this 
&gt; engine. Before I dismiss the idea, anyone had anypositive experience with 
&gt; this?Why am I going to all this trouble on a 40hp engine? I think it is 
&gt; pretty close to what my early '64 ratwagen was born with. I have a second 
&gt; bus missing an engine. I have heard the 40hp is a little tank, slow but 
&gt; hard to kill. &lt;&lt;

The forty HP engine is a good one for durability due to being such a low HP, 
but the more you hot rod it the less durabilty you will have.  The other 
problem is that you could install big bore HP P&amp;Cs with a 69mm crank, but the 
40 HP heads and intake manifold will not breath well enough to make it 
worthwhile.  If you want a 40 HP engine that is a little bit more HP either 
go with a set of big bore P&amp;Cs or the 69mm crank (Preferably 
counterwieghted!), not both.  The latter will require 40 HP rods machined to 
fit 1300-1600 connecting rods.

 Realreason: I only had $18 and I wanted an engine, this one cost $15. What 
&gt; else could I do?

You can get a good core engine for less than $50 and get what you really need 
for daily bus driving and in the end will cost just about the same as doing 
up a rebuilt 40 HP engine!
