I saw these today, good projects, minor rust, minor damage to both, some
Bondo, missing a lot of parts.  The '57 Kombi is an original Safari Bus but
no safaris.  He really needs to make a deal so money talks.  '59 Std. is in
better shape than the '57 but still needs work.  No engines but he had some
36ers and others laying around.  He wants to sell both together and will
adjust price to do so.  If I had the time and the parts...

I have no vested interest.
