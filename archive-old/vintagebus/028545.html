When they were in business, Das Bulli Haus was selling repop washer bottle
tops.  They were close, but didn't have the cast in writing on them the top of
the button.  I bought one cuz they were cheep.  I've never really tried to use
it.  I seem to remember I tried to fit it to a bottle but gave up after a
little struggle. I'm not sure who really made them, but I think they might have
come from England.

&gt; latex replacement would not be impossible to make.
