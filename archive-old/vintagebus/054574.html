ok, then there are 5! we all forgot the wide walk-thru early type seat. and
what about a swivel seat? does that make 6?  plus who knows how many weird
one-off variations there may be out there? (contemplating
rarity........................)

&gt; There was a fourth!  The 1961-65 Westie Flip-seat SO-34 &amp; 35 campers that
had 
&gt; a front bench seat that back of this seat flipped over to provide rear
facing 
&gt; seating while camping.  Eric&amp;Barb

In August, I obtained a '60 DD Panel.  I noticed for the fist time 
tonight the odd front bench.  It has a hump in the back rest.
