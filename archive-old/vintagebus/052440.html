Subject: Re: [VB] 28 PCI

Ever since leaded gas went away I've only seen black tailpipes. I don't
think the Muir tailpipe colors apply any more. The spark plug check
still seems to work for the ceramic part of the plug. The outer metal
ring usually looks sooty to me no matter now rich or lean the mixture
is.

Have fun.

&gt; My exhaust has been quite black when I was using the 28 PICT.  It was black it the tail pipes and on the spark plugs. There are only about 10,000 mi on the rings and the exhaust has always been black so I'm assuming that I'm running too rich?  Is that likely?


&gt; So at this point I'll follow Muir's instructions and wipe out my tail pipes and drive my bus for about 100 mi and check the colour of the exhaust and make jet changes accordingly.  I still have the 21.5 (I think) venturi so it maybe that I'll have to hone that out to something bigger, maybe 22 mm to start, because I don't think I'll be able to locate a bigger venturi.
&gt; 
&gt; Advice appreciated.
