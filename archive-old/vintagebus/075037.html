Sorry to burst the bubble... but there are NO incorrect bolts at this
time... hell, I'm even re-nutting the transaxle and getting rid of those
BAD nyloc things.  :-)

But remember, it WILL NOT see the light day until those felts are
found!!!

Bart Daugherty thought he had me when he said:
&quot;It's rumored that David Mayes has one..... It would be perfect, but it
has 
one incorrect bolt holding the front beam on. &lt;giggle&gt;&quot;

Don't forget about those divider felts!
