&gt; PS
&gt; If there are any Japanese bus people lurking
&gt; on this list I'd love to hear from you and apologize
&gt; for the idiocy of the last few days.

Some already know this, but for the benefit of those like the guy who brought
this thread up again ;-), when the OACVWDP (&quot;Doc Project&quot;) first started
I received a number of emails from Japanese VW owners in appreciation of the
site.  Turns out documentation is way harder to find over there than it is over
here.  The reason I even mention it is simply this -- I feel for those
hobbyists that can't afford the 30-window CHD fire-tow-westy bus (with gas 
heater and chrome hubcaps!), but those buses are really being taken care of
over there.  If the same money was spent fixing 'em up _here_, the situation 
would be exactly the same, except it would be those damned people in the rust 
belt driving up prices ;-)

AFAIK there aren't any Japanese on the list, in retrospect I'm kind of curious
how anybody over there found out about the site...?

Point being: without the Japanese, people would still find something to b*tch
at :-)  In the meantime, these conspiracy theories give me a good laugh! 
Fridays are the best days...
