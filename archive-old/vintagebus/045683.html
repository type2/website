&lt;&lt; Was there ever a bike rack made for a bus?&gt;&gt;
Hi Stuart&amp;Sherri,
Not as far as we know!  The best place to put one would probably be on the 
front bumper.  That way access to the engine would not suffer, and would help 
with evening out the wieght ratio on the front/rear wheels.  Of course this 
would not be advisable for constant use, but for those long trips.

&lt;&lt; Also, what do I use to secure the vent wing window frame tab to the vent 
wing tab on the door body?  right now I have a rivet in there! &gt;&gt;
Vw used a rivet as far back as the early 1950s there!  Eric&amp;Barb
