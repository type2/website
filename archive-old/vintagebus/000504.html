&lt;&lt; Can i get some opinions on who has the best skylight rubber out there?
 What have you all installed and what were your thoughts on how it
 installed, lasted and kept out H2O.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mattew,
We have not done skylights yet, but Wolfsburg West seems to have rubber that 
is more supple than others.  Still any rubber seal has to have sealant 
installed with it to keep the water out.  Eric&amp;Barb
