Subject: RE: [VB] '65 Bug in Distress/helpin hippies update

From: Gene Cornelius [mailto:mizamook_at_starband_dot_net]

&gt;There is a young man by the name of Gravy who I met recently, with a
&gt;beautiful Sea-Blue '65 Beetle.  I gave him my number and instructions to
&gt;call for assistance if needed....

Me too.

&gt;He's in Visalia, at an aquaintance's place...the number where at least a
&gt;message can be left for him is:  (619) 339-2502  (Ted's place).  Ask for or
&gt;leave a message for Gravy.  Ted, et al, are just helping as they can.

I'm in Visalia too.  See &quot;helpin' hippies&quot; thread.  The people you are
mentioning are in my larger circle of friends.

I was supposed to get a call from him Saturday.  Sunday morning my friend
Valerie who introduced us said that Gravy was eating everyone he came across
out of house and home, then becoming belligerant, making sexist/racial
comments
to the girls who were putting him up and had pretty much burned the bridges
of
the network of people who had connected me to him.  I was all ready to help
this kid.

&gt;He does not have much money, so this is a Karma deal!

This is a bad karma deal. Stay away from this kid, he is/has wasted our
time.
This is not a &quot;flower child&quot; this a manipulating a-hole who thinks the
world owes him something.

Billy
