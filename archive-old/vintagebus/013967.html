Well, I told ya not to cash it until the 15th; my welfare check doesn't come

&gt; Unfortunately, Thom, your check came back &quot;insufficient funds&quot;.  I tore it up and ended up trading the Bus for a carton of Slim Jims and a can of squeeze cheese.  The buyer did not want the NOS parts so I threw them away.  Luckily today is bulk trash pickup, those NOS body panels are too big to fit in my trash can.
