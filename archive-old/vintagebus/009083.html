I don't have any experience with &quot;ALL METAL&quot;, but have plenty with a couple
of similar products.

When I was building jigs and templates at Boeing back in the '50s, we did
revisions and repairs using DEVCON &quot;Liquid Steel&quot;.  This is a 2-part product
with a very high metal content.  We'd plug holes in drill jigs with this
stuff, drill new holes in it after it cured, and press in steel drill
bushings.  The bushings stayed tight and true in production settings where
they were subjected to very high heat and torsional stresses.

A similar product is &quot;MarineTex&quot;.  This is also a 2-part product that is
used often to repair outboard engine crankcases, etc., along with pump
casings, exhaust manifolds, etc.  It's extremely tough and can be machined.

FWIW.....

the aluminium filler refered to is ALL METAL
available at any auto paint store

an inside joke, &quot;this car has no bondo&quot; it's all metal (hence the name),
in a sense is true, buyer beware, a good scam with the
slam, bam  resto whores, pawning there vehicals off as metal finished.

&gt; On top of all of those options, why don't you try using aluminum
filler?
Made
&gt; of real aluminum, and polymers. Sands smooth, bonds like only a metal
can
and
&gt; takes paint like a pro!

What product are you refering to?  Lab-Metal (one part product) or
aluminum
fillers added to poyester resin (two part products - three with the
aluminum
filler - like West System with 420 Aluminum Powder among many others)?
I
would agree that aluminum in body fillers probably would add strength
to the
cured material (making it more machinable) and add protection from UV.
I
wonder if it actually makes the bond to the substrate better.  The only
thing
I see doing bonding is a mechanical bond of the polyester resin to the
substrate (which, granted, is pretty strong).  Perhaps the aluminum
adds some
chemical bonding (I am skeptical) or perhaps the aluminum makes the
mechanical bond of the polyester resin stonger?  Perhaps I am not
refering to
the product you use.
