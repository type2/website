 point him in the right direction?&gt;&gt;
 
Hi Lori and Andrew,
Have them call Butch at Bear's VW machine in San Diego at (619) 691-8385 and 
please tell them we said&quot;Hi.&quot;.  They are the only engine rebuild shop we 
would trust to build one for us that we know of right now.   Eric&amp;Barb
