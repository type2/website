Subject: re;rust stuff,  trannys and engines

tom doesn't know of or hasn't heard of MIRACHEM 250 a none toxic rust
inhibitor
that's safe to the environment, you could drink it, used it for years in
the 356 porsche resto business that i had before switching to vw's it's
been made in tempe az for as long as i can remember by a gentleman
looking for something safe to use on his personal collection, look it up
at www. mirachem_dot_com for more info the best stuff i have ever used in
the last 12 years.
michael, i sell rebuilt bus up to 67 type 2 trannys with a 3.88 ring and
pinion for $425.00
exchange, deduct $75.00 for stock ring and pinion, average labor to swap
axles and rebuild reduction boxes $200.00-250.00, good bearings (german)
8 of them approx.
$ 250.00 or imports for about $150.00 haven't put a lot of miles on
import bearings
so can't say how long they would last, the german ones i've replaced are
at least 35+
years old so it's your call.  as for engines, i have sold an average of
1 new factory VW
1600 duel port engine a week for the last 6 months without a problem
with any of them
installed at least 15 really sweet, they are far superior to any rebuilt
stock engine and
for$1350.00 to your door if in the west how could you go wrong. there
was a $120.00
price increase on the last shipment from the factory, VW mexico knew
they have a gold mine and are taking advantage of us users in the good
ol U.S.of A.
