This week I saw an outpouring of support for a fellow list member.  Now
admittedly as time passed and we learned more about the situation we found
that the money pledged, over 1250 bucks and still coming in, was not
needed.  It might have been needed!

I felt it was best to be prepared to help if the need DID arise.  Steves
has given me help in the past and I was simply returning the favor.  Maybe
I overreacted as one list member implied, or maybe I didn't.  I really
don't care.  So many folks jumped at the opportunity to come to the rescue
in any way they could.  This is just one way I percieve this list as well
as in other ways.

A lot of folks helped me on my journey around the country, and I simply
feel I must give something back somehow, in the best way I know how.
Through being of help where and when I can.

The fact is, that much money pledged if needed was indicative to me that
several percieve the list as I percieve it, a group of folks with a common
bond that sincerely want to see the element that bonds us stay strong all
around. We love to see people travel and use their busses for adventure and
daily driving.  Trailer queens are not a part of this group.

I believe wholeheartedly in being &quot;my brothers keeper&quot; even if we only know
them via e mail communicae and posts to the list.  Simply put, there are
many of us constantly seek to make it a better world by looking for ways to
give something back, while others I hate to say constantly just take and
take and take.  To each his/her own I guess.

Last year John Andersen raffled off a bus and turned part of the proceeds
over to me to help curb the cost of my trip and help me get going again.
That money, some 600 bucks helped me do just that.  In fact I think I still
have some of it and will always have part of it.  All the same anything I
can do to help someone else out is just what I plan to do.

That amount of goodness was amazing to me, but in all honesty the fact that
all over the country I had people inviting me, this total southern stranger
into their homes, was also quite amazing.  It restored a huge amount of
faith in America for me.  There was a great outpouring of appreciation for
what I was doing.  So many of these people remain my dear friends even now,
a year and a half after my trip has ended.

My point in all this useless emotional dribble is that I am thinking of
starting a pledge fund for participating list members who are traveling.  I
have not worked out the logistics yet but I would love to have you guys
ideas.  I think a concerted effort would offer more confidence to they that
are &quot;out there&quot; than a scattered effort.  I also believe that it would help
make our dear list stronger and more participatory.

To be honest it might not be something the list wants to do.  If that is
the case then I will simply explore the possibility of starting up a &quot;Bus
Pilots Rescue Squadron&quot;.  A private group dedicated to rescuing list
members that are traveling announced distances.  I believe this group could
actually fall under the list goal of promoting the driving of one's bus.
In fact maybe someone that would normally fear such a trip would go ahead
and do it if they knew they had possible assistance along the way.

One person has pointed out to me that NEATO and LIMBO provide such a
service, but I am not sure they do it as a 'real' effort, other than the
fact they provide a booklet list of members one can take with them on the
road.  The NEATO list is never bus specific and what I am talking about
here is something tht would be BUS SPECIFIC.

The Idea so far:
These are just some of the thoughts I have.

We could build a website that lists names, addresses, e mails, and
specifics of experience whether it be type 4 engine or just 1600 engines or
both.  For example we could list on this site whether listies know FI or
just carbs.  Also for travelers from the list that are posting those ever
appreciated trip reports we could offer a monetary pledge service that
could provide a specified amount of pledge funds for folks on the road that
might need it.  Of course those funds would be pledged by members of the
BPRS.

The BPRS site would also include the most useful travelers post like a
complete &quot;spare parts list&quot;; How to use the local library to communicate
with the list; Good mechanics around the country that have assisted list
members in the past; etc.

For a member to be eligible for funds through the group they would have to
have been on the list for one year (confirmed) and would have to be a
particpating party on the list.

Think about the rules of engagement if you think this is a good idea.  If
we get enough people we might even set up a comittee of members that would
judge the cause for funding eligibility.

Tell me what you think.  I am asking for input and involvement here.  The
&quot;Bus Pilots Rescue Squadron&quot; website could be a possibility but then it may
not be.  I await your input anxiously.  In fact the $50.00 I just pledged
to Steve will be doubled and pledged to this group if it does come to
fruition.

Is this stupid or worth thinking about???

Thanks for tolerating these benevolent ramblings,
Charlie Ford
