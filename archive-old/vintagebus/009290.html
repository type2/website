&gt; Does anyone have a list of what options were available for barndoor
busses.
&gt;
I have never heard of such a list but I'd love to see it if it exists.

&gt;I've been told that M-codes didn't exist at that time, but I know that
options must have been available.
&gt;
You were told incorrectly.  Order a Birth Certificate from VW and you'll get
a list of M-codes your Bus came with, I did.  Instructions at
http://www.ploon.nl

&gt;My '52 Standard has a drivers side sun visor which I haven't seen on many
standard barndoors as well as rear corner body bumpers.
&gt;
The sun visor/mirror assembly is standard equipment on Standard and Deluxe
models.  Note the welded on mounting bracket.

The rear corner body bumpers were early Deluxes only before they decided on
a &quot;real&quot; rear bumper (March, 1953).  It could have been an option or someone
may have requested them installed or they could have been retrofitted.
