In all fairness to Clara several other people have said just
about the same thing but I haven't focused in on what was
being said here.   

The crux of the biscuit is flipping the ring gear.  The next time
you've got the differential/ring gear out of your swingaxle take
a peek under the large diff carrier bearings.  You'll see a flat
spacer/shim.  That shim is what determines how the diff will
be centered from side to side in the trans case and that is
the pinion backlash adjustment.  Rarely are those two shims
the same thickness from side to side.  Here's where you 
better  burn some incense and say a prayer.  You don't know
if the DPO who did this actually removed the bearings and
also swapped the shims from side to side when they flipped
the ring gear over or did they just yank it out and stick it in
from the other side??  You don't want the backlash too tight
on a street vehicle because they'll let you know their there 
by howling and versa you don't want a 1/2&quot; freeplay before
the pinion gear bites on the top millimeter only of the ring gear.
Those are extremes but I've seen big differences between
the sides and I've seen small ones as well.  I *always* check
the backlash and diff bearing preload on my rebuilds because
with the age of the fleet you can pretty well be sure that you're
not the first to stick their grubby fingers inside the transaxle 
and you never know whats been done. (if even done correctly!)

Good point.   In that case it may be simpler to just switch trannys right
over, as (one would hope that) the bus tranny you are getting has it set up
right.  Also- I am not sure if the spring plates on you bus are stock or have
been switched/modified.  You may have to switch the spring plates over too-
just check to make sure it has the right bolt pattern as the reduction boxes.
PS, I would check to make sure all the bolt holes are good, and clean them out
before installation- making sure the bolt will screw in smoothly.   Make sure
all of them are good- it is easier to tap oversize holes if it is out in any
case, if it is the case that that is needed.   Remember the guy whose
remaining three bolts broke cause one was missing and it fell off when he hit
a big bump!   Don't forget to grease them or use anti seize.   Hopefully the
donor bus will have the lock plate/washer set up on there for the redux bolts-
switch that over too and bend the edges up to help keep the bolts from backing
out.
. . .. . .   ..

PS //  Clara- I've been promised those sliders I need for your
trans by this week.  I'm all set up and ready to go with yours and
as soon as I get the parts I can install and deliver this one for
Nellie.  (I've got 3 others just like it to do as well !)
&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

cool!  It'll be nice to get that going again.  :)
