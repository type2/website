Oil gets discued every other day on the 911 list.  For a while, Shell
Rotella was the &quot;Offical&quot; oil, with Kedall as the &quot;unofficial&quot;   I think
Mobile 1 is now the official oil, but that's also for the water-pumpers.
The last air-cooled 911 rolled of the line a couple years ago.

The consenus is that if you have a new engine, run synthetic.  In an older
engine, it's just going to leak out and make a mess.

Synthetic oil is a pain to clean up if you spill it.

&gt;To the friendly and knowledge list members,
&gt;sorry to repost here but  was Porsche the last
&gt; aircooled engine *developed* ?
&gt; One would hardly call the mex bug a new and
&gt; improved air cooled engine with lots of R&amp;D put in it sense it left
&gt; Germany.
&gt; Hardly porschephile myself, I don't know of they put synthetic or dino
&gt;oil in the
&gt; car the last time they had a win at Le Mans.
&gt;  Dose any one know what oil did Porsche and &quot;Xbrand oil company&quot; develop
&gt;for their hi po Air cooled motors?
