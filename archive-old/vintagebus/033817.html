&lt;&lt; i know my 68 and 71 both came with rear seat belts, and they were secured
with 
 bolts that were threaded into the floor, my 67 westy also has the same 
 provisions to mount seat belts in the rear, and they are there, look original
 tucked nicely in the storage compartment under the bed? 
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Ty,
Right you are.  We just were refering that there was no info in the
instruction manual that we have that was printed in 1962 for this in any of
the types of bus of the time.  It would be a good idea to look at later buses
to see where the belts are installed in the rear and even these areas of sheet
metal could be welded/transplanted in earlier buses for maxium holding of dear
ones.  Eric &amp; Barb
