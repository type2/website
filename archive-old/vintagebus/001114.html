Subject: Help! I need a mechanic!

Hello,

I have recently moved to the SF Bay area. I just moved here from Long Beach and
I need a mechanic for my buses. I am in dire need of some transmission work and
I have no idea who to take it to. I have had an estimate for my 64'
split-window camper. I was told it would cost about $1400.00. I think this is a
bit steep. I think the transmissions should cost about $400.00 rebuilt but I
may be wrong.

Anyone in the Marin County or Solano county area know of a 'good' fair
mechanic... I have two buses and one needs a new engine {It is still in
Southern California at a mechanic waiting for the engine block}. I am sure I
will be good business for any good mechanic.

Thanks,

Michael A. Uman
