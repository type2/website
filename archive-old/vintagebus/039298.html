Subject: Kombi vs Standard
Date: Thu, 3 Sep 1998 07:02:34 -0700 

I checked out the pictures that Jeff Golden posted
on the net to show the Z-bed.

He calls the bus a Kombi, but I have my doubts.

The view of the rear seat in the bus shows more than
just the seat (looks nice!), it shows the interior panels,
and a glimpse of some color on the exterior.

The interior is a two tone along with the exterior.
This is indicative of a Standard, not a Kombi.

The Kombi's came with hardboard interior, and
single tone exterior, seats were optional, though
almost anything could be ordered.

Jeff, check the M-codes behind the passenger seat
and check the m-codes deciphering list available 
through the Type2_dot_com site.  Or post them to the 
list, as some of us carry the 'Split Screen Guide'
wherever we go and like looking up code numbers,
and have no life or job or  . . . . . . . are bored.

I've noticed that of the people that identify which model
of bus they own on their sig line, all I tend to see are 
either Deluxe's, Kombi's, or Camper's, not standards.

Are they all gone, or mis-identified?  Check your codes.

Jeff
