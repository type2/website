Subject: Re: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

&gt;   Where is Steve Harris when you need him. Somewhere there are pics and
&gt; stuff of him restoring anf making his BN4 work


Here I am..._dot_cable modem took a dive last week :-(.  

Well, while I think I have a BN-4 around somewhere, I've only worked
with the earlier (read simpler) models.  Same basic design, just not as
many safety features(circuts/relays and such).  

I've restored a &quot;Stationary 56&quot; (1960 model) and tinkered with a few
others.  Most of the problems I've ever had have been with the fuel
pump...fairly temperamental although simple in design.

T2_dot_com has all the pics and long ago listee Ron Van Ness wrote up some
good info on BN-4's.  Its all under heating.  Here:

http://type2_dot_com/library/heating/statstev.htm  (My photos)

http://type2_dot_com/library/heating/statstev.htm  (Type 2 library/heating)

Wow I just noticed all the good articles by Ron are down :-(  Anybody
have those or have Ron Van Ness's email??

Steve
