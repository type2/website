Subject: Re: [VB] Hippie Bashing

What, more hippie bashing?! Haven't we covered this already?
--------------------- Clip ------------------
Hippie bashing will soon be illegal. 
We are an endangered species.
We are currently only found at VW and Harley events.
We can't afford the big concerts anymore and have moved on to Country and
Western bars since the Hippie Joints have all been taken over by Yuppie
wanna bees.
I never figured out what they Wanna Be! 
Any ideas as to what they Wanna Be?.
