&gt;What sort of seals do these use, if any? 

Just did mine in the 67 Westy so I'll share with the list my experience. 
WCM sell the new grey &quot;outer&quot; seals specifically for the Jalousie 
windows,  can't remember the part number but if you call them and use 
&quot;early westy, camper, louvered crank out&quot; something other than Jalousie 
they'll know what you're talking about. I have a couple of these left, 
that I'd trade or sell lmk. I am not sure if westfalia installed an 
inner seal but in oregon you need one. you could use butyl or your 
favorite silcone product but I used 3M windshield set, glass shops use 
this stuff to install a window in your american car, its black and very 
sticky and comes on a role, you can get it at any autopart store. it's 
too thick in its new form so you'll need to pull it (stretch it out) so 
that its less than one eigth of an inch in diameter clean the lip with a 
good clear solvent like acetone, and stick that stuff on the lip, not 
the window, then have someone push from the outside, this stuff holds, 
and you probably wouldn't even need to use screws but I put the stock 
ones back in, drove it in one of those brushless carwashes and guess 
what no leaking, disregarding the cargo door seals of course.
