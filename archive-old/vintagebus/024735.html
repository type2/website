&gt;
&gt; All that rambling and here's the question...  : )
&gt; Does anyone besides Rocky Mtn. Motorworks sell bus covers?  They sell the
&gt; basic one for $99.75 (older catalog, hope that's still the price), and the
&gt; &quot;utlra&quot; model for $239.00.  Anyone make em cheaper?  It doesn't have to be the
&gt; mother of all car covers here, just something to keep it out of sight of mom
&gt; and dad's critical eyes.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help
&gt;

Hey Matt,

How about some cheep tarps from the local hardware.  Use two since the top one
will tend to deteriorate (especially in AZ), but will keep the one underneath in
good shape.  Tie them down real good and you're set.
