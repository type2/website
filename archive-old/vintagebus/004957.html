This is my first time posting to this list, so please excuse what must be
obvious to a lot of you volks, but I'm new to the &quot;technical&quot; side of VW
buses, and I am curious. What is a &quot;normal&quot; oil pressure/temperature for a
single port 1500cc bus engine, I mean just a range? I drove a 1967
split-window for daily 19 years (no gauges, but very well-maintained) until
it was (and I &gt;nearly&lt; was) creamed by an idiot running a red light. But now
that I've semi-fully recovered from my injuries, and found a second 1967
splittie that wasn't in &quot;too&quot; bad a shape to fix up a bit, this one I've had
oil pressure and oil temperature gauges put in to go along with its brand
new engine. Hence, I'd like to get a reference from this list to compare it
to what the shop told me and what the engine people told me, which of course
were on two different planets (the info, not the shops). Thanks.

Craig
