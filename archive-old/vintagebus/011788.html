here we go after vw howard, matt , cory and i
survived 13 hours of rain, we all were there 
thursday to strip the lot for all you fine folks 
so you could all coincide in peace next to all other, it all went up in a pool of water, hope you all appreciate the effort, jerome must not ever ment to be orginized i guess.
so after the rain finally stopped (at 3pm friday)
it was time to try to keep everyone in a strait line, no problem, till night arose, then the free for all started but thanks to the coolness of those allready there it remained pretty much under control,
you've heard the stories of drums, dredlocks, etc
but nobody mentioned the naked body painting, much cooler then privite parts piercing,the night was mellow as were the people, met more listys there then any other vw event i've been to, even
without the hats and flowered shirts we all managed to meet, the mellowest jerome yet, even
with the schoolbus load of rainbows hidden in a corner, must of got lost to end up at jerome
brought back many memories of my youth, but as kyle said the torch has been passed on.
think i found out who flame tagged my bus
stencil is on the way if anybody would like some
sunday was real mellow dig the 60s talk, the havasu gang would like to thank all attendies for 
leaving the camp so clean made the final clean-up
much easier, everyone should really thank howard
matt and cory for doing the final cleanup, i was to be trying to load my 3000 lbs of s#*t back into the panel, thank god for the roof rack i bought there, two years in a row i scored a roof rack at a decent price, another good thing about jerome,
the drive back howard allready told you about so i will say goodbye now and hope to see you all at
