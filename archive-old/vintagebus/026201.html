Stephen,

I've done the dash fix.  It can be done many ways, but I just fixed the radio
hole by sectioning in a new dash from a clip I got from a pick your part yard.

If this is all you need,  I'd recommend cutting out the whole section (radio
hole and louvers) back to good dash.  I'd also make the horizontal cut on the
flat dash top and not on the convex curve part of the dash face.  When I did
it,  I cut out the damaged piece and made a template out of heavy construction
paper.  I then traced the pattern on the donor dash.  Be aware that you need
to take some accurate measurements (from the dash top to horizontal cut, and
dash pod to left vertical cut) to make sure you put the template in the
accurate place on the donor dash.  Just to be safe, cut outside of your
template marks and trim to fit.  Due to the complex nature of the curves of
the dash, it is a bit tricky  clamping the replacement in place.  Four hands
are better than two...but I did it by my self.

Tack weld in place and by all means, alternate sides and quench with water.
Keep welding till its all solid.   It will take some time, but it can be done.

&gt;
&gt; cut a whole dash out of another bus, or just cut the radio part?
