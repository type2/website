&gt;Hey
&gt;I must be dumb.  I 'll be coming a different way this time and so no
&gt;landmarks will look familiar.  Actually none of them will look familiar
&gt;'cause last year we arrived after dark in the rain.  If I shut my eyes in a 
&gt;car wash it'd look about right.  Can you please post or e-mail a for real 
&gt;street address or link or something to Hagen Stone?
&gt;Dave

Silly me. I forgot to add the directions link in the frames version.
Now I understand what Snoopy was talking about :) If this  is not
enough let me know.
