Subject: OK ......best way to lower your bus ?
To: cal4570_at_uswest_dot_net, Ronnie_at_oldvolks_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

OK....I know this is not for the purist....

but lowered buses sure do look cool........SO.......

whats the best way to lower a bus and keep a good ride......and what shocks 
that do not bottom out .........

before the flames start.......

2-3 inches  at the most, but others might be interested in more of the &quot;lawn 
mower&quot; look

Keep the  stock tranny + RGB......
or use a type 3 tranny
or use an IRS set-up

someone mentioned they set-up a rack + pinion steering on their bus , any 
pics ?
the stock steering box  gets in the way if you really dump it ......

Any tricks on putting the rear wheels/tires on ?
on my only lightly lowered bus (2-3 inches) with flat wheelwells you have to 
let 
the air out of the tires and jack the springplates down......

Lastly any ideas on lowereing a stock bus just for the day for a photo shoot ?
I was thinking of going to home dept and getting a pallet of sand........

Hopefully this will get the list movinfg again.......

and for all those that hate lowered buses.....just remember that at  least 
they are being used and in later years can be  UN-lowered  if the new owner 
wants

Let the games begin.......
