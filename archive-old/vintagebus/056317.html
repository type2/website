Subject: RE: [VB] Problem to take off the steering wheel....sounds stupid, I know........

Make yourself a metal plate ~15cm square with a U shaped notch in the middle
of it that the steering shaft can slide into.  Then get yourself a good
puller, slide the metal plate under the wheel and pull it off.
