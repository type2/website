ok then- my 57 single cab has all ivory knobs :
e-brake,turnsignal,heater,lights,fresh air selection knob, gear shift etc
but yet it has a black steering wheel and the base of the turn signal
assembly is black......does this make sense? Are all single cabs considered
commercial? my bus has been sitting since the 60's and seems basically
untouched but it has a chrome ashtray and grey upholstery (which ive been
told are not correct). Anyway there could of possibly been a button color
option? and if you say &quot;no- impossible&quot; then is the overhead air selector
knob supposed to be black also?-----Original Message-----

&gt;Good people of the list:
&gt;
&gt;Trying to figure out if the white steering wheel is correct for my 65
&gt;Westfalia based on a Kombi.  The wheel, shifter and knob, and parking
&gt;brake handle and button were all ivory when I got the bus (very sad
&gt;shape at the time).  The bus is pearl white (L87).  I've seen L87 kombis
&gt;with black wheels and horn buttons, but they were not campers...at least
&gt;not Westfalias.
&gt;
&gt;What would have been the correct wheel color and what type of horn
&gt;button would have come on it?  I've seen three different horn buttons.
&gt;Wolfsburg crest, plain ivory with black center, and all black.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the anal retentive trivia folks.

&gt;commercial vehicles came with black steering wheels and knobs.   Passenger
&gt;type 2s came with white ones.     except for 67 knobs, which are black and
&gt;their own style.
&gt;
&gt;Now, westys are made on type 23s- kombis, but they get white wheels and
knobs
&gt;(except the 67  knobs)  Just like they get painted inside in the back,
which
&gt;regular kombis don't.
&gt;
&gt;Buses with black steering wheels get black horn rings
&gt;
&gt;buses with white steeing wheels get white horn rings
&gt;
&gt;deluxes get wolfsberg crest center section, all other get black centers.
&gt;
&gt;okay- white is not right- it is either grey (63? through 66) or ivory
(before
&gt;that)
&gt;
&gt;this does not apply to barndoors.
