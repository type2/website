Subject: RE: [VB] OCTO Feb 2002 pictures

  The American flag Emblem are made by Alex of ISP West (aka pimppride). The
cost is relative to the labor involved in making them. There are 6 stages in
the painting of them. They are automotive quality. From what I've seen a
body shop will charge 50 to 75 dollars to prep and paint a emblem, so in
reality the flag ones are a bargin.

ps. These are available from ISP West, BFY also has them, as do I (ronnie

pps. the workmanship on the prep and paint is flawless
ppps. yes you could do one yourself, as personal time is free

&quot;He&quot; was  selling one may be more for a $100, maybe someone else knows the
name.  BBB6 had one donated to the auction maybe someone there can also.

happen
&gt; to know who did it?
