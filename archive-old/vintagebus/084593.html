Subject: front wheels...link pins

Well with that recent talk of link pins and zerk fittings, I was reminded to
lube my front end. Although I have never adjusted my link pins, and am still
having trouble figuring out the diagrams in the Muir book. I'll check the
Bentley today, hopefully it will explain it better. Maybe some pics in
there.

I was wondering about my front end, which has always seemed a little weird
to me-so I started examining it more closely...I noticed when I turn the
steering wheel all the way to the left-the driver's side wheel turns a LOT
more than the passenger side wheel, almost 90 degrees. Kind of like my left
side is more flexible. This is with the bus jacked up in the air.

When I turn the wheel to the right-I don't notice a great discrepancy.


I believe this explains the rubbed spot on my frame-where the wheel probably
hits it when I take a sharp turn. 

I can't believe I have driven this long like this-got to fix it, but I have
no idea what is supposed to be adjusted.

Advice please...thanks...
