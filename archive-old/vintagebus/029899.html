&gt; I have to disagree on when that was changed.  My April 61 deluxe is SWR/BG
&gt; the SWR is showing through the BG on the roof.  Therefore the whole bus was
&gt; SWR, then BG was added to the belt line.
&gt; 
&gt; I am unsure of if they changed this and if so when. I don't know what year
&gt; the pricey 23 window was.   This paint layering  been discussed before, but
&gt; .....
&gt; 
&gt; What i am sure of is that the inside was painted the bottom colour till about
&gt; the end of 61.  There for the dash and the overhead vent and the edges at the
&gt; top of the cab door where it shows ove rthe panel is the lower colour.   I
&gt; had to replaced the drivers door, after it got hit :(, and used a  SWR door
&gt; from a SWR/BG 63, which has the top inside edge BG, a small detail, at least
&gt; it does not look patchwork on the outside, just ratty.
