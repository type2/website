Subject: Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

Hi All,

What are the pros and cons of these two methods of adding an oil filter
to a type 1 motor?

The filterpump is a good quality old EMPI item and I had it checked for
tolerances and it passed. The motor will be comng out and will be
stripped completely to find what I think may be a suspect bearing so
much of the work related to doing the full flow job is sunk already.

TIA

Michael
