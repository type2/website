&gt; I want to chime in here for just a second if I may
&gt; regarding the current thread about lack of community
&gt; and helping each other out. What you are saying is
&gt; right to an extent but I am here to tell you all
&gt; that the true spirit of the list and community is
&gt; alive and well.  Through simple posts to the list in
&gt; the past year, I have conducted the following
&gt; business:  Got a complete 75 westy with a burnt
&gt; valve for FREE from a listmember.  After using the
&gt; interior, Gave same Westy for FREE to another
&gt; listmember.  I gave away (ie FREE) a working Riviera
&gt; electric refridgerator to a fellow listmember (Nick
&gt; Barbato) because he had a Riviera, and I didn't want
&gt; this fridge to rot away in my barn. I Posted that I
&gt; was looking to purchase a gas heater for my bus,
&gt; Will Anderson came through for me with a BN4, price?
&gt; An oil cooler, a vac distributor, and a wiper
&gt; assembly from an old bus I had laying around.  When
&gt; I needed some diaphragm material for said Bn4, I
&gt; posted to the list and Markus Bahn!
&gt; emann came through for me with some Buna Rubber he
&gt; had, price: $FREE$.  The heater is now up and
&gt; running!!  There have also been a number of other
&gt; little things that Listmembers have helped me out
&gt; with which I cannot recall names for right now.
&gt; I think you are right when you talk about the
&gt; &quot;others&quot; who do not share the spirit.  However, I
&gt; take comfort in knowing the fact that in 6 months or
&gt; a year from now, those &quot;others&quot; will be long gone,
&gt; but I'd bet you a sink from a 75 Westy that
&gt; everybody I have mentioned in this post will still
&gt; be here!!!
&gt; Keep it real!!  John Baker

&gt; Hey John,
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you are saying and agree totally.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I also have noticed that it is not as much a
&gt; community as it used to be. Oh
&gt; sure people are on this list and there are lots that
&gt; offer good advice and
&gt; help, but there are others that it is NOT about VWs
&gt; and the people that
&gt; drive them. There are still a lot of people that are
&gt; passionate about busses
&gt; and the people that drive them and more power to
&gt; you! But there are &quot;the
&gt; others&quot; too.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; There are loads of really cool people on this list
&gt; that you do not hear from
&gt; much, but once you get into the camping/VW scene you
&gt; get to know them pretty
&gt; quick.  The best medicine is to go out in your local
&gt; community and hang out
&gt; with a couple VW bus brothers and sisters and you
&gt; will have enough karma to
&gt; last a year!  I am always amazed by the VW community
&gt; and the sub-culture
&gt; surrounding it, in a good way of course.  
&gt; 
&gt; Since you are in Atlanta area definitely join the
&gt; Peachstate Transporters...
&gt; I think somehow related to NEATO, but not sure.  No
&gt; dues or anything, just
&gt; cool people hanging out together.  In the summer we
&gt; hang out a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Also if you are in the south-east or anywhere in the
&gt; world actually!  The
&gt; www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com is great for VW community
&gt; information and has a
&gt; relaxed mailing list for all sorts of VW stuff that
&gt; is bus related.
&gt;  
&gt; ... There are some people into VWs to make money on
&gt; gar-bay and all that
&gt; which is sad.  But it is their right to do what they
&gt; want...  Just do not do
&gt; it around me!  Of course within any group there are
&gt; a few people who think
&gt; that way.  And they are mostly good people, but they
&gt; miss the concept of
&gt; what the bus scene is all about...  These are
&gt; usually the same people who
&gt; think The Dead were about drugs!  And of course it
&gt; one of &quot;these people&quot; is
&gt; in need of help I will gladly help in any way I can,
&gt; but I expect them to be
&gt; reaching for their wallet when I am done to show
&gt; some appreciation &quot;on their
&gt; own terms&quot; of value :)  I have not run into this
&gt; situation yet luckily.  All
&gt; the people I have helped out so far were in the
&gt; right karma zone and knew
&gt; what it was about to help a brother out.
&gt; 
&gt; And I know by now everyone is thinking &quot;hippie&quot;, but
&gt; that is not me either
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; Just keep in mind too that the internet is a large
&gt; marketing tool in some
&gt; ways and also many of the list members make their
&gt; living selling VW stuff,
&gt; which is cool by me no flame here.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now on the other hand if you want to see some people
&gt; who think junk is made
&gt; out of gold just visit a Porsche site sometime! 
&gt; Woof, used junk sometimes
&gt; and pricey too!  Good people there, just that whole
&gt; scene is a little whacky
&gt; on valuing used stuff. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Journeys,
