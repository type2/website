Subject: RE: [VB] Cylinder head temp gauge ?s

  The cylinder head temp sender is a washer with the wire attached that goes
under the plug. After repeated removal and replacement of the plugs the
washer can split. I do not know how this could effect the temp readings as I
have never figured out how it really works. I also have replacement senders
in stock.

I know Aircooled.Net sells replacement senders if you suspect that to be
bad.
I ran a CHT gauge in my old bug, and found it very useful due to it's fast
readings.

&gt; I installed a VDO CHT on my 70 westy with a 1600 SP engine about 6 years
ago.
&gt; I has always been running at an indicated 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
&gt; Now it seems to run at closer to 250 !
&gt; I do not think the engine is running any cooler.
&gt; Has anyone else had their gauge drop in readings?
&gt; BTW the CHT is much more rapid to cool off going downhill than the oil
temp.
&gt; You can see it drop 50 degrees almost instantaneously when you go down
hill
&gt; with VDO  (foot off throttle)
