Subject: Dormobile

Does anyone have any info on the early dormobiles?  say...pre-64?  I
found a 59 Dormobile in town here that is pretty nice...and its
COMPLETE!  I couldn't believe it.  All the seats are there...the water
pump, closets, stove, etc...  and its a 59! It also had the green/white
canvas.
I'll have pictures up sooner or later of it...

I didn't think dormobile started their production this early??
