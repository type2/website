the sunroof headliner would be the same stuff the reat of the headliner is- 
that white with dots vinyl stuff.  Or do you mean the sunroof itself?  think 
that is vinyly too.

 have a stock '67 21 window deluxe with a white-ish vinyl sliding sun roof
cover.  Inside it has the original headliner.  My question is.....would
vinyl be correct, or would the original (if this is not the original one)
been canvas?
