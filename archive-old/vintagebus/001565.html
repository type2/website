I _finally_ got some much needed work done on the 67 tonight.  I've been
working for almost 5 hours on it and managed to change the transaxle fluid
(not the redux boxes yet though), put on a Berg 3.5 qt sump, and changed the
oil.  I checked the torque on the redux box bolts and all but 2 were okay.
The others required a little snugging to get the wrench to click.

In order to get the filter screen to meet up with the pickup tube
(non-Berg), I had to put on an extension which consisted of a brass bushing
cut lengthwise and then rolled around the pickup tube and hoseclamped.  I
know people will say this draws air but I fill the sump clear up to the full
mark on the dipstick so it won't hurt a thing.  It's just a temporary fix
for this trip.

In order to get the Berg sump on the bus, I had to pull the sump from the
1776 (which was a $10 1.5 qt. special from a swap meet a few years ago.)  I
put on the Berg sump and the oil I had purchased for Li'l Red AND the bus
ended up ALL in the bus.  Wow - I'm not used to that!

The Porsche 356 pulley is on it's way and should be here Thursday for a
quick installation.  I also referenced the 35015 belt and picked one of them
up.  I first went to AutoZone and the gimp there asks for what vehicle and
year is it for?  I said all I know is the part number and he's insistant on
knowing the vehicle (for their computer reference.)  So I just stood there
and told the whole store much like this:  My bus is running hot.  I'm having
to do a custom modification with a smaller pulley which requires a smaller
belt.  Since this is not factory spec., it would do no good to reference the
computer because the belt it tells you will end up not working anyway.  So
he says, &quot;How long is is then?&quot;  I told him 914mm and he says how long is
it?  I repeated 914mm.  IN INCHES he exclaimed.  One of the other sales
gimps overheard this and ran to a calculator and rattled off 34 or 35 point
some inches.  Then the gimp looks at me and asks how wide the belt is.  Now
keep in mind I asked for a standard 5 digit belt ID to begin with.  I just
stood there kind of pissed off and said, &quot;Just forget it, I'll use a rope.&quot;
I walked out and drove a block to my old standby FLAPS (they specialize in
high performance Chevys and Fords) and looked around and found the belt.
Since they know me, I walked around behind the counter and grabbed the belt
grabber tool and fetched it down off the wall.

I then used the situation and circumstances at hand to praise the manager
and his right-hand man (Dan Dreesen and Jason somebody repsectively).  I
confessed I go to AutoZone 'occasionally' but that it's situations like this
that makes me remember just how cool my old FLAPS is even though they charge
more for some stuff.  They appreciated hearing the commendation and I for
one appreciate their awesome ability to improvise (using parts in a way they
weren't intended to but to your benefit).  They were the ones that suggested
I used a rack and pinion boot to cover the u-joint on a super beetle
steering yoke.  It's a trick I've used 2 times and it works beautifully.

I'll keep you all posted on how the Porsche pulley thing goes...
