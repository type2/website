Hi,

As far as cutting metal with a circular saw. I have cut up
to 3/4&quot; plate with mine by just installing a 7-1/4 inch
abrasive metal cut off blade. I used a 4&quot; cut off to slice
the sheet metal on the front of my bus. Try the circular
saw, it may surprise you.

Don't forget the eye protection!!!!! And hold on real tight.

&gt; Have a parts bus for the front nose( UN hit ) and for the
doors( no dents)
&gt; the W. Yard just put it on the driveway! I have some
questions : When I cut
&gt; it up, is there a market for  the walk through seats and
floor they sit on?
&gt; the back end I thought I could cut it in front of the
corners over the top
&gt; in 1 Big section (roof is rusted out) the cargo floor is
is good shape... I
&gt; could haul these to a swap meet  or is it a waste of my
time?  Also what to
&gt; use to cut it up ?  I know my wire feed welder will cut up
bus sheet metal:)
&gt; but I don't have a gas welder. How about a Circ. Saw with
a metal cutting
&gt; blade? I have a sawzall but I think I would snap a lot of
blades !  Any
&gt; Ideas would be a big help.       Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
