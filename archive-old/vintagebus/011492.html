Subject: Bondo opinion (fact) :)
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 1998 19:59:50 -0700

The &quot;bondo&quot; of today is great stuff, can be used thicker than the old stuff
and should not crack.  This does not mean that I use much, I prefer to work
the sheetmetal and use almost none.  
    *Listen closely:  It is better to use a little FLEXIBLE bondo than to
fill and fill and fill with primer, primer is BRITTLE.  Unless you have
played with this, you might not know what I am talking about.
Any shop  or bodyworker will know.  It is a short cut to overfill with
primer, don't do it.   A little flexible bondo is great.

I use &quot;RAGE&quot;  costs more but sands and feathers nicely.  I wait for it to
go on sale and get it for just under $20 a gallon (enough for 3-4 cars for
me)

That is my opinion.
