well,

thats about what i can call this last weekend, as i did little else.
Worked 7 hours on saturday, and 10+ on sunday.

Basic build your engine stuff.... with some type 3 to upright conversion
twists...

My girfriend helped me most of saturday, she did a great job wire wheeling
and degreasing the old engine tin.  She primered most of it, but i did the
final painting as i have done it more and i dislike runs.  of course teh
one part i didnt test fit, didnt fit... So i had to bash it to make it fit
on.  i guess its murphy's ACVW law.  Any piece of tin you don't test fit
before painting will need mods to be put on that will render the paint
chipped and ugly.

I bent the first t3 to upright dipstick adapter i bought trying to make it
exit the tin at a rational location, so i bought another and it came out
right under a screw on the tin so i had to bend it again... and of course
now its a bit loose.  I tried to loctite it but the red wouldnt dry, i
will try green tonite. I actually like the location of the dipstick with
this mod, its really easy to get to.  Sticks out right next to the pulley
instead of behind it.  Shame those adapters are so poorly made.

Since i am using the t3 upright i had to use the t3 cooler or i wouldn't
have an oil pressure sender. (when i get this engine rebuilt i will drill
and tap the case for a sender, i just didnt want to do that on an
assembled engine...)

I had to hack a slot in the shrouds doghouse for the oil pressure boss on
the cooler, so i used a doghouse shroud i had scored from a dumpster that
had been run over by a car.  Some judicious hammerwork and its good as new
(almost, hehe) Since the t3 cooler wont let you use the hoover bit, i used
some rubber weatherstrip to seal that gap, should work as well as that
bit if not better i'd think.  An acceptable compromise IMHO.

I put in the flaps, but didnt have a doghouse thermostat to flaps rod, so
i will pull it apart once i have test run the engine for a couple weeks to
add this part.

Put on my J-tubes and 4 outlet header jobber thingy.  Once i had it
installed, my friend comes over and offers me a brazillian muffler gratis,
oh well...

3 of my friends stopped by to hang out, i guess they believed my
predictions that it would run, but i had more work to do than i thought i
would... I was going on only 3 hours of sleep, so i kept goofing stuff up
and having to do it over, they were quite entertained :)  There were some
genreal highjinks, Popping wheelies on a vespa, trying to jump a manhole
cover with it and bending the rim, eating easy cheese and crackers,
planning our silly-string strategy for summer fun etc.

One of my friends even drove and got his feeler gague for the valves and
points as i couldnt find mine (garage is a flaming mess.) All of these
guys are in the local bus club, Missouri Micros, if you are in the
Saint louis area let me know... we have mini-events every month or so.

At the end of the night last night i had the following scenario:
Engine assembled, valves adjusted, timing eyeballed, sitting there ready
for oil and installation.  I am short of installing but for putting the
regulator in.

We then went to a diner for some grub, i almost fell asleep in my hash
browns, heh.

BTW, i used red intake boots, red plug wires and a red degree wheel.  I
figure 5 horsepower for every red part, so +15 there, 40 HP for the 4
outlet muffler and J tubes, and 10 hp for the 009, so i am at 125 HP with
merely bolt on mods... ;)

Take care all,

Steve
