Hi JRuck,
The main problem is that the sunroof buses had a set of belly pans under the 
cargo floor to stiffen the frame under there to prevent flexing due to the 
weaking of the roof from the hole for the sunroof.  Not having these belly 
pans results in a bus that will flex itself apart.
Probably best to just keep looking for a delux with much less rust, and use 
the one you have now for parts, pieces, and swap stuff.  Eric&amp;Barb
