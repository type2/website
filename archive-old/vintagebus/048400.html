. I know I have a full chrge on the battery but the wierd thing is that if
you jump it... it starts... its almost like it takes more then 12v to start
it or somthing... well, Anyway, the voltometer reads 12v at a full charge
(and I know the meter works too) I was thinking that mabey there was
somthing the fan belt hit when it broke.... Because I know that It ruined
my right pre-heat hose... Mabey it hit somthing else that i was unaware of.

run a jump wire from the starter into the engine compartment.   a thick red
wire, plug on the starter next to the wires to the ignition switch.    leave
bus out of gear, and jump wire to battery.  work?  no?   this eliminates the
circuit forward and back through 30 year old potentially not so great wires.


anyway,   with a voltmeter you can also check the voltage at the starter.
Disconnect the wire from the ig switch, and have a friend hold the switch in
the start position and check the juice flowing there.   checking the
potentialy not too great circuit for and aft.

also check juice at the battery using directly on the terminals, and on the
connections/etc, in case you have a bad ground or battery connection.

THis will just tell you if the starter is getting adequate juice and if the
starter will work if it gets it.

did anything get  knocked loose by the fan belt.  Maybe that is connected to
the starting problem, and maybe it is a coincidence.
