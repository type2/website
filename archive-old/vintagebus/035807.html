well, read the archves, there is tons of stuff on this.    The idea with the 
tranny is there are several R&amp;Ps available (used at different times) and also 
RGearing,    and 4th gears.     SO what size motor are you using?   1600dp,  
I recommend  using the 4.12R/P with the bus 4th and the big nut RGBoxes.    
This may be slightly higher than the bus came with (which may have been a 
4.37 r/p but you motor is going to be  a 1600dp you say, not a 40hp, and the 
motor you plan on can push a higher gearing.   SO what is you top cruising 
speed?   Well the way I see it, VW seems to put their limit at 3600 rpms for 
top/cruising speed.   I find that about 3K is the sweet spot,  and also 
engines run cooler about 2600-3000 than higher or lower rpms, (especially 
important in summer,  I think.   SO there is this formula bouncing around 
that will tell you what rpms at what speeds you would do.     I am not sure 
how that works, as it does not work with some of my experiences with taching. 
 I have no clue.       

yes, usable as daily driver if you dont need to drive 65-70 all the time

. . . . .  ... .  
since i have not driven my bus (or any split for that matter...rode in a bay 
once!) i was wondering what the big deal is over the stock tranny? i have a 
64 completeley stock undergoing a resto right now and i plan on putting a 
1600 dp in it.  i realize pushing a 3000pound vehicle whith a 40 horse is no 
fun but come  on, i dont beleive the structural design of the bus or the 
steering equipment was meant to go 85 -90 mph....especially for those driving 
the unrestored busses (that means mechanically too) sure you could slam and 
mod everything but still its kinda weired...this brings me to my question. 
volkswagen carefully designed the bus with great detail, i plan on using mine 
for daily driver...i will be using stock wheels tires the works. i know i 
wont be a speed racer but how fast (est) will i go? i do sometimes take 
longer trips (4 hours at most) on a highway whats a good cruising speed 50? 
this trips arent taken too often but i would like to know. will the tranny be 
good for daily driver use? thanks in advance---phil
