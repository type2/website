Subject: Re: [T2] Please LOOK, and tell me what you think.

If you are referring to this bus:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=263954

One of the pics shows the passenger side foot area and passenger lower
dogleg (refer to site below (A.) to see what a dogleg is) completely rusted
out.
As I have seen if a bus is rusted out there - the normal other places are:
 - Front Floor panel (3 sections)
 - Sills (both driver and passenger)
 - battery tray area (usually seen repaired with a piece of wood and
silicone)

Of course each bus has their little hiding places, and some people (like me)
aren't too afraid of rust, however if you have no experience welding, metal
fabrication and repair can be expensive, especially when there is an
excessive amount of rust.

Refer to this site to see all the different body sections available....

You may also want to post this on the Vintage Bus list (CC'd this list on

Good luck!

&gt; OK, you guys are starting to worry me now... Please go to www.thesamba_dot_com
&gt; .
&gt; Find the 66 dual port camper-style bus posted on Jan.14th from Jerome,
&gt; Idaho
&gt; and tell me what you think...
&gt;
&gt; Thumbs up... or thumbs down.
&gt; I'm planning on getting it today if the money comes in...
&gt; But, if it has rust in places that will be hard to fix, I need to know.
&gt;
&gt; Tell me what you think , and get back to me asap...
&gt; Thanks...
