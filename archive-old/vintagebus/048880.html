Subject: 67 Middle seat needed - swap for earlier version?

Hi List-

I have come to the conclusion that the middle seat in my 67 deluxe is 
not correct.  After following a couple of seat threads, and asking 
around, I suspect that I have a seat out of an earlier bus.

I know this is a long shot, but does anybody have a 67 seat they want 
to part with?  I, of course, could swap my seat (full width, good 
shape, but no grab bars or ash tray).

Any help or leads would be appreciated.
