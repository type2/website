Subject: Re: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes

I hear ya.

On the flip side, they also get flooded with:

Lowballer: &quot;Dude, I only have $500 - can you sell it to me for that?&quot;  
Clueless &quot;What's the lowest you'd sell it for?&quot;  
Clueless++ &quot;Can I give you $50 now and make payments?&quot;  
Clueless^2 &quot;How about trading 2 superbeetle bodies and a squareback?&quot;
Clueless^3 &quot;How about $150 and an Aries K - it ran great when I parked it?&quot;
Parts Hunter &quot;Can you sell me just the interior and bumpers?&quot;
Parts Hunter bred with clueless &quot;Can you sell me just the doglegs?&quot;

FWIW, when I was selling my '55 westy, I encountered each of these scenarios.
When the nice Japanese guy whipped out a stack of greenbacks, I had no
qualms about letting it go.

&gt; you can have somebody come to look at it before making the purchase and they
&gt; won't let you. You offer to send a throwaway camera to them to shoot pics
&gt; and they say they don't have time. My favorite response was YO BRO if you
&gt; like it buy it!  Have people attitudes changed that much? Are buses so
&gt; valuable that you need to just pay the price and take your chances.
