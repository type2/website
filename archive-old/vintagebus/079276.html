Subject: Re: [VB] rear bumper splash pan

For those that care

Mark Lapore (I think that's who's doing it) makes the pressed bumper slpash pans
In a couple more weeks splash pans will be available for 59 to 67 buses also from another source

&gt;Hi,
&gt;I am new to this list. I own a couple of type 2 and a friend of mine is
&gt;restoring a 56 panel and he want it as stock as possible (his choice). I
&gt;probably will have some questions in the future about that projet. My first
&gt;one is about the rear bumper splash pan. Is the bumper splash pan was only for
&gt;the deluxe or for the full line bus including the panel?
