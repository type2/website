Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Distributor issues

If so, you're at TDC or nearly so.  If not, turn the engine 180 degrees
more and the rocker arms
should be loose.
---------------------------
As screwed as this thing sounds, I think I'd start with finding TDC,
adjust the valves.
Next check the spark coil and see if the leads are connected to the right
terminals.
My 66 uses a ballast resistor; Got one?
Pull the distributor, inspect for drive slot location and the spring on
top of the distributor drive.
Check for the presence of the drive thrust washer.
Check the distributor drive gear for excessive bronze coloration.
As off beat as it might seem I've found long screws holding down point
sets and locking out advance, check this possibility.
Check for the springs on the counter weight (s) in your distributor.
Clean the top of your spark coil and down in the primary tower. Clean the
outside surface of your spark plug wires.
With the distributor out, measure the point gap at all four lobe high
points, could be bent or badly worn shaft.
Be sure you have the copper terminals in your distributor cap, solid core
spark plug wires, that the wires are getting fire (often they cut away
the stranded wire in the terminal ends).
Recently I had an engine that wanted to backfire on acceleration, the
alternator was weak and the ignition was not getting enough power to
properly operate the system.
If you can't get things smoothed out, try another distributor.
