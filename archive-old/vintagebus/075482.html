&gt;I have acquired a VDO dipstick oil temp sender new in the box but with out
&gt;instructions. [...] The dipstick sender has two terminals on it -one of
&gt;brass and one copper. I am not certain how to properly hook it up.

Either one of the terminals is for the gauge and the other is ground,
or one of the terminals if for the gauge, the other is for a light, and
it grounds through the body.

Per &quot;Electric Gauges (Temperature, Pressure &amp; Fuel), 0-515-012-123&quot; from
http://www.vdona_dot_com/Tech%20Support/Automotive/Instructionsheets.htm ,
for the senders that replace the original screw-in sender, the terminal
marked &quot;WK&quot; is for the idiot light and the other terminal is for the
gauge.  They don't mention a copper/brass &quot;color code&quot;.  These senders
ground through the mounting threads.

According to the &quot;Trouble Shooting Guide, 0-515-012-178&quot; from the same
page, VDO temperature senders read ~700 ohms cold.  You could take an
ohm-meter and measure between the two terminals, and between each terminal
and the metal body of the sensor.  You'll probably get one of two results:

Measurement     Case 1     Case 2
brass - copper  700 ohms  700 ohms
brass - case    open      700 ohms
copper - case   open        0 ohms

In Case 1, it's just a sender, not a sender+switch.  One of the terminals
goes to ground and the other terminal goes to the gauge.  It shouldn't
matter which terminal is which.

In Case 2, it's a sender+switch.  The body is the ground, the copper
terminal is for the warning light, and the brass terminal is for the
gauge.

If you're still not sure, your ohm-meter and a pot of water on the stove
will let you figure out what's going on, without risk of burning out the
sender or the gauge.
