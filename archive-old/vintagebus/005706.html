Clara,

Thank you for your advice, I'm like you in that I think calling people and
asking questions is the smartest way to approach a situation.
As you figured out from my earlier posts, I'm trying to put my bus back on
the road using what I have available. Someday down the trail I'll have more
money for a higher quality of repair, but for this year, it's going to be
pretty lean regarding budget.
thanks
John

&gt; &lt;&lt; Please, if anyone has the post with the complete description I would be
&gt; very
&gt;  grateful if you would p-mail it to me.
&gt;  I deleted mine in error and I will be undertaking that project in the
next
&gt;  couple of weeks.
&gt;  I'll be taking the center section tranny out of a '72 super beetle and
&gt;  swapping it into my '66 bus.
&gt;  I can't believe I lost those messages....
&gt;  I'd sure appreciate the help.
&gt;  thanks

&gt; =========================
&gt;
&gt; 72 super beetle- IRS.
&gt;
&gt; does it have side covers both sides?  half way through the year they went
to
&gt; 3.88 and only have one side cover.  If it has one side cover, you will not
be
&gt; able to use it.  You can use it as a cose R&amp;P to get a high geared trans
&gt; buildt though.
&gt;
&gt; I think you can swap the side covers from your swing axle trans, but you
have
&gt; to keep the ring gear and pinion sets together, just like halves of an
engine
&gt; case.  SO if you swap over the bus swing axle side covers to the IRS bug
&gt; trans you have to take the bug ring gear off the IRS and put it on the
swing
&gt; side cover so it will stay with the pinion shaft in the trans from the
bug.
&gt; I have not done this, and I dont know the dtails if adjustments need
doing.
&gt; You probably want to read that section in the bus bentley and then a later
&gt; bentley that shows the IRS stuff, and additionally call and ask a couple
&gt; trans rebuilders.  I'm big on calling people up and asking questions.
They
&gt; probably think I;m a pain, but I get info.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; remove engine from bus (if applies)
&gt; ditto bug
&gt; remove transaxle from bus (drain trans oil first)
&gt; ditto bug.
&gt; remove axles and tubes from bug trans.    ditto bus
&gt;
&gt; remove side covers (outer ring of 13mm bolts hold them in) from bus trans
&gt; (the one you are going to put in bug)  swap them side to side.  This way
you
&gt; will have 4 gears forward and 1 reverse .
&gt;
&gt; put bug axle shafts onto the trans going into bug.  use best crown gears,
&gt; measure play with fulcrums all that stuff (its in your bentley)
&gt;
&gt; install axletube, check slide of tube, use as many paper shims as needed
&gt; (usually 3, can be 1 to 5) .  make sure you install the axle tube on the
&gt; correct sides.  gett to spacing right, then take it apart and seal between
&gt; each shim.  torque only to specified torque (14ft lbs) otherwise you can
warp
&gt; things which makes leaks.
&gt;
&gt; put the bug nose cone and hockey stick on the trans to go in the bug.
&gt; new nose cone seal?  new shift rod seals?   dust covers?  axle boots?
&gt; okay put tranny in bug, put new gear oil in, put motor in.
