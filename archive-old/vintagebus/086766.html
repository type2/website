Subject: Re: [VB] Generator Woes

&gt;These would seem to be 7V, wouldn't they? It seems to me I should be running a
&gt;Bosch 6V, 45AMP, W/ Regulator attached.


6v gens produced 7v rated.
12v gens produced 14v rated.

and more amps is allus good.

i am now awaiting a bitchslap from matt r if i am incorrect anywheres!
