Subject: fuel pump

I just noticed my fuel pump leaking.  I have a 67
Westy with a 1600 DP and dual Brazilian Webers.  This
engine has an alternator with internal regulator and
this unit is jammed up against the fuel pump making it
impossible to remove without first removing the
alternator.  Is this normal or is this indicative of
an incorrectly installed alternator or incorrect fuel
pump?  Are there different styles of fuel pumps
available to allow for clearance between the fuel pump
and the alternator?  These questions are the first
that come to mind.  Anyone had a similar problem? 
Thanks for any suggestions to repair the fuel pump and
correct the clearance problem...
John Moore
