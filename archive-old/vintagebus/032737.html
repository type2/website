 I've installed a new tranny along with the differential side gears but I
 cant get the fulcrum and axle shaft in on the passenger side.. The driver
 side is in.  Is they any kind of trick????  Please help me my 66 deluxe is
 stranded on blocks.

Hm, I am going to guess that you have not installed it yet, and you are 
putting the axle shafts on the center section in preparation for putting on 
the axle tubes and RGBoxes.

remove the crown gear.   Put the fulcrum plates in it, and the axle shaft.  I 
grease the fulcrum plates, it makes them 'glue' to the crown gear and not 
fall out.  Dont let one FP slip under the axle shaft end- there should be one 
each side of the spade end.   Measure the assembly for tolerance, as per 
bentley by usiung a feeler guage and seeing the slop.  place thecrown gear on 
a work bench and left the axle shaft just slightly out from it for 
measureing- seeing thewear marks on the axle shaft where it will wear against 
the FPs?  put it there, then measure clearance.  you can even compare than to 
having the shaft set all the way down,    Anyway, minimal slop means you wont 
hav that rear end thunk, but it may involve finding less worn pieces.
Anyway, you slide that assembly into the tranny, insert the thrust washer, 
and put in the big circlip to keep it there.

are you having problems actually sliding the crown gear into place?   well, 
make sure the little spider gears are in properly- they are in between the 
two crown gears.  or do you have a vertically cracked crown gear?  or is the 
tube they slide into marked up?
