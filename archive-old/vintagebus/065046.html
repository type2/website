&gt; By far the best come along I've found is the Little
&gt; Mule.  It's expensive, but far superior to any others
&gt; I've used.  I couldn't find a retail outlet, but
&gt; there's on on eb_at_y.

Google on &quot;Little Mule&quot; and you'll find a lot of retailers.  Retail price
for the 3/4 ton model is around 170 dollars!
