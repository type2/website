Subject: Ride height - Diff torsion bars

All this talk of spring plates and splining made me remember that someone had
scanned and sent me the spring plate removal and installation from a couple of
manuals a while back. I never had posted them on my site cause I dont know the
copyright laws and etc.
One is a 61-76 clymer and the other i think is a bentley or some sort of
authorized VW service manual.  Clymer says they are marked L and R and not to
interchange them, whereas the other book says not necessary to mark them -
wont make a bit of difference.

There is in fact **different** torsion bars, maybe you have the wrong one?
Theres a 'normal one&quot; for all models,  a Fire truck one (marked with a white
ring), and an Ambulance one that is a Softer ride (marked with a Blue ring).
Also each bar demands to be set at a different angle as well. What do you have
thom? How much camber do you have right now? camber should be 40 30' 1 30'

Im sure your truck probably did its duty and carried some more then normal
loads for alot of its life thom, hence the sagging. Or perhaps your DC was
ordered as a fire truck back in the day and got the different torsion bar, got
the cert? =)

But for someone to say the bars never sagged over time is very far from the
truth, especially on a truck. Hundreds of original examples rolling around
with that very problem.

Question: That Clymer says &quot; Rear shocks are usually painted grey, front
shocks are painted black, do not interchange&quot;. Anyone know if there is any
truth to that? (regarding the paint color)

I upped the scans of the books, here they are:
