&gt; End of long trip for Volkswagen bus in Mexico

I think that they've got it a bit confused.  Buses haven't been made in
Mexico in the last few years.  All bus production is in Brazil, so my
interpretation is that VW de Mexico is simply not going to sell Brazilian
buses in Mexico any more, instead opting for the Eurovan.

Even the Mexican VW engine is an international combination, with Brazilian
cases and Mexican heads.  If the Beetle is still in production in Mexico
(and it shows little sign of ceasing) there will be an ample supply of
engines for Brazilian buses.
