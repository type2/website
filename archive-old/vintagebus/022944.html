Subject: transmission noise - found
Mime-Version: 1.0


This has been a lesson in doing things the long way...

I had assumed the noise was in the tranny.  John Hicks can vouch for what
it sounded like.

So I replaced the transmission.

No effect.

I swapped motors with the '55 westy, and drove it with the 36hp 

The noise goes away.

It's not the tranny or reduction boxes.

I put the 1600 back in, and removed the fan belt.

The noise goes away.

Put the fan belt on.

The noise (noise is too gentle - &quot;cacophony&quot; works better but is harder to
spell) comes back.

So it's a bad fan or generator - both are brand new.

Grrr.
