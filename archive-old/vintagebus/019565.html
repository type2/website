Actually, I have bought and sold a few of these...
Have paid $300 and have paid multiple thousands.
Personally wouldn't pay thousands again but they are
cool.
Manufactured by Hymer Corporation (of Western Gerany),
under the Eriba division with &quot;Puck&quot; being the model.
Similar to Ford-Mecury-Cougar. Hymer is still in
business. Still make a Puck but it's completely
different. Correct to say that this was never a
&quot;VWAG/VWOA&quot; product. They were marketed as being
appropriate for towing behind VWs and Euro- micro mini
cars. Never did I or the article of my trailer and
Westy (HotVWs 11/1998) ever indicate that this was a
&quot;VW product&quot;.
Watch for soft subflooring, interior wall/ceiling  and
cabinetry needing repair.

Actual run of the mill price (for a 1960's-early 70's
vintage) in Europe as of last Bad Camberg and before
is/was equivalent to about $1000.-$2500 USD. *plus
shipping to the USA*. Also factor in travel costs to
Europe and location of such item then finding one for
sale in acceptible condition.
Several dealers were located in the USA. More
prevalent in Canada. I have seen several including a
two-toned one that matches a deluxe. Have never seen
one that is in as good over all condition as mine. I'm
sure that they are out there. Strong encouragement to
find/enjoy them. They tow well but aren't the end-all
be-all.

As far as get rich quick goes, I have turned a few
folks onto leads for cheap scores, free info location.
In fact, there was an old lead on one in Duarte,
California that I never went after. Research an old
dude named Pico Rivera. See if he's ready to sell yet!
Let's see who's &quot;get rich quick&quot;...
Also see Brook, Oregon with no interior...

I encourage cheaper the better and strong acceptance
for any/all smallish trailers. For the money, I like
the trailer that Rich Yost has. Like the flip open
mini tent trailer with hammered surface aluminum
exterior that was at last June's OCTO meet. Single
wheelers are cool too! Unique, vintage and cheap are
the keys. It doesn't have to be a Puck to be cool.
