I don't have data for when Dormobile/Martin Walter began conversions on VW
Type 2 chassis, but I owned a 1961 English F**d full Dormobile caravan
conversion for many years.

During that time there was at least one '59 EnFo Dormobile conversion in our
area.

I suspect that Martin Walter started converting all comers as soon as they
had their design sorted out.

They put Dormobile opening tops on VWs sold in England, licensed Westfalia
to install Dormobile tops on VWs at the Westfalia factory, and bolted them
onto VWs that came to the Martin Walter factory from private owners.  They
were so adept at converting anything that rolled in I wouldn't be surprised
if they slapped a few on Beetles...

&gt;&gt;  i don't think that they did start production that early. the earliest
that i thought they did was '62.  did you check the vin #, or just go by
what the owner said? is it for sale? does it have a westfalia-type setup, or
does it have a campbox like mine  &lt;&lt;
