&gt;Anybody try these heat shrink clamps?  Looks like they would be pretty, and
after all that's what counts on a VW engine.

&gt;
Interesting concept, I don't know if I agree with their claim of it's easier
to get to clamps with a heat gun than a screwdriver.  On the watercooled VWs
I've worked on, that would not be true for &gt;1/2 of the clamps.

I guarantee joe blo in his garage can't get the heat gun to work someday and
decides &quot;A torch gets things hot, that'll work!&quot;

It seems they took a simple concept and made it more difficult.  It does fit
in with our &quot;1-time use&quot; society, though.
