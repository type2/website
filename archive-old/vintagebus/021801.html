Hi Rick,
From what we understand to install a 66 or 67 wiper motor you have to dent in 
one of the defroster vents.  We forgot to mention earlier about your one 
color only painted wires.  You should try raw egg, brake fluid or 3M's Safest 
stripper to remove the paint.  Try each on a single wire to see if it affects 
the paint and how long it takes.  The result should be paint that just wipes 
off.  When you find a successfull chemical stripper you might be best off 
taking the entire wiring harness loose up front so you can bag or bucket all 
the wires all together.  Do lay down a plastic drop cloth as you do not want 
to remove paint from you VW's body.
