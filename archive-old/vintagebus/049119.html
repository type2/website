A gas pump like that one is in my back yard. A large momento from my granparents farm. It was to be a fountain in a fish pond, but as an ecological statement, the ivy is covering it. Once a year or so the ivy is trimmed so the face can be read, but it's pretty much a tower of green. 

I downloaded some '60's VW radio ads for the bus and forgot where they came from. Anybody have the link?
