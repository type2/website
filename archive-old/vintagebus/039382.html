&gt; &gt; The biggest problem with using anti-seize on spark plugs:
&gt; &gt; It insulates the threaded section and stops heat transfer, then the plug
&gt; &gt; runs too hot.
&gt;
&gt;A fairly short one, since the antisieze is squeezed out of the thread
&gt;contact area.  The non-contact area is normally filled with air which is
&gt;an excellent insulator (better than anti-sieze).  If anything, the plug
&gt;would run slightly cooler with anti-sieze.


Jason Says:

In the computer overclocking circles people try and find ways to fill the 
small gaps between the heatsink and the CPU. Usually this is done with 
products that are expensive and made solely for this purpose. However, 
lately people have discovered that using a 99 cent tube of antisieze works 
just as good as a 20 dollar tube of Artic Silver metal heat sink compound. 
Given the evidence, I would say the the plug would run COOLER.
