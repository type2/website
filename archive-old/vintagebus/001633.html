Coming from that northern perspective that is always on the top of the
Canadian mind (just under the toque ;), I must raise a point in further
Clara-fication, and support thereof, the bench seat.  Whether it be 2/3
bench or the full plank, a far better winter experience is had by all
with a bench seat -- save perhaps if you are riding in back.  It is a
monumentally less arduous task to persuade what little heat a 1600 and
the 'cigar shaped' heater can muster to remain in that part of the bus
in which it can (almost) effectively allow vision to traverse the
windscreen and keep frost bight at bay with a bench seat.  It comes
half-sealed for you already, all you need are a couple of paper towel
cases from your local grocery store, a 24&quot; x 12&quot; piece of 6mm plastic
(preferably clear ;), a role of duct tape, your pocket knife and ten
minutes (5 if it is below zero) .... now try that in a walk-through! ;)

Bugs &amp; Things and splits...Oh, my!

&gt; for-the-record I would not have my 65 westy If it was a
&gt; walk-through.   Also
&gt; Dr.Freud drove a bench seat bus.   Walk-throughs are
&gt; un-comfortable on road-
&gt; trips.   sad.   There is something missing from your
&gt; walk-through-buses.
&gt; Reduced to making fun of my name to make yourself feel
&gt; better, with only two-
&gt; thirds- front-seat,  it is really fear of interaction, you
&gt; need that separate-
&gt; seat to convince yourself you don't need people, that you are
&gt; an island, like
&gt; that little seat-island all by itself.    I hope you get help    :)
