&gt; Good to hear that the white lithium is working for you.  Do you
&gt; notice any speeding up of the wipers as the motor first warms up the

&gt; the get go?  

I did experience a bit of &quot;warm up&quot; action. It isn't very severe. It
isn't enough drag on a cold morning to prohibit using the slow speed
which need to keep turning to make the connection again.

&gt; We were worried that the white litium would be too thin
&gt; and leak too easily past the shaft seals.  Thusly gunking up the
&gt; motor armature. 

good thought. I haven't seen any leakage so far. hopefully it will
hold up.
