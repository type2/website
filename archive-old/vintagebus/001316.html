   Well I feel like a new man tonight because I finally learned how to use
my mig welder properly.  Previously, I would get an occasional sizzling
bacon weld only to have it start pop-pop-popping on me and leaving wire slag
all over the place.  Well as it turns out, I've just not been holding my
welding tip close enough to the weld so as to get the nourishing argon gas
into the weld.  I've been scared of burning tips all this time but man, once
I got the argon down to the weld, she just sang a sizzled sort of tune -
damn near got wood over the deal. :-)

As you all know, I've decided that $85 for the Berg T4 oil cooler tin kit is
just way too much.  Since I have a big old 60 gallon air compressor to run
air tools with, a mig welder, and a few scattered brains, I figured I could
do the T4 oil cooler into T1 myself...and so far so good.

All this cutting up of VW metal seems so - well - different - or like I'm
doing something I know I shouldn't be.  It feels funny hacking up these
tins.  Yesterday I got the triangular duct cut and using an overlap joint,
clamped a 7/8&quot;extension of metal to it.
Then tonight, I decided it was time to start modifying the fan shroud.
Since I'm working at my grandfather's again, I brought along my die grinder
and the oil cooler itself for sizing purposes.  It seems that 7/8&quot; is about
the right extension - any shorter and it's such a tight fit that there is
absolutely no room for error.

I studied the fan shroud for a good 30 minutes before deciding on how to do
the cut.  Man I must have got lucky because the cut is just perfect.   Even
my grandfather remarked at how clean it was. :-)

Using some donor metal from my beat up old doghouse, I proceeded to
successfully do a butt weld on the piece that I initially cut off of the
good shroud.  I ended up with a table full of visegrips before all was said
and done but the tack welds and the spaces in between them welded up really
nice - especially after I learned how to weld correctly.  I just need to do
some griding and cut one more piece of metal to weld in and the hardest part
will be over with.  I could have cut the shroud in such a way to make the
welding easier on me but then I could tell the cooler wouldn't get a nice
flow of air.  I cut a little deeper and am successfully welding on some
contoured bits of handformed metal to cover the gap.

I'm tired as usual so I better go  -thanks for reading.
