Subject: RE: [VB] gauges - many questions

Hey Cal,
sorry it took me a day to get back to you. Unlike E&amp;B who e-mail from the
comfort of their home and have all their info in front of them, I e-mail from
work and don't! This is my CHT head and sensor info that I have red lined into
my trusty Bentleys:

I use a NAPA part, TS5550 _at_ $38, since it is widely available and it lists the
following numbers it replaces:
0280 130 012
213-758
25174210
022 906 041
022 906 041A
311 906 041A

As you can see, it covers Porsche 70-73 and 75-76. 1974 was a weird year for
VW, Porsche and Saab/Audi while they were trying to contend with the newly
released pollution control laws put into effect in July of 73.

VW T-1 and T-3 were covered 1970-1985 all years.

The sensor is a variable resistance part with a M10 X 1.0 thread. The
resistance is 1700 ohms cold and 190 ohms at 212 degrees. The temp sensor
location is a threaded boss above and slightly to the rear of cylinder #4 and
that is why the temp range is so low. The  cylinder head shroud had a 1/2&quot;
hole in it facing aft and the wire came through a small hole in a rubber
grommet. I used a 1 ma gauge with a trim pot and a paper face that I had drawn
a temp scale on and copied off into my Bentley book. Lot of work but easy to
reproduce now 20 years later.

Ray,

Could you give me some info on the 'factory sensor' for CHT. I'd like to
install same on this engine.

TIA,
cal
