Subject: 28 PCI vs. 28 PICT
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 23:30:41 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So my bus currently has a 28 PICT and I'm very happy with it.  I've been
getting 30 mpg highway (up from the 13 mpg I was getting before I heeded the
advice of E&amp;B) and my bus just seems to run grrrrrrrrrreat!  But, I do have
a 28 PCI carb that I picked up from the buy and sell a while back and
rebuilt for fun.  In my ignorance I didn't know that they were different.

Anyway,  which would be more correct for my 60 standard?

585 578,
18 03 0,

I do kinda like the idea of a manual choke.  Could I just see what jets are
in my 28 PICT and put those jets in my PCI and get the same performance (my
understanding is that they are the same but for manual vs automatic choke -
is that right?)

TIA
