&lt;&lt; Do any of you drive w/ out a gauge?&gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
We do all the time.  Keeping track of the mileage we have put on each tank 
with our log book in the 1960 panel conversion.  Plus having the reserve 
switch is the way to go!

&lt;&lt; I don't have a reserve tap?  &gt;&gt;
Since yours is a pre-1961 it is really easy.  We are considering installing 
these even in our post-1960 buses with a cable to the front seat.
