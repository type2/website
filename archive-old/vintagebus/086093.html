Subject: Re: [VB] Generator Woes

Check the generator brushes. It sounds like they're worn out. If there 
isn't any brush sticking up above the edge of the well they ride in then 
they need to be replaced. If you take a small wood stick, like a 
popsicle stick, and push down on one of the brushes that will usually 
make the light on the dash go out. If that works you know the brushes 
are the problem.

&gt;Hi there,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 1963 bus still running a 6V electrical system. It's got a 1600 single 
&gt;port engine in it.
&gt;
&gt;We took a 4th of July weekend road trip through central Oregon (desert climate, 
&gt;90+ degrees) to go camping and do some family visiting. Put on about 400 miles 
&gt;overall.
&gt;
&gt;Saw the the red (gen) light flicker a couple of times, amd finally in Warm 
&gt;Springs OR on the way back, it came on and stayed on.
