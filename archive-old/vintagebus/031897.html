I like flowers, just not on the side of a bus. It is not suitable for a 
vehicle that deserves so much respect. I to agree that the _at_#*_at_*~_at_ up paint 
jobs on alot of these so called show buses are awful as well. Who needs 
metalics, pearls, hologram and that bowling ball paint? Why can't we live in 
a world of VW colors??

&lt;&lt; I like that paint job. Much better that what I have seen on a bunch of 
show 
 cars, actually.  What do you have against flowers, huh?  How do they hurt 
 you?  Pretty flowers  :) &gt;&gt;
