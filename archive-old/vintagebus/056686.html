&gt; This has been a topic of discussion in the ABC for several years now.  The
&gt; club could undoubtedly sell more tickets and make more money (for itself
and
&gt; for charity) but we can't really come up with simple (-minded) way to keep
&gt; track of it all.  Add to that the possible complications of the winner not
&gt; being present and the club having to deal with getting the bus to the
winner,
&gt; well, advance tickets have always been voted down in favor of &quot;must be
&gt; present to win&quot;.  The closest to an exception to this that has ever
happened
&gt; was the guy who won the Hawaiian bus a few years ago: he could'nt make it
and
&gt; gave $20 to a friend who was coming.  That friend bought 40 tickets and
put
&gt; the other guy's name on them.  One of those was the winner and the person
in
&gt; attendance who was holding the tickets took the bus back to the Bay area
to
&gt; her friend.  Now that's a friend in deed!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the point is that thickets can only be purchased at the event.  If
&gt; you know someone who is coming and you trust they very much, then that's
the
&gt; only way to get tickets without actually being there.  Sorry 'bout
&gt; that........
