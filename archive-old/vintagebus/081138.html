Subject: RE: Skylight windows

Hello Everyone
 
	It is been a while since I posted a question to the list so here
goes.

	It is spring time and I have removed the cover off the old splitty
and I am fitting some new seals around the skylight windows. I have had good
luck getting in the back three windows on each side with alot heat on the
rubber and a little hand slapping of the glass to get them in. But the first
two are PIA and I cant seem to get them in. I don't want to use to much
force because the glass is rare and hard to find. Can someone tell me how
they have install these in the past what is the trick??? 
 
Thanks In Advance
Eric Lykens
65 Deluxe and only two windows away from the road. :-)
