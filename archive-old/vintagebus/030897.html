Hi All.
If your interested in the Flowers that I have [sometimes] on my Camper..They are
magnetic,, if I had my way, I would have painted them on,, but so many others
choose to voice their strong opinions that THEY AREN&quot;T STOCK,,, so ,,, I stick
them on when no one is looking, just for my own enjoyment ;-)
I had a great time at Everybus,, and will write a report sooon! 

 you can see it on Seans site

also at John &amp; Susan Fried site

They are Homemade,, out of a 24&quot; sheet of magnetic sign material.. hand cut with
a razor, and then painted with fluorescent paint!! The flowers are about 12&quot; x
10&quot; so I could cut 2/ft
Any sign shop should have the magnetic material.. 

I tried to add big sparkles to them,, also called metal flake paint,, say that
together,, METAL flake and MAGNETIC sign material... haaha!1 I wasn't
successfull the first time.. and haven't tried again YET&lt;, I fugure that you
have to let the paint get tacky then put the sparkles on,
anyways someone will figure it out!

whoops, no flowers on in this picture!

Now... for a short story!
Now you know they are magnetic,,,
The flowers go on the bus after I wash it.. and head to the campouts/shows, then
when I get home, I remove them so that the paint doesn't get sun bleached with
the flower pattern.
My neighbor passes by my house a fair bit,, and it turns out one day, his dad
overhears a conversation about the YELLOW Camper with FLOWERS, and is
confoosed,, He know where there is a Yellow Camper, but not one with Flowers on
it..... 
Then next weekend, His dad passes my place,,sees the yellow camper, and notes,,
no flowers, then the Son drives home,, just after i put the flowers on!  He
mentions to his Dad that they both just drove by the Guy with the Flower
CAmper!... and his Dad is MORE confoosed,,,he is sure that the camper he just
passed has NO FLOWERS
So, the NEXT weekend, I had just came home from a Show,, and The son drove by,,
seen the Flowers and told his Dad right away,,Drive over and See that CAMPER and
the neat flowers! 
Coincidentally, I just took them off,, His Dad drove by,, NO FLOWERS,,, and went
home.. So they got into a big argument,, The son headed out, and Passed my
place, and for the first time that he went by,,, the flowers were not on!!
hahahah!!

The next show I was at ,, the son came over and started yelling at me for
getting him in sooo much doodoo at home,, over the damn magnetic flowers!!
It was all in good fun!,,, but there was a few tense moments at his home!
