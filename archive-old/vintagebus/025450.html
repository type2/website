I don't know if this is the &quot;Correct&quot; jetting for the 34. That almost sounds
like a challange. Maybe my skins to thin.

The solution has been posted to the group before. Someone has a web site that

has the VW rag write-up on the procedures. Maybe they can post the URL
again;&gt;)

The basic cure is to open up the idle jet to 55, accelerator pump discharge
nozzle to 50, and reset the pump discharge to come in faster. You also have
to carefully set the discharge of the accel nozzle so that it goes down the
TP opening in a clean shot, not running down the sides or all over the TP.

Since the VW engine is designed to run with 28 to 30 advance, why would I
change it?

The 34 carb was designed to run with the spec dizzy. The advance curve fits
the fuel flow. If you want to use the 009, you have to set the carb up to
match it advance curve.
