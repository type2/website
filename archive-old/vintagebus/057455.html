&gt;   Yes what a total fluff job that was. I dont necesarily think vw should
&gt; pump out parts for beetles either so the premise was kinda flawed but overal
&gt; it was a joke of an article. (btw, toyota made not 1 part for my 1969
&gt; corona, nor did i expect them to). If anyone goes to any chevy drag races
&gt; (guilty), how many people there are selling shirts with a picture or a chevy
&gt; logo on them? Does this somehow devalue the mark? I just dont see it. I hate
&gt; this topic, i hate VW for it and their fluff job of an interview on it
&gt; really didnt answer any questions but rather made them look even more
&gt; foolish for 'yea we know it irritates people, our lawyers are big bad guys,
&gt; vw germany says its ok, we are doing it anyways'. They are 100% completely
&gt; wrong on the fact that we are just old vw enthusiasts as well. If they
&gt; looked into it Id bet they find out probably 50% of bug people have had or
&gt; will have a new one sooner or later. This is probably quite a higher
&gt; percentage of 'regular' car people that will ever have a vw, nothing to
&gt; stifle. I have had a new one, I will never again, thats a given. Anyways bad
&gt; topic, just makes you want to set up a vw punching bag and go to town on
&gt; them.

My next new car (actually to replace my wife's beetle which is headed for
restoration) will probably be a Honda.  It certainly will not be a VW.
Honda currently occupies the same place in the automotive heirarchy that
VW did in the aircooled era, with decent reliable cars.  VW went away from
that except in exterior shapes.  The question is, how long will nostalgia
sell cars for VW?
