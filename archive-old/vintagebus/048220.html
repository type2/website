&lt;&lt; I bought a bus steering lock and found out that the ignition switch is 
 broken and unfixable(I even tried to TIG it). Does anybody have a unit with 
 a good ignition switch(possibly with a key) that they want to part with? I 
 have everything else in good shape including the electrical and I would love 
 to use this for what it is intended.

does your steering lock have writing around the face of the lock cylinder, 
where you put the key in?  If so, you are SOL.  If not, you have a 67 SL, and 
can buy a new ig lock cylinder for a bay window or later bug and install it 
in the lock. p mail for more info if you want
