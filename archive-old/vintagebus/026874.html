 &gt;looking for used or nos seat upolstery, drivers kick panel, and middle/rear
 seat kick panels for the 56. dont  have much cash, but lots for trade. 
 &gt;
 Dammmmmmn, nice set of Buses!
 
 I'm curious, I've never really heard of someone buying or selling NOS seat
 upholstery, was this really available or did you have to buy a whole seat
 back in the day?
 
 I know Greg Noble has some NOS door panels on his '57 Standard, ooooh, 
pretty.

yes you could go to the dealer and buy new seat covers for your bus, in 
assorted stock colours.:) Nice and clean and soft and supple :)  I've seen 
some pristine stuff the OO took off a seat and stored, as well.  And buy new 
panels. I passed up an NOS drivers side cab door panel for my 61 deluxe $30 
silly me.  Also seen NOS headliners in the pretty \X/\X/\X/\X/ box, but wrong 
year for me.
