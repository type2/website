Subject: Re: [VB] sheet metal sources

Talk with Kelly.  He will tell you where to order what you need and if you
need something custom than he will help you with that too.  I bought front
floor sections from Wolfsburg and had Kelly make me a set.   I will be
putting Kelly's set in.   The battery trays are pretty much all the same
manufacturers/quality so get them somewhere local so you don't have to pay
shipping.  In Nebraska everything has shipping so use Phoenix to your
advantage

Subject: [VB] sheet metal sources


&gt; I know that this subject has been discussed before on the list, but I want
to
&gt; ask again:  Who has the best/most accurate/higher quality of sheet metal
&gt; parts for our buses???  I need a truck battery tray and a couple of front
&gt; floor sections for my '61 DC.  I don't think that these parts are going to
be
&gt; that expensive, even for the best quality, so I might as well go for the
best
&gt; I can get.  Who should I turn to??
