Hi Listies,
I had a similar experience about 7 years ago.Heading out from my cabin
in Maine to Canada for a day trip with my wife,I was expecting the usual
questions= where are you going=where do you live=are you American
citizens=so on &amp; so forth. Shortly before our trip, my wife,[who was a
smoker at the time], had heard that if you use carpet deodorizer in the
ashtray,it would help with the odor associated with smoking in a
vehicle.The guard took one look at the ashtray,my ponytail&amp;beard---need
I say more, we were detained while two of them ransacked the vehicle.
The bottom line is,we were entering a foreign country with every right
to do as they pleased. They found nothing[had nothing],we went on our
way and enjoyed the day.
