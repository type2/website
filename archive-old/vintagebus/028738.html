Subject: flywheel off...oil leaks?

Hey guys and gals
I woke up bright and early to pull my motor today to see where the oil
is leaking from.  I suspect that I have an o-ring flywheel and I didn't
put an o-ring in it.  It was leaking pretty good.
What else should I check for while I have the flywheel off??  I've done
end play already.  How can I check for case cracks?  Last time I tapped
it with a hammer after wiping the case clean and looked for any oil
seeping out...didn't find any :)
How can I tell if my cam plug is leaking?  What if it is leaking?  What
do I do to correct this problem?
I need to leave here by 4 with it...and its about 11 now....should be
plenty of time.  I'm going to go find a golf tee to plug the fuel
line...and yoink the motor out...  if someone would be kind enough to
answer this soon...that'd be great.

Thanks!!
