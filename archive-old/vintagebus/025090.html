Hi all,

I need a little help.  I'm looking into buying a VW that the supposed
current owner doesn't have any of the paperwork.  To my knowledge, I
need the VIN so I can find out (from the DMV) who really owns the car or
to find out if it is stolen. Right???  Is there anything else I need to
look into.  Oh Yeah, this is the California DMV.

Thanks,
Aaron
