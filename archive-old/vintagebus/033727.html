VW Howard and I have been talking about just that. We want to have a
camp-out in Joshua Tree where you can basically do what you want, bonfires
etc. We have been talking in July sometime but haven't worked out the
details yet, being there is no bus events on the west coast in July.

Now *that* would be an event!  I have a junk 36hp case I'd contribute -
the early cases burn *much* better!  We could fill the fire pit with
sand first, and then take the resultant class and make little trinkets.
Put them on a string with some mardi gras beads... nope, take that back -
I don't want any mardi gras bead exhanging goin' on with a bunch of greasy
sweaty bus guys...
