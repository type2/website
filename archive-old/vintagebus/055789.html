Subject: Sandblasting Prices

Just got back from showing the safari bus to the local sandblaster to get a
quote. He wants $400.00 to do the whole bus with walnut shells.  He is
charging me an extra $100.00 because previous owner  had painted stripes on
about 3/4's of the bus with house paint, said this was the hardest to take
off. It looks like there is about 5 different colors on the bus, price
includes doing both bumpers also. How does this compare with other areas?
I'm going to have him do the blasting next Wed. He said no warpage at all
with walnuts and the finish comes out great.  Check out article on BBBVI in
May Hot VW's.
