&gt;* For extra credit: what is the exception?&lt;

In 1976 South Africa produced a run splits for the African market... Not
sure how many.

The Africa trek that Thom posts about every once in a while is using this
bus.

Also this was the last hurrah for the Porsche 912, the 912E with T4 power
(err-uhhh, underpower).
