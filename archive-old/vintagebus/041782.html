&gt; &gt;So on a more serious note I have a problem with my '66 1300 Kaefer that
&gt; &gt;I am somewhat baffled by.  [...]  I notice that if I park with the drivers
&gt; &gt;side tilted to the left, such as on a street with a pronounced road crown,
&gt; &gt;I get oil smoke upon startup, which clears itself after running.  If the
&gt; &gt;car is level or tilted to the right I have no problem..never. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an idea...when you shut the engine off, most of the oil drains
&gt; back to the sump, right?  On the left side you have the oil cooler,
&gt; which is above the level of the cylinders and valves, and presumably
&gt; will have oil draining out of it.  Maybe this is how oil is sneaking
&gt; into your cylinders on the left.  Or maybe ich bin spraechen durch
&gt; meinem Auspuff and the oiling circuits don't work this way.

No they don't,but all it takes is a few drops of oil to make a lot of
smoke.  the residual oil in the bottom of the cylinders is enough.

&gt; FWIW, my friend's BMW R75/6 (2cyl. boxer) motorcycle does the same thing.
&gt; If you put it on the centerstand it starts up clean; if you leave it
&gt; on the kickstand (tilted to the left) you can keep the bad guys from
&gt; following you with the smokescreen it makes out of the left tailpipe
&gt; on startup.  I think the rings are probably a bit worn, but from
&gt; what I understand, even freshly-rebuilt, properly-broken-in BMW boxers
&gt; will do this.

My R100RT does the same thing.  When BMW first brought out the K100
4-cylinder they had a heck of a problem, since all four cylinders point to
the left.  The solution was to pin the oil control rings to prevent their
end gaps from lining up on the bottom of the cylinder.  New owners were
quite distressed that their new $13K motorcycles were smoking like a
2-stroke on startup!
