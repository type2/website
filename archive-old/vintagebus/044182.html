So I'm fairly sure the carburetor on my '66 bus is shot (the engine is a '71 engine and the carb is a 34-pict-3)  It pumps too much fuel in always, creating black smoke, black spark plugs, and no idle.  Nothing I do to any of the adjusting screws makes any difference. Here's my question, Buy New Carb or rebuild old carb??  I had already decided to buy a new one, what the hell I'm made of money (yeah right!) but then Motorworks told me their shipment of carbs expected yesterday could be up to 2 weeks late, and I need a working carb by next week for the VW Buses 'n Boats Bash in Cincinnati.  So what is involved in the rebuild of a carb and is a rebuilt carb as good as a new one?
