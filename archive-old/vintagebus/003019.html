Well folks, I did it!

Last night I had a nice conversation with Joe Ruiz and I ordered the Okrasa
for the '59 double cab.

I ended up going with a 40 hp since that is what it had originally at 1500
cc... full Okrasa kit including heads, carbs, crank, etc.  now all I have to
do is wait!

I'll keep the split case and remove the redux boxes (at least for a year or
so)

Thanks for all of your help and comments.

Now, I only have a few parts left for the resto....


BTW, what is my old 36 hp engine worth... it was running great when I took
it out... it came from a 59 beetle.  The case is # 3047914.

David
