Subject: Re: [VB] Excuse me/Splittie gun racks?

This brings up a topic I've been wondering about.  I don't believe I've ever seen a splittie doublecab or singlecab sporting a gun rack.  Since I live in the Old South maybe I should think about getting one.  Anybody have any recommendations or experiences to share?  Will an off-the-shelf gunrack do, or is it necessary to have one custom-made?    B^)

BTW you do know I'm joking?  Right?  Right?

&gt; lets just stick with the bus topic, that way we can all get along and agree
&gt; on something, right?
