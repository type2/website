&gt;You've had what I feel to be &quot;many&quot; unpleasant experiences with
&gt;dreadlocked individuals.

I don't know that I would classify any experiences as bad, just experiences.
As to dreadlocked individuals, no. I have not seen a true Rastafarian
dreadlocked person in 10 years. And he was a hell of a lot of fun. I'm
talking about &quot;dirty white boys&quot; which are todays version of punks. I used
to be a punk myself, long haired and engaging in all manner of anti-social
behavior, although I showered on a regular basis. I'm still a long hair, but
a lot tamer now. Since I'm an old f**t to them now, I get to make all kinds
of grumpy negative comments about them and their kind. One of the perks of
getting older. The old ones did it about me and now the torch has been
passed. It is a rite of passage, and they expect it when they dress up in
that costume, whether they are aware of it or not.

&gt;&gt;I have suffered
&gt;&gt; from enough vehicle damage over the years due to people behaving badly at
&gt;&gt; the end of my tow rope. I choose when and where, not them.

&gt;I've never towed another vehicle with a bus... but I'd hate to try it
&gt;for the reason you mention. It would depend on the situation.

Used to tow brokedown cars out of rush hour traffic so they and everyone
else would be a little safer, till the moron in the tuna boat I was towing
threw his 6000 lb. Buick into drive at 20 miles an hour and tore my rear
bumper and engine lid off when the hook ripped off the crossmember under the
tranny. I left the jerk where he sat. He said he wouldn't do it again if I'd
hook back up. Sure, buddy, I believe you. You gonna pay for the damage? I
reminded him that I had told him we weren't doing that in the first place,
and he said that he had thought it would start. An automatic tranny at 20
miles an hour. My little 1600 tearing it's guts out and my clutch smoking
just to get him moving and he thinks it will start. I have rope pulled
people out of harm's way with the single cab, but it has a 2275 and a
monster clutch. I would no more tow a stranger on a rope any distance in a
stock bus than I would put my hair in dreadlocks.   =)
Now, I'm towing with a 20 foot long 67 bus with a 400 smallblock Chevy
engine, a Ford 9 inch rearend, and the strap hooked to a tow hitch (but at
least it's not lowered--ha ha). If any bumpers are coming off it will be
theirs. By the way, I didn't build it, it's 15 or 20 years old, just so
there's no confusion. But, it's a nice way of towing brokedown buses from
shows and hauling a godawful assortment of spares and the like. I volunteer
to do that duty and it's probably the main reason I bought it in the first
place. No biggie. Still my choice though. Happy bussin'
