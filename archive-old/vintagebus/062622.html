Subject: Will these headlight assemblies fit a single cab??

Howdy all,

I was wondering if somebody out there could tell me if this part number for 
a type 1 headlight assembly would fit a single cab. The number is 111 941 
037C. The part number I find for the Single Cab is 211 941 037C so the 
numbers are close. It looks like it will and has the headlight adjusting 
screws in the same place. They are not mine yet so I cant just grab them 
from the seller and see if they will fit without buying them first.

If anybody knows if they will fit and can let me know I would greatly 
appreciate it.

Thanks
Kevin
