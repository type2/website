&lt;&lt;If you have not taken apart your head light switch and soldered the
riveted
connections do so!&gt;&gt;

Also read another post about this procedure.  Not quite sure what you mean.
Expected to see rivets when I pulled the switch out Sat., night, but nothing
really jumped out at me.  Considering the tone you imply by your comment,
I'm very interested in this treatment, just need to know what it is.
Thanks
