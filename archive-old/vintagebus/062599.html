Subject: Fake ambulance fan fake ?


A friend cut up a 60's westy and said I could have what was left over. He 
cut the roof off whole and I brought it home. I mentioned the air vent thing 
that was in the roof, but he didnt want it. It fit in the angled area just 
infront of the other air vents and had vents like those in a bay window bus 
on the sides of the dash. Round with slanted slots and you can rotate them. 
I took out all gazillion screws only to find thats all they are. Air vents 
to rotate and aim the airflow more towards the driver or passenger.

Kinda hard to explain, but does this make any sense and could shed some 
light as to what this is called or option number ?

Thanks,
David
