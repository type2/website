Subject: Re: [VB] dove blue on newer USA or Import car?

There is a blue I have seen on the Nissan Xterra SUV's that may be similar.  It caught my eye since it wasn't metallic and on a new car.

You may want to check that out.

&gt; First are all the Dove blues the same ?
&gt; 
&gt; this is for a 58 panel
&gt; 
&gt; then is there a modern car with the same color ?
&gt; 
&gt; I know the Dodge cargo Van that West Coast Metric uses is 
&gt; close but is there 
&gt; another factory color that is also close or the same
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
