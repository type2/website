Subject: EMAIL TO KILL CALIFORNIA SB285
Message-ID: &lt;372685DA.D9F4F72E_at_pacbell_dot_net&gt;

For those of residing in California, I am sending information for the
Califonia State web site where I found
email information to express displeasure over SB285 which now makes us
subject to losing our vehicles if they can't pass Smog Check II.
Recycling your auto is not an option.  It's paperweight time.

Let's flood the state offices with requests to appeal the bill .

Send an email to your California assemblyperson, your state senator and
Senator Mountjoy at:

http://www.assembly_dot_ca_dot_gov/acs/default
California State Assembly:  Find my district, enter your address
California State Senate:  Senators, click on the name
Senator.Mountjoy_at_sen_dot_ca_dot_gov
