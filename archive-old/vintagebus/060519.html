When you say, &quot;substantial difference&quot; do you mean better or worse.  Also,
do you run an oil sensor?  My personal feeling is that I would watch it
worse the speedometer and it would make me worry consently.  Just yesterday
there was a post about a guy that was cooler on the freeway then around town
-- knowing that, worrying about that, and thinking about that kills the fun
IMHO.  I guess my real questions is do I have to care

  I more then likely said run 30 straight weight in the winter and a
straight 40 in the summer. But now I eat my words as i am now using 15/50
Mobil 1 synthetic and have noticed (not by gauges) a substantal difference
in temps....
