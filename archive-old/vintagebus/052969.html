Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Lid &amp; Apron from RMMW's???`

Just a thought, anyone have pictures of the apron in and taking it out? I
know, kinda lame, but I don't have it on my bus.

&gt; Anyone ever bought the Rear Aprons and Engine lid from Rocky Mountain
Motor
&gt; Works?  After finding hinges to hang the deck lid I got from a 67.  I
found
&gt; that the rear apron and decklid have a bad &quot;twist&quot; in them.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have these two parts For Sale?
