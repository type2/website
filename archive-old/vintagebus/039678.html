Meredith I have got to agree with Rick I just bought a drive away that came 
originally with a 72.  I got quite a reasonable deal in my oppinion it being 
nearly never used.  (still $300.00 plus shipping)  And I love taking my dogs 
camping with me also they sleep right in the panel with me.  Many tents on 
the market much, much cheeper and hell of a lot easier to set up.

If you are just putting your dogs in it, you may want to just buy a tent
from Walmart.  You could get twice the tent for half the money.  I don't
think I would want to ruin an original tent using it as a kennel.


At a reasonable cost, I know Ha Ha!  But what I'm looking for is one that 
goes to the, um &quot;bay window campers&quot;, our 72 to be exact.
I ask you nice folks as I figure someone has got to have one and never
use it with your Split!  The condition does not need to be perfect and would 
hope the price would reflect such, we mainly want the original one so we can 
take our dogs on more camping trips and be able to allow them more sleeping 
space outside the bus, but still be contained by the flooring of the tent.  
If you have one please let me know here or at vwtruck_at_concentric_dot_net
