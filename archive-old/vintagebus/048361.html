&lt;&lt; Hello List,
 I have decided to put Safari windows in my bus.  I know there is some 
 controversy about Safari sources so I am seeking help.  If you have had good 
 service from your windows and could recommend a supplier please let me know. 
   I also need to find a source for the appropriate wipers and hardware.  I 
 don't mind paying more for a better product.  Thanks in advance.

Hey Boyd, 

If you do not live in a warm dry climate you will regret the safaris.   They 
always leak.  If you dont live in so cal or the desert SW, you do have a 
sheltered place to park it?   They always leak. My 61 has OG safaris.  NOS 
seals work good - they barely leaked for the first couple years.

originals are the best. strength and style of frame etc. BUt you would 
probably pay for a used set what a new set costs, and then have to restore 
them.  YOu can get a new set for about $400, complete and ready to put in the 
bus.  Dunno if any repro brand is better than another.  Some claimed Izzy's 
was the hot ticket, some competition or whatever the UK brand was, but later 
there would be reports of something funky, still the repro has not been 
perfected. But I never had them, so I am going off hearsay.  ANyone stoked 
with their repros?
