Mmmm, if you must use an impact driver be careful.
The threads for the bolts inside the door pillars are
in small plates that were tack welded.
Any sufficient whack may well break the weld so that
when you eventually get the bolt out the plate will go
sliding to the bottom of the pillar.
Friends have had it happen.
Using a small gas torch to heat the bolt heads often
breaks any rust as well.
An oxy torch is too strong but a torch that you use on
your pipes in winter may do the job.
I used an LPG torch.
Just be careful about how much heat you feed into it &amp;
let the bolt cool for a few hours or even over night
before you try to turn it.
Take that from me.
I found out the hard way with a set of drop
gates......

&gt; 
&gt; I prefer the penetrating oil &amp; banging method
&gt; myself... use a screwdriver or 
&gt; impact driver, and give it a few whacks every day
&gt; for a week, spinkling 
&gt; liquid wrench like holy water (as per Muir).   with
&gt; impact, sometimes to 
&gt; drive it forward, sometimes back.   With buses from
&gt; non rusty areas you 
&gt; generally can remove the screwbolts without this
&gt; extended system, especially 
&gt; the top ones, but often this helps.   A couple times
&gt; I had to torch it.   
&gt; That is why there are some scorch marks on my 61
&gt; from swapping out the 
&gt; drivers door.  
&gt; 
&gt; Since you already drilled to get the door off, I'd
&gt; do the  penetrating oil, 
&gt; and drill through with a small drill bit, then
&gt; slightly larger.  eventually 
&gt; you can peel the remnants of the bolt out.  if
&gt; you're careful, you won't 
&gt; damage the threads. the threads are the same as the
&gt; ubiquitous 13mm nuts on 
&gt; the bus
