I was thinking that this was a nice bus to have,, until I saw the starting
bid,,, and the last line in his sales pitch,,,&quot;I will not sell it to anyone
who plans on
ruining it with boom boom stereos or plans on driving it across the country.
[ed. leaves me out!] This bus deserves to be
trailered. It doesn’t have any stone chips or road hazard damage and doesn’t
deserve any. It needs to go
to someone who will take real good care of it or it’s going to stay where it
is which is a nice dry airplane
hanger. I have photos of the complete restoration process and a detailed log
book of everything I did to
it. My 18 year kid wants me to keep it so he can inherit it but he won’t
give it the care it deserves so
here it is on ebay for sale. That’s the story.
