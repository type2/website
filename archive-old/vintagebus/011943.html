Hi,
I have a '66 Westy and after changing the shocks I realized that the 
front axle was seized on the drivers side. I havn't taken it to the shop 
yet to diagnose, but I have been told king pins (link pins) and/or 
torsion bars may cause this. Can I free this up myself or is this a 
major pain in the . . .

Thanks,

Bob Margiotti
Cleveland, Ohio
'66 Westy SO44

P.S. Anyone have a good wiring diagram for this, i'm trying to sort out 
the birds nest left by the PO when converted to 12V.
