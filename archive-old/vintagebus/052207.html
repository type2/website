Subject: Re: [VB] welding aluminum with a MIG?

--part1_14c.72d00db.29735a0c_boundary

     Most of the aluminum experience I've had, has been welding transmission 
housings and taking care of cracked seams on Mercedes.  I was lucky enough to 
be able to use a spool gun.  Makes things a lot easier, although it takes a 
little while to get used to the extra weight of the spool.  If I did a fair 
amount of aluminum, I definitely go buy one.  
                                                                   Peace
                                                                      FWT
