 &gt;Caution here, if you change to an alternator, you will have to change the
 &gt;fuel pump as well to the alternator type. Or as I did, a block off plate
 &gt;and an electric fuel pump which is less expensive.
 
 
 My 1200 Beetle has an alternator w/ the stock fuel pump (I think).  Is this
 special alternator fuel pump only needed w/ 1500-1600 engines?

I have an alternator on my A case 1600sp in my 65 westy.  It has the regular 
fuel pump.  It also has *not* an alternator stand but a generator stand that 
was modified (ie ground) to take an alternator.
