Subject: safaris and shows

Hey all,
Yesterday was the first annual all VW show in Appleton, WI.  We had a
great turn out with about 100 vehicles registered....both air and water
cooled.  The 62 took first in the stock 67 and earlier class in the
first show the bus has ever been entered in.  That made me happy :)

Is there anywhere on the net that covers installation of safari
windows?  I'd like to know what it all involves.

Thanks!
Isaiah
