Subject: engine#, tail lights and Fri stuff

In the 65, my engine # is VW X 000 279, my tailights are white and red, and
everyone at work keeps asking me &quot;Have you seen the mastercard, or that 70's
show busses?&quot;

First, In muir, I don't see an X engine???

Second, both interior light assemblies are diiferent, but they work just
fine.  Any pics I've seen show just red though???

Third, I rarely watch tv, but I've seen them both, and I have question of my
own.  What's with the white trim on the windshield in the MC, and did they
borrow the idea of last person to touch the bus from Jerome?

BTW, While my wife watches lifetime movies all weekend, I play a little
game.  I untangle myself from the garage for lunch (Usually a tunafish
sandwich, chips, and a pickle).  I then sit and watch, until I see a bus of
some sort in the movie.  As soon as I spot one, I can go back to work.
