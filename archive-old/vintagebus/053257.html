Subject: Re: [VB] oil change

Hi Thomas,
Would help to know where you are located so we would know what climate you 
encounter for oil wieght choice.  Never mix wieghts or makes of oil!  To 
check the oil level never use the first pull out of the dipstick but rather 
the next two after wiping and waiting a couple of seconds betwen whiping the 
dipstick out for the second and third readings.  You will not have a filter 
unless the DPO installed one, otherwise stock will only have the strainer 
above the sump plate.  When you do remove the sump plate make sure to look 
for metal chips as big or bigger than a pin head.  If there alot of them you 
might soon have a failed bearing.  Thus the reason for the &quot;Tealeaf&quot; reading 
from the sump plate!  If you have an aftermarket full flow filter setup there 
sould be little to nothing of metal dust particles on the sump so tealeaf 
readings are not needed or possible due to the metal particles are now in the 
filter.  Stocker engine takes about 2.5 quarts and filter adapted take more 
like 3 quarts or more depending on the filter size and if there are hoses.  
When checking the oil level make sure the engine has not been running for at 
least ten minutes, the oil cooler will otherwise have some of the oil in 
still and you will over fill the engine!  Never overfill or risk blowing the 
FW seal and having to remove the engine to fix that!   Eric&amp;Barb
