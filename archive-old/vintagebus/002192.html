Hi,

IMHO, priming the pump is mostly nonsense. The pump is at
oil level to begin with. If it is a good pump, it will prime
and pressurize within 2-3 seconds of starting. You should
have lubed all the bearings with a grease or break in lube
as you were assembling.

&gt;
&gt; Well, I just finished getting my new motor put together,
and per the
&gt; Wilson book packed the oil pump with grease to ease
priming.  I've now
&gt; read a few things suggesting you should use oil, or
petroleum jelly and
&gt; not grease as grease won't break down well and could cause
problems.
&gt;
&gt; So... what is the consensus on this? Is using grease going
to be a
&gt; problem? If so, I'll pull out my pump and clean it out
before I start this
&gt; thing. If not, I'd like to know, as I'd prefer not to have
to pull the
&gt; pump off...
