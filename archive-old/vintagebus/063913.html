Subject: Re: [VB] Angle of Dangle

No, he was refering to the one thats threaded rod with a piece that hooks
over the uper shock bolt and one under the spring plate.  Looks like a
decent tool to me. I used and recomeneded the method you mentioned below as
I have no such tool.

&gt;
&gt; Is that the tool that looks like a bug jack?  Having dropped a couple of
&gt; bugs with that lousy &quot;monkey climbing a tree&quot; jack I wouldn't trust it to
&gt; hold a spring plate.  I just supported the bus on jack stands under the
&gt; torsion housing and used a cheapo floor jack to lift the end of the lever.
&gt; It didn't come close to lifting the bus off of the jack stands.
