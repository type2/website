Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Noise with Load

That's the source of the noise. .030&quot; end play means the front (that's 
the one behind the flywheel) bearing is moving back and forth in the 
case. The more you use it like that, the more it pounds out the case. If 
you rebuild the engine the machine shop will &quot;cut the thrust&quot; when they 
align bore the case. That will allow you to put a bearing with a thicker 
thrust surface back in to make up for what has been pounded and then cut 
out. If you wnat to reuse that case I wouldn't drive it much. Also, the 
.030&quot; play allows oil to run out from behind bearing like crazy. The oil 
flow will take the path of least resistance, which means more oil is 
probably running through that big gap than through the bearing. That's 
not a good thing for keeping oil pressure in the bearing.

Glad to see it's a spare. It isn't good for any trips out of town.

&gt; I'll still check my endplay to determine if its potentially a flywheel
&gt; issue (but that will be hard to determine given that the engine has
&gt; 0.030&quot;+ of endplay already and is merely a spare to get me around for a
&gt; while).
