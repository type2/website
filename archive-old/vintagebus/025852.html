Subject: shiftrod hanger, Spring or bushing?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I think that's what its called, Its the bit that bolts up directly under the 
shifter with a hole for the rod to pass through. Any way after I got my 
shiftrod out, I ended up cutting the rod itself due to the crappy HF $11.00 
cut off tool I bought. It wouldn't cut the coupler. It's welded back together 
now and looks fine. When I took the shiftrod hanger out, I went to put my new 
bushing in it only to find it didn't have a provision for one. It seems to 
have used a spring clip (poor terminology, sorry)  instead. Does anyone make 
these or should I just buy a new hanger that uses bushings? 
    Thanks to all for answering the barrage of questions I've posted today. 
Spring is bringing the good weather and I'm eager to get my bus on the road. 
Ronnie
