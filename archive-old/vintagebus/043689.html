&gt;I'm replacing the throw out on my van, and it just doesn't look right after 
&gt;I install it.  The spindle coming out of the ['70 Beetle] transmission does
&gt;not pass directly through the center of the bearing.  It passes about a half
&gt;inch above the center of the ring...is this normal?

My Dad's '74 standard Beetle had a little sleeve over the output shaft.
It was a metal tube about 1&quot;/25mm diameter with a triangular plate on
the end that mounted to the transmission with three short bolts.  I
think the throwout bearing rode on it.  If there are three evenly spaced
tapped holes around the input shaft on the transmission, this might be
what is going on.
