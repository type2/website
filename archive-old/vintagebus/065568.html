Subject: bus cover?

Does anyone make a split bus specific bus cover?  I looked on a few on
the on-line parts places websites and couldnt come across anything
specifically for a splitty.

I'm not interested in something made for a motoehome that &quot;will get me
by&quot;, was hoping fpr something form-fitting.
