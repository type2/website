&gt; Hausus christo ----------- I know that ain't spanish but that's what I

&gt; get back home by nine blocks.
&gt; Jesus! That is spanish Right ?............  Guys if a 912e with a Type IV
&gt; runs like this, Please accept my application for a funeral policy and put
&gt; in in a new 911.

The 912e is getting to be a fairly rare car, too.

It's a slippery slope.  Busses are fun and all, but the 911 is fun in
a different sort of way.  I wouldn't try to stuff a big engine in
the bus any more than I'd try to install westy cabinets and tent in
the 911.

Want more pep out of your 912e?  Replace the hoods, bumpers and fenders 
with fiberglass equivalents, and upgrade your seats to something like the  
Recaro SRD's - that's ~200# of weight savings!  Also, ditch the rear
seatlets - they're useless.

I've driven an '01 911, and I wasn't that impressed.  I think the earlier
cars had a much sportier feel.  Not that he 996 wasn't fast - it is - it
just didn't *feel* fast.

If you want *fast*, get an early 911 and install a 3.6L from a 90-97
911.  This is becoming a popular conversion.   Now *that* is a fast car.
My '77 cab does 0-60 in 4.3s in street trim.
