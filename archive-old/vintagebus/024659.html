Subject: Reduction box plugs... thanks.

I have been working on disassembling a tranny donated by a '64 type
II... and have pretty much gotten it all down except for the
intermediate housing plus the gear stacks, and the redux box assemblies.
	Last night I deplugged the left side, utilizing a slide hammer. First I
welded a 13mm nut to the center of the plug... and then I set about
modifying my cheesy JC Whipme slide hammer, which was originally
intended for body repair work. 
	The tip of the slide hammer is a cone-shaped piece designed to hold a
sheet metal screw in place. The screw, when screwed into a body panel,
anchors the tip of the slide hammer so that force can be applied to it
to pull it out and away from wherever it is... pulling out dents, etc.
	I was able to get a 10-32 machine screw though the tip of the slide
hammer without protest... great. Then I found a bolt to fit the nut on
the redux box plug, and drilled though it (#21 bit, IIRC) about 13 mm or
so. I wanted plenty of threads, since i was using such a small machine
screw to transfer a lot of force. After tapping the bolt as far as i
could, I screwed the machine screw into the bolt and the bolt into the
nut welded to the plug. 
	The plug came out fairly easily... the slide hammer is not a big one.
Maybe 10 whacks and it popped out in very good shape.
	I remember Eric &amp; Barb mentioning this technique a while back, and so I
was able to retrieve that from my memories and use it... Thanks,
people... Other listees have also mentioned the same, &lt;Fred Stoermer,
George Lyle, and Bob Hoover??? (I think that they all have said
something to that effect at one time or another)&gt;, but for some reason I
remembered Eric &amp; Barb's mention of it. Maybe it was the fact that they
said something about using newspaper to make gaskets to go between the
reduction box halves that stuck out in my mind as unique, reminding me
of those tables that you used to see at all of the Wendy's restaurants
with repros of old newspapers under the laminate...
	I wonder what I'll need to remember next...
