&gt;  &gt; Welcome me to the list! I've had baywindows for years but now have 
entered  
&gt;  &gt; splittydom.
  
... :) ain't it grand  :)
  
&gt;  &gt; Just bought a nice original owner 67 Standard here in Maryland and I 
want 
&gt; to 
&gt;  &gt; get it in shape for an extended summer trip out west.
&gt;  &gt; I'm building a bone stock motor with the exception of a torque cam and 
&gt; 87mm 
&gt;  &gt; p's and c's. I want to hook up the stock air cleaner and preheat setup. 
My  
&gt;  &gt; question is; can I use a paper filter in the oilbath aircleaner housing? 
&gt; Has  anyone done this? I've read that in dusty climates you have to clean 
the  oil 
&gt;  &gt; bath filter every 1000 miles or so and I dont want to fool with it - is 
&gt; that  so?
  
  if you are going down dusty roads, yes clean the oil bath air cleaner (aka 
 bong action) every day says VW.  But that is if you do all your driving on 
 dirt/gravel/dust and are in a cloud.  

But..... you need to clean/change the paper filter as often. Really.  

  I think the bong action one works better myself, and never 
 use paper filters.  I clean it at every oil change under normal driving 
conditions.   I was on a road trip and ran into some folks with a Bay window 
with a completely clogged paper filter- their bus was dying all the time.  
until they changed the filter (or was it knock the dust out of it?)   The air 
bath in my 61 had some silt in it when I cleaned it ..much later.  This 
wasn't even much offroad driving, just in a dusty dry area.
