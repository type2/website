The bumper guard rubber from a 356 Porsche works great for this, perfect fit. 
 It is readily available from any Porsche parts place...check the Internet.  
Wasn't too expensive when I last bought some.

&lt;&lt; I finally got the bumpers painted and they really look nice.  They will
 match my nice shinny bus :).  My question:  is it worth putting any type
 of rubber seal between the overriders and the blade on the front and
 rear bumper.  Does anybody have experience with using some type of seal
 or just leaving it metal on metal?  I realize that VW shipped the
 bumpers out of the factory without any seals but the rust between my
 overriders and the blade was pretty bad.  Thanks. &gt;&gt;
