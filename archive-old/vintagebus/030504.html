Thom,

We all owe you a great deal of thanks on this Bentley deal.
I didn't know what I was getting into when I first
started winning about paying them
$$$ for the wrong year manual.

Thanks for picking up the ball and running with it.

Thanks to all you who sighed the petition.
To all you who didn't, I'm sure you will. ;-)

Aloha
