basically I don't want much for this stuff but I would hate to toss it 
just for a lack of a dry place to store it.
-early westfalia roof hatch
-some misc early westy interior stuff-both back seat bottoms 
with hinged lid for storage,partial head liner and other misc. wood 
stuff-I don't want to ship any of this stuff,it would have to be picked 
up in bremerton,wa-cameron
