Subject: RE: [VB] Top Speed

My experience has been that, with stock gearing, you can expect a maximum
sustained cruising speed of about 65 with short bursts up to 70 or so.  YMMV

I was reading that the top speed of the bus is 60 miles
and hour?  Is this correct with a 1600 engine?  I need to rebuild the engine
