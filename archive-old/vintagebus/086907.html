Subject: Re: [VB] Trip report, vapor lock

I have a freeway flyer with a 3.88 R&amp;P, all other gears stock.

The dipstick is quite hot to the touch after a good freeway run. Don't want 
to hold onto it for more that a couple of seconds. I like to use a rag or 
paper towel to pull it. However it doesn't feel to be smokin hot.

 What gearing do you have in the tranny?

 I have a 63 DC w/ 1776  w/ kadrons/magnaflow exhaust &amp; at those
 speeds, I overheat according to my tach/touch the dipstick tests.
