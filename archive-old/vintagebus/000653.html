&lt;&lt; That money has to come from advertisers or subscribers.  

I think the only chance of a decent type 2 oriented publication would
be something like the NEATO newsletter.  And guess what?  It already exists!
If membership was larger, the resulting fundage could support a larger,
cooler newsletter.  Maybe even color pix like the one Ty Hodges
does (Cascade kombi's?).  And the classifieds are to die for!&gt;&gt;

I'm in. 

I got the latest issue from NEATO this weekend at Oktoberbus (from Dave 
Easterwood) and pulled it out of the bus last night to read it. Reminded me 
how much I missed it and the classifieds. I let my membership slide when I 
sold my splitty, but gonna renew tonight.

Lets put &quot;our money with our mouth is&quot; and support the type2 newsletter that 
is already out there! 

Dave might want to post the address again as I am at work.

Does anyone else have kids that yell &quot;Sighting&quot; when they see another bus?
