&gt; There was a study done in adjacent parts of Ohio and W. Virginia (Ohio
&gt; inspects, WV doesn't)

Actually, it is the other way around. And people in WV use thsi to their
advantage. If they have a vehicle that won't pass inspection, they get a PO
Box address in Ohio and register their car over there. I used to see that
alot, and it wasn't a hard inspection!
