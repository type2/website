Subject: engine pull (was cooked alternator)

well, it appears that the bug and bus method of removing an alternator differ
quite a bit.  Since I did not have that big socket for the fan, out came the
engine.  I figured since I already had the gas and elec. disconnected, &quot;it's
only four more bolts&quot;

Now I a question....1600DP

All that flap stuff in the fan housing...do I really need it?  I understand it
is part of a thermotsat system.  Just curious.

Now it's off to the bead blasters with my engine tin and time to replace the
TO bearing while I am at it.    Oh yeah, I guess I will replace my alternator
too :)
