&lt;&lt;  Me and a very good person, old friend and former roomy 
 of my  bro-in-law's spent most of the last two days attempting 
  to put an early  '66 trans. into his  '67 westy.  Well, the patient 
 has rejected the  transplant, it appears that the '66 came with 
 it's drive shafts a total  of about an 1.5&quot; shorter that they need
 to be.  &gt;&gt;

Huh??   I don't think that is possible as Type II axles are pretty
much Type II axles. (with some minor variations but nothing like
an inch and a half difference)  Something else is not right here.  
That '66 should be a direct bolt for the '67.  Again, minor deviations
but nothing that would preclude you from installing it.
