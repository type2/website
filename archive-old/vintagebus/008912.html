    I believe what you are referring to is a SO25 pick-up.(Pick-up with half
open lowered floor and loading ramp) .Which I believe was a Westfalia
conversion as Mr. Hawley stated.Though both of us are
more than willing to be corrected on this,I believe.However if you don't
believe let us know !!
According to the SSCV , Neato and BK book I am looking at, there were in
1965/66 over 500 pages worth of SO conversions Vw. offered !!
