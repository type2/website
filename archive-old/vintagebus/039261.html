According to the Split Guide available from NEATO:

The first two digits describe the model, in this case 25.
A seven seater, left hand drive, walkthru Samba, or better 
known as a Deluxe.  Dag nab it, the very model of my desires.

The remaining digits fall between the two listed in the guide:

August '66        217 020 467
yours                257 076 396
December '66  217 079 889

Which puts it in late '66, so could have some '67 stuff,
but not all installed in later '67's, but still registered as a '66.
The usual model change date occurred in August.
Probably should been registered as a '67.

One thing to check is for a dual brake cylinder or single.
If you need one, make sure to get the correct one, or read
the Sermons on fitting a earlier one to replace the one-year
only '67 dual.

This form of using the model number as a prefix started
in August '64

I acquired a 67 bus (well, the title says 66, but everthing else looks
67).  Anyway, the chassis number (on the fresh air vent and in the
engine bay) says it's number 257076396.  I have yet to find a book where
this number range even exists.
