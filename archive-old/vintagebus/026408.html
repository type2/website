Anyone ever heard of this? Done this?

Yes it's true. I bought a do it yourself water injection system from an old
mechanic.  I came with everything you need in one box. He swore that it worked
and even had it hooked up to a Mazda truck. He said it bumped up his gas mileage.
I don't remember by how much. I never hooked mine up and gave to someone else
to try.
