&gt; A little rant here.  If your bus is not a REAL Westfalia then do not claim
&gt; it to be one.  This ad is so darn wrong about even coming close to being a
&gt; real westfalia it is not even funny.


...you'll have to explain this one to me.  What exactly about this
submarine hatch Westy isnt a Westy?  True enough it doesnt have any real
views of the camper interior...but judging from the roof and the view in
the rear hatch of the cabinets, I'd at least assume it has westy parts on
it...

Or do you know something more about this particular bus that we dont, that
isnt explained in the ad?
