Subject: Great Canadian VW Show Aug.20

Hi to everyone, I just signed back on the list again.  The '66 is
a happy bus with new shocks.  I can mostly stay in my own lane
now, and I can even go over bumps without slowing down to 10mph
;-)

I'm just wondering if anybody is going to the show in Coquitlam
this Sunday?  I'll be there, as always, and this time I might
even pull my bus into the show area!  Should be fun
Diana

ps check out the events page at www.vwcalimports_dot_com if you want
the info on the show
