Subject: Goin to the funeral?
Mime-Version: 1.0

if anyone wants to carabus with me to Josh's funeral drop me a line.  I am
planning on leaving Thursday morning from Saint Louis.  it is 385 miles
from here to Ponca City, OK, and that ain't too far to travel for a buddy.

Let me know if you would either like to ride along or join me.  I figure it
would be nice to see a bunch of busses saying farewell to a fellow pilot.
