Hey, I had the same thing done to my panel. It had tar thick enough to
cover the ribs in the floor, and 3/4&quot; plywood screwed to it every 6&quot; or so.
I think I made more or a mess trying to get it out than anything. the floor
was completely rust free and undented till I started prying the plywood up
with a crow bar. I did find some stuff that gets the tar out though. It was
at the local parts store, I can't rmrember the name right off, but it had
an orange scent, and came in a silver can with black lettering. It was in
the engine degreaser section. I chiseled most of the tar out, then this
stuff totally dissolevd the rest. I also found that gasoline works really
well, but it's way too dangerous to use for this. A little heat is good to
get the tar scrapable with a putty knife. I'll get the name of the stuff I
was using tomarrow if you want. Maybe this helped a little.

&gt; Have Eric and Barb ever owned a 54 bus?  My 54 was coated with tar on the
entire rear floor, walls, and the drivers side of the engine compartment. 
It probably saved the bus, although the plywood floor did help keep enough
water there to do some rusting.  It is a pain to get off, so I may just
leave it there behind the door panels.  I am trying to get it all off of
the engine compartment.  Anyone have any better ideas than a razor blade
and laquer thiner?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Richard
&gt; 
&gt;  Eric and Barb probably have some 
&gt; solution with tar...good luck.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;  We do like to coat with tar the inner bottom half of the front 
&gt; doors to repel rust formation.    Eric&amp;Barb
