&gt;Hello listmembers,
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have any advice on how to remove spray paint from plastic knobs?

Just did that yesterday. I used a cotton buffing wheel on a dremel tool and
Dico (tm) brand plastic polish (Tripoli?). One word of caution ---Do not
run the Dremmel above 1/2 speed as too high of a speed causes the plastic
beneath the paint to melt!

You may need to use a more aggressive compound to get through the paint
layer but after that the Plastic polish works great.
