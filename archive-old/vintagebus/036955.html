 I'm sure they would. My brother used to work at a place that did powder 
coating.
 They can do pretty much anything you want. The more labor the more $. I 
don't 
 think I would put powder where the tire goes. Just because I'd be afraid it 
 would get chipped when mounting the tires. Then you may have a problem 
getting 
 a solid bead all the way around the rim and have a constant air leak.

do people just pwder coat the face of the wheel then?
