You guys are a hoot!  I've really enjoyed the replys to my Woman/Bus post.
The parts about cleaning tools off the seat and removing spare parts just
cracked me up.  It's like - HOW did you know I had parts in there?  :-) HA!

I like the cleaning seatbelts tip and the water sloshing in the parcel tray
reminder.  I have good window seals that don't leak because I pumped in a
lot of that sealant goo underneath - no leaks here!

On a serious note though I'm going to put in the panels before I head down
there and at least get the pilot co/pilot area looking nice.  I probably
won't have time to tidy up the rear but that will be covered in clothes,
guitar, maps, ice chest, etc.  I'm gonna be spending a few days at Dan
Kinsey's down there anyway so I'll have plenty of stuff packed.  Oh yes, the
welder has to go too so I guess I'll be creative and hide it really good.

Anyway, today's bus event was that I took out 8 - fifty pound bags of grid
marker to the local youth baseball field.  The delivery instructions said
anytime this afternoon and &quot;the gate would be unlocked and the new white
shed would be open so put the bags in there.&quot;

Well I drove up to the gate and it was locked.  A stone's throw from me was
the field with an old shot up 50's bus and an assortment of bugs.  The guy
who owns it will make plans to meet you there and never show up because he's
so stoned out his personal assortment.  Anyway, I knew of another possible
way to get there so I drove around (it was about a 1.5 mile trip) to the
other side.  There is a house that was recently constructed near the ball
field and the lawn is still a pile of rain water grooved dirt.  I put the
ebrake on and left the bus running.  I walked down a rather steep hill only
to find a nasty nasty rut/ditch that would have stopped me cold hidden in
the tall grass.  I was determined to get my delivery down there to the ball
park so I kept walking and way back along a fence line was a narrow place
where the rut stopped and old cardboard boxes, tall grass, and other stuff
just kind of built up.  If I could just meander in the right places, I could
make it about 150 feet and then slip in through an opening into the ball
park.

I went back to the bus and hesitated, looking for an easier route and then I
just said to myself, &quot;Aw what the heck.&quot;  I put her in first, drove into the
driveway of the house under construction, through the yard, along a sloped
yard (kind of scary), along the fence (going down a steep hill not meant for
driving on), drove over a couple saplings, bottomed out my belly pan a
little bit (not enough to damage it by any means cuz I looked) wound around
and presto, I was in!  I just pushed in the clutch and coasted down the hill
at a pretty good clip and rolled right up to the shed.  Of course it was
locked so I unloaded the grid marker and promptly split open a bag.  Now
I've got white powder all over the seat and floor.  At least it looks clean
now! :-)

Once the load was done, I had to go back and man, that Freeway flier trans
is NOT meant for hill climbing.  I had to stop several times and really
rip-snort that 1600 into obedience.  I was farther down the slope on the
return trip and had about 1/4 turn of the steering wheel aimed for up the
hill and I was going straight - actually sliding along!  Yikes!  I gave her
hell and just kind of &quot;popped&quot; out onto the road from where I started.

It was a wild ride and I can see the reason for why VW used such a low
geared trans in the bus.  It helps for pulling HEAVY loads and pulling
grades (thus mountain gearing in some cases.)  It's too bad a person
couldn't take a Gene Berg 5 speed and use a flier 5th gear and space the
gearing out so you would get a nice low 1st gear for those &quot;opportune&quot;
moments.  That would be suh-weet! (Or should I say SANO...)

BTW:  I tore apart our old washer and dryer and saved the electric motors
out of them.  The remnants I hauled down to the salvage yard and got $1.60
for.  I got to see how much my bus weighs with a full tank of gas and
without me:  2,750 lbs.  I didn't know they weighed that much but it's neat
that the same engine that powers the bug down the road can handle the bus
with nearly 1,000 pounds more weight to lug.  And people wonder why their
mileage suffers when they put a flyer trans in.  I think I'm getting 12 to
15 on a good day but that's still better than the old V8's I used to drive
around in.

So there you have it - honest to goodness bus driving - daily driver usage
and I guess that settles it - no trailer queen for me.  I'd ruin it in a
minute.

Later all and thanks for reading...
