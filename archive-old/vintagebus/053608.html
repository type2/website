Subject: VWoA say they own the word BUG

I received a certified letter today that said im a bad boy because I am 
using the word BUG. It looks like they are saying they OWN that word. Anyone 
had this problem? I wonder if they are going to go after Disney world for 
making the movie....A BUGs Life ?
