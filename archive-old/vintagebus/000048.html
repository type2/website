Thom,

&gt;From my personal experience, as far as the legal aspects, just build it on a 
weekend.  I was replacing a fence around a small portion of my yard, and the 
building inspector went to the school across the street, which his daughter 
attended, saw my work, and almost made me tear it down.

Good luck.

JP
