Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

http://www_dot_cajunvw_dot_com/clubcars/charles_mowrey/bus.html

I have a lowered panel, never wanted a civic, and love my bus.  Everything I
did can be unbolted, and put back to stock, so basically keep your opinions
about non-stock to yourself, because I guarantee 90% of all those busses out
there aren't 100% stock, and were never meant to be.  I mean hell, you could
buy a complete, empty bus from VW in primer if you wanted to order it. That
way you can do what you want with it.  I guess the westfalia is a Kustom,
oh, and that Binz, that's a piece of crap too I guess. Oh no, don't sell me
one of those Hebmuller's.  That was a coach built custom.  That can't be
worth anything!


Anyway,  the early rear wheelwells that don't have the lip like the later
models (my 59 has no lip, and my '64 has the lip) are harder to get the tire
out, so I keep a small bottle jack to jack down the rear suspension.  I have
not had a problem yet.  If you want to get really high tech, you can cut a
groove on the top and the bottom of the jack to make it more safe from side
to side slippage. Then just jack up your bus like you normally would, and
remove the tire.  I'm runnin 195/65/15 on a set of '66 bug rims (4.5&quot;), so
I'm on the tall side.  I am guessing that when I buy my set of 195/45/15 or
195/50/15's for the bus, it will sit even lower, but will be easier to get
the wheels off.
