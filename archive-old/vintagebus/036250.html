Listers,

New to the list, but not to the type2 group, I have a single question:

With all the talk of engine decisions, what would stop someone from putting
a great type IV engine/tranmsission into an early bus?  Too much engine bay
surgery? simply fit?

I'd love to hear about this?

oh- jeez-  a lot of reasons,

first of all, you have to do major hackage to the bus, and this would be
sorely regretted later by you and you considered a DPO by a next owner.

also-  the type IV motors are much pricier- I have heard of people putting
upright engines in 72-79 buses- like was done in euro spec ones, when the type
IV motor gves out.

parts are much easier to come by for the uprights, and many more people will
work on them

switching to an IRS tranny, while doable I am told, is a big piece of work.   

etc.    (not to mention the aesthetics)
