Subject: Replacing front rubber. Zinc primer 1st?

Why bother with zinc primer on top of the POR15? The zinc is supposed to be
used on bare metal. That is why it is called cold galvanize compound. I have
used it for about 25 years and very successfully on the windshield seal area
as well as the rain gutter. Remember Ronnie (bless his heart) told of a
certain german sports car floor that rotted out INSIDE of the Por15 once it
cracked and the water got in. I would do a layer of the zinc primer on the
cleaned up metal and then put on the Por15. Anybody have thoughts on primer
first then Por15? Anyway, dust the Por15 with some kind of primer as it gets
tacky.
I also go with the tar under the seal idea.
my 2 cents.
