Me too, Jim, but I couldn't find the photo I thought I'd saved.

That image came immediately to mind, followed quickly by a variety of other
similar European buses/vans [some of which were even marketed as &quot;Kombis&quot;].

The strangest, but except for the VW most utilitarian, were built by Renault
and Citroen.

FWIW, Mercedes currently builds and markets a multi-use van that has a
Westfalia camper version as an option - poptop and all.  Sad to say, it
looks a lot like a MoPar product even though it pre-dates the merger.

&gt;&gt;  Oddly, when I first saw the NM photos, I thought of the original Type 2
Karmann Ghia design from the 1950s which didn't go into production.  &lt;&lt;
