Hi Micheal,

I believe the 'different' engine air ducting was an option available
on all 'utes', but mainly built into buses being
sent to what VW perceived as hot dusty countries
(why does every pre 56 Aus bus have factory safaris? 8-)).

However, what we have here is a little different from what
you describe.  Here, the air is basically taken in through vents
under the brow (above the windscreen - sorta as per usual)
ducted through a 'twin skin' cabin roof and then through further
ducting to the engine bay.

The M code may have been 010?  Anthony Surie
has some pictures of a single cab with the 
option on one of his web pages at

http://www.geocities_dot_com:80/Baja/Trails/7509/ozsc.html

I have not personally seen a double cab with
this 'complete' set up here - but have seen
a few with a twin roof skin  in the cab as if they
were prepared for the option?

&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; This is directed mainly to Australian list members. I believe that Ozz
&gt; bound
&gt; buses got a different engine cooling air inlet setup than those headed for
&gt; the US and Europe. 
&gt; 
&gt; South African Dcabs got air boxes that I wrote about a while back. They
&gt; feed
&gt; air through channels riveted to the side gates and then through slots in
&gt; the
&gt; bed into the top of the engine bay. My Dcab originally had this
&gt; arrangement
&gt; in addition to the normal louvres and I assumed that all SA Dcabs were
&gt; like
&gt; this untill I went to go and measure up the airboxes on a neighbour's '67
&gt; for fabbing my own. Somehow or other in the three years that I've been
&gt; around his bus I have never noticed that it doesn't have louvres at all!
&gt; Of
&gt; the seven SA Dcabs I've seen this is the only one like it.
&gt; 
&gt; After that longwinded story the big Q. Is this the same setup as on
&gt; Australian Dcabs or is this a  one bus only oddity?
&gt; 
&gt;
