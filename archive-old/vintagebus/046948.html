Hey all,

I am 16 and am about to get my liscence. I am looking to buy a bus thats not
expensive, but runs. I saw some buses FS that are $2500. Thats ok but still a
little high-also its across the US from where I am. I live in maine, where
their are not to many buses for sale(FS) Any one got a late 50's early 60's
bus thats in New england to sell for under 2500 that actually runs with little
or no rust?

Thanks!!
Matt
