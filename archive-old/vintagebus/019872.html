Subject: Rebuilding Kingpins (Hydraulic Press question)
To: vintagebus post &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hello folks,

I am rebuilding the King Pin Assemblies on a `65 bus. 
I am looking at purchasing a hydraulic Press as needed
to remove and rebuild the king pins and bushings.

I have found 2 size presses out there 12 ton and 20
ton.  The 12 ton is about 199$ and the 20 ton is like
$360.  My question is will the 12 ton press do the job
or should I get the 20 ton. Cash and space are tight
the smaller would be great.

Has anyone done this recently and can let me know.

Thanks
ff ff
