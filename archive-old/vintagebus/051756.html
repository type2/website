Subject: Re: [VB] Split in Annapolis MD area &lt;cheap&gt;

Hey, I live in annapolis and have been on the lookout
for a split for a while and that price range sounds
right.... buuut, there is definately NOT a foot of
snow here and I will be in contact to see what I can
do about possibly taking on a new project. thank you,
and yes...pleeaase send me the contact info before
Dicks Autohaus (you'd understand the rush if you knew
the area) gets a hold on it. 
     sincerely,
        jd wilson III

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently bid on a bus on eBay. (I am not the
&gt; seller.) The selling 
&gt; price was $165. I did not win, but the winning
&gt; bidder is backing out - 
&gt; and contacted me to see if I was interested.
&gt; 
&gt; All glass, interior items (might even have a middle
&gt; seat), good front 
&gt; bumper (slash w/overriders), engine of questionable
&gt; state, wheels and 
&gt; good tires, some good sheet metal - what a deal you
&gt; say!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, the catch - it doesn't run &lt;obviously&gt; and is in
&gt; a swampy truck yard 
&gt; (probably under a foot of snow). Has a &quot;rusty front
&gt; end&quot; probably from 
&gt; sitting in said swamp. AND it is in Annapolis MD. In
&gt; other words, it is 
&gt; a parts bus and you gotta pull it outa there.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are interested, I'll send you the picture and
&gt; the seller contact 
&gt; info. (Got one response from my last post.)
