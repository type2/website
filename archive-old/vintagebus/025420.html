&gt; i went to the local welding shop and bought a 5 foot piece of square tubing
&gt; and welded a 36mm socket to it.you can brake flywheels and  rear axle 

Another nice trick is to get a used (junk) rear axle, and weld the
socket to the flat part. This is a fabulous shop breaker bar, and you
can weld a different size socket to each side, one for big nut trannys.
one for small.
