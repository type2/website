Subject: leaky redux box? NOT!

Upon closer inspection of the leaks I have eminating from my rear wheels
(67 tranny) I found that the fluid not only ate the paint off my wheels
where it leaked, but it was red. Now, to my knowlege tranny fluid is not
generally red, nor that corosive. My feeling was a brake leak. This was
further substantiated when I moved my splittie from the garage to the
back in preperation for some work on the garage itself. I did not have
the benefit of brakes during this move.

Actually this is good. I know a lot more about brakes then redux boxes.

The PO said he rebuilt the wheel cylinders, but that was several years
ago.

In my experience, it is more cost effective to just buy the rebuilt
ones. Saves time and if I get them local, I get a lifetime guarentee.

I guess they just don't realize how long I plan on keeping this bus. :)
