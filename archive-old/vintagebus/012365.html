Hopefully a simple question for any California listees..I am purchasing a bus in California ( it is titled and insured ) and I will be driving up to the great white north ( Canada ) Where do I get the trip permit and how much? Also is there a problem because I'm not switching the title in California? Thanks. Oh ya I'll be travelling up the I-5 so If you are close and at home and have hot coffee let me know. Have a good holiday Trevor
