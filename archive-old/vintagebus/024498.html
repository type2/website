Subject: RE: Dual brake system for 1955-67 bus for $50.00

&gt; You really should get the 1972 and later bus master cylinder for about $35.00
&gt; and use a rabbit resivoir on top of it.  Make a 1/4&quot; thick spacer to go
&gt; between the MC and it's mounting place.  You will have to use longer bolts to
&gt; mount the new MC and the 1/4&quot; spacer.  Shorten the brake pedal push rod with
&gt; hacksaw and file the end round again.  Move the  forward brake sender -SNIP TO END-
Howdy, Volks,

This is a good conversion, but being the anal retentive type, I hate to
see the original brake pedal push rod cut. Go to the hardware store and
buy a bolt... M8-1.25, if I remember, about 2&quot; or 2.5&quot; long... and make
the cut down version of the pushrod out of this. Round the end by
chucking the bolt securely in your drill press and gently working the
cut end with a flat file. What? You don't have a drill press? Improvise,
but be safe. Make the end round &amp; smooth. Touch it up with emery cloth
when your done with the file.

Now do the rest of what Eric &amp; Barb said.
