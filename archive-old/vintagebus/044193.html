Hey Y'all!
I have got my 66 Split Window camper purring like a kitten (well sort of), so I think I may be ready to off-load this 73 Westy that I just aquired a few months ago.  The Westy was a back up for when the 66 was not running.  Anyway, I am very interested in making an INTERESTING trade.  The Westy runs great, see Everetts's VW Plabet site for full details and photos under the 68-up Type 2 For Sale category.  Here are some things that would likely interest me: Water cooled Vanagon, Any Ghia, convertible bug, of course any split window bus also, vintage guitars, etc.  Or any INTERESTING trade will be considered.  I got the bus relatively cheap (it had a very minor problem and wouldn't run, but I fixed that) so I have the opportunity to pass on a good solid bus and not worry about losing any money in the deal.  I just sold a 75 Riviera for $2500 and compared to that bus, this one is in much better mechanical condition, and a little worse physical condition.  So that might give you a!
!
n idea of the approxiamte value.   I am not that interested in selling it for cash at this time, because when I have cash I usually just spend it on Whiskey and Hookers, well actually I usually spend it on utility bills and diapers, and I don't want to let this bus go and have nothing to show for it! Anyway, let me know if you are interested in a little good old fashioned bartering.



Peace, John Baker
