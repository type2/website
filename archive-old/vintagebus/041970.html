&gt; &gt;can I test a 6V deluxe clock in my 12V bus? Oherwise,
&gt; &gt;how can I do it other than getting a 6V auto battery?
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a REAL handy battery charger that does both 6 volt and 12 
&gt; volt batteries. I use it all the time to test items in luxery at my 
&gt; dinner table!!!!

Keep in mind that battery chargers put out quite a bit more voltage than
their rating, particularly at low currents such as that demanded by a
clock.  they are not well-regulated unless they are attached to a battery
which will absorb excess voltage.
