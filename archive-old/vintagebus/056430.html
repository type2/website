Subject: Re: [VB] Pedal Pan 

There is a difference between metric sheet metal screws and US sheet metal
screws. Metric are a finer thread. Usually phillips are metric. Which ones are
coarser thread?


&gt; Good question as I am missing a few myself.  Now here's another question:
&gt; On my '65 Single Cab all the front screws are Phillips and the rest are flat
&gt; blade type.  The two won't interchange either.  Is this normal?  I was
&gt; thinking that maybe VW used the Phillips head sheet metal screws at the
&gt; front to aid in removal.
