I am the small but &quot;up and coming&quot; auto parts supplier specializing in air
cooled VW parts.  I worked for many years at other VW parts suppliers
including WCM, and various &quot;smaller&quot; companies. When I finally became
disillusioned at the &quot;customer service&quot; at the larger company, I brought it
up to the owner who said, essentially, that if you don't like it, PISS OFF.
So, I moved my family to Washington, and started really focusing on Wolfsden.
 I had been doing it as more of a &quot;side thing&quot; up until then.
	So, that is what I do.  This is my employment.  Jenn works for a
dentist in Pt Hadlock, WA.  but not for much longer.  Cause I am gonna blow
sky high.  I am gonna be so big, she'll need to come work for me.  The second
half of this paragraph is of course BS, Jenn owns the company, we all know
that.  I work for her.
