 MESH GREY: I think the two colors of that deluxe
 interior that year were Platinum Mesh and Mesh Gray.
 
 Both were basically a solid color of vinyl on the top
 and bottom 1/3 of the panel, with a &quot;mesh&quot; sort of
 check pattern of white and the vinyl color in the
 center 1/3 Each section is bordered by a chrome strip
 about the size of a pencil.

 Mesh grey is shown there. Platinum mesh was a silvery
 (platinum) solid color with the platinum and white
 mesh-over center section.
 
 That concludes this lecture.

mesh grey was used in all 65s  for the upholstery at least, the deluxes and 
standards had the paneling too.  Also was used used in 66/67 standards.  
66/67 deluxes did not come mesh grey, they got mesh platinum if they were 
painted Velvet green/white or Titian Red/white, the Blue/white 66/67s had 
aero-baleric interior- which is a creamy white and a light metallic blue.   
The 66/67 deluxes had coloured (light blue or tan) mats on the floors and 
between the front seats and the cab doors.
