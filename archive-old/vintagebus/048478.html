Western Oregon Swappers!

A VW swapmeet is being planned for Saturday, Aug. 7, to be held in
conjunction with the Yoncalla Summer Festival.  Yoncalla is near Interstate
5, about 50 miles south of Eugene, and 30 miles north of Roseburg.

The Festival, now in its 10th year, is a well-attended event focused on
family fun.  VW's are also invited to participate in the annual Car Cruise
and Show, Saturday afternoon.

There will be ample space for at least 15 swappers, as well as room to park
&quot;For Sale&quot; cars.  There will be some interesting VW &quot;shiners&quot; to inspect,
and at least one split-window bus for sale (so far).

We would like to guage interest in this event, so please reply privately if
you want further details, or wish to participate in, or attend the Swap.
The Yoncalla Festival Committee believes that this would be a welcome
addition to the Festival's annual schedule of events.
