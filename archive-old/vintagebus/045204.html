&lt;&lt; Is it as simple as welding another threaded rod to the frame? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Could be, but if the rod is bent and/or rusted badly it probably is just best 
to get a good used replacement.  Which is not a hard part to find.  Just make 
sure that when yiu reinstall everything you put in the phenolic fibered 
washers in there to work as a friction device to keep the wing windows open 
while you fly down the freeway on too hot of days.    Eric&amp;Barb
