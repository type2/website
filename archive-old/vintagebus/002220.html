Subject: Towing Vehicle?

Anyone towed a Splitwindow Westy with a Jeep Cherokee any distance?  I found
a good deal on a 66 Westy in Roanoke Va. but renting a UHaul and Trailer
adds to much to the cost.  There's an outside chance I may be able to use a
4.0L Cherokee to tow it with and rent a tow dolly.  Anyone coming through
Va. to NC want to pick up some extra cash to tow a Bus? ;)

Dave
