&gt;Thanks NQ for bringing it up. This list rules!


You are welcome.  There are 2 plastic bushings that go into the shifter
tube.  They look like miniature badmitten birdies.  Then you have your shift
coupler back at the tranny.  The only way to replace those bushings in the
shift tube is to pull the tranny and engine unfortunately.  This is one very
important task to not overlook - if you ever have to pull the trans from a
bus, go ahead and do those bushings while everything is apart.  It would be
a neat hack to make a removeable shift rod tube so that you wouldn't have to
pull the trans to replace the bushings.
