&gt; In my case, it's called a &quot;savings account&quot;.  If you spend a little less
&gt; than you make each month and put the remaider in the savings account you
&gt; will have the bucks for the trip.  Kind of like internal energy in a heat
&gt; engine!

I've heard about this savings/live below/your/means thing, but never been
able to find a family that would sacrifice basic needs such as out of state
colleges, etc. for bus parts.

Maybe next time!!!!
