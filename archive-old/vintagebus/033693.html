Subject: RE: [VB] early front turn signals

I just went out and got the ones (front lens) from the parts box from my 57
oval and compared them to some NOS and German repo's I have and they are
exactly the same (lens only), maybe someone changed them? I know the housing
covers are different and am not sure on the bulb holder, I do have a few
different styles of those.

Hi Ronnie,
Mayhaps the repros are the same which would result in a bad fit, but the 
originals between bus and bug are differant due to the differance of the 
curvature of the 1956-57 fender and the 1955-early 61 (Used up to AUG63 for 
Euro countries?) bus nose section.
 111 953 163 (164 should be the right one.) Housing - Flashing indicator, 
front, left
                      F        ----1 600 439 (Up to AUG57 which is the start

of 1958 production.) 

211 953 163 Housing - Flashing indicator, front, left
                                   Up to chassi No. 1 144 281 (AUG63)

141 953 163  Casing - Flashing indicator
                                 Up to Chassi No. 2 103 014 (Somewhere in 
early 58 production)

The bug ones are alot harder to find than the bus ones due to being only
used 
for two years and only for USA production.    Eric&amp;Barb
