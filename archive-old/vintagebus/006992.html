Awesome custormer service. I called the people who sell the covers to Costco
(they are in Seattle) and told them about my top starting to shread, all
they asked for was a copy of my reciept and they would ship a new cover out
as soon as they get more in ahich would be november 20. Also to purchase the
new top would have been 40 dollars plus shipping.
