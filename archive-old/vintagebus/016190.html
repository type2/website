The current owner of the truck *has* a crane (that's how it got there!), but 
he's so old and frail that I don't think he can operate it, and the crane has 
been dormant for so long that I doubt it runs.  My heavy equipment experience 
is limited to D-series cats.

&gt; Hey Thom, have you looked into renting a crane? This should be MUCH cheaper and easier than a helicopter.
