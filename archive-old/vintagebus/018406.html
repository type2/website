To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have heat in my buses from April until November.
Each year it makes me mad as if someone somewhere is a
scumbag and did me wrong. Actually crawled under my
bus last weekend with a pair of Dykes and some bailing
wire. Wired the boxes open for the winter. It was
crowded under there but the Dykes didn't seem to mind.
The boxes are another story all together but that will
have to wait for a different permutation of my
thoughts. No need for POR15 and the 205/70 15's seemed
to be inflated. Can I get POR15 or tire inflation
guidance on Ebay? What is the M code for having to
bailing wire your heaterboxes opened? IS  there an M
code for the Dykes? M66 or M99? M8/8? Maybe they did
me wrong... 
If you want to read some *really* redundant posts
subscribe to the Vanagon list... Dual batteries, leaky
heads, digifant ECU hiccups, the ever present tire
size thing, wheel choices, wonderment of what that
silver socket is on the dashboard, dreams of engine
substitution and availability of sliding door handles.
