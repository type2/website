Subject: Re: [VB] 1960 15 window progress and front hub seals

Buy a front wheel bearing seal kit (#211-498-061) from Bus Boys in
Calif. and it comes with this rubber replacement seal.  (Also one thrust
washer and one lock washer.)

Anyone have any thoughts on whether we should stick with the old-style
metal/felt seals instead, or it is OK to change to the rubber?

&gt; When you say 'original' is there a 'modern' rubber replacement
&gt; seal available?  I bought new seals for my 23 project here in Oz but they were
&gt; 'original' metal/felt (211 405 641A).  I would actually be much happier with a
&gt; 'modern' press in rubber seal if they are available....are they?
&gt; And, if so, would anyone have a part no. for them?
