And the switch over from the 36 hp to the bastard 40 was on May 19 1959
(along with the switch from the split to tunnel case tranny).


&gt;&gt; For those of you that did not know there were a couple of Bus related
&gt;&gt;milestones in May. On the 25th of May 1947 Ben Pon sketches his I deas for
&gt;&gt;the Transporter based off the Beetle based truck that was used at
&gt;&gt;Wolfsburg.
&gt;&gt;And on May 13 1950 the Kombi Bus is introduced. It all started in May.
