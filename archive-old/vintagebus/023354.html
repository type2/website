Subject: '58 ghia front signals same as early bus??
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

This may be a tough question because it would require some knowledge of both
early bus and early ghia turn signals.  Therefore the one with the answer gets
twice the points for knowing. :)

	The bullet turn signals on my 58 ghia are missing the lens and the metal
cover that hold the lens on.  The unique thing about the 58 (and I assume 56
and 57) is that the portion of the turn signal that holds the bulb is actually
part of the fender.  On 59 ghia's and after the whole turn signal assemble
bolts to the fender.  At a recent swap meet I saw what I thought I needed.
Upon inquireing the lens and cover were for early bus.  My question is this.
Does the bullet style bus turn signal cover fit a ghia?  The lenses are the
same part number in my WCM catalog.  Will the metal cover fit the contour of
the ghia?  Does anyone have a set of covers?   bum,bum,bum, bumm bum,bum, bumm
(jeapordy tune)

Thanks
