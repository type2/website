Subject: [VB] Teflon buttons - good or bad?

I've got a brand new set of teflon wristpin buttons.  Compared to the stock
clips, are they better or worse?  Berg says not to use them but when I've
been researching old posts and other advertisements, it seems to be a hot
modification to do.  Any comments?
