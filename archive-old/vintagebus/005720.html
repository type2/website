&gt; One thing I forgot to post about on my previous step #4 post, is that I'm
&gt; having a hell of a time seeing when I weld.  I can have a nice seem all
set
&gt; up, and then when I'm done tacking it, I didn't do a bit of good because I
&gt; proceeded to tack weld out in the middle of nowheresville.  Is there a
&gt; product made like a crayon that glows when it receives UV light?  Or
should
&gt; I get one of those LCD shields?  Anyone else have this problem?  Thanks
for
&gt; any advice you can lend...
&gt;
howdy NQ.
might have some answers for you..
LCD sheilds are good but very expensive.. not really necessary but will help
if you can.
personally - over the years i've broke those many lenses i'd need to
remorgage to keep a stock..
what i do have is various shades (thickness) of lenses for my masks.
also different masks for different welding.
if i'm welding outside in the sun, i'll use the full head mask with a thin
lens... full head stops the sun shining round my head. and the thin lens
because if you use thicker its impossible to see.
- makes sence really- think about peeking through a window on a sunny day.
whats the first thing you do?- sheild the backlight from around your eyes

indoors welding under the bus... use a hand shield and a thick (darker)
lens.
also for different welding - tig, mig, arc, plate, sheet or tin, alluminium,
stainless, or mild, the torch shines different.. so its handy to have those
various lenses/masks there too.

Hope this helps

have fun, take care.

Glynn
