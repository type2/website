Subject: Late Vallejo CA show pics
Message-id: &lt;392f04d4.5296.0_at_jps_dot_net&gt;
X-User-Info: 208.214.170.43

Well it's only been a week since the show but since these things usually come
out a day or two after, it seems late to me.  This was a small show with a low
turnout, both in show cars and swappers.  The few highlights were the $900obo
23 window project, a nice 61 DC for sale and a guy that stuffed a corvair motor
in his bug.  I was figuring on snapping a ton of pics at Bug-o-rama but if we're
protesting...maybe I'll just take pics of that.  anyways, here's the link:
