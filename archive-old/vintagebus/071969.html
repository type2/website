Subject: Buses make great work trucks

IMHO

  I've actually looked forward to going to a nasty kitchen remodeling 
job this week because I'm working solo in my 65 EZ Camper.  I eat lunch 
in it, use it cut drywall, and raid my secret tool stash when I lose my 
nice needlenose pliers.

Quote of the week from 2 little kids walking by: &quot;Look at that!  Yeah, 
when police see those, they think the people inside went up in smoke&quot;  
I also had to laugh in the parking lot when I saw a guy tying  up the 
back doors of his econ%line to fit 10 footers while I revved by him 
trying to find 1st gear.

Have a great Friday and weekend!
