Subject: saphire III - info please

So I was at a local antiques / collectable shop today and there was this
'thing' for sale. It was a wooden cabinet with chrome legs - it was about 3
feet tall, the cabinet part was probably 1 1/2 feet tall and the legs were
about that high long as well.  It had a sapphire III radio in it and an
advertising sign on the front - it said VW Canada and had a map of Canada in
the background and the writing was in English and French. It had a speaker
that was mounted under the round sign.  The round sign had some spacer
dealies that provided a gap between the disc/sign and the wooden cabinet. On
the sign, along with writing and the map was a little portion that had
dealer information. It had a cord coming out of the bottom and it plugged
into 110 volts and played, it sounded very nice, lots more low end than I
expected.  I  had the antique shop guy plug it in and it sounded great.  Of
course the radio itself is mint, mint, mint.  I looked inside of the cabinet
and there appeared to be a few wires etc... and what I took to be some sort
of voltage drop, or transformer or something that permitted the sapphire III
to run on 110 volts.  If was very cool ..... but alas ..... I'm a po' boy.

So I figure I'll put together an assortment of collectable stuff I got
kickin' around and go and make a deal for this thing.  I have a few old oil
cans, etc.. I even have an Old Dutch Potato Chip can .... very cool ...
early 30's I'd guess ..  and .... I'm a picker Dottie .... so I should be
able to get this thing without cash :).  I just put 9 pieces in a local
auction ... wash stand, hand dovetailed wooden immigrant chest .... very
cool original paint jam cupboard ..... :).  That should buy me new tires and
get my BN 2 bench tested and ready for installation - it was about 25 C
yesterday ... very tough driving a bus when it's that cold ... got to scrap
ice of both sides of the windows .....

Anyway, so what's the story on the Sapphire III.  This is AM only - what
years where they VW's radio of choice?  Are they 12 volt or are they 6 volt?

I'm not 100% sure that I want this thing .... I could use that radio and it
is mint .... but that would mean taking this radio display cabinet apart
.... I'm not sure I would want to/ or be able to/ do that. I try not to
alter things too much.

Oh yeah, they want $200 Canadian for it, I'd guess that's about $120 US. If
I buy this thing I think it may end up in my living room - maybe in the
corner beside my 1942 Anson propeller - or maybe the propeller will have to
finance my new radio.  Anyone want to buy a 1942 Anson propeller - jk.  BTW
Richard Burton the actor was lost while flying an Anson over central
Manitoba while he was training to be a pilot during WWII.
