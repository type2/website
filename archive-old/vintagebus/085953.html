Subject: Re: [VB] Cooling Flap return spring for doghouse shroud

In a message dated 2/19/2006 5:07:55 P.M. Pacific Standard Time,  
badaugherty_at_msn_dot_com writes: &gt;&gt; Has anyone used a carb spring or  another generic spring 
on their cooling flaps?  I am concerned about using  another spring that may 
have too much tension.   &lt;&lt;



Hi Bart,
You can get them for less than $3.00 _at_
_http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem71.html_ 
(http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem71.html) 
You really do not want to use a tighter spring like the carb cable return  
spring.  That could interfere with the flaps from closing all the  way.  It just 
needs to be strong enough so that if the linkage fails the  flaps will open.
