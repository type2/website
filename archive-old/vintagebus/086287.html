Subject: My very own bus model

My bus is posing with a ladder on The Samba classifieds. It's the one  
sporting a mottled-gray primer finish. I think it did that just to  
get back at me for not giving it a paint job. My air-cooled Vanagon  
also took part in the photo shoot, but was a bit miffed at all the  
attention the bus is getting as a result of the front cover photo.

Please note: I am not associated with the seller other than being a  
happy customer.
