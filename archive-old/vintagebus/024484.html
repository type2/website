Subject: parts

I earlier made a post concerning the Bus Depot. The responses have been 
overwhelmingly favorable concerning this business. I have also recieved 
good recomendations for The Old Volks Home, but will probably order my 
seals through the Bus Depot because they are within &quot;choking distance&quot; to 
me!!

Sorry to have stirred up the pot so much, but I felt it was necessary. I 
will probably order just a few seals at first to test the water.
