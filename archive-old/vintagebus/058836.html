Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Shades - Need replacement fabric - BYOB caravan from
	 Central CA

  This might help the Costco cover owners. Costco warrents the cover for 3
years. You can take the whole thing back and they will replace it free (ya
right, like I want to take it down) or you can go to there web site and the
manufacturers phone number is there. All I did was call them up, fax them a
copy of my reciept and had a new top and sides in 3 days!! Great customer
service

The fabric on the Costco 10x20' shelter has been weakened by UV and torn by
storms. Does anyone have the site or phone number for the manufacturer
handy? Should be on the assembly instructions.  Bus content... I'll be
living in my bus if I don't get it fixed soon!

Tentatively, Karl and I will be leaving Fresno at noon on Friday. We'll be
on 152 mostly.  Another group will be leaving after 5 p.m. We'll be moving
fast, they'll be slower if anyone wants to join in.
