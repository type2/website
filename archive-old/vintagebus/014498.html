&lt;&lt; I'm in the process of installing carpet pad in my 66.  I'm using 1/2&quot; pad
and
 double face tape (both freebies from work).  So far, I haven't had any
 problems with the installation.  I have used 3 layers on the roof as a trial
 to see if it would hold (the double face).  It seems to do the trick.  I got
 the idea after using a double layer on the floor and engine areas and really
 noticed a reduction in noise. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
This material by itself will definitely create rust in your bus.  Unless you
are planning to only drive it to shows and keep it in a heated garage all
other times or giving up breathing which is how most moisture gets into the VW
interior.  Take it out now!  We got our panel with indoor/outdoor carpet glued
to the inside of the ceiling.  This the stuff that looks like felt and has a
thin foam rubber base.  Total thickness about 1/8&quot;.  The next thing we knew
this material was falling down and releasing a rain of rust on us.  Have been
fighting the rust for five years and slowly winning.  Once the rust gets
between sheet metal, into cracks and corners it is a pain to completely clean
out!  Plus the added joy of trying to work overhead, getting it into your eyes
and coated throughly.  Eric &amp; Barb
