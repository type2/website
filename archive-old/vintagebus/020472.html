&gt;One of a kind!This bus is a 65 split window sundial camper with original 
interior and tags. The motor is a 65 V-6 buick engine and was placed in by 
sundial as a original engine, only 1500 were made so its a rare one. the bus is 
green with red interior. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Huh????

Call me a sceptic, but;

a) WAS there a Buick V6 in 1965? I thought it was either straight 6s, flat 6s, 
or V8s back then?

b) It seems RATHER unlikely that a camper conversion company would have been 
doing a hot rod engine swap as original equipment then, or now. While I'm 
certainly no expert, I didn't think that even VW speed nuts were doing major 
engine conversions on Type2s in the 60's.

c) Seems likely that the &quot;seller&quot; is either VERY gullible, or thinks that 
everyone else is. ;^)

That's my sceptical 2c, anyway (it's not like we see dodgy claims on Ebay etc, 
though, is it? ;^)
