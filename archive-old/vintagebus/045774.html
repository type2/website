&gt;&gt; 1. I'm getting a short grinding sound upon acceleration 
&gt;&gt; after shifting from 2nd to 3rd, and to a lesser degree, 
&gt;&gt; 3rd to 4th, just after the shift though, then it's gone....  

Well now....  You're getting a grinding noise just after upshift?  
No grinding on downshifts?  Any noise downshifting from 4th to 3rd?  
The trans stays in gear ok?  Seems like this noise is centered on 
3rd and 4th gears.  Those gears share a engagement slider or op 
sleeve on the mainshaft and the problem may lie there.  Did your 
rebuilder replace that slider with either a new unit or a remachined 
one?  New syncros on all the gears?  Might be some questions 
you should ask.   I always use new syncros- yes, they are Brazilian 
but I also check the fit to the gear cone.  And I have never had any 
problems with them.  If I had you can bet that I would insist on
using either another brand or the more expensive German ones.  
As for the slider I use a remachined '002' version of it, even on the 
early units.  Again, never a problem there.
 
&gt;&gt; 2.  The gear ratio on this rebuild seems WAY lower (especially 4th)
&gt;&gt; 	than the previous trans, which I assumed to be original.  I'm told 
&gt;&gt; that the rebuild is from a '67 Bus but had a taller 4th gear installed, 
&gt;&gt; but it seems the opposite is true (this thing SCREAMS at 50mph)  
&gt;&gt; My question is: Could a mistake in the clutch / redux. boxes etc. 
&gt;&gt; replacement / assembly process cause this, provided the gear ratios 
&gt;&gt; are as claimed?  I spoke with the rebuilder and he was puzzled but 
&gt;&gt; offered to exchange the trans for another......... 

OK- there are *always* exceptions but your Bus should have come from 
Uncle VW with a 4.125 ring and pinion with a 1st-4th ratio set of:
3.80/2.06/1.21/.82 and a redux box ratio of 1.26.   While I do not have
a calculator handy you can do this at home (with parental guidance)
Multiply your MPH by the following:  4.125 X .82 X 1.26 X 336 and 
divide all that by your tire height. (25&quot; +/- for stock sized tires)  This
will 
give you the engine RPMs for that speed with your gear train.  What *may* 
have happened in your rebuild is that for some unknown reason you got 
a 4.375 ring and pinion set and the stock Beetle 4th gear of .89.  If you 
plug those numbers in where the 4.125 and .82 are in the above formula 
then you can see that for traveling the same MPH your engine's RPM 
takes a large leap upward.  Pretty much this is just about the only thing
that can cause vehicle speed vs. engine rpms to change.  Tire height will
also play a factor but I assume that you still have the same ones on the
Bus.

Don't we all and don't we all!
