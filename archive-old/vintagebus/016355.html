Depends somewhat on what bumpers you've got, etc.  I usually call it
fourteen feet, and then allow an extra three or four for pulling it in,
walking around, and closing the garage/shed door from the inside.
If you ever think you might want to open the rear hatch inside the
shed with the door closed, you'll need that extra four feet....
