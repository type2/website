&lt;&lt; &gt;It does sound sketchy - you don't have &quot;gaskets&quot;! 
 
 Well, he showed me what looked like a thin ring around the inside of the big
 circle the valves are in, (highly technical terminology ;-) which was broken.
 
 It's a 1500cc, so single port.  Up here in Canada the piston &amp; cylinder set
 is closer to $200 - it's going to cost me $100 min to rebuild the heads, 
prob'ly
 another $200-$250 to replace the cracked one, depending whether I go with a
 new one or a rebuilt.  Considering the whole motor cost me $500, turn-key 
with
 everything, this is getting kind of pricey.  But I'll do what I have to.  
Guess
 I'll just wait until I hear back from the machine shop Monday.
  &gt;&gt;
that &quot;gasket&quot; sounds like a shim- which makes sens eif the heads were 
previously rebuildt and flycut.

DO NOT pay mucho bucks for head cores.  Heck I am sure someone would give you 
SP head cores.  I would.  

is yours  really a 1500?    If so, you shoudl replace all the ps and cs if 
you were wanting to do one, as it is much harder to find 1500 that 1600 
stuff.   Just cause you have an H case motor (I guess) does'tn mean it isn't 
a 1600, the ps and cs fit the same.  Or do you have a big bore 40hp?    Are 
you in Vancouver or on the island- I have a friend on Vancouver Island whos a 
real nice guy would help out.

sorry for the three posts- I should have checked my mail and just made one 
reply.
