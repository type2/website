Subject: Re: [VB] cargo area divider

I made my own cab divider a few years ago using cardboard to mock up a
pattern for it, and cutting it out of thin wood. Then with it in place, I
sat in my comfy driving position and traced the edge of the rear view mirror
on the divider. Then installed a simple plexi into that hole and was done. I
think Beto from this list ended up with it a couple years ago. Or did I end
up tossing it? I can't remember anymore.

If I were to do another one, I would make it out of clear plexi, so you
couldn't see it from the outside. Keep the clean lines of the Delux flowing.
;-) I would only use it to help keep heat up front in the bus during those
20 degree mornings. hehe.
