Is there _really_ that much difference between the two?  Short of the
cosmetics, I really don't think so.  It's a bit like comparing Model Ts
to Model As.  To those in the know they are quite different, each lovable
in its own way.  To the rest of us, they are all &quot;old Fords&quot;.  I'd say
that if there is a niche to be filled and you're willing to carry the
traffic there shouldn't be any problem.  Put a warning at the top of the
Bay page to inform the splittie purists that they are entering a Bay zone
and to put their aluminum foil hats on.

Of course, then you have to decide whether to carry the Kewl early bays
with upright engines versus those pedestrian late bays with flat engines.
The air intakes on the early bays have those sexy curves while the late
bays have those ugly squared off intakes.  I won't even go into the
blasphemy of integrated back-up lights and leaving the turn signals where
God intended, below the headlights...

&gt; I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of bay-window
&gt; pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I allow 
&gt; the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail from 
&gt; my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I don't
&gt; support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for bay-windows - 
&gt; does one exist?
