Has anyone worked up *good* directions for people who are NOT from
Silly Valley?  Every single year I've gone to KP I've gotten lost!

How about good directions to Red Barn?

&gt; Altho, from I5 out of the North you probably want to go West on Hwy 580, 
&gt; then South on Hwy 680, then South again on Hwy 101.  The Tully Road exit 
&gt; will be what you want to take west (right) to Senter Road.  Left on Senter 
&gt; and Kelley Park will be at the corner of Phelan Ave on the left.  Now, I'm 
&gt; trying to remember exactly, but 680 to 101 South might actually drop you 
&gt; one exit too far south.  Just loop back onto 101 North if need be and exit
