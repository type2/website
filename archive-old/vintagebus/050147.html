Subject: Re: [VB] Junk vehicle rampage -RANT-

Good News: The next morning, I call the inspector named on my guvmint
&gt;warning. &quot;Look,&quot; he says, &quot;if somebody complains, we gotta do an inspection,
&gt;and if there's something there to write up, we gotta write it up. Sorry.&quot;
&gt;But he is surprisingly sympathetic to my problem. I ask him what I can do
&gt;short of selling off my VWs that will make him happy, and he says that if a
&gt;vehicle is tagged and *appears* to be operable in the inspector's opinion,
&gt;wink-wink-nudge-nudge, then it's not a junk vehicle.

There's something about a smilling, laughing, &quot;I'm your buddy&quot; oppressor
that I find even more disturbing than the typical jack booted thug.  If the
guy was REALLY your buddy, he'd quit his parasite job and get a real job in
the private sector, rather than living off of money you've had to pay to
stay out of jail (or the morgue).




&gt;Conclusions: This could've turned out much worse than it did. In my
&gt;area --Atlanta 'burbs--my new inspector buddy tells me, the zoning rules
&gt;prohibit practically any automotive work at a residence, up to &amp; including
&gt;oil changes.

Sonds like a free counrty all right.  Ever notice how rarely you hear the
expression &quot;It's a free county!&quot; anymore?  On some level, most people know
that their freedom has been lost.



 The philosophy seems to be to outlaw everything, so when they
&gt;do decide to throw the book at a guy, it's a hefty book.

Or outlaw everything, and then they can act like they're doing you a favor
when you are permitted to do anything.  That was once called
'totalitarianism', but I guess that word is out of fashion now.



 I do agree with
&gt;Thom that we don't have the right to an eyesore that offends our community,
&gt;but if a neighbor has to go out of his way, even trespass, to find my
&gt;eyesore, then it should be _his_  problem.

This is the scariest thing of all.  When others get to decide what offends
them, and then use the force of government to stop you from carrying on
your 'offensive' behavior, then you are no longer free.  Just like the
speech codes on college campuses.

No one has the right not to be offended, or not to look at anything ugly.
A concept of rights like those only leads to zero freedom for anyone.




 But that's not the way the laws
&gt;are written. What offends me most about this whole episode is that my
&gt;[assumptions follow] yuppie, new to _my_ neighborhood [I've been here since
&gt;'65] neighbor couldn't take the time to introduce himself and make his
&gt;problems known to me. If he'd done so, I would've happily done all the
&gt;things I ended up doing anyway, and we could've left the guvmint out of it.
&gt;Maybe we'd even be friends by now. Stranger things have happened.

I guess you've learned something about your neighbor's character.
