    Body fillers have come a long way, originally made of talc and clay, it tended to suck water.  With todays new plasic fillers, the talc and clay content is very small.  Also a great improvement with todays fillers is adhesion.  The stuff sticks great!  The rule of thumb or at least this is what they taught me in college, is body filler should never be no thicker than an 1/8 of an inch.  Well, I finished college, even got to wear one of the funky little square hats.  I soon stuck out into the real world.  The shop I worked at rule of thumb was no thicker than 1/4 inch and make it as thin as possible when possible.  They used Rage, it doesn't bleed thur and is pretty cheap.  The bleeding was the main reason thou.  I then went to work at a major chain.  The horrors I saw.  I saw complete qrt. panels being built with body filler.  We're talking 1 to 2 inchs and up!!  All I could say is....Ought Oh!!!  I walked out the doors two hours later.  There are some things I will not do to a car, even Chevies.  But this did show just how strong body filler is.
    As for my personal body work, I stick to the 1/8 inch or metal finish, but then again I have a stud gun.
   Peace, Love, and Mud is your friend (if used right)
