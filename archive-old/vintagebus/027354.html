&gt; I believe that the pitman arm in NOT supposed to be removed and reindexed.
&gt; Seems to me that the splines are sometimes made (on some cars) with one
&gt; different from the rest, so that there is only ONE way to put the pitman
&gt; arm on.

You're joking ....right?  The Bentley says nothing re: not ever removing the
arm.  In fact Section V10 page 3 has a picture of someone pulling the arm off
with the accompanying removal procedure text.

The &quot;overrun&quot; is fine.  I don't need to fix  it  by adjusting the drag link
(per section V10 page 4 in the Bentley) or the tie rods.  I just need to find
a quick way of centering the box with the arm off.
