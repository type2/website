&gt;&gt;3,000 miles on my new Ronnie OldVolks installed 1776 with gearing upgrade 
&gt;&gt;in


I like it! I have a 1776 in my bus, just put in dual carbs, and wow.
I had some issues with bad floats and a vacuum leak, but that was easy to 
fix and now the bus just goes. I drive it conservatily and it is a friend. I 
push it, and away ir goes. I cant see going back...........
