i just got done putting new cv boots on and changing the tranny and transfer
case oils in my 66 deluxe, if anyone has been putting off changing thier cv
boots or tranny oil, dont! IT is so easy, you just have to love the old
buses.
But the wierd thing was that i didnt tighten down the lug nuts because i had
just painted the rim and i went for a test drive, when i got up to about 40
the speedometer started making a wild buzzing sound  and flickin all over
the place, so i stopped to fix it, and nothing was wrong with it,  so i took
off again and at 40 the speedo went crazy,   and i noticed the clugging of
the rear wheel, ooops, so i tightened up the lugs and got back on the road
and the speedo was fine,  anybody ever heard of that?
