Subject:  [VB] Alternator light

My DC has been converted to 12V by the PO and has the big Alternator with
the regulator built in.  I'm trying to trouble shhot why my Alt light in the
dash won't come on.  I don't think I can follow the same procedures as for a
generator with seperate regulator (i.e. grounding the wire to see if the
light comes on...if so, bad regulator or its ground).  All I've got is the
positive lead to the battery and the wire to the dash light.  How can I
trouble shhot this to see if its the wiring, alternator(which is new), or
something else? 

Thanks,

Charles
