E&amp;B,
The later (74, 75??) telescopic poles were made that way so that they 
could be stored under the rear seat.  In that westy set up, they could 
not be stored above a cabinet such as in the SO-67 westy (early bay) set up.

VB content: my bus is still up on jackstands awaiting its new trans. 
I'll be installing new mounts on the old (but perfectly good) one so 
that its ready to go if needed.

Isaiah.

&gt; Somewhere after 68 both U shaped poles where telescopic.  Possibly to allow 
&gt; installation in the pre-1968 Westies?   Eric&amp;Barb
