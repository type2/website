&lt;&lt; Hello, All...
    While I was working on my bus yesterday, I noticed that
 the lower hinges(where it mounts to the door) on the drivers
 and passengers doors are loose and have a few small cracks
 around them. Do I just weld them up or is there some kind
 of reinforcement plate that I could make and install?
 Thanks! &gt;&gt;

You must be talking about the front doors on a bus with the door stayer 
opener thing.  just you weld them up.  plus lube that door stayer opener 
mechanism.   This problem doesn't tend to happen to pull handle buses.
