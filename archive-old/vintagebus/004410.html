Well, I now have a 6 week &quot;Vacation&quot; on my hands so, I'm going to start
betting the exterior of the 66 ready to go to the body shop for a bit of
work and paint.  Problem is, I'm a carpenter, not a paint and body man.
What I have is about 7 layers of paint that were hand painted to give it a
logo and name of the company I bought it from.  What would be the best way
to remove it?
Also, what should I use in the interm  to protect the metal before I can get
it to the shop?  As I said, this will be my first attempt at doing anything
of this nature and, any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

Ps, my daughter is home from college with her scanner so, I'll try to put
together a web page (if it was wood I know I could do it), and get some
progress pictures.
