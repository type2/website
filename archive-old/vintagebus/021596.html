I agree Skid but thats a 2 way street, i orded some sheetmetal just over a 
week ago from a supplier that i normally order from, parts came in 3 days 
,,hmmm strange ,,opened up the boxes i got a shock ,,ordered inner rockers 
,,wound up with something called a universal side member from the veng 
manufacturer,,looked like a friggin top hat,,nothing like that on the splits 
i'm working on,ok so a minor goof ,,opened the box with my cargo  floor parts 
,,2 outter sections 1 drivers 1 passengers well dang i got 2 drivers from 
different manufacturers ,,grrrrr this is not good ,,looked at the cargo floor 
halfs ,,ok 1 is rite the same as i have been using cool ,moved it off the 
pile and found the nastiest poorly made peice of crap floor half i have ever 
laid my eyes on,,totaly different patterns on the floor and the seat holds 
downs are completly different ,,this crap is disgusting ,,on the phone i go 
banter back and forth with the tech guy for 2 days ,,oh yea there different 
,,no *hit dick tracey ,well we should have the rite one in a month yea rite 
,,i'm shipping the whole friggin thing back to make it short ,,the point is 
,,if your gonna sell it you need to know what the heck your selling and what 
it looks like and also that the parts the are in more than one half at least  
matched ,,oh btw the one manaufacturer's floors i wouldn't use for patch 
panels is was junk, not naming the supplier for the simple fact i bitched 
enough their getting back to the good stuff ,,or so they say ,if they don't 
i'll sure spill the beans,,,,sorry for the ranting ,,venting a bit ,,Later
