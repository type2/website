&gt; ok, so i got the crank all done up today, stoopit shop breakage and all.
&gt; so i'm testing camshaft gears, and i've hit a snag .    again :)

&gt; i have a slew of cams, and i'll be damned if all of em don't seem 
&gt; wrong; ronnie suggested i set the endplay and THEN measure cam lash, 
&gt; but i don't know that i'm getting better results.

Don't know the history here, but I would suspect the case.
