Seeing the outpouring of grief by everyone, makes you see how special this
group of people really is.  I've always said that bus people are the best
people.  I'm even more sure now.  

I only knew Josh for a little over two years, but I had the same feeling
as everyone else reguarding his character.  He was a very special
individual, always willing the help out any way he could.  I have some
major regrets that I didn't take him up on his numerous offers to meet me
at Little Sahara.  

His presence in the VW bus community will be greatly missed.  But his
impact will live on.  

God Bless You Josh.
