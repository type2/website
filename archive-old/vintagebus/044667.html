Hi Volks,
Both of these methods can easily damage the stub axle, especially the latter 
method is really good at destroying the threads.

&lt;&lt;, the wheel back on and tighten up the lug nuts and lower the bus back down 
to the ground.  &gt;&gt;
Tried this on a bus we helped a friend rescue just on the Eastern side of the 
Cascdes near the Columbia river.  He drove it over 600miles without 
loosening!  Had to go down to the local tool rental place and for $7.00 for 
the day got a puller that grabbed the inside of the rib on the outside of the 
drum.  Still fought us all the way off!
Beware the type of pullers that use the lugbolts.  These tend to pull out the 
threads in the drum especially the pullers that only use three of the five 
bolts.
