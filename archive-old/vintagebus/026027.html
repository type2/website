That feeling when you go to shift a gear and POW there goes your clutch
cable. I thought about pulling over but decided to drive on home with
only two lights left and pray for green. Of course the first light
turned red when I'm within 15 feet, so I have to stop. I don't get to
upset remembering St. Muir saying if you syncro right you can shift with
no clutch, light turns green, I try to put her in first, GRRRRRRRIIIND
she pops in, and I give her enough gas to get going just before the
horns behind me start blowing. Second and third weren't as bad but it
still hurt hearing my baby grind into gears. I made the second light by
running a solid yellow and then 2 blocks home. I had to push her into
the garage as I couldn't bare to hear the gears grind again. So now I
get to change a clutch cable, can't wait.

I do have a question or two, HOW DO YOU DRIVE WITHOUT A CLUTCH. I
haven't had a chance to look back at what Muir said, but figured you
guys would know more any how. How can you tell when the engine and trans
are in sync with each other. I tried to go by sound and it worked ok.
Should you start off in second as oppose to first?

Also should I just go ahead and drop the engine to replace the cable? I
figure it's just as easy to do that as oppose to trying to snake in with
the engine in the way. I don't know for a fact it's the cable but that's
what it sounded like, not a throw out arm or something.

I just hope none of you ever have to experience that feeling,
fortunately I was within miles of my home. However hopefully we can get
some good advice from those who have had to do this type shifting
before.

I think my baby was just missing some attention and she want's some TLC.
I can't believe how when this happened I felt even more like she was
part of me, she was hurting and so was I. These things do become a part
of you and your life.
As always thanks for any help.
Meredith
