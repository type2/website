I have to agree with Dan the man at ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com.

I had to pry the POS psuedo-Euro 57 single cab away
from Paula at the end of the restoration to her 67
SO42  Westfalia camper. At that time I was
&quot;down-sized&quot; from my job and we needed cash flow. We
had just driven slightly under 2000 miles from Phoenix
to the Kelly Park show and back, camped in the fresh
new bus and took 2nd place losing only to Bob
Sowersby's non-daily driver 23 window.
You name it and the single cab needed it. That didnt
matter. We drove that thing for over six years in
rattle can primer, no hub caps, no heat, leaking
windows, duct tape held the wing vent glass in place.
That didnt matter to Paula as she literally cried when
our buddy VWFOOL_at_aol_dot_com drove away in it. The entire
time that we owned the truck, commercial vehicles,
especially panels and single cabs were as far &quot;out&quot; of
favor as you could get. I swear that it was the very
next day that someone declared panels and 'cabs to be
the &quot;****&quot; for the next 18 months. &lt;DOH!&gt;
We enjoy the overly touted Westfalia but it actually
gets to be kind of a pain in the butt having to ginger
foot around it.
Rule of thumb: Enjoy what you have and be careful of
what you wish for as you just might get it...
