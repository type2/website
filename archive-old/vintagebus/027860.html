&gt;I use the Pertronix Ignitor (sp?) + Universal Corporation's Tiger 581
capacitive discharge ignition (CDI). &lt;
Out of curiosity why both?  I thought one or the other would do the same
thing alone?

&gt;the Tiger 581 is made in Colorado, not Taiwan, and from what I understand
they are happy to replace defective units.&lt;
Yes, the Tiger 581 is made in Colorado, which is great because I love to buy
American when at all possible.  I was mixing my complaining and throwing
Taiwan into the mix,  I have been spending the last few weekends replacing
all the &quot;Made In Taiwan&quot; stuff with stock components because of better
fit...  Long story.  I have only heard good things about Universal Corp so
hopefully they will stand behind the product.

When the Tiger 581 was running it was excellent!  I ran it for about two
years and was very pleased with the results.  The plugs were always clean
and when I took the heads off they were clean too!  Usually the heads are
gummed up with carbon.  Also Andrew is on the money about easy start ups,
half a crank and she was running, I have never seen any automobile ever that
started that quickly.  I do recommend this upgrade, but I am not buying it
twice.  I hope Universal Corp stands by the product.  I cannot understand
what would go wrong either?  

Thanks,
