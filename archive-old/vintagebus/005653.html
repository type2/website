Dear Folks,

Whew! At last the Great Bus Tour web site is up and running. It's at
http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff . Many, many thanks to Ken Hooper and the list
gods without whom the page would not be possible! Thanks also to Hall
Stuart-Lovell and Andy in Miami who have helped with the photos!

This page is nowhere near finished and probably won't be until the last bus
has passed the baton and the last song is sung. Also, the proposed route on
the &quot;Map Page&quot; is just that, proposed. The whole idea behind the Tour was to
get as many people who wanted to be involved,   so input regarding the route
is always welcomed! If you even think you want to drive, sign up! If there
is any way at all possible, you will get to drive.

For those who have already driven, we need to know who you are and where
you've been! So we'd really appreciate it if you would help us update trip
reports and itineraries even if you've posted these to the list before, it
would be a big help if you would send your reports (they don't have to be
perfect, just informative) and any photos to me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net.

Thanks to you all for your interest and continued support of the Tour! It
belongs to us all and will continue in the spirit of friendship and fun!

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
