Not only that, but are the beetles, buses, things, etc not on your very own 
property that you are paying to own or rent? If you own the place, then you 
pay substantial tax on it as well. When we owned a house and 7 VW's and the 
city came to us pulling this BS I was pissed, and I went to court(to no 
avail). It's ridiculous in this land of the free that we can't have as many 
cars as we want. Don't the lawmakers of this land need to get busy cracking 
down on real crime?
