Subject: Re: [VB] RMMW

i heard that vwoa hit rmmw for $20,000+ of inventory and bs. 
i don't want to bad mouth rmmw, but they really are just a middle man for a
vast majority of their parts line, at least for vw, with an incredible
retail mark-up. meaning they are not the sole importer or distributor.
shops can get the same exact parts for less through wholseale sources, like
h+h, worldpac, imc, pacific parts, tmi, etc... and i'm sure that shops
which do order from such suppliers pass the lower price on to customers.
when i worked at a vw shop with a very large inventory, i don't remember
seeing much that was a &quot;rmmw part only&quot;. i even saw things that were from
rmmw that had other wholesaler parts tags still on them.
maybe it's time for people to support local shops rather than rmmw type
places.

oh yeah, all this talk about oil screens makes me want to say this:
although some are down on vwoa, they still carry original german oil
screens, at least for later model cases. they are not cheap, about $10 or
so, but they fit, the centers don't get stuck on the pickup tube, and they
have the nice tight screen. ask your dealer to order on for you.

&gt; BTW, Bus Depot gets a lot of their stuff from RMMW, and has it
&gt; drop-shipped from RMMW, so....
&gt; 
&gt; I think the VWOA debacle is what really nailed 'em.

&gt; &gt; With their prices, how could they go bankrupt?!?!?! Must have been all
those color glossy catalogs they print, I know I have received about 15 of
these in one year!  I'd be willing to give them all back if it would help
them out.  Seriously though, I'd hate to see them go under (even though I
started to buy all me parts from Bus Depot ;^)
