Subject: Re: [VB] How to date a front beam?

&gt;I noticed my front beam on the '61 Double Cab is missing the steering

&gt;still has the mount on it to accomodate the proper year beam.
&gt;
&gt;So...what beam do I have?

Sorry, can't help you.   I'm sure one of the gurus will speak up.

Until I read the question, the subject line had me thinking you were 
starting some sort of new TV Dating Show to keep up with the current genre 
of let it all hang out shows.   Might start a new trend,  &quot;Beam 
Dating&quot;,  news at 11
