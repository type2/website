Subject: RE: single cab side loader

Is this anything like the truck on Thom's site used for german road
crews? I remember that one had a big toolbox with a padded cover over
it.  I think the caption said these came from the factory like that.
Was the door hinged on the side or the bottom?
    Also, with all this talk of freeway fliers, can anyone recommend a
good place to have one made &quot;right&quot; in the ventura, san fernando valley
area?
Thanks,
Jon
