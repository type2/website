Subject: pop-top hinges

So ... I'm in the process of getting a poptop ready to put on my 60.  I know
it's wrong but ... my roof had big problems so putting on the poptop is not
like cutting a hole in a nice roof - I'm trying to clean up the hinges and
metal pieces on a poptop.  The hinges are kinda oxidized and look a bit
crappy.  I can replace the nuts and bolts .. but there appears to be rust on
some parts besides the nuts and bolts.

What are these pieces of metal made of?

What is the best way to make these look nice?
