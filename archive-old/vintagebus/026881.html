Howdy All,
Just a note to remind you that the &quot;VW Buses'n Boats Bash&quot; just north of Cincinnati, Ohio in May is quickly approaching.  I have gotten confirmations from bus-heads from as far as Arkansas and Maryland.  The band is looking forward to it as am I.  It is looking to become quite a fun VW Camp-out weekend.  Don't miss the fun and VW comeraderie as well as good music and great canoeing, hiking, and biking.  Remember, the web site address is  www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats (it is also listed on the VW Planet and Typ2_dot_com events pages)
where you will find all of the information.  If you need an answer that the web site did not answer, or if you still need to make your reservation, please email me.  Gotta go now, I just bought a '66 camper a couple of days ago and I want it to be ready for the May Bash!!! (if you are getting this message twice, I apologize, I know I've got some of you all listed twice in my address book, sorry!)




Peace, John Baker
