Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals - Safari

Okay, my bad, seems strange though as I can peel the &quot;for subfloors&quot;
stuff right off plywood (lotsa tooth) and I can't get the &quot;for
foamboard&quot; stuff to stick to anything. I did preface the earlier post
with I haven't tried this before...

I don't think Liquid Nails would be a wise choice for this
application.
It would probably tear the rubber and be a pain in the a$$ to get off
the frames once you wanted to open the safaris.  A better choice would
be to get a roll of vinyl mastic and massage it around the
frame/rubber
interface when the window is closed.  Place the seam at the top.

I don't have safari windows so I haven't tried this, but the &quot;a
caulk/putty/magic stuff that doesn't stick *too* hard&quot; you seek sounds
like one of the many formulations of &quot;Liquid Nails&quot;, a caulk-like
adhesive readily found at Home Despots and such stores.
