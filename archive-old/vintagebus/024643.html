&gt; We are planning a trip to Newfoundland this summer, probably a month or so,
&gt; in our '65 Westy. I am kind of thinking of pulling the original engine and
&gt; putting in a fresh, brand new one. What is the difference between the new
&gt; engines places like Scat sells, and the Bettlemex engine? The price is
&gt; about the same it seems. Are they both new Mexican built?  thanks, Jim
&gt; 
&gt; 

It is my understanding that yes, they are all the same mexican buit new
engines. 
I don't have any experience with the long blocks, but the brand new
Mexican cases sure are nice.

You might try around to see if there are any cheaper sources for this
same engine through a local source.

I know that Halsey Automotive in Portland Oregon has them for cheaper
than Scat. Not sure about Beetlemex.
