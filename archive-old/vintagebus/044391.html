Subject: Re: [VB] The safari/leakage situation

&gt;I think the first order of business is that the frames MUST fit 
&gt;first.  I looked at a very nice deluxe parked &gt;next to me at KP and 
&gt;noticed that there was at least an 1/8th to 1/4 inch gap at the 
&gt;upper right corner &gt;of one of the REPO safari windows.  I don't care 
&gt;what type of rubber you stuff in there...its gonna leak!

I've got a set of the old Bus Boys windows...which I've heard before 
are the worst. The rubber I used works fine with them. The reason why 
is that it's a big fat hollow round thing. I mean BIG! The window 
closes the frame/glass crushes the hollow round. Seals VERY good. 
Look at modern mini vans and what they use for seals. The same 
concept....same type of rubber. Your right that the solid stuff you 
get with the repros will never work with the repro window frames. 
Even if it fit the window hole (which it doesn't) it doesn't give 
enough &quot;crush&quot; to allow for a nice big sealing surface. The main 
thing is that they are just going at the rubber all wrong. The other 
nice thing about the rubber I used is that the part that goes onto 
the window seal has some thin flex metal or something in it. You just 
open it a little, slide it on the lip, and the crush it with some 
plyers or something. Very nice looking and works SOOOOO good.
