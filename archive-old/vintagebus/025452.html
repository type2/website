I'd try the proven 3.88 R&amp;P, 1.26 reductions, and the .82 4th. Don't let
the tranny builder sneak in a .89 bug 4th though or you'll lose the
benefits of the 3.88 R&amp;P. It almost happened to me, the assembler said
it would have been easier to put in the .89 fourth. 

Here's what the numbers look like:

Final Drive : 5.14 ( 3.88 R&amp;P + 1.26 reduction )
Gear Ratio  : 0.89 Bug 4th
Tire Height : 25&quot;

With the first option, the gearing would be worse than a stock '64-'67
Bus assembly. Gene Berg has an interesting article on gearing which
should be required reading for all air cooled VW owners. 5 speeds are
beneficial to people that need close ratio gearing up to the stock
fourth, then they usually use a .89 for 5th gear so they can get home
&gt;from the race track without blowing up their engines.
