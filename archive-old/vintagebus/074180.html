Subject: RE: [VB] oil temps

Jerry at Northwest Connecting Rod says that the new aluminum blocks run 15-30
degrees hotter than the faster cooling OEM magnesium alloy. He has been
drilling all that he gets in, including mine, for full flow and external
coolers. I would run an inline thermostat too to regulate the temp. It's just
as hard on your engine if the oil is too cool.

Hi group,
I'm a newby to this list and to aircooled engines....except for the
scooters. Glad I never put a oil temp gauge on the Harleys!!!
I have 67 bus with 1776cc alum. blk,044heads, doghouse cooler, mild cam
with stock exhaust, and stock transaxle with redux gears. Have run
dinosaur and synthetic oil. Temp sensor in pressure relief valve. Temps
run 240-260 and scares me to the point of pulling over for a cool down.
I will soon add an oil cooler/wfan.
Are these temps TOO high? Should I be SKEERED!!
What temps are your buses running?
Truth
Thanks,
LJ
