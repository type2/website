Hello bus people!

Thankyou for all the useful tire info. How about putting that tire
size comparison chart Kabayo posted on the library page? There is 14&quot;
info listed, but I didn't see anything relating to the 15&quot; rims there.

So how do I tell if my bus is a 3/4 or a 1 ton chassis? I have bus
1145666. VW built a panel,  Sundial (I believe)made it a camper. It
was built, sold and first registered in 1963, but uses 1964 brake
parts. The RGB spindles take 46mm nuts. The rims are 15&quot;, and I think
they are probably original, since most everything else is.  What is
the difference in construction between the two chassis?

Thanks,
Joel
'63 Sundial (just got an engine today!)
