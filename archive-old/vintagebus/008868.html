Subject: [VB] Bus burning at EB


&gt; I bought a splitty again last week. Found it in a barn as had not been on
&gt; the road in a while. Has a little rust on the surface. I put fresh gas and
&gt; battery in and started right up (there is a little knock)!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I only paid $50.00 for it so I plan to drive it to Every Bus and
&gt; demonstrate what an engine fire can do! I will drive it to that field away
&gt; from everyone at the end of the campout area and disconnect a fuel line
and
&gt; set the whole bus on fire to show how everyone who loves their busses can
&gt; see what neglect can lead to! Everyone will learn a valuable lesson. It
will
&gt; only cost the $50.00 I spent and the gas to get there. Anybody want all
&gt; those seats ahead of time?  It is not a camper so I might get those upper
&gt; roof glass and corner glass parts out if anyone wants them before the
fire,
&gt; but is supposed to be a &quot;surprise&quot; thing, so keep it quiet. Let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Might also be a good drill for the local fire department.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
&gt;
&gt; Ric.
