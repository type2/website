I assume your talking about the scraper rubber that goes around the outside
of the door frame. There's no way it was in there harder than my 66.
The first thing I did was make sure that both side's of the channel where
open, Mine where kinda pinched closed. Then I took a small blade screw driver
and looked for place''s it was loose. As I found a piece that moved I worked
the screw driver behind it and popped it out. I found the once you got a
piece started the next one was  way easier. I have replaced every seal on my
66 accept the pop out glass to frame (that one looks nuts) and those where
the hardest
