&gt; Yea, I love how much plastic filler they use on thier bodywork. Pop riveting

&gt; I saw one where they added a hood kit to a Chevy Luv, and holy cow, that
&gt; filler must have been 1&quot; thick! I can't imagine how many times the hood will
&gt; be closed before the whole thing crashes off of that thing. I used 1 quart of
&gt; filler on my entire 62 bug, most of which got sanded off. I bet they get thier
&gt; filler in 5 gallon buckets by the pallet.

These are people who specialize in making &quot;cosmetic customs&quot; that are only
supposed to last long enough to film.  After that, they could care less
about the quality or longevity of their work.
