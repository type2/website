My 53 came with no interior mirrors or sun visors.  Standard micro.

&gt; Interior mirror/visor, I have a question for the list. I have always heard 
&gt;  that square edged mirrors meant that the mirror was earlier.  Thoms 54 bus 
&gt; has 
&gt;  a square mirror.  I recently saw a 53 with a rounded edge mirror that is 
&gt;  original to the bus.  This makes me think that the year might have nothing 
&gt; to 
&gt;  do with square vs round mirrors. Any thoughts on this?
