Hey everyone,

Another fix you might want to try is repositioning the dump valve.  At least
that is what I call it.  It is the brass tube in the middle of the carb,
right below the choke plate.  Remove the carb,hold it level and pull on the
throttle arm and see if the dump valve shoots the gas straight out of the
carb.  If it hits the side of the venturi or the throttle plate it should be
moved until the gas comes out of the carb in a nice stream.  This will
deliver the fuel right into the intake manifold when you try to accelerate.
This was the most dramatic improvement out of all the other fixes I tried.
I also covered the hole in the throttle plate and drilled out the idle jet
to the next size up.  The timing is 32 degrees total and for the most part
my bus is running great.  I drive over 400 miles a week and it holds up
well.  By the way my bus is a 1965 panel that was converted to a camper.
Still not sure who the maker was though.  See ya
