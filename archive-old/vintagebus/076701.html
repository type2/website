Subject: Re: [VB] Bus needed in central cal for photoshoort

Billy,
 
They didn't want my doublecab and Karl's 13 window is causing people to open doors on every street he drives down. My 21 window has 21 empty holes, waiting for paint. 

Dave Smith is the marketing director for Pelco, nice guy. Mention my name if you see him. 

Should be a fine day in the foothills. We can meet at Sequoia Brewery, formerly Butterfields, on Olive Ave. in the Tower District just west of Wishon Ave. I'll wear a VW t-shirt. 

BTW, on Saturday I saw a primered Kombi with a sub hatch being towed north by a U-Haul on 99 near Fresno. Anybody on the list? 

 -Harry
