Subject: A Hoopty engine for a Hoopty owner
Mime-Version: 1.0

Today I vented and asked a lot of &quot;whys?&quot; and &quot;what if's?&quot; to Craig K via
pmail about my fuel problems. (By the way,thanks for the your time &amp; help
Craig) He pretty much re-enforced what a lot of people on the list had
said. The reason I was having fuel under my valve cover and seaping out of
the carb was probably due to a leaky float needle valve. Also asked again
if my engine was at an angle, which would explain why the fuel was only
under the #1/#2 side. 

So I'm staring at the engine (installed in the bus) sitting in the shop on
a nice flat surface. Yeh it's flat. Well...? I grab my level and sit it in
the engine bay. Sure enough it's leaning slightly to the passenger side.
Damn, it is un-even! 

So I decide to pull the carb one more time. I've done this about 7 times in
the last 3 or 4 days. I take the top off and the needle valve seems fine.
It seems to be working as it should. What gives? I go grab a beer and sit
down with my books. I notice the instructions from the carb re-build kit
that I had used stuffed in one of 'em. I saved that thing for a reason! I
start looking at it and actually READING the instructions. It says
something like &quot;gasket for float needle valve.&quot; What? There wasn't one of
those on there when I originally took it apart! What is up with me not
reading the instructions!!!!! You'd think I learned by now.

So I go dig out the box of leftover gaskets and parts. Find the one I need
and install it. Put the carb back in. Start the engine and let it run. Wha
La! No more leaking.

Moral of the story. Don't be a dipsh*t like me and read the dang
instructions. Just 'cause one wasn't there I didn't put one on and didn't
know any better. If I would have read the instructions I would have saved
myself a few days of messing with it and thinking about it too much.

Engine status has now been upgraded to beater engine status. It is now
purring nicely. All the extra work I did timing and setting up the carb
really paid off. Got the choke working. Engine starts right up when I turn
the key. No gas pedal. Runs and keeps running. Now I'm gonna move on to
putting the oilbath aircleaner in. I gotta find the little bracket for it.
Maybe I've got one in some of the junk I've got.

p.s. I had asked Craig about a leaky valve cover. He told me the best way
to take care of it is to make sure the spring is real hard to take off. I
found another one lying around that was much tighter and put it on. No more
leaks.

p.s.s. I'm a beer drinker. I prefer darker beer. Shiner Bock is my &quot;bottom
of the food chain&quot; beer w/ E.K.U. being one of my favorite choices.
Unfortunatly my tolerance is very low and I have to pace myself (native
american blood I'm told). So I don't drink as much as I'd like. This means
no beer when working on VW's. My stepdad had some Oduals Amber Bock, which
is non-alcholic beer, a couple of months ago and I tried it. It wasn't too
bad. So now I swig that when I'm working and it &quot;feels&quot; like I'm drinking
beer and tastes pretty OK as well. It's got a little bit of a watery after
taste. But it's alright. Nice alternative to sodas.
