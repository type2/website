Liquid wrench

patience

Apply pentrating liquid and remove bolts.  You may run into a problem
with the lower rubber bushing staying on the car and not coming off with 
the shock, in which case you'll have to be creative in removing it.
I've had to cut some, others have come off with vice grips and cussing.

Installation is the reverse of these steps.
