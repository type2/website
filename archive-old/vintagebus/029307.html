&gt;&gt;This really frosts my A$$, because it's the second time I've come up against
the Japanese collecting cool stuff. A few years ago I began buying pedal
airplanes and pedal cars when I could find them. Next thing I know, I'm
bidding against staggering figures at auctions for even marginal examples
of Pursuit Planes because the Japanese are using them to decorate shopping
malls...  now they're making repro's and in my opinion the appeal has gone
out of the pedal car hobby because anybody can buy a brand new one that's
99% identical to the original.
&gt;&gt;
It's harder to repro a Bus.

I guess if nobody could afford a house in the USA, we'd pay $20k for a Bus
too.  Of course, it's getting that way, most people can't afford one without
2 incomes.

There's always somebody out there that'll pay more than you for something,
the trick is finding that guy when you're selling and keeping him away when
you're buying.

P.S. I always laugh when I see people use &quot;A$$&quot;.  So you're saying you have
an expensive ass?  Or maybe cheap, that's only 2 figures...  ;)
