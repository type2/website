Um, for the record I am serious as sin about selling
this bus. My fellings are that the bus is a
respectable bus. I dont see tons of humor in the
collective vintagebus_dot_com purchase. To me the
collective purchase pushes it into a less than serious
category. I appreciate the interest but anyone with
the cash, however collected, owns the bus. Do with it
what you will after that. Pass the traveling hubcap as
a joke but back off and let me seriously sell the bus.

BTW: I do have an HO scale version of the bus that
came with it. PO took the time to sculpt a freshair
scoop (and glue on a poptop) =) Will snap a
non-digital shot and post when developed.

&gt;   Now that would be an acomplishment. Best use of
&gt; the list yet. We could have 
&gt; some Brekina Busses made to match the Bus and sell
&gt; them. Profits to help pay 
&gt; for some of the costs. Everyone that buys stock in
&gt; the Bus could buy an HO 
&gt; scale version of it to ease the withdrawl until the
