Hello,

&lt;&lt;..  Here is my question. I've heard of folks putting SuperBeetle 
4th gears in thier tranny, for the highway...&gt;&gt;

I think that they were misinformed when they told you that they
were using a SuperBeetle 4th for highway cruising.  I'll attempt 
to keep the gear ratios in this reply to a bare minimum as they
can quickly mind numbing for all those who do not normally deal
with them!

(For US importation) The Supers started in '71 and ran until '79.
Transaxle-wise, they are the same as the same year Standard
Bugs.  So, for '71 and '72 which came with the dual sidecover
IRS transaxles, the ring and pinion was a 4.125 and 4th was a
.89.  The '73 and ups came with a single sidecover IRS, the
&quot;golden&quot; 3.875 but a .93 4th set.  

The main thrust of this Type II conversion is to retrofit the 3.875 
R/P set with a .82 4th gear.  You can't use the stock Type II 4th 
as during the years split window Busses where imported here, 
the pinion shaft used a woodruff key to secure 4th.  The later 
3.875 sets did away with the keyway and use a splined end that 
mates with a splined gear.  So I have to use a 4th from a '68 
to early '72 Bus 002 IRS, a 3.875 R/P from a post-'73 Type I,
and an 8 bolt differential from a '67 or '68 factory 12volt Type I
transaxle because the 6 volt transaxle ring gears are all 6-bolt
retained. 

One of the nice features of this gearing conversion is that it is
'stealth'.  It looks stock outside, its a mixture of stock parts on
the inside, and it doesn't take any fabrication to mount.  It simply
replaces the transaxle.  Granted, you could fit a Type IV motor
in there and only use stock parts but visually it wouldn't look
the same.  Whereas the transaxle looks like it came that way
&gt;from der fadderlund.
