&gt; Question:  Why not use a late model VW alternator?  They're readily
available, very reliable, and will produce enough amperage to meet your
needs.  It may not be completely &quot;stock appearing&quot;, but if you aren't
going to Pebble Beach the result might be just what you are looking for.

Good question. Who knows what alternator will work in a 1963 Porsche 356
S engine? Any suggestions on models that I could start researching to
see if they'd fit?

My understanding was that the small diameter (as opposed to the larger
diameter?) 912 generator was the only reasonable choice to go when
converting a 356 to 12V.

&gt; Hoping someone might be able to provide some insight to an electrical 
&gt; problem I've created for myself. Here's the background:
&gt;
&gt; I just had my engine rebuilt by Jack Staggs (it's great!) and 
&gt; converted the entire car to 12V at the same time. I used the small 
&gt; diameter 912 12V generator, new Optima battery, etc... pretty standard

&gt; stuff... It ran great and the battery charged fine for about 1000 
&gt; miles, and then I started messing with things.
&gt;
&gt; I added a stereo amplifier and upgraded my headlights to 55W/100W and 
&gt; driving lights to 80W. I assumed that this would be too much for the 
&gt; generator (which I believe is rated at 30 amps), but I thought I'd see

&gt; just how bad it is, and then upgrade once I had everything working.

Well, if you're driving about with all systems ablaze you will overwhelm
a 30A generator

&gt; Well, after about 50 miles of use, it seems I &quot;overstressed&quot; the 
&gt; electrical system and something broke. The generator light is on and 
&gt; the battery no longer charges. The belt/etc is still fine. So, my 
&gt; questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Can I (did I) damage components by trying to pull too many amps? 
&gt; I.e. Can one &quot;burn out&quot; the generator by asking too much of it? I just

&gt; thought my headlights would be dim...

Supposedly, no. You will run your battery down.  However, if there is a
weak component in the generator or regulator you can overstress it to
failure.

&gt; 2. I found a company (Ace Alternator; 
&gt; http://www.acealternator_dot_com/home)
&gt; that claims to be able to upgrade this generator to about 80 amps.
Does
&gt; anyone have any experience with this?

I'm leery of &quot;upgrades&quot; of this type.  What happens a few years down the
road when your generator needs service and the company that modified it
is long gone?

&gt; 3. If I upgrade the generator to higher output, do other components 
&gt; need to be upgraded as well? Voltage regulator? Anything else?

Yes, they work together.

&gt; 4. (bonus question) I'm just curious, what's the difference between an

&gt; alternator and generator? What do I have? Everything 914 is 
&gt; &quot;alternator&quot;, everything 356 seems to be &quot;generator&quot;.

An alternator produces alternating current and uses diodes (one way
electrical valves) to convert the AC to DC to charge your battery.  A
generator uses a heavy-duty commutator to switch the current.
Alternators are lighter and, since the current comes from the outside
coils, there is no need to pass large currents through the commutator.

Question:  Why not use a late model VW alternator?  They're readily
available, very reliable, and will produce enough amperage to meet your
needs.  It may not be completely &quot;stock appearing&quot;, but if you aren't
