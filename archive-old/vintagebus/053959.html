Subject: Winterizing Bus, Bus for Sale?

Hello Listees,

It has been a long time since I posted to the list. My question is what if 
any winterizing should I do to my 65?  Last winter I replaced everything 
mechanical so I did not worry to much about winterizing then.

I also have to consider selling my Bus.  I really do not want to sell her, 
but I have the chance to study in Florence Italy next year and I need cash.

If I have to sell it i want my bus to go to a good home and I cannot think 
of a better home then a Listee's.
If anyone is interested here are specs.
There are many things I am sure that I replace that are not on list, I have 
at least $5000 in receipts, I just don't have them in front of me If you are 
interested email me and I will give you more info.  I spared no expenses!

65 Kombi Walk through,  with new frt, seats and excellent condition rear 
seat

Totally NEW engine from VW Brasil.  All of the accesories Gen. Carb. Dizzy ( 
new elec ing in box), etc. are NEW, NO rebuilds Dog house oil too

New 4.12 Rancho, new RGB's with german bearings. New shift couplers 
including Frt. New shift rod bushings

All New Brake system, cylinders, hoses, some lines, shoes, hardware, etc.

$450 worth of 8 ply Yokohamas

All new light seals, Window Rubber, rebuilt popouts

All NEW wiring harness,

Nos back up light switch

It is in very good condition, it is from Cali and Oregon.  It could use 
Driver dogleg, and perhaps some cargo door rocker work, VERY Striaght body,  
NOT RUSTY, It is a good one to buy, drive and paint later,

Like I said I am not really in a hurry to sell but have to considor the 
possibility.

thanks
