This is better, but still questionable legally.  In most states, it's
illegal to have white lights showing to the rear except when backing
up.  Yellow is ok most places, but might still get you in trouble with
the cops if they're in a bad mood.  For that matter, tapping the brake
lights can be enough for that, but if you do it with sufficient
distance that the person behind you can reasonably be expected to
react safely, it's ok (this catches the folks who like to cut someone
off, hit the brakes, and then sue for whiplash, etc).

This, plus a third brakelight installed in the rear window, would
probably be your best bet.  You might also consider getting some of
that white/red reflective tape that they put on semis (available at
truck parts stores; just like car parts stores, but bigger).

	Dworkin, whose got the tape on his bus - it helps
