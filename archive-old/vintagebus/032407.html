Subject: Re:  [VB] FW: CA Governor Vetoes Vintage License Plate Bill
Mime-Version: 1.0

It was to allow Year-of-manufacture plates on '63-'73 cars.  Currently only 
'62 and older cars can do it.  No clue why it was vetoed, it passed the 
house and Senate unanimously...

&gt;
&gt;Just a quick note to all of you to let you know that the Governor has vetoed
&gt;AB 2058, the Vintage License Plate bill from Assemblyman Mike Briggs
&gt;(R-Clovis).
&gt;
&gt;The veto came on the second to last day of the constitutional deadline to
&gt;either sign or veto legislation. The veto action comes as a surprise, since
&gt;the bill did imposes any costs nor did it have any organized opposition.
&gt;
&gt;We are still attempting to learn a reason for the Governor's action, and
&gt;will have more to say in the future.

&gt;Assemblyman Mike Briggs
