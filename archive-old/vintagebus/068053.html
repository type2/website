Subject: help on becker mexico TR radio 

hello

Since when im not doing body or mechanic i try to do something else, i have a
split bus radio
that im looking to put in my bus one day.

Now its a 6 Volt, but i will use 12 V, so i bought a small resistor unit for
12V to 6 Volt conversion, its the one sold by EMPI.

If there is some listee member that know about this radio, ive set up a web
page to help me understant what connecto is what .

If anybody can help me , just go to my web site:

http://www.chez_dot_com/westfalia/splitradio.html

then email me your knowledge please!

the big wire connector plug into the #3 i bet, there are 2 wire for speaker
coming out from bottom of radio, that all i know (i think)

thx for any help

mike
