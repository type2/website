 Along with some Barndoor parts I found 3 of these and I'm not too sure
 what they go to. Any ideas?
 
 Here's a picture too!

 Thanks in advance,

hey Greg, why dont you get a parts list- there is even one online.

it is a cargo door latch mechanism- used through ch 20-117 901.   the keys 
would be the 54-63 profile.  Yes the barndoors have the key hole through teh 
door, not in the handle.   There is a certain chrome cover for the key hole.
