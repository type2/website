John,

I just did this with the insert method.  It took me half an hour and was really
easy.

Pack tap in grease (hard white lithium is recommended by my local shop tech)
Thread tap in (I pulled it back out and cleaned it out and repacked it a few
times)
Put insert on spark plugs and thread in.

Worked great!!
I haven't reinstalled the engine yet but the plug is back in and tight again.
It was easy enough that I wouldn't be afraid to do this with the engine the next
time if it ever happens again.  I bought the EMPI tap and 4 inserts to go into
my spare parts carry along package for the future.  My local VW parts house had
the tap and inserts.  I could have rented the tap, but it was only $30 some odd
dollars so I just bought it.  Good luck

Aaron
