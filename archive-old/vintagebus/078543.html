Subject: EveryBus 2004

Hi,

EveryBus 2004 seemed like a long way until I just received an e-mail 
from a type2 list member who is already planning to make the trip to 
NC from California. There have also been some rumblings on the 
Canadian Bugpack list about the Canadian Contingent for 2004 making 
the trip. The word seems to be this will be the largest influx on 
Canadians for the event.

For those that are not familiar with EveryBus, EB04 will be the sixth 
annual gathering of VW Transporters in NC. Each year VW Transporters 
from all over North America gather together for a few days of 
camping, fellowship and fun.

EveryBus is open to all VW Transporters from Barndoors to Eurovans 
and everything in between. EB is also a family friendly event that 
takes place in a beautiful nature preserve. The facility has heated 
bathhouses and hookups for about 40 sites. The high water mark for 
attendees is 160 VW Trasnporters and there is room for a few more so 
make you plans now.

Although I have hammered out all of the details for EB04 there are 
links to previous EB events at the web site for those that who have 
not been before.
