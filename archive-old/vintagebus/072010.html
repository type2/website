 Are you saying from a VW &quot;dealer&quot;??  The parts guys at dealerships
 around here balk if I go in and ask for parts for a 1995 VW (almost too
 old they say) let alone a 1965!  What part of the country do you live in?

ya, where is that dealer?   around here they don't laugh if I ask for a 
vintage part, but they really don't have much.  They definately are not used to 
people asking about ACVWs.  There is no point in going there for splitty parts. 

Though the PO (OO) of my mom's 67 bug took it to the dealer every 3K for a 
tune up, until my mom bought it a few years ago.  (stamps in owners manual say 
so)  That was in the Monterey area, in California.   evidently the dealers 
there do still service old aircooleds.
