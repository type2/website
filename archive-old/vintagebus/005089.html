Hi All,

My original owners manual states a top gear of .82, ring and pinion of 4.125
and redux boxes at 1.26:1. The rear tire radius is 12.5&quot;.  Do the math and
it looks like 60 mph is 3439RPM, 70 mph is 4011 RPM and 80 mph is 4583 RPM.
And yes it will do 80 on the flat. ??? Am I doing something wrong other than
breaking speed limits? Let me know.

Thanks
Chris
