Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Auxillary battery

&gt; One key thing you are forgetting, is back in the day...kids weren't
strapped
&gt; in mandatory car seats.  As a kid I remember laying in the back of our
station
&gt; wagon playing board games with my sis or wrestling with my bro in a camper
&gt; shell covered pick-up bed all the way from Texas to Wisconsin.
&gt;

I hear you there, Beto.
A 12-13 hour drive to Sacramento twice,  a 14 hour drive to Phoenix, 14 hour
drive to SoCal, and a 8 hour drive to Vegas each year is real tough with our
son strapped into the car seat. Eventually I do want to throw in a drop down
screen for my son to watch some Sesame Street as soon as he can wear
headphones. Headphones, because I don't want to listen to that crap for 12
hours like he does! LOL

p.s. he does pretty good with small toys while driving, but even a 17 month
old gets tired of spinning the wheels on his toy tractor after about an
hour. Two or three hours into the drive, we're giving him anything and
everything to keep him occupied. Half empty pop bottle, crinkly wrapper,
etc, etc.... haha
