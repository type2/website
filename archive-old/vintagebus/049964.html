Subject: Hasty 'Engineering' (was: Swing axle rear lowering kit.By
 WOLFGANG)

&gt;&gt;     I Need some information on this ad. by Wolfgang for a rear lowering
&gt;kit.
&gt;&gt; It say it eliminates reduction boxes. Will that Make a difference on the
&gt;&gt; FREEWAY?
&gt;&gt;       I'm building a 1835cc for my 65' Dlx. I don't won't the engine to
&gt;heat
&gt;&gt; up when I'm on the freeway will this work? Or what would be the best way
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; go about it.  Aloha Mike
&gt;
&gt;Mike:
&gt;
&gt;The kit they are selling was designed right here at Bus Boys back in the
&gt;80's.  We still sell the kit, only ours come with NEW spring plates rather
&gt;than cut up used ones.
&gt;
&gt;We recommend that you use a type 3 or 68 Bug transaxle with our conversion
&gt;kit. If you want to stay with the wide 5 lug bolt pattern, use any of the
&gt;following brake setups:
&gt;
&gt;1) Early Type 3 complete (the best)
&gt;2) Early Bug Complete with a spacer for the drums (the worst)
&gt;3) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with machined 63 and older Bus drums
&gt;(good)
&gt;4) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with Thing rear drums (good)
&gt;
&gt;The kit is designed to safely lower the rear of your Bus about 3.5 inches.
&gt;Using the Bug or Type 3 trans will give you gearing better designed for
&gt;street and highway driving, but will limit your ability to haul loads of
&gt;cement up steep hills for long distances. Most people interested in lowering
&gt;their Bus are not using them as workhorses anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Using your original Bus trans is not recommended as the best choice. The
&gt;gearing is not very good for use without the reduction boxes. You would also
&gt;have to remove the ring gear and install it on the other side of the trans.
&gt;Otherwise, you will have 4 reverse speeds and 1 foreward.
&gt;
&gt;We have sold hundreds of these kits over the years and have not heard of any
&gt;reports of premature bearing wear or any other failures.


I'm not generally condemning hot rodding or the like, but everyone should
be aware that there are often many carefully engineered factors designed in
to every component of your VW.  Many of these factors may not be readily
apparent at first examination.  You can't expect a part or kit engineered
by a couple of guys in their hot rod shop to be as good as a genuine part
engineered by perfectionist Germans with engineering degrees and nearly
unlimited budgets, using state of the art tools, labs, and equipment (for
the 1960s of course).  I'm not meaning to blast anyone here, so don't flame
me, OK?

Regarding changing the gearing of your bus to slow down the engine at
highway speeds:  We are talking about a powerplant which was barely
adequate for the Beetle, being used to push a much heavier vehicle with
much greater aerodynamic drag.  Air is a pretty poor coolant, compared to
water, and the high engine speed forces the fan to run fast as well.  If
you slow down the engine, you will reduce the heating of the engine very
slightly due to reduced friction in the engine, but the primary load on the
engine will be the same - pushing the bus.  Your engine is bound to run
hotter on the freeway at a lower engine speed.  Now add in the fact that
your oil pressure and circulation may also be reduced by the lower engine
speed, and things get worrysome.  Oil is used to cool the bearings and
valve train of course.  One mitigating factor with a lowered bus may be
lower aerodynamic drag, but I'd wager that it would not be enough to offset
the reduced cooling by the engine fan running more slowly.  If you want a
hot looking bus for cruising, fine, but if you want to take long trips, the
stock setup is best, IMHO.

I have also read somewhere that the side scoops which used to be popular
for split buses (and mine has a pair!) actually block the air through the
louvers.  It seems that there is NOT a laminar flow of air along the side
of a bus, rather there is plenty of turbulence and eddies.  The direction
of the side scoops apparently does not coincide with the direction of the
air around the louvers at highway speeds, thus the scoops actually harm air
flow through the engine compartment.  I can't remember now where I read
this.  Did anyone else read this and can you remember where?

Anyway, another example of a hastily 'engineered' part frustrating the
carefully thought out design of the VW engineers.
