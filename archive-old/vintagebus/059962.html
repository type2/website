Subject: more on roof racks

Speaking of roof racks, is anyone using the new? roof rack made by EMPI? =
It seems EMPI is trying to make parts of acceptable quality again.  I =
just wonder if their rack is acceptable or just junk?   It is priced =
better than the parts-is-parts rack, plus does not need modified to fit =
a double cab.  Also, years ago, I heard bad reviews of the PIP rack.  I =
assume they have honed their craft as they are still selling them.
