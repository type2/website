Hi Paul, due to computer problems, I unfortunately do not have the ability to 
look at pictures.

So, if I understand, you want to know whether the prehat pickup should be on 
the right or the left, and 
where you can find the pickup tube.

'70 edition splitty parts list  has 
113 129 511 A    adaptor pipe   / from engine no. 7 336 420       34-, 42- 
bhp (no picture) 
211 129 511        adaptor pipe   / up to engine no. H O 150 202     44 bhp - 
this is pictured as the  J version

go the the preheat tube section, and there it is listed as a 900 mm tube for 
motors up to    5 000 001 (1.2l) and up to H O 150 202 (1.5l), 
but for 630mm for engine from H 0 150 203     why? and no pick up tube is 
listed!

if I look under the heatexchanger section (aka heater boxes)

if shows that they are sold with pre heat openings both left and right.  says 
for left one to plug it off with the plug 113 255 117

for right says to seal it off with that plug  up to Engine No. H0 150 202.

meaning that from that engine number (end April 1966) the pre heat air as 
taken from the right side heat exchanger, instead of from the underside of 
the cylinder head.

so if you want your 67 to be stock, you do it from the right heater box.    
This involves having the rear tin w/o preheat holes, the front tine with the 
preheat hole on the right, and the right heater box with the preheat pick up 
hole.    Otherwise,  you do it however is convenient.
