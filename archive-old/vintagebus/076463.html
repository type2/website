Subject: hoop height

Can someone give me a measurement from the bed of a truck to the bottom of
the hoops at the highest point?
I'm looking at a truck that has cut down factory hoops. It comes with left
over pieces from the hack, but they don't look like they would be enough to
put the hoops back to stock height.
