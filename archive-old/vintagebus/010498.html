&gt; If you haven't read G. Matthew Bulley's Heat, Rust, and Noise 
&gt; website I
&gt; would go check it out NOW!

The site is good. I'm sure that the bus that got the treatment must be as
quiet as a limo. The po of my '57 kombidid an insulation job using nothing
but sheets of polystyrene behind all the panels and the headliner. Don't
know how good this is for water vapour issues but it has certainly made the
bus very quiet in comparison to my double cab.

I'd like to try out the products mentioned on the site but they are far too
expensive here in sunny South Africa.

Later 

Michael
