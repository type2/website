Subject: air conditioner - split bus A/C

It's true. I don't get out enough. But I have searched the archives
and thesamba_dot_com gallery, and can't find hardly any info or photos of
original split bus air conditioner equipment. Most of what I find
is how to boot in a small home unit. I was amazed to find this
one in a barn in upstste NY. Not much use for it here in the
frozen Northeast, but I would still like to find installation or
any other info.

This air conditioner unit is a Volkswagen Products Corporation
(made in USA),serial # 23-800302 with a high-capacity
receiver/dryer # ZVW401433. It was removed from a 1960
double-door walk-through deluxe panel vw bus. I am looking
for any documentation, including instructions. It does not
have the compressor pump, hoses, or switches and controls.
