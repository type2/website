Hey NQ,
        Are you running 14&quot; wheels?
        Did you have a big headwind?

        I've been running a 3.88 in my 64kombi ,which I converted to a
Westy, for about 2 years
and I've had no  problems.It is loaded with camping gear all summer long,
even with a loaded rack at times.I live outside of Chicago, so our weather
is similiar.
I do have a quart and a half deep sump which does help.
    How fast were you going? If I run full out I'm going 80mph.I suppose if
I run WOT
I would overheat also.But I prefer 65 to 70.

            woody

64 kombi,1600sp pretty much stocker(no doghouse even),009with compu
fire,header.
3.88 trans.,15 wheels.




yet
&gt; It's no secret that putting a freeway flier trans in a bus drops the rpm
of
&gt; the engine in relation to the speed of the vehicle.  With my 1600DP and a
&gt; mild load, it just can't hack it - I was driving floored back from KCMO.
&gt; The engine was working really hard too.
&gt;
&gt; Does this mean that no matter what Type 1 engine size  I run (anything
from
&gt; a 1600DP up to a big old 2.2 litre), I'm condemned to overheating or will
&gt; the 1776 give me enough power gains to pull me out of this slump?  Even
&gt; though I like to cruise fast in the bus, I don't like running hot so I'm
&gt; half tempted to yank my flier and sell it and run the stock 67 trans.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to hear comments and real world experiences.  Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; NQ
