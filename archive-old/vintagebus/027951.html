Subject: [VB] idea!~ vw stickers...

&lt;&lt;Good thinking. Now apply the concept to Chevy, ford,
hotrod, oldschool station wagons, NASCAR, NHRA,
Harleys etc etc. Send me 20% commission of the first
million or 3% of the live long gross profit.

Jim,

Let us not forget those stupid little signs that said &quot;baby on board&quot;.
Or those little crowns for the back window. Or neon lisence plate
holders. I could go on and on.

It seems when it comes to cars, it doesn't matter how stupid the idea
is: some one some where, or some group of people are gonna latch on to
the idea.

Les
