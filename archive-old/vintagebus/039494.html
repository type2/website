just my $.02... and slightly off topic...
that lenny coop guy, although he does turn out some nice restorations, 
whenever i have gone to his site to check out whats for sale, the 
descriptions are FILLED with the word &quot;original&quot;. original this and original 
that. i cant remember now, but the sub hatch westy and an early bug come to 
mind. the bus complete with sony 6x9's hacked into the cabinets and bur bur 
(sp?) carpeting and the bug with WCM interior. that word bugs me.... 
original to me is not necessarily perfect OE condition, but a vw (or any 
car) where everything is from the factory and unchanged. my bus aint ;)
oh well... i dont know where that came from....
