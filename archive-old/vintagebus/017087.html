Nope.  The reserve valve is part of the unit that the fuel line
connects to at the tank.  If you're in the reserve position, you're
taking fuel from a lower point in the tank than in the normal
position.  That's all there is to it.  Thus, if you're always in the
reserve position, you'll have fuel available longer, but won't have
any available when you do run out.  You are demonstrably not running
out.

You most likely have one or more of:

- dirty fuel filter
- sticky float/valve assembly in carb bowl
- weak fuel pump
- plugged-up fuel sock in tank

My experience has been that the probabilities of these are in the
order given, highest to lowest.  So, first check your fuel filter.  If
it's absolutely perfectly clean, then inspect the action of the moving
bits in the carb float bowl and also verify that there's nothing
obstructing fuel flow when the valve is open (float is down).  Et
cetera.

Even a &quot;it's only a little dark&quot; fuel filter can cause this
behaviour.  It allows enough fuel through for the engine to idle.  If
you ask it to run faster, what's in the float bowl keeps it running
for a little bit, but not enough new fuel gets in to make up for the
engine's higher consumption rate, and it all dies.  You crank for a
bit, which is slow, and refill the float bowl, and you can again idle.
