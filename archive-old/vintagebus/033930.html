I second that emotion.  At 6'5 I find I have to tuck the gear shift in my 66 
behind my knee when in reverse.  Fortunately it can pass my knee in first and 
second but just barely.  If I wore corduroys I would have friction burns on 
my right hand.  Hopefully hoisting myself in via the steering wheel while 
planting my right foot inside the cab and sliding my ass across the seat 
while ducking the doorframe at the same time won't damage my steering 
mechanism.  I'll have to keep the faux leather seat covers for the slick 
surface.  Amazingly, I had more room in my 71 SB than my bus.  While the 70 
Baywindow isn't nearly as cool, it is way more comfortable for oversized 
folks like me.  I guess I can suffer a little for my weekend cruises.  All is 
vanity.
