Hello

I was droven down the autobahn to the 50 years of anniversery for the VW
transporter in a sunny weather with about 95 km/h my oil temperature meter
said around 117 C.
The oil temperature meter stops at 120 C.
If I drive longer south and it get's very sunny, I think my oil temperature
meter will blow away.
Is the oil getting to hot ?
If NOT why this high temperature ?
If YES what can I do to bring it down (the oil stick says that there are
plenty of oil in the tank) ?
I have heard that the oil temperature raise with about 10% if the windows
are open, is that right ?

VWenligt Ciao
