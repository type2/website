Subject: Roof Rack FS

Hey all,

Located in San Jose, CA (since everyone asks this question first) I have a 
4ft long Hot-Dog-Fred-Built roof rack and ladder for sale.  Vintage nuts, 
please note, this is not an original rack and ladder...It's in good shape, 
complete with brackets and locks.  It could use a repaint, but it 
incredibly useable...but my reason for selling it is that I never use 
it.  Whenever I go camping, it winds up on there for show and I'm able to 
fit everything inside.

I'm asking $200 or best offer.  You'd probably need to come to me to pick 
it up, I'm willing to travel a little ways if someone wants it 
delivered.  If you're nowhere near San Jose, I can talk to a reputable shop 
I know and see if they'll ship it, but I make no guarantees.  Buyer would 
obviously have to pay shipping.

Thanks,
-Taylor
