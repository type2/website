Subject: Re: eurotails

okay... maybe a dumb question, but did you ground each separately?
also, i noticed with my repro-eurotails i used to have, that the bulb holder 
was really crappy. so make sure its actually making contact with the light. 
get out the test light and see if any juice is getting back there.
