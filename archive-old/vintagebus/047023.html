I guess the subject says it all.  I'm off to L.A. for the Classic weekend and 
&gt;from there....Germany!!  All pending orders should be processed and on the 
way.  We'll be returning the 23rd of June.  If you have any question, you can 
always leave a voice mail or send an email.  I will try to check them from 
time to time.  Although, I'm sure work may be the farthest thing from my mind 
for the next week and a half.  Updates, pictures, and hopefully some 
memorable stories to come.  Late!!
