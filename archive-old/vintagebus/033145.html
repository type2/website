&lt;&lt; Best to heat up some roofing tar...apply an even coat around the perimeter
 of the sheet metal just forward of the window lip just prior to
 installation of the glass/seal.
 cleans up wll with mineral spirits and not harmful to your paint.  Works 
really well.  Might be a bit of a bugger years and years later when cleaning 
it up for another seal/glass replacement..when isn't there lots of work on 
these tho huh? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
We had to replace a window about two years ago when hit center on the 
passenger pane.  We just used a foot to remove, and then quickly cleaned all 
chips of glass from the old seal that we had install about fours years 
earlier and reused it on the new pane of glass.  Then just retarred the seal 
and body frame, and installed.  Two years later no leaks!  Eric&amp;Barb
