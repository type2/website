Subject: HELP NEEDED - Stranded Listee with overheating 1600 engine
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 2000 16:34:31 -0700

Last Friday a couple of us in the Tacoma/Puyallup area got called by the
owner of a Westy whose engine had crapped out big time on I-5 near Federal
Way, Washington.  He's traveling the West from his base in New Orleans, and
got our names from the AIRS site.

We got him towed to Oval's Motorsports, a large and well-reputed aircooled
VW shop in Federal Way, and he camped in their lot 'til they opened Saturday
AM.

Earlier this week they determined that his &quot;recently rebuilt&quot; 1600DP engine
[according to the PO from whom he bought the rig 3 months ago] had a rod
gone and was such a pile of junk that it was beyond salvaging.  A long block
was built up for him and installed in the '71 Westy.  After all was
adjusted, sorted out, and tuned up he was sent out on I-5 for a test run,
and within 10 miles the engine had heated so severely that it fried the
shop's 250 degree &quot;warranty seal&quot; on the new engine.   The timing was
retarded a few degrees, the mixture was re-checked [Oval's is fully equipped
to do mixture and emissions checks, etc.] and he was sent out again.  Same
result.

This is a dead stock 1600DP, with a nearly new Mexican or Brazilian
carburetor.  The 009 that was on the engine has now been replaced, although
I don't have info. on the new dizzy.  The brake booster has been replaced
and replumbed, as it was shot and leaking vacuum.  Based on what Dan has
related to me by phone, it sounds like a straightforward, basic,
uncomplicated 1600DP engine replacement.  The new engine has been built up
and installed by a highly competent and experienced crew at a reputable
shop, but they're apparently stumped on what is causing the overheating.

When I looked things over last Friday evening the engine room was a
disaster, with big gaps in the tin and strange wiring hanging loosely
everywhere.  No way would I have headed across country with things in that
condition.  Despite all this disarray Dan reported no heating problems in
his westward journey.  Presumably all that has been set right in the
rebuild/repair process [the bill now exceeds $2000.00].

The owner of this bus, Daniel Winkert, has now been stuck for a full week.
He's obviously anxious to return to his home in New Orleans, preferably at
the wheel of his bus.  If anyone out there has some ideas or insights we
[and the Oval's crew] have somehow overlooked please respond ASAP.  Dan has
no e-mail or 'net access, so I'm the contact person.  He can be reached
directly by cell phone at: (504) 296-6652.  Ironically, many of the List
experts are in the Seattle area for this weekend's Vintage Classic events,
and have driven unaware within a few hundred yards of where Dan and his sick
bus are located.
