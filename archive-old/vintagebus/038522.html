&gt; I'm wondering what color front seat upholstery my '66 Westy should have.
&gt; I'm guessing that it came with grey salt &amp; pepper, but the seats were
&gt; recovered by the PO in black aftermarket basketweave.  Anyone know for sure?

As far as I can find it was called &quot;mesh grey&quot; #83.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
