Hi all,
I must admit that I sure do enjoy reading about all the neat (dating myself)
things that happen to us Bus nuts as we take our 30 plus year old vehicles
out on the road. Its nice to know that I'm not the only one who, has learned
the hard way NOT to let the kid with the impact gun install my new tires, or
.. you really can drive a bus with a broken clutch cable from Boise, Id. to
Sacramento Ca. if you have to and it's 1am. when you start, and my all time
favorite... the absolute pride you feel when your wife says, don't worry
honey you don't need to install that starter today ..I can always push start
the Bus if this one doesn't catch.
Seriously thanks a bunch for all the great stories they help motivate me in
the ongoing saga of restoring our busses. Have a great weekend.
Britt
