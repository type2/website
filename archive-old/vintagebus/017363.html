&gt;  The end is near

Reverend Jim seems to have found his end sooner than the rest of us.
But because it is already Friday and the week end in some parts of the
world,
can we ask Shawn Madison if he'll lend his 
sunroof bus for a pulpit at Jerome?
Or if Ellis has seen any of those 
Chem trails trailing behind a black helicopter?
And  if by chance, he was sniffing them 
out in the middle of a massive solar flair that cooked his dura mater?

You know we are just kidding Jim,
But are you mad that Y2K never happened?
Bet you had a Baygen wind up Barndoor stored in a bunker, Huh?
Or did your world end when Art Bell went into a time machine 
after remote viewing Satan?

From Makaha and Santa Cruz from Tampa at the wheel of a split,
good night America and let the Friday follies begin
Aloha,

Ken
