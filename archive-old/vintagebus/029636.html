OCTO was good.  Scored some parts for my '55 Kombi, NOS and otherwise. 
Thanks go out to Hal with the '55 Panel for the good deals on Barndoor stuff
and Mark for the cargo latch deal.  Has anyone else noticed that there are
a lot of Marks into Buses?  Hmmmm

My wife laughed at me because I carried around a 3-spoke steering wheel
I bought for a while instead of walking out to the car to drop it off. 
&quot;You just want people to ask you about it.&quot;   Maybe.  ;)

I saw a few new Buses there, nice all-original '64 hardtop Deluxe, a camoflage
Double Cab, a guy with a &quot;Free Dog&quot; that had #1 and #2'd all over his cargo
mat.  Someone needs to be VW-trained, heh-heh.  I saw Darth VW but not the
owner.  

Pre-OCTO, I took a look in the Recycler rag and headed down to San Juan
Capistrano, south of LA, to fill the trunk (wife's car) full of 36hp parts.
 The seller was a great guy, we struck a deal for me to just take everything
VW he had (not that much) and he took great pleasure in telling a couple
people that called while I was there that &quot;Someone bought it all!&quot;  My wife
was worried that we were going to blow out the rear tires with the weight
of a couple 36hp engines but it turned out they were 10 lbs. low on air.
 A Double Cab would have done the job nicely...

On the way back Sunday afternoon, we saw Jim Ellis' ex-Ambocamper heading
out to LA on top of a tractor trailer.
