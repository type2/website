I am a little worried that I  may have put too much oil in the transmission
and
reduction boxes.  I read that together they should take 3 litres total.  I may
have 3.5 litres but I can't be sure.

I get the family size bottle of gear oil (1 gal) and it takes most of it.
just over 3 quarts.   Fill the RGBs first till the bubbles come from teh axle
tubes.  (the oil will drip out of the center section now if the plugs not in)
   You can get a pump that attaches to the stay lube container.   Warming the
gear oil up makes it easier to pump (sit in sun or a bucket of warm water)
