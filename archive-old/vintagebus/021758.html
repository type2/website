Hi Volks,

can't we just agree to disagree on that one?  Some like the lowered 
look, some (including me) don't, and some actively hate it.  Okay.  
So let's not keep this flame war going, okay?  If someone wants to 
lower their bus, by all means tell them how to do it right (and why 
they should reconsider :-), so that they don't do it wrong.

You know why there are still nice original VWs being customized?  
They're too common, and hence too cheap.  If you invest $20k in 
customization what does it matter if the bus cost $500 or $5k?  Let's 
just pay more, until they can't or won't afford it.  When did you 
last see a customized 356?  ;-)  (Not entirely kidding...)

So I vote let's stop the evangelization, we won't convince each other 
anyway.  Just like with Clara and the sunroof deluxes in fact ;-)))  
Deal? 

Yours,
    Erik.

There are many good cars available for $10k today - e.g., 4-5 VW buses.
