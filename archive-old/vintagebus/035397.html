Hi Paul,
The best thing you could do is to install a 1971 and later dual master
cylnder into any pre-1968 bus.  Wether or not one is converting to discs.
Costs about $50.00 for both a new MC, a few wrecking yard parts for the
conversion, and about two hours of time to install.  That way if one of your
wheel cylinders, or brake lines suddenly leaks you should still have 50% of
your hydralic brakes working.  The single circuit MC in this same situation
results in no hydralic brakes only the wimpy E-brake!   Eric&amp;Barb
