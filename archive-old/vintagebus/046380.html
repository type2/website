yes bryan, they are so cool they are worth any hassle. how dare you  even 
think that!!!!

(I took them out of my westy-  its a daily drive rin the PNW, the safaris are 
now in Bakersfield, maybe being used today)

roofing tar is not a fixall for safaris.  Though mine dont leak between the 
glass to frame seal, or under the seal on body,     The water will leak 
around between the body seal and the frame at the wiggly spots by the 
latches.  This is with an original set of safaris and real latches and seals 
that were NOS when they were put in the bus about 4 (?) years ago.    A guy I 
know got a bus w/ original safaris w/ lotsa paperwork from new with , 
original owner kept taking it to the dealership to get the windows adjusted, 
new seals, etc, they just leak.  its the way it is.  good for desert 
climates, or people who dont mind wet dash tray and holes in the front floor. 
  I replaced the package tray in my westy because of the all the rust holes 
in it- probably caused by leaky safaris.    plastic box box for radio sounds 
good I guess.
