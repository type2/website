Subject: RE: [VB] Hoover bit/oil cooler seal on DP 1600

  For bus travelers/non anal retentives, I have found the best way to route
the fuel line in to drill another hole through the drivers side bulkhead,
from there you can run a fuel line up to a remote canister filter, such as
an AC Delco, Fram (I know) or a Holly. These have real nice fuel filters in
them that are replaceable and keeps the fuel filter away from the engine
and/or electricals. I had the AC Delco in my old 62 panel and in the 4 years
I drove it never had to replace a filter. You can us a propane/LP gas valve
on the outlet of the filter to shut off to rempve engine and also as a theft
deterent.

Yeah, as John says, I run a long gas line.  I don't
coil it over the trans, though.  I coil or stretch the
extra fuel line in the left &quot;battery tray&quot;.  Does
wonders for hot days here in the desert, because the
fuel is in the cool air flow from the left vent (NO
vapor lock) and I can sometimes pull my engine, do
what I need to do, and put it back without
disconnecting the gas line at all!

Fuel hose is cheap, and I never have a piece that's
too short.

&gt; Scott,
&gt; There is always that little bit that comes out at
&gt; least.  Sometimes more.
&gt; JP runs a long line.  Seemed good to me.  I've
&gt; started doing the same.
&gt; I coil the extra above the transmission.
