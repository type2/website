I went shopping for tires today for a set of 15's I just cleaned up and
repainted. I was looking for a 6 or 8 ply sidewall to avoid the &quot;snog&quot; (
i love that term!) or what I have heard called tire wave. What I found
is that 15' tires are not available in less than a 215/75, which is too
damn big. I was looking for 205/70 or /75, but not one shop culd get
them. One though he might in a trailer grade. 
 All had passenger rated tires at the size.

I have driven splits with both passenger and 6 and 8 plys, and there is
a great difference. 
I hope I do not have to go to bias ply to get the reinforced sidewalls I
want.

For the mean time, I am going with a 205/75 for the 14&quot; rims which are
correct for my buses anyways.  The 15&quot;s were to try to get a little more
height for the final drive ratio.  Oh well....

If anyone has a source for 15&quot; 6 or 8 ply tires in a 205/75 I would love
the info!
&gt; 
&gt; I have used 205-75-15 tires in the past.  Only problem is they feel a
&gt; little spongy.  Buses originally had reinforced side wall tires.  You
&gt; might look at light duty truck tires.  Maybe at Sears.  They offer them
&gt; in differnent sizes to where you could fit them on a bus and get the
&gt; look you are looking for.
