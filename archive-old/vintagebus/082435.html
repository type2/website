Hi Josh,
Did you just replace the brushes?  If not, are the brushes  shorter than the 
steel cages/holders they are in?  If so, then time to  replace them!
  Carrying spare brushes is a must and having some of those cardboard  finger 
nail files are good to have to clean up the commutator without shorting  it 
out.
