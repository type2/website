Hi,
Try finding a 2:1 lower pulley.  These more often than not have a &quot;D&quot; that is
about 3/8&quot; tall stampsd in the rear face of the pulley.  You will either need
to then try a 910 belt or four or five extra shims with the belt you have now.
The latter will increase the fan speed even more, to give you more cooling.
