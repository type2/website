&gt;That would be GREAT!!  We'll start a bus racing club down here in KC if you
&gt;think that would help.  I dibz number 53 (Herbie)!!


Darn it!  I just comissioned my brother to make me a set of magnet 53's (aka
Herbie) to put on the bus.  Well, I guess I'll go the next logical step and
make it 01 (aka Dukes of Hazzard.) :-)  I'm also going to get some various
stickers put on magnets to stick all over to make it look like a racer.
I'll just tell them I'm gettng it ready to race at the Bus Nationals in KC
and Bandimere this year.  No one says you have to win. :-)

So far, my list of bumper stickers is going to be:

Don't you just hate getting stuck behind a Volkwagen Bus?

Hey Chrysler!  Just WHO invented the minivan?

I hate Beatrice, Nebraska

(That last one will really rile them up!) :-)
