Not necessarily.  Could just be that the generator isn't in quite the
right position on the stand.  Feel around the edge of the fan while
you turn it by hand, to see if you can figure out where it's
interfering.  If you can't find it, loosen the strap and push the
generator forward a bit.  Otherwise, pull it back a bit.  Tighten
down, hand-spin, listen/feel for interference, repeat.
