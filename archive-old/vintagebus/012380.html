Just to be nice, I posted a message to the 911 list, &quot;WTB 15x6 Fuchs&quot;
and got about *20* replies!

The *Highest* price was $200 each, which would be $800/set - still
considerably less than the $1000 the seller wanted.  Prices
were in the $350-$500 range overall.

If anyone wants a set, I'll forward you some of the messages.

Thom
