Miami-Hazelhurst
Took friday off from work and left Miami after dropping the kids at school
approx 9am. I stopped for gas after about 45 min and looked at the right
real axle nut, loose and complaining. So out with the dogbone hammer and
pliars and i snug it up good and the pin wont fit thru the po bunged up
nut. A few with a file and all is well and me and my companion Keebler the
Red Lab are back underway. All is well when we stopped at the I95 rest
area before St Augustine for a stretch and I notice a pretty good drip
drip of oil from the sump. Dog in the car tolls back out I see one of the
sump nuts is backed nearly out and find it stripped when I go to tighten
it. Mind racing in Hoover mode I dig out all the resources. I tried other
screws, wedging bits in the threads etc and nothing gave me a good
feeling. Finally I clamped the acorn nut in with a small vise grip and
asked for directions to the nearest hardware &quot;next exit St Augustine its a
good ways&quot; off I go watching the oil pressure 3:30 pm. All well I find the
Ace Hdwr ask when they close &quot;6oclock&quot; and purchase a 1/4-20 tap and some
short machine screws and lock washers oh and a pil to dump the oil in. Oil
drained I was going to pull the whole plate so I could keep the shavings
out but decided to see what I could do blind and as it turned out oil
was running down the tap flushing the shavings out. Tapped and torqued I
clean up and head off for an auto supply to recycle my oil and replenish
my supply. Now I had planned an oil change before leaving but never got to
it so maybe it was the bus' way of getting attention. Time approx 6pm back
on the road. It was pretty much as planned from then to Hazelhurst where I
arrived partway frozen (no heat south florida bus) at around 9:30. 12.5
hrs and around 470 miles wow Im slow. Unable to find Charlie Fords house
again (deja vu) I call him from the grocery and he come to meet me. We did
some shopping for sandwich supplies and beer and it was all hanging out
until bedtime.
Next part 2/3 A day w/ DaveR.
