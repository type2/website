&lt;&lt; I remember Eric &amp; Barb mentioning this technique a while back, and so I was
able to retrieve that from my memories and use it... Thanks, people... Other
listees have also mentioned the same, &lt;Fred Stoermer, George Lyle, and Bob
Hoover??? (I think that they all have said something to that effect at one
time or another)&gt;, but for some reason I remembered Eric &amp; Barb's mention of
it.  Maybe it was the fact that they said something about using newspaper to
make gaskets to go between the
reduction box halves that stuck out in my mind as unique, reminding me of
those tables that you used to see at all of the Wendy's restaurants with
repros of old newspapers under the laminate...
	I wonder what I'll need to remember next...&gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Glad we could help with jogging your memory.  Newspaper would probably do fine
for reduction gear box gaskets.  Though we find that phone book pages are of
finer and tougher material.  Use the attorney yellow pages for this, probably
the best thing ambulance chashers did was provide all of those full page adds
just for us to make gaskets out of.  Eric &amp; Barb
