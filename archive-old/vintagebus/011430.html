Subject: 63 Rear Hatch
Date: Sun, 05 Jul 1998 01:26:17 PDT

What is the best way to restore the hinge at the top of the rear 
compartment hatch? On 63 and older busses the rear hatch is a hinge, and 
it rusts, mostly due to design I suppose. What is the best plan  for 
this piece? Can I remove it without too much trouble? Sand blast, POR or 
what?
Jason
