&gt;Why doesn't my bus start in the cold?  It started yesterday in 5 degree
&gt;weather...but now its -10 degrees...

Isaiah,
have you looked to see if the fast idle cam operating level has 
sprung back into the cold start position. On my rebuild every once 
and a while this does not release and spring back when I depress the 
accelerator. In cold weather my bus will not start if it does this.
Its a long shot, but you may one to take a look to see if it needs a nug.
