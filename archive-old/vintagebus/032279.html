Wow! That's very cool. People will give you a lot of flak for it, but it's
actually as original as a Sundial, EZ or Riviera camper. There was a
company (name slips my mind right now) that made these conversions back in
the day. I believe it's made out of a single cab, right? Anyway...we had
one for sale in our classified ads about 3-4 years ago. I'll dig through
the archives and see if I can get you any info. I'm pretty sure the ad had
the name of the company. What part of the country are you located in? The
one in our ads was in Escondido, CA.

Any pictures of the inside?

&gt;just have an opinion, I would appreciate an Idea of how much to ask for this 
&gt;thing. last run in 94 when po's got too old to use it. also if you have any 
&gt;idea what company(s?) was doing this to buses that would be great to know 
&gt;too.
