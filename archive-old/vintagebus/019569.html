Don't cha just love how its only the 'puck' owners
thatcome back defending the wonderf vw-ness and
tremendous 'value' of the pucks. :)I found dozens of
pucks in germany $300-$800

USD..tottaly mint units $1000 shipping is $500-$700
max...the internet is a far reaching tool...check
overseas if you wanna save some money.  Or pay the it
was in Hot VWs, VW trends HYPE prices $3-6 grand! 6
months later you'll wish you hadn't.
