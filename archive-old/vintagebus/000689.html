Count us in!  The only swatch we have of the original is what was under the 
seats.  The PO made curtains that fit beautifully but the color is all wrong.

On the mice problem we wrote about months ago - we took the interior out - 
every little bit.  There are so many droppings on the springs from the bed 
seat that we took them apart and put foam in them for now.  We have tried 
everything to clean the springs and they won't budge.  The most successful 
was prying them off with a putty knife.  We saved all of the seat parts for 
future use if we can ever figure out how to get the smell out of things!

Anyone have any idea how to clean the padding that sits on top of the 
springs.  This stuff doesn't seem to be horsehair - unless it has been waxed 
or coated with something.  The PO may have replaced the original pad with 
something else.

The bus is covered and sitting in the garage attached to the house - sharing 
space with the 98 Beetle.  The 67 Beetle is in the barn with tons of moth 
balls.
