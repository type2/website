Hi Steve, 
Probably the Bugpack clutch TO arm is giving you the problems!  We looked 
into thier new oil filter/pump and found that it was only good as an ash tray 
due to sloppy machining!  So it looks like they sell good scrap metal 
advertised as VW parts...  Retorque your axle nuts, and do the same for the 
bolts that mount the RGBs to the swing plates!   Eric&amp;Barb
