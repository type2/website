Subject: Lost Causes


Having this not-so-romantic inclination in saving lost causes, what's the
general concensus when one should takes one's losses in the Get The Bus
Running field, and run?

No, I mean, barring finances, because obviously in my case that factor is
secondary to eating or paying rent.

I mean the condition of a bus.

And as much as I loathe any sentence that ends with a question mark, that's
question one.

For a long while I lived in the pollyana world of my first bus that I had
for 20 years. My poor second bus, is one major pill. Whatever is fixed here
goes wrong shortly thereafter there.

Question 2 is: And run to what?

Where does one acquire a more palatable example of a functional VW splittie
anymore, that doesn't require re-manufacturing (as in a factory) the entire
thing on an indiviual's budget?

Who &lt;italics&gt; wouldn't &lt;roman&gt; want to keep a bus that wasn't beyond hope?

I can do the basic upkeep myself (it's not intelligence nor desire, it's
physical limitation), but more involved things, more appropo for
professionals are shunned by shops in my area (understandably so, since time
is money), and what I'm seeing in this regard is more and more shops will
NOT work on your bus for the things you don't have the tools to, and if they
do, it's done pretty badly.

Thoughts?

Craig
