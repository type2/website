Hi Thomas,
Yes, slide under an inspect while you have a friend turn the steering wheel 
back and forth.  When you do find the problem and fix it make sure to check 
all the rest of the front and rear suspension!

&lt;&lt; i made it home-very carefully-it was not a smart idea to drive it, but 
didn't want to have it towed-so i can steer it but the response time is 
bad-loose-i have to turn the wheel at least all the way around to turn it at 
all. &gt;&gt;

Hopefully you kept at or below 15 MPH when you drove it home!  This is one of 
those things that could have been a very $$$$ in damages if it completely 
went bad at the wrong time while driving.  Making a tow charge seem like 
nothing.   Eric&amp;Barb
