&gt;Well, Billy is doing crazy Billy things in his bus, and not paying
&gt;attention.  Billy manages to stop BARELY in time to avoid rear-ending the
&gt;stalled car.  John in the slider behind Billy on the other hand, is not so 
lucky. 

For those of you that do not know Billy, this means that he has single 
handedly destroyed three split buses in the last three years.  Oh well, at 
least they were all wide hatch buses ;-)
