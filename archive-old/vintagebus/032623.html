Subject: RE: [VB] Tie Rod Replacement Suggestions?

what exactly do you mean? procedure? tools?  
i use my hazet 779 puller (which i sell, too) to pop all the tie rod ends. 
this tool does not effect the boots and fits in all the small areas on the
bus (mainly the two ends of the draglink). then i eyeball the new rod
length versus the old one and try to get them as close as possible then
install them.  if just replacing the tie rod ends, you'll have to guess. 
the most important part is that you get a professional alignment when all
is said and done.  then adjust your draglink (if necessary) to straighten
the wheel.

&gt; Any suggestions for replacing tie rods &amp; drag link?
