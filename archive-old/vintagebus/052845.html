&lt;&lt; When did the air vents go from innies to outies, and was there a
 different change date for trucks? &gt;&gt;

Hi Greg,
Actually they went from outies to innies!
From chassi # 1 080 104, 6MAR63.

For trucks the parts manual list:
 261 813 355 C  Rear panel corner part, left (with louvres)
from chassi No.802 986 (31JULY61) up to 215 190 000 (1 or 2? AUG65).
Does not specify innies or outies change in rear corners during this time!

Chassi # 216 000 001, which was AUG65 the begining of 66 model year when they 
went to the forward innie air vents and corners without any vents.
