Subject: Brakes Lights/Continuation of 67' MS Question..

Thanks again for the responses in regard to my dilemma. I now have very little play in the pedal, as well as a nice braking motion (not pulls to either side). I'm assuming this is all that I need to do for now? Nonetheless, I now have a new problem--my brake lights will not go out. :(  I replaced both brake lights switches today as well, as they were defective. The strange thing is this: if I loosen the adjusting nut on the MS push rod back toward where it was before, the brake lights will go off, and then function normally when I depress and let up on the pedal (though then I am back to having way too much play in the pedal). As soon as I start tightening it and get to a certain point they come on again. I'm really frustrated at this point. :(  Again, any help would be greatly welcomed and much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance,
-Justyn Shultz
