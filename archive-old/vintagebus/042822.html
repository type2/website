JP and Splitnosers,

  In normal rain no, if I wash it with a hose yes.  It seals pretty well,
but like most rubber seals, they tend to shrink over time, thereby causing
openings in the edges. I put the roofing tar on the frame edges, and
although that is a messy job, I believe it will help, probably I try
puting a small amount in the openings for a better seal?

  Glycerin (which I sell at my store) really helps keep it looking shiny
black new and tender (I do two applications a year.)  On the hot days, the
rear safari are the answer for fresh air flow (since there is no place for
the air to go, unlike the Westy with the jalosies) and of course;
depositing rubish in the back.  I wish the joints of the safari's would
not rust so quickly, I clear coated them before intallation which I
thought would take care of that problem.  Now, I dont know what to do
about the rust.

Best,
joe
