Hi TBear,
For DP intake manifold/s to the heads sealing area we have heard the best is 
gaskets made by oneself from material you can get at most FLAPS.  Shucks has 
one type that is a black cardboard material that is intended for exhaust 
gaskets, but is fuel proof also.  Get the thicker material (Think it is 1/16&quot; 
thickness.).  Eric&amp;Barb
