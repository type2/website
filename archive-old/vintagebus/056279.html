Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

Hey, I once went through the windshield of a second-owner, 20-year-old VW
bus that, minding its and my own business and extensive history with it, was
suddenly, literally obliterated by an SUV.

Poof. Just like that.

Except the &quot;poof&quot; part. That sounded more like metal , asphalt and head
injuries.

So note: *Had* I been wearing a seatbelt (not required in pre-1968 vehicles
in my state), given the front of the bus being instantly reconfigured as the
back support of the front seat, well, forget it. So, screw the governmental
panacea, and hail the literal definition of &quot;accident.&quot;

Be here now, as they used to say.

Strangest injury? That accident: Going through a plate windshield, and save
for the immediate effects, actually zero from which I didn't recover.

Unless you count my brain -- because the whole thing just pissed me off. I
was driven to acquire another one.

No, no, no -- I mean another vintage bus.

I suppose the only caveat is, is that it doesn't matter much how careful you
are driving (and bus pilots are customarily, accutely alert -- unless you
count any typos).

It's more about this other segment of society that can dash all your works
and dreams and very existence into oblivion by their incredible proclivity
for &quot;Oops. Was that my SUV? ... I think I hit a cat... or something... are
we late?&quot;

Now *there's&quot; a strange injury.

Craig.
