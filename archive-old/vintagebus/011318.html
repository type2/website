&lt;&lt; (1) Can the flasher unit be burned out if the connections at the stalk are
wrong?( I tried a couple of combinations  so far without success).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Yes it could be!

 &lt;&lt;(2) Is there a way to test whether the flasher is still functional?&gt;&gt;
Yes, install it in another VW.

&lt;&lt; (3)Is there a routine for determining the positions of the of the three
 uncertain wires on the stalk?   &gt;&gt;
Well you can switch around the wires as you have already done.  On some
flasher relays you have to hook two of the wires to the same terminal, but
since this flasher worked before it should work the same if they where
seperate.

In our 1960 panel we are using a singnal flasher relay with only two
terminals.  On one of these terminals we have two wires connect to it.
1. Medium blue wire with white stripe.
2. Black wire with green stripe and a white stripe.
The other terminal has only one wire attached.
3. Larger diameter black wire with white stripe.
