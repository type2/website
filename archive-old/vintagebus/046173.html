Hi Steven,
Yes that will work if you take your time.  That is the way I learned to do it 
while as a machinist in the USAF.
 
&lt;&gt;
Thanks for keeping us informed we were wondering.  Just found a Brazilian 
doghouse cooler that is just like the earlier in shroud cooler with a 
L-shaped sealing bracket welded to it!  So it shows you never completely know 
what is out there!
