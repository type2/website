Subject: re:wheels&amp; tires

I am looking for information on wheels and tires for my 67 Type 2
deluxe. I
want to go with something fancy in wheels but not too expensive and as
wide as
I can get in the space. Looks like a lot of 15&quot; wheels are available.
But
little in the way of 14&quot;. Any suggestions??

There are more varieties or aftermarket 15&quot; rims than there are 14&quot;
rims.  I like keeping with the wide 5 lug pattern that way you keep your

cost down as well as retaining the stock wheel pattern if you ever
should choose to go back.  Unfortunately they do make many wide 5 lug
rims wider than 5 1/2&quot; wide.  If you have a lowered bus with a straight
axle than you can get a little wider rim in the back.  If your bus is
stock, than 5 1/2&quot; wide is probably about as wide as you can go.  I like

the EMPI repro 5 spokes.  Chromies are always nice looking and you can
use the stock hub caps.  Any other type of bolt pattern will require you

to use adapters or to redrill the drums.  Quite expensive.  Good luck
and hope this helped a little.
