&gt; Additionally, this trick [lifting the fan shroud to remove the
generator] works best for non doghouse.

Just for everyone knows, doghouse fan shrouds have an additional
fastener on the front (FiF) of the shroud that ties the shroud to a
small bracket on the front of the oil cooler.  This fastener can be
removed with the engine in place by folks who were born with an extra
joint in their arms.

When I replaced the generator in my '71, I was lucky that some PO had
left this fastener off.  This omission seems to be more the rule than
the exception (another MX-code?).  I'm lucky that it was, as I
wouldn't have known about it and would have probably broken something
getting the shroud up.  At the last engine removal, I did a complete
tin overhaul (which was more difficult and took longer than the engine
work!), so I now have the correct fastener and bracket in place. Next
generator change I will have to pull the engine.  OTOH, I'm no longer
dumping cooling air out of the bottom of the oil cooler! :)
