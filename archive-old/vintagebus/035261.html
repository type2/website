Mucho ditto!!!   Complain, complain, complain, but when they sit in it they
are grinning from ear to ear.  Peel back the sunroof and they can't help but
stick their head out.  Drive down the road and they are amazed at all the
&quot;thumbs up&quot; the bus gets.

...and they want to know why I like my busses!!

 I explained the difference between driving a car and riding in style, how I
 feel no stress from traffic, the fact that my Bus is going up in value, and
 how the equivalent of their car payments will give me a factory-fresh Bus
 within a few years when they're ready to trade-in.  Weird thing is, once
 this person had a ride in it, they liked it. &gt;&gt;
