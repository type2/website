Subject: More coat hook stuff, 66 dlx qs


I'm not sure where the assist straps go on my interior. As
I understand now, I need TWO straps (Wolfsburg got em), on
EACH side of the bus, rear of the cargo doors, the hooks
holding them down... and then one more coat hook behind
the driver seat? Can anyone confirm this?
