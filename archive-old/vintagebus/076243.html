Where are the nazi admins when you need them!

.....

I doubt the fisherman and the surrounding residents thought it was a &quot;hoot&quot;.
I've surfed in Socal so I know about natural seep age of oil but I doubt
that anywhere on the planet 11 million gallons are dropped into the water in
such a short amount of time in such a small area. Where that the case the
coast's would be lifeless and covered with dead organisms just as Prince
William Sound was.
 It has not fully recovered either. There are a few species of birds and
fish that have not fully recovered to pre-spill numbers.
 I know accidents happen and the crew and Exxon paid them as they should
have, the way that crew was run was pathetic. As consumers our biggest
&quot;vote&quot; these days especially, is with our wallets. Does not buying gas from
Exxon make a difference to them? More than likely not, but I'm &quot;voting&quot; my
conscience.
 It's really no different than my refusal to buy anything new from VW. They
are screwing around with what I love so why would I want to help them be
successful.
