Dear Folks,

Thank you for your kind e-mails and responses to the last trip report.
Thanks to Steve Dolan for the great photos from the meet. We did have an
awfully good time!

From our hotel in Florence KY (just south of Cincinnati) Gus and I headed
across the Ohio River into Cincinnati proper. A friend of ours who lives
there described it as being like Atlanta was in the 60's. I think he meant
that the people were actually nice which they are. Nice drivers too. I was
impressed by the way the city rose from the river up onto a steep bluff. It
was really neat looking and I wish I had more time to explore.

But duty called and we headed up through Dayton past a buffalo farm (that
was a double take!) and fertile fields with carefully tended houses and
barns adjoining. We looked in vain for a moraine (a hill formed by glacial
deposits) but probably saw them without knowing what they were. Toledo was
interesting too (we saw the really big mosque there) and we wanted to go see
Lake Erie, but time was slipping away and Detroit beckoned.

John Hartranft had warned me about the traffic on I-75 through Detroit and
had recommended that if it got late I try U.S. 23 out of  Toledo up to
Pontiac. It was borderline and I barely squeaked by around 4 o'clock that
afternoon and oozed up I-75 with the early traffic but managed to miss the
real thing.

Gus and I drove up to the Marriott in Troy and got a really disapproving
look from the doorman there. Well, we did look like a traveling medicine
show, but we got a hearty welcome from the little guy who did the valet
parking. He knew all about the VW event in Auburn Hills and had thoughtfully
arranged to have hoses set up for us to wash our cars around back in the
parking garage.

I hopped out and flashed the platinum card (that gets a more positive
response-kind of helps to let them know you can actually pay for your stay)
and we got settled in.

The next morning I got a call from Steve Dolan who had made the trip from
John Anderson's house in West Virginia and had wound up spending the night
at the local K-Mart parking lot after a very tiring drive. He had had half a
stale bagel for breakfast. We decided we could do better than that so jumped
in Gus and went to pick up the helium for the balloons (thanks to John
Hartranft who had gotten the info on the party store and so made it possible
to reserve a tank) and went in search of FOOD. We found a little Greek place
that served breakfast all day and stuffed ourselves with their delicious
eggs and toast. We had just enough time to get back to the hotel and unload
the Hubcap and Tour Box and for Steve to put his tools away (we have the
same work habits) when it was time to head over to Auburn Hills for the
tailgate party.

We arrived at VW headquarters around three and met up with some fellow bus
owners and had a great time checking out all the busses. Isaiah Hanback was
there and we got to meet face to face which was a lot of fun. He told me
that he and Stella had come together and that she had done really well. It
was the first time he had taken her that far and was so pleased that she
managed just fine. He introduced me to his friend who had his bus there
(Steve has some wonderful photos of his bus on his web page-it's the one
with the wood burning stove) and we had a great time swapping stories.

The party broke up in time for those who had made arrangements for the
banquet to head on that way and Steve and I went in search of-you got
it-MORE FOOD on the way to the campground in Pontiac. We looked everywhere
and finally found a Chinese restaurant that would do. We ate and decided we
were pooped so Steve headed for the campground and I went back to the hotel
to catalogue the items with the Tour Box.

I had taken a bunch of  photos of the contents (which will be posted on the
web page shortly) and had started doing the catalogue when John Hartranft
called me from the hospitality suite upstairs. There was a great party going
on up there and I went up to meet John and say &quot;Hi&quot; to everybody. We didn't
stay long because it was pretty noisy but we did go downstairs to look at
the Tour Box which John had not seen in person and to go through the
wonderful items left by previous Tourees (Tourists?). That was really fun!
It was wonderful to &quot;discover&quot; the copy of Charlie Ford's manuscript &quot;The
Gift of the Dream&quot; which is about how Charlie got &quot;The Mothership&quot; wrapped
up in the A.I.R.S. t-shirt he had donated. There were lots of fun surprises
in the box, not the least of which is Marv Krupp's box of VW parts that
never break. Yeah, right. Pretty funny, Marv :-) Got us good. I'm still
chuckling. All of the catalogue and the photos will be shown on the web page
as soon as I can get it all set up.

John and I decided to meet at the VW headquarters at 8 the next morning to
set up the booth and so said our &quot;adieus&quot; until the next morning and the
exciting day that would follow.

More about the show next time.

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
