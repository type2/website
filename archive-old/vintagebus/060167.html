Subject:  [VB]    Help '63 stuck in 2nd gear

While driving from Arcata to Eureka  was getting harder and harder to shift
while driving  in Eureka I could only get 1 st gear drove home slowly the
rear shift coupling was seperated. Replaced coupling and front shifter
bushing. Now stuck in 2nd. When I move the gear shift the gear shift rod
moves all the way back into the transaxle it Feels like it goes into each
gear including reverse at the proper H pattern spot( spent hours on gear
shift alignment)  but stays in 2nd OR neutral. Any ideas ? could this be
fixed by pulling the nose cone or should the trans axle be pulled and sent
to a place like Transform( quote $ 610 for rebuild + reduction boxes)
Longs( $ 1200 rebuild + reduction boxes). I guess I'm asking are ther 'easy'
fixes to try before sending it off as I would hate to reinstall it after a
rebuild and have the same thing wrong. And no I don't want to rebuild it my
self I'm working on the '61 Beetle disk brake conversion, the '57 Beetle
stock engine, the Vanagon Westfalia heads that are leaking into the
combustion chambers and the Audi Quattro that my son just stuffed  into a
ditch at 60 MPH ( after flying through the air).   ( CSAA gave me a rental
until they send me a check for the Audi so I've got a couple of weeks to get
something running again)    Lloyd
