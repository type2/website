&lt;&lt; Hey eric&amp;barb,
  Would this help to keep the brights clicked on.  I have the bright in the 
turnsignal switch so should I start there.  When I raise my signal layer 
bright click on but will not stay engaged.   Thanks,   eric   66dlx 12v &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Sounds more like a nine prong relay problem or possibly a wiring problem to 
this.  Still cleaning and soldering all the riveted connections in your light 
switch in our experience seems to be a requirement.     Eric&amp;Barb
