Hi,

I would work with a licensed broker or escrow service. If you can get  
the person to pay your fees, that is a good sign that they are  
serious. (That's the only way I would do that.)

I would ask your bank about any liabilities with a wire transfer if  
you are going to go that way. When I spoke with my bank a couple of  
months ago, there are two types of wire transfers, the old one ABA is  
different than the new method which isn't as foolproof. The new one is  
more like a cashiers check or money order which can be fraudulent.

Conrad
