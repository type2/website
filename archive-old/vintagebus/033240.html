The bus was purchased from the original owner who purchsed it form a &quot;DON 
SHARPE&quot; VW in oceanside california.
The original owner told me this was the interior that was in the bus when he 
purchased it new.
There is also another pre-march 57 standard running around the streets of san 
diego, atleast it was 5 years ago with this same interior, EXACTLY, AND it 
was sporting Don Sharpe plate frames.
Hope that helps clear any confusion.

hmm, since you put dealer installed in quotes, i assume that means you
have no idea who installed it for sure...

This kind of camper interior is made out of plain old wood.  Hotvw's used
to have ads for plans in the back of magazines.  Unless one knows the
history of the bus one has no way of knowing if this is homebrew, sundial,
ezcamper,  or when it was installed. It could have been a home-woodworking
project from the late 70's just as easily as it could be period...

take care,

Steve&gt;&gt;
