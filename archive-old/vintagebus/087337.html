Subject: Re: [VB] Good Wiring Harness?

Hi Greg,
58 and 63 wiring harnesses are way different. See the wiring diagrams  on 
vintagebus_dot_com web site, and compare.
  We would first look into repairing the wiring harnesses.  Most  of the time 
these just require a bit of solder and heat shrink to get a solid  connection 
to repair wires you install on either end of the original  harness.  
Plundering wrecking yards for wiring harnesses for not only  pre-1980s VWs, but most 
any Euro made automobiles of that era will result  in lots of spare wiring of 
the correct size and even colors.
