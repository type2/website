&gt; Dave &amp; I were discussing the chances of a bullet-signalled high-roof being 
&gt; an OG factory item yesterday and didn't really come to a conclusion.

Hi Rich,
Believe 63 was the first year for highroofs.

From 1961-64 Italy and some other Euro countries had those as standard 
equipment due to thier traffic laws.  Check the parts manual for the bullet 
turn signals for specific dates/chassi #.
