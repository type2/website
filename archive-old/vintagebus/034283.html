 I need the exhuast bracket that attaches to the bumper/bumper mount on a
 1966 Deluxe split, PO removed it to install an extractor and bugpack,
 currently leaking..Already have a nice German exhuast to mount, thanks to
 Bus depot. Will the tailpipe stay on/up with out this temporarily? Or should
 I wait until I get one to install?
 
 &gt;&gt;

I believe these were used on 40hps, not on a 66.  you should have the dampner 
pipe, the tailpipe, and a bracket that bolts to the left side of the muffler 
and clamps to the tailpipe and has a flange bolting to the dampner.   
there's a picture at
