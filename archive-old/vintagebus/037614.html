(good or bad) with the rebuilt longblocks advertised in the rags? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Most are junk!  The best rebuilders never have to advertise due to the demand 
for thier quality work!  Ronnie is the way to go for a new engine.  Though we 
would still take it apart and go through it completely, balance the pistons 
and rods down to nothing and install a CW crank.  It is amazing what 
balancing and a CW crank crank does for quite and smooth running VW that does 
not tire you out like a VW without a CW crank on trips longer than an hour or 
two.
  For rebuilt engine we suggest calling Butch at Bear's VW machine at (619) 
691-8385, in National City, CA near San Diego.  If you get one done by Butch 
please tell him we said &quot;Hi!&quot;.   Eric&amp;Barb
