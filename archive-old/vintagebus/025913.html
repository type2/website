&gt; &lt;&lt; That money has to come from advertisers or subscribers.

&gt; I think the only chance of a decent type 2 oriented publication would
&gt; be something like the NEATO newsletter.  And guess what?  It already exists!
&gt; If membership was larger, the resulting fundage could support a larger,
&gt; cooler newsletter.  Maybe even color pix like the one Ty Hodges
&gt; does (Cascade kombi's?).  And the classifieds are to die for!&gt;&gt;
&gt; 

Amen!

A note about the color pic Ty Hodges had done for our Club VW of Western
Oregon &quot;Old Volks Pages&quot;:
Ty is a Quality Manager at Hewlett Packard and has access to &quot;beta test&quot;
versions of some of the newest fancy printers. We ( nor Neato, I
suspect) could afford to make color copies of the quality or quantity
that Ty has on occasion made for us..... 


But NEATO's Old Bus Review is still a great bi-monthly magazine. Lets
support NEATO and get those subscriptions in! And lets have some more
contributions as well. I know you all do cool things in your bus
(ahem..) so write them up and send them in, with a check if you are not
yet a member. 


I am honored that Dave has seen fit to priont 100% of the mammoth trip
report I sent him, but really, if there were a decent amount of you all
contributing, there would be no way he could fit all of my drivel into
the publication.

Write, take pictures, whatever, just send the split-content to

Dave Easterwood
NEATO/OBR
335 Atlanta Street
Marietta Georgia
30060

And send membership dues to:

Neato Membership Coordinator
George Bossarte
Cambridge, Mass 02139
