 the armature shaft.  But I've never had one apart before...it's out of the 
bus 
 so I can replace those shafts.  And I understand the design changed 
drastically
 in '65.  Can anybody who has had one of these give me a little warning as to 
 what I should expect upon opening this up?  It's a 12V '67 Bus wiper motor.
 
Leave the side with the clip holding the cover on alone.  There's the 
electrics under there.   leave it alone.   WHen I have messed with it, it 
ruins the self park option on the wiper motor.  

The side where the do hookickey comes out that turn the wiper shafts- take 
that side cover off.there are some screws, and a big nut to undo .  Well 
first you have to take the motor off the frame assembly.    use a magnet to 
stick the little circlips and nuts and washers to.   Unclip the bits from the 
moving parts on the wiper motor.  Undo the screw holding it to the frame.  
loosen the big nut, wiggle and twist it off the frame.  then you undo the 
screws  holding the cover on.  pry it off, remove the loose gears, wipe out 
all the crusty olf grease, pack it with frreah new happy grease, replace 
cover.  Ya, you broke the seal into pieces when you removed the cover, so 
what, it'll work anyway.  Hook  up the wires from the wiper motor to a 
battery charger or some source of electricity.  quieter?   When you replace 
it on the frame, make sure all those plastic bushing thingys are good- the 
holes are round.  If they are ovalled out, it'll make your wipers sloppy.  
grease the moving parts.

THe wiper motor in my 65 westy didn't even work it was so crusted up when I 
got it.  It would just emit a growling whining protest.  I did this to it, 
and it's fine.
