OCTO was cool, a few good deals, Barndoor Bilstein jack for the price of a
&quot;normal&quot; jack, a couple cheapo 36hp things so my 30/36hp fix didn't go
unfulfilled.  Someone being teased with a smooth tailgate, the &quot;rare&quot; '56
Kombi that had some scary thick house paint on it, and no Zebra Bus.  ;)
I'm sure there's &quot;lost a stripe&quot; joke in there somewhere but I'll spare ya.

Funny how my cargo door latch broke on my Bus a couple months ago (Barndoor
only, yadda, yadda), no one had any latches at the shows for a while, then I
find one at Pomona digging through someone's stuff.  Now, at OCTO, I swear I
saw 6 of them just laid out on tables.  A'int that just how it goes...

A little sprinkle came down, causing the wimps to put their stuff away.  I
can understand the paper goods and pretty NOS blue boxes but dude, I think
your taillight lenses can stand a little water?!?

The freshly restored '54 Deluxe was there, nice Bus.  Owner seemed nice, he
was showing it off at one point, even opened up the engine compartment.

Anyway, I'll put some pictures up on my site this weekend or check the OCTO
site, I'm [in]visible in none of the photos.  :)
