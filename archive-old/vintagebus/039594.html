&gt;BTW, I have a buggy made by B.F. Watson circa 1875 -
&gt;anyone know where I could get a new whip for it?  BWFY
&gt;(buggy whips for you) is all out of NOS ones.

Nobody has them new anymore but:
You are in luck! We are repoing them! Unfortunatly they arent as good as nos 
because they squeek. And the &quot;crack&quot; you hear is tuned slightly different to 
prevent copyright infringement.
However they will work, and do very closely resemble NOS.
