Subject: Friday: Was just wondering....

Hello all,
  I was just wondering if there were any bus organizations that did a
toy run?
(like the Harley riders) If not, do you think it might be something to
consider doing?  We could call it &quot;Josh's Jingle Run&quot; or something of
that nature.  A bus could hold a lot of toys.
