Subject: Flaps position?

How can I tell if my flaps (air vanes) are open or closed while the
motor is installed in the bus.  I can reach around on the right side and
feel them.  When the bus is hot, should I still be able to move them? 
What's a good test to make sure the thermostat is keeping them open when
the engine is up to operating temp?

Thanks.

Steve
