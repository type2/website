Just got mu 66 panel running (?) again.  Been sitting for a few months ( don't ask why).  It will start easly and idle fine.  I can rev it but it has a bit of a stumble up to about 2,000RPMS.  When I try to drive it, it won't run very well at all, misses and stumbles and dies.  If I coast to a stop it will return to an idle without a problem.  
I've replaced the plugs, points,rotor and cap.  Did one of the cheap-o rebuilds on the carb and checked the timing.  Set the valves and put fresh gas in the tank.  Still won't run right.

It's a 1600 DP, 30/31 PICT, 009, in a 66 type2.  
Any suggestions as to where to check next?  I'm getting frustrated with this.

TIA,

Jon
