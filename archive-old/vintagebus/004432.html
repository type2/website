As you've probably gathered from my URL earlier, I made my own tool and
pulled those middle springs out today.  PITA as usual, tools being thrown in
the yard from under the bus, and a host of profanities that I'm sure changed
the neighbors view of who they thought I was.  I can't let the bus sit and I
hate working on it so I just decided to force myself to do the deed.

Tomorrow I'm hoping to start setting the valve train geometry.  This has
been a thorn in my flesh on just about every VW engine of mine I've worked
on.  The minute you go dicking around with swivel foot adjustors, then you
gotta shim this and that and it gets very annoying.  I still haven't gotten
it all figured out so that's why I'm asking.

To let you know where I stand with this rocker arm crap, I got me a set of
Bugpack bolt on rocker shafts.  As of about 2 hours ago they are ready to
bolt on.  But keep in mind the changes I have done that alas, have deviated
from stock.

First off, I've put on swivel foot adjusters which pulls the top of the
rocker out away from the valve stem.  You can only back the adjustor out so
much before you begin to extract the ball out of the socket on the cup
causing binding and eventual breaking of the swivel foot pad.  Add to this
the lash caps on the ends of each valve.  Now where are really sticking out
there aren't we?  I've used some shims under the rocker shaft pedastals in
order to pull the swivel feet away from the valves so I have at least some
room for adjustment.  To add to the final part of the twisted equation, I
spaced the heads out .040&quot; from the cylinders due to the cylinder crush
washers.

Envisioning all of this means that the valve tip end of my rockers is really
sticking out there in lala land. In order to get the geometry back to where
it should be means that I will really have to shim the heck out of the
rocker shaft pedastals which in turn necessitates longer pushrods - yes -
even longer than stock!

I've heard of performance engines needing shorter pushrods but never longer.
Seeings as how I don't want to spend anymore money on this engine for the
time being, does anyone want to trade me a set of longer pushrods for a set
of chromoly stock length pushrods?

Or am I thinking correctly?  It seems to me that in order to even the valve
train geometry out, I need to create some kind of equalization to counter
the addition of the swivel feet adjustors and lash caps and &quot;shortening&quot; of
the pushrods due to shimming the head out farther from the engine case.

I'm going to make my own adjustable pushrod but I will need one longer than
stock.  Anyone have any ideas based upon all this info?
