&gt;Is the thermostat rod the same in a doghouse shroud and a non-doghouse
shroud ?&lt;
Yes, the rods are the same.
&gt;Are there different temperature range thermostats, ones that activate at
different temps.? &lt;
Yes, I mostly have seen 65-70 degree, but there are 70-75 degree listed in
some catalogues.  Maybe the higher temp one is for the fuel injection cars?
I am not sure why you would need the hotter thermostat?
&gt;Anybody have a &quot;hoover bit&quot; they want to part with ?&lt;
If you are near Atlanta I can get you one.  Otherwise the junkyards will
have plenty available if you like to dig :)

I would almost recommend getting a brand new thermostat.  I had two used
ones sitting in my basement and for some reason they were both stretched out
to far and did not retract enough to close the flaps. They should provide
about 1/2&quot; contraction to fully close the flaps.  BTW they do fail open,
this was a question a while back.  Again way too much free time and a
controlled basement stove to kill a thermostat :)  Also do not use a tight
spring on the heat flap connecting rod in back of the fan shroud because
that would effect the thermostat performance as well, as little as needed is
great.

Good reminder, because I need to get a new thermostat from my FLAPS as well.
Good Luck.
