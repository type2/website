See http://www.sema_dot_org/fedleg/stateredhot/ for more info on Scrappage programs in California and other states.

It looks like other states are dealing with the same issues right now.

The essence of the California bill, is that if the car is sent in as part of the Accelerated Vehicle Retirement program (voluntary, or not) it is crushed.  Parts cannot be taken from any vehicle that is to be scrapped under the program.  Despite the difficulties that it appears to be having, what I have read from other sources as well as SEMA is that there is a real likelihood that it may just pass.  Although I do not live in California, other states ARE following California's lead in this.

Cheers,

David

&gt; &gt; For those of residing in California, I am sending information for the
&gt; &gt; Califonia State web site where I found
&gt; &gt; email information to express displeasure over SB285 which now makes us
&gt; &gt; subject to losing our vehicles if they can't pass Smog Check II.
&gt; &gt; Recycling your auto is not an option.  It's paperweight time.

&gt; I could find nothing about turning your car into a piece of scrap if it
&gt; fails testing as you imply.
&gt;
&lt;SNIP some more
&gt;
&gt; Before this becomes a on going thread on the bus list, please spend a
&gt; little more time researching this.
&gt;
&gt; If you look closer to the history of the bill, its having trouble even
&gt; getting out of committee.
