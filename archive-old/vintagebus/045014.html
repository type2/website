 I finally made some new stickers that yu might get a kick out of:
 
 &quot; I beat up 4 hippies and all I got was this dumb BUS!&quot;
 
 &quot;NON-HIPPY BUS&quot;
 
 &quot;Fast Cars Suck&quot;
 
 Need your opinions, a few people have asked me for an old sticker that used
 to say,  &quot; It's not a Van, it is a BUS&quot;    would that be a worthwile one to
 print?
 I must say, everytime people on the list refer to their VAN, I puke and
 wonder how I got on the FORD list.
 
 &quot;HIppy Bus&quot; is also available,  &gt;&gt;

Hi all-

One of the  cutiest Ive seen is &quot;FUKENBROKEN&quot; with a vw guy there holding his
head next to a deluxe bus with its engine lid open.  I found at Wolfgang
International, havent seen them anywhere else.

Suprisingly, I recently managed to get the custom &quot;environmental&quot; plate that
California offers that say &quot;HIPY BUS&quot; for my wifes 21 window.  Of course, me
being me, I doubt I will be driving that bus often :)

For those who know me, I may be off the web for a week or two soon.  Looks
like I will be making a move to the coast afterall.  Thus the reason I am
cutting out my herd.  I just hate the thought of my busses rusting away and me
making the 10 hour round trip over and over.
