Hi Mike,
Definitely not a good idea!  This allows the MC to tilt and eventually 
twist/bend off parts/chunks of the mounting bracket!  Bye bye brakes.   Now 
if you could find a washer that had a big enough inner diameter to slip onto 
the MC....   Also you can slightly bend the brake pedal stop on the body this 
does allow  the brake pedal to rise slightly so if it is lower than the 
clutch pedal this might be needed to get them the same hieght.  Worse comes 
to worse just go out and buy a bolt to cut shorter and radius it's tip just 
like the original pushrod and install it!    Eric&amp;Barb
