Subject: Rheostat wiper control

I got this note from Clara to help me convert my 6V wipers to 12 V

&gt; JP found a stylee rheostat switch you could put in your12V VW w/  6V wiper
motor, then you could have adjustable speed wipers!!!!  think you have a non
stock wiper knob though.

Any ideas on a part number or where to get it?

Thanks in advance
Snoopy
