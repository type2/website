&gt; hm.......   about the 30/31.  I bought a new one about ten years ago, and it 
&gt; has been on my bug ever since.  last year I had to clean it out, after about 
&gt; 40 or 50K miles. 

The problem was poor filtration, not anything to do with the
carburator.  With clean gas and air, they'll run forever.
