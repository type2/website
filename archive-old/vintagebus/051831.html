Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Tank Swap Smells

Ray,

Thanks for the response. I have one hose on top of the tank.  Where/How do
you suppose I vent this? - Thanks


&gt; If you don't properly vent the late model tanks the pressure can build up
&gt; from sloshing and you will get out gassing. Normally this isn't
&gt; too much of
&gt; a problem if the area is well vented, but if it is fairly enclosed, a gas
&gt; fume build up can lead to an explosion or fire. Remeber, you have
&gt; two heads
&gt; back there at 350 degrees plus a hot exaust. Don't add fuel to the fire!

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; A while back I performed the fuel tank swap, retrofitting the 70's tank in
&gt; my 63' Panel.  The problem I am having is a very pungent smell of gas.  I
&gt; tightened the clamps on the filler neck, but the smell is still
&gt; there.  I'll
&gt; pull the engine and tank, if need be, but I was wondering if the
&gt; hose coming
&gt; out of the top of the tank, needs to be vented.   I plugged that
&gt; hose when I
&gt; installed the tank because It didn't have a place to go.  Could
&gt; pressure be
&gt; building in the tank,  causing vapor to leak inside the cargo area?
&gt; Also I should mention, the PO had cut a hole above the engine, like later
&gt; model busses.  I have it sealed fairly well for your garden variety engine
&gt; smells, but not well enough it seems!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance...
&gt;
