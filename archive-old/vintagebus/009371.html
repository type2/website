Subject: 67 Westy progress and question...

*Progress*
Ok. I finally got back to work and installed the brake system on my 67 westy
that I ordered almost 3 months ago from busdepot. Long long day. I think I
worked from dusk til dawn, but I wanted to make sure everything was right.
Of course everything wasn't. I forgot to get wheel bearing seals so I didnt'
repack the bearings or anything yet, just put the front drums on. I'll pull
them back off this weekend and take care of that. I also have two brake
sending units screwed into my bleed screw holes. I didn't realize the new
wheel cylinders didn't come with bleed screws. Thanks Ron. (J/K!) I actually
received great service from them once again and will order again. I also
performed the MC conversion as so described by Eric and Barb on the web
page. Worked great. Absolutely no problems at all. Worked easier than
described even. Only modifications I really had to do was shorten the push
rod. I think it works great, but I haven't got to bleed the brakes yet.
(bleed screws). Anyways, on to my question...

*Question*
Brake pedal Rebuild. I know I'm lazy and haven't read any books or
researched the archives, but strung out working on this and looking for an
easy answer. The brake pedal won't return at all. I'm sure the spring is
worn, but it feels like it is more than that. Any ideas? I really didn't
look into it much as it was very late when I got this far (this was all
yesterday, worked late today and haven't got to get back out to it). Any
ideas or suggestions on things to look for? I'm sure this is an easy
process, but I dont post to the list much anyway and I'm excited about
progress so far. With any luck, I'll finish the brake system this weekend.
Along with sandblast the wheels, install the engine, and if the weather is
nice, even paint it! I doubt I get that far, but it is nice to dream...
