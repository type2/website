Subject: Re: [VB] How much Paint?(taillight trace?_
To: Frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello--
The chassis number is 457 113. I had no idea there was a height difference 
mid year? It is an early 59' panel built in early April and has a crankstart 
apron?
I really have no clue,  that's the first i've heard of height difference and 
the taillights were hacked w/ 62-71 lights when I got it--
could you make me a trace if that's what I need ?

Thanks alot--Pete
