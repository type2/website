Yes either the door handles or the doors will give it away.
68s had push button handles and the push/pul on the door sill.
69 changed to smooth handles and the lock switch is incorperated into the
interior handle.
________________

er- not splitty except that when looking for 67 handles...

look at dash from in front of bus through windsheild, on left edge.  there 
will be a tag with the VIN on it, such as 239 xxx xxxx.  except 69 was the 
first year for the tag, so 68s dont have it.
