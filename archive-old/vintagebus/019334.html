The Obsolete Air-Cooled Doc Project is now back online and _should_ be fully
functional henceforth.  It is 3am though, so things might not work...if so
please let me know.  Changes are, in brief: files renamed in comp-friendly 
format, converted GIF to PNG, added indexes (even originals didn't have these,
so we're proud :-)), new compression (tar.bz2), and cosmetic changes.  The PDFs
are not online and will probably stay offline, unless someone wants to make
them.  With the new naming format most people should find them unnecessary. 
Last but not least, everything that was broken now should not be.

Of course, here's where you can find it:

Thanks to Matt Roberds for carrying through the PNG conversion, renaming, and
indexing for this overworked/lazy student ;-)

Hopefully these changes, particularly the indexing, will make the OACDP more
useful to the VW community.  Enjoy!
