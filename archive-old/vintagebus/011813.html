Subject: It's a write-off (update2)
Date: Tue, 22 Sep 1998 14:26:29 PDT

Well, when I came home last night my bus was waiting for me in the yard.  
OUCH.  Now I can see why the insurance lady was so sure it was a 
write-off.  The other car made contact just behind the driver's side 
door and pushed that section of the side of the bus in about a foot.  
The whole rocker is buckled, the jack point is WAY underneath the bus 
(not that it was really attached to anything anyway) the hubcap from the 
front wheel has a big dent in it (hung it on my wall) and the tire is 
flat.  
The jump seat that faces backwards behind the driver's seat basically 
exploded into pieces, spewing forth parts and tools.  I would guess the 
average body shop would take one look and run away screaming.
So the search is on for a new bus, although it might be quite a while 
before I get the insurance money.
I am so sad to have to give up on my bus after all the trials and 
tribulations we've been through, but as many of you have said, maybe 
it's for the best in the long run.  I'm still stubbornly clinging to 
hopes of having another splitty though.
Thanks for listening,
Diana
