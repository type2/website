Actually the outtriggers and jack point are not opened into the inner rocker 
,,but your about rite ,,there should be a drain area at the frame for the 
outtriggers to drain , but its usually stopped up ,,also when that lip area 
gets rust into it,, it rusts the wall area also and can get bad ,,i'll be 
posting some pics probably in march of a fellow listee's 67 with about 3 
inches of floor cut out back from the back of the seat pedestal to the out 
side wall area and all the posts down the drivers side ,,and probably 3 
inches into the cargo floor area from the inside of the drivers side rocker 
,,Yes Chris ,,i'm talking about yours ,,,,Later
