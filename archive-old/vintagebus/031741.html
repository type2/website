No, it's called a clean gas tank and screen, Did your 55 have the barndoor
style or later fuel reserve tap on it?

When I first started drving my '55 westy, I was plugging up
filters like no tomorrow.  I ran 2 of them in series, and 
*both* of them got clogged.  There has to be a better filter
out there.
