&gt; Let us (me) know what that gearing is in the `70 and I

&gt; compared to the final gearing in 4th on a `66-`67?

Hi all,

from what i have read... the overall 4th gear ratios on a 66 tranny with
the 4.37 are lower than a 68-71 or a 67.

On a 67, with the 4.1(2?) ring and pinion the final gear ratio is actually
_HIGHER_ than a 68-71 tranny....

this makes sense though.  The 67 bus had the same engine as 68-70, but
weighed less by a fair margin.

So, a 67 with the same size tires as a 70 will go faster at a given rpm
range.

I got this info from searching the archives. The particular post was from
todd hill, and icluded all the math to show what the final ratios were in
each of these combinations.

peas,

Steve
