Hello List,
I have decided to put Safari windows in my bus.  I know there is some 
controversy about Safari sources so I am seeking help.  If you have had good 
service from your windows and could recommend a supplier please let me know. 
  I also need to find a source for the appropriate wipers and hardware.  I 
don't mind paying more for a better product.  Thanks in advance.

Boyd Smith
