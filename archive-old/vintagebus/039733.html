First of all, I've been lurking on this list for a while, but this is my 
first post.  So hello all!  Now to the point:

I really love my 67 13 window, but would very much like to have a camper, 
but don't have the time, money or space for two busses right now.  So I 
thought I'd throw out the idea of a trade and see if anyone is interested in 
a straight up trade, my deluxe for your split camper (not lowered, with 
reduction boxes, and not terribly molested please).

About my bus:
1967 13 window walk-thru deluxe.  Little rust, but very solid.  Body is 
pretty straight, paint is there but faded.  Mostly complete and original, 
jail bars, 2/3 middle seat, clock are all there, no major mods.  This is my 
daily driver (300 or so miles a week), very reliable and solid, not pretty 
exactly, but not something you'd be ashamed to be seen driving either.  
Probably worth about $3500.

So how about it?  Anyone with a simliar condition/value split camper on the 
west coast want to trade?  I'm in the SF Bay Area, but would be willing to 
meet someone halfway if it's within a day's drive or so.  This may be a long 
shot, but if it might save me the trouble of selling and then buying another 
bus, or turning my deluxe into a camper, what the hell, it can't hurt to 
ask. :)

Thanks,
Mark
