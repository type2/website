I know that Dawn is still in business...but I know for a fact that she
owes some of my good friends either product she has yet to send or refund
money she says she has none of either.  And it's been a loooong time...
Some of my friends are on this list...maybe they will chime in, maybe not.
But I'm not so sure I'd buy from her right now....
later
