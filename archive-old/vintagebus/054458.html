Subject: RE: [VB] 65 wont take gas

Do you have the fuel cutoff solenoid hooked up?Did you clean the tank if the vehicle was sitting a long time,new fuel lines and filters?Did you adjust the carb?Timing?Was this a running or non running engine when installed.


Too many unknowns to answer the question quickly.
