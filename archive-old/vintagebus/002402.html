&gt;Hello Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;    Has Anybody heard anymore news on the Radio's that were be reproduced.
I
&gt;believe the gentlemen that were making them were making them for 6v buses
&gt;and they were in the works on a 12v version as well. Has anyone heard more
&gt;on the 12v version's and were they going to fit the 67 radio plate?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!
