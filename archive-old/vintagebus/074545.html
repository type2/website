Subject: RE: [VB] Electrical help on 1/10th of a bus

My two cents for what it is worth:
get two lamp sockets. stick some 25 watt bulbs in them and then mount them
in the headlight unit and plug 'em in. Seems a lot less complicated then
power supplies and battery chargers...

As far as bus content goes: I want to buy a project splittie...preferably a
solid rolling body with no motor...

Thanks Volks,
Scott

Wanted: Pre-Bay window bus - project status and CHEAP
