to the friendly and knowledgable list members;

we last left our hero with a hole in his #3 piston one mile from a flying
j truck stop on I-10.
 with the help of a rolling thunder vietnam vet and two fundamental
baptist, he spent the afternoon pulling the top end in a church parking
lot.
he then purchased a 16/half topend and new drivers side head.
 Parts from the semi-retired Rev. Calvin H. Jackson on Rippy Rd. in
Gulfport (looked like most of the NOS stuff was cleaned out but he has
plenty stories. as we say in hawaii try fly em).
the engine was in before dark and our hero went to church as promised.

two questions with out looking in the archives as i am not on the web yet
:-(

ever hear of the british carb called the fish? not a 4/1/99 joke!
 manufactured or sold in the USA by a guy named Brown (lost all info on
this )
 this carb has multi fuel capacity by  rotating the metering tube on the
throttle shaft for infinitely variable fuel metering (Fuel- air mixture
is dispersed through jets on the throttle shaft ) the only problem with
this carb that i have heard about is icing up, not a problem on Oahu :-)

anyone ever run a Grose jet?
it's a fuel inlet valve
 Two balls and not needle/ seat
&quot;two balls do it all&quot;
 sold by D&amp;G Valve Mnfg. co. inc. Stoneham, MA
