Just so you know...They don't allow any non-vws up onto the mountain so if
your gonna fly into Jerome and rent a car,  Either rent a JETTA or bring
your hiking backpack.... it's long steep walk up that hill, and there is no
room anymore for chevys and fords. At the rate that show is growing, I
wouldn't be surprised if they make it air cooled vw's ONLY.
