Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Coil Failed

While we're all recoiling here, I'll step-up with a 
transforming question. What is the advantage of an epoxy-
filled coil? Supposedly for off-road. Any disadvantage? 
I suppose the oil filled would let the coil bang around 
in the case, but it might be better at shedding heat.

p.s. Who is going to the Mother Lode VW meet in Angel 
Camp this Saturday? www.vwswap_dot_com for info. 
I have a small nut tranny out to the backing plates that 
I'll haul up if anybody will give me $50 for it. Or pick 
it up in Fresno anytime.
