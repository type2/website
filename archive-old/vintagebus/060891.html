Subject: Re: [VB] Hoover bit/oil cooler seal on DP 1600

Excellent idea! You can use the extra to replace the 
lower piece or someone else's gas line in an emergency. 

May the extra long fuel line coiled in the left corner 
be forever known as a JP!

&gt; Yeah, as John says, I run a long gas line.  I don't
&gt; coil it over the trans, though.  I coil or stretch the
&gt; extra fuel line in the left &quot;battery tray&quot;.  Does
&gt; wonders for hot days here in the desert, because the
&gt; fuel is in the cool air flow from the left vent (NO
&gt; vapor lock) and I can sometimes pull my engine, do
&gt; what I need to do, and put it back without
&gt; disconnecting the gas line at all!
