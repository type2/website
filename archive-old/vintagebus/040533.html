Hello Everyone,

Since it seems to be a discussed topic lately, I have a question about my 
front end.  I'm currently in the middle of bodywork/rust repair on my bus, 
but I'll be on hold for a bit over the summer on bodywork.  I wanted to fix 
my front end.  The bus sags on the drivers side.  I originally wasn't sure 
if the lean was due to the back end, or the front end, so I put the front on 
jackstands and it straightened out.  The rear suspension appears to be okay. 
  When I took the front end off jacks, the left side drops probably an inch 
or so lower than the right side.  Hmm, maybe I could try to appease both the 
cal-look and the vintage crowd by having a half-lowered, half stock height 
bus...

So what could be the source of this problem?  My thought is that it's 
shocks, or bad torsion leaves.  Probably the torsion leaves.  Or could it be 
the torsion arms?  I'm planning on having to tear down most of the front end 
to find the problem, just fishing to see if anyone had run into this before 
and had some words of wisdom for me.  I do have a bentley manual, it will be 
my guide for fixing the front end.

Thanks!

Mike A.
