Subject: Polarizing a Generator
Date: Thu, 20 Jan 2000 00:11:48 -0500
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id UAA04648

The Bentley manual suggests polarizing generators which have been sitting for a long while or rebuilt.  The manual shows exactly how to hook up the wires but does not say how long the process takes to fully re-polarize a generator.  Does anyone know this time period???  Or is this polarizing procedure worth doing at all?

Thanks,
