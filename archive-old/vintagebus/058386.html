Subject: RE: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

It's not the paint color, it's the insulating qualities of the heat
resistant paint. It was designed to reflect the heat away from itself so as
not to burn. Unless of course you are going to squirt on a thin temporary
coat of rattle can which will be mostly gone in 2500 miles.

I just don't see how a color of paint would increase or decrease an
objects affinity for heat, given radiant heat not being the source.
Seems all paint would be the same to some extent, unless it acted as
some thermal insulator, which is more probable than bare metal.
CPU heat sinks are an example. The density of the copper cored ones move
heat into the huge alumn fins, which get rid of it. Doesn't sound
logical that a black one would do any better of a job, sealed in a dark
case. Now if it was outside, the black one would def be a disadvantage,
since it would be absorbing radiant heat form heat producing light
sources.
So the argument may only be that unpainted cases are more likely to run
cooler than painted ones, and painted cases with lower density paints
(possibly flats?) are better than high density pant that may act as
thermal barrier.

I guess this makes sense. Afterall, the Germans painted the trans and
left the engine case bare. Maybe they knew something?

&gt; Paint can make a great insulator, keeping heat in, instead of letting
&gt; the bare metal radiate it to the cooling air. Now if this was a water
&gt; cooled block, I wouldn't have any qualms over painting it. The
&gt; Transaxle is
another
&gt; entirely different thing, I paint them!
