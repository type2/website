well i did get a case of juice out of the deal, and another 40,000 trouble
free miles in my bus, but it never hurts to try , the deal was that he would
send me an alternator in good working condition, how can you turn down
someone in need of an extra part in a situation like that?

&gt; jb,
&gt; &quot;the early 90's&quot;... are you kidding ;) you'll never see that again. that
&gt; thing has probably powered that dudes bus across the US 10 times by now.
&gt; he's probably burned it up and gone on to another. should have TRADED for
&gt; some of his stash when you had the chance ;)
&gt; later,
&gt;
