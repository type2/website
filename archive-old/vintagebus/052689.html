Subject: Re: [VB] Harber Freight Sandblaster


The HF blasters are barely this side of junk.  I bought one
a few years ago, and fought and fought with it until I went 
out and bought a proper nozzle and hose for it, which cost
more than the HF unit itself.  After all was said and done, 
I was about $50 shy of a professional quality unit.
