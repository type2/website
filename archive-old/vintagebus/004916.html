&gt; Well, first of all, where would aluminum rub against the bearing?  The
&gt; flywheel is steel.

I didn't say that the aluminum would rub against the bearing, I said steel
would rub against aluminum. Steel flywheel. Aluminum (alloy) bearing. Write
500 times on the blackboard &quot;I will read carefully before dissing other
students in class&quot;. 8^)

&gt;
&gt; Second, bearings almost always are made of dissimilar metals, so using the
&gt; shims as thrust bearings wouldn't work too well.  I doubt that they move
&gt; much relative to each other in operation.

You have lost me here. Dissimilar to what? Plain bearings are usually made
of a softer metal than the part that is moving in them so that the
relatively cheap bearings will wear out before the more expensive part. The
shims are a disposable part, but they can't be soft metal, the crank is
ideally not a throwaway. Flywheel-shim-shim-shim-thrust bearing. All parts
separated by a presumeably thin film of oil. The parts with the highest
friction will drive the parts with the lowest. I do not presume to know
where this will be, but I think it is safe to assume that the flywheel is
not spinning at 1000 rpm's while the shims are static. Or the shims spinning
at 1000 rpm's with the flywheel, etc. A Volkswagen engine with 15 - 20
pounds of oil pressure at idle isn't going to support a single shim flywheel
thrust system, nor is it set up to inject pressurized oil between the
surfaces. A Porsche with 50 psi at idle might be, though, I don't know.
Capillary action seems to be the oiling method in the VW. They only need to
maintain the oil film while the clutch pedal is depressed, once unloaded,
they just hang out and spin if they feel like it or not if they don't.
