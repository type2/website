Ronnie at type2parts_dot_com has really been a lifesaver.  I can call him damn
near anytime and he can tell me all kinds of tricks to working on the buses,
provide encouragement, etc.  I can't really thank him enough and I would
hope that if any of you ever need parts or some advice, that you would give
him a call.  When I head down to Cali next year, I'm going to stop and see
him - I really respect this guy - he knows his stuff and in the spirit of
true VWdom, is always willing to help.

The reason I'm saying all of this is that I called Ronnie again today -
somewhat depressed because I couldn't get that damn shift coupler up front
to come apart.  I did about everthing I could and only managed to mutilate
it.  Talking with Ronnie confirmed my suspicion that 1) You must seperate
that rod if you want to remove the front axle at a later date and 2) if
worse come to worse, it's okay to cut the rod, and make your own coupler -
and that's exactly what I did!

Using my air powered grinder, I cut the rod just before the collar.  It
wasn't until later that it dawned on me that I could have just cut the
coupler, chiseled it off, and hope to seperate the rods but at this point,
the mutilation required removal one way or the other.

After derusting the rods, I Iooked things over and went down to the hardware
store and bought a 3/4 to 1/2 bell reducer for plumbing.  In about 45
minutes, I managed to drill and tap some 1/4&quot; holes into the reducer and now
I have a fully adjustable collar ready to go!  I also found a short piece of
shaft that I drove into the end of the long hollow shiftrod that goes back
to the trans.  This way I have some &quot;meat&quot; to drill into in the end of the
shiftrod.  I bolted the reducer to the front shiftrod but for now, the rear
is only held in place from the pressure of 2 bolts.  Since I lost my
reference marks when I derusted the shafts, I'm going to wait until I get
the tranny installed.  Then I'll hook up rear coupler and the gear shift.
It'll take 2 people to this but I'll position the gear shift right in the
middle then loosen the bolts in the homemade coupler while finding neutral
in the trans (halfway between the extremes of 1&amp;2 and 3&amp;4 selection).  At
this point, I'll tighten the bolts and have my accomplice attempt to shift
through the gears.  When all is well, I'll remove one bolt, drill an
indentation in the shaft, install the bolt, remove the other, drill away,
and presto!  I'll also be able to adjust the fore and rearward position of
the shiftrod because of removing about 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; of material during the
cutoff process.  Overall, I'm pleased with the results - it's a kludge at
best but you gotta do what you gotta do.

Back to work...
