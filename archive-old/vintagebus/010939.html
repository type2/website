&lt;&lt; i  need to know
 what type of racks there are or hauling method recommendations. &gt;&gt;

On my 67 Westy, I found that the Thule rack works well, clamps right to the
drip rails. I have the standard width cross bars and the &quot;extra high&quot;
uprights to clear the dome of the roof and the pop top of my Westy. Once you
have the uprights/clamps and the cross bars, any Thule accessory will fit. I
have a wind surfer rack (combo surfboard and mast tie downs) as well as a
bicycle rack. When I carry the bicycle, both racks go behind the pop top.
When I carry the windsurfer, the back rack stays where it is and the front
one move to be in front of the pop top. Thule racks are very well engineered,
and have locks to keep them from disappearing. They can be purchased at most
bicycle shops and sporting goods suppliers who can order any part that they
don't have in stock. They also have holders for multiple bikes, kayaks
canoes, skis etc. I have forgotten the price, but the versatility and
dependability stick in my mind.
