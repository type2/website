I had success making a sealing frame from a single cut and bent piece of
sheet metal. Unfortunatly the camera had no batteries but I will try to
make a scale drawing and pictures this week. It prob took 10 minutes to
make. Tools - Metal Shear, Hammer, chisel, vise, drill. I didnt put the
screw that holds the doghouse bottom to it but could have easily done
it with a screw, nut and one more hole..
