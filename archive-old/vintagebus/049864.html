Subject: Re: Sump Plate leaks


&gt;   I changed the oil in my 65 Splittie (once again, first time) and bought a
&gt;   new oil screen with gaskets.  When I put the new gaskets and oil screen in
&gt;   and tightened it down, and added the oil, it started leaking around the
&gt;   seal..... Question: Are you suppose to get the the cardboard gasket wet
&gt;   first ?  Put gasket sealant on it ?  Use a different type of gasket other
&gt;   than cardboard ? I'm a idiot and I dont know what I'm doing ?  Don't answer
&gt;   that !  Also what kind of oil do you guy's use in a 1600CC engine that has
&gt;   about 4000 miles on it ?  My friend, who is more technically inclined than
&gt;   me recommended Castrol GTX 10W/30, but he doesnt know anything about VW's.


  Jason (and the List),

  Ain't that a pisser?  All-new parts, assembled to spec and the sucker still
 leaks? :-)

  You haven't done anything wrong -- that steady ooze of oil isn't your fault.
 You'll have to do it over, of course, but before getting into that, allow me
 to offer you the benefit of hindsight.

  Back in the 1950's the oil-sump gaskets were cork.  They were fragile things
 but they didn't leak... usually.  (Cork isn't porous.  It has a closed-cell
 structure.)  Then VW introduced a composition gasket, sorta like tar-coated
 cardboard.  They weren't as fragile as cork and the tarry coating sealed up
 the porous cardboard so they didn't leak... usually.  Sometime during the
late
 '50's or early '60's, plain cardboard gaskets started showing up.  They
 leaked.  Bad.   We referred to them as 'VW Oil Filters'  :-)

   To prevent the cardboard gaskets from leaking you had to coat them with
gasket
 shellac.  Doped up with shellac, they didn't leak.  But neither did they come
 off. (Gasket shellac is in fact a pretty good glue.)  To remove the sump
plate
 and wash the screen, you were liable to damage the fragile aluminum flange on
 the strainer-plate, plus you had a devil of a time scraping the gasket
shellac
 off the crankcase (carb cleaner would eat it off the strainer &amp; sump-plate).

  Today, the only sump gaskets available are the ones that come with the so-
 called 'oil-change' kit.  These are the plain cardboard type.  Put a drop of
 oil on one and the oil soaks right through.  And that isn't the right stuff
 for a gasket, not if you want an oil-tight seal.

  There are lots of ways to make cardboard impervious to oil.  We usta use
 gasket shellac because it was there -- and had been for fifty years (an'
forty
 years after that, it still is :-)  But nowadays you have a whole arsenal of
 sealants that can do the job, many of which are much less troublesome than
 gasket shellac.  You can use a smear of RTV -- it makes a fine seal and peels
 right off (and may get sucked into the oil pump too, if you're not careful).
 There are non-hardening jell-type sealants that stay sticky forever.  There's
 even some elastomeric stuff you can spray onto the cardboard gaskets, which
is
 the stuff I use, mostly because there's less chance of something ending up in
 the oil pump.

  But after messing about trying to make a cardboard gasket do what it was
 never meant to do, and several years picking lint out of my belly-button, I
 came to the conclusion that it didn't make good sense to drop the sump-plate
 every time I changed the oil.  And maybe that's what Volkswagen had in mind
 when they started using cardboard gaskets that had to be glued in place to
 keep them from leaking.

  My reasoning here harks back to when those gaskets first appeared, which
 happened to coencide with the general acceptance of non-detergent motor oils.
 Back in the 1930's when the Volkswagen engine was designed, detergent-type
 motor oils did not exist.  Non-detergent motor oils are hygroscopic -- they
 can absorb moisture.  In doing so, they form a thick, jellied sludge.  A
 standard maintenance procedure was to periodically drop the oil pan in order
 to scrape out the sludge and wash the strainer at the mouth of the oil pick-
up
 tube... assuming the engine even had an oil pump(!)  (A lot of auto engines
of
 that era used 'splash' lubrication.  Some continued to do so as late as the
 early 1950's.  The practice is still used in small, inexpensive engines. )

  A key point here is that the screen covering the end of the oil pick-up tube
 is not a filter in the modern sense but rather a strainer.  It's purpose is
to
 protect the oil pump.  All engines use some form of coarse-mesh strainer in
 this location and for the same purpose -- to keep from sucking a 'chunky'
into
 the pump.  Smaller particles, while they can cause wear to the pump, are
 typically pumped right on thru, along with the oil.

  Using modern detergent-type motor oil, there is no sludge to periodically
 scrape out of the sump... and thus no need to remove the sump-plate.  And
 since the oil-strainer is a kind of 'all or nothing' proposition, checking it
 every time you change the oil doesn't make a lot of sense.  If your engine is
 disintegrating internally you're going to have a lot of other symptoms  in
 addition to a few bits of metal stuck to the strainer.  Removing the strainer
 in order to remove the chunky-bits will have absolutely no effect on the end
 result -- if you find a chunky, the proper response is to tear down the
engine
 and find out where the chunky came from.

  In my opinion, the smart thing to do is to put on a real oil-filter.  And
 leave the sump plate alone, except to pull the plug when you do an oil
change.
 On my engines, the only time the sump-plate comes off is when the engine is
 torn down for overhaul

  Now let's take another look at the leaky-seal problem.

  Is your sump plate perfectly flat?  Feel around the stud-holes.  Is the
metal
 raised?  Lay a straight edge across two of the holes.  You shouldn't be able
 to see any light under the straight-edge. (*) On a gasketed surface, any
 'lumpiness' at all is too much.  The sump-plate can't form a good seal unless
 it is dead flat.  Ditto for the crankcase.  Being dead-soft aluminum, the
 flange of the screen-plate can be kinda wavy and still make a seal but any
 wrinkles or tears is a no-no -- they'll form a channel above/below the
gasket.

  If your sump plate isn't flat, make it so.  If you have a lathe, use that to
 true it up.  Otherwise, screw the drain-plug into the sump plate and grip the
 head of the drain-plug in your vice.  Now flatten the sump-plate using a
mill-
 cut file, applied so as to always span two holes. (*)  And don't trust a new
 sump-plate to be flat.  A lot of the 'new' stuff is shoddy, after-market
goods
 -- I've seen some that didn't even have the holes in the proper locations and
 others having holes that were much too large (the proper hole diameter is
just
 under a quarter of an inch... about .245&quot; -- a quarter-inch drill should NOT
 pass thru the hole.  If it does, find a better sump plate.).

  If you start with flat surfaces and use a good sealant on the gaskets, the
 fasteners need only provide a modest amount of pressure to insure an oil-
tight
 DRIP-FREE seal.  The actual 'sealing' is accomplished by the sealant, acting
 in conjunction with the compression of the cardboard gaskets.  In effect,
 you've glued-on the sump-plate, the fasteners are only there to keep it in
 position when the engine heats and cools.

  Veedubs don't have to mark their spot :-)  Most of them do, of course.  And
 people seem to think that's normal.... and maybe it is, for their engine.
But
 it doesn't have to be like that.  (The '86 Toyota pickup I got from my
brother
 leaks more than my '65 bus.  I'll let you figure out who built which engine
 :-)

  --- ...as for the asterisks...

        Some sump-plates, typically those found on later-model VW engines,
have
 a raised lip just inboard of the bolt-holes, making it impossible to file or
 gauge across more than two holes at a time.  I've found it best to 'flatten'
 this type of sump-plate in the lathe... or to just throw them away.

        And for those of you who DO have a lathe, turning a sump-plate out of
 half-inch aluminum plate... mebbe with a bit of engine-turning or your own
 custom drain-valve ... is the sort of week-end project that pays a dividend
of
 smiles every time you change the oil :-)  -- rsh
