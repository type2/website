Subject: Re: [VB] Mirrors &amp; seat belts now installed, with Q's ??

Thanks for the reply
I had a long talk to Clara and she could not find the part number with a 
suffix C in her manuals. She found one with a suffix H in a bay window parts 
book. Thus there is some reference manual somewhere with this mirror in it!
From the box you can see that they are NOS mirrors and they are certainly 
made for a pre-67 bus. I have seen a firetruck with those mirrors and several 
commercial bay windows in Germany had similar mirrors.
Ah Ha!
I have also found a picture of a firetruck with these mirrors in 'Das Bulli 
album' by Andre &amp; David Sparrow. I bought this book in Germany &amp; think it is 
a German translation of a British book. I will post the cover &amp; the picture 
on the mirror page.
