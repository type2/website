Subject: Re: [VB] Tail lights

I suspect the taillight circuit.  Liscence plate light powers of the right 
taillight you know.  Get out a test light and see if there is power at the wires 
to the taillights.   take your print of the wiring diagram and go to the next 
junction and test there.   eventually you will find power, and odds are that 
there is a bad connection somewhere.  If there power at the fuse for the 
taillights?   check both sides of the fuse.  if one side has power, the other not, 
hm, bad fuise or bad connection.   if spinning the fuse helps, you oughta 
clean up the fuse connections with fine sandpaper or something.

 Neither tail lights work.  I recently put new og tail light housings in both
 sides, new grounds on both sides etc.  In addition, my license light is not
 working either.  This is happening in spite of the fact that my turn signal
 and stop lights work. &gt;&gt;
