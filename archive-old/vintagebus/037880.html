Subject: seat compatibility??

Hey there gang.  Im so glad i found this list.  After months of riding in
discomfort Ive finally found some suitable donor seats for my 64 sundial
(1/3 2/3).  My question is whether they will fit.  They are coming from a 59
(1/3 2/3).  Does anyone know if i'll have a problem with this.  They are in
mint condition and I would hate to get them if they wont work.  Thanks for
any help you can offer.
