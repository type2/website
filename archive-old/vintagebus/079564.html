Subject: Re: [VB] Front Inner wheel bearings, what is going on?

Hi Wade,
The front wheel bearing are supposed to be a slip fit onto the spindles, 
unless they have been messed up by previous burnt bearings.  Your bearing supply 
shop or VW FLAPS can and should be able to order the proper ID fit, and this is 
part of the code the bearings are listed under.
