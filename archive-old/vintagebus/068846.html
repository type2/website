Subject: TR: [VB] Ate MC rebuild kit question

hi

after some email i received i decided to buy a new one instead of rebuilding
it, i thought rebuilding was as safe but i as wrong here!!

Now why the dual circuit isnt safer here?  my first reaction was to go buy the
adapter kit and a dual circuit MC 71-79.... i thought then it was the safest
way!

Now  why isnt it safer?  if one circuit fail on the dual, you still have
brake, on the other MC if one circuit fail you have no brake at all ?

Michel,
	Those old bus master cylinders are still pretty cheap, just buy a
new one.  Rebuilding the old works but you need to hone out the old one
and the rust pits in the bore cannot be too bad or it will fail.  I
would not go to the dual circuit cylinders.  The are not safer.  Eric is
not right here.  Gary Gibson
