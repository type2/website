 Does anybody know what part of '62 VW went from small hatch window to
big hatch window?  Was it the early quarter?  Also...does anyone on list have
a spacer for the front left drum shaft of the '62?  TIA

the 63 buses had the small rear hatch, 64 s had the large.  Was a model year
change, not calender year change,

I have a space (aka thrust washer innit)
