&quot;More to the point, it's when cost of doing business exceeds profits, 
whether
that is due to poor management or other factors.  Barrett ran multi-page
two-color ads in every issue of every VW magazine. Same with Johnny's.  This
probably cost them a good ten grand a month in advertising alone.&quot;


That is correct. Those big color ads cost BIG BUCKS!  With so many people 
using the internet these days, it seems as though the huge magazine ads 
should not be as necessary as in the past.

Businesses should run small monthly advertisements letting consumers know 
who they are and what they do and then print their web site address. Maybe 
mention a few exclusive or new items in the ad.
