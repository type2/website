Subject: Re: [VB] Bakersfield VW show report

It was a nice show for sure. Plenty of shade, a great setting and the option to camp the night before is always a good one.. 
I agree with ronnie, this could give Kelly Park a run for it's money as far as being able to accomodate a lot of cars and people. 
 
Congrats to NEATO and John Foley for hosting a great event.
