Subject: hippies? Re: [VB] Re: &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

hmm... maybe I should have been more clear.    

I'm not anti hippy or anti pot smoking (I think there are some people who really should smoke pot and mellow out)  

I am anti stupid idiots coming up to me and acting pseudostoned &amp; yelling in some sort of parody of a stereotype of the 60s and thinking it will impress me. (or my bus?)  Or thinking having a VW means I am stumbling round messed up all the time.

&gt; &gt; I can't be the only person annoyed by stupid middle aged clean cut wierdo
