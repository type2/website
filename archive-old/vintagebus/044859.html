I for one would be very interested in watching this show.  If you could post 
more details it would be greatly appreciated. I have an '89 vanagon that I 
would love to put a V6 into.  I know this is not the Vanagon list.....I 
couldn't stand it and unsubscribed some time ago from that list.  But since 
it's a 'virtual Friday&quot;..........

Thanks in advance,
