Subject: Re:  [VB] FW: CA Governor Vetoes Vintage License Plate Bill
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

for those of us who don't know, like me, what was this bill supposed to do?
.............. -- - --  -- - - 

Just a quick note to all of you to let you know that the Governor has vetoed
AB 2058, the Vintage License Plate bill from Assemblyman Mike Briggs
(R-Clovis).

The veto came on the second to last day of the constitutional deadline to
either sign or veto legislation. The veto action comes as a surprise, since
the bill did imposes any costs nor did it have any organized opposition.

We are still attempting to learn a reason for the Governor's action, and
will have more to say in the future.

Bill Bird
Communications Director
Assemblyman Mike Briggs
