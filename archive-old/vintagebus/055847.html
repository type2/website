Subject: RE: [VB] Synthetic Oil Test 

  Hi all,=20
 If synthetic oil 'did not' have the heat carrying properties of dino =
oil,
wouldn't the results be just like Hart's?  The oil temps would show a=20
'lower' number because the cylinder head heat is not being removed
by the oil, dipstick would feel cooler also.  What we need is to have a
cylinder head temp gauge and do a test first with dino in there and=20
then with synthetic and see if in fact what the &quot;head&quot; temps are doing.
 Just my thoughts and my thoughts alone.
