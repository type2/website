Subject: Re: [VB] Diminished list activity/Jerome

&gt; Unfortunately, Gus and I won't be going this year. After we thought
&gt; about it we decidede we needed to postpone that trip and put that money
&gt; aside for our wedding. So for that weekend we will be camping in the
&gt; redwoods near Pescadero instead.

Hmmmmm! Why don't you do what Dawn &amp; Richard did a few years ago,  Get
married at Jerome!!!! Kill many birds w/ one stone. Just think of all the
cool VW wedding gifts you would get from all of us bussers who would get to
be there.    Grin


Tom Buese-I still remember the bride &amp; groom's outfits of orange t-shirts,
cutoffs &amp; hi top tennies.
