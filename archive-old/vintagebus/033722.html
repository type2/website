  Friday subject on Monday:

   You all know what the Great Race is, right. Well, our illustrious tourism
board somehow talked them, Great Race (sponsored by the History Channel) to
make Lake Havasu one of there overnight resting places. So here's the deal,
on Thursday the 28 of June they arrive in Havasu, at 5pm the city is having
a little street fair in there honor, the cool part is that the streets (main
street) downtown will be lined with VINTAGE vehicles, including all the VW
Buses. so if anybody wants to come and see or join in feel free to come.
