oh it is, it is...  ::sob::  You were right about it being Taiwan.  On
the back side of the hub cap is a Taiwan sticker.  I found a good
parts supplier in Orange a city in Orange county in southern
California.  Sometimes they're called BFY Obsolete parts and they
advertized in hot VW's taking a whole page.  Can anyone recomend this
place to me?  I just got their parts cataloge in the mail today and so
far so good.  The cataloge itself was put together very well with a
plastic linning for the cover.  I'm thinking of getting my next set of
chrome parts there.
Not VW related but yesterday I was nearly attacked by a stray dog.  It
was in some kind of park area behind all these houses that goes lower
into the earth like the opposite of a hill.  I barely made it...  the
time it takes you to realized how much trouble your in and what to do
about it then to run up a tree 10 feet away but struggling to get
there because theres so much weeds.  It tore a piece of my pants just
before I got hold of a tree limb and pulled myself up.  I must of been
up there for 10 min. yelling for help (even yelling &quot;fire&quot;) but nobody
heard.  The Dovermen later lost interest and I got a way with a few
minor cuts and bruises.

There are a lot of different processes of chromeing, the key is in the
prep.
Taiwan cheap chrome uses a single dip method, bassicaly clean and
polish the
steel and dip in the chrome vat. Quality chrome uses a few more
processes,
1. polish and clean the metal.  2. first dip in copper. 3. polish
again, if
any imperfections polish and dip in copper again. 4. dip the copper
coated
piece in nickel, this gives it a dull finish, 5. dip in the chrome
solution
then you have a finished product, this is what is so called triple
plated
chrome which in reality is the old school way of doing it, but they
had to
name it to make quality chrome sound special. If you have cheap chrome
that's rusting best to just replace the part as you will peobally
never stop
the rust.

just my opinion

Sounds like cheep chrome plating to me.  Now days many repop trim
items have
hardly any chrome on them.  Replace or re-chrome these items.  Is the
rust
only showing up on chromed items?  Most hubcaps you get from the
vendor
whores are horrible with regards to plating.
