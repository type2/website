&gt;Anyway, all my electricals seem fine (or how they were) and now both my
&gt;gen/oil light come on and sometimes stay for a long time!

At first glance, the warning light wires are grounding out someplace.
Each light has a feed from the ignition switch and a long wire running
back to the engine.  If these long wires ground out it can make the
lights come on.

The next time this happens, go to the back of the car and unplug the
oil switch wire.  If the oil light stays on then probably the wire
between the switch and the light is grounding out somewhere.  You can
do the same test with the generator light wire, but it is usually a
little harder to get to.  Don't disturb any of the other wires on
the geerator or regulator, just unplug the warning light wire.

&gt;Anyway some back ground, have a blue wire that is ALWAYS hot not hooked 
&gt;up out of turn signal stalk, 

That's a different problem.  The blue wire should go to your hazard
flasher switch; it runs the bulb in the switch.  It appears hot because
of the leakage current through the turn signal flasher.  Hook a tail
light bulb between that blue wire and ground and the bulb will blink
on and off.

&gt;brights click but never come on!

Check all fuses plus the two brown wires coming out of your turn 
signal switch.  The brown wires operate the beam-switching relay.

&gt;When I hit my signal the oil idiot light blinks w/ my signal arrows.

It sounds like the wiring on the back of the speedometer is a little
mixed up.  Make sure that what you have matches
http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-65-usa-key.jpg - you may have to
take out the parcel shelf or the speedometer to be able to see itt
well.
