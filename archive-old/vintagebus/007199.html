&gt;AFAIK you can.  Since I have bolted a 1600 into a split case tranny (buildt
&gt;for 36hp) and you can put a upright in a pancake bus I believe you can use
&gt;the same piece of flywheel to test start anything 25hp through pancake.   I
&gt;have such a piece of a tranny, and switch starter bushing/starter to match
&gt;the 6V or 12V FW.  Also useful as a starter test item.  Mine is just a
piece
&gt;of bell housing, not a stand.


FWIW, you can use this rig to run the engine sitting on the ground as long
as you make sure things are well braced, and don't intend to do it so long,
a 4x4 chunk laying under each head or heater box depending on how much it is
assembled is OK in a crunch.  In fact if you don't have the scrap
bellhousing Clara mentions, consider just using your own tranny if it is out
as well.  Now pancake T4's (or T3's for that matter) are particularly well
set up for this, you can use a nice sturdy jack stand under each end of the
engine bearer bar, and a nice stump or log or concrete block under the
tranny giving you three support points.  That lets you suspend things off
the ground so you can get an oil drain pan under it, makes it off the ground
and easier to adjust valves, etc.  I guess you could do similar with a 1600
bus motor with the bearer bar but the bar isn't quite as nice.  As to how
long this is good for, I'd also venture split through about '83 and maybe
even the early wasserboxers, but you do have some limits.  The late 228 mm
flywheel will not fit the 002 (or earlier) bellhousings without
modifications.  And the starter changes with the 091 tranny as well, but I
think it's bellhousing and starter would still mesh with any earlier 12V
flywheel on any motor (though I won't swear on that one) perhaps making then
a '76 to '83 bellhousing and starter the optimal &quot;test stand&quot; for people
with a true smattering of buses.  And for people seeking a nice true stand
at that point, bolting the bellhousing to a regular $60 Harbor Freight (or
whoever) american style engine stand gives something sturdy and functional,
but you need to remove some of the bellhousing if you want to be able to
bolt case halves together and have acess to the gland nut/crank bolts.
