Subject: [VB] Oil leak
Message-ID: &lt;384928C0.CAEB08CC_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Did a shake down drive on the freeway this morning with a mystery motor
(1600 sp,stock everything except dog house).  Runs great, but found 3
problems.

1.  Very hard to start (cranks good) after running on freeway for 30
min.  What might be wrong?

2.  There is a significant oil leak now (after about an hour on the
freeway) out from behind the crank pulley.  Is there a seal I can
replace fairly easily, or is this a sign of a needed rebuild.  I've not
checked the Bentley, and have never rebuilt a motor.

3.   After the high speed (60 ha ha ha) run when returning to idle the
oil pressure light is flickering slightly.  After some street driving
the low pressure warning quits all together.  Another bad sign, or
related to the oil leak.

BTW, the motor runs nice and cool according to the scientific dip stick
test.

Thanks for the advice.

Steve
