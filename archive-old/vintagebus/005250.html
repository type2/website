Subject: Help ID this early ladder
Date: Fri, 4 May 2001 05:52:27 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello all.  New subscriber here. I am a bay westy owner(77 deluxe) and the
condition is incureable. I hope to own a 56-61 some day but seeing ANY split
in Indiana is like a sasquatch sighting.
Can anyone help me ID my early westy ladder. My questions are 1) is it
original and 2) what is it worth?
It folds in the center with three rungs fore and aft the hinges. It is
curved at the top to match an early bus contour and has hooks on top to
fasten to a roof rack.  It is all metal and has silver paint which appears
to be original. Four legs which meet the bus body panel have rubber feet. On
top, stamped onto each hook is a small oval circle with three letters. The
center letter is noticeably the largest and is a W. The first letter is a H.
The last letter appears to be a 5, but is somewhat corroded. HW5?
The stamps are very small and I needed a magnifying glass to get a better
view.  Thanks for any help on this.
Jay
