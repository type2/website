thanks for the tip on the thermostatic bellows... i know i do have one, is
there a way to tell if it is working properly?
I have thought about biting the bullet and installing a complete doghouse
system, i would like to do this...but i think i shold first learn how to work
on the stock, before making any modifications.
it is on my wish list. I have seen  a set up of new shroud/cooler etc all
parts needed-plus the fan shroud powder coated for around $220. does that
sound reasonable. All parts supposedly from germany...


**********
First dissconnect the thermostatic bellows from the flaps rod while the 
engine is still in the VW is the easiest way of doing this. Unless you plan 
on putting the engine on a engine stand!
While you are in there you might install the thermostatic flaps and bellow if
you do not have one, to keep your engine up to proper temp during the cooler
weather coming soon. Would also be a good idea and bite the bullet and install
a compleat doghouse cooling system
