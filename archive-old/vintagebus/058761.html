Subject:  Tranny Oil Update spec update GL5 -MT1?


Greetings All,

Been doing a bit of hunting around cos the only GL4 rated
tranny oil I could get here in Oz was a castrol 75 w 80
which seemed a bit light for the diff...

Apparently there is 'new' spec for GL5 which is GL5-MT1.
It is apparently safe for brass and 
bronze gearbox components and won't corrode them (developed for]
this reason).  Here in Oz Penrite have released a hypoid 
GL5-MT1 in a 80w90.  According to Penrite 
it  is completetly safe to use and back of 
container explicitly states 'completetly safe for brass and bronze gearbox
components'.

I'm still hunting for some tech info on the spec as opposed
to the manufacturers assurance.
