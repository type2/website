I saw the coolest flip seat westy at the VW of America show in Michigan a
few months ago.  The guy that owned it was from Toronto Canada.  This bus
was MINT!!!!  It had been in his family for something like 15
years...Immaculate.

&gt;We are compliling a registery of Flip-set buses and would love more info from 
&gt;your bus to add to this.  Also we are trying to find parts and pieces 
&gt;(Especially interior parts.) for others in the registry.  We have images of 
&gt;the interior and owners manual that we would be happy to share with anyone 
&gt;who is interested.  SO-23 is nothing like the SO-34 &amp; 35 Westie interiors.   
&gt;Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
