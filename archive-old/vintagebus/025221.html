&gt; Mine are servicable, but dirty and a bit rough.

There is a nifty product called Castrol Super Clean that does a real
number on the rubber handle covers.  Won't repair tears, but is cleanes
them up better than you would expect.

&gt; How about any
&gt; spare middle screw covers?

I have never seen replacements for these. I went searching high and low
for one about two years ago, posted to the list a couple times, and
never have seen one that wasn't part of a seat. If you find a source,
let me know!
