I'm back with more reduction box headaches. Once again on my '67 I have
torn down to the point of the big nut on the back of the output shaft -
under the freeze plug (I opted for the body dent puller method from
those preposed and it worked great - thanks Eric &amp; Barb) Anyway, I'm now
staring at a nut that looks like it had more than a few lives already
beaten out of it, evidently from someone else trying to get it off. It
has big indentations like they were beating on it from an angle with a
punch and hammer probably because they didn't have the right size
socket. There are two main grooves in opposite directions so it looks as
though they actually got it off and then they beat it back on, this
method is not working for me. I, of course, don't have the right socket
either, it's bigger than my 36mm and smaller than the axle nut (46mm?
42mm maybe) So, to the point, I hoping someone can tell me what size
socket I need to buy or perhaps an alternate method that eludes me for
removing my mangled friend.
I apprieciate the help from all of you out there in bus land.
