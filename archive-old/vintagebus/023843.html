Thanks for the information Chip!  I'll get &quot;down under&quot; today &amp; check
the shift linkage for sloppiness up front.  If the steering box problem
was just excess free play I could live with it.  This thing is actually
binding up and I'm concerned that at some point it may lock up.  When I
tried different free play adjustments, it would still bind whether
adjusted tightly or loosely.  And the box makes a clicking sound when
turning across the center position.

Thanks again, DC
