Thanks Everett,
              I guess I better start looking for the '57 and then for the 
Barndoor.  BTW I have tons of split photographs that would go nicely on you 
excellent web page.  Lots of good show splits, driver's, junked buses, 
Barndoors, a Binz, custom buses, stock buses, 30+ pictures of dealership 
frames from dealerships throughout the US etc...  Do you have a mailing 
address that I could forward the more interesting and better photo's of the 
bunch?  For some reason I just can't pin someone down to scan and email the 
pictures to you.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance from the sunshine 
state.

&gt; &gt; My first bus was a '65 then '64, then '66 then a '58, currently a '56.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;This sounds like one of those math problems, what comes next in the series
&gt;65, 64, 66, 58, 56, ...
&gt;
&gt;Well, I figured it out 2 different ways and they both came out to '57 next
&gt;so no Barndoor yet.  :)
&gt;
&gt;I'll spare you the math, someone would probably just point out a flaw.
&gt;
&gt;Wow, that was kinda geeky,
