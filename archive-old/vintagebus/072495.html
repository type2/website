Subject: Nice Panel FS. Phoenix, AZ

'61 Panel bus FS, Phoenix, AZ.
I don't know the seller, Wouldnt recognize him/her in an elevator containing
just myself and them. All I know is the bus from seeing it on regular basis
near where I used to work and at a few shows. For a &quot;custom&quot; panel this one is
dry, straight and in good shape. Chrome on the bumpers is nice. Well maintained
bus. I will put my name/reputation on this one. I am used to seeing it with
black wall tires and polished five spokes. Looks IMHO way better with that
configuration. Dont know when the change was made or if I am hallucinating
&lt;again&gt;! Maybe config was from a previous owner?
Out of all of the trash that has been offered lately. I'd say that this one can
hold its own- if it's what you are looking for. If I was in the market for a
pre-emissions panel and was not a purist, then this one would fit the bill
nicely.
Best of luck to seller and buyer.
