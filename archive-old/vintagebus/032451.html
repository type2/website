&gt;Hi Volks,

&gt;As Ken and others have now threatened me, I give up.  The bullies have won.

This is pretty sad.
What is this? A VW list? Why is it that sharing an archive is nowhere a 
problem except here?
I feel sorry for Steve to give up and think it was not necessary. His ideas 
to solve the &quot;problem&quot; are very good.
Maybe I should unsubscibe, after 5 years, on and off?
