This works, but has one minor problem.  If you have something in front
of you at night, and you need to back up, your headlights will reflect
back onto the plastic and make it effectively opaque.  Makes getting
out of my driveway kind of interesting some evenings.  It probably
wouldn't be so bad if I had backup lights, but the vehicle didn't come
with them....
