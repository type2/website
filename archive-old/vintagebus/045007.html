&lt;&lt; Is the Saphire 1 faceplate for beetles, or am I supposed to have one?  Does
 anybody have any extra post retainers?  I mean the things that go around the
 knob posts that hold the radio on place. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
For the Saffire radios the face plate for the 1955-66 buses is for bus only.
It does not cover any damage to your radio hole if there is any.  The post
retainers you are asking about are just nust and washers.  Also there is
supposed to be a strap on the forward end of the radio to the body to keep the
radio from flexing the dash board.  Eric &amp; Barb
