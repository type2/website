This weekend I had Sarah, this girl I've been going out with for a couple
of months, drive the extra bus to the RAMVA get-together and to the 'rama.
She prefers the '55 over the '60, primarily because of the steering,
which is kinda sloppy in the '60.  She also says that the '55 seems easier
to drive.  She learned to drive in a '46 willy's, she didn't have any
unrealistic expectations of comfort or power.  She also prefers the 
overstuffed seats of the '55 to the properly-stuffed seats of the '60.

She also commented on the amount of attention she got while driving
the '55 home from the 'rama.  That's funny, nobody seems to give me
the time of day when *I'm* driving it!

Oh, and she's blonde, too, although she's really a redhead.
