&lt;&lt;When you do the rust treatment (POR, Correless, etc..., TAR )&gt;&gt;
Hi Roger,
Best to remove all rust with wire wheel and Naval Jelly.  The latter we like 
to use over night with plastic wrap over it to keep it from drying out and 
allowing it to work all night long.  Continue wire wheeling, sanding, and 
acid until the rust is gone.  Then apply a coat or two of high zinc primer, 
spot puddy if needed and a couple of coats of paint over all.  Then you can 
paint the window frame and make sure to apply a bead of tar in between the 
seal and glass.  If you are worried about staining light colored paint you 
can tar the upper 1/4 of the window frame and apply the rest to the body/seal 
junction with a plastic non-twist top condiment squeeze bottle.  the bottle 
does not work well on the top due to the overhang unless you bus is a 
barndoor.

&lt;&lt;do you just do the outside or am I going to need to remove the parcel tray, 
kickkpanels and try and get the back side?&gt;&gt;
Kind of depends how bad the rust really is and you will not find out till the 
seals are out.  We know of one mid 1960s Westie from California brought up 
here that was restored completely.  Five years later it was sold to a fellow 
we know and he had the seals replaced.  Upon removing the seals he found that 
the perfect frames now had to have sections cut and welded back in to repair 
it due to not having any sealant.  You might want to do only one side at a 
time if you are doing this on a driver that you need to have driving two days 
later.  Then do the otherside next weekend.
 
&lt;&lt;My plan is remove as much rust as I can, treat the rest, fill in the holes, 
prime, rattle can paint then install my windows (all in under 5 minutes 
flat).  Any other reccomendations.  &gt;&gt;
Hope you are joking!  Best to figure that you would be lucky to get two 
windows done in a weekend.  If you are not then at least just tar the heck 
out of it and hopefully that will stop the rust.
