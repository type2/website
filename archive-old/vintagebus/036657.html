Hi JD,

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;    I was just wondering if anyone had any good suggestions 
&gt; or experience
&gt; &gt; replacing their wiring harness?

I can't remember where or when, but I saw quite a cool idea for harnesses.
It appealed to me cos I'm cheap and I like the idea of original wiring that
I can reference to Thom's fab wiring diagrams. 

This guy pulls the harness and then cuts it in two in the middle. Then joins
all the 'old' ends which would theoretically leave the 'new' ends about the
right length. Just for the hell of it I tried it out on an old beach bike
that a mate had lying about and it worked pretty well.  

I spose that it would require a harness that hadn't been completely
butchered tho.

Later 

michael
