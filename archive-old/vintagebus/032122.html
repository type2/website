&lt;&lt; I don't know how it goes.
 It is sort of Tee shaped with the tail of the Tee inclined - should it slope
 up toward the roof or down towards the ground? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Downward is how VW did it.  This prevents it from being sucked upward and 
allowing air from under the bus getting into the engine compartment.  Also 
keeps crud/sand/dust from collecting on top of this seal against the body.  
Then you have to notch it for the accelerator and choke cables.  These engine 
compartment seals are sold in a one piece for type 1s. Lay them out of the 
ground and you will see these seals are molded in a large &quot;U&quot; shape.  For the 
piece that goes over the front engine compartment arch you want to slide in 
the seal and cut off an equal amount from both ends.  Do the same with the 
seal going into the rear apron and that leaves you with four straight pieces 
of seals to go along the sides of the engine.  Eric&amp;Barb
