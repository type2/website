Yes, the torque is probably different, seeing as how they use small studs.
I don't know the value though.  The difference in size between my original
engine and the Mexican engine is rather dramatic!

Be sure that you have the correct value before proceeding!

&gt;   I thought i had read that the amount of torgue differed from that of the 
&gt; original engines, which were torqued to just over 20 ft lbs. Could someone 
&gt; let me know what the torque value should be.
