Subject: Junk Vehicle Law

New York State law forbids the possession
of one (1) or more motor vehicles which are
unlicensed, unregistered, or uninsured or
any combination thereof.
These are considered &quot;junk&quot; regardless of the fact
that they have a value in excess of scrap metal.
The same law forbids possession of parts or
materials stored in open areas of premises.
Some communities have taken this a step further,
to include legal vehicles ( properly lisenced, registered
and insured ) temporarily disabled at a residence.
This would include a vehicle on jack stands for the
purpose of changing a tire.

Exceptions include vehicles displayed at licensed
repair shops for the purpose of repair or liscensed
dealer or wholesaler lots for the purpose of sale.
Lisenced junk yards are also exempt.
Also exempted are those vehicles stored in a building.
Car covers and tarps do not satisfy this exemption.

There are no legal collectors of vehicles
who do not satisfy these regulations.

According to New York State Executive Law
section 382(2) you can be fined up to $1000
per violation per day and imprisoned up to
1 year or both.

I am currently considering my options
regarding &quot;alledged&quot; violations of this law,
both to satisfy the authorities and to allow for
the continuation of my activities.

Any advice will be appreciated.
