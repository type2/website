&gt; Before you drive too far, check the check-valve in your carbs. Your electric
&gt; fuel pump should STOP when the carb float(s) are full. 



The valve works in my carb. But I believe the pump keeps going, just can't (or
isn't supposed to) get the fuel into the carb. I could be wrong.

I think I'm ready to try a different electric fuel pump. Is there something
good out there I can use on my VW? Something that puts out the correct fuel
pressure? Something that won't end up flooding or tearing up my engine?

I've got a fuel regulator valve in line after the fuel pump. It seems to help.
But I'd rather have a fuel pump that I can feel comfertable with.

Suggestions?
