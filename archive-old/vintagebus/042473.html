&gt; there's an &quot;NOS&quot; split bus locking gas cap on ebay.  My hunch,
&gt; based on the design of the stamping and the cadmium plating, is that this

&gt; elsewhere for much less.  I've seen a few of these up for auction now.
Hi all,

I am going to make everyones week here i think...

If you want a New (not old stock, new) locking gas cap for your 55-67 bus
for $9.99 i can tell you where to get such a thing...

Autozone.

Its in stock at the one near me, on the shelf, i even touched it.  I have
an original locking gas cap as well, and this one looks to be made more or
less the same, just the &quot;cap&quot; portion on the old school one is nicer by a
fair shake. (cast part with a domed shape, pebbled texture, grippers
around the edge, chromed.  New one a piece of chromed stamped sheetmetal, 
if you take off the fugly red warning sticker and polish a tad, it'll look 
Way Kewl)

Big gotcha.... My old school one is vented, the one at auto-zone isnt.
I've been meaning to take apart an autozone one and my vented one to
figure out where to drill to make em act the same, and then post
instructions on venting and where to get the cap all at once, but since it
came up i am going to jump the gun and let you all know the where now.
(ive been too busy getting my 61 running to worry about someone stealing
gas out of its empty tank, har)

hope this helps,

Steve

p.s. i can see the autozone main computer showing a nationwide run on
these things later today, hehehe.  Guys going in and saying ill take 10
(to sell on e-bay as NOS for $50 of course.)
