&lt;&lt; Very true. To each his (or her) own. But, if some people want to be judged
 by a points book...I say why not? If you've seen any of my buses you know
 this is definitely not self-serving. I can't imagine the Zebra bus placing
 high in any points-based judging. But...I don't think it would hurt
 anything. I think that the VW bus hobby would always have non-concours
 events and classes too and that the two could get along just fine. &gt;&gt;

How will you judge buses that came from the factory not painted, and the 
customer painted it after receiving it? I know that some buses from old 
photos I have, have been painted zebra striped for there use in the plains of 
Africa.
