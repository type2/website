 &gt;Just rember to set a price limit for yourself and you will not regret your
 &gt;purchace.
 
 Well put.
 
 It's too easy to get caught up in the lust for a treasure, like a set of
 NOS early bus taillights.  One NOS set went for $250 (my last-second
 strategy backfired when I miss-clicked!) and then a USED set from the same
 guy went for $385 the next week!

Hey Thom, I just can't believe the Bus tail light story. Do you know the
auction numbers of those items? If this is true then I'll start selling used
Super Beetle gas caps for $200.00 a whack. 
If these tail lights were Barndoor that might explain some of it.
Let us know
Kerry
