Subject: Identify that seat

Hey anybody interested.  I have had a seat in my 65 microbus since I
bought it that the PO said was not the right one.  I took some picitures
here:

And I wondered if anyone might hazzard a guess as to what this rear seat
is from.  It has cream vinyl with a black fuzzy back.  It appears to
fold forward and has some brackets and hardware for that.  The back is
heavy and solid!  Appears to be the same size as the back seat I found
in a 67 Deluxe a couple months back, so I don't think its a late model
seat.

Any ideas out there?

Thanks in advance,

Chris
