Subject: My one week resto

Well I guess it is finally time to describe my &quot;one-week&quot; resto of my 21
window bus &quot;clementine&quot; (sorry about the liberal use of quotation
marks).
   As some of you know I'm a school teacher and during my spring break I
decided to restore my bus.  First off my advice is don't try this at
home people, it took at least 5 years off my life.
    It all starts with me and my 6 year old son, Rowan, driving down to
Memaw and Papa's house to park in papa's shop for a week.  Rowan had
decided that he could be of some assistance during the work.  The shop
has everything a 35 year old bus could want, grinders, plasma cutters,
mig welder, arc welder, industrial air compressor, several DA's (for
sanding), lots of light, lots of tools, and lots of space.  It also
incidently had my dad and brother, both of whom know how to use this
equipment far better than I.  Saturday I arrived around lunchtime, and
before dinner she was stripped down like a drunk prom queen, or for
those of you with teenage daughter's that are getting ready for prom as
we speak, then she was stripped down like she was left in the bario,
which of course offends an entirely different audience, sorry.  Anyway,
by Sunday we realized that my girl had some rust issues, and would need
a rather large graft of skin.  Not a problem when you have a junkyard of
Ford's on the back forty and a plasma cutter.  Also I do not know what
kind of paint was used before but it was very hard to cut, my guess is
that it was tractor paint.  By Thursday the primer was done, Friday saw
the addition of pearl white to the top, and Saturday saw the addition of
Platinum silver to the bottom.  I had no idea paint was as expensive as
it is, but at least she is not covered in trator paint anymore.  I do
have some pictures, but since my new interior panels and CE safari's
have yet to arrive I have not posted the entire pictorial on thesamba.
I wanted to post all at once, so hopefully soon.
   As a side note my eurocamper arrived that week as well, an Eriba
triton.  I need to change the wiring over so if anyone has any
experience with a project like that please let me know any pointers you
might have.
    I have to go I hear sick kids coughing and mom's out with the hen's
                Tim Johnson
                 and his trusty 67, clementine.
