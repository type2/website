I went on a trip from San Jose to Los Angeles last week on Southwest Airlines.
They had a hazardous materials pamphlet by the gate, and I looked inside, Lo 
and behold there was a splittie!
It seems that split window buses are the thing for advertising.
Here is the literature and the spray painted bus.
Does anyone know whose bus it is, and has the spray paint come off?
