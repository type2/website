Sam writ:
&gt;But the question is, Some people say that 3500 RPM is a good Max
 I infer from the book that 4000 RPM is Max 
Others have said that 4500 RPM is Max &lt;

Depends on the engine...

If your engine is running a C/W crank and is somewhat balanced I believe it
is good for 5000RPM very easily...  Usually the little carb will stifle the
party before then so it would be running out of breath.  If you run a
non-stock setup it is easy to see 5K though.

If you are running stock I would limit the party at 4000RPM.  Any faster
than that and the crank forces get too high.

Here is the catch though...  How hot would you be running if you cruised at
4500 RPM?  From my experience it is best to stay closer to 3500 so that the
motor stays cool.  This of course depends highly on how your engine runs and
you might do better than me at keeping a cool engine.  I do not like to get
the oil over 230 degrees.

This is a heavy YMMV post.
