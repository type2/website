get's very hot, the big red wire (30?) get too hot to touch at the light 
switch end.  Somebody told me I probably have resistance in the switch 
itself.  Has anyone out there ever done a relay bypass for there light 
switch?  I have the idea to run new wires for my headlamps and have the power 
go through a realy rather than the 35 y/o light switch.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Whoa!  First see if you can fix the switch.  We had this same problem in our 
1960 panel camper conversion.  This seems to be doubly needed in the pre-1961 
slip on connections buses due to a weaker system of riveting.  Remove the two 
rivets that hold the rear (FIF!) cover of the switch, but make sure the dash 
knob shaft stays in the forward section of the switch as you do this.  Then 
mark the position of this shaft in the inside of the forward section of the 
switch.  Otherwise you will have to figure out which one of four positions it 
was suppsed to be in when you put it back together.  Then remove the shaft, 
clean all the contact surfaces, and solder all the riveted connections inside 
of the switch.  Replce the rivets with small diameter screws and nuts (You 
probably will have to sand/file one side of the nuts flat to get them to fit 
against the body of the switch.), and reinstall.
  Doing all of this turned our hot running switch into a very cool one and 
increased power to not only the head lights, but to all the other lights 
controlled by the switch, and even to the ignition switch!  Just remember to 
remove one of the battery cables to prevent an electrical fire while you are 
working.          Eric&amp;Barb
