&lt;&lt;  I'm tired of seeing 
  &quot;show winning&quot; cars which are basically just a bunch of chrome goodies
  and cheesy display props. &gt;&gt;


When I was helping Dennis rose back in the 80s at car shows we won all the 
time, normally best of show........

with what ?

the &quot;Krankenwagen&quot; yes with a chessy crash display etc.......

Hell no it was not stock.....but it sure was FUN

did we forget that little word &quot;FUN&quot;

I stopped helping him when winning the trophy became more important to him 
then just showing up and putting on show......

shows will never be fair,  local judges are one thing , but really there are 
lots of nice cars at a big show, maybe 5-10 are first place quality, but 
there is only one trophy.....

so people go away pissed........

the death of California car shows was Chris Addingtons Ghia, money was no 
object , once he started showing it in VW only shows there was no way to 
win.......

maybe you saw it for sale in the back of Hot VW for $300,000 (thats not a 
misprint)

the best sign......

Display only, please do not judge...........
