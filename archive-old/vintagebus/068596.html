Subject: Re: [VB] hangin a rear bumper

Tom,

At the risk of seisure by the rest of the vintage nazis here (myself
included), I never have had the end attachment points in operation. Just
the two brackets (total 4 bolts there). Unless you need total accuracy,
the brackets are easier to deal with, and the end points aren't going to
anyplace secure anyway. Plus the those bumper plates are rare,
yaddayadda... To me, the bumper is just for looks anyway! What's it gonna
protect? ;-)
