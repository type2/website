&gt; &gt;&gt;Sounds to me like a fuel delivery problem, actually.
&gt;  
&gt;  I really wonder if it is a fuel delivery problem.  When I could not get it 
&gt;  started in the parking lot I did try starter fluid.  The bus did not even 
&gt;  have an inclination of firing.  Just spun via the starter.  The starting 
&gt;  fluid should have bypassed any carb/fuel issues and at least had it fire.  
&gt;  Right?
&gt;  
sounds like you need to do a proper diagnosis, step by step till you find the 
problem.  You found there was electricity to the coil, now take it from 
there....  

eg take dist cap off, leave ig on, turn engine round by hand- is there a 
spark at the points?

ig off, remove fuel line at carb, point it away from you, turn motor over by 
hand (or by friend with key, but disconnect wire to center of dist first, and 
point it away from any wires)- watch the fuel come out of the line.

etc, etc
