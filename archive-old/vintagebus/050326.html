 &gt;congrats on the new bus!    Now --- why change it?   Why fix what ain't
&gt;broke?   Enjoy the bus a bit before getting dirty- surely it will need work
&gt;later.

I agree with this 100%!! I wish I would have just drove my '59 around for a
while and enjoyed it rather than rushing into &quot;restoring&quot; it. Drive it for
a while and have fun. You may decide you don't want to change a thing!
