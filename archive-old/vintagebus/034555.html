&lt;&lt;  It's 4-track alright. It looks just like a saphire radio. I'll take a 
picture 
 of it this week and stick it on my website. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rick,
Thanks, that would be very interesting to see.  A friend of our who nows that 
we like wierd and normal VW type of radios found us our Playtape indash 
player by Saffire including some tapes!  Has anyone found any more of these 
tapes?  Does anyone have an idea about year these or the 4-track were 
produced?

&lt;&lt;He also said that a guy came by his shop and saw a 4-track player and asked 
what it was. He told him about it and this guy says. &quot;Man, I wish I'd have 
come over 2 weeks ago. I just threw away a punch of those tapes&quot;. He even had 
a 4-track recorder set up to copy stuff.  They wouldn't fit in his old 
8-track so he pitched them. Bummer.&gt;&gt;
Yes, that is the American way!  If you do not have a use for it just throw it 
away!  We have heard this all too often in our search for vintage VW 
parts.....  Eric&amp;Barb
