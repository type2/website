Had the skylights sitting on the passenger seat during the tear down of my  '65 21w that I started a week ago. Got to the bulkhead panels, drilling out the rivets. Gotta get this cleared out for the trip to the body man. Ahh, grab handle needs unbolting. Grab the Rost-Off and push the seat forward to spray the nuts, CRASH. Bad word, BAD WORD! All 8 hit the floor with various tools and junk but no damage done. Must be living right. Lesson? If you're pulling stuff off a bus, don't leave it in the bus. And take your time. 
Karl tipped me off to a early bay with enough wide 5 wheels &amp; tires to replace the narrow bug/porsche wheels on the '66 camper. Junkyard hadn't put it on the stands yet, so I loosened all the lug nuts and grabbed the spare.  Noticed a ZVW procedure to add a flasher for trailer duty. Anybody interested? Will grab the docs and relay tomorrow after work.
