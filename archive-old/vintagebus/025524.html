Subject: woo woo  I'm famous/ NEATO OBR
Message-ID: &lt;3765A8CA.74A8_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

Got my OBR in the mail today, and to my suprise, Dave E had put the
first installment of the Mexico trip report in there. So for those of
you who haven't checked it out on the webpage, you should definitely
check the latest NEATO newsletter. 
BTW, lots of good trip reports go up on the list, and could also be
mailed to NEATO. I know Dave is working hard to get up to date on the
OBR, and one thing he needs is submissions. 
What?  You aren't a member of NEATO? I can tell you it is well worth the
small membership dues. Check

 http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html 

for membership info! You will be glad you did! Remember, NEATO is the
split bus club that actually has functions, elects officials and board
members, and puts out a newsletter by and for split enthusiasts.
