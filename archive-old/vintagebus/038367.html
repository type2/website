Subject: 23 window project report, Seattle for sale

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In the spirt of bus hunting, I was the first to look at a '61 23-Window
Deluxe that went for sale in the Seattle Times.

It is about 10 minutes from my house, I am more than willing to help others
with a long-distance deal.

Here is my report.

1) Advertisement:  '61 - Deluxe 23-window bus. $3250/obo. (425) 204-5562

2) Visit: Really nice couple that has some money.  Professional people, live
on Lake Washington (across the street from it) and had a mint 55 bug in the
driveway.  Also has a 13 window project, which is why he is selling this
23-Window -- as he realizes he doesn't have time to finish both.  He also
had a '63 Double Cab (more later).

3) Project:  This 23 window Deluxe has everything you could unbolt remove!
Every piece of glass, every trim, every panel, everything interior and
exterior. This thing is bare.

He says all the glass is there, has the seats -- INCLUDING the split middle
seat -- says the jailbars are there.  Had trim neatly organized in pile and
it looked good.

BODY:  I thought the body was in really good shape.  With EVERYTHING
removed, you could see that this was a very straight bus.  There were some
quarter size holes in floor under the front seat floors (between seat and
pedals).  ALso behind passenger seat &quot;divider&quot; it had some metal work on the
divider where it meets the floor -- he pointed it out to me -- didn't look
bad at all.  Window frames seemed solid and only pitted in areas.  Corners
all looked good.

4)  Engine and tranny:  Tranny still installed, looked original era to me --
but I wouldn't really know.  Had a 1600DP longblock sitting inside the
bus... he said it goes with it (and implied it was a good engine, not
trashed).  Had a set of brand-new (NOS?) looking heat exchangers on
passenger front seat that he said go with it.  So obviously no original
engine with it...

4) Price.  Story is he purchased it with dreams of doing a 23-window after
his 13-window and hasn't touched it.  Says he got it in the condition it is
and has merely collected some of the parts (middle split seat and so forth).
So I suspect he is selling only slightly more than what he put into it.

 ===== overall report ======

As I understand it, these things are getting rare.  If someone wants a
already stripped clean body in a million parts -- this is a very solid bus
and you can see it down to the metal in all places.

This hit the Seattle time this morning, I was the only one to see it last
night.... so it is out there!

P.S.  Although I didn't know until I arrived, in his garage next to this 23
window was the most perfect Double Cab I have ever seen.  A '63, just like
the one (but in 99% condition) that Jeff Schwaia's had for sale that was
pulled from the market.  As this guy clearly understood the value of his
VW's, I didn't even ask what it was worth -- I figured at least $15,000 as
this things was perfect...  Boo hoo, the irony.  I couldn't keep my eyes off
it, I was trying not to freak him out -- but I had to admire.
