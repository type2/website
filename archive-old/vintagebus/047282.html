Theres a guy out in the CA. desert claiming he has a 59 panel with a DOUBLE 
swivel seat.
(Drivers AND passengers)
Ive never seen or knew such a beast existed.
He claimes its the real deal. Thoughts?
I havent wanted to go look.
As far as 99% panels. Hmmmm
Theres a kombi that got butchered in AZ. last year, and Jonny Jimenez out 
here in so cal. has a NICE 59 kombi SS. 
99%, I cant count 200 SS panels that exist. ;-)
Yes, 700$, Yes, Insane. But dont forget theres a second bidder on that whos 
just as insane!

Here's what I know:
It's a real thing.  Usually for Panels (99%), it was installed on 
walkthroughs that had a cut-down walkthrough portion.  There was no passenger 
seat so the Bus was a 1-seater.

It's up to $666 or so?  That is insane, a buddy of mine had one unupholstered 
for about $150 a year ago, it was tough to sell.  I wonder if he still has 
it...
