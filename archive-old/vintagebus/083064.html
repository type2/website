Subject: Belt slippage.

George and anyone else,

I was trying to come up with a way to test for belt slippage short of taking
a direct rpm reading of both the crank pulley and the alternator pulley as
rpm is increased, and then taking the data and checking the speed ratio of
the two. Since I haven't any other instrumentation, maybe there is a way by
using a timing light and placing a mark on the alternator pulley and looking
at how the mark either advances or retards. The advance or retard should be
consistent spacialy if the pulley is not slipping, that is the change in
position of the mark should be constant if the belt is not slipping. For
example, the mark on the alternator pulley may move a 1/4 turn ahead for
each revolution of the drive pulley and if slipping it would move a
different increment. Hmmm things may move too fast to really see what is
going on at 3-4000 rpm.

Any thoughts? It might work. I will try it some time and give feedback.

This test may be best performed at night when the strobe is not washed out
by daylight.

Chris
