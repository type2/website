&lt;&lt; What's the worse that could happen to the engine if I try unlead fuel 
(Could
 it break totally down) ?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Lars,
If you do not lug the engine and it does not ping (Detonation) with that 
special death rattle then it is fine.  If you often get pinging especially 
going uphill it would be a good idea to install shims and drop the 
compression ratio to prevent blowing a hole through one of the pistons.
