Hi All..

I've been enjoying driving my
fresh-out-of-the-paint-booth-but-waiting-for-a-respray '66 Westy since last
week, and a couple days ago, I noticed an obnoxious rattle when I dropped
the engine to low rpm's from high when it was warming up.  This sound
persisted at low rpm, and was accentuated by revving up to 1500 rpm or so
and then throttling back.

The sound seems to go away once the motor is fully warmed up.

Am I losing a rod bearing?  The crankshaft pulley pull test is good, and
turning the engine by hand yields no info.  The sound persists when the
fanbelt is removed.  Valves are adjusted, and all other tune-up stuff is
done *perfectly*.

I have checked out the Muir sounds again, and still cannot decide what is
up.  Oh yes....this engine is the one that was in the bus when we bought it.
A 1600 single-port.  The PO said that he had taken it (from bay area, CA) to
Washington twice, and Arizona once.....and that &quot;it cruises 70 no problem&quot;.
Yikes.

Should I step up my schedule to put my other (new) engine in?

Thanks..

Gene
