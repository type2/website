Subject: Re: [VB] whats a binz? (value)
To: ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

there was a 58 or so Binz at vintage meet 4 or 5 years ago.  On a trailer.  
For sale    unrestored project. Looked do able.  First I had seen one.   
What's a Binz?  I said.  Early pre production double cab, Binz company made 
the regular trucks into crew cabs.   Look, funny window.  etc.    I think 
that truck was for sale for $1500  and no one bought it.

 &lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; whats a binz, like the history of, etc.
  
  Well, recently it seem to be a VERY overpriced VW truck! &gt;&gt;
 
 I don't think so.  Of course I could be totally wrong but I think the Binz 
is 
 actually undervalued right now.  
 
 Bottom line on &quot;value&quot; is supply and demand.  The supply of Binz is 
 incredibly low.  After looking for 3 years I have found only 12 Binz and 
some 
 of those are in junkyards.  I would bet there are fewer Binz out there than 
 there are Hebmeullers.  We all know that busses are *way* cooler than bugs 
 (even if it is a Heb) so then why isn't the Binz price equal to the Heb?  
 Because *right now* there is a lack of demand for the Binz.
