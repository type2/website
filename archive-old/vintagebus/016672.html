Ay, there's the rub.  It's like playing the stock market.
People buy the trendy internet stocks that have no earnings because 
that's what you're &quot;supposed&quot; to buy.  Old-School blue-chip stocks are
out of favor, even though the companies have performed admirably
for *decades*.

As in my message Friday, there's a distinction to be made between
doing it as a hobby and doing it to put bread on the table.
As the interest in VW's increases, prices go up, and more
speculators move in.

The flak RVB is getting is from people applying the speculative
template to an enthusiast bus and it's sale.  They apply the criteria
that speculators use in assessing a bus, and it comes up short.
Unfortunately, there is no way to adapt their metrics (ie paint,
originality, accessories) to his bus.

Asking prices of buses have gone up across the board for all models,
athough it seems to be just the deluxes that are finding willing
buyers at those prices.  Other models have appreciated on their
coattails, but not nearly to the same degree.  If one
internet stock goes up significantly, the others tend to as well,
for reasons I can't fathom.

Unfortunatly for RVB, the high-dollar speculators want 60's
deluxes that they can turn within a day or two.  They have no
intention of actually driving the things.  Much less camping in them.
That '60 deluxe could have had a thrown rod and it prolly wouldn't have 
made a difference in the price.  Big Blue in a Yahoo_dot_com market.

How about each listmember kicks down $25 and buys the bus. We could
hand it off from show to show like that hubcap.  There's approximately
500 list members; if everyone kicked in, that would be $12.5k
