Yha,

I just learned this one trying to replace my generator.  I'm not even 1/2
way done and I should have just pulled the engine.  The Archives told me, I
didn't listen &lt;grin&gt;.

Ed O'Donnel sez, and I've learned this to be oh so true: &quot;The more shortcuts
you take to save time, the more time you will waste until you do it right.&quot;
Just pull the motor.  It's such a cake walk on a split anyway.  Sometimes I
pull my motor just for the hell of it.  In and out in an hour, wow!
Couldn't do that on my old 75.
