I have that book, and did see the SO-1 brochure. I would ask Rich in Fres=
no, but he seems to be a bit unhappy that his isn't the only one around, =
and was less than eager to talk about it at Pomona. There is another one =
in the PNW, but it has a slider instead of cargo doors.

&gt;What I got is a '59 LH cargo door Panel with a Westy SO-1 (sales flap)
&gt;conversion.

Very cool!

&gt;I have pictures of what the interior *should* look like, but this one
&gt;is gutted, so now I'm on a mission for *any* info, pictures, pieces, etc=
.

If you have the book &quot;VW Bus, The First 50 Years&quot; by Keith Seume there
are some good pictures on pages 23-25.  One of them is the front of a
Westy SO-1 brochure, so you might ask around among the literature
collectors.

Good luck!
