Hi Gerald,
The first thing to do is buy or borrow a tach for 15 minute drive and see
where 1,500 &amp; 3,000RPM are in all four forward gears at what MPH.  You
probably have a stock geared tranny that does 3,000RPM at or below 50 MPH.  We
have info on modifying the stock tranny keeping the reduction boxes and being
able to do 60+MPH in fourth at 3,000RPM.  We are running this setup in our
panel with a 1641cc dual relief case and single port heads with a type 4
cooler(40% bigger than stock dog house cooler.) in the doghouse fan shroud.
We recently went from Olympia Wash to Sacramento back to Seattle at 63-65MPH
getting 24 MPG average and the highest temp was 205 F while the temps were in
the low 80s.    Eric &amp; Barb
