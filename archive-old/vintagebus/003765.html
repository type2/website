back in my days of restoring 356 porsche's (1979-90)
we used walnut or plastic medias to blast the bodys
undercarriage etc. the problem with all other medias ie; sand, pumus, copper
slag (yes some blasters use this because it's cheap) is not warping the
steel as mush as tempering it which makes it hard to work, a good blaster
can operater can regulate the pressure to prevent warpage, in the early days
vw and porsche the metal has a memory which
helps it retain its shape even after straitening, i have pulled
poped and taped dents out of buses that went back to the original shape.

the problem with blasting is the resdiual it gets in everything and is
almost impossable to get completely cleaned out.
when porsche and vw designers devised these vehicals
they weren't thinking of longivity, porsche had even worse
rusting problems then vw's which are a piece of cake compaired to the 356,
that's one of the reasons i got out of porsche business (still have a couple
cars and a sh#t load of parts for these, but the buses are more fun, cheaper
to do and now i've got the good sheet metal to use, that fits

a short story: blew the heater chanels out of a 356 that was walnut blasted
while welding on some pieces, the heat
exploded the walnut dust and it acted like a cannon

so went to chemical stripping and spot blasting the rust
then useing MIRACHEM 250 on surface rust and to protect
bare metal, this is an awesome product made in az in tempe

just my 3 bits
