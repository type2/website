Subject: Everything I know about my tranny

I hate to keep beating a dead horse .. but here is another email about my
tranny .. clutch .. thunk and grind ..

A quick note before I start:  Stopped at the mechanics from hell yesterday,
he, the father, wanted to talk to me about my bus, my complaints .. etc etc ..
Basically I told him about the &quot;thunk&quot; .. let him hear it .. told him I
thought it was a mount . told him it is leaking oil where the tranny and case
come together .. he said &quot;dammit, hope it isn't another cracked case.&quot;

I walked to the store while he and his monkeys looked at the bus, listened to
the thunk .. don't think they even examined the oil leak.

When I came back he told me it isn't a broken mount, don't ask how he knew or
why he said that .. It was gibberish .. what he said was he thought it was in
the axel .. I think he said &quot;tulip&quot; or some flower .. came apart or ???

Tried to research it . .found nothing on the web or in my idiot book .. I
think he is full of S --- but then .. I should &quot;stick to computers and he will
stick to mechanics.&quot;   That is an OLD quote from him.

Here are the events as I remember them.  I will go back later and look at my
notes for dates .. but .....

1)  Had to push the clutch ALL THE WAY to the floor in the beginning to
release the clutch or engage the clutch or what ever ... In doing that .. the
metal would rub on metal VERY CLOSE to the floor .. a HORRIBLE sound.  At that
time there was NO &quot;thunk&quot; noise.

2)  Son # 2 went under the bus and adjusted the clutch so it didn't need to
reach the floor to shift.  Thinking back, I have to wonder if he did something
to screw up the cable, because next visit there they installed a new clutch
cable ..

3)  After the clutch adjustment, I can't remember which came first the &quot;clunk&quot;
or the whirrrrr of the throw out bearing .. almost at the same time.

4)  Clutch cable replaced at the same time as the throw out bearing at the
same time as they pulled the engine and discovered the crack in the case.  My
thought from that moment on was there was a broken mount and the tranny
banging on the case cracked it.  But then, would the mount crack during clutch
adjustment ?? Just a thought .. I am clueless.

5)  I can duplicate the thunk by tapping the gas pedal .. or releasing the
clutch too fast .. never hear a thunk when I hit a bump in the road .. should
I if a mount is broken ?? I remain clueless .. AGAIN ...

6)  If they didn't pull the engine out .. can they really tell if a mount is
broken ?? Also he said he SUSPECTS this &quot;tulip&quot; thing .. &quot;his friend the
tranny guy agrees.... &quot; yadda yadda ...

ANOTHER THING to take into consideration ..

7)  When I am driving I NEVER pop out of gear .. the shifter doesn't move ..
BUT .. When I am in reverse - back up - then put it in 1st .. most of the time
it POPS out of reverse .. sometimes it doesn't .. sometimes it just slides out
and slides easily into first .. ALSO .. when this happens, the NO POPPING out
of reverse, the shifting seems much smoother .. and no grinding .. I won't
swear to it .. but I don't think I hear the thunk noise .. so don't use that
in this logic problem .. but it shifts smooth through 4th .. and eventually
goes back to the grindy shifting thing ..

8)  LAST .. seems I have to press the clutch closer and closer each day to the
floor to shift without grinding .. and yet, going ALL THE WAY to the floor no
longer makes the metal on metal sound ...

I love listening to the logic from this group .. I believe what you all say
more than any mechanic in town that is trying to get into my wallet ...
