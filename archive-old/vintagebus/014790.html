hey all,
i just wanted to lament to my air cooled friends that i will be relieving 
the world of another splittie. she is my German S0-44 westy that is too gone 
to save. bad nose, bad frame, cut dash, not one straight panel or corner. 
(no, the interior is not for sale) i am going to make a piece of wall art 
out of the front two feet. its too bad, i did a lot of work to her too, 
re-wired her all up, sanded and paintd from the beltline up, top end 
rebuild, tie rods.... anyway, i wanted to know where to start and how to 
tear through her. also, i am going to cut her pop-top off and slap it in my 
hard top westy. can anyone help here? anyone need a front bench frame?
thanks,
Bob Margiotti
