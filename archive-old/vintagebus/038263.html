That little VW RV that is been for sale for quite a bit
(http://hometown.aol_dot_com/disconcerter/65rv.html) 
,
i think it could interest mostly people from remote area as YUKON where
lodging is expensive and difficult !!  

Yukon is still a wild country where campin everywhere in youre Vw (westfalia
or other) you are sure nobody will come bother you only bears!! 

Its one of the last place on earth still wild and quiet!!
