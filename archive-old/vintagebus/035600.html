Subject: Re: [VB] An annoying rattle and a SECOND clutch cable break
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 
 ... I recently replaced the clutch cable in my 65.   since then my clutch feels really messed up, (yes I did readjust it to compensate for stretch) not directly after but a couple weeks later I went over some really bad roads and the the clutch felt all grabby and jumpy.  
 
  Looking underneath I noticed the place where the bowden tube for the clutch cable attaches to the body has come loose from the body, so the rear end of the metal tube which is attached to the rear end of the metal throttle cable tube is hanging there, as it has not yet been rewelded.   No funny noises banging around, but I suggest you look at this area and your bowden tube.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The only way to describe the sound would be like a loose clamp rattling
&gt; &gt; &gt;  around on a steel beam.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm...  A couple of guesses would be a loose or broken tranny mount, and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; shift linkage that needs new bushings, and tube seals or possibly a worn out 
&gt; &gt; &gt; shock rubber grommet.   Eric&amp;Barb
