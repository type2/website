Subject: That battery stuff.(Eric&amp;Barb)

I hate to contradict you since your knowledge runs way deeper than my own
BUT, you can start a cold VW in extreme cold with a 12 volt battery. I
lived in Vail CO for a winter and my 66 bus started every time. This was
even with 90 weight gear oil in the gear box (big mistake for real cold).
The first month we were there it only climbed up to 0 a few times the whole
month and was quite often 10-15 below. I was using a new Die Hard with 850
cold cranking amps. It worked great, you couldn't shift for about 3 blocks
when the gear oil would liquify again but other than that all was well. I
drive all of my VW's skiing and regularly start them all at temps in the 15
to 30 range without any problems.
hope this helps someone,
Craig

ps - I like that trivia bit about the battery cables. I did not know that
one. I have seen the dual generators but not the dual battery cables.
