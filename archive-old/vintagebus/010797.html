On Thu, 9 Jul 1998, Todd asked:

&gt;BTW I need an oil bypass valve for my external oil cooler...where
should I
&gt;look?

Todd,

The cooler kit I got had the cooler, electric fan, thermo switch,
bypass, etc as one kit from Bernie Bergman. He sells the pieces (I
think). I was looking in a Bugpack catalog that I happened to have here
and they sell one (P/N 3061 on pg. 29 of catalog #21). They also carry
the cooler and electric fan setup (P/N 3000-10) I just replaced my fan
with a 10&quot; auxiliary one from Pep Boys. I've had the system for about 5
years now and the fan seems to take a beating in the location that I
have it and the cooler installed (just forward of the r/h rear jack boss
in the cavity under the van. There are photos on my web site for the
curious.) 


Good running,


Scott
