 I just bought a rebuit box from Wolfgang and they want me to do
something I never thought of....
They say to mix 3 parts 90 wt and 1 part moly grease and squirt the brew
into the box. They say that straight 90 will run out ( and it does on my
old one) and straight moly will not get to the worm and peg.
They also say to use &quot;powerpunch&quot; brand as the 90wt. 
I always avoid snake oils, but they are warrrantying it , and when ever
I talk to them on the phone they seem to know their stuff. Their king
and link spindles sure are nice....

Thoughts? Eric and Barb?
