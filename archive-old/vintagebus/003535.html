I am re-sending this post as it was originally sent while
the server was down. Maybe a few of you didn't receive it.

 Hi,

   I finally found a blaster that does automobiles and sound
 like it is a large part of his business. He spent about 5
 minutes talking when I called. Said he had 4 cars in his
 yard ready to blast. He uses plastic media. Sounded
 experienced.  The guy's name is Derrick. I will be taking a
 trip out to take a look sometime next month. I will post
 more feedback then.

 Blast Tech

 Anyone on the list used his services? Got any feedback?

 Chris
