&gt;Amanda,
&gt;
&gt;Today is your lucky day! Dawn from PLF just posted that she is reproducing
&gt;Sundial tents as well as the poles!!!! Check it out at www.plfvw_dot_com .


  Does the tent slide through a runner
&gt;&gt;above the cargo doors?  Big tent...takes up a whole 'nother parking place
&gt;&gt;next to the bus with 3 sides that zip together and completely enclose???
I
&gt;&gt;am missing the original poles fo my tent...pvc sucks!  I hate to
&gt;&gt;canabalize....but if the owner would be willing to part with the poles
&gt;alone
&gt;&gt;you could make me a very happy woman!   I hope you would find out for me
&gt;and
&gt;&gt;let me know...I would REEEEAAALLY appreciate it.  Or if anyone else knows
&gt;&gt;where I could  get those poles I would really appreciate the info.  Thanx!



I looked at the website...and unfortunately, it is not my tent...thanks for
the thought though....but I don't have a common tent...I think I've olny
seen one other like it.  And the camper you've described sounds like it just
might have the same tent &lt;LOTS of poles&gt;...it is a very large tent...and
it's rarety is why I don't already have a set....so once again, if anyone
knows of poles for the type of tent I described.....PLEASE let me know.
Thanks.
