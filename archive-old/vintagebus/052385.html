&gt; No, the speedo is direct drive off of the cable input.  The odometer runs
&gt; off of a worm gear from this.  I think that the noise is more likely
&gt; because of binding in the bushings.  If the gears are gone, the problem is
&gt; worse!
&gt; 

Yep, I phrased that wrong, I meant to say odometer. As for bushing wear for 
the drive cups.  It would take a tremendous amount of wear to change the 
distance between magnet and cup (a distance of about .020)  There is also the 
centering pin in the aluminum cap that sets in the magnet to keep things 
straight and true.  As for glitches, the odometer gears take their power from 
the magnet side/cable side of the speedo, opposite the needle cup.  Hence if 
the odometer shafts and gears bind it causes a momentary needle flutter. This 
is caused by shafts wearing into the housing.  The gears themselves are made 
of brass and steel and I don't think I've ever seen any strip unless there 
was total lock up.  And unlike the later Bay window speedos, the Splitties 
have an adjustment for the odometer drive.  This adjustment was originally 
for setting the back lash of the two middle odometer gears, but it can also 
be used to take some of the play out of them.  Thus keeping the worm drive 
for the odometer from skipping on the gear for the numbers which glitches the 
magnetic drive a hair.   I have rarely seen the cup and magnet fail, usally 9 
out of 10 speedo failures (not counting cable failures) is due to the 
odometer system in the speedo and the number one cause for this is lack of 
lubercation.
