Subject: more jetting questions :)


Posted this to Barb&amp;Eric, but thought I'd throw it open to the list...




Hello - I have temporarily ditched my 30/31... it got 15 mph on a recent
highway run, no stumbles, engine barely even got  warm to the touch! Which
I knew meant too much fuel blowing through it. (125, 130z, 65 and g65
jets). So, I'm saving it as a backup for my trip this weekend, and
installed another carb:
this is a 30pict1 that I JUST got back from Rimco - rebushed. I assembled
it with: a 122.5 main. 130z emulsion tube. g65 pilot jet.
two gaskets under the float valve. accel pump shoots gas &gt;just&lt; to the
inside of the throat wall when you crack the throttle..
Engine is a 1600 SP, oo9, stock oil bath and exhaust. So here's my new set
of questions :)

Turning in the idle mixture screw ALL THE WAY slowed, but did not stop the
motor. It didn't do that before. I was able to slow it further by turning
OUT the idle speed screw (I think if I turned it out far enough, the motor
would have died). Set the idle mix screw at 2 turns and left it there.
Engine smells leaner, but now has an AWFUL bog at acceleration, will almost
die if you hit the gas; once you are thru this, it will take off nicely.
this is in all gears. Made pulling into traffic scary! Engine ran
noticeably warmer. I kinda preferred it running rich, but cool :P

SO. Do I get a bigger main? bigger emulsion?  I have read (in the english
VW shop manual) that the bigger #s on the emulsion tube mean they flow more
AIR to the mixture, which would seem to lean it too much.
Did you ever find out what the different idle/pilot jet #s mean, ie g65 vs
65, etc?
I've got a day or two to play with it, but if I can't straighten it out
i'll risk the rings by running cooler but rich w/ the other carb (desert
driving, ya know!)


NOW - having read the Solex manual offa the docs project, I SHOULD have a
120 main (venturi diam x 5) and an emulsion tube of 180 (main jet + 60); I
have a 150 and a 170, but they seem high! I'm used to running 125-140s on
emulsion tubes, depending on carb.
I am curious - does anyone run a 120 main with a 150 on a pict 30?  How
about a 122.5 w/ a 140 or higher on the 30/31?
