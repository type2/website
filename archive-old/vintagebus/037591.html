&lt;&lt; I changed the engine oil of the 1600 dp in my '60 DC  very recently (I 
like to change between 1500 and 2500 miles, depending on conditions and oil 
color), and this is the second time I had done so and found a piece of red 
RTV or some similar sealant inside the strainer.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
You could and we will only run our daily drivers with an oil filter/pump.  
Shradek (SP?) has a really good one for about $60.00, the only modification 
we do is to cut, angle downward, weld and redrill the oil passages of the 
neck of this pump/filter cover so as to drop the filter slightly below the 
heat riser coming out of the left front side of the stock muffler.  Eric&amp;Barb
