&gt; OK, but why are the axles marked with paint for L/R?  I mean I know
&gt; they're the same part, but I was assuming I needed to keep all the parts
&gt; from each side together.  Just curious.

Hi Joe,
We never have seen any markings like that, probably DPO markings.  Parts 
manual shows only one part number.  As far as we have heard or found out the 
axle tubes are the only L/R parts due to the inner RGB halfs.
