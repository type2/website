If you leave the hoses off, you decress the effective volume over the 
cylinders, heads, and oil cooler.  The air isn't that much cooler
than the engine compartment, as it comes out of the engine compartment
itself, so I doubt you could measure the difference.  I think you would
do more harm than good.

What some people do is block the outlets off to increase increase the
amount of air over the cylinders; if youre heater boxes are not 
sealed perfectly, this seems like it would help.  I don't buy the 
need to cool the exhaust for 1 &amp; 3.

&gt; last week i had the rear engine tin cover and fresh air hoses off and when i 
&gt; was replacing everything i started thinking... in the hot summer months when 
&gt; the heat wont be used, couldn't the fresh air hoses be left off, and the 
&gt; cooler air blowing out th3e fan shroud be used to lower the temp in the 
&gt; engine compartment?? i would think you could even bend the hoses around and 
&gt; direct the air to cool the tops of the heads. if i had a temp gauge i would 
&gt; give it a try and post the results... but i don't. hint... hint...
