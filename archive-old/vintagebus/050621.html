&gt; Where did you find this?  I haven't seen any of the big suppliers list it on
&gt; their websites.

Hi Thomas,
Went went down to our local branch of Bow Wow (AKA Autovise) store here in 
the PNW and inquired.  Just give them the old 111 721 551 and they should be 
able to find what you are looking for.  We found our old Email to the list 
and have reposted below.  You do have to shorten it to 596mm instead of the 
607mm we remembered!   Eric&amp;Barb  

&lt;&lt; Part number is 131 721 551.  It is interesting that we had to shorten this 
about  7mm from it's 603mm length to fit properly in our 60 panel &gt;&gt;Hi 
Clara,This is the part we bought and cut recently and is currently availble.  
It is also the longest one we could find at Bow Wow.Forgot to mention earlier 
that this sheeth has made the gas pedal better both through increased feed 
back feel, easier to work and the accelerator cable end was always a bit too 
long.  To the point that the barrel clamp locked down just forward of the 
swedged cable end.  Now the barrel clamp locks right on the mid portion of 
the swedged cable end.&lt;&lt;and the original part 111 721 551 is listed as 
&quot;Protective tube - Accelerator cable (shorten to 670 mm)&quot;. &gt;&gt;This above is 
the part listed in the bus 1963-67ish parts manual.  Why they say to cut it 
to 670 mm is beyond us!  Eric&amp;Barb
