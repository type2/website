Subject: More NQ ego!

WAITAMINUTE - I get it now! This whole thing has been concocted by Erin as
another way to stroke his ego!!! We all have to yell &quot;pretty please don't
make us sad Erin&quot; just like Caesar and the Roman Senate.... well, NQ, we're
ON to you boy!
Gosh, some people..............





&quot;Shayna - they bought their ticket; they knew what they were getting in
to... I say, 'Let 'em crash!'&quot;
