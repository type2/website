Subject: re:overheating 

Hi John.  Remember me?  Lou in Havasu.  What I've done is add an 'air scoop'
under my Westy.  I could take some pix if you are interested.  A benefit to
the scoop is you can use a screen to keep out unwanted debris, plastic
wrappers, etc. that could be sucked up into the air intake of the fan.  Also
I have made a 'cover' for the scoop for winter driving!  The scoop is on the
pass. side of the bus and enters the through the forward tin, near the
starter almost inline with the fan intake.
 All the parts are from Ace hardware, 3&quot; aluminum hose and matching vent.
I'm going to do the pressure test one of these days with the scoop
covered/uncovered to show that the scoop pressurizes the engine compartment
at speed, which I'm sure it does.

Lou &amp; Lis
(I'll go shoot some pix)
