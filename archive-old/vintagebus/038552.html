&gt; That reminds me of a friend of mine that had and uncle back in the 70s
&gt; that had a VW shop.  His method was very similar except that he would
&gt; drive down a railroad track to speed up the loosening process.  Sounds
&gt; like the cheapest way to do it and it sounds like it's pretty effective.

Am I right or am I wrong...........isn't this what split machanics is all
about........doing what you have to do to get the job done and get it back
on the road.  I've used pop top pulls, nylon string, things I've found
alongside the road and yes, even gum to get Louise up and running again.
Letting the air our of the rear tires to lower the engine onto a milk crate
to remove it because I didn't have a jack.  Can't do that with most
vehicles.  Makes us special.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
