Of course it is, we're talking about classic cars here.  I know a couple
of Model A ford fanatics who not only look for the correct markings but
also for the correct plating.  Having zinc plated bolts where the bolts
should be galvanized means the difference between winning and losing at a
Ford show!

May VWs never get that picky!
