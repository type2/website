Subject: Tire Size Numbers???

If I understand correctly, 185-75R14 means, 185mm wide, the height is
75% of the width, and fits a 14&quot; rim.
So to calculate overall tire diameter the formula is
(185mm*0.75*2)/10/2.54 + 14&quot; or something like that.

What is an 185R14 ?  Is there a default if the %height is left out, like
80% or something like that?

Sorry for the basic question.  Couldn't find anything in the archives.
