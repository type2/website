Subject: Buses in the Shop 3 (7.19.03) This Saturday!

Just a reminder to everyone, Buses in the Shop 3 is happening Saturday July 
19th at VolksAuthority in San Jose, CA!!  It's a totally free 
event...unless you wanna buy some parts or partake of the BBQ or 
raffle.  We're starting things up around 8am and will be running straight 
through until about 1pm.

Special! No sales tax on items purchased at VolksAuthority the day of the show!

This is a Swap N Shine event.._dot_come out and kick back with your bus 
buddies, check out rides, do a little swappin.  Swappers, since this event 
takes place in a neighborhood, we ask that you please keep your items in 
the immediate vicinity of your buses.  Please no huge spreads of blue tarps 
and stuff.  We will be enforcing this or else the SJPD is likely to come 
out and do it for us.

&quot;Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm...&quot; - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
