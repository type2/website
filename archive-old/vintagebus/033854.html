This brings up an interesting question:

Which combo will give the better performance, the 009 with a 30 series carb,
or a vacuum dizzy with a 34 pict?

Dave,
You are going in the right direction to change out the 009 distributor
to get rid of the hesitation. The 34 pict carb was designed to run only
with the Dual Vacuum distributor. Any other distributor will come with
it's own hesitation problems
The only way to run a 009 on a dual port motor is to have dual carbs or
use an adapter to run  a 30 series carb.
Just my two cents.
Gary
