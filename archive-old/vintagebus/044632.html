&lt;&lt; I like having a barndoor bus.    But 
I am not putting it on ebay with the intent of creating a stir and then not 
selling it.   Of course, now you say you did it as a kick, but  I think you 
might be leaving the impression  that people should not take you at face 
value.&gt;&gt;

sorry,  it is not on ebay, and if I do sell my '53, I would want more than 
3K.  (heck it even has a middle seat)
