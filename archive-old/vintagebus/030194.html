Subject: tranny opinions

I just got back from a trip from here in dallas to stockton california
and back in the 65 bus. I had just finished coating the interior in
por-15 and then spraying it with noisekiller. The noise was less in the
bus and will prbably be even better when I finally get the interior
pannels done in the bus, but it is still pretty loud up near 4000 rpm. I
would appriciate any experience other people here have had in reducing
freeway noise in their bus. Also while I was up in stockton, I found a
swingaxle kit for my bus that was inexpensive. I had been considering
putting in a freeway flyer tranny, but I met someone who was raving
about how much better his bus handled on the freeway since he lowered
it. I would like a little better speed on the freeway without winding
out the motor, but I have heard stories about bad gas mileage with the
freeway flyer. I wanted to know if this was true and if  it was true
with swingaxle swap. The ground clearance is nice , but we do a lot of
cross country traveling  in the bus, so anything that would improve that
experience would be great.
