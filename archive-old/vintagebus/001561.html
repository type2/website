Subject: Update on Performance Parts
Date: Thu, 25 May 2000 11:47:20 -0500

Exactly one month ago today, I ordered the idle stop arms, adjustor screws,
and springs from Performance Parts Warehouse in Happauge, N.Y.  These people
are the Italian carb import kings of the U.S. (supposedly)  I finally called
them yesterday asking why my parts hadn't arrived.

They lost the order - they had to record that I had even called.

So I suggested they 2nd day priority the parts to me as my engine has been
sitting on the stand for a month awaiting the necessary parts.  He said
they'd be here Friday so we'll see what happens.

BTW:  I did call them 2 weeks into my waiting period and left a message on
their we-promise-to-call-you-back-system but of course, nothing transpired
from that.
