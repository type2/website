I finally found a local outlet for the Mr. Heater Portable Buddy and checked
one out.

It's a bit larger than I expected.  I think it would fit in the aisle
between the front seats of a baywindow bus, but it wouldn't leave room for
much else.

Even on the lowest heat setting it was really blasting everything around it.
Perhaps that's on purpose, so that your &quot;enclosed space&quot; gets so hot you are
forced to open windows and provide the necessary ventilation for safety.

The built in safety device is a sort of pilot light.  Assuming everything
works properly, a low oxygen situation is supposed to douse the pilot light.
When that happens the unit is supposed to shut itself off automatically.
Things mechanical and electronic being what they are, I'm not certain I'd
stake my life on that.

I asked the manager of the store, a gas-heating device specialty place,
about the disparity between the manufacturer's safety claims and the trade
organization's stern warning.  He said it's just a &quot;liability thing&quot; to
protect against lawsuits by those misusing the heaters.  If that's the case,
I would expect the manufacturer to be the one seeking liability protection.

Your &quot;sauna&quot; comment is on the money.  A lot of moisture is released into
the atmosphere by these devices, and some ventilation is needed to prevent a
soggy bus interior.  Another point in favor of the externally vented
heaters.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Weve been having this conversation at the PAVanagon list.  Apparently
this brand of heater is specifically designed for closed space and has its
own oxygen sensor.  http://www.mrheater_dot_com/buddy2.htm

$100 or so allegedly at Home Depot and those kinda places.  Uses 1 lb
propane bottles.  Only drawback seems to be that it uses one up in 3-6
hours.  It also has the potential of turning your bus into a sauna.  Hot
rocks and water ladle not included.  &lt;&lt;
