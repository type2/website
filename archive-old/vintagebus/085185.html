Hey Folks,
All this chatter on the od brake drum got me curious so I e-mailed
the seller in the Phillipines. This is what she returned with:

Hello and thank you for your email.

Re: T2 Brake Drum # 200-609-215 / 200-609-617

Early VW Bus, Kombi, Panel and Pick-up with:

you so much.

As I said those numbers don't cross in my VW parts book for early bus
so perhaps they are some kind of &quot;repop&quot;? Moreover being listed in the 
Baywindow
want ad section of the samba seems to indicate some kind of 
mis-understanding on the sellers part.
I would think they don't belong there. Overall I would think the wise mans 
money
would stay in his pocket.

 That same vendor has been selling through quite a bit of NOS stuff.
 Maybe its only supposed to be a hub on a service trailer? I don't
 think it has a brake ring.

 Why don't you ask to see a pick from the other side?

 I searched the seller's other items and found a picture of the back in
 an ad for type 3 parts.  I thought maybe it was some sort of disc
 brake adapter, but it does actually have a drum.
