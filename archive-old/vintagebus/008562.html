&gt; Hey y'all.  I have the privilege of occasionally helping spin a wrench on
a
&gt; most pristine 1965 21 window.  The owner had been experiencing an exhaust
&gt; leak where the heat exchangers meet the muffler.  thinking the doughnuts
&gt; were gone, we removed the muffler and replaced the gaskets.  The leak was
&gt; the same.
&gt;
&gt; As I thought about it, I realized the outside diameter of the heat
exchanger
&gt; where it meets the muffler was about 6mm less outer diameter than the
inside
&gt; diameter of the doughnut.  The leak was temporarily stopped with, believe
it
&gt; or not, Duct tape.  Seems to be holding.
&gt;
&gt; Question is, why the disparity in heater box diameter and doughnut sizes?
&gt; The parts books all claim the same kit from about 1961 to 1972 (pancake
&gt; engine).  Is there a different kit (doughnut) that should be used instead?


Someone has the wrong info in your parts books....
Up to engine number 7 336 419, the pipes were 32mm.
From engine number 7 336 420, the pipes are 35mm.
Engine number 7 336 420 came in bus # 1 048 085 which was built 12/62 as a
1963 year model.
You have miss-matched early heater boxes with a late muffler.
You need box numbers 113 255 107 and 108 which are also on late [carbed]
bugs....
