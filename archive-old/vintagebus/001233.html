I never realized you could make a type one engine in a bus cruise at 65 mph
all day and even speed up and pass people. Spent the weekend running around
NE Kansas with No Quarter and was quite impressed with what a 1776 cc with
dual webers could do in a splitty.  We had the bus loaded 4 people and their
gear too. We didn't stop for gas much, but when we did we always got a lot
of smiles.  Can't wait to get my bus up and running!

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
