&gt; Anybody have a source for that tool.  I've looked locally with no luck. 
&gt; Maybe a motorcycle shop???

Hi Steve,
Someone on this list just a while ago found the same jet gauge as we have 
from a supplier of aftermarket carbs for VW (Weber?).  We just found this 
supplier lists a jet gauge at:
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.racecarsupply_dot_com/html/carburetor.html&quot;&gt;http://www.racecarsupply_dot_com/html/carburetor.html&lt;/A&gt;
  We got our's through a friend at &quot;Bow Wow&quot; auto parts, and it was a pain 
for him to locate us one.
