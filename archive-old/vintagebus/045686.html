 When i turn the key switch to &quot;on&quot;, the turn signals
 and emergency flashers will not work anymore. 
 Nothing.  Everything else seams to be all right.  As
 soon as i turn the ignition back off, wala.  It all
 works again.

something is messed up with your 15 connections.   that is the hot that goes 
on with the key on, the wire is black.  turns on second fuse from right.  if 
that is connected wrong somewhere with theturn signal system the two hot 
would cross themselves out and wala no lights.   

so those black wires at the speedo, maybe some things is shorting throiugh 
the dash blink light- un plug that dash turn sig blink light, does that make 
a dif?
