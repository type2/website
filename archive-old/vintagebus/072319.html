&lt;&lt; I'm looking for a decent rear bumper (blade only) for a '64 SInglecab. I'm 
 under the impression they are a different size then a standard bus?
 
 Thanks

same as for a standard bus..    mid 60 and earlier trucks came w/ a diff rear 
bumper, though bus ones bolt to truck okay .

the 58 and earlier truck rears look much more square cornered than the 58 and 
earlier non truck rear bumpers.
