 I have a 65 DC and I just tore down the front wheels. After sorting out the
 brakes I put the whole thing back together. My question is about how to
 tighten the nuts. How tight should they be? I tightened and loosened the
 inner nut a bunch of times to seat the bearings and make sure the reading
 was accurate but im not sure how much play I need. I was grabbing the drum
 and push/pulling at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock until I have almost no movement.
 The wheel seems to turn rather sluggishly now though. However if I loosen
 the nut just a hair then the play seems too much. Any tips???  I had a wheel
 come off on me while driving some time ago and ever since I try to be VERY
 thorough with wheels :)
 Thanks for the help!

there is some official measurement in thausandths of inches of the amount of 
play they should have,  but the way I figure it is if I can move that thrust 
washer.  I pry at it with a screwdriver against the drum.   you may want to 
try a couple places, as it'll probably be moved to one side or the other 
already.    So if it doesn't move, it is too tight.  and since the wheel is 
not spinning freely I would think it is too tight.  One tricky bit is 
tightening the nuts against each other- you nee to use two wrenches. the 
adjustable kind or a 27mm.   But if you dont hold that inner nut, it will 
tighten too.  And the wrench holding the inner nut has to be slim enough so 
the outer nut can still turn.  Or you can use the bay window style front axle 
nuts- the ones with those allen screws to lock them in place.  SO definately 
check to see if the thrust washer moves after you snug the axle nut (s) in 
place

It's funny you should mention it, cause when I jacked up my 61 to change the 
front tires the other day, the right front one the wheel dragged.  I loosened 
the axle nuts and no drag.  hm.  I had messed with that last only in March or 
April.  Guess they tighten themselves up.   The way the threads are they 
would tighten up rather than come off.   Anyway,  I made sure the nuts were 
well tightened against each other.  With two wrenches.   I have this 27mm 
wrench I bought at a pawn shop, and used a grinder to make the open end slim 
enough to work on the inside nut.
