what happened to &quot;I hope all your f*cking computers 
crash and burn in a plastic goopy mess!!&quot; and 
&quot;Kill your computer!!&quot;?

Has anyone ever seen a subhatch westy painted 
burgundy &amp; cream like an Buick Rivierra and with 
Pertronix stock from the factory?

man, times have changed...

from December of '97:

&quot;With the holidays almost gone (hooray!) I guess it's 
time for me to fall into that cliche' sh*t about new 
resolutions, lists and all that crap the media claims 
to be important.  First off, I hope nobody got 
botulism (sic) from Thanksgiving and that all this 
&quot;terrible&quot; weather hasn't left anyone in need of a new

bus.  I also hope we've all had some time to reflect 
about the current situation and state of affairs with 
the club.  Personally, I'm a bit annoyed, but maybe 
it's just me???  Where is all the support at the 
meetings and why the hell haven't we done anything 
cool lately (besides the &quot;show&quot;) such as last year's 
crest cruise and or the ever-so-popular baceball (sic)

game fiasco??  Who cares that it's cold?  Maybe we 
should have a &quot;who has the best (stock, of course) 
heat contest.  Next subject.  Why I don't like 
Pertronix.  Sorry kids, you will NEVER convince me.  
Unlike many, I really don't mind working on my car, 
and checking points is oh so time consuming and so 
damned difficult.  I feel that Pertronix is for lazy, 
unattentive slobs who probably don't even ever add oil

to the felt under their rotors!!  Next thing you know,

you'll all want hydraulic lifters so you don't ever 
have to adjust your valves!  (LAZY SLOBS!!!)  Granted,

I'm not always 100% on time with my maintenance, but 
at least I do the little things that make the big 
differences.  Don't be so damned lazy about it.  Do 
you love your bus?  Predictions for 1998:  More splits

will appear from the woodwork.  Someone will rip 
somebody off in the club.  I will check, replace, and 
adjust my points (and love it!!).  I will sit and 
stare at my engine as it purrs in that special VW 
air-cooled way.  You will all be angry at me for my
viewpoint.
I hope all your f*cking computers crash and burn in a 
plastic goopy mess!!
Kill your computer!!
Happy Holidays,
Jon&quot;

Let the excitement begin!
