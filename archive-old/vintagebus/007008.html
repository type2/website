I have a brand new VW factory duel port 1600 that was frieght damaged for
sale for $1000.00 dollars. These now sell new for $1395.00. The only problem
I can see is that the pushrod tubes are bent, which I am going to replace.
This engine cannot be warrantied due to the damage but is BRAND NEW never
been run. Use as/is or you have a great base for your hot rod engine. I only
have 1 of these engines so it will be first come on this. I have used one of
these (frieght damaged) in my own bus and also have put one in my wifes 65
type 1 I'm building for her (I know it's a type one) and let me say it's a
lot harder doing a type 1 then a type 2 (non deluxe). Gotta love those
trucking compinies, even boxed on a pallet they still seem to be able to
damage these, put the forks through the box to move the engine around.
