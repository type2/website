Subject: BusDepot Test Site RUNNING AGAIN

The New BusDepot_dot_com test site is back up. Beta testing will continue
until 5 pm today eastern time. If I get enough feedback from y'all by
then (and can get any corrections done on time) I may bring it live as
soon as that.  I'll keep you posted. Meanwhile, please keep checking and
reporting! You're really helping. I've made about 30 corrections already
due to your emails.
