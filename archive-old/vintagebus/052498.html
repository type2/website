Subject: RE: [VB] removing inner  front wheel bearing

I agree with Clara that the beam is easier to work on with it in the bus or
have it firmly planted on the ground in a stand.  I didn't build my stand
until after it was all taken apart and cleaned.  I can remember wrestling
with it to get stuff off.  Good thing it weighs a good amount to begin with.

I keep hearing how people drop the beams, and then take stuff off.   I find
it easier to dissassemble as much as possible while attached to the bus.  As
it is held firmly in place.  Makes it easier to bash the offending bearing
off.
