Yeah, they're great, but the $1200+ price tag is a bit
much for the casual user.  I bought myself one for a
birthday present this year, and am really pleased, but
that's a lot of money to spend just to cut metal a
little faster.

No room for more busses, and no wife to spend my money
on, so tools are the thing!
