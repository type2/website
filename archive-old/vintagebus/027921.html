Are you saying my westfalia is worthless?
It was painted brown/yellow back in 1955!

&lt;&lt;Well according to the general consensus of those that have responded on the

list to the Kustom Panel, sounds like Binz is a hack, being that it isn't VW

made, just some aftermarket company hacking a bus into something it wasn't

meant to be. The same must go for the bestalwagon (spelling) another

aftermarket thing. Everybody has there taste, wants and  feelings,

expressions etc. Most people think there buses are priceless, I do of my DD,

but to chastiz a person for doing something they enjoy, ripping on them for

asking such a high price, would you give your stuff away, or would you try

to get what YOU feel it is worth, not what the &quot;MARKET&quot; dictates. If you

want something bad enough you'll pay whatever it takes. I just had a

conversation with a good friend (owns a body shop) about prices. I need a

door for the new/old diesel Ford bus hauler I just bought. $88.00 dollars

for a Taiwan door shell, $145.00 for a better repo and $250.00 from F#rd or

$150.00 for used. Then I thought to myself about the bitching people do when

they have to pay $100.00 dollars for an absolutly MINT pre 62 bus door,

that's a perfect 40 plus year old door! where's the logic. This logic people

use always seems to get to me. What qualifies a Kustom, reconditioned,

restored, perfect restoration, 100% original, driver, show bus. Somebody

please lay down the rules!! I guess Kelly Park will be the defining factor

to this question by what they will allow and won't into the show. I'd hate

to be the person deciding if a bus is custom or not. Thom's panel is a

custom, isn't it. Bright yellow paint, filled in back window, tent, none of

this original to the bus. So according to what most people are saying,

anything none stock would be classified a custom, if it isn't pure stock,

i.e.; engine, trans, tires, etc. Let everybody be themselves, enjoying there

buses and helping the hobby grow, regardless of your or my likes and

dislikes.
