I told Ronnie Devries last night that I woke up with my heart pounding and
in a cold sweat from a bad nightmare.  I dreamed that my bus was missing and
when I went looking for it, I found out a guy had cut it up in 4 big
sections with a cutting torch.  When I asked him about it, he assured me
that I could weld it back together rather easily.  I woke up shortly
thereafter and frantically tried to think of where I'm currently storing the
bus.  I was relieved when I realized the location in the dream wasn't where
I'm storing the 66.  WHEW!

Anyway, after 4 years since getting my bus, it looks like this year I'll get
to bring it into town and start working on it.  Unfortunately, as it sits,
the bus is not ready to roll.  I took off the rims that were on it and had
them powdercoated gloss white.  But there are several reasons now why I
don't want these rims:

1)  4 of them are 14&quot; rims and I want 15&quot;
2)  after sandblasting, nobody at the shop bothered to pick out the sand
grains wedged in the seams so now I have powdercoated sand in the rims.  It
doesn't affect anything, it just won't win you any shows.  You can't see it
unless you look really close - were talking a space of  1/16&quot; or less.
3)  1 rim is a 15&quot; (with a broken clip)
4)  in my haste, I didn't repair some broken clips.

So here's the deal.  I'm willing to trade all 5 of these rims straight
across to someone who has a set of 5 - 15&quot; bus rims.  I think the bus rims
are 4.5&quot; across.  I'm not interested in any of the rims where the hub caps
snap into little indentations in the rims - I want rims that take clips.
The rims must be straight but rust is okay as I'll get them blasted and
coated.  Also, I'll take rims with missing clips as I can get these from WCM
and put them on myself.

BTW:  Does anyone have any advice as to whether or not to powdercoat the
clips before or after they are installed?  I'm afraid of doing it before in
case riveting them to the rim would distort them a little bit and cause the
powdercoat to flake off.

Thanks for your help.  I've just got to buckle down and get this bus
rolling.  I've got a name picked out for her and I've got this deep urge to
get out and do some bus events.

Oh and just to show I'm serious, I'm willing to foot the shipping for my
rims and for the rims that would need to be sent to me.  This way, someone
will get a set of powdercoated rims (with a few anomolies mind you) with no
money involved.

Thanks for the help.
