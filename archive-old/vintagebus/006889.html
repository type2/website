I had 4 tracks when I was in high school, replaced my 45 under dash record
player in my 58 Hillman Husky with the 4 track, these were built by Muntz,
the original automobile tape players, after that I stepped up to the eight
track, very high tech back then. You have heard of 45's.

&lt;&lt;  Does anyone have any of the old 4-track tapes? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rick,
We have never heard of 4-track tapes.  &quot;Playtape&quot; yes, but not 4-track.  Do 
you possibly mean 8-track?  Eric&amp;Barb
