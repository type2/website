Subject: Leaks Return :/
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, my new window seals in the front and rear of my 63 Camper definitely
are better than what used to be there, but I think the rust ate away just
enough of the lip that a little bit of water gets into the cab area.  Not
exactly pleased, but so long as it stays away from the electrics, I'll
deal.  Does anyone know if I can add a little bit of silicone or something
under the seal to help keep water out?

And I know some of you have taken apart those HEHRL windows (aka: the
louvered windows) during restoration.  It seems like my driver's side long
Riviera-style window is leaking a little water onto the table.  Anyone know
how to reseal those...if they make seals or if I have to fab them myself?

Muchas Danke!
