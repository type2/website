Hi,

Here in South Africa we got a lot of these strange Brazilian hybrids. We got
split window Brazilian buses until about '76(fig?) and after that the weirdo
buses began. The first hybrids had early bay noses and front doors, the
flimsy BD type cargo doors and narrow splitty rear hatches with the long
rectangular bay window rear light clusters. Fellow South African list
memeber fig has a few Brazilian split windows in his collection.
