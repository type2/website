&lt;&lt; You have got to be kidding me?????????????  To carry all that stuff, you 
must haul a utility trailer behind you everywhere you go! &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Well when I (Eric) brought over to your place our 1960 panel camper it had 
all of these parts and tools in it.  Did you see a trailer behind it?  NO!  
Will see about visiting you in a little over a week from now and show how and 
where all this packs away.  First have to get to Sacramento for some VW fun!
