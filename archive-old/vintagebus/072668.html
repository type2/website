&gt; For those of you who have never heard, or have forgotten. type2_dot_com
&gt; has a small irc server setup which allows real time communication for
&gt; those of us who don't seem to think that email is quick enough ;)
&gt;
&gt; it's at irc.type2_dot_com channel #buslist

FWIW there is also a Java powered IRC client for accessing our servers
only:

http://www.type_dot_com/~keen/irc

It's a bit rough, but it does work.

Best bet is to click the &quot;setup&quot; button and choose a &quot;Nick&quot; then hit
connect.
