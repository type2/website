Hi Jason,
That is an auto shut off valve for the idle circuit and is to prevent 
dieseling on instead of keeping your carb adjusted properly.  Connect this to 
the positive side of the coil.
  Sounds like your battery is having problems it should have easily turned 
the engine over for several minutes.  Time to check your battery, connections 
and possibly your starter.
  Yes, it does take a bit of turning the engine over to fill a dry carb.  
Before installing a we like to pour some fuel in the carb inlet tube using a 
plastic fuel filter cut into a funnel and a piece of flex fuel line.
