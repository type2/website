Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

&gt; about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; my bus
&gt; only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or I am
&gt; going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case of
&gt; 'speed envy' coming on &lt;vbg&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; My '67 std is stock everything with a 1600SP engine.  I am running P225R-15
&gt; tires.

You may have answered your question with your last statement. Your 67 bus is NOT
stock with 225 15's on it. Stock is 185 14.
Your speedo is calibrated for 14&quot; tires. 63 and back buses with 15&quot; wheels have
a different ratio speedo. I believe you are going a lot faster then what your
speedo indicates.
