Subject: re: Espar heaters

I was curious about this so I called a local supplier.  The B1LC model
that can replace the old ones is a whopping $1400!!!  The guy on the
phone stated that there just about the best you can buy though.
    Just thought anyone out there who's really cold, and has money to
burn, would be interested.
