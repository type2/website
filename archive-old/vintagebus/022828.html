Well,  I started on the paint tonight - I just couldn't wait...

I painted the engine lid, dash tray, rear apron, ash tray cover, radio
block-off and safaris.

I shanked the engine lid paint big time.  Hint: shoot something you don't
care about first, to get the pattern, volume and air right.  Oh well.  It
has enuf paint (*grin*) but it will need some finish work.

Everything else came out beautifully.

Um, but so much for thinking this yellow was &quot;subdued&quot;  - once sprayed, it
doesn't look anything like the splotch I showed you.  It's bright!  Which
is OK with me, I think it's kinda cool.  Maybe the soccer moms on cell
phones (had to throw that in!) will see me now...
