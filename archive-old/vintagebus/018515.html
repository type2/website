 I agree totally. I offered to make things right, by
locating and paying half for the missing piece but he
refused!! Wouldn't even consider it.He already knew it
was missing a piece, but didnt tell me and sent it
anyway.I opened the package 1 month later (because I
was out of town) and found out the bad news...(after
it was too late to return, according to woody).To make
this short, he's a $_at_#head. I have been into busses
since 1985 and this dealing is the worse I have ever
went thru. OK I may be late at sending that thing, but
he was always informed of the status. I'm sorry if I'm
a busy man and my family/business do come first, but
as they say, $h!+ happens. I thought bus owners were
cool, but I guess I found one that isn't. Too bad a
j_at_&amp;% off like him ruined my feelings for this hobby.
Self centered people $UCK! Remember this, there are 2
sides to each story!
Jimmy
p.s. he even threatened me (&quot;dont make me get ugly on
you&quot;) jeez!
