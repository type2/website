Steve,

Two things come to mind.

#1 You may now have issues with a stock exhuast lining up correctly.

#2 You may need to shim you rockers due to changing geometry 
resulting from shimming the heads. If you shim the heads.

I am by now means an expert and hope other with real experience will chime in.

Thanks
