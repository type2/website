Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

Hi Kevin,
I asked this question to por 15 and the response i received was: &quot;Pressure wash the entire bottom
with soapy water only, let dry thoroughly and then spray por 15.&quot;


 No physical labor involved except holding the gun trigger down. sounds like a good plan to me for
buses covered with surface rust on the bottom. This wouldnt work if you still had paint on the
underside tho since the por would have trouble sticking. A little goes a long way, plus you thin it
when you spray it so a quart seems like it would be enough, $30.

&gt; I have been contemplating this undercoating thing for a while now.i.e.
procrastinating. But I am wondering what the best method is.

b)por-15 - supposedly very good, may require a lot of prep work, and a
 little pricey
