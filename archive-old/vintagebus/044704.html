Subject: 1957 Tail Lights
To: Disconcerter_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Everyone,
I've been shopping around for a set of tail lights for my 57 truck (that I'm 
hoping to  get on the road soon), but some places are telling me that the 58 
tail lights are the same as the 57 year.  That doesn't sound quite right, can 
anyone help me out of this dilemma. Also would 6.70x15 tires be ok for the 
truck?
                                                                      Thanks
                                                                      Steve
