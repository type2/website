 &gt; fwiw, Your truck came with the same rear bumper as a non truck type2, 63
 did
 &gt; not have a truck only rear bumper
 &gt;
 
 I have seen the fabled truck-only bumper and it actually exists. Harry Houck
 of Fresno has pictures.
 We saw it at the Madera S*T* show a couple of years ago. I think it was on a
 '67 crew-cab.
 Harry? &gt;&gt;

actually mid year 1960 was when they dropped the rear truck only bumper 
concept.  Of course there is the stamped rear truck bumper, then the ever so 
rare one 1/2 year slash rear truck bumper, I've seen two!!!!   Neither on a 
truck.  :)
