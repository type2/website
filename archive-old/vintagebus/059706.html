Subject: RE: [VB] re:aluminum engine cases

Kevin


The old engine cases were made out of magnesium and some other type of
metals. They have just started making\selling the aluminum engine cases
or at least now that I am in the market for one I see them as well. 



Eric


Could you clarify a little bit....what are most engine cases made out
of?
and which type did you have that cracked?

sorry i thought all cases were made of the same material.
