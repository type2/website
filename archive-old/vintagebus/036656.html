Hi there,

As far as I can tell the rear gate from any pre vanagon truck will fit.

My '60 Dcab (built Dec '59) wears shortened side gates and a stock rear gate
from a mid 70's baywindow. The bay gates are exactly the same height as
those from a split but the side gates are 100mm longer.

Later 

Michael
