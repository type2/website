Subject: experiences with pierburg carbs?

anyone out there running the 'pierburg kafer' 34 pict 3 carb?  good, 
bad?  what size jets are in there?
i bought one from cip1; no marks on the idle jet and their tech 
support says no marks on ANY jet.
also, the day the damn thing arrived, another vendor implied these 
were caca.  i found no obvious defects - it does smell of gas, and 
has some white reside in the vent tube... but cip1 claims they are 
tested so maybe not a prob....

there were no hostile posts on the samba, and trolling thru google 
turned up only 2 defective ones, so thought i'd try one, but 
acccording to the other vendor i am in for even more fun with my 
motor.
:P

PS- anyone with a  cip1 horror story and an amicable resolution. i'd 
like to hear it - just in case!
