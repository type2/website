Subject: Re: [VB] Bumper Restoration or crazy idea #839?
Message-ID: &lt;0.81963210.258a8d9f_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Ive seen it done on a rear bumper (pre-58)
Has a big press, and molds of the rear bumper.
STAMP!
Basically he could make a rear bumper out of a flat piece of sheet metal.
But that was only good for about 4 feet on the flat section of the rear 
bumper.
Never saw his get creative enough for the front, or for the corners.

&lt;&lt;Hello All,
 Last night I was in the shop lookin at the dents in
the bumpers of the S/C tryin to figure out how to fix
em...  this morning it came to me:)
 A friend of mine does mok-ups on plane parts....
pullin molds in other words... thats where the idea
came from... what I came up with was to pull a mold
off a straight section of the bumper, inside &amp; out...
fiberglass will do the trick witha little release
agent... take the mold &amp; cut them in half to reveal a
perfect profile of the bumper. Run down to the metal
recycle place &amp; pick up 2 chunks of 6x6x4 mild steel.
Throw the steel on the milling machine, then we can 
build a set of dies to put in the 20 ton press to
press out the bumpers to thier original shape:) May
have to throw a little heat to em.... Im not crazy, am
I?
 Sounds doable... anyone ever tried it? 
Later,
&gt;&gt;
