Subject:  RE: [VB] 1960 15 window progress and front hub seals

&gt;The front backing plates were covered with grease due to the
&gt;fact that the PO never reinstalled the grease seals. It looked like they
did
&gt;the front brakes but couldn't get the inner bearings off so reinstalled the
&gt;drums without pressing in the grease seal, they were the original
metal/felt
&gt;ones.
    

When you say 'original' is there a 'modern' rubber replacement
seal available?  I bought new seals for my 23 project here in Oz but they
were 
'original' metal/felt (211 405 641A).  I would actually be much happier with
a
'modern' press in rubber seal if they are available....are they? 
And, if so, would anyone have a part no. for them?

Thanks
