&gt;    Is our beloved Vintagebus list dying?  There seems to be less and less
&gt; messages,

Ronnie, et al,

I for one have been too busy having fun with my new found stopping power and
just driving the Double Cab.

AC would be nice, but open windows are doing just fine.

On the story front, I do have one to relate.

Last sunday, my daughter and I were coming back from church when the
throttle cable snapped.
I did some checking and found that it broke near the gas pedal and was
fixable.

My daughter's comment was, &quot;What are we going to have to do, walk home?&quot;

No, I'm going to fix it right here.

I dove into my spare parts kit, pulled out a work t-shirt and changed
shirts.
I made a loop in the cable using a hose clamp and a bolt to provide the
extra diameter needed by the hose clamp and then was able to connect the
loop to the throttle linkage.

Five minutes later, we were back on the road again.

If anyone has seen those banners that cities use along side street poles to
advertise events, they make excellent roll out mats to work on during
roadside fixit stops.  I have a couple from the Los Angeles marathon that I
use.  They are about 32 inches wide and just over 6 feet long.  Unroll it,
and lay it out where you have to work under the bus.
