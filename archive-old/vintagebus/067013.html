Subject: Ohio Bus event 3rd Annual Buses, Boats, n Bands

Hey Y'all,
Allright, let's start talking about 2003 VW Events. Details are now finalized
for the Third Annual VW Buses, Boats, 'n Bands Event, just north of
Cincinnati, Ohio. The event will be May 16-18 (the weekend BETWEEN Mothers Day
and Memorial Day). There will be a new Location this year. The Olive Branch
Campground will be our new host. They are located 4 miles upstream from last
years site, which is 36 miles north of Cincinnati right off of Interstate 71.
I believe Olive Branch Campground will better suit our needs because they have
Electric &amp; water hook ups (in case we need to run heaters!) Plus they have
added amenities such as: Big Playground for the Kiddies, a heated game room
and laundry room, a small fishing pond, a large open field for frisbee hackey
kids &amp; dogs, multiple shower houses, swimming pool (not that we'll use in
May), and is much easier to access via Interstate 71.
Highlights will include: 8 mile canoe trip on the Little Miami River (as long
as there is no flood again!), LIVE music in the campground, World famous Full
Moon Bus Club Breakfast burritos, Door Prizes, technical demonstrations, and
More! You can see all event details at the web page:

or email me for info or if you would like to donate a door prize or conduct a
technical demo.


Peace, John Baker
