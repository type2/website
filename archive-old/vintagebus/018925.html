Subject: Re: 6-12 volt conversion

  I was watching My Classic Car a few weeks ago and 
they had a thing on 6-12 volt conversion that I thought 
was pretty cool. First was a battery that was actually 
2 6 volt batterys run in parrelel to function as a 6 
volt battery EXCEPT when the key was turned, then they 
beCAME a 12 volt battery just to the starter to give 
the car a good start. Neat. Battery number 2 was again 
2 6 volt cells, except it was a 12 volt battery with a 
terminal in the middle (of the ceells) that was a 6 
volt positive output. Ideal for hooking up wipers. 
semarphores, etc. So you have to convert the car, but 
can still use your 6 volt devices with no voltadrops. I 
thought it was neat. I dont know anything about where 
to get this, but i bet the my classic car website would 
have a start if someone is interested..
