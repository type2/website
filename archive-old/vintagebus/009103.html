Subject: time to fix this leaky tranny

Couple little questions, as I'm planning to finally get in there and fix
that leak this week sometime.

Anyone know how much gear oil the tranny holds?  GL-4, right?  Last week it
took 1.4 litres to top it up after about 2500 miles of driving.

I keep reading about people squirting the oil in with some type of gun or
something??  What is this exactly?  All the grease guns I can find look like
caulking guns and take tubes of grease.  I'd really like it if there was a
better way than trying to defy gravity by squeezing the oil out of the
bottle into the transmission while it oozes down my arm.  Ahhh.. eau de gear
oil.  attracts boys like flies.  not.

Wish me luck,
Diana
