haven't seen the mag yet.
saw a 554 mile barn kept 57 kombi with nice original paint w/ pinstripes.    
cant remember if the 54 kombi I had had them- it had really faded original 
paint.  My 53 standard came with  them.    Was it Darin Matsuno's 53?    If 
so, it's a nice bus IMOPBO.

Anyone see that '53 Barndoor Kombi in Hot VWs this month?  It said in the

article that that white pinstiping was factory-correct.  Is this true? 

I've never noticed a pinstriping line on the original paint Kombis I've

seen.  On Standards and Deluxes, yes.
