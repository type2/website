Subject: Totaled bus restores another ( or why to have insurance)
Date: Tue, 18 Jan 2000 06:17:52 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

 This is how one totaled bus will restore another. I sold the famous Jerome
9 best camper bus to a friend in LHC 2 days before thanksgiving . A drunk
driver hit the camper while it was parked in front of his house 2 days
before Christmas and totaled it. He had full coverage on it and the
insurance company paid him and gave him the bus back. . I bought the totaled
bus and am striping it to restore my 63 dd walkthru panel. Bus was hit very
hard on left rear side, buckled in the left side about 6 inches and raised
the top up about 2. All the doors, front clip,glass, inside is good.
Amblance fans, stereo, cb all working great still. Interior will go in 63 as
will stereo and cb, engine, trans. Rest is up for sale. Come by at BBBIV and
ask. Will have to come to my house to see parts ( about 3 miles from
campground). This is a great reason to get good insurance. Bring your sazall
and see all of you at BBBIV this weekend.

   BUSES BY THE BRIDGE JAN. 21,22,23 2000 in LAKE HAVASU CITY, Az. BE THERE
!!!!!!!!
