Steve,
Thanks someone else told me that also except the wires in the back
appear to be hooked up and when you pull the red emergency flasher
switch it didn't work, so I thought I would check especially since the
light was not in the owners manual.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy

&gt; &gt; Also anyone know what the big round red lens above the windshield wiper pull
&gt; &gt; switch is for.  I looked in my 65 owner's manual and it is not in the picture,
&gt; &gt; but it is definitely on my dash and on some (but not all) splits I have seen.
&gt; &gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; That is the emergency flasher indicator light.  Not sure what years it was on.
&gt; Up to 64-66 I think.  I know my 67 has the light integrated into the switch knob
&gt; itself.
