&gt; Nah
&gt; I use it on my carb studs.
&gt; Never had a problem.
&gt; The on-line spec sheets seem about right as far a &quot;breakaway torque&quot;
&gt; with the upper range being ~18ft/lbs

Try removing a broken 8mm stud with 10 threads engaged in the insert and
one thread showing outside that needs 18-foot pounds of torque to turn.  No
way I could do it!

&gt; check http://www.loctite_dot_com/datasheets/tds/Product_243.pdf
&gt;
&gt; &gt; safety-wire the nut or bolt head.
&gt; &gt; Safety wire doesn't loosen and the fastener can still be easily
&gt; &gt; removed.
&gt;
&gt; Your safety-wire idea makes sense for the top nuts and should be easy
&gt; to do. The bottom ones would be harder to do with the rocker shafts
&gt; in the way. Besides, they can be re torqued with only the disassembly
&gt; of the valve covers and the rocker assembly.

If the studs unscrew from the case, the same motion will tighten them in
the head if the nuts are prevented from turning by safety wire.  Since the
threads are the same on both ends there is nothing to cause this to occur.
