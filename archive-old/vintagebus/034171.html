I think I posted this once before, back in the early eightys the Japans were
coming over and buying up all the 356 Porsches they could, that drove the
prices up to unheard of levels, when the market peaked they brought the cars
back and resold them for major profits, again flooding the market, then the
crash, all the U.S. car investors took it in the shorts while the Japans
were laughing all the way to the bank, looking for the next vehical to
artificially inflat, could this be the VW transporter???

I imagine that at some point in the future, when the novelty wears off,
and the attention - and money - turns to something else, a lot of those
buses will be liquidated to buy the car du jour.  That's when some of
them will wend their way back here and to Europe.

&gt; The funny thing is, when was the last time you saw a bus that was sold to 
&gt; Japan, ever again? Remember the 53 or 54 deluxe that was blue and white
and 
&gt; it was in Hot VWs years ago, the title of the article was sayanora. And I 
&gt; don't remember ever hearing about a sweet bus that someone picked up in
Japan 
&gt; at there last vintage meet.
