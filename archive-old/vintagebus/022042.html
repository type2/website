Thom,

My friend here in Albuquerque has a campbox interior from an October 1955 bus 
in his '59 Sub-hatch camper (which would have been an SO-23) and he said that 
the left side had ONE rod (with just one straight section) on the bus he 
stripped to get the campbox interior.  I don't know if this is a matter of 
the campboxes being handmade or not, but that is his experience.
