Subject: early bus centrifugal distributor

i found an early bus centrifugal distributor in my collection of garbage =
and was wondering if anybody knows if it would perform any better than a =
regular 009?  i looked it up on the type 2 library and found that it =
goes to a 49 beetle and 3/55-59 buses.  if it's no different than a =
newer 009, its up for grabs if anyone wants it.  thanks!   =20
