I'm pretty sure there was a step for the other side; I think Mark Merz's old 
'54 ambulance (I shoulda bought that car!) had one; the foot pedal would be on
the other side, ie in the middle of the cargo doors and not the edge.

Your belly pan was cut?  You mean like slots for the step hanger?  You should
have the belly-pan version of the step.

Here's some pix:

&gt; The ambulance step on our 63  23  window has the belly pan cut to fit the step--it fits so

&gt; think there is a left or right step--At least i have not seen one--SOoo i think Thom you
&gt; will have to &quot;improvise&quot; for the left side of the bus--
&gt; My thought is move the step rather then cut and weld the Ambo step----, TWWM, uj
