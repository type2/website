Subject: fuel reserve cable

Well, it was a small victory for me and the bus yesterday.  I finally got
the fuel reserve cable out of the metal sleeve after much soaking, cutting
and twisting.  

Over time the plastic sheath on the cable tore and the metal innards rusted
to the inside of the metal sleeve it runs through underneath the floor and
belly pan.

It felt really good to get that done.
