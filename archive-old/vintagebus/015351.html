Subject: [VB] Moving the Westy

Thanks for the advice on getting the '67 Westy home.  It looks like I will try to slide it onto a trailer next weekend and bring it home that way.  Somebody mentioned the possibility of accidentally breaking something at the PO's place while trying to work on it, I think I would rather break it here if any breakin' is to occur!

I was also told off-list about the option code for dual circuit brakes, thanks much :-)

Andrew W.
