Looks like a Whale brand trombone pump.  I believe Whale still makes that
model, or a nearly identical newer version.

Whale pumps aren't inexpensive, but they are very high quality products.
Most can be repaired/rebuilt with factory parts/kits.

Try a West Marine or Boater's World store.  They may not stock the pump but
should have a catalog and be able to order what you need.  Pumps like this
are typically used on sailboats, so a marine store oriented to that trade
would be your best bet.

&gt;&gt;  I'm looking for a water pump like this

http://albums.photopoint_dot_com/j/AlbumIndex?u=321710&amp;a=7003687.

I have a few of the 67 and later ones, but like Robert D. I'd like to be
correct and original for my 65 PT resto.  Pleas look in your stashes for
this type of plunger water pump.  I'll even take one that is missing a
spout like the one in the pics.  &lt;&lt;
