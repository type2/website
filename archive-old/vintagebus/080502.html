Subject: Re: Bus Nose furniture

Nice job - Here's mine:   $20 at a swap, some old blinkers and  
headlights and some flourescent paint.  It has a blacklight trained on  
it. The problem I have found is because of the bowed nature, of the  
front, I should have had the top lean over more, becuase peoples knees  
keep knocking the emblem off, and their boots leave skid marks in the  
bottom of the &quot;V&quot;.  Otherwise, very functional and head-turning and fun.

Sad part is, that nose is in much better shape than the one on the 60  
dc I picked up last year
