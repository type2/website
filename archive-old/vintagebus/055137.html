&gt;&gt; I know a lot of people are really picky about getting GL-4, but I

&gt;
&gt;NO!  The numbers are not a matter of increasing specification, but of
&gt;completely different specification.  An oil can meet GL-5 and not meet
&gt;GL4!  The chemical compostions are different and the GL-5 formula allows
&gt;use of levels of chemicals that can attack the metals in your synchros.

George is right.  For more, go to 
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/search-vintagebus.html and punch in
&quot;gl4&quot; as the search term.  Read all the messages rated five buses
and as many of the four-bus ones as you care to.

As far as getting it direct, Swepco does have a Web page.  To place
an order, they want you to contact your field rep - if you tell
1.800.359.5823 or lube_at_swepcousa_dot_com where you are, they will tell
you who your rep is.  No affiliation, etc.
