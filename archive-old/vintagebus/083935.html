&gt; ... I don't know... the bus I had .... after I changed the brushes, it
charged fine and didn't eat brushes at all.   It was a daily driver
actually, too.
&gt; Since then, I have always checked the brushes on new to me engines, and
if I have the engine out and the brushes look marginal I'll changed them
while the engine is out (easier).  I also carry brushes in my spare parts
box in the bus on road trips.   That was the only time I have driven much
at all with worn gen brushes...  and in that case there were no lasting
effects.

It might have been because I was running with headlights on with marginal
brushes.  Higher current across the brushes might have caused the pitting.

Still, 700 miles....
