Subject: Re: [VB] '66 Restoration

&gt; For example, how long for a fully trained vintage bus restorer/mechanic to
&gt; fit a fuel tank to bus with engine already out?! Looks easy to me.
&gt;

That's a cinch, assuming the straps are decent or repalcements are on hand
and the tank to be installed is ready to go. Engine already out on a 66? 1
hour, 2 if cursing rusted fasteners is included. However, is he painting the
tank as well, or the engine bay, or even the straps? Time adds up and if
it's not your own it costs.
