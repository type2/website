Subject: '59 Kombi Resto...hunt for a clutch!

As you may remember, I've recently overhauled the engine that came 
with my '59 Kombi and had installed. When I took the bus for a spin, 
I noticed that the clutch was slipping. So yesterday (Sunday) I 
decided to go ahead and take care of my slipping clutch. I pulled the 
engine, grabbed the clutch parts, and headed to the parts store. I 
found a clutch kit at autozone, but the parts looked a bit 
differenent. After I got home and took a better look I realized they 
weren't gonna work. Nows the time I learned about the change in 
clutch parts for IRS type 1's. So I packed everything up and took it 
to work with me today. After driving around I found that NO parts 
place in my little town had the stuff I needed. That makes:
-2 Autozones
-2 Checkers
-1 Advance Parts
-1 Parts Plus
-2 Landers' (local)
-1 NAPA

There are a few more places, but I gave up, came home, and called 
Ronnie at http://www.oldvolks_dot_com/ . He asks me &quot;What's Up?&quot; I tell 
him I need clutch parts and he says, &quot; Yeh, I know....I was wondering 
how long it'd take you to call&quot;. I told him &quot; 'bout as long as it 
took me to drive around and find NOWHERE in town had the stuff&quot;. So 
Ronnie has me better quality parts at a better price in his own 
clutch kit.._dot_complete with gland nut needle bearings, on the way. I 
hate to have to wait...but it's getting more and more clear that's 
just the way it's gonna have to be. I mean, come on...clutch parts! 
Some place local should really have those. Whatever. From now on I'll 
just call &quot;The VW specialist&quot; himself and make sure I get what I need 
along with good customer service. ronnie also went through a bunch of 
other parts to help me try and remember ANYTHING else that I might 
need. I ended up remembering I needed a new engine seal. thanks 
Ronnie!
