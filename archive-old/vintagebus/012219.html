Subject: Re: One idea to minimize fumes in heater
Date: Fri, 04 Dec 1998 00:26:59 PST


I replyed a minute ago before reading this, but I will stick with the 
idea that heater boxes CAN be welded! When the heat is off, the hot air 
goes through the bypass, not the gaps (or at least it shouldn't) in the 
box itself. If I misunderstood the previous post, and that is possible, 
I am only talking about the box to j tube seam, not the bypass. Its just 
a matter of cheap manufacture. Press fit seams that work OK, but not 
welded down. In addition, the little bit of play in the j tube relative 
to the box allows for some room of error on installation of the exhaust 
port and the tin below.
&gt;Re: the process you performed below...I'm 99.9% sure that the designers 
of
&gt;said heat exchange system had a reason for the gap you welded shut.
