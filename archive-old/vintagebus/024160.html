&lt;&lt; Since someone else brought it up.  I've been doing some off the cuff
 research (is there any other type?) on this hump seat thing.  I've come up
 with a '61/'62 only thing.  Anyone else care to comment?  BTW I've only seen
 these seats with the 3 position &quot;cheese grater&quot; (my name) brackets.  Is this
 correct???
 
 Anyone have a hump seat (complete) they might want to part with???  Need the
 brackets too.  I have a nice 1/3 2/3 to trade or cash.

buses switched to the 1/3 2/3 front seat at ch #971 550  , that's 30 July 62. 
 Same time they went to the later wheel wells and dog legs, and made a deeper 
spare tire recess in the partition behind the front seat (non walk through).

I have the same impression that the hump seat is a 61/62 thing.   FWIW my 
april 61 deluxe has a hump seat (original).  It has the 3 place adjustable 
seat cheese grater thing.

&quot;27 Oct 60, ch 673 946  Bench seat in Cab
  Now: shape of cushion and back rest modified, both adjustable in three 
positions.&quot;

okay, seems this book agrees with you, if this &quot;modified&quot; shape means hump 
seat

I have a extra hump seat, but really do not want to ship it, what a PITA.  
are you near W WA?
