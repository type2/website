Subject: S.E.S. Fuel Injector

Anyone ever here of the S.E.S. Fuel Injector.  It attached between the fuel 
pump and the Carb I think - it had a solenoid and 'Velocity Stack' - with a 
switch that went on the dash - a guy tells me he had this on his 72 beetle 
and it would double the HP.  Should I give him the $25.00 he asking?
