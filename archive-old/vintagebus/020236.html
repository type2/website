Judging on the cost of gasoline this year, a
potentially smart move might be to fly Southwest
Airlines into Orange County for $46. per person, each
way. &lt;from Phoenix with minimum 7 day advanced
purchase&gt; Then rent your F*rd/spendy hotel rooms on
that end. 

My family has no plans on doing the OCTO/Classic shows
this year but it's always tempting. I have classes on
Friday nights until 8:30 PM and have to be back at my
job at 07:00 Monday followed by more classes Monday
night. Currently I am not seeking/selling any parts or
vehicles. Outside of seeing friends again or simply
getting out of town, I have no real reason to go.

If I didn't have classes on Friday then I'd be tempted
to caravan in my F*rd truck with the other F*rd trucks
or jump on SW.

Alas, the fun of these trips are generally the trip
it's self and related campouts plus seeking that one
last part that you need. However you choose to travel
do it safely!
