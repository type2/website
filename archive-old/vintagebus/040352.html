Hey Volks

A few weeks ago my dot_dot_com publishing employer suddenly closed down and I
found myself without a job for the first time in 10 years. So I've decided
it's time to go travelling, and live out one of my dreams.

Some of you list oldtimers might remember a Friday questionnaire about five
years back when Unca Joel Walker (I think) asked what everyone's dream bus
trip was.

Well, I posted then how I'd love to drive a vintage bus from Cape to Cairo.
So that's what I'm doing. Leaving around the end of June, I, my partner, and
possibly another friend, will leave for Cape Town and Cape Agulhas, the
southernmost point of Africa, and then through Namibia, Botswana, Zambia,
Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. From there
we intend to make for London, where we will sell the vehicle and fly home.
We might, after Cairo, follow the African Mediterranean coastline through
Libya, Tunisia (Africa's northernmost point), Algeria and Morocco, crossing
to Europe at Gibraltar. In fact, never mind might, I think that's what we'll
do :-) We have given ourselves six months to complete the journey.

A website is to follow shortly, and I'll keep the list updated on my
preparations. Also expect regular trip reports on the site, and updates to
the list.
