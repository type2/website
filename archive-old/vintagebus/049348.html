My wife, Liz, isn't as hearty as us bus drivers, so we're driving the '99 =
Ho*da with the AC to the coast Friday. It'll be 104 here today.=20

Speaking of the DC, I drove it a few miles the body guy's shop yesterday =
to check on the 21w progress, then stopped in for a pint or two at the =
local. On the way home from there it died! Had to push it a long block to =
the driveway. It's burning ignition fuses for some reason. I replaced the =
pertronic dizzy module this morning, no-go. Will replace the pertronix =
coil tonight. Had to pedal my ass to work, 3 miles.=20

I'll look at the seat back from my '65 deluxe that's in the rafters =
tonight. I think they are plastic half-spheres with a chrome/silver =
finish. Maybe the list knows if they're repro'd. Somebody with a lathe =
could turn 'em easily from billit. My father-in-law has a huge industrial =
one that must have a 10' yawn to work on ag pumps.=20

Hi   I was just looking at some pictures on the Type 2
site.You say you are driving a Honda? where is the DC?
Hey do you know if there are any aluminum &quot;caps&quot; or
whatever that go on the ends of the backseat aluminum
rail in my 67 deluxe?  Later...
