Wow ! Those pictures sure  brought back the memories.
When I was a kid, in the late sixties early seventies, my dad worked for VW.
He would have a new bus every year.Westy's of course, and my family
would go on a three week trips .The Grand Canyon one year.
Niagra falls and New England the next year.Florida the next year.
My brother and sister(the rest of my brothers and sisters were too old to
go)
would play &quot;mad libs' in the back. My Mom and Dad would figure out where to
go next.
My Dad never planned a trip, we just went ! Always taking the back roads and
stopping in little towns
at the &quot; home cookin' &quot; diners.
        Now I am going on camping trips with my kids. it's come full circle.


         I now drive splits, but bubbles are ALRIGHT in my book.
