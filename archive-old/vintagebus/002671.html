How do I find out if my buddies 55 SC was originally equipped with
semaphores? All his wiring (and everything else) has been changed. Thanks

&gt; You will have to figure out if your 55 is a USA model or Euro with
&gt; semaphores.  Quite often the semaphores were removed and the holes bondoed
&gt; over or even just bondoed over in thier holes.  USA models have two wires
to
&gt; each tail light for dual filament bulbs.  Euros have only one for single
&gt; filament bulbs.  So to use Euro tail lights in a USA model bus you have to
&gt; buy an extra bulb holder from your FLAPS for each and rig them up for the
&gt; signals.    Eric&amp;Barb
