 Hey speaking of this, is there supposed to be some type of band clamp around 
the dampner and bracket on these.  On all the mufflers I've ever installed 
I've never thought this looked right.  The dampner never fits in the concave 
portion of the bracket.  Have I been installing these wrong?

hmm- maybe.   Good idea to attach all the nuts'bolts loosely, put the clamps 
which is not quite a circle on there, and then snug everything down.
