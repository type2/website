Subject: Rebuilt Gas Tank Available

I have a gas tank from a '65 that was in my '60 double cab.  I had sent
it out and had it cleaned, painted (black) and the interior coated with
a glass like epoxy for sealing gas tanks.  I now have a loaf fuel
injection tank in there to support my 2L CIS FI engine.  I will not be
going back to the 1300/carb engine, so rather than the tank sitting
quietly in storage, I'll make it available.  I spent $75 on the clean up
work, make me an offer I can't refuse.

I'd include the gas cap, but it is nowhere to be found at the moment.

Please reply off list.
