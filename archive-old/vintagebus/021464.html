&lt;&lt; On Ronnie's advice, I used a Brazilian PICT30/31-3 Brosol with the
included adapter on my Mexican engine in my '71 bus.  It worked fine from
the get-go with a .009 distributor.  &lt;Snip&gt;  The tailpipe is running black 
even after a long highway run, so the power loss isn't due to a lean mixture.

Hi George,
Did you try a bigger air correction jet?  Is this on a SP or DP engine?
