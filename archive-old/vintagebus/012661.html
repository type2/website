In the 66 I had nicer darker grey different plastic
handles.  In my 67 the handles are the normal grey,
just like 68-71.  Is this correct.  If it is infact
correct I would be willing to trade some of the nicer
pre67 handles for legitimate 67 handles.  Don't have
my M-code info but I remember doing the numbers and it
was one of the last 15% made.  Also hope to see some
of you all at the BugOn in Monrovia, Md this Saturday.
More than likely I will be in my 86 Golf, sorry have
grad school in the morning and want to maximize the
time.  Additionally, Peek Perfromance in Lanham is
having an open house tommorrow, 10% off regulare
prices. Look for fliers provided by Paul Williamson
concerning the start up of Chesapeake Region Aircooled
Brethren (CRAB), hopefully to become a NEATO/LIMBO
chapter. Thanks for all the suggestions for the gas
guage etc, will fix when the weather gets nicer, also
I seemed to run out my battery because I switched the
light switch on that is on the steering column w/out
knowing what it was and left it on.  I am a dork.
Have a great weekend wish I could go to the campout in
NC!
