Once while in a huge rain storm in hawaii, the wipers went KA-PUT. i could 
still hear the motor running but no wipie-wipie, anyway on to the fix; after 
searching out the problem i realized i had lost the &quot;jesus christ&quot; clip. i 
was able to work the fix by straightening out a safety pin and slipping the 
loopy part over the shaft and into the groove. this held for the rest of the 
bugs life with me.
note: try to dull the sharper end on a rock or something!
luck
