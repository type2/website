I missed the &quot;Sold Out&quot; link right under the Fastback at the bottom at
first, it shows some of the Buses they already sold...  '58 15-window, a few
23s, a lot of mid 50s Buses, damn...

Dan Kinsey's old '53 Kombi is on there, it was for sale a while back and
located in CA.

Check out the parts too, how about $800 for a ribbed front bumper or $1500
for an NOS one?!?

They are definitely confused about what &quot;Beat Up&quot; means.

Oh well, it's cool to see.

Everett
