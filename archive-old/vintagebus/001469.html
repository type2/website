Hello Again

	I was wondering has anyone used the Wolfgang straight axle kit and what
type of transmission did they use with it. I believe I have a bad tranny and
I know I am going to have to rebuild my reduction boxes as well. My bus was
already lowered when I got it and I am not worried about the change in
height.

Thanx
Eric
67 Deluxe bus just trying to move forward it is a challenge!
