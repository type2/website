Subject: Re: [VB] Randar wheels???

It seems to be a prime example of supply and demand.  Since Randy is the only ones reproducing them and just about everyone wants a set, then the price is gonna reflect that demand.  Same thing with repro BRM's a few years ago. When Flat-4 was the only game in town, they were along the same price range.  Now we've got a couple more producers and the prices have dropped significantly.  But on the same hand, you see a buttload more cars sportin' the BRM's now.  They don't look as sweet as they used to.

I do dig the Randars.....I envision myself pimpin' a narrowed beam, straight axle, lowered, ribbed bumpered, double door panel rolling on some Randars...but then again, I've got the 63EZ and another project 65 in the garage.  Someday.........

Get em' and roll that bus they way YOU want to.

&gt; has anyone bought these new repro's of the Empi Raders? i love them and they 
&gt; look great, but i just cant imagine why they are a grand. i wanted them for 
&gt; my birthday, but the wife will laugh when she sees how much they are. 

&gt;
