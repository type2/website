Subject: singlecab side gates at jerome

i've got a pair of side gates for a singlecab that i pulled out of a heap of stuff destined for the junkyard.  i'm willing to give them to anyone who thinks they can use them.  they are pretty bad but i think salvageable.  the hinges are rusted away and there are good sized holes along the length of the bottoms of both gates.  i'll be at jerome and would be glad to drive them out to someone who wants them.  pictures are at:

the pictures aren't as close up as i'd have liked but then we're still learning this digital camera thing.  i did have success with &quot;enlarge the canvas&quot; and &quot;zoom in&quot; when the files were on my hard drive.
