&gt; Tackling an unfamiliar problem with my bus, figuring it out and
&gt; understanding it, and fixing or improving it gives me a great boost in
&gt; my self confidence. I give to her, and she gives back. This alone is
&gt; reason enough for me to own and drive (daily) an old bus!


Well, actually......

you did not touch the king pins.

You did the LINK PINS, which is comparatively easy and cheap.

Try the king pins next time, but read in the manual before you take a go
at it.
