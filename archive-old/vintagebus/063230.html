RANT: I'm done trying to sell vw's on the internet. The more pics I =
take,
the more people ask for. I'm not a professional salesman that does this =
for
a living. I just like to drive a vw for a year then get a different one.
There's a lot of trust (or chance) involved in buying an old car from
someone. It's bad enough even when you get to go look at the car =
extensively
in person, let alone just by digital pictures. I think anyone who buys =
and
sells vw's on the internet is nuts anymore. The next time I want to buy
something from out of state, I'm just going to pick a location, fly =
there
and camp in the classifieds for a weekend. Last time I bought a vw off =
the
samba I got ripped. Yet, my buddy got the deal of the century. It's a
gamble. So I'm done ranting now....selling over the internet is a pain =
in
the ass and most people aren't prepared for it (including me i guess).
