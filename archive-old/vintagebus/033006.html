I have discovered that the front spindles on my '64 Standard (15 Nov '63)
take the bigger central nuts -- the ones that set the wheel bearing
end play along with the lock plate.  I was hoping to change the nuts
out for the later clamp nut type (with Allen screw) but the spindle
diameter is too big.  Does any VW supplier make a clamp nut that fits
the early spindles?  If not, I am thinking (very preliminary) about
seeing if a machine shop could make me some - would there be any
interest in more copies of them from the list?

If you have the 64-67 spindles, the ones that have the handy lip on the dust 
cap to pry it off, the bay window nuts with allen tighteners should fit your 
spindles.  Are you sure you dont have clamp nuts from a bug?   If you have 
the 55-63 spindles, no they will not fit.
