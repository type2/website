I too am considering the LED switch but in a different direction. I found 
some LED stop / taillights that look like they should slip inside of the 
stock housings (58-61). Looks like all that would be needed is to silicone 
them in and hook up the wires. The other reason I'm thinking about going 
this route is that when I put a halogen lamp behind my repro lenses they 
appear amber (somehow me thinks that would be reason enough to get pulled 
over). When I get around to trying this I will report back with my findings.
