Subject: Re: [VB] Front Disc Brake Kit Grease Seals - Unable to Locate

Richard-
Somewhere on that seal is a part # for that seal. It could be stamped on the
inside or outside of the metal or cast into the seal lips. But since you
know what the size is you could try Napa or a local bearing house. They both
have interchange books that give seal demensions(which you have) to find you
the correct seal needed for your hub. If they don't have it in stock and
they order it be sure you take the hub when you p/u the seals and test fit
it in the bore(make sure the seal does not drop in). Then when you get home
test fit it on the spindle. If both fit properly, assemble and your rollin
again.

Bob
