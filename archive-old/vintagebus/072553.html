Subject: Re: [VB] cargo area divider

I have an extra one, but they're  PITA to ship.  I also have a repro
one; someone *was* making them a few years ago.

Too much coffee man wrote:
&gt; A long time ago, I remember seeing a panel van that had a divider between the
&gt; drivers area and the cargo area.  This divider went all the way to the ceiling
&gt; and If I remember correctly had a window in it so one could still see out the
&gt; back.  Was this a stock product?  If so, any ideas on where to get one?  it
&gt; would be for my '58 panel.
