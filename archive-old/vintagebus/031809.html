The way I use to do Porsche's (haven't RESTORED a bus yet) was to ZINC
Chromate all the hidden areas as welding progressed. First step was to
Walnut blast (plastic media melted when welding) the entire vehicle, as
metal was removed for replacement it was Zinc Chromate on any hidden areas
as were the areas of the vehicle being worked on (these were also spot
blasted as cutting progressed). This way I knew for sure that all areas were
treated and wouldn't have to worry about hidden rust in the future. After
completion of the entire vehicle all areas except the exterior body were
zinc chromate, then premiered etc. etc. etc. If you were? coming to BBB V I
could break out a few hundred pictures of these and show you.

Subject: [VB] Restoration Question - Blasting


I'm almost at a crossroads with the '54, and need to make a decision.  I
have almost all of the frame bits (center rails, outriggers, etc) welded
in.  I want to send the entire bus out to be media blasted and primered.  I
am trying to decide whether to send it out when the frame is done, or wait
until I get all the new metal welded in.  FWIW, there is very little rust
left on the car at this point.  Of course there's very little metal left
either...

Pros of sending it now:
* Areas that are exposed, (ie underside of the front floors) would be
exposed and get a proper blasting and painting.
* they charge by the hour; it would be slightly cheaper to not have to
blast the clean new metal
* blasting will remove all the paint and bondo, revealing areas that are
still in need of work that I may not have considered

Pros of waiting:
* all parts will receive same primer treatment
* I'll be at the point where I just start the final bodywork from there

The only other person I knew who had this done did the blasting first, then
sent the car out for the heavy metal work.
