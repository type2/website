&gt; I was wondering if there is a problem towing the bus at highway speeds

speed. As long
&gt; as the trans is in nuetral should there be any problems ? I have to
pick the
&gt; bus up in Virginia and tow it back to Michigan ( 600-650 miles).

You shouldn't have any problem as long as you make sure that the
tranmission stays in neutral.  I've heard of enough folks who ended up
with their transmissons in gear that it might be a good idea to secure
the shift lever in neutral.  

Make sure that the front end is reasonably well aligned and that the
tires are in good shape.  Be sure that you have a usable spare and the
tools to change it (towed vehicles are more prone to picking up nails,
and if the bus has been sitting the tires may be less than optimal).

Keep the speeds down to those natural to buses (60mph or under)

Have a nice trip!
