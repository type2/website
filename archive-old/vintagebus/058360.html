Subject: RE: [VB] 83mm P/Cs

I have a set on my 40hp, the 77's were shot. My 67 motor had 85.5 on it when
I pulled it and they are in good shape. Planning on a light glaze brake and
a new set of rings and putting them on the shelf. The block really had me
confused. Looking at it in the truck it said H08xxxx which told me it was a
1500 for that year of truck. When I pulled it and took it apart, it is a
dual relief case with factory 8mm studs (no case savers) and a 6mm oil
cooler stud with 6mm inserts into the 8mm oil cooler case holes. Except for
the number on the block and the 6mm oil cooler stud I would think it's a
replacement case. I figured at least 10mm head studs. Anyway, the case
turned out good with no need for align bore so I am going to have 8mm case
savers put in, and an 8mm oil cooler stud, sand seal, and punch it for 90.5
cylinders. I'll save the 85.5's for a single relief block, heh heh,
