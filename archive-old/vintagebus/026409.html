I have no comment.
I do not understand.
I expected 200$-250$ tops.
I bet the guy never sends me a check.
I will have a smile when the check actually comes in the mail.
Everett, Im buying you lunch at kelly park.

Money order only!  ;)

Yeah, I don't get it, I was about 99% sure everyone would retract and I would win for $0.06.  I was even going to be cool about it and give you $1, assuming that would include shipping.
