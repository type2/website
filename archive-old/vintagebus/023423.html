Fig,

Your question leaves me a little confused, as you use the word &quot;master&quot; with
the plural of &quot;cylinders&quot;.

I just re-did the front brakes last week, and here is what I can tell you:

  1:  The front wheels each have two _wheel cylinders_ per side.  So, the
entire front has 4 _wheel cylinders_.
  2:  Yes, I believe 1963 and earlier _wheel cylinders_ are different from
1964 and later (I have 1963).
  3:  Bus Depot has description for left &quot;211 611 069 -- Wheel Cylinder,
front left (Bus to '63)&quot;, the right is &quot;211 611 070 -- Wheel Cylinder, Right
Front, 55-63 Bus&quot;.
  4:  There is only one _master cylinder_ -- I have no idea what year is
compatible with what, but this is a single circuit and I just ordered one
for 1963 (anyone know more than I who can discuss interchange of other
years?).

The local VW FLAPS and Bus Depot had German-made ATE _wheel cylinders_ --
they seem well made and worked perfect.

PARTS TIP:  I strongly advise you try to track down at least one of the
&quot;curvy metal lines that runs between the two cylinders, top to bottom&quot; -- I
had a heck of a time getting this off of one wheel cylinder, and the flared
7mm wrench does not fit over it (clearance problems).  I HAVE NOT YET
CONFIRMED, but I believe Bus Depot describes this as &quot;211 611 505B  Brake
line, betw front wheel cyl, 55-70 Bus&quot;....  I will find out when the rest of
my order arrives.  Anyway, you have to remove this metal line to replace
both cylinders, and you would be somewhat screwed if you stripped the end of
it.  Having one on hand would be a good precaution.

Bus Depot is selling the _wheel cylinders_ for $29.95 each ($120 if you are
renewing all 4 on the front), which is $10 cheaper than local VW FLAPS were
asking...

Hope this helps.

Hey Volks

Are the front brake master cylinders interchangeable pre and post 63?
