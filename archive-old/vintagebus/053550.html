Subject: Re: [VB] trailering a bus

I bet the cost of the U-haul set up rivaled the cost of the bus.  Those
guys are spendy!

&gt; I used the double axle UHaul trailer to pull a '59
&gt; Panel from Phoenix, AZ to Muncie, IN (1500+mi)for 4
&gt; days last June, worked fine.  Used one of their trucks
&gt; to pull it, I don't recommend that at all.  The
&gt; trailer, however, worked fine.  The hardest part was
&gt; trying to slowly lower the bus down a hill from a
&gt; Toyota truck while we cranked the bus onto the trailer
&gt; with two come-alongs.  Once it was on, however, it
&gt; stayed fast.  The wheel tie downs up front didn't move
&gt; at all.  The size of the trailer was OK, but the
&gt; wheels were pretty close to the insides of the
&gt; trailer.  I think so long as you get it on well the
&gt; first time, and strap it down tight, you should be OK.
