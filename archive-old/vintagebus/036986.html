oh, I forgot to say, if you replace your main seal, replace the O ring in the 
FW at the same time.   about 10% or less upright motors have stepped cranks &amp; 
stepped crank FWs, which do not have an O ring.   But you probably do have 
the O ring style.  When you have the Flywheel off, look at the rear of it 
(the side that faces the motor).  Look where it fits onto the crank, take a 
little screwdriver and peel that old O ring out, wipe it all clean, and 
install the new one.  Voila &quot;)
