Subject: Thermostats...

Hi all,

Okay, I was going thru a box with a few old used, but good thermostats for my
fleet, and noticed a few slight differences.  Most of mine have a range of
degrees marked on them.  The two ranges I have are:  65 - 70 and 75 - 80.  I
also have one with no markings at all.  Do we have any experts on thermostats
who can breakdown the applications for the various ranges, and maybe point to
any VW literature (VW Parts Manuals, Workshop Manuals, etc.) showing this
stuff?  I seem to remember that the Workshop manuals showed a procedure to
test a thermostat (involves boiling in water and measuring the amount of
extension at a certain water temperature).

I also seem to remember hearing or reading somewhere that the single bolt and
the washer on the underside of the thermostat that attaches it to the bracket
are unique to that application.  Can anyone back that info/rumor up?

Thanks, and stay warm everybody!
