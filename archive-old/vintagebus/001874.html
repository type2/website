Thanks to everyone who replied to our request for info and help..we used
&quot;varsol cleaner&quot; along with brushes and putty scrapper and a lot of &quot;elbow
grease&quot; (grin).
But it finally did come clean enough so that we could get to the changing of
the brake parts.

BTW..I am looking for the lower aluminum molding ...drivers side for a 66
Deluxe in good useable condition, ours has been done away with by PO at some
point.

Thanks again
&quot;sunbuggy&quot;

  Ira
