Subject: Re: [VB] Petronix

Can't speak to a non-FI application but, I ran points on my '71 T3 for 3 or 4 years before going to
the Pertronix. I've never noticed a lag in starting with points or with the Pertronix.

You may be thinking about starting an FI engine that has not been run for a while. In this case, the
fuel pump and fuel lines drain back into the tank and if you just turn the key to start, it takes a
while to build up pressure again before it will start.

Except in the case described above, my T3 with the Pertronix installed cranks immediately when I
turn the key. That isn't the really cool thing though, I like never having to futz with the points.
It seems I was continuously either resetting the points or replacing them.

Even in modern FI electronic ignition cars they take longer to fire up than
a proper points system.
