&lt;&lt;  think the next trend is shorty Buses, I saw a shorty Single Cab pretty
 close to the Ellis' house in Phoenix.  That thing is dope, they even 
shortened
 the treasure chest door.  Slide out gun rack here I come!

Speaking of which, I just swaped a bus I've been trying to sell for a 
shortened 56 single cab. and I do mean shortened. The front and rear jack 
points are only a few inches apart. there is no treasure chest door to speak 
of. Thing is there are no other hacks, correct tail light holes, wheel wells 
there, nice dash, pressed bumpers with no pea shooter holes. Just several 
feet missing from the bed. Oh, and the side gates are welded to the cab. 
watch for pics coming up soon in the vintagebus_dot_com hall of shame.
