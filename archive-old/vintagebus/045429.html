Subject: '61 sundial FS
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Fellow club member Chris Burke is selling his
1961 sundial for sale

Mostly complete but needs interior wood paneling to be replaced or repaired.
Has rust underneath on the cross members.
Almost dent free. Has a few waves along the side panels. The rear wheel wells 
have been replaced at one time by a PO.
1600cc DP runs great except for the fact that when it was built someone did 
not match up the timing marks so its kinda interesting ;) but it does run 
great!!
New tires, electricals are fine, brakes are new.
Just recieved a tune up.

Basically a clean bus that runs well, has 95% of the sundial interior but 
does need some cross members relaplaced from rust damage.

Pictures will be posted this week at http://az4bangerz.vwspeed_dot_com

This isn't my bus but i have molested it plenty!
