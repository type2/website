Subject: Buses On The River

More details to follow soon - but be aware, be
afraid, be there, and be square... the disco ball
is making an appearance.

How many people are already planning on coming to
the shindig??  If you are, please give me an idea
of a head count for your Donner party.  It will
give us some idea of how to plan the food.  We've
been thinking hard about a pig roast since last
years feast, but need to have an estimate of
numbers to size in on the right pork to poke.

The Scoop: (low-fat, no sugar added)
