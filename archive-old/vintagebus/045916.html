&lt;&lt; Hey eric&amp;barb,
  So air is getting in (66deluxe) the master cylinder and if i rebleed my 
brakes after tightening the nut I may be all good?&gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Yes, if the fluid in the reseviour leaks out and the brakes are used sucking 
air into them.

&lt;&lt; Also over torqued my driver front bleeder valve, didn't snap though.  Does 
that wheel cylinder have to be replaced?&gt;&gt;
From your later Email it does sound like you have split that wheel cylnder.

&lt;&lt;  Any options of getting one last bleeding session in?  My PO claimed bus 
had new master, hopefully tightening it will fix problem, just installed 
right rear wheel cylinder the other rear seems bad.  Put new  shoes on the 
rear after fixing axle seal leak.  Rear drums seem properly adjusted.  
Haven't looked inside the front and am having trouble adjusting  them.  Bus 
is running great but won't stop!  Thanks,    Eric   66deluxe &gt;&gt;
Replace that split wheel cylinder,  dissassemble all of the other wheel 
cylinder and polish them out with 400 grit wet/dry sand paper and reassemble 
if they have no pits on the cylinder wall where the piston seal ride.  Take 
apart the MC and make sure it is new.  You are going to trust you life to it! 
 Then replace all of the brake flex lines, adjust the brake shoes properly 
after you make sure the front shoes are in good condition.  Measure all of 
the inside of the drums and only have them turned if they have more than 
.040&quot; taper side to side or are grooved badly.  Refill the MC and bleed 
everything.  Then go through the front suspension and steering  All this is a 
minimum of stuff we would do on any VW we just received before doing any 
driving!  If it is not going to stop or steer properly you and your Vw are 
probably going to be dead meat all too soon.
