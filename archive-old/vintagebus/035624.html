Hi Fred,
The $4,000.00 after discounts for private parties would still be a hunk of 
money to put up for a chance to win the $250,000.00.  From what we see about 
the rules the auto to be entered has to be a pre-1960 race car or motorcycle, 
all other cars must be pre-1951.  So it looks to us that one would have to 
enter a 1950 BD or if you could get VW to release the 49 prototype to you.....
