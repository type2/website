Subject: was Re: [VB] Grrr  Westfakia!  now its two tone westys

Why is it so hard for anyone to accept that this is a
westy? Why is there so many that think its a hack?
Because it has one jaulosie window?? Didnt dormobiles
come with one popout, one stationary, and one
jalousie? You guys never seen two tones westys before?
I don't own the bus, don't live near the bus, never
seen anymore of the bus then what is on the ad, but it
gripes me that everyone thinks its a fake. I thought
we were more educated than that. 
&gt; 
&gt; ya- that bus seems to have an original interior
&gt; there, and carefully doesn't 
&gt; show headliner-   
&gt; 
&gt;  I have heard that once in a rare while westys were
&gt; made from standards,  
&gt; Though it's much more likely that someone hacked in
&gt; a flip top, and installed 
&gt; the kit.  You could buy kits for installing yourself
&gt; back in the day, make 
&gt; your standard a 'westy'.        
&gt;     The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense. 
&gt; Halfway swap over is what it 
&gt; implies.  Seen them w/ 5 (with solid in the closet)
&gt; or with the regular 4 
&gt; solids 2/ popouts, but any mix and match jalousie
&gt; and popout was home grown.
