Hi List, 
It's Friday and here is my update on the San Francisco Trip.

Hats off to San Francisco, a great VW City. Each time I go I see more and more
air cooled daily drivers. Having said that, the really insane are the San
Franciscians who drive all of those hills in their VWs. Jim and I were scared
to death driving LMRC (Late Model Rental Car) up and down Knob Hill and that
had a V-8 and automatic. I couldn't imagine driving either of our VDUBS! Hats
off to San Francisicians you are a brave lot! Not to mention the fact that you
must all be wizards at tranny re-builds and repairing rear-end damage!

On to the show in Pleasanton. It was a nice morning. A small show, IMHO the
vehicles were nothing to write home about. There were only two vehicles that
caught our eye. There  was a neat custom Taxi with a choped taxi trailer made
out of the back half of a bug. There was a stunning restore of a 64 Westie.
Gary LaVere did the body work and paint. I am sure that the list can see the
obvious appeal to me and Jim. We had a great conversation with the owner, He
is VW Phillip_at_aol_dot_com and not a list member we gave him the address of
type2_dot_com hopefully he will join the list I am sure he would be an asset. 

Swaps were O.K. Jim and I checked out some overpriced Swamp Coolers (AC for
Bugs) and Search Light Mirrors (Again for Bugs) passed on both. We picked up a
trim ring for the rear tail light assembly and radio knobs. Nothing else
seemed worth it.

The commercials were OK. Jim met the guys from Wolfgang and checked out their
disk brake conversion. I was dead set against it because I thought that you
had to go with Porsche wheels. Wolfgang assured us that they can do the stock
lug pattern so that we can go with stock wheels. Jim thought that the quality
was good. Has anyone installed the disk brake conversion? We bought some bug
stuf from Koch's. 

We met SOTO and found them to be a nice bunch of people. We had previously not
joined feeling that it was primarily a &quot;West Coast&quot; club. But heck we're on
the West Coast enough so why not? We joined on the spot and even purchased a
way cool SOTO key chain! There was a guy hanging around with SOTO that made
excellent quality Luggage rack locks Jim and I got a set for the Westie rack.
I will post information on how to contact him when we unpack from the trip. He
also made Turned aluminum bud vases. Much more macho than floral ceramic! Oh
well happy Friday!
