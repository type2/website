You have to stretch out the material, clamp it to the glass, lube it up and slide it in.
Stretching it makes it thinner.  After it's in, let it sit a couple days before you trim,
so it can suck some of the rubber in.

&gt; glass in ONE of my vent wing windows.  I bought new rubber gasket 
&gt; material from Wolfsburg West, which seems very thick, and I just 
&gt; cannot make it all come together at once.  I can't even the the glass 
&gt; to seat on the forward edge of the frame.
