Well, the gauge/sender unit is rather simple.

+ into one side of the gauge, the other side goes directly to the sender
lug.  Sender is groundded.  Thats it.  a few wires on the table, and you
should eb able to move the float around by hand to check it out.   move it
to the &quot;full&quot; position, then the &quot;empty&quot; position, and in between.;)


Going to use the 6v gauge with that drop circuit that whatshiname posted?
I'll warn you, output voltage of the simple circuit is a dead steady ~5.6
volts or something like that.  So the gauge always reads low. (ie, when
full, it only hits the top hash mark, instead of pegging out...it just
means when you hit R you still have a few miles more then you normally
would.;)  I'm speaking using the 6v system as a reference, using the same
gauge and sender.;)

g'luck...david
