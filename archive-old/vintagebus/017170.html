  If you have a new hose made, make sure what you are
getting.  Most hydraulic places can make this stuff up.  It's not cheap. I
just paid about $175 for four hoses



Thanks for the info. on further investigation I don't think It is the end 
that is leaking. I think something must have gotten between these two very 
rigid hoses and worn a hole through. I talked to a farm machinery place and 
he said about $12 a hose....YOu heard me right. $4 for the ends and $2 a 
foot for 3000 lb hydrolic hoses. Thanks again.
