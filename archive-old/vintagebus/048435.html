Subject: H4 Halogens on a Splitty.

Yes, Yes, Yes. IT is the only way to go. I run them on all of my cars. I
believe they even make 6 volt bulbs for them but I am not sure. In my 60
Crew Cab I run H4's with 90/130 bulbs in them. It is really nice to be able
to see very clearly. I have stock wiring with an aftermarket alternator on
the motor, but I do not use any relays or special wires. You could probably
get them a little brighter with relays. The stock H4's come with 55/60's in
them usually. If you trade them out for the brighter bulbs when you buy
them you can usually get some trade in value. The one downside to the
brighter bulbs is they do not seem to last as long. I still get about 2 to
3 years out of them. I do aim my lights just a touch lower with the big
bulbs so as not to blind on coming vehicles. With them aimed lower no one
seems to even notice.
Hope this helps,
