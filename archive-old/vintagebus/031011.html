**So Long, and Thanks For All the Laughs** -- Don't panic! Noted
  British humorist and Macintosh proponent Douglas Adams died
  unexpectedly from a heart attack at a gym near his California home
  last Friday. He was 49 years old. Among his many proclivities (he
  had built barns, worked as a bodyguard, and played guitar with the
  rock band Pink Floyd), Adams wrote the classic Hitchhiker's Guide
  to the Galaxy series, which began as a BBC radio serial and also
  spawned graphic novels, record albums, a play, a computer game,
  and a television series. Adams had been recently working on a
  feature film adaptation of Hitchhiker's for Disney. Although Adams
  didn't try to write predictive science fiction, his works
  engendered a surprising collection of Internet and pop culture
  terminology (such as the name of AltaVista's BabelFish
  translation service), and his fictional Guide - envisioned
  long before the Web - could be described as a galaxy-wide
  online collaboration system. Tributes from friends and fans
  are being collected at Adams' Web site. [GD]
