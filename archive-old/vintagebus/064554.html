Subject: Re: [VB] Heater cable, transmission questions

1) Make sure the seams are pointing 45* way from straight up.

2) the bands around the endscould be too loose. (try tightening them up)

3) the screws at the seam could be too tight- you dont want to squish the 
seam open in between them.

4) I tend to use sealer around the boot seam and when the boot wraps the axle 
tube (leg?)  attache seam lightley, then the big end have to push the 
bootthat way a bit, then the small end last.  make sure the bands and the 
boots are atatched properly.

You should be able to shine a light and see where the leak is coming from

 Also I changed fluid in my transmission last week (thanks Matt for the
 directions) and now I have a leak coming from around my boots, I was
 going to check the level anyway and maybe change the fluid again to see
 if any more metal would come out of the old girl (and it may just be to
 full) but I was curious if anyone has stopped any leaks around that area
 and short of tearing it all apart what is the best way?
