Subject: Re: [VB] Need help with Tiger 581 CDI

&gt;From: &quot;Thomas Ainlay&quot; &lt;tainlay_at_sbcglobal_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I installed a Tiger 581 CDI and when I ran the vehicle the points wire
&gt;overheated and the points fried.

The directions on their Web site are for the 681 model, which seems to
use a separate magnetic pickup instead of the points.  But most of the
wire colors seem to be the same:
 
&gt;White wire from CDI to + on coil

OK

&gt;Black wire from CDI to - on coil

The only black wires they talk about are grounds.  If this is a ground,
and it's connected to the other ground wire, then this could be the
problem.  Try disconnecting this wire altogether and see what happens.
 
&gt;Red wire from CDI to a contact strip with: 12V from ign. on, 12V feed to
&gt;electric fuel pump, idle cutoff valve and choke element

OK

&gt;Green wire from CDI to points

OK.  The points should also probably still be connected to the -
terminal on the coil.

&gt;Extra black wire with ring terminal from CDI to battery ground

Probably OK

The only wires you should have at the coil are the white wire from
the CDI (on +) and the wire to the points and the CDI (on -).
