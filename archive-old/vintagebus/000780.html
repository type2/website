 My '55 SC is coming right along... today I installed a brand new carb from
 my collection, along with a timing adjustment, filter change, breather
 cleaning..etc.
 I loaded all my tools and rode off into the sunset for another adventure.
 Ended up going about 40 miles down the coast on a really cool stretch of
 A1A. Also drove down some oyster shell roads leading past an old plantation
 with slave quarter ruins... really spooky, as it was very dark.
 Here's my problem:
 The transmission is in need of attention.. the gear shift basically moves in
 circles and gears don't really sink into any notch. I was able to locate
 gears and drive ok, but now I'm starting to have a big problem with reverse.
 Had to push the truck backwards once tonight after trying reserve for about
 twenty minutes. When I got home, I tried reverse and got it right away. I
 decided to try 1st gear and move forward to try again.. Then 1st was really
 hard to find! Finally sunk 1st moved forward and reverse wasn't located once
 again. I ended up leaving the truck tonight in hopes someone can tell me
 which parts I need and how to adjust?
 Thanks guys.

do you have a tunnel case or split case tranny?  In the split case trannies 
the trans has two halves, you can see the seam just like in the motor. This 
tranny was installed in buses through may 59, though many of those buses have 
been retrofitted with tunnel case trannies.   Anyway, in the split case 
trannies, 1st and reverse have straight cut gears, so you need to be at a 
full and complete stop before putting the bus in gear or it will grind and 
complain, unless you luckily mesh the gears.     And yes, if the teeth don't 
want to line up, it will not go into gear.  I got in the habit of shifting 
into 2nd, then into 1st when I had my early 59 with split case tranny.  This 
can also happen with reverse, so try shifting into another gear before 
reverse.  This is just because of the way the teeth are, not a problem.  I 
mean there could be a problem, but this also happens with perfectly good 
split case trannies, but moving the shifter will bump the teeth slightly so 
things line up. 

also, do check to make sure your transaxle boots are good, no tears or 
cracks, and have you changed your gear oil lately?   Extends the life of your 
tranny and improves shifting to do so.  If the old oil is really dirty and/ 
or has grit in it I would change the oil again in a few hundred miles.  I 
like the slick 50 gear oil, but use the regular stuff for the first change.   
Change gear oil immediate after driving, so it is warm and stirred up.   Do 
RGBoxes and center section at same session, as they are interconnected.
