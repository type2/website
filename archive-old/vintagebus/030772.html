There is almost nothing...I repeat...nothing that people in air cooled engine building agree on. I talked to everyone on topics ranging from what oil temps are safe, compression ratios etc... and they all had a wild range of answers v. The one thing that everyone said is don't use
anything bigger than the 90.5's in a bus. Some even prefer to go with the 88's ( I don't know if these are still available anymore). When people actually agree about something about air cooled engines I usually listen. There are a lot of people on this list who can give you the technical
reasons why the 92's would be that much worse. You state that .059&quot; is not all that much difference but it is all relative. If a bearing is already on the tight side and then it gets .059&quot; tighter then that is a huge figure. The same with the air cooled motor. It is already built a little
on the edge at 1600 but there is some room for pushing it, the 90.5's are that much closer to the line and at some point you just get too thin. Primarily you list dependability and good traveling power as your main goals, not trying to go as fast as you can for a little while on as little
money as possible. If you want more reliable power than stroke it.

I had a stock dog house set up on my 2110. I had a modified Mazda RX7 oil cooler to go on but I was trying to work out the temp problems before putting a band-aid on the problem. I agree with Adrian. Once you put on the full flow it is easy to add on a cooler later if you need it. I have
a set up on my Thing that the previous owner put on that has an external oil cooler with thermostat and fan that is really nice. For my Double Cab I have put on the type IV oil cooler and gone that route. It takes less oil line and extra parts. The other thing to remember is that your
motor is AIR cooled. What I mean by this is if your oil is getting too hot, just cooling your oil is only going to help your head temps a little. I would love to see a test on this. Have someone actually see if an oil cooler and deep sump really lowered cylinder head temp by very much. If
your head temps go through the roof but you have enough oil cooling to keep your oil cool you are still going to see longevity isssues. I am not the most technically knowlegeable person to be answering your questions but hopefully some of these things will give you more questions to ask
those who are. There is probably a good reason why you do not see very many 1835's out there. And keep in mind that the engine to push a loaded bus across country will be very different than the engine built to push a bug to a fast quarter mile.

hope some of this rambling helps,
