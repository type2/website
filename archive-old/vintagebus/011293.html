Hi Craig,
We have found for the single relief engine cases oil pressures in warm/hot 
weather of 12 at idle and 20 at about 3,000 RPM.  Dual relief engine cases 
tend to function at 30 at idle and 40+ at about 3,000 RPM.  As for oil temp 
we like to keep it between 180F and 210F with 230F as the whoa time to slow 
down or pull over mark.  Have heard that some of VDO gauges are now being 
made in S. Pacific country and are supposed to be not too good.  We as of yet 
only use 1970s thru 1980s used  German gauges from water cooled VWs with new 
senders which seem so far to be very accurate.
