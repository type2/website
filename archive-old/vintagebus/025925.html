Thank god it was just a nasty late-model!  Whew!  No loss there.. you had me
scared for a sec by posting it to the vintage list!

Replacing fuel lines aside, you're truly an arse if you're out driving around
without at least one big fatty fire extinguisher!  I've got mine mounted on
the bulkhead right next to the drivers seat in my bus...  jump out, grab the
extinguisher, go for it! 

Intresting factoid:  In most civilised countries (besides the US of course)
it is illegal to sell and or drive a motor vehicle without some sort of fire
extinguisher.  Also, if you've ever noticed the little compartment in the back
seat deck of a Mercedes, it's there for a 1st Aid kit, because in Germany, if
you see a wreck, you are obligated to render assistance and 1st Aid on anybody
who may need it.

&gt;If you're still not sold on replacing those fuel lines every few years (and

&gt;if you're brave), check out this picture:

&gt;Anyone know whose bus this was?  It is burning at an Ultramar station (yes,

&gt;I work for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock) so is probably in California.
