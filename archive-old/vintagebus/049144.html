List:

Is anyone north of Santa Barbara planning on attending Familienfest this weekend?  JP from Arizona is bringing out a gas tank for me, but since my wife is outta town this weekend I home with the kids all weekend.  I was hoping if someone were going they could grab the gas tank for me and drop it off on their way back up the coast.  I could even pile the kids in the car for a short rendezvous somewhere.

TIA.

Robert
