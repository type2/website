 1.  Check April 2001 Hot VW's page 87 lower left. I do have vintage buses.

 1a. So as to not offend to many of you, this 62 singlecab was a rusty
basket case to start with and will take about a year to complete, It's been
kicking around Havasu for about 12 years and no one wanted it, but is a
great chance to get in more panel replacement practice.

 2.  Finished tacking on both 1/4 panels on the  single cab. They came from
Alan Scofield by way of Ronnie and took about 1 hour to remove each old
panel and tack on new. Had to trim both panels a little to fit. Looks like
Alan makes them a little large to be universal fit. Both went from treasure
door to louvers. Left out gas door panel and will make neck to fill from
inside side door.

 2a. Put 2nd coat of filler on the 3&quot; chop top and reshaped the rear window
frame, top had to be cut into 5 pieces to do it right, filled in rear
taillight holes with custom VW logo panels, working on recessed Volkswagen
script logo brakelight panel and started to fill in recessed areas on gates
to smooth them out

 3. All you that are afraid to jump into major metal work, DON'T BE. Buy a
decent wire welder, a grinder, hammer, punch, chisel. drill and go for it.
You will pay for the tools the first time you use the stuff.

 4. Got the 914 seats and started to make mounts and custom center console.

 5. Checking local junkyards for a digital dash that can be adapted, Dakato
pickup looks good.

 5a. Just to see if you vintage types are reading this, I am removing the
stock treasure chest spare tire mount brkts and will ups to the 1st emailer
who wants them for $10.00 shipping included. The tow bar looking tire rack
is gone, will send the stud, large wingnut, and 2  three step slotted brkts.

 5b. This is going to be a match racer for Kyles rides.

 6. Stick with it S.G. hope you and Kristen  did not get to shook up, up
there.

 See ya in Tucson end of the month with the 63 panel. Hope you're ready for
us DeDe and Kyle.
