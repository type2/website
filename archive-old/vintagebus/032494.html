&lt;&lt; Why did VW decide that the thermostats were unnecessary in mexico???
 Its not ALWAYS 80+.&gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Well VW is getting rid of the bug and it's engine slowly, but very surely.
Parts cost money and the age of the reliable and well built bug are long gone.
Plus since the temps in Mexico are going to be more in the 80+ than lower this
means that they save $ by not making the part, not drilling, threading, and
inserting a stud and not installing the part and all of the flaps system.
Bear's VW machine of San Diego rebuilds engines and are one of the few places
we trust with our lives.  In thier attempt to keep up with demands for thier
work they are constantly looking for rebuildable engine cases.  So they
recently looked just to thier south for good used engine cases and found that
the fuel in Mexico is so bad it denotates all of the time even with the low
compression.  Thusly the main bearing area in the case ends up so badly
pounded from this problem that it is impossible to rebuild these cases without
welding the case in this area.  Which at this time is not financially feasible
since it would add about another $50.00 to each engine case.  Eric &amp; Barb
