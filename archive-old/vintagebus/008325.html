  -----------------------------------------
I thought I joined a mailing list
&gt; about vintage VW buses.  But lately, the mail on this list concerning
e-bay
&gt; way outnumbers the mail about vintage buses.  This conversation has come
up
&gt; before and it has been suggested that whoever doesn't want to hear about
&gt; e-bay crap can just hit the delete key.  Anymore, it would seem to be more
&gt; practical to &quot;select all&quot; and delete.
