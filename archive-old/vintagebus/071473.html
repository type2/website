Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Bumper color

I owned a '66 Deluse Sea Blue/Cloud White a few years ago and the bumpers
were
painted the Cloud White. Wear and tear on body paint matched bumpers and was
factory original.

Scott
'67 Westy

&gt; I've 'heard' that all bumpers were painted L82, but I can see on my
bumpers,
&gt; that under the chipped paint that the PO sprayed on years earlier, that
&gt; there is the same L289 (BlueWhite) paint on the bumper as the upper color
on
&gt; the body of my bus.
