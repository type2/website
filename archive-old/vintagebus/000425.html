&lt;&lt; Are yall talkin about those muffler lookin things that go from the heater 
boxes to the Y tube?&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Yes!

&lt;&gt;
Yes, before the muffler pieces there were steel flex tubes with fiber glass 
cloth, and vinyl covers over these for insulation.

&lt;&lt; did the &quot;muffler&quot; attach to the heater box or to the Y tube? &gt;&gt;
Y tube.   Eric&amp;Barb
