Subject: RE: [VB] lubricating front door

I took the door panels off, sprayed lube on the door rollers, and put some
grease on the face of the roller...still no go.

  Could the rollers on your door stops be sticking? Takes a little extra
ooumph on the container van to close the doors till I lubed the rollers good

Subject: [VB] lubricating front door


My passenger side door has seemed hard to close for a while now, as though
it is not lubricated properly, but I have lubricated it all I can, I pulled
the door panel off, and it appears as though the lower hinge -the plate that
actually passes through the door-appears to be rubbing, but it is slatehred
in grease-i put on last year...

any ideas on why this would be acting up. it has been doing this for months,
but  I never figured any cause, and I have lubricated the hinges...
