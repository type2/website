Subject: Front Turn Signals 62-67

I have some spending money and would like to secure some NOS or VERY nice
front turn signal lenses, &quot;Fried Eggs&quot; for the 64 Single Cab.

If you have some and would like to sell please drop me a line.

Any one boght the ones ISP West shows on ebay? It suppose to be a close repo
with the Hella Logo? Comments?

Thanks

Meredith
