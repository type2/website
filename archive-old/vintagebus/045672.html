Hi Bob,
Our's was installed by the dealer just between the steering wheel and the 
left rear corner of the ash tray.  Not a good place to have it!  If something 
is plugged into it the driver risks having the cord get caught by thier 
fingers while steering.  Really wish it was just to the right of the head 
light switch instead.
