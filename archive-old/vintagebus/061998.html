Subject: '59 bus home in the UK!!!!!

Thought the list might enjoy this. This is the guy from the UK who bought 
my bus and drove it across the US before shipping it home. Hope you enjoy it.

Hi rex.
What a blast !!! Man I had the coolest time in the US. Apparently, so the 
girls tell me, my accent is 'Kick Ass' !! Whooo !
seriously, thanks for everything. I only had 3 'break downs' in 2,680 miles.
1. The top pulley (on the generator) broke. I had stopped to check out a 
pawn shop for a guitar and noticed a nasty engine rattle..... the center of 
the pulley had sheared ! I found a guy who welded the center back in place 
good enough to use. With this all refitted I looked for a VW on the road 
.... In about 2 miles, BINGO ! a 60's bug. I traced the owner to the 
journal office where she worked and her father had an old pulley that I 
bought and fitted for $10. Its still fitted right now !
2. A tad more serious this time. Brake failure !!!! I sailed through a 
junction, but no collision ! Phew! Now it was the turn of AIRS ... A real 
nice guy Steve Pryble came to my rescue. stayed at his place for 2 days 
until the local 'Foreign Car Parts' came good with a wheel cylinder. 
Rebuilt and back on the road !
3. You know what the 3rd one was ? well it just wouldnt start, and the 
battery was getting more and more flat..... pulled a spark plug ... scratch 
head ... I had knocked the FUEL PUMP SWITCH !!!!!!!!!!
So, bar these small dramas, she ran like a dream. Congratulations on the 
engine build, it goes like magic. I rode at 55 but i reckon I could pull 
70+ when im back here in UK and have good brakes !
Now it should be on the 'Jingu Maru' !! thats the name of the ship ! - I 
think I might call the bus Jingu ... kind cool eh ?&gt;
Oh, by the way I picked up a 1962 P Bass re-issue for $369 !! ( do you know 
where I can find where it was made and what year ? the serial number is 
VO71910. I have a book that suggests 1982 USA.)
I will send you photos as soon as i get them scanned in ...
Dean
