   Is our beloved Vintagebus list dying?  There seems to be less and less
messages, very few road trip stories and there seems to be little if any
good conflicts going on. Very little tech advice and questions seem to be
few and far between. Either everyone is to busy or all of our buses are
running great. It's sad to see the bay window list out do us  and don't even
look at the Vanagon list, 200 plus a day.

Ronnie  just wondering if anybody is still out there.
