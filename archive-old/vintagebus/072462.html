You're a cheery little soul, Stan ;o)
Save yourself $320 and hum a tune.
If you've got friends along I've got a game for you as
well.
Pick a word, like for instance &quot;baby&quot;, and each person
in the bus has to think of songs with that word in it.
You go round the bus until people run out of songs
they can remember and the person who is last wins.
Then they pick another word &amp; start again.
Much better than &quot;eye-spy&quot; and you end up singing half
the time anyway just to prove that the word is in the
song you just stated.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
