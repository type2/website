&gt; I was wondering what the reputation of Vintage Parts
&gt;In CA is. I have spoken through email and it was

&gt; I am trying to look at this from a buisness point of
&gt;view as my wife is eyeing a VW they have for sale And
&gt;I am eyeing some parts for several projects. I live on
&gt;the east coast and have to take them at their word.
&gt;Every thing on the web site looks clearly defined but
&gt;I have been misled before. Just trying to be
&gt;careful....

Now, do you mean Vintage Parts Inc down in SoCal or do you mean Vintage 
Warehouse up in NorCal?  If you mean the latter, I've always had good 
experiences with them.  Greg really knows his stuff and hasn't steered me 
wrong before.
