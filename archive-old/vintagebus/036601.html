Subject: Re: WHEEL WELL FOR A 57 SINGLECAB
To: taylorvw_at_redshift_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 HI EVERYBODY,
     DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET AN INNER WHEEL WELL (PASS SIDE) FOR MY 
57 SINGLE CAB?  I'VE TRIED THE USUAL CHANNELS AND SOURCES, BUT NO LUCK, ALSO 
ANY LEADS FOR A CANOPY FRAME? (I FOUND A PLACE THAT MAKES THE TARP PART)
     ANY HELP WOULD BE GRATEFULLY APPRECIATED.  ITS IN THE SHOP AND AWAITING 
THE PARTS,  AND HOPEFULLY I CAN HAVE IT GOING BEFORE THE SUMMERS OUT.  I'LL 
KEEP EVERYONE POSTED ON ITS PROGRESS
                                                                 THANKS
                                                                  STEVE
