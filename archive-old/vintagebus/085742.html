Subject: Seat screws etc.

Hey all,

I have two front seats that I am putting together, for a 65 bus, and
basically all I have are frames and some padding, and skins. Does
anyone know the size of the screws I need to put the driver side
together? I looked on the parts list but it didn't specify what size
they are, at least I could find it.

Also, how does the passenger seat attach? Does it hook together at all
or just sit in place? what kind of hardware or bumpers or ?? am I
gonna need?

I am putting a bus back together from scratch and I have nothing as a
reference, and since I am hunting for parts used, they don't usually
come complete. So any help I can get in this area would be great as I
am hoping to be able to put around in her this weekend after three
plus years of finding parts and piecing her back together.
