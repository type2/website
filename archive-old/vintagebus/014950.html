Stephen,
       I shot almost a whole roll of film on this bus this past fall.  I was 
just reviewing them last night, how odd it turns up the next day on the 
list.  This bus is owned by Daryl Adams formerly of West Palm Beach, Fla, 
now I believe he is in Colorado.  Never met Daryll, but I have seen many of 
his rare former VW's.  I had heard at one time he was trying to get close to 
$20,000 for it.  The bus is pretty complete, 9/54 stamped 16&quot; wheels, 
semaphores, wood camping interior, has 40horse or later motor, correct gas 
tank, all gauges +1extra i believe, an aftermarket Tach. , Telefunken Radio, 
not sure what tranny style is in it, also has correct tailights plus some 
crazy beehive style reverse lights.  The rear wheel wells are flared, what 
were they thinking?  Also it has a crazy paint job, the color's are Royal 
blue, silver and white.  If there was supposed to be a spare tire try in the 
engine compartment, it is no longer there.
    When I was there I asked Joe ?, who is the new owner ? of Adams VW parts 
in West Palm Beach, how much Daryll was asking.  He couldn't give me an 
answer.  Even called back a week later, he still didn't know.
      What I would give to own a Barndoor.  I am getting closer though in 
years past.  My first bus was a '65 then '64, then '66 then a '58, currently 
a '56.  I hope whoever puchases this bus will drive it, and drive it to 
shows.  Here in Florida there are only two barndoors that ever attend shows. 
  Dave Easterwood drove down his '54? Kombi for Bulli Brigade '99, which was 
cool.  Also Mark Rafferty? had his awesome Barndoor 23 window  bus there. 
This bus is sweet.  I'm more of a vintage purist, but his bus looked good 
lowered and sporting Rader wheels.  To each their own.
