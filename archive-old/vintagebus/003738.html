Thank you for your interpretation, but I was not in question as to what it
meant. The original phrase of acronyms that Taylor was translating contained
the letters OG. He translated it as original, which fits into the rough
definition, but the letters OG stand for Original Gansta. This is all my
response was addressing. Since we are on to definitions, the term comes from
the hip-hop crowd. For instance, when a Latino dresses in khakis with a
rolled up undershirt and a wide headband on his head, that is OG. As in how
the original gangsters dressed in the days when Cheech &amp; Chong movies were
new. It is also loosely used to describe virtually anything that came from
before 1980 after which the bulk of the hip hop crowd was born. It is
certainly not limited to Latino culture, I just don't think it is necessary
to illustrate with multiple examples. It is fairly safe to say that original
paint or parts would be OG, but so would a root beer brown panel with cut
wheel wells, shag carpeting, and little heart shaped moon windows in the
rear (obligatory bus content), as in what was around when the original
ganstas were in their heyday. I expect that people understand what is meant
when someone says OG paint, but that wasn't what my reply was referencing.
