I have a wrecked super beetle with brand new tires on it. They are the 15 in
stock 4 lug wheels. My bus has the 14in 5 lug wheels. I would really like
the new tires on my bus since my funds are limited right now. Can I get 4
lug drums that fit the bus and take beetle rims? Or do I need to try to get
15 in bus rims. Changing drums would be the easiest it seems but Im not sure
if it works. I know beetle drums are too small. How hard is it to find the
15 in bus rims? HELP!
