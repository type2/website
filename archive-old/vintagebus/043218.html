Installed a new 1600DP from Pozzi's in Sac over the weekend in my Westy.
Dual carbs, CW crank, full-flow.  What a machine.  Fabulous power, I was
not expecting such an improvement.  The guy's at Pozzi's appear to be the
real thing, they are very helpful and appear to do excellent work. 
My question is this:  In my haste to get it running (daily driver
syndrome), I ran the 1/2 inch lines across 3-4 air outlet, then up through
existing 2 inch hole (used for gas heater) to filter mounted inside engine
compartment.  I am nervous about running these lines in path of hot air.
A 40 mile freeway drive today showed temps around 210-220 (dipstick
sender), and 45 psi oil.  The numbers look OK, but am I courting trouble?
I checked the archives but came up with zilch.

Thanks again,
Don
