There was a pretty healthy turnout, seems like it grew a lot from last
year and not many waterpumpers really. Lots of Beetles and Later Busses,
quite a few splits and a smattering of other vdubs. Really nothing
unusual but a nice show just the same. I have pix of most of the busses
and a few unusual others.

I was hoping to hook up with a few listees at least but missed somehow.
If anyone sees their bus in the pix please email me.
Im going to try to get to Jax 4/21-22 with me luck.
cheers.

Sorry SF folks if you get the message 2x but I really didn't have anything
'private' this time.

PS I have updated a lot of my personal pages so if youre into that sort of
thing.
