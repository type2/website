&lt;&lt;  I have both rear axles down to the outer ball bearing.&gt;&gt;
Hi Bill,
Lower outer bearing.  Correct?
 
&lt;&lt;1. How are these bearings removed? Both are FAG 6306.C3, right has normal(?)
 cage (room to get between the balls) while the left has a double concentric 
ring, leaving no room. Must get then off to get into the redux boxes for 
inspection.&gt;&gt;
  Well if you do not have the proper bearing removal tool.  Then install the 
17mm allen wrench into the reduction drain plugs one at a time so you can 
hammer on the allen wrench sideways to push off the outer reduction box half. 
 Just make sure to try to go from top to bottom plug often to get off the 
reduction half off as evenly as possible, and this will inturn push off the 
outer lower bearing on the 1955-63 buses.
   Once you have the bearings off of all of thier axles.  You should lightly 
polish the areas where the bearings press on each surface with 400 or higher 
grit sand paper to remove any dings, or scratches to allow the bearings 
easier on/off access.

&lt;&lt;2. It has an early (211 501 615 A) drum on the right (appears new) while 
the left is later (211 501 615 A with a D just under the A)&gt;&gt;
The one with the &quot;D&quot; is most likely the M215 1963 only drum.  We could us 
that if you need an earlier 3/4 ton drum.
 
&lt;&lt;3. On both sides the castellated nuts were finger tight.&gt;&gt;
Surprise!
 
&lt;&lt;4. The right side ball bearing was not seated, allowing ~1/4 in play and
 probably making it too long, also.&gt;&gt;
Fun, fun, fun!
 
&lt;&lt;5. Both outer covers for the redux boxes are the same and early, 211 501
 215B.&gt;&gt;
Those are not correct for the M215, but the 1955-63 style.
 
&lt;&lt;6. The oil deflector and washers under the bearing cover is a mish mash, 
extra washers, ect. Will have to figure correct parts and sequence (which 
drawing).&gt;&gt;
Lovely!  You will really need the shop manual to straighten this mess out.
 
&lt;&lt;7. There is not a gasket in the right box, just sealer.&gt;&gt;
That will work in a pinch, but gaskets are just better to have there.
 
&lt;&lt;8. Parts list to start includes seals (have to remove washer behind the oil
 deflector), redux box gaskets, at least 2 of the grade 10 bolts holding the
 redux boxes to the spring plates (missing), brake springs and horse shoe clip
 and who knows what else.
 
 9. Have no idea what I will find inside the boxes, looks like both stub axles
 may be too long or ???
 
 I will never take on someone's partially done project again, I may even have
 that tattooed on my forehead.&gt;&gt;
At least this should teach you to never trust any &quot;Joe Blow's&quot; work!
 
&lt;&lt;Sorry this is so long, but I have never seen stuff like this and this is 
also
 my first splittie!  &gt;&gt;
No problem, keep swinging at it.  Just take your time, and do it right.
