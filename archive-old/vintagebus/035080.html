Subject: Re: [VB] Wierd redux plugs?
To: wades_wagens_at_uswest_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The outey 19mm plugs were used on split case trannys..    The fill plug is 
also on the other side of the trans, which confused me when I first tried to 
put oil in a tunnel case trans.

the axles/RGBoxes/gears are interchangable for the 3/55 through 63 little nut 
1.39 redux , whether they were from a splitcase bus or later bus.

I like having magnetic plugs in the bottom of the RGBox, though.

 Hey list,
 I have a spare 36mm small nut tranny I was pullin parts off of including a
 Redux box half, and I noticed it had 19mm bolt head fill plugs. Not a big
 deal but not the typicall 17mm *allen* head bolts I'm used to. so the Q is,
 Is this from a different year (splitcase?),  or is it a 63 only 1 ton redux
 half ? I know its a 36mm tranny, but i just want to make sure this half will
 be ok to use. both sides top and bottom have this plug.

 Dont even know if you can fit a 63 redux half on an earlier tranny, but i
 wanted to make sure.
