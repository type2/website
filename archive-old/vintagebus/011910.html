Hi Volks,

I want to thank everyone who offered their ideas and any old parts lying
around taking up space.  I am getting very itchy to start on this VW
podium.  It will be a couple weeks til I recover from knee surgury.  My
(ACL) wasnt attached at all and I also had a couple of cartlige tears.  The
Doc said I did well and it's about a 6 month turn around period before I am
out running on the fields with my teams (BUMMER)  As soon as I get some
flexibility, I will be working on the new project for my classroom and
Sparky.  I will keep you all informed of my VW progress.  Thanks again.

Jamie
