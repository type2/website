I recently purchased my '64 and I cannot get it into reverse when it's cold 
(without major grinding).  After driving for at least 15 minutes I can work 
reverse, if I'm really careful. 
Hi Jim,
We had the same problem with both first and reverse when the VW was cold.  
Turned out the FW seal was allowing just enough oil by it to get just a bit of 
oil on the clutch disc, but not enough to make it slip.  So when cold the 
clutch disc would suction cup to the FW, and when it warmed up the oil on the 
clutch disc would not be so thick and not suction so bad.  We replaced the FW seal 
and took a sharp drill bit in hand and scratched up the area of the FW that 
contacts the clutch disc to prevent this suction cup action in the future.
