...and then we'll start again.

Hey all,

I've been pretty quiet on the list lately, but things have been busy in my 
neck of the woods.  Got married last Saturday to an awesome gal...some of 
you who came to BYOB had the chance to meet her...I am so thrilled to be 
married now.  But this Saturday we leave for 11 days in Maui...and I know 
what kind of traffic this list can generate in 11 days!  So for that time I 
will be signing off...no one will really notice, but I'll be resubbing by 
the 10th of August.

Be safe out on the roads, give your bus a wash and a hug!

-Taylor
