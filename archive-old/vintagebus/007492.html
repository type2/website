Well I certainly hope that when I post finds or about trips that no one
thinks I'm doing in a spirit of bragging or to make others envious.  I like
reading about other's road trips and have even made notes on places that
would be worth traveling to.  You know, places that aren't on a map or have
a big advertising budget but are nonetheless, and entertaining part of
Americana.

I for one would like to say to keep the trip reports comin'...
