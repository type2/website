Subject: Barndoor front shocks
Message-ID: &lt;3A792BE2_at_dog_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

I received the following information about replacement Barndoor front shocks 
from Everett.  Maybe this will be of some help to others on the list.



Brand:             Monroe
Part #:            LE100002
Compressed Length: 8.5&quot;
Extended length:   12.875&quot;
Eye size:          5/8&quot;
Color:             Black

This stock is in their &quot;Limited Edition&quot; line so it normally must be
ordered.  My local Kragen/Checkers warehouse parts store just happened to
have 3 sets in stock.

It is a normal eye-to-eye style and did not come with bushings to drop the
eye size of 5/8&quot; down to 1/2&quot; (M12).  I was unable to find these bushings at
the Hardware store but found them at my local Fly 'N' Hi jacked-up truck
parts house.  Or reuse your old metal bushings, if possible.

&gt; Ask everett, as a matter of fact, i will send this to him also.  i bought
some
&gt; from everett that he got at NAPA.  hey everett, what size were they???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Hey. I'm still having a hard time trying to find the fronts. The guys at
&gt; &gt;any shop down here don't know what I'm talking about. I measured the
&gt; &gt;distance and when installed it is 10 inches between each mount. So you
&gt; &gt;have any more ideas?
