We use Koch's exclusively to restore all the steering wheels for our
restorations. I used to restore them myself, but it took me about 10 hrs
per wheel plus materials. The were a lot of work!

We have bought a lot of them and never had a problem. It doesn't bother
me if I get back  my wheel I sent him or not. Just as long as it arrives
perfect. I just got two more at the Sacramento (sicko hot and muggy)
show. Boxed nicely and restored perfectly as ordered. One in beautiful
Silver/Biege, and the other flawless black, both with matching horn
buttons.
