Subject: Re: [VB] expanding gas tank

Hi Kevin,
Actually overfilling these spare tire tanks to take out dents with gasolene 
is safer than with water!  As long as one takes care of what they are doing and 
checks the tank often while it heats up outside not in a building.  Even if 
the tank splits open or leaks the fuel will not ignite unless one adds a 
ignition source.  To put any sealed container with water on a heating source to 
create a boiling of the water and steam expand/pushing out the dent would be very 
more likely to explode violently enough to kill anyone nearby!
