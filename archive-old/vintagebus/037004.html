Hi David,
Good job!  Make sure that the outlet openings in the caps that go over the 
large ends of the link pins are open and not clogged.  Most old buses we have 
gotten have had this problem and this does not allow the old grease to exit 
both ends and builds up both dirt and water until it destroyes that end of 
the link pin.  As always make sure to have the front end jacked up till at 
least the front wheels are just off of the ground.  Then and only then use 
the grease gun on the joints.  With the wieght of the bus on it's wheels the 
link and kin pins joints will not accept the grease.  Also remember to grease 
until new fresh grease comes out of all of the joints of the front end every 
3,000 miles for longevity.   Eric&amp;Barb
