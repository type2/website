It can be used on either a standard or doghouse shroud.  The dished plate
is a _bus_ part, since it goes with the 38A bus generator no matter what
kind of shroud it is bolted to.

&gt; Does it use a different fan
&gt; (etc.) too?  I'd love to get this taken care of while the engine is
&gt; out.

It doesn't use a different fan, but it does use a different fan hub.  The
38A hub puts the fan closer to the tin.  The hubs are not interchangable
at all.

You might also consider converting to an alternator.  it uses the 30A bug
tin and hub and works very well.  Along with the bus tin, you need the
alternator stand and fuel pump to go with the alternator.
