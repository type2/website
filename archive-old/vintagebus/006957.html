  Who knows maybe he'll buy the bus bring it out to Havasu and leave it in
Michael Anthony's house (The guitar player, who has a house out here) and
use it for his Havasu crusier,when he's out, . There are a lot of splits
driving in our little town (population 40,000) in the middle of nowhere but
you will usually see 1 to 3 splits a day DRIVEN.


ronnie,   go for it eddie
