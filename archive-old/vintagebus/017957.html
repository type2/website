Hello Tom,

I'm hoping you can post this to the list for me.

I have a very nicely restored 73 VW Thing that I'd like to trade for either
a complete running Pre '67  21 window or a nice Westy.  My Thing is in
excellent condition and I just finished a 2 year pan off restoration.  The
entire body was chemically stripped and repainted.  The pan was sandblasted
and painted.  The engine and trans are rebuilt and brake system also
rebuilt.  I have a nice hard top for it and soft top is there but needs some
TLC.  The side curtains also need some help but they are there also.  The
car is very clean and original and I get all kinds of compliments when I
drive it.  I have very many pictures of the entire project I can email if
anyone is interested. I'm located in Southern California and the best way to
contact me is to email me at toeneez_at_yahoo_dot_com  Thank you very much my
fellow VW Fanatics! 

Tony in SoCal
