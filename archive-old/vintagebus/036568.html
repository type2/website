Hello All,
   I have an 57 singlecab (early) and its ready to be reassembled as soon as 
I straighten out the bed. (I am still looking for a small section of truck 
bed.) Otherwise everything is there and as close to original as I can get. I 
found the truck with all the usual cuts, but its all been rewelded so the 
body is correct. I'll be keeping the engine thats in it for right now, but 
may go for a &quot;proper&quot; motor later.  I hope to get it up to paint within a 
month so I can hopefully get it on the road in May.  I'm not sure where the 
mechanicals are at, but the truck was relatively rust free and looked pretty 
good underneath so maybe I'll get lucky and repairs will be minimal......NOT! 
             I picked up a 71 beetle to tow with our motorhome so I'll have 
another project, but thats for another list. This one was actually my wifes 
idea so I couldn't argue.  
                                                        
                                                                            
Steve

P.S.  Last does anyone know whats going on with PLF I have e-mailed them and 
no word. Or maybe someone has an extra canopy laying around.
