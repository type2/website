	&gt;Be gentle, it's my first time...

	&gt;In particular, I want to save the doglegs and walk-thru section,
two goals
	&gt;which at first appear to be mutually exclusive...


It is *easier* and *much* quicker to save one part at the
expense of another (but cutting the donor section and then
grinding it 'off' the section you wish to save).  But you can save 
both if you have time and patience.

Drill out the spot welds (all of em) and gently pop the 
pieces apart with a small cold chisel.  Here we have 'special'
drill bits for drilling spot welds called 'torpedo' bits - I'm sure
there would be similar in the US.  Air chiselling can also
work but will also do some damage - when you want to refit
the bits the time you saved by airchiselling is then needed
to repair the damage and fit....

First parts salvage? - the first cut is the deepest .....dah
dah da dah....... the first cut is the deepest.......
