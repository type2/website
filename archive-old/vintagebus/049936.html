Subject: 'That VW Guy' - A WARNING TO EVERYONE - LONG

First, some background:

On 1/2/00, I won an Ebay auction for a NOS 6v Bosch regulator, which I
purchased from Dan Kinsey (ThatVWGuy) for $32.02, plus $4 shipping.

I mailed a MO on 1/4, and I received the item on 1/12.  It was the wrong
part for a '66 Bus.  I did not ask for a refund, but I did inform Mr Kinsey
of the error.  No refund was offered.

Recieved 1/12/00:

&lt;&lt; Just got the part.  Unfortunately, it indicates on the package that it's
 not the correct part for my 1966 bus.  Oh well. &gt;&gt;

Sorry about that.





On 3/29/00 Mr. Kinsey offered his home made shifter extension for sale on
the list.

On 3/29, I sent the following message to Mr. Kinsey:

Hi Dan:

I would like one of your shifter extensions please.

Can I pay you through PayPal?  There is a $5 sign up bonus right now, and
if you mention me when you sign up, I get a $5 referral bonus!  Info at
www.paypal_dot_com.

Thanks,

Kabayo


On 3/30, I got the following response:

I guess I am a little old fashion but I don't want all my personal
information &quot;out there&quot; on the web.  I would really prefer a check or money
order.  Please check my Ebay profile &quot;ThatVWGuy&quot; and I think you will feel
confident about mailing me the funds.

You can send the funds and your address to:

Dan Kinsey
719 South Park Ave.
Independence, MO  64052

THANKS!


On 4/1, I sent the following message to Mr. Kinsey:

Hi Dan:

Payment is going out today.  Please ship by USPS.

Thanks,

&lt;&lt; I wouldn't get too excited over the use of aircraft aluminum for these.
 It's one of the most easily available sources of suitable tubing. &gt;&gt;

It is rod not tubing.  Tubing is much weaker than rod and I wanted to make my
extension as strong as possible.

Rant follows...

This is not necessarily directed at the last person to post but after reading
several responses to my original post I am very curious why so many people
**WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN MY REPRODUCTION OR TALKED TO ME ABOUT THEM** have so
much to say about them.  No, 6061 aluminum alone isn't all that exciting.
But if I had used some crap material and the extension broke on some listee
at an inopportune moment then there would be some excitement - the negative
kind.

It would have been cheaper to make them out of steel and have them
chromed...but the weight of the steel extension will wear on your transaxle
over time much the way a heavy set of keys wears on your ignition.  These are
not &quot;cheapo&quot; reproductions, I tried to make the best part possible.

As far as the price, I have been picking up extensions at swap meets for
several years trying to collect all the different styles available.  Yes, I
have even bought one or two for a dollar but for most of them I paid more.
When I did find one at a swap most had pitted chrome if steel or scratches
needing polished out if aluminum.  My reproductions need nothing except
installation.  Also, there isn't a swap meet every weekend and there aren't
extensions at every swap meet.  Finding one may be difficult and will take a
while depending on what part of the country you live in.  You can have mine
within a week of mailing in your check.

Lastly, if you read the original post regarding **extended period of
under-employment** you would realize &quot;Hey folks, I ain't got no job&quot;  Instead
of complaining about lazy people on unemployment (which most of us do) why
not step back and let one of the few trying to improve their situation do it
without all the comments...especially when you have never seen the part in
question.

rant mode off.

On 4/1/00, I made the following post to the list:

I really don't know why a few (very few) mildly negative posts has caused
this type of reaction.  Maybe you just had a bad day.  All I saw was some
folks discussing the pros and cons of your shifter extensions, and without
even having one to examine.  The one guy who said he had actually seen one
had nothing but praise, and he is the only one whose words meant anything
(since the others were only speculating).  Lighten up.

I have seen those extensions go for crazy prices on Ebay.  Beat up ones go
for $20+, NOS for $40+.

I'm sending you my MO today.

On 4/7/00, I posted the following to the list:

I have received my new shift extension from Dan, and it looks very nice.
I'll let y'all know how it fits when I get around to putting it on my bus.

Before anyone starts crying in their (German) beer, this thing has as big a
hole in the floor as it does in the roof.  Rocker rust is about knee high.
Not a candidate for restoration unless you last name is Gates, Rockefeller or
Fitzpatrick.  8-)

Roof section, sunroof mechanism, skylight glass are already spoken for by a
friend.  No middle seat.  Everything else is up for grabs.

I have yet to take a complete inventory but it appears almost everything is
there.

Jail bars
Rear seat jail bar

12V clock
12V gas gauge

**BLUE** front and rear mats - (will only be sold to someone with a '66-7 Sea

Pmail me if interested and I will try to put together a complete list with
prices.

I'll try and pull that off and take a look at the condition next time I am at
the bus - in storage a few miles away.

On 4/21, I sent the following to Mr Kinsey:

Hi Dan:

Check and see if it works from the inside before you pull it off.  The
symptom of a worn out lock is that it doesn't open the door when you pull
the inside handle as far as it will go.

Thanks,

Evan




On 4/30, I sent the following to Mr Kinsey:

Hi Dan:

Did you ever check out that lock mechanism?

I also need the little bracket that holds the gas flap key when not in use.
It mounts below the dash, on the driver's door front pillar.

Thanks,

FINALLY I remembered to look at these while I was there.  They both work well
though the driver side sticks a bit.  I'm guessing it is due to 10 years or
so in a pasture without use or lubrication.  I would think if you lubed it up
it would work fine.  Let me know if you are interested.

MY COMMENTS:  It has now been 14 days since I inquired about the purchase
of a door lock mechanism, and now I get a reply regarding DOOR HANDLES!
This from a guy who says he is out of work, and so presumably has time to
answer a simple question!



On 5/6, I sent the following to Mr Kinsey:

It's the lock mechanism I need, not the handle.  If it's good, pls give me
a price.

If you mean the lock mechanism in the doors I have no keys and therefore no
way of testing to see if it is good or not.  If you mean the latch mechanism
on the door itself they both work fine.  Please try and describe exactly what
you need.

-Dan




MY COMMENTS:  Now he doesn't know the difference between a lock mechanism
and a lock cylinder.  My confidence begins to wane.





On 5/6, I sent the following to Mr Kinsey:

Dan:

This is so frustrating.  I gave you a part number, for pete's sake!  'Lock
mechanism' means the device which is controlled by both the inner and outer
door handles.  It holds the door shut.  It could also be called the latch
mechanism.  Don't you keep your email regarding unresolved issues?  Look at
my previous mail.  Oh, what the hell, here is what I sent you before:

OK?




MY COMMENTS:  After 17 days, my patience is getting worn thin.  How long
should it take to get a yes or no answer, plus the asking price, for a part
which has been offered for sale by a guy who sells parts frequently?  Why
does this 'VW Guy' not know what a door lock mechanism is?  Am I using the
wrong terminology?  Rocky Mountain Motor Works calls this part the 'door
lock mechanism', Wolfsburg West calls this part the door lock, and I've
geven Mr Kinsey the part number, just to clear up any doubt.  How difficult
is it for someone in the VW parts business to look up a part number in a
catalog, in case he needs to clear up a nomenclature issue?

Dude, chill out.  There is a difference between &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;latch&quot;, there are
lot's of little parts and assemblies involved.  Lock mechanism could mean the
tumbler in the door handle, could be the door latch, could be the internal
workings of the door.  I ain't going to drive 15 minutes over to where the
bus is at, spend an hour and a half taking off parts, bring everything home
and spend another hour and a half disassembling, degreasing, and hunting for
part numbers when in 30 seconds you could tell me exactly what you are
looking for.

Bottom line is you probably won't want to give me more than $10 for this
part.  $10 doesn't justify three hours of my time hunting for part numbers.
If you can't tell me exactly what you want without getting bent out of shape
I think you need to look elsewhere for your parts.




MY COMMENTS:  So now it too much trouble to get the parts off of his wreck,
even though HE IS THE ONE WHO OFFERED THEM FOR SALE IN THE FIRST PLACE!




On 5/8, I sent the following to Mr Kinsey:

DAN:

I TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, COMPLETE WITH PART
NUMBER.  IS THIS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS?

*I* don't feel like you accurately described the part.  Again, I'm not going
to spend hours hunting for part number when you could just take a few seconds
and tell me what you want.  If you can't take those few seconds to save me a
few hours then you're not going to get the part or you are going to get one
that include 3 hours of labor.  I think we will have to agree to disagree on
this one.

Regarding how I treat my customers:  Yes, I treat every customer with your
attitude exactly this way.  I have sold things all over the world (US,
Canada, Japan, Italy, India, &amp; The Netherlands) and never had a problem.  I
have people mailing me CASH all the time because they trust me.  Aside from
one retaliatory negative I have a perfect Ebay profile.  I really don't think
I am the problem here.  Please disregard any of my future posts to the list
regarding items for sale.

-Dan




MY COMMENTS:  So, after using the same nomenclature as the two of the most
widely read parts catalogs out there, and further providing a part number
in my original request, I had not &quot;accurately described the part&quot;.  And,
after waiting over two weeks for a simple answer to a simple question, my
money is no longer good enough for Mr Kinsey?



On 5/8, I sent the following message to Mr Kinsey:

JERK




MY COMMENTS:  How did I earn this type of treatment?  By purchasing a
voltage regulator which was wrongly described in the Ebay listing as being
correct for all 6v VWs?  I suppose I should have checked to see if all 6v
VWs really did take the same regulator.  My fault.

Maybe my post to question Mr Kinsey's rant against anyone who would dare to
comment negatively about his shifter extension was out of line?  And my
later praise of the extension that I purchased didn't count for anything?
Must be my fault.


If you want to do business with a guy who acts like he's doing you a favor,
and like any time and effort he must exert to earn your custom is a bother,
rather than treating you as a respected customer, go ahead.  I can't
imagine doing business with My Kinsey again myself.  Fool me once, shame on
you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Fool me thrice, I don't think so...
