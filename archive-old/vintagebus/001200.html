Well folks, that did the trick.  I test ran my engine and aside from it
running a little rich (probably needs a 50 instead of a 55), it ran a lot
better and best of all, no fuel from the accelerator jets until I needed it!
In retrospect, I think it was the unregulated pressure from my stock fuel
pump forcing gas into the float chamber and the pressure was great enough to
override the accelerator circuit which resides in the bottom of the float
chamber.  This caused the accelerator circuit to be overzealous and much too
willing to relinquish it's fuel rights and whenever a little vaccuum was
introduced, it gave up its all.  I have a little leak from my fuel pressure
regulator that is simply a fitting that needs to be tightened and I need to
put some springs on the idle stops to help them snap shut at idle.  I'm
still idling a little high but that is okay for now.

Maybe I'll make it to Colorado after all. :-)

Later.
