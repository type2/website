Subject: Solex carb model codes

Hey Volks

I'm sure you're all aware that the stock carbs for split
buses were Solex PCIs and PICTs.

It never occurred to me to wonder what those letters stand
for, until I scored a Solex workshop manual this weekend. At
the front it lists a whole alphabet of model codes.

Those applying to splitties:
P = Pump (accelerator pump)
I = Down draft carburettor
C = Monobloc
T = Thermostarter (electric choke)

So now you know. File under &quot;trivia&quot; ;-)
