Go ahead.  Try it.  After you do one, you'll be happy to give the tire
guy $5 to do the work!

(Besides, the bead is steel.  You'll have quite a time cutting it with
a utility knife.)

&gt; dismount.  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut=
&gt; the tires off?  Could it be that
&gt; simple?  tia
