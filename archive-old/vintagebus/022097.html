NEATO's Old Bus Review #61 (which goes to print this weekend and should 
be in the mail September 28) has an article by Jim Bryant that addresses 
this very issue.

M-378 is an export code and was used on 1959-1963 buses, as far as we 
know, from evidence we have gained through the Old Bus Registry.

Become a member of NEATO for $20 and get the next issue of Old Bus Review 
(along with 5 more issues) for &quot;the rest of the story&quot; as Paul Harvey 
would say.
