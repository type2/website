&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah...I've been driving down the road when my bus started 
&gt; coughing and spitting...Jitterbugged down to where I could pull off,
and 
&gt; open the engine room door to see what's up -- a fine fog of fuel
everywhere from 
&gt; the fitting falling out of the carburetter...no fire, though, I 
&gt; must have been living right.

I've had the same thing happen with the brass fitting coming out of the
fuel pump. Can't remember if it was the intake or outlet, but was lucky
that it didn't start a fire. Of course, you know right away that
something bad happened, what with the car stopping and all the smell of
gasoline.

I then got in the habit of twisting a bunch of wire around the fuel
line, like around the hose clamp, and around fuel pump, sort of as a
cheap harness so that if the tube loosened it wouldn't pop all the way
out, hopefully limiting the leak to a slow ooze or trickle that I could
smell and investigate before lots of ml's of gas had erupted on the hot
engine.  Someone suggested this wire harness to me, saying that they'd
seen this happen before on the fuel pumps.
