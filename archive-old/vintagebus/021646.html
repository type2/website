So yes all early 36hp
&gt; engined `59s had crankstart equipment....and for the
&gt; next yet asked question...yes there was also a longer
&gt; crank start handle as with the newer style bumpers the
&gt; crank handle had to be longer to clear the wider new
&gt; style `59 bumper.
&gt; 

re parts list- vw kept making new parts and updating parts lists.  They came out with a new book probably every couple years, I have seen 56, 58, 61, 63, 66, 67  editions.  The mid 67 edition I thumb through a lot (dogeared copy) is before the reverse lights, and list what was available at VW when it was sent out to the dealers.   It has 50s stuff, but is a lot skimpier and less specific on the early stuff (due to supercessions and NLAs) than a 58 edition.   It does not list a cranknut, or crankstart rear tin,or crankstart apron(except it bd apron, not a postbd crankstart apron though) so evidently you could not buy these at vw then.  does not mean then didn't exist.   So what edition is the one you are looking at?  a 61 edition would be best for checking this stuff for a 59, but I don't have one  :(

&gt; I have seen and owned a couple of these buses.  It is
&gt; also verified in my `50-`67 VW factory parts manual.
