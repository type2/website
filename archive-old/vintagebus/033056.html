was writ:

I have seen places say they charge $500 for cores on certain things and i
call to offer to sell them the same part, and they say, oh we buy em for
$20, but we dont need any right now. The inflated core only applies to
rebuilds.

So, core charge on a rebuilt part doesnt neccecarily reflect market price
(but sometimes it does, wolfgang will pay cash for a lot of core type
stuff..)
-  ---  -- 
ya- but Wolfgang gives you $25 for what they charge $100 core charge for.  
Not that I have a problem with this- if they don't charge that much core 
charge they wont get cores back and it's a problem for them.   Especiallu you 
know when people are shipping stuff.    They pay $25 for a worn steering gear 
box?  great- When driving up or down the coast I've thrown a core or two on 
the roof rack, stopped in Redding  and got some gas money.  

but price-   I've had em given to me, least I paid was $35 axle to axle.      
That one lasted 30K miles or so. (then the noises were too loud))

If I knew  it was good, I probably would ask $300.  If it was something 
sitting out in the rain for a few year w/o a nose cone and someone offered me 
$100 I would take it.
