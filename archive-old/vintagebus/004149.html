I slapped some pics up from the last OCTO meet up on my site - check it out.
I left the pictures big for more detail.  Includes some photos of the
recently restored '54 Deluxe as well as many vehicles I had not seen before:

And on Saturday I came out of IHOP and lo and behold a guy was sitting there
is his '63 Single Cab.  I said &quot;nice truck&quot; and we talked for a bit.  Turns
out his family has owned it since 1965.  Nice rig, Pearl White (maybe
original paint), straight with a slight push on the passenger side where &quot;my
daughter bumped our garage&quot;.  Original bed slats still screwed in place,
nice grey/black mesh aftermarket upholstery in the cab.  Downside?  He was
running 165 tires so I told him to go with some 205 next time, save the
engine and all that.  And no, I didn't ask him to sell it.

Have fun a clickin',
