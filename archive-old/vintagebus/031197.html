Subject: Good Sunday

Tis a good Sunday for me anyways!  I figured out why the #1 and #2 
cylinders weren't firing...turns out it was a kinked fuel line to the 
right carb in front of the fan shroud that I couldn't see.  I moved it 
around a bit and re-fannagled it and vroom!  It fired up and idled even! 
  I did a compression test before figuring out it was the fuel line and 
found that I have 140 lbs in each cylinder give or take 5 lbs.  That was 
without adding any oil :)
So I hop in the bus and take a spin down the block to my buddy Billy's 
house, or beginnings of a bus farm as some may see it.  He has a few of 
em over there.  I proceeded to show off my engine and how it starts with 
the flick of the key.  Since I had the tranny out there was some air in 
the brake lines.  So with his help of pumping the pedal, I bled the 
brakes and now there is fresh fluid in there and the brakes are great! 
I put on new rear brakes last year too...

One thing I noted about driving this bus is how when you accelerate it 
throws everything in the bus towards the rear of the bus!  WOW does it 
have some go!  Heres the skinny:

1600 dual port
new heads
new rings/honed cyls
type 3 lower cylinder tin
doghouse
fuel infected beetle fan shroud (velocity ring)
6V 200mm flywheel (thanks Ken!)
nearly new clutch
dual Weber 34 ICH carbs with hex bar linkage
header with a single quiet pack muffler

Now I just have to adjust the thermostat (or install a new one), put a 
new oil pressure sensor in, and sync the carbs up and I'm set.  So far 
with the short drive I'm *very* pleased with it.  Once I get new license 
plates for it I'll take it out on the highway and see how she does.  It 
feels good to drive a split again!

I'm off to drool over my bus,
Isaiah
