uh, i think there are four bearings because there are four places that need
a bearing due to the offset of drive and driven axle.  but wait, vw just
threw stuff together without testing or researching anything, i'm sorry i
forgot. no wait, they ran out of 6306 bearings and small rear drums which
is why they changed to larger axles/brakes/lower-outer bearing, yeah that's
why they changed.  they do help support the load, gearing really doesn't
play a big part in that, but i think you meant since there were two axles
to deal with.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt; The bus RGBs with thier four bearing per side instead of the type 1 &amp; 3s
&gt; &gt; one per side, were definitely to help deal with the heavier bus body and
&gt; &gt; the much larger/heavier cargo capacity.
&gt; I would strongly disagree with the word definitely. I would say 4 bearings
&gt; per side were a necessity due to lowering the gearing.  Once you have 2
&gt; gears there, they have to be supported both ends to mesh properly unless
&gt; the shafts are fixed and stiff, which they are not in this case.
