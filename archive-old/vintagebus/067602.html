Subject: Bus on TV

Anyone watch Oliver's Twist on Food channel? I saw a very pretty blue bus,
not sure the year. It was in England, and they were picking up herbs off the
side of the road. One time they showed them stuffing in what looked like
weeds into the back, piled high. I yelled at my wife to look, because
normally the guy jets around on a scooter, but he had a friend driving him
around.
