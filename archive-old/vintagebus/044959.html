&lt;&lt; What do you mean by &quot;blueprint&quot;? &gt;&gt;
Hi Andrew,
Check out Tom Wilson's &quot;How to hotrod your VW engine.&quot;.  While a rather 
vintage book it still shows important little stuff to check and 
file/sand/polish to get just right.  Like making sure the oil pump passages 
are prefectly aligned to the ones in the case.  Checking the hieght of the 
pistons in the cylinders to make sure the crank bore is not offline or if you 
just need to mix and match rods to get the piston hieght as equal as 
possible.  Set your compression ratio low enough to prevent detonation which 
will put a hole through a piston easily.  
  We even cut/drill out all of the casting flash in the heads that prevent 
the movement of cooling air.  Drill holes through the bottoms of cross fins 
on the head that prevent air movement through.  See 1963-67 VW bus shop 
manual for simular though bigger diameter drilling of 40HP head fins approved 
by VW.  Polish the exhaust passages to smooth out the rough casting in there 
to reduce the surface area for exhaust gases to transmit it's heat into the 
head material.  Check all oil passages for complete drilling and clean with 
gun bore brushes.  Find out where the timing marks on the stock pulley really 
are!  Etc. etc......   Eric&amp;Barb
