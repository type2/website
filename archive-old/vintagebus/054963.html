&gt; By the way, when messing with gasoline and the fuel

&gt; your Bus, you do have safety glasses, a fire
&gt; extinguisher or two RIGHT NEXT
&gt; to you, and better yet someone there to put you and
&gt; the Bus out in case the
&gt; unimaginable were to happen???  And with all that
&gt; volatile fuel vapor
&gt; about, work in a very well ventilated area, like
&gt; outside.  No ignition
&gt; sources anywhere nearby too!

Remember, an incandescent drop light (i.e. a light
bulb) IS a source of ignition!  When fuel hits a light
bulb, it can implode, and set off the fuel.  Always be
very careful of drop lights around gas.
