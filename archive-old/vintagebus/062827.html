Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?

   I do have Genuine NEW German pullys and they are worse then the OEM
Mexican that I sell, when I can find them and even had had some great
Brazilian. I also have a made in U S A pulley that is stamped from spring
steel. These have been very good IF INSTALLED properly. I have had a few
come back wollowed out (I covered them) by incorrect installation.

I love this non-vintage stuff :)

I just got off the phone with Greg at Parts Obsolete... He made a great
point that I am curious to hear from the people running 912/356 pulleys.
Greg claims that the offset is different on the T1 VW pulley versus the
912/356 pulley.  Essentially you cannot run a T1 VW pulley on a 912 w/o
alignment problems.

So how does the belt line up on the crank pulley versus the generator pulley
when running the 912 parts?  Any thrown belt or longevity issues? Special
shimming maybe?

Greg seemed really nice and helpful so they might be getting my used Porsche
parts business from now on :)  (I had some additional inquires about some
other parts besides the generator parts)

Also Greg pointed out that it is not good to use old and tired generator
pulleys that are all whored out from years of use.  And at the same time
splurge for the correct 9 Porsche shims so it all matches perfectly.

Rant:
I wish more good quality VW generator pulleys existed...  Currently I always
end up replacing the crappy Brazilian or EMPI Taiwan every couple years
because they get sloppy so fast (out of the box they suck).  I guess if I
looked hard enough German ones probably do exist, but I bet the Porsche
stuff might cost about the same and deliver a better product (better cooling
in this case over machining).  VWoA just keeps kick themselves in the nuts
by not offering quality replacement parts.  VWoA needs the program Ronnie
keeps talking about that Porsche developed for old NLA parts.
