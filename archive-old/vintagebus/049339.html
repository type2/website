Alright you guys!!!!  Thom??!!!!!!  I can take it, I can take it.  Give me the abuse, it's o.k.

Regarding JP's question about the *box* in the photo, I'm almost sure that this bus belongs to Steve (can't remember his last name) in the U.K.  It is a righthand  drive Westy.  The small extra box is a cooker he had made for his bus since he didn't have the original Enders stove.  Kind of a cool little accessorie, although since it isn't original I'm not going to pull any hair out over it.  I'm losing enough of that without even touching it. 

Getting old is hell.

Robert
