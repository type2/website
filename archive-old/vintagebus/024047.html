Subject: hot motor--fast bus--redoction gears!!

during my quest to find a way to get my 1776 motor to run a little
cooler in the 111+ heat of phoenix--with a 3.88 rancho tranny--the heat
is mainly do to high rpms as i have been told.  lots of expensive ways
to lower the rpms--remove reduction boxes--ergo lower the bus!! change
axels--tranny and on and on--a fellow vw guy who is also into any car
motors, then said , if the high rpms are due to the lower gears in the
reduction boxes, why not have taller reduction gears??  like 1-1
gears!!!  this sounds good!!and a simple solution???  what if some vw
shop made 1-1 reduction gears for us bus people who want to cruise at
70mph???is this a possibility?? or an oversimplification of a problem
that will not work?? will 1-1 gears fit right in?? if they will, then
how tall can you go??
any thoughts out there??or am i just dreaming--
1963 VW HEARSE
1964 Doublecab w/1776 and hoping
