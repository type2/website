It was reported here in February that Alan Schofield in the UK
(http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/) had pickup beds for around US$600. 
Also, Mark Lytle in Washington reported in April that he had
successfully reproduced a bed for about $500 and might be able to supply
others as well.  Pictures of his effort are available at
http://www.centralia.wednet_dot_edu/lytle/59sc.html and his email address
can be found at http://cen.quik_dot_com/mlytle/index.html

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;    Yesterday I spend a chilly Nov Northern Ill day in my UNHEATED garage
&gt; going over my 57 singlecab with a friend who is going to do a little welding
&gt; for me, and we were discussing what to do with the bed. Either spending time
&gt; to straighten it out, or to just replace it with new metal. I have seen
&gt; various suppliers of sections (but no full pieces), I'm sure someone on the
&gt; list has had this same dilemma and I hope to benefit from their experience.
&gt; Any help will be appreciated. Also would anyone happen to have a correct set
&gt; of early tail lights, engine lid, and crank hole apron laying around and need
&gt; some Xmas $$$$.
