Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome raffle bus

A big thanks to those of you that kicked in. We don't have everything yet,
but we are closing in on it. Very nice, and this year it didn't all come
from a short list of vendors that gave heavily, but from bus folks. Those of
you that I know that kicked in I am sure will stop by the carpet for your
just reward. Those of you that I don't, stop by too. If you don't like the
mandatory, stay off the rug. A big thanks to Uncle Jerry for putting the
message out, and to Ronnie for making it easy for folks to give what we
needed. Lots easier to call him than to go shopping and then have to pack
and ship. I am planning to drag the partially completed bus to Familienfest
so folks can see it, hope to see you there.

Kyle
57 singlecab

61 Kombi
67 Westfailure
57 Oval


Ronnie writ:

&gt;    Through the generosity of a few list members about every thing on the
&gt; want list (Jerome 62 Sub hatch Westy) has been covered .  A couple of
items
&gt; that were not able to be covered were a rear cargo mat and a wiper motor
&gt; assembly.  Kyle (westfailure and coordinator extraordinaire) should be
&gt; pleased and for those that come to Jerome and spend their 50 cents to win
&gt; this bus will be blown away.
