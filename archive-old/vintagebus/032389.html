Peach State Transporters'  5th Annual Dead of Winter Campout at
Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia mountains is this
weekend.

The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of Trenton and I-59, 18 miles
NW of Lafayette.

Last year we had about twenty buses over the weekend.

We will be camping in the larger of the two different campgrounds,
on the far rim of the canyon.  They also have cabins for those of
you who don't like cold weather camping. Campsites have water
and electric hookups, so bringing space heaters is a good idea.

There are great hiking trails down to the waterfalls as well as around
the canyon rim. So bring warm clothes, extra blankets, musical
instruments, firewood, and come join us for a great winter campout.

A caravan of buses will be leaving from the main parking lot of
Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta today no later
that 4pm (everybody PLEASE show up between 3:30-3:45pm
WITH a full tank of gas) if anyone else in the area wants to ride
up with us.

I will cook a turkey Saturday night for dinner, others can bring
side dishes for the dinner.  I will also cook everyone breakfast
Sunday morning.

Pack some warm clothes and I hope to see you there.
