unfortunatly kids tapes with old macdonald and stuff like that works
real good. When my wife pops it in and they all start singing it
absolutely drives me up a wall!!! I wonder how I got from being a
guitar god with a long flowing mane, boozing it up all night long and
having girls at my beckoning call to a 9-5 dad with his butt crack
climbing out of the top of his shorts and driving a mini-van full of
kids singing like they had an overdose of happy pills. KNICK KNACK
PADDY WACK GIVE A DOG A BONE!!!!!  Jane!!! Get me off this crazy
thing!!!!!!!

We do a lot of traveling with our kids (non-VW). The absolutely most
valuable item we've ever purchased was a TV/VCR that plugs into the
cigarette lighter. We've actually gone through 3 of them over the
years. But we take a 400 mile trip at least once a month with them.

The second best item we bought was a set of headphones for each kid
and splitter for the TV headphone jack. Dad doesn't have to use
earplugs anymore.

I'm sure people will chime in about experiencing the road and looking
out the window and such. But my kids have had to travel like this
since they were born. We're all experienced travelers now and I can
say politaclly correct or not....this is THE way to go if you want
some peace and quiet. Just regulate how much you use it.

p.s. We use it the whole time! That's me though. I'm &quot;TV friendly&quot;.
