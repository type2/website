Subject: Re: [VB] oil temp gauge

I've used oil temp senders at three locations. &quot;T&quot;'d off the oil pressure
switch, drain plug location, and the pressure relief sender. By far, the
most convenient has been the pressure relief area.

The drain plug senders get in the way when changing the oil, or using a
floor jack to remove the motor, and the sender located off a &quot;T&quot; where the
pressure sender is, reads low temps, usually reading the actual engine case
temperature.

Pressure relief valve location has always given me an accurate temp reading
(checked with thermometer down the dipstick tube), and when the wire is
routed, it is not in any danger of being snagged by anything you are driving
through.
