Subject: Re:tranny options

I have people giving info both ways on that. Almost everything I have
heard
has completely conflicted. Some people have told me that you get better
mileage with taller gears some say worse. Some say it will run hotter,
others say cooler. I know it will be less noise. I can also see the
arguments both ways. Taller gears the motor turns less, less gas, less
heat.
Shorter gears the fan turns faster, less load on the motor due to the
wind
resistence on the front of the bus. But which way does it actualy
happen. I
have experimented with a lot of different gear sets in water cooled
vehicles, and I have seen considerable fuel mileage increases by giving
them
a higher gear ratio, hovever, these were in vehicles that were less
underpowered than my 1600 sp bus. thanks

&gt; John,
&gt;     Running 4000 rpm all day is fine if the engine is mint.  Yes, use
a
&gt; counterweighted crank and get all parts balanced, crank, rods,
flywheel,
&gt; pressure plate, fan pulley and pistons.   You may have power and
&gt; overheating problems running a bus at less than 4000rpm going 65 mph!
&gt; My '66 1500 westy with 4:375 rear gets better mpg than my '67 1600 bus

&gt; with a 4:12 rear.     Gary Gibson
