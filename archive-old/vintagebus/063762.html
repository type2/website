That's the only one I've found.

&gt;&gt;The engine I have with a dual relief case has a 73 mm uncompressed
spring by the oil pump, 30 mm up front. Whether these are right/wrong, I
don't know as I have not been able to find the dual relief spring specs
that state the uncompressed spring length. It also has 2 solid plungers.
This is a dealer/factory rebuilt engine, probably from the late
1970s.&lt;&lt;

73mm = ~2.87&quot; which is much closer to what I took out.  Haven't pulled
the pressure control plug, spring, plunger yet to measure that spring.

&gt;&gt;At one point, this engine had the light begin to come on at idle, the
front oil plunger was stuck in the downward position, which results in
lower oil pressure all around. &lt;&lt;

This is exactly what Muir warns against with the dual pressure setup. 
I'm not considering Muir the only expert on this at all.  It was just
some of my reading last night.  This valve is supposed to open at ~28
psi to return excess pressure to the sump.  If it's always open, how can
you ever get up to pressure?  Clearly, this is where I have to look
next.  If it's stuck open, how could I ever get up to pressure?

Now, who as specs for proper length of both relief valves on a new
Mexican(?) case?  Should both plungers really be solid or should the
pressure relief plunger be the slotted (1500S as Muir calls it)?
