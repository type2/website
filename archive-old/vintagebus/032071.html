Hi Chuck &amp; Jan,
We use a hose clamp and also a large outer dia. washer, to both keep the tube 
from moving front/back and to help close off the slot in the front of the fan 
shroud to keep the cooling air where it belongs.  For the accelerator cable 
where it rubs on the tranny VW used up to 1960 a wire bracket to push it away 
from the tranny case.  Later VW used a tube like the clutch boden tube, but 
longer and thinner.  This tube was a bug part cut down for the bus.  Does 
anyone have a supply of these?  You can use a fuel line hose clamped onto the 
end of the body accelerator tube.  Just make sure to cut off this hose about 
three inches from the front of the forward engine tin.  Eric&amp;Barb
