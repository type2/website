There is still one show on the East Coast where a split bus driver can frolic in a late model free environment, and that is Bulli Brigade, which just so happens to be around the corner, Novemebr 10th, in Tampa.  Email me for more info or a show flier on your doorstep.

&gt; It's a real shame the split and bay guys can't get together on the west
&gt; coast.  Here in the midwest and on the east coast, if we did not admit the
&gt; bays and even the vanagons and EC's, our meets and campouts would be very
&gt; small.
