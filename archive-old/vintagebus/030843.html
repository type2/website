&gt;   Don't think Easter's my favorite
&gt; holiday....but then most who know me know I'm not a holiday kind of
guy.  I
&gt; work seven days a week:  not many hours each day, but seven days.

Even if a tragedy did happen,  at least today is all about resurrection!

Thankfully you and Lou dodged the bullet or the nails which ever analogy
you
prefer.

&gt; PS I guess the moral is: Carry a fire extinguisher,

No.   CARRY TWO!   Ever try to put out a raging car fire.  Believe me,
you'll
need more than one puny car size.
