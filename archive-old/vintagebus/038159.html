i am parting out a 61' euro split. i want to take out the locking steering
column. in order for it to work on another bus do i need the whole steering
column box etc. or just the steering lock below the steering column??
-  --  - -
the steering/ig lock portion attached to the column combines the ig aswitch
and a mechanism that allows the steering to be locked by a tingue that pops
out of the lock portion towards the column.   The corresponding column tube
has a ovalish hole in it with a piece welded onto the actual column that runs
through the tube.    Without the lockable column, the tongue will merely press
against the outsid eouf the tube, but the steering with still turn as there is
nothing to lock against.  

 In short, yes you need the appropriate steering coloumn for the set up to
work.  

 The plate that holds the column to the dash has a hole with a grommet for the
ig wires in it- keep that, and the grommet steering/ig lock to column, and the
plastic covers for the wires on the left, and the white plastic plug to fill
the usual ig switch hole on the right.
