Subject: Options for retaining hubcap clips
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm at the point of installing repro hubcap clips on my wheels. I have to
admit it was pretty tough getting the original rivits off the broken clip
remains. I'm not really into banging the rivits that came with my new repro
clips to mushroom them to fit. 

What I had planned on doing was pop-riviting them into place. But I got to
thinking, why not just nut, lockwasher, and bolt them? Seems like it'd be
easier to replace broken ones this way. I've got all the hardware already
to do it. I've attatched one that way and can't find a reason not to do it.
About all I could think of is build-up of dirt and debris making it a
little rough to remove the nut. But there are lots of &quot;exposed&quot; nuts and
bolts under the bus. I'd be painting the clip, nut, and bolt when I do the
wheel, as they'd be attatched. Removing that nut couldn't be much worse
then getting those darn originals off. Anyone else done this?
