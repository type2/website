Subject: [VB] Barndoor reflector on eBay
Message-Id: &lt;991108105548ID.25370_at_webd2.iname_dot_net&gt;

Just thought I would mention that:

Vw Bus Barndoor SplitScreen Rear Reflector..! 
Item #192548955 

is not a correct Barndoor reflector.  It is 55-57.

Here's the info I sent to the seller, who did not post it on the auction:
1. It does not have a black back like Barndoor -&gt; early non-BD reflectors.
2. It has scripting on the lense, Barndoors do not, the scripting is along the edge.
3. The diamond pattern is &quot;small&quot;, indicating 55-57.

Just wanted to let people who may be bidding know.
