Subject: RE: [VB] Redux bearing loads (was bug center section)

sounds fair to me, but i am not a rocket scientist, just a lowly bus
slaver-over.  my brother-in-law IS a rocket scientist (for real-at
livermore labs), maybe i could ask him.  in my experiences, though, i
usually see the lower inner and upper inners go the most, then the outer
upper, then the lower outer.  maybe the inners (late style box) go more
(for my experience), because they are still the 6306 ball, and with the
greater speeds of the 1500+ motors and faster rotations, they get beat
more.  the late style lower outer is far superior to the 6306, and i
usually haven't noticed them fail, unless there is a piece of bearing cage
from another bearing stuck between the rollers. i've actually taken apart
reduction boxes that had balls of the bearing shot out throught the side of
the housing, the balls had made a progressively smaller half-moon shaped
indent in the gears of the lower axle and then finally got fused/welded to
the last tooth, and had shattered the housing into 4 big pieces.  would
have liked to experience that one!  must've been LOUD!  anyway, there are
still thousands of these things driving around with that design, so i guess
it isn't that bad.  i also almost always replace ALL the reduction box
bearings when i put a bus on the road (my current camper being the
exception).  then i have no question in my mind as far as their
reliability, and i know i can drive for many, many 1000's of miles before
having to do it again.  and i spend the extra money for german bearings, or
find them at shows for cheap, no china bearings here!

&gt; Unless the force is centered between the bearings, the bearings will
&gt; actually see more force due to leverage and torsion as compared to a long
&gt; axle where leverage is not such a factor. If you look at a bus lower stub
&gt; axle it is much longer away from the outer lower bearing than it is
&gt; between the bearings.  Did you ever wonder why the lower outer bearing
&gt; always fails first? If VW had designed it so they shared the load  
&gt; perfectly wouldnt you see an even distribution of failures between the two
&gt; lower bearings? 
&gt; 
&gt; If you can tell me *exactly* why with even forces the lower outer bearing
&gt; almost always fails before the lower inner bearing, then I will believe
&gt; that you truly have a psychic connection into the minds of the VW
&gt; engineers and do know exactly what they intended.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, I'll stick with logic and figure the forces must be uneven for
&gt; such a lopsided failure mode to occcur.
