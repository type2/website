Hi all,
Thought I would give the list a shot at this for sale.
I have a full length metal roof rack for a bus. It's the later model but fits
pre-67 perfect. Has one broken leg in the center that can be welded back on.
Rack is in Concord, Ca. (northern ca.) and cannot be shipped. 
Price is $300 

Thanks
Dave Barnes
