Thats a pressure blaster, and as I remember Thom had an opinion about the HF brand.  I have one of them.  If you put good valves and a proper nozzle on them they work fine.  I found mine at a swap for 15 bucks.

Guess I should clarify, they do sell quite a bit of sand blasting equipment.
     I think it would be considered a pot type blaster, not the syphon feed 
type, and not a cabinet. the kit consist of a red metal tank with two wheels 
to move it around, a hose, and a nozel.
