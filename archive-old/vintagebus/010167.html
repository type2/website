I'm kind of winging it from memory here, but there may be an alternative.

Marine supply outlets sell several styles and models of wiper systems, all
pretty basic and simple but having stainless steel arms, etc.  Boat
windshields tend to be flat or nearly flat, at least in the area to be
wiped.

I've installed a couple that looked just like the old aftermarket wiper
motors for Jeeps and '30s and '40s vintage American autos and trucks.  The
shafts are fairly long to accommodate various frame thicknesses, and some of
the arms are adjustable in length.  The blades are usually just a simple
straight blade.

Might be worth checking out.  Wouldn't be &quot;correct&quot; for a show rig, but
might offer a real world solution.....

&gt; I remember Bob Hoover Telling us all about the early Jeep wipers fitting
&gt;perfectly. Do a bit of measuring first as I dont remember details like if
&gt;the arm needed to be Jeep as well or not.


Yeah - matter of fact, I have a jeep blade that a guy gave me and it looks
just like the old bus style blade.  I need the wiper ARMS though therefore
currently I have nothing to hook the wiper blades to!  Besides, this ANCO
wiper arm that I have does not use the SWF blades - it uses a shorter but
more common standard cartridge blade.  Anyone ever see one of these?  Must
be aftermarket.
