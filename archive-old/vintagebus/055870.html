Subject: Re: [VB] Big tires on a pickup

&gt; &lt;&lt; What are the drawbacks to having 15 inch tires on the rear wheels of a
big
&gt;  stub (1965) pickup? I bought it that way and I don't know if I should
change
&gt;  them back to 14 inch or leave them alone. The fronts have 14 inch tires.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;

&gt; FWIW my 61 has the big stub/nut RGBs with 15&quot;s on the back.    Actually it
&gt; has 14&quot;s on the front right now (till I get the 15&quot; rims powder coated and
&gt; new tires), which makes the speedo read higher than it really goes, and
the
&gt; bus has that tilted nose dive look.

Didn't 15&quot; wheels come standard on some years? If so, could you use a speedo
from that year bus and have 15 inchers all around and still have the speedo
show the right MPH's?
