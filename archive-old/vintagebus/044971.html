The interesting part is that, except for three places over the windscreen,
where origin of the rust was obviously on the exterior surface above the level
of the rain gutter (and then grew into it), the other rusted areas were
discovered UNDER the thick coat of seam-sealer with with Volkswagen 'sealed'
the gutter... and originated INSIDE  the bus.

Sounds a bit fey but the bottom line is this:  If you want to keep your rain
gutter from rusting out, do something to seal the INNER side of the seam.  The
seam-sealer was still in fair shape -- a hell of a chore to remove -- but
offered no defense against rust coming from INSIDE the vehicle.

Dancing on the roof of your bus in the drizzly PNW may be fun but the drizzle
found its way through the holes and following the curve of the roof, to the
flange at the edge of the roof panel... which on the outside is the rain
gutter.

In this gorgeous PNW, there is a lot of water in the air.  Condensation
happens, it drips down the inside of the roof and gathers in the convieniently
located channel around the edge of the roof seam- inside the bus, and sits,
oozing everywhere it can, even into the seams (eek).    Crust happens.   Thus
I believe it be a good thing to have heat to help dry out your bus as well as
for the comfort of it.  Sealing the water out, and keeping it dry inside is
good.

BTW, Grendel was only in this area a comparatively short time.   Less than a
year (6mo?) before you bought it it was driven from Colorado, it's previous
home.   I saw it for sale in Oly and talked to the then owner, though it
passed though a couple hands before you aquired it.
