Had that happen to me once, I was moving a 1955 1 owner original Porsche
Speedster over into storage from my shop one evening, when i got to my
storage the speedster was gone! Backtracked my route and found the speedster
sitting in the middle of the street about 2 miles back, major heart failure
there, loaded it back on the trailer, useing only my rachet tiedowns and got
it to storage. Lesson learned, always connect a saftey chain so if your tie
downs break at least the vehical won't come off the trailer.

ronnie  moving vehicals with saftey chains now

Jeeeeze man!!!! You could have whiped out a whole family!!!

I lost a canoe once on the highway. One of the scariest moments of my
life. It wasn,t due to lack of care tieing it on though. A piece of
crappy plastic broke, freeing the ropes. Still, I really tie that sucker
down now.
