Subject: [VB] Re: Heater box connecting tubes

Jim Cahill said:
&gt;That being said, PVC has come a long way 
&gt;since the 70's. They now make PVC that will vent high
&gt;efficiency furnaces from  houses (no need for a
&gt;chimney anymore).  I wonder how this would work, 
&gt;because it has to handle the
&gt;heat from these furnaces

The changes have been in the furnace design, not the
PVC.  Even boiling water can deform PVC--I have
witnessed kitchen drain problems where a kettle of
boiling pasta water was dumped in the sink, and
actually softened the PVC closest to the sink.
The newer high efficiency furnaces and gas water
heaters have exhaust gas temps that are barely warm.
