&gt; I can say that I have NEVER had deep cuts
&gt;in the side of my tires. Maybe a little wear mark from the edge of the
insert.
&gt;If what wade says about a cut from the edge being a big danger I can only
&gt;imagine what danger would come from someone actually cutting a large w i d
e
&gt;groove in the sidewall to give the appearance of a whitewall.
&gt;Just wanted to give some input from some who has experience with inserts
and
&gt;uses them................

 Im sorry to hear you have &quot;NEVER&quot; had deep grooves in the side of your
tires due to inserts. Its such a joyful feeling to happen to look down one
day and see a 1/8th inch cut in the side of your tire all the way around. I
know 2 ppl that have had this problem. one guy runnin 165s and the other,
135's. Both their sets of tires were junk after about 5 months.
The guy who makes you whitewalls, merely cuts a very minute groove in the
side. nothing compared to what the inserts have done to the set of tires I
have in my backyard. they look brand new with perfect tread....just that
HUGE gash in the side that seems to scare anyone away from wanting them. If
anyone has seen uncle jerrys herbie bug then you know what im sayin.
although his have just begun to cut last time I saw it.....hope it doesn't
get any worse
