Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Slightly Custom&quot;

Whatever one may think of customized buses, it does look like a very
nicely done piece of work.

But the part I can't believe is putting over 2500 hours of labor into a
project, then &quot;selling it so I can complete other projects&quot;.  What, 2500
hours of effort didn't make it personally valuable enough to keep?  This
was just a passing fancy until some bigger challenge came along?  Those
&quot;other projects&quot; must really be dillys!!

&gt; this seller calls his bus &quot;slightly custom&quot;! HaHaHaHaHa! thought you all
&gt; would find this amusing. and i like how the airbags make it &quot;better than
&gt; stock!&quot; :-)
