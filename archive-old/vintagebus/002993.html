The ones they donated to the Jerome raffles were exactly the same as what is
in the SO-42 buses I have seen. If there is a difference, I must not be AR

last night, I would bet there are several people who would back me up on
that. (So to speak)

&gt; I believe they have a mis-print in the year listing. Those are bay window
&gt; style handles, not 67 and back. Instead of 58-79 it should say 68-79......
