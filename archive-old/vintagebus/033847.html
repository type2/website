Subject: Re: [VB] Euro Tails on U.S. Bus?

Yes, I did this in my 61 15 window.  A PO had already put oval tailllights in 
it, so I swapped them out for the euro style- the amber turn signal is 
safer/more visable.   

I bought a 18&quot; cable of 4 wires wrapped in that black insulation, get 16 
guage, and ran it from engine compartment up to fuse box area.  I did this 
for the guage wires, and there was extra wires, right.    

What I did was leave the turn signal wiring alone, and plugged that into the 
turn signal part of the bulb holders.   Then I separated the brake circuit 
from the turn signal wires up by the fuse box.   UNplugged where the brake 
circuit plugs into the turn sig wires leading to the back, and plugged than 
into the new wire run to the back.  I like those VW connector things you plug 
the two wires in to to connect them,  good thing to take from junk bugs.   SO 
the brake system is now separated form teh turn signal system, and runs 
through  you new wire to the back, well, take that wire to the right brake 
light- and add a wire to take it to the left brake light.  No big deal.

A american turn sig switch works with the euro wiring taillights

&gt;  Came across some repro euro tail lights (complete assemblies, lenses, and 
&gt;  seals) for real cheap. I've been having tail light gremlims while running 
&gt;  headlights for sometime now.  After comparing euro and US spec wiring 
&gt;  diagrams, I noticed the euro bus' have a diff turn signal switch.  Any 
ideas 
&gt; 
&gt;  how to make these euro tails work on a 66 US spec bus?  I don't mind if 
both
