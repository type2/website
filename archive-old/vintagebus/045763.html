Pomona was the worst I have ever been to it was a buyers market, everybody I

talked to (seller) also said the same, but o-well, not very many bus parts

there anyway, but a lot of buses for sale in the parking lot, especially

deluxes.

- = = = = = = = 
that's it, folks, buses are out of style.  No more celebritys with be 
cruising the shows or buying buses inflating prices.  Even the Japanese 
market will fall apart, leave buses as cheap uunfashionable vehicles again.   
 The speculators will be burned.
