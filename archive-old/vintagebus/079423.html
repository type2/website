Subject: Re: [VB] manual carb

Ya... i took the 30/31 Pict off the adaptor yesterday and put the new carb 
on.  I prefer SP myself, but I got this motor as a functioning DP, and don't fix 
what ain't broken.

Clara,
So do you have to also use an adapter to match up the SP carb with the DP
manifold?
Dave

&gt; I got the carb from Bus Depot, and a choke cable from WW.   I'm going to
go
&gt; try to install the cable this afternoon.  Wish me luck.   The carb looks
like a
&gt; 30 pict  (round bowl) with manual choke, and does indeed fit the 1600 SP
&gt; manifold.   it's going on a DP 1600 for me.
