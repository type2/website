Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] cleaning hardware

I don't clean parts beforing storing them.  Better for them to be oily 
greasy, keeps rust away.   Even in the garage things rust.  Sometimes I oil 
things for storage.

If something's really goopy I'd clean it in the solvent bucket before using 
it, but generaly just a wire brush on the threads, or a tap/die, it is.  Just 
to get any gook out of the threads. 

Wouldn't rolling the bolts around mush the threads?

&lt;&lt; &gt; I was thinking that a really good way to clean all the hardware (nuts, 
bolts, 
 &gt; misc little bits) would be to run them through my rock tumbler with some 
 &gt; medium grit for a day or so.  scrub thoroughly to remove the grit and 
voila!  
 &gt; shiny clean pieces parts.
