Hi Jon,
Did you make sure the clutch throwout cross shaft had it's arms even to the 
sides of the tranny input shaft?  Plus you should make sure the clutch throw 
out bearing is held also evenly to the input shaft, and the forks of the 
throw out cross shaft holds the bearing with a little slop side to side.

&lt;&lt;B) I noticed that my Bowden tube doesn't bow anymore.&gt;&gt;
Hmm, not good.  You should have have checked to make sure the rear end of the 
clutch cable tune was solidly welded to the body (BTDT!), and if so to 
install large washers on the rear end of the boden tube to get the correct 
curve to it.

&lt;&lt; C) The cable I got from my FLAPS is the wrong one.&gt;&gt;
Get the right cable ASAP (Plus a spare is a good idea to carry!), and fix the 
boden tube when you replace the cable.

&lt;&lt;Everything seemed to work fine, but as the cable is stretching my clutch is 
getting looser and I'm having trouble getting into 1st gear.&gt;&gt;
That sounds to us like a bad clutch tube since you replaced the cable already 
which could have caused this to happen if the cable was stretching.  Or it 
could be you did not have the boden tube seated correctly to begin with, and 
now it has seated itself.  Either way having the clutch adjusted badly enough 
to hamper shifting destroyes the syncros in the tranny all too soon!  Unless 
you learn to shift without using the clutch by RPM per MPH properly.

&lt;&lt; There is also noise coming from back there when the clutch is released, ie 
pedal to the floor.&gt;&gt;
Kind of a whirring sound?  That is what it sounds like when the clutch 
throwout bearing is offset from center to the clutch pressure plate.  Which 
soon will render the clutch cross shaft, throw out bearing, and pressure 
plate to junk soon!
