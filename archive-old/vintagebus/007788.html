Going through and loading stuff for the Phoenix B-O-R and found i have some
early front door windows and frames. think they are 54. They have the
different shape windwing handle and the flat lock plate for the w/w handle.
Also the large letter Serkuit (Spelling ?) on some of the glass. Wrong
slider latches though. You BD guys check them this Sat. Need gas money for
KP. Also still have the 52? dash pod for sale.
2 fuse boxes and large plastic starter button on the left side.
See you all at B-O-R

John Howard
