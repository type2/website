&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 I adjusted my valves sundays and put in a new set of points 2 days ago as 
 well as set my timing.  Yesterday bus ran like a champ with the absence of 
 brakes like usual.  About 8th of a mile from my house I ran out of gas on 
 the top of a hill and rolled backwards a 100 yards or so parked and got gas. 
   I kept my accessory lights on for the coast backwards.  I have been real 
 careful not to use the accessory due to past experiences with frying points. 
   Do you think that short of a time is exceptible to fry a brand new set of 
 point.  Due I have a super hot coil?  Any ideas?
  &gt;&gt;

did you change your condensor too?  they do need the replacement as well, you 
know.   and get you brakes sorted before you kill someone.

What are accessory lights?   you mean you left the key in the one position so 
the dash lights were on? That can fry points if it is left on to much .  
leaving the headlights/taillights on won't though, you do not need the key on 
for that. I hope this helps.
