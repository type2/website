Subject: Underdash gas heater question

------=_NextPart_000_007E_01C18FE1.25AB9560
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a Splitty under dash gas heater that I have never installed in my =
bus.  I live in FL so it is not like I *really* need it except for the =
few days a year it gets cold during the winter and a couple days during =
the summer when I am on vacation in the mountains.  For the other 360 =
days I'm a little worried about the amount of legroom it will take up.  =
Does anybody have one of these installed who can tell me about how the =
passengers comfort is effected?

Thanks,
Dan
