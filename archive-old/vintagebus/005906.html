Hey,

How come all the repop fried egg lenses have the chrome
plate on the outside? As long as the plastic is getting
plated, why not do it on the inside like the originals?

Anyone? Anyone?

How about all you retailers complaining to the manufacturers
or at least to the distributors. Maybe the word will get
back to the manufacturers.

&gt; hel all,
&gt; my bus has some pretty beat turn covers and ive been
thinking about what to
&gt; do... leave em, find good one$, or get some repops. i got
the new VW Trends
&gt; yesterday and on page 13 see some repops from WCM which
dont look too bad in
&gt; the 1/4&quot; black and white picture. anyone have 'em. im
worried about the
&gt; shiny part just rubbing off in a week or so.
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
