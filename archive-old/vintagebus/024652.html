Subject: Electrical Problems

It goes like this.  Right turn signal will work.  I turn on
left turn signal and no lights, but I can hear the relay
clicking.  Allthough not as loud.  Try the right one again
and it is the same as the left, no light but it is clicking,
softer than before.  Wait about five minutes and the right
will work again.  The front turn signals are disconnected. 
I am only worried aboput the rear ones.  The bus is a 1967
Kombi.  Has anyone experianced this before?

Also how hard is it to install a wiring harness.  Is it
pretty much straihgt foreward, colored wire for clored
wire?  Or is it more intesive?  I would use a complete
harness.

Thanks for any all responses, especially if they work!
