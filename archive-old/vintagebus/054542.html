&gt; &gt;it is a beetle after all
&gt; and a kind of late one at that
&gt; 
&gt; Let that be a lesson to you. This would have never happened in the truck.
&gt; You wouldn't have been thinking negative thoughts, and you wouldn't have got
&gt; smacked. 

kyle, your thoughts and humor are very much
appreciated.  on a serious note, one of the big
reasons i don't like driving my single cab as my
commuter car is that it's been butt slammed already
under previous ownership.  i used to have a u-shaped
middle brake light deck lid and my truck has some
thick filler to show for that little encounter.

when i drive my single cab in stop and go traffic i
feel as if i look through the rear view more than the
split screen.  i know that i also try to send
telepathic messages to all the drivers behind
me... &quot;watch the middle light, don't look at the
lights at the sides, the middle light, watch the
middle light.&quot;

while my 67 beetle is being repaired, i'll drive my
&lt;gasp&gt; 1956 beetle unless the smell of this afternoon's spilled sweet banana peppers drives
me out... then i'll turn to my truck.  yeah, i know, i can hear you know... if i'd taken my truck to the
store instead of the beetle i could just hose it out
and call it good.  oi!  ;-)
