&gt;Or maybe we should just give it a rest and not purchase anything from him.
&gt;Bombarding him with emails doesn't sound like a solution.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't like the way he does business, don't do business with him.
&gt;There are a lot of good comments about him, including one: &quot;...and well
&gt;packaged...&quot; :-)

&gt;&gt; Here is the address of the greedy lister: &lt;nickm63_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why not send him a note and tell him what you think of his
&gt;&gt; 'Handling charge'?

I guess the guy is a real packaging professional, and wants to be paid as
one...
