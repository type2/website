&lt;&lt; it's brand new, not rebuilt. it has unleaded
 heads, and it was made at the mexico plant. i will
 have it set up with dual weber 34's, bosch 009,
 lightened flywheel, and empi gt-style muffler. &gt;&gt;

I would keep the stock flywheel.  Lightened fly wheels are great for quick 
RPM's needed for drag racing but aren't very good for keeping the rotational 
momentum you'll need for a highway driver.  Unless your building a drag bus I 
would keep the flywheel stock.  Any other opinions?
