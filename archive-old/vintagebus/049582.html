Subject: valve keepers and wear

My buddy and I were dissecting some heads today; we noticed that several
valves on recently-rebuilt heads had SEVERE wear on the grooves/lands that
hold the keepers. The lands were reduced to about the thickness of  dimes
:P  We  see this on exhaust and intakes....

Is anyone else seeing this? Softer valve metal, lousy keepers that score
the metal, valve float?????????
