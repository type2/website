Subject: Re: [VB] Wolfsburg West Truck Corners

..........
&gt; buy a WW body metal part. WW/brazilian parts dont fit worth crap.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; WW jackpoints= junk
&gt; WW rockers= junk
&gt; WW short rocker = junk
&gt; WW top hats = junk
&gt; WW cargo floor = junk
&gt; Same story every time. Spend 5 times the amount of time making it fit right
&gt; and modifying it and
&gt; when you get done, you wonder why you didnt just make it from scratch.
&gt; -Wade..............

Hmmm, just getting ready to order WW rockers, jack points, outriggers, etc.
for my 65 Deluxe Westy(?). What about Alan Scofield's products-2-3 times the
cost (_at_ Bus Depot), but worth it???? I know Kelly makes his up to order, so
looking for something off the shelf. I did compare an inner rocker side by
between WW &amp; Scofield &amp; it appeared they were slightly different depth,
corner radius, etc.

Inquiring minds need to know,
