&lt;&lt;   For the transporter assume the excess pressure in the engine compartment
 (because it is well sealed) is pushed in the fan and via vanes in the fan
 shroud to tin surrounding the heads.  The higher the pressure the more
 cubic feet of air is pushed through.   If the scoops are on, the pressure
 into the engine compartment is regulated by speed, with the effect of a
 ramjet.  If you stop, the scoops effect would for pressurization would be
 negligible.  Perhaps it will compromise the amount of air due to the
 smaller intake and less cubic feet of cooling are available?

ya, that's what I'm thinking.  At a stop the engine compartment is 
vacuumised, and the scoops have little or no effect.

Air can be compressed easily, so when the campartment is pressurised, the air 
blown by the fan is denser than the usual 1.2 kg/sq m or whatver it usually 
is.   I'm thinking a sensor to measure pressure or speedo of air coming out 
of the heat boxes might be useful.

I'd expect pressure in teh engine compartment be regulated by speed, with or 
without vents
