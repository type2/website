Tom and the rest of the list,

Don't spend $80-$100 on a front emblem.  Roundtoolbox_dot_com has very good
repops for $39.95.  Well at least they did when I purchaced one (and a
tool box) back before the Classic.  The emblem seems very good quality,
the chrome is very good...not great.  I've not subjected one to the
elements, but at 40 bucks a piece, you can buy two!  BTW they make both
early and late styles of emblems.

The address is &lt;http://www.roundboxtools_dot_com&gt;  
and you can order off the site or call them directly.  In my experience,
they were prompt and very nice to deal with.  I did have a delay in a
shipment, and to make up they gave me an extra set of tools as well as a
discount on a future pruchase.  Good luck, and tell them I sent you.

PS:  I have no affiliation with this company.  I was just a customer
that experienced good service.

Steve Harris
