&gt; I'd guess the real bind is the corner, where the edge has to &quot;flip&quot; when you 
&gt; open it and that's where it resists most.  Maybe notch/slice the corner

&gt; not a continuous flap?  Just an idea for an experiment....

We were wondering about taking a spare slider window assembly we have and 
tape sand paper to the slider glass so as to sand/polish the seal down to a 
usable amount.
