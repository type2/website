&gt;any suggestions on putting [the front shift linkage] back together 
&gt;appreciated.

I did this very recently.  http://www.type2_dot_com/splittyreflect/msg40229.html

&gt;but now putting the linkage between the pedal and the angle bracket which
&gt;goes to the accelerator cable? which direction should this linkage go...it
&gt;is basically S-shaped.

I would call it more of a U-shape if it's the same part I'm thinking of -
number 74 at http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/367.png .
The ends of the rod should point towards the driver's side and the rod
itself should be towards the passenger side.

&gt;Also the boot on the front of the cylinder didn't look to be in great
&gt;shape-can you replace just the boot, or do you need to replace the whole
&gt;thing?

I'm pretty sure you can just replace the boot.  It doesn't hold brake
fluid - you don't have to bleed it after you replace it.  I think it
is mostly there to keep junk off the piston rod so it doesn't beat up
the seal where the piston rod goes into the master cylinder.  When I
bought a replacement master cylinder it came with the boot loose in
the box.  Try West Coast Metric.

Good luck!
