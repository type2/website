Subject: Vent wing latchs

    I just recieved an order from WW and am pleased to announce that they
have made a beautiful reproduction wing vent latch. These are avaiable in
chrome and black!. Even thouh they are not really correct for a bus a little
ginding on the tip and you have a beautiful well made wing vent latch that
should last as long as you own your bus.
