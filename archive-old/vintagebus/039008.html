&gt;Put in new main seal and FW O ring, and rejetted the 30/31 pict 
&lt;snip&gt; 
&gt;The oil pressure has dropped somewhat (I have a guage), and even 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;also, it is a friggin slug.   There are hills I don't expect to pull in
4th,

I'm sure I'm completely off track here (you all have read about my
comedy of errors before), but I'd hazard to guess 2 separate, unrelated
problems are causing this.  

Oil pressure:  Any chance the oil slinger was installed backwards (or
not at all)?

Loss of power:  Your carb doesn't like the new jetting or got some crap
in it somewhere?  Or maybe you're just not getting full throttle.
