&lt;&lt; The battery fell out in transit. I've put another in, natch, but I'm
getting a generator light. There is a cluster of wires near the battery that
are just hanging out. Is there supposed to be a wire from the + battery
terminal directly to the Voltage Regulator (mine's mounted on the firewall
behind the oil bath air cleaner) or is this connection made via the solenoid?
Eric and Barb, are you there? &gt;&gt;
Hi Liversnapz,
We are more familair with pre-1964 buses, but in general they are wired the
same as later ones in the engine area.  The battery ground strap bolts to the
right side of the engine lid opening.  The positive cable from the battery
goes to the solinoid on the starter.  At the same place as the battery
positive cable on the solinoid there is a thick red with black spiral stripe
wire going to the regulator.  Next to this, but not touching the red wire on
the regulator is the blue thin wire for the generator idiot light.  On the
other side of the regulator are two wires to the generator.  Check out Thom's
vintagebus_dot_com for wiring diagrams and get yourself a copy of the Bentley
reprint of the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67.
