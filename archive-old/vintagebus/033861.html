I've got the tent for my 67 Riviera, and it does indeed have a rope sewn
into one of the edges which fits into a channel on the roof of the bus.
There are 3 pieces of canvas:  The roof, and the two sides which wrap around
and also become the front.  I'm missing one of my sides, the right one, so
if anyone out there in bussy-land has one, let me know!!  BTW...the poles
look like electrical conduit, and I'm pretty sure they are original.

Hi Amanda,
That is a bit wierd since you have a Sundial.  It sounds like you have a 
Riviera Camper tent.  Does the tent have a rope sewn in the edge that slides

into that aluminuim channel over the cargo doors?  If so you might want to 
buy the proper tent from PLF and then sell/ trade off what you have now.
