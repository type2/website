Thats why you should leave it stock, no headaches.
Custom is a bitch.

&gt; I purchased a set of the 5 spoke polished wheels
&gt; made by American Eagle for 
&gt; my 59 bus and thought it would be a matter of unwrap
&gt; and bolt...NOT.  the 
&gt; first thing that doesnt work is the hardware kit as
&gt; it is all 14mm and I 
&gt; didn't even think about that originally.  Next is
&gt; that the wheels will work 
&gt; on the back with some special lug bolts (where can I
&gt; get them) and the fronts 
&gt; won't fit at all.  (are people using spacers??)  I
&gt; think I may have to change 
&gt; the brake drum, but then I imagine there will be a
&gt; lot more to change to.  
&gt; The rear drum looks like a spiral and the front is a
&gt; well to big to clear the 
&gt; center of the wheel that in turn would allow it to
&gt; sit flush.  I need some 
&gt; help again guys and gals, cause these wheels were a
&gt; little investment so I 
&gt; have to keep going.
