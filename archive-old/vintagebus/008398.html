Using DOT 5 will do more than &quot;gum up switches&quot;, it will also destroy seals,
though the process will probably take longer with bus brake systems.

This discussion comes up quite often in MTB circles, as half the brake
manufacturers use one type of brake fluid, and half the other.

DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5.1 are compatible

DOT 5 is totally different, it will almost certainly cause leaking seals
(the seals are compatible with either type of brake fluid, contact with the
other type will cause them to degenerate), which will all have to be
replaced AFTER the system is properly flushed and cleaned, and it will
probably create a gluey mess within your braking system if mixed with DOT 3,
4 , or 5.1 fluid.

The primary advantage of DOT 5.1 over DOT 4, is the higher heat rating. This
is an issue with limited volume systems used in high performance Motorbikes,
and the small hydraulic systems used on MTBs, but a bus's brake system
should have sufficient volume, that the fluid expansion (due to heat) should
not be sufficient to create any noticeable problems.

IF anyone wants to use DOT 5.1, the easiest place to get the fluid is bike
(IE motorbike) shops. it's used for Ducatis, later Sports Hondas etc.

Hope this is of use.

&gt; &gt;   The silicon based DOT 5 will gum up your brake light
&gt; &gt; switch on the MC. I put a solid state type switch on
&gt; &gt; there that is attached to the frame rail and actuated by
&gt; &gt; movement in the pedal arm. Lights go on before the brake
&gt; &gt; travels through its free play, it's great for telling
&gt; &gt; tailgaters to back off without actually braking.
&gt;
&gt; DOT5 fluid may or may not be compatible with all the materials in your
&gt; brake system.  No guarantees!  Also, DOT5 fluid will not absorb water,
&gt; which sounds good, but consider that any water that ends up in the system
&gt; will go to the lowest points, the wheel cylinders, where it will do its
&gt; corrosive evil if you don't bleed then now and then.
&gt;
&gt; I play it safe with DOT3 and DOT4
