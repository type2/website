Subject: Re: [VB] Jack point repair

I agree- go get a $20 rolling floor jack.  leave it in the bus in case of 
flats or emergency engine pulls.    I jack it under the U under the tranny in 
the back (put a piece of 2x4 on top of the jack) and under the beam in the 
front, just behind the swing lever (put the piece of 2x4 betwen jackand 
beam).   If these places are rusted out, the bus shouldn't be driven.   Some 
folks live in Az or So Cal where they expect jack points to be functional and 
intact, but in the PNW that is rarely the case.   If you try to use it on 
your average VW around here you end up mushing the bus as the jack point is 
smushed upwards.  Even if the jack points are intact, the stock jack is quite 
wobbley, and not terribly safe.

&lt;&lt;  The best thing to do, is repair as best of your ability, then go buy a
 cheap floor jack to use to jack up the bus when necessary. In ten years of
 bus and another 15 of air cooled I have never used the jack points on any
 air cooled VW and/or Porsche
 
 ronnie  better safe then sorry

 Subject: [VB] Jack point repair
 
 
 The PO of my 67 kombi did a terrible job fixing what I assume was caused by
 an incorrect jack usage in the rear right jack point.

 I need advices on how to repair this. 
 Should I rotate the jack point clockwise using force? Should I replace that
 section? How about the metal sheet?
 Any input would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks
