Hi All,
I am new to this list and if I have offended anyone, my sincere apologies.  
Our bus has been in storage for 6 years now.  I just think it's time to get 
it back on the road.  We've saved money to fix it up, neither one of us know 
how to do the project, so we just want to have a good job by someone who does 
know how to do it.
Laura

 &gt; Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
 &gt; spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
 &gt; would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
 &gt; Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
 &gt; that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn &gt;&gt;
