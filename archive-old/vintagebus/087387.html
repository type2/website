&gt;What is the function of the rubber spring plate bushings?
&gt;Mine are the originals. That is about the only part of my bus that I 
&gt;have never had apart.
&gt;Do they wear out?
&gt;Get hard over time and not function properly?


when they wear out, the rear alignment on your bus will go south, and 
you will spend $$$ and YEARS trying to figure out why your bus still 
wanders - despite the new tires, new shocks, new front end parts, 
steering box, etcetcetc.
