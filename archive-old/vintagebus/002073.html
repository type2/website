Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz sports a couple of these rims.  When he went on a
Lincoln VW Club cruise a year or so ago, there was a single cab recent
arrival at a salvage yard that had a couple of these rims on it.  I do
believe Dan saying it was an original but very rusty looking 58 SC.  Since
he has the 58 Binz, he thought it only natural to get the 2 rims to
compliment his array of accessories.  As I recall, they have Kron Prinz
stamped into them as well.  I think that is German for Crown Prince - a
known rim maker for VW.
