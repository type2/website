Sounds like either your clutch cable is about to break, or you've got a broken
pressure plate.  Either that or you had some kinks that have been stretched
out of the cable, and it needs adjusting again.

One thing to be careful of when adjusting the clutch is to not let the cable
twist; it causes the cable to break.

&gt; Before I got my bus back on the road, I had to undue the wing nut that

&gt; worse. Then today something happened and the play in the pedal drastically 
&gt; changed making it barely drivable. I'm at work now. I adjusted the pedal to 
&gt; get the play out. Only thing is now the clutch cable/pedal seems real 
&gt; squeeky and noisy. And going into first SEEMS kinda loud and growly. My 
&gt; idle is way too high right now, but it was that way before and I don't 
&gt; remember that much noise.
