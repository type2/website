Alright..got the bottom two 17mm nuts out..that was easy. The next two, the
ones on top. Reach around behind the fan housing and loosen them, thats the
name of the game, right? HA! Funny joke, I bet you're all sniggering (thanks
Eric&amp;Barb) as you read this.
&quot;HeeheheehahahHAHAH! He's talking about those two bolts on top that are a
royal pain in the *insert expletive*!&quot;

As I think I just posted recently, an easy way to see what's happening when
you remove the upper 2 nuts AND the engine is to angle up the rear of the
bus (drive it onto ramps of about 4&quot;- if undrivable, jack up each wheel)
while you lower the engine and trans combination back to level, using a
concrete block and appropriate 2x6 pieces as shims to hold the trans.

if you have a non dog house set up w/o the thermostat you can get a ratchet 
in there to turn the nuts in front of the fan housing.   Yes it is a pain if 
they are stuck.  somehow it happens, and the leverage area is harder around 
there than when  laying under the bus and can use my weight to loosen the 
nuts.   Anyway, I find bracing against something solid, and cussing, helps 
undo them.    You can find the bolt end on the one by the clutch arm - tricky 
to get to, and try from under there, but the one that goes through the 
starter is above the starter and should have a half moon head to it so it 
doesn't turn , though my first bus a 59 had  hexes both sdes and i'd start it 
by hand and put vise grips on the nut, and put a long extension and a short 
extension and a socket on a ratchet and tighten it.

hope this helps

BTW in a splitty, a 67, the trans is a swingaxle (unless something weird 
happened to the bus) and does not drop down like an IRS in a 70.
