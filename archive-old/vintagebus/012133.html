Don't get me started on tickets.

I'll give you a story.

I got stopped in the Acura the other day (August) for doing 40 in a 35
zone.
No biggie.  Cop comes up, gets my license, goes back to his car to
radio it in.

Takes a little longer than I thought it should, all of a sudden, 
another car comes speeding up, officer opens his door, pulls the
gun, and hides behind the door.  The first cop steps out of his car, 
breaks out the cuffs, and slaps them on me, saying something like
you can run for years but we finally catch up with your type.

I'm going &quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot;  Second cop comes
out from behind the door, walks up with the swagger and a smirk,
saying things like, &quot;Yeah, got another.&quot;  They wouldn't even let me
lock up my car.  The first cop throws me in the back of the patrol car
and off we go.  (I know now why they call 'em bulls, I think it is because
of their hard head and thick neck).

Well, we get downtown, they parade me past all the dregs of Alabama
lowlife waiting at the jail door (Used too, I didn't see the lowlife, now 
I are one). Somebody in the crowd says something about how my shoes
are &quot;gonna look good on PJ, once he see 'em&quot;

 I call my wife, and she goes hysterical, &quot;Arrested, for what?&quot;
&quot;I don't know, Babe, just call Brooksie&quot;(aw, attorneys, everybody hates
'em, everybody needs 'em).  Can't find him, call your cousin, the Clerk
of Court, and see what he can do.

Finally, someone who can grunt in these guy's language.  Ted says I was
driving while suspended and they picked me up on a no bond warrant.
&quot;What the hell does that mean? I'm not suspended!!&quot;
&quot;Don't worry cuz, I'm going to get you out as soon as possible. Maybe
you won't have to spend more than a couple of days in here.&quot;

He makes a call to the judge, judge says &quot;Let him go, but you better come
see
me in the morning!&quot;  &quot;Yes sir, judge sir, you honorship, first thing!&quot;

Next Morning, 7:00 AM sharp.  Earliest I've been up in about 3 years, I'm 
(with my shoes, shined) in front of the same guy who played in that movie
with Joe Peche, you know the guy who played Herman Munster?

Herman says, &quot;Plead Guilty or Not?&quot;
Says I, &quot;Not!&quot;
Says he, &quot;Pruvit!&quot;
&quot;Yessar&quot;, says I.

After three weeks of research and long distance phone calls, turns out I 
got a ticket back in 1983 in Virginia.  I agreed to pay the fine, but
Virginia
tickets had to go to trial, so they send out the fine after the trial, as
well as
report it to the home state.  Alabama, with so much wisdom and vision, 
suspends my driving privileges, in 1983.  I paid the ticket within three
days after the fine was assessed, so I wasn't late.  Virginia agrees that
Alabama
acted with haste.  Virginia even provided a receipt for the payment, after
15
years, almost to the day.

Since that ticket, I have been licensed in Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, 
Texas, New York, and California, as well as Alabama again.

HERE'S THE DEAL, IF YOU DON'T READ ANYTHING ELSE
		READ THIS!!!

A database system was placed in service about 3 years ago. It's
called the National Driver's Registry database.  Most, if not all 
states in the country now have loaded record data WITHOUT
verifying data validity or integrity.  If you got a ticket in the 
past, you NEED to check the database.  Most of the problems
I have found concern tickets more than 10 years old.  

I found the same thing with a ticket I got in '86 (I was on the 
road about 100k a year back then) in Louisiana.  In the process of 
clearing this off my record, the manager who was finally able to 
help me told me that they had about 95% of the entries were
wrong.  In my case, the ticket I got was in '86, I took care of it
promptly. I moved to NY, and then back to Austin, TX, in '89.
Texas told me I had a ticket that needed to be cleared up before they
would issue a license.  At that time, I still had the receipt where I
had paid it, but had to take it back to Louisiana to clear it up.  That
was in '89, it had been cleared the second time.

As I was researching this Alabama problem, I found a Louisiana entry
as well.  It was the same ticket.  It took going all the way up to the
governor's office to get someone to help me.  Every single person in
the DMV said I had to PAY $100 to get this off, even though I had
taken care of it over 13 years ago.

It's a scam for the states to collect money.  The logic behind this is
you took care of it years ago, you surely didn't keep the records for 
10 years, but the state kept the charge.  And you got to pay to get it
off.  So the state collects twice for one charge.

By the way, My wife has had 1 ticket in her life, in Lago Vista, Tx.
That was in '91.  It was also in the system, even though she had paid
the ticket 7 years ago.

Moral:  Keep the thumb on the authority, or the authority may put
the thumb on you!
