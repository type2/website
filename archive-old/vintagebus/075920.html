 Besides, i've yet to put a tach on the '61 or calculate the wheel 
 rotation:crank ratios but it seems this bus is happiest around 60 kph. 
 Do i have &quot;mountain&quot; gears? It certainly climbs like a goat and 
 requires quick shifting to second...

odds are that you have a 4.38 r&amp;p and 36mm nut (1.39) RGears.  I had that in 
the 59 truck I had, and going 55mph it was winding out.  52 was the sweet 
spot.  Odd thing was driving the uglytruck on the freeway at 52 no one flipped me 
off.   Random people waved and smiled.  It think it's the odd looking truck 
thing or something.   The 53 has roughly the same gearing, and the red line for 
4th gear is at about 80kph.  I think the book says that's about 3600rpms.    
It can go faster, but the mice complain.  It seems happier at 40 to 45mph than 
on the freeway.  Not ideally suited to freeway cruising.   But the low gears 
are great for hills.

actual mountain gearing is very rare.   That is giving the bus RGears one 
step lower than usual for that year.  It very likely would be on the M code 
plate.   It generally was ordered on buses that hauled folks up to ski areas, I saw 
it on a bus that was ordered by an airport for hauling luggage to airplanes 
(double door double slider, samba w/limited slip diff, mountain gears, orange 
paint stock, other m codes too.  Now it's slammed, dewd, yar.)  There is a way 
to calculate the gearing by jacking up one rear wheel,  turning the engine and 
counting the times the wheel goes around ( this avoids taking the boxes apart 
to check). 
   I would like a limited slip differential though.  think that's M220
