I wouldn't go that far.  Just expect to have to do some

&gt; Its been discussed before, but post-62 busses a have a recessed area where

&gt; Thom and I both had problems installing the C.E. safaris because they were 
&gt; engineered for busses with this recessed area.
&gt; Word of advice for anyone wanting safaris.....
&gt; BUY ORIGINALS OR STICK WITH FIXED WINDSHIELDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
