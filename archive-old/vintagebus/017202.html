There are a *LOT* of inconsistencies in the catalogs.  Trust the VW 
parts book.

And you're right about the bullet lights, although I prefer to call them 
&quot;nipple&quot; lights, but I'm a lover, not a fighter...

&gt; I checked my parts book and it shows 'bullet' front turn signals in amber as

&gt; way to '67.
&gt; 
&gt; The WCM catalog does the same. I thought that 'bullets' went the way of the
&gt; dodo in '63. Am I correct in this assumption?
