New Parts For Old

Friends, a few years older than me, have their recently
divorced daughter living with them.  Mixed emotions.
They're glad to have more time with their grandkids, a
pair of rambunctious boys but saddened over the failure
of their daughter's second marriage.  And the financial
burden it carries.

Parked in the grove behind their house is a 1972 Westy,
residue from her first marriage. It has been there ten
years.  According to family legend, there was something
wrong with the engine.  If they can get it running, it
will be the perfect vehicle for the young woman and her
two boys.  This conclusion was probably based more on
emotion than logic but on economics overall -- it might
cost less to put the bus back on the road than to buy
something else of equal utility.

My friend is a retired machinist.  He understands
automobile engines but has never worked on them to any
extent.  He asked my help in surveying the bus to see if
it was repairable.  We pulled it out of the weeds and
made a list of what had to be done.  I guessed it would
cost at least two thousand dollars.  Being a machinist,
capable of doing much of the work himself, my friend
privately thought it would cost less.  We put down some
plywood and used my floor jack to drop the powertrain.

The engine had been 'improved' by the woman's first
husband.  It lasted less than a year after he started
messing with it.  Some of the tin-ware was missing as
were most of the seals.  Fortunately, the missing carbs
and oil-bath air cleaner were in an oil soaked cardboard
box marked 'Bus Parts' up in the rafters of the garage.

It took a week to coax the rusted exhaust studs into
releasing the nuts they'd held prisoner for a decade but
once we got the heads off the problem was clearly
evident:  The valve seat on #4 exhaust had come adrift.
Unfortunately, they kept driving the vehicle unit it
shattered the piston and bent the rod.

While my friend began work on the engine I took the tin-
ware back to the shop.  Two critical pieces were missing
but I was able to find them at a local junk yard for a
few bucks.  I mixed up a batch of TSP, put the big boiler
up on a couple of fire bricks and used charcoal to get
things hot.  Three days (and ten pounds of charcoal)
later, the TSP had removed all of the paint and grease,
revealing a lot of rust.

Type IV tin-ware is fairly large.  I've got a large
plastic tub I use when acid-etching such parts but the
tub was being used for something else, forcing me to make
up a suitable tub.  Cardboard box.  Five-mil plastic
sheeting.  Reenforced with duct tape.

I used commercial-strength toilet bowl cleaner to eat
away the rust.  Don't let the toilet business fool you.
The basic chemical is phosphoric acid which comes under
a bewildering number of names.  It took about five
gallons to fill the tub and even then, some of the parts
had to be etched one end at a time.

Once the tin-ware was down to clean, bare metal I
straightened the parts that were bent, welded up the
cracks and generally did whatever was needed to repair
them.  A few nut plates were missing.  I cut replacements
&gt;from junked tin-ware and brazed them into place.

As each piece of tin-ware was repaired, I gave it a coat
of primer and hung it up to cure.  The weather was cool
and damp so the curing went rather slowly.  Eventually,
all of the tin-ware was done, dangling silently all over
the shop from fish-hooks of bailing wire.

The rear drums and front rotors had been sent out to be
turned.  The crankshaft was ground &amp; polished to the
first under-size.  My friend overhauled the rods himself
and balanced them, too, along with the new pistons.  He
wasn't impressed by the quality of the new cylinders and
we spent quite a bit of time cleaning up the castings and
painting them.  I'd included the push-rod tubes and valve
covers with the other tin-ware.  Replacement parts were
trickling in but the 'new' oil cooler was used and the
first fuel pump was the wrong type.  I'd warned him about
the kiddie-market mentality of most after-market VW
suppliers but he was still surprised to see it at first
hand.  He began inspecting each part as they arrived,
ending up rejecting about half of them, trying different
suppliers until he got what he needed.

My friend overhauled the master and slave cylinders.
When the other brake parts came back I went over and
helped him bleed the system and check it out.  As a
precaution, we dismounted the clutch and brake pedals.
They got a thorough cleaning and coat of paint before
being reassembled with a new pivot bolt.

When the weather warmed up I was able to put the gloss
coat on the tin-ware.  It looked really nice.  After it
was fully cured I wrapped the tin-ware in newspaper,
packed them into a box and took them over to my friend's
house.  I had no idea how long the overhaul would take or
even if he'd ever finish.

He'd torn down the tranny but all it needed was new
synchros and proper adjustment of the shifter forks.
While waiting for the crank -- it was being balanced with
the flywheel and pressure plate -- my friend had
overhauled the carbs.  He thought the linkage and
auxiliary manifold rather gimcrack but stuck to spec in
repairing them.  He also dismantled the alternator and
replaced the bearings, a task I'd never tackled.  (Type
IV alternators are different from those on upright
engines.)

When the crank came back I went over to his house again.
We checked the deck height and valve train geometry,
putting the thing together and taking it apart until we
had the best match.  I showed him the silk thread trick
we use on aircraft engines as we bolted things together
for the last time.

The lower cylinder shrouds must go on before the push-rod
tubes.  He opened up the cardboard box full of tin-ware
and began digging through the wrapped parts.

&quot;You didn't have to do that,&quot; he said.  I didn't know
what he meant and said so.  &quot;Buy all this new stuff.  We
could of cleaned up the old parts.&quot;  It took a couple of
minutes to convince him those WERE the old parts, etched,
primered and given three coats of glossy-black rattle-can
paint.

I drove home that night feeling pretty smug :-)

-------------------------------------------

The engine runs fine.  I talked him into using a CDI
module and platinum-tipped plugs.  The brakes work great,
once we figured out the check-valve was bad.  But he's
still not too happy with that carb linkage nor the crazy
low-speed circuit.  After it was on the road about a week
we decided the spring plates needed to be adjusted.
Since then, it's been a daily driver.

The kids love the Westy.  They were allowed to 'camp' in
it a few times while it was being overhauled. They're
already planning all sorts of exotic trips, some to
places as much as a hundred miles away.  And I understand
the daughter has found a new boyfriend :-)

Bottom line?  About $3000.  And five months work --
probably around 400 manhours, only a few hours of which
were mine.
