&gt; Is it possible to get em replaced at a glass shop or do I have to look for

Hi Jdd,
Do you have the sliders with the latches that go through the glass or not.  
That makes a big differance if you are trying to match replacement glass 
perfectly to the original.  As for what years will work in a 1960 it is a 
real narrow era from late 1955-1967.
