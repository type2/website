kid of the 2000's. Yup, thats right a trust fund &amp; credit card.  .. dude, it's recycled plastic and like it has a picture of the sacred Redwood on it and every $500 I spend on it they donate $5 to the Sierra Club. So in like 20 years when Spiritwind (my son) is old enogh to travel he can look at it from a few miles away because it and Mother Earth will be protected from the hurtful gaze of human eyes and the evil trampling of our soulless corporate sponsered feet that are cloaked in the explotation of foreign labor and natural resources....Dude my cell phone's ringing...I'm late for work..now where did I leave my Starbucks nametag?
