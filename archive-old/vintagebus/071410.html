Subject: Copper in oil

I did a sump plate reading as I changed the oil in my '60 DC...

I didn't really like what I saw.

First...a confession.

The &quot;official&quot; oil change before this, the second one after the Shasta Trip, I
did a &quot;quickie&quot; oil change.  It had been about 1500 miles since the last one.
Then, the next day, I found that I had overfilled enough to make me want to
drain some, and doing so while it was hot, I burned the living cells off my
fingers, and ended up draining the crankcase fully (about 200 miles later).

The oil change tonight came in at 1100 miles and two months.  I haven't been
driving too often, but it's getting really hot here, and there's LOTS of dust
from my driveway.

Anyway...to the good stuff.  I am pretty sure that I am seeing tiny copper
flakes in the fine gray sludge in the sump (no more of that than usual, I
think).  There seems to be copper in the oil in my drain pan, as well, but
only at the bottom...

Comments?  I want to know if my engine is about to go south, or should I drive
a few hundred to a thousand miles and check again.
