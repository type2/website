&lt;&lt; I don't think that there is a criminal penalty for transplanting a
 sunroof onto a bus!  Fact is, any given bus could have had a sunroof
 if the build order had specified it at the factory.  Swapping one on
 later isn't all that nasty of a thing to do as long as it's done in a
 workmanlike manner. &gt;&gt;

But don't you feel guilty, that you were not happy with how your bus was as
you got it? You want to make it something it is not, you will hurt its
feelings. Anyone have a bus with a good cargo door section? I want to make
mine a double door.
