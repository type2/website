Subject: Re: Jason - Bugpack

Jason, thanks for the tip on the steering, I'll check that out this
weekend. Also, for the input on Bugpack. A lot of their stuff looks like
the same stuff in the Empi catalog. I mentioned the Bugpack cause I just
got it today and remembered the charts. And yes, I use them mostly for
reference. The pictures of parts help me look for the right things at
the junkyards when the engines are strewn all over the ground. I have a
set of VDO gauges I'm adding - voltmeter, oil temp &amp; pressure. Got them
at PAW, better prices than EMPI or a couple of VW shops in the area. My
wife, Trudi, made a good find last week - a couple of yards of offwhite
vinyl for door panels at Walmart in the remnant piles. Good match on
color for the offwhite wheels. They also had gray, light green, blue &amp;
yellow.
