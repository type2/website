Subject: Testing gas tank senders
Date: Fri, 9 Mar 2001 09:58:25 -0500 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does anyone have a good way to test a gas tank sender?  The Bentley manual
has nothing on this, sure it tells you how to remove it, but that is pretty
obvious.  Also it mentions to take a pin out of a new one so the float can
drop, but I do not want to get a new one!

Apparently these run on some sort of Ohm load for the Fuel Gauge.   I
replaced my broken fuel gauge with a VDO unit made for VW (PN 301020 Cockpit
Style), but it does not read at all.  Tested with 7 Gal in the tank.  Also I
took Ohm readings at 7 gal and it was .72 Ohms and then empty and got .68
Ohms....  I think this is more of an anomaly that good data because the
range ought to be like 10.0(full)-0.73(empty) according to Jim at the VDO
help desk.  Jim was very helpful, but did not know the specifics of the VW
system, also it seems he is the only technical help person there. 

Thanks!
