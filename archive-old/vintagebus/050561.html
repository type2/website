Subject: Re: [VB] changing front beam

its really pretty straight forward. not to bad if you've got a helper to
help keep it balanced and guide it or work the jack when putting it in,
putting one back in by your self sucks.  a tie rod tool is nice for getting
the drag link off.

Subject: [VB] changing front beam


&gt; Hi List,
&gt; When I bought my crew cab a few months back, it had
&gt; already been lowered by the previous owner. For
&gt; several reasons I would like to raise it to stock
&gt; height. I bought a parts bus a while back and want to
&gt; use the front beam from it to do the &quot;raising&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone tell me how big a job it is to remove a
&gt; front beam from a 66 Standard and put it in my 63 crew
&gt; cab?? Any tips or &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; would also be
&gt; appreciated. I know a little about wrenching but would
&gt; like to hear from some of you to help build my
&gt; confidence or decide to have it done by a pro.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Pete
&gt; 63 Crew Cab - Buck
&gt;
