&lt;&lt; Why did my ex put 10mm bolts in to hold the cover on under the thermostat?
&gt;&gt;
Screws tend to vibrate out of this position.  Doubly so due to thier upside
down position.  Using 10mm headed bolts allows one to use lock washers and
improves the ability to increase the torque applied to these fasteners.  After
loosing two of these access plates, we turned to bolts and have not lost any
since then.
