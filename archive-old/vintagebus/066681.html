Subject: RE: [VB] bumper straightening?

Hi Chris in Texas,
I suppose they can follow the natural contour of the bumper from side to
side, and straighten the middle based on that.  I also would bet that if the
bumper is so far gone that they can't do this, they would probably tell you
at the time.

My bumper didn't have any really big dents, but a lot of little &quot;Parking Lot
Dents&quot;, which the guy at Bumper Boyz told me can be more time consuming to
straighten.

I think these guys will ship too, so even if you are out of town, this shop
may be able to help.

You can access their website at bumperboyz_dot_com.  They can probably answer a
lot of your questions.

Good luck,
Ed
