Subject: bus list photo album?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey, can we make a bus list photo album? Like a
yearbook or something?

I was at OCTO and I knew there were some listees
there, but I had no idea who they were. Short of a
secret handshake, we need some way of getting to
recognize each other/break the ice.

Okay, so I'm green (only been on since 8/00) but it
wouldn't hurt. Maybe even do a person/bus thing.

How/where can we do it?

What do you volks think?

With my luck there already is one. Luuuuurp!
