Hi Rex,
What you have is known as a mechanical oil pressure gauge.  The electrical 
oil pressure gauge type use electricity much like a eletrical fuel gauge 
does.  So only a wire needs to be run from the gauge to the sender in the 
engine.
  Like you say the mechanical pressure gauge is a pain due to having to 
carefully running a pressure line from the engine to the gauge in, on, or 
under the dash.  This pressure line is a Achlies heel due to possible rupture 
form too high of pressure or external damage under the bus and if too small 
of diameter pressure readings are delayed slightly.
