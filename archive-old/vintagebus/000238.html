&lt;&lt; What are the differences between the 36hp and 40hp stale-air warm-up 
systems?  Specifically, I would like to know the following:
 1. What, if any, differences exist between the 2 thermostats?  Length, 
temperature range, etc..
 2. Assuming there is a difference between the 2 systems, what is the 
easiest/quickest way to differenciate between the 2?
 
 The reason I ask is I know that the 40 hp &quot;throttle ring&quot; is supposed to be 
set to open wider when fully warmed up so I was wondering if any of the 
connecting rods/linkages are shorter/longer or if the thermostat is taller to 
allow for this. &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
So far as we can figure out is that sometime during the 25/36 era the 
throttle ring shaft, and tube got longer.  Then it looks like when the 40 HP, 
or maybe the Bastard 40 started the arm that clips to the top of the rod from 
the bellows got longer.  This would probably would be the only change needed 
for the wider set of the 40 HP throttle ring.
