Subject: 62 Flip seat SO-34 Westie for sale.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, wetwesties_at_yahoogroups_dot_com

Hi Volks,
We helped a fellow SO-34 owner about three years ago to find his Westie a 
front Flip seat.  He called us the other day to tell us he has decided to 
sell his bus for $3,500.00 due to lack of time.  He bought a new 1776cc 
engine for it a little over a year ago and has since only driven it about 40 
miles.  His name is Jack and he lives in Farmington, New Mexico (505) 
325-9797.  He has all the interior cabinets and even one or two extra.  We 
would love to get the extra cabinet/s as a finders fee!  ;-)
