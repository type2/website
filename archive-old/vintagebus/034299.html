	... It also cuts down on hearing folks yelling and honking at me as
they
&gt; scream by in their SUV's.
&gt;
Within 5 minutes of owning my bus, I hit a curb, blew a tire and lost my
battery (the sudden shock made it fall through the floor!). I jumped out of
the bus and started pushing it, swearing every step of the way. Just then a
yuppie pulls up, rolls down the window of his Lexus SUV and says, &quot;Hey man,
what year is that?&quot; Lot of affection out there for these beasts.
