Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch return spring/clutch lever questions..... 

Comparison, side by side. I will cut if I have to...The old lever has brass
brazing on it to reinforce, new one is welded and painted.
TO is centered right now, bushings feel ok.

Hi AL,
Is that comparison from tranny to tranny or perhaps by your memory of when
the engine and it's clutch system was bolted to the old tranny?  The clutch
system definitely adds more return to the clutch pedal.

&lt;&lt; I am replacing the spring, when i get the damn lever off!  &gt;&gt;

Well if it is stuck you really need it off so you do not have to do this
later when you do not have the time.  You might just want to cut off the
clutch throwout arm inside the bellhousing to get it out of the way.  Also
make sure whichever TO arm you use that it has a bead of weld around the
base
of each the TO arms or risk having them break off!  Make sure the TO bearing
is centered on the inputshaft to prevent ruining the TO arms, bearing and
even the pressure plate itself!  We have had to shim some of the TO shafts
to
one side to center the TO bearing and a tiny bit of arm bending can be used,
but too much bending raises the TO bearing upwards too much inrelation to
the
inputshaft.

&lt;&lt; Wish I checked that before trans install! Hindsight= 20-20 &gt;&gt;

Hindsight almost always is!   Eric&amp;Barb
