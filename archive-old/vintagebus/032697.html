Subject: RE: [VB]  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!

and this is shocking news how? 
when i worked at a vw shop i tried my hardest to dissuade people from
throwing their money away on those POS pulleys. even the brazil regular
ones are not worth it. usual reply: &quot;but they're so cheap&quot;
 i've seen them grenade into lotsa little pieces, leaving the driver stuck
in BFE. 
the only good solution, other than the price, is to buy a genuine GERMAN VW
pulley (12V), still available through VW, and other various VW shops. they
are about $29-34 depending, but they are far and away superior to any
aftermarket i've seen. plus, they actually weigh about twice the weight of
the POS aftermarket ones, too--more metal. plus, always use a new key in
the generator slot.
unfortunately, i don't know about 6V availability, or the outrageous price
for a correct pulley for a 38amp 68-71 bus style generator.
just remember: &quot;the bitterness of poor quality remains long after the
sweetness of low price is forgotten&quot;


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt; Just passing along a helpful tip...  Never buy the cheapo chrome
generator
&gt; &gt; pulleys made by Empi/Bugpack!!!  
  Open up the lid one more
&gt; &gt; time and hand turn the pulley shaft, but yet the belt pulley housing
will
&gt; &gt; not turn.  This is odd.  I thought I must have sheared the woodruff key,
&gt; &gt; big problem since I do not carry a spare (never heard of one breaking
&gt; &gt; before).  Take off the pulley/shims and find that the pulley woodruff
key
&gt; &gt; grove was totally reamed out!  Insert profanity here towards
&gt; &gt; Taiwan/China/EMPI/Bugpack :)  
&gt; &gt; Needless to say I was very disappointed in the quality of the metal in
the
&gt; &gt; chrome generator pulley parts.  I am now in the process of getting a
real
&gt; &gt; VW part.  Of course the local VW FLAPS was pushing the chrome job again
&gt; &gt; and I was like no way dude.
