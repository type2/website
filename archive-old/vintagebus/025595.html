Get ready, get set, GO!

Saw this ad in the Santa Rosa newspaper.

&quot;1960 21 window bus. 2nd owner. Not run. Some rust. B/ofr
over $3000. 707-795-0569. bef. 6/30.&quot;

Talked to the guy.  He's the 2nd owner, got it from his
stepdad.  Informed him it is a 23 window.  Had to make a
count of the windows to make him believe me.  Heres what I
know:

Middle seat gone.  Small finger size holes here and there.
The rest of the bus is complete and good shape, even the
headliner and rag top.  Says they are still water tight.  No
safaris. Has original bumpers including molding.  Stored in
garage.  Originally bought in Illinois.  The good
part......  he has all the original sales receipts and
brochures.  Even a few extra brochures and articles from the
early 60's as the father in law loved this bus and collected
all kinds of stuff.  Has a dent in a rear corner,
replacement metal is provided and was bought for it many
years ago.  He has all receipts for it from day one
including a quote from the original dealer offering $130 to
replace the &quot;bastard&quot; engine that came in these '60 busses.
Dealer says sorry, but he cant pay the whole $300
replacement cost.

This thing would be sitting in my garage right now if I
didn't have 5 projects in my yard now.  Someone please buy
it, mention my name, as I may get one of the brochures for
the sell  :)

You must have cash, and it must me sold by the end of the
month as he's moving back east.  So far just some local
yokels have looked at it with no promising sells.
