Subject: Re: soldering fuse box

&gt;is a basic 40W pencil iron ok(that is what I have, never seemed to get
&gt;hot enough) or there is the dual heat soldering gun from rat shack-$29.99.

A 40 W pencil will probably take forever on the fuse box clips.  I'd
use at least a 100 W iron for that job.  When I soldered the big brass
terminals on a headlight switch, I had a 140 W iron and that wasn't
really enough.  Higher-powered soldering irons often let you do _less_
damage to the materials that surround the metal you're soldering,
because you can get &quot;in and out&quot; quicker.

&gt;Then there is the area of contact where the two metal pieces &quot;squeeze&quot;
&gt;into the black fuse box thingy...should I solder here as well after
&gt;reconnecting everything...

Any place that you have two pieces of metal that conduct electricity
touching one another, solder them together.
