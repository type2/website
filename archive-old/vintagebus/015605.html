Subject: Have We Been Fooled by Berg?

Hey everybody:

I was casually looking through a back issue of Hot VWs earlier today, and I 
spotted this ad:

http://albums.photopoint_dot_com/j/View?u=273958&amp;a=2038326&amp;p=18189878&amp;Sequence=0

Everything I have ever read from Berg Enterprises says that remote oil 
coolers are evil and that the stock cooler should never be removed. What is 
up with this?  Have we been fooled?
