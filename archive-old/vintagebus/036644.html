I wanted to add my thanks to Ronnie as well.

He was very friendly and I got a nice pair of tinted windsheilds at the OCTO
meet this weekend.

My buddy also picked up a nice set of rebuilt linkpins, too.

Thanks to Ronnie at type2parts_dot_com, I got a set of RHD barndoor floors!
So far it's just the outter wedges, but he's going to try and
get Alan to make the center section too.
