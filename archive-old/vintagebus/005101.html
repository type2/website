to all on the list i got scamed by this guy (mr.kdf)  i got a listed as nos
36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for sure if it was nos,
but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking cosmilne on it.
not only is the case wasted in the thrust area but the rear main tore the
heck out of the line bore,   it is not evan usable, and the cosmoline was
fresh and wet,   i filed a report with ebay.   we will see where this goes.
