&lt;&lt; i have always been told to put at least 92 octane fuel in aircooled motors 
because it helps keep the valves cool from the low combustion rate. since 
there is no lead to protect the valves. My question is what would a higher 
octane (100, 110) protect it even more, or would it harm the engine in some 
way? &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
Using a higher octane fuel really does not keep valves cool.  You want to 
match your engine for the fuel you want to use.  We keep our CR down to 7.1-1 
or lower to prevent pinging with 87 octane that will damage the engine.  
During long hot trips during the summer we will then fuel up with the next 
higher octane which seems to bring down the engine temps an easy 10F.  We 
also have started recently to install new heads modified by Bear's VW machine 
in San Diego that have 9mm instead of the stock 7mm thick valve shafts.  This 
creates more bearing surface for the valves/guides to work with for better 
longevity and helps draw more heat out of the head and stem of the valves.  
Resulting in far less broken valves.  This is one of a couple of reasons we 
prefer adjusting our valves rather than running hydralic valves is that when 
an engine runs way too hot the valves will stretch a little like warmed up 
taffy.  Causing the valve lash to get smaller and smaller which can not be 
easily noticed with hydralics.  We tend to get our engines to settle/wear in 
and only have to adjust a valve or two every tune up after the first 
10-20,000 miles.  Eric&amp;Barb
