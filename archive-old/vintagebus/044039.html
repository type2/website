Perhaps he is making the Westy clamps now, but a year and a half ago he
wasn't.  He was kind enough to send me what he thought would work.  It was
not sized properly to do the job.  It was too tall.
If someone contacts him and finds that he does have them..I'd be
interested to see how it actually works out.
