Hi Scott &amp; Jason,
Check your local VW shops or talk directly to Claude's Buggies about thier 
Schadek oil filter/pump.  Schadek has made stock VW pumps for decades and has 
continued the same quality.  The only problem with these is the filter is 
mounted to the left of the engine case.  With a stock muffler with the heat 
riser tube coming out of the front of the muffler the filter will not fit in 
there!  So really these were designed only for header mufflers.  We have been 
cutting angling down slightly and rewelding the support/lines between the 
pump cover and filter mount to make this clear the heat riser tube.  Even if 
we ran header mufflers would do the same to allow use of stock muffler when 
possibly the only part availible on long road trips.   Eric&amp;Barb
