Hi Tim &amp; Clementine,
Aluminum if of the proper alloy is much more resistant to oxidation than 
steel, but it is far from corrosion proof.  Stainless steel of the proper 
alloy will far outlast aluminum and steel.  The big problem with aluminum is 
that to make these frames as strong as steel one has to generally double the 
thickness of the aluminum!  Which hopefully is the reason for the special 
glass to frame seals.
