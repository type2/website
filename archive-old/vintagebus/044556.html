Subject: 356 pulley setup---
To: silent_at_beatricene_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

NQ---
I read of your 356 pulley setup on the list and was wondering if you could 
possibly tell me the specs of the pulley, diameter? (did you just change the 
crank pulley or the gen pulley also?), belt size, where you got it, and how 
you like it? What are the benefits if using in a 1641 w/ a T4 cooler?  Would 
this do it well as far as cooling.

Sorry, but I've got a friend who is going for this setup who is off the list. 
If youve got the time, I'd love a little guidance!
How did it do on your weekend trip?

Thanks alot- Pete
