&gt;Isn't it near the ashtray, on top of the dash?  I want to put one in 
&gt;mine, mainly for accessories -- not sure I want to drill the dash, but
&gt;if I do, I want it to be in the right place.

I have seen them on either the left or right of the ashtray.  If you
really don't want to drill holes, use the stock inspection lamp socket
holes - look up at the bottom side of the parcel shelf on either side
of the defroster duct.  Only trouble is that these are sized for the
European accessory/lighter socket.  I guess you could get a Euro
socket, install it, and make an adapter cord from a Euro plug and a
US socket.

&gt;I have a bunch of stock lighters with roached elements, but the 
&gt;sockets themselves are fine.

Some car parts stores sell just the elements.  Sometimes you can
get them without knobs even - if one fits your knob then you're
set.  Otherwise you might have to get one with a knob and change
the knob out.
