&gt;  I haven't heard of westy recovering the front seats, though I suppose it is
&gt; possible, I suspect it was one by a po when the seats got funky.

  the only time i have seen westfalia redo the front seat was on the flip seat
front bench,which is a completely different bench altogether.(the back rest of
the front bench was mounted to the bottom cushion via two big metal brackets
and
the backrest flipped up horizontal to become a bunkbed)on these they
used the same fabric on the bench as they did on the bed.so that would have
been
late 50's very early 60's westies
with the flip front bench.(on these models westfalia removed the top of the
bulkhead for access to the bunkbed).
they also lined the front cab with wood panels instead of the press
board.slept
4.pretty kewwwlll!!!!!

ya...  I've seen those westy seat covered flip seats in early westys.    nice
set up for camping.     I was thinking 1967, though.  guess i could have been
clearer.
