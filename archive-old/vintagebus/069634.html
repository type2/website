Subject: On the road! As always carb questions.

Picked up my bus from Lehamns' Auto in PA on Rt100. Tim did good work, got a
bus running that I couldn't. Seems all my carbs were clogged to bad
internally. I am going to ultrasound them to try and fix that in the future.
Got a new 30/31 (there goes original stock I was after). Engine is running
now, drove it 30 miles home, and to work today, good power and cool running,
I could hold dipstick forever afterward. Will get empirical readings asap
with laser infra thermometer. Gentle driving and lots of oil changes to
follow before long drives.

The low compression/high quench and ENGLE 100 cam resulted in huge
Hydrocarbon levels at idle 3000ppm. CO is 3.8, and tailpipe calculated AF
ratio is 17-18. Jets are stock 120 60 65 and I think a 135z? I'll have to
tear up my outher 30/31 to check the ones they come with. Throttle screw had
to be bumped to get a 900 rpm idle speed. Air cleaner is stock 66 bus.
I am think ing I need a larger air correction jet to get more atomization of
charge for the 1600 with 7.1:1 compression with this engle 100 cam, to help
get a cleaner burn at idle, with more conrol by the bypass screw for idle
speed, and closer to the magic 14.7 AF at the tailpipe. After some breakin,
I want to try going for this.

Questions:
If an idle speed produced by bypass screw is insiffcient for an engine with
this cyl volume and cam profile, does that entail I need more air AND fuel?
Could a 30/31 be too small to be ideal? I am strongly considering that a
larger air correction jet is in order, perhaps to allow for larger jets as
well. Seems I need a leaner/more atomized idle burn to bring CO and
hydrocarbons down, and for a naturally faster idle, with better/more control
by bypass screw.
Running of the main on thottle seems just wonderful, so I am close to a good
set up here, as hydrocarbons decrease into the high 1000ppm, and CO drops
some. Can't expect too clean with the cam profile of the engle 100.
Power and climbing hill at 37mph in third is good, a queit, responsive and
cool running engine.
Is the stock aircleaner too limiting?
Does the 30/31 Bocar/Brosl produce the correct vac signal for the later
samll can Bosch dizzy that is still available new? Ie, is the vac signal the
same as a PICT 34?
Will an ENGLE 100 cam produce enough vaccum for the carb to run the signal
to this dizzy, or should I remain on my 009?


Wish I had my own Sunpro to cut down on the costs of getting the print outs.
:)

All in all, not too rich or too lean to be dangerous, but looking to tune
better, even if a different/dual carbs might be in the future...

On that questions, do Kadrons mount to the SP intake for a 66 T3 with dual
carbs?

Thanks for all the help everyone, feels good to drive again after all those
months.
