Subject: Re: [VB] speaking of tires - Dangerous!

I just checked for the business card info that I had for an old guy who was
cutting white walls at the Scottsdale Barrett-Jackson auction. It was more
years ago than I wish to think. 

I have been warned since then that cutting white walls is no longer recommended
and is flat out dangerous!

NEVER attempt to cut white walls into a modern radial tires as there is
virtually no side wall thickness. Cutting the side wall of bias ply tires is
not recommended either based on the concept that OG white wall tires had an
extra side wall thickness built in to compensate within the narrow area of the
thin white wall stripe.
My details might be muddled but root thing that I am conveying is that I have
been warned against having white walls cut or altered.
Compromising the factory engineering and violating the warranty are two reasons
to avoid it. Basic safety of yourself and your passangers is another.
