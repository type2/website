&lt;&lt; I have a doghouse cooler from a pile of stuff and a running bus without
one.
 What do I need to buy other than gaskets, a fat fan and shroud to suit. I
 had the info and lost the file... &gt;&gt;
Hi Barry,
You need the 34 or 35 mm wide fan (Inside measurement.), 2:1 lower pulley, all
of the various cooling tin pieces (5 pieces?), cooler, cooler stand,
thermostatic flaps for the doghouse shroud, seals (4?), and 1/2&quot; wide
household foam door seal tape for the dog house tin.  Eric &amp; Barb
