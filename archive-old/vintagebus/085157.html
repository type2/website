Craig asked:

 what am i missing? or is the buyer missing a screw?
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually there were 2 buyers with screws loose:
keith1978cars and cossievanman

And the seller is a little misleading...... he says it fits 49-67. 
Wrong, up to the end of 63 the ratio is different for 15&quot; wheels.
A bus that used 15&quot; wheels will have W0,77 stamped on the back.
64-67 has a different ratio for 14&quot; wheels.
A bus that used 14&quot; wheels will have W0,80 stamped on the back.
