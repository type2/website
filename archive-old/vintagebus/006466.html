    I live 20 minutes away from Solvang. I believe they have 2 shows during
the year. I went to the last one at  the Firestone Vineyard and allot of
people turned out for it. I am not sure when the next one is but when it
comes up I will email the list is anyone is interested.

PS: Solvang is 40 minutes north from Santa Barbara. It is a quaint little
Danish Town  I guess you could say nostalgic.
