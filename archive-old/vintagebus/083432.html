Subject: Re: [VB] poor milage

Ronnie,
I would keep monitoring it closely for 500-1000 miles. While monitoring recheck the tune specs. After it wears in a little, things should improve.
My 2 cents.
Dave
&gt; my daily driver panel has a new(aprox 1200 miles) 1600 sp in it that's only 
&gt; getting 15 mpg mixed use(about 1/2 and 1/2). i'm running a new 30-pict 1 and a 
&gt; stock used 69 bus distributor, which were both on the previous 1600 sp engine 
&gt; installed in the bus last summer. with that engine i got 19-20 mpg mixed use 
&gt; running that exact same carb and distributor, and this was in the summer with 
&gt; the safari's open full tilt. 
&gt; my rings haven't seated yet, because it'll still chug slowly down my 
&gt; driveway(steep grade) when i get out to lock the gate with the bus in gear. 
&gt; could this be bringing my milage down?
