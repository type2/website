It's winter in the Midwest and since a large portion of the U.S. is now in
freeze box mode, the young ones might be looking for something to do.  It
was with this in mind that let me to create a website tonight.

When my brother I were kids, we would make these littles gizmos.  Winter may
not be the time for what could be considered a &quot;craft&quot; but if any of you
have kids that like to make this kind of stuff, let them have a looksee at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/pcturbine/paperturbine.html

Yeah, laugh if you must but kids can have a lot of fun making stuff like
this.  Just put them in front of a fan and let them watch their whirlygigs
spin!
