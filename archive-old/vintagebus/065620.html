Subject: Pulley Woes

Hey Listee's,
I could use a little help. I had a wobbly, nasty looking double crank AC
pulley on my '66. I pulled it off to replace it with the correct single
pulley. With the correct single crank pulley on, the belt will not line
up with the alternator pulley. The alternator pulley sticks out about
.625 from the crank pulley. The belt rode on the outside of double
pulley so it lined up fine. There is a washer/shim that is on the shaft
of the alt that causes the pulley to be moved out. But that is only
about .125 thick. I also can't get the threaded piece (don't know what
it is called) off of the alternator shaft, that the pulley rest on, so I
can't remove the washer/shim. I tried holding the fan nut but that
busted loose first. Vehicle history, just in case it
matters...........has been converted to 12 volt. It is not the original
engine. &quot;I was told&quot; that it is a 1600 out of a Type 3. Any suggestion
on either problem?
