Subject: Re: [VB] BBB7 &quot;Boat Tour&quot;

Not the Minnow? You'd be a pretty good Giligan and VW Howard the perfect 
Skipper. George Lyle as the Professor of course. Anybody else have the rest of 
the cast?

&gt;  See ya there!
&gt;   Lou in Havasu
&gt; PS. No the boat is not the &quot;Minnow&quot; and it's not a &quot;three hour tour&quot;!
