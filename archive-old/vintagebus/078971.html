First make sure timing isn't advanced too far which could be a cause of hard

 Looking for some possible reasons for a reluctance to start
&gt; when it is warm.  The motor runs great( although I think it is too
&gt; rich), but does not like to start hot.  I have to hold the throttle WO
&gt; and then it barely comes to life.  Its like its flooded.
