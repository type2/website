Subject: Re: [VB] Beginner's Mistake...Help!

do you have a digital camera there?   It MIGHT be a starter booster,  or 
something else, but without a better desciption it is hard to tell.   size shape 
colour?  were the number you quoted from the regulator or the mystery thing?

much attention when unplugging wires, and now I can't figure things out. If 
this was 
a regular bus installation it wouldn't be such an issue, but my bus has an 
extra 
electrical box next to the voltage regulator (Bosch, 6V unit, part # 0 332 
003 016)to 
and from which several cables go. I have lost track of what goes where, and I 
am only 
 -What exactly is this part? Could it be an additional part for Westfalias? 
Susan's 66 
 Dormobile has something very similar, but not quite the same shape (hers has 
two 
 cylinders next to the voltage regulator).
