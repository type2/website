&gt;  I believe that Todd is right about the USA spec for busses and bugs, butI think '60 was the last year that semaphores were available in Europe.
&gt; I'm fairly certain that's true for Bugs, figure Buses would probably follow suit(??).
&gt;  So...now I'm curious. Does anybody out there have a '61 Bus with semaphores?
&gt; Thanks, Dave
