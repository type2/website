&lt;&lt; Anyway, I know Dan personally and can't help but think that there is a
 misunderstanding somewhere.   &gt;&gt;

 I couldn't agree more,  I too know Dan personally and have had many buisness 
dealings with him, always to my satisfaction!   Dan's trying to  make some 
bucks  and I've never known him to misrepresent something he has for sale or 
fail to come through on a deal.  I have complete confidence in any dealing 
with Dan.
