Subject: Carb Adjustment on 6v system
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What is the best way to get the carb adj right on a 6v
system (w/o a tach)?  I have a H30/31 PICT Carb and a
1300 era vac advance distributor on a DP 1600 timed to
7.5 degrees BTDC.

Having no tach, I usually increase the idle screw to
rev about 2x normal.  Then I adjust the mixture screw
down till almost stalling and then up till rpm's peak
and start to tail off.  Then I turn it back down till
the rps's start to go down again.  In other words, at
the bottom end of the peak.  Then I turn idle back
down to the point I am comfortable with.

As I don't have a 6v tach (anyone?) I do this all by
sound.  Is there a better way?

As always, sound advice is greatly appreciated!
