In my garage there's a really ugly, rusty '54 RHD deluxe, parked
next to a 911.  

I just moved into this house, and most of my free time has been
spent getting the garage ready to work on the '54.  Most of my
household stuff isn't even unpacked yet!

Last night I was up until past midnight installing a T-bar ceiling.
The ceiling was unfinished and I found the low level of light
unacceptable for working on the car.  The materials for the ceiling
cost me about $200 from home depot. Next I'm going to install a few
recessed flourescent fixtures.   

I missed the Busses in the Shop shindig doing insulation and
sheetrock.  

I've also created a little &quot;shed&quot; for my air compressor and moved it
outside.  It's basically a movable cover built out of 2x4 and plywood,
with insulation for sound, appropriate venting, and even a real roof!
Last weekend I had a 1/2&quot; 15' hose fabbed to go between the compressor
and the house.  I have 1/2&quot; pipe going thru the wall to the air dryer
on the inside.  Between the compressor and the house I'm using 3/8&quot;
fittings, with a 1/4&quot; connector outside the house to have access to air
in the backyard.  Inside, I have both 3/8&quot; and 1/4&quot; connectors.  I'm
converting my big impact gun to 3/8&quot; to take advantage of the extra
air available.

When the compressor kicks on, it's barely audible in the garage,
and not very loud outside, either.  I'm still working on ways to quiet
it down outside, so as to annoy the neighbors as little as possible.

I built two workbenches, one 8' x 2', and 5' x 2' with a 16&quot; x 2' &quot;L&quot;
extension.

Shelving for days all around the garage, the top shelves are about 7' 
off the ground, so they're out of the way, and it keeps my short 
friends from pawing thru all my parts.  The shelves are full of those
stackable plastic boxes with misc bus and porsche parts.
