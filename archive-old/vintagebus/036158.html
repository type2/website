In a message dated 98-12-12 10:44:48 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; On my '66 standard bus one of my anti-roll bar (as we say in England)
clamps
 is cracked, and I'm getting a new pair of clamps sent to me.
  The guy who sold them wished me &quot;good luck&quot; in an ominous way when I said I
 wanted to fit them myself. So now of course I'm in a panic and wondering
 whether to take it to a garage.
  How hard is it? Does it need special tools? Anyone got the time to write
 some instructions? &gt;&gt;
Hi James,
The main thing you need to do is to jack up the front beam so the tires are
off of the pavement and sit it on jack stands.  Then the best way to
understand your problem is to remove the clamps you have.  Take care to note
that the lock plates that secures the antisway bar and all of it's parts are
tapered and must be driven off in the proper direction after the retaining tab
has been bent back.  Then to install the new clamps it is advised that you
grease the snot out of all the parts to prevent rusting and use a set of
pltiers or better yet a vise grip to hold the clamp ends closed enough to
install the lock plates back in.  In the end if you take carefull note on how
it comes apart, you will find that the job will go very easily.  Eric &amp; Barb
