Howdy Volks,

This discussion made me wonder, does having heater boxes
help cooling?  Significantly?  I have no heater boxes,
and my fan outlets are blocked off, rear tin holes sealed.
One thing that definitely comes to mind is that without
heaters, there is no lower tin.

My oil temp routinely reaches 250, and has hit the 300 mark,
but there doesn't appear to be much to do about it.  I wish 
I could make myself believe in the vent cowlings enough to 
try them.  Apologies if we've already discussed that to death.
