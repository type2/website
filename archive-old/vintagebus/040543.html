Reading the website (www.acvwjyro_dot_com) before it disappeared, I got the 
impression that the reason they were forced to close was not because of VW 
lawyers coming after them for trademark violation, it was the local 
community getting them on a technicality that they &quot;had&quot; to accept credit 
cards from customers to operate legally within that community.  Turns out 
that the junkyard didn't have generate enough revenue to pay all the 
associated costs that come with accepting credit card customers.

Not that it matters anyway, just thought I'd try to clear the air so that 
those VW lawyers won't come after some of you for slandering them for 
something they weren't involved in ;-)

&gt;The only problem I have with that is that VW is persecuting the very people
&gt;who are celebrating the marque by prosecuting them. Why are they pursuing
&gt;this so vigorously? I would be willing to bet it's their lawyers out there
&gt;trying to create as many billable hours as they can. Most of the time, when 
&gt;I
&gt;find lawyers getting blamed for things, they usually deserve it, and more.

&gt; &gt; &lt;  it looks like indeed, the lawyers possibly
&gt; &gt; won again.&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please . . . don't blame it on the lawyers. They have no choice. It is
&gt; &gt; the law itself and the interpretation of that law by the courts.
