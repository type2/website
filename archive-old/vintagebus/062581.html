Subject: Rhino Liner

I two have had two of my crewcabs in the past coated with bed liner
material. One with Rhino liner and the other with Line-x. Both are different
and here is what I have noticed:
Rhino liner is thicker, it protects your bed better from dents. though
because it is thicker, if you have the gates sprayed on the under side lip
you may have some problems closing and latching them. Also it you have a
tilt for your truck make sure they don't spray the loops on the back of the
cab. If they do you will have to remove it in order to put the canvas back
on. other features I have noticed with Rhino liner is that it is a very good
noise suppressor, also with a little prep work you can have them spray your
floor boards which hides any patch work you have done.

Line-x is a thinner material and can be applied easily to both the
undersides of the gates as well as lightly to the body loops. In black when
it is sprayed on your seat pedestal it looks like an original mat almost. It
does not have the same sound dampening abilities that the thicker rhino does
though.

As far as lining the inside of the bed I have seen both diamond plate as
well as plywood. I personally would use marine grade plywood and either coat
it in a 2 part epoxy finish or have it sprayed with the bed liner material
as well.
