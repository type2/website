Im not sure about FL, but in Texas all Ive ever had to
do was go to the main DOT in my county w/vin # (plates
too if I got em) Tell the nice person behind the
counter that your thinkin about buying this vehicle, &amp;
want to make sure there is NO LIENS on the title. They
run a check, you get a dot matrix readout on the car
showing owner &amp; address, previous owner, last county &amp;
state it was registered, if its stolen, or if there is
any liens. &quot;Thankyou, that will be $2.56&quot;. Then you ask
the kind person if they can give also give ya a &quot;title
transfer slip&quot;:) Now go home, get on the computer, find
directions to the OWNERS house, &amp; start knockin on
doors. Get ther signature on all the right papers, in
the RIGHT PLACES. Then go get the title transfered into
your name:) Be sure &amp; ask for some of those &quot;Real
Pretty Shiney Plates&quot; too:) Now if that dont get ya
thru, ask me about the &quot;Power of Attorney&quot; form:) That
one get a little deeper:o
