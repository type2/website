Fred:
Thank you for the information re: propane heater.
I would like this thing to work as much as you do.
and the price is most reasonable, too.
However, i remain skeptical, and would like to have
someone else test it and report back that they
survived.
My local propane wizard says it's a really bad idea,
the oxygen depletion sensors to date have been
provided for the burner , and not for the camper.
there was a recent post somewhere near that thread
indicating another problem which i have experienced
personally- the creation of water vapor. everything,
like sleeping bag, you, and every surface inside the
vw totally soaked, even on a dry nite.
i've got the gas heater mounted in front of the steering
column, w/ heat directed between my knees, and ducted
into the vents above to make defroster functional.
i'm in western New York, it's cold enough to heat at night
except for one week at the end of july.
i've not gone camping at times because of this lack of
comfort, and have a zero bag, but just getting up in the
morning can mess up your whole day.
i've lately considered an electric blanket on inverter 110
and  a radiant propane heater for when you are awake.
and so does it have a kill switch for when it falls over ?
the vw has a lot of synthetic materials which are extremely
toxic when ignited.
and your feet and or blankets could easily knock it over if
not careful . and i'm considerably less careful when i'm
sleeping .
if this heater would allow for safe camping, i'm really hot
to get one. and what's the deal w/ a 1 lb. bottle ? i'd prefer
to install semi-permanent in a cabinet, and pipe in fuel...
