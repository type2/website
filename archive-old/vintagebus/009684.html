&gt;Clara, thank you for following up on this post, you are right, and I hope I
haven't given too many people the wrong impression on this procedure, as I
said, I didn't have the manual in front of me when I posted the
message...further to the procedure, the Bentley manual seems to be
indicating that the stop should be adjusted AFTER the rod is correctly
positioned, to conform to the correctly adjusted clearance.

When I got under the bus to perform the adjustment, I discovered that the
pushrod had actually been unscrewed from the clevis and was just resting
against the threads.
After taking a couple of minutes to contemplate the safety implications of
this, I removed the entire assembly, cleaned all the parts, re-tapped the
threads on the clevis and the pushrod (8mm w/ 1.0 pitch) then greased and
re-assembled the pushrod/clevis assy and re-installed it into the master
cylinder. With that accomplished and after ensuring that the adjustment is
correct, I tapped the stop into position.
When I think that the P.O. of this bus bought it to drive to Florida from
Illinois (and abandoned it when he spun the #4 rod bearing)...I almost get
chills, so far, the drag link has been replaced due to EXTREME steering
slack, and the brake system has held together by sheer luck. I'm no
perfectionist, but this is stuff that has to be correct to make the bus
roadworthy. I learned a lesson from a long-time bus pilot in my neighborhood
when he told me early on &quot;the engine's the least of your concerns&quot;.
I'm lucky that I paid attention.
Sorry to carry on so long...

re the MC activating rod:
&gt;
&gt;if you are under the bus you should be able to pull the pedal down and see
&gt;the rod going into the MC?   It should move, as John wrote, about 1mm.
&gt;when is doesn't, you adjust the rod, not the stop, as John suggested.
There
&gt;is a lock nut on it, usually rusty, but with a bit of patience, or a
luckily
&gt;unrusty bus, not compicated.   you put  a vise grip on the rod and a wrench
&gt;on the nut , loosen the nut and adjust the rod.  when the space is 1mm,
&gt;tighten down the lock nut (did you remeber to grease the threads?)
