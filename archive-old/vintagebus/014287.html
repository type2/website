&gt;Dawn and Todd are not likely to appear on the list(s) again. I know *I'd*
&gt;be too embarassed to. Having been a small business owner, I know the pain
&gt;they're feeling. It's not an excuse for doing people wrong, but Steve
&gt;Lashley is right that they're probably worse off than the people left with
&gt;less money and no parts. Again, no excuse.

I'm going to be perhaps the dissenting opinion here apparently but although I
take the original posters word that he has been put off for about 3 weeks
now, frankly no one else has voiced having a current problem with PLF, so until
things settle out and we see whether he receives resolution to his problem,
let's not jump to conclusions.  I agree with Joe here on most of this, on both
accounts they were crafts people who did good work for a lot of people then
maybe grew too fast.  Apparently Todd definitely screwed over quite a few people
and that is sad, wrong, and fraudulent.  But until we get some definite information
that Dawn is folded, absconding with money, etc., lets not jump to conclusions.
A one person shop is just that, one person, real things do happen, people
get sick, hell people die,  I hope that Don or whoever it was who had the problem
receives a speedy rectification and an explanation to the delay and if he does
I assume he will have the integrity to post it to the list.  And if he is taken, of
course I hope he pursues any legal methods he can to obtain satisfaction in
the matter.  If PLF has a reasonable explanation I'd be more than happy to hear
it, as would a number of others who had probably figured on sending business
that way eventually.

(the better happier)
