&gt; I seams to me like 185/70 R14 was the closest thing to the original 7.00
&gt; R14.  Given that, what tires have you all found (brand etc.) that have
&gt; looked correct/good on a all stock bus?  I do not what to go with
&gt; bias-ply and do not want white walls.

185 good, /70 bad.  The stock bias tires had almost a 100 section ratio,
which isn't available in modern radials.  The closest you will get is a
185R14, which will have a section ratio of 82-85.  I've had good luck with
Bridgestone RD603V tires in 185R14 load range D
