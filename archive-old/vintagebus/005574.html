Hello Everyone!

    Has Anybody heard anymore news on the Radio's that were be reproduced. I
believe the gentlemen that were making them were making them for 6v buses
and they were in the works on a 12v version as well. Has anyone heard more
on the 12v version's and were they going to fit the 67 radio plate?


Thanks in advance!
