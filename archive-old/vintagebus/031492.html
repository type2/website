Subject: Re: [VB] Excuse me/Splittie gun racks?

&gt; This brings up a topic I've been wondering about.  I don't believe I've ever seen a splittie doublecab or singlecab sporting a gun rack.  Since I live in the Old South maybe I should think about getting one.  Anybody have any recommendations or experiences to share?  Will an off-the-shelf gunrack do, or is it necessary to have one custom-made?    B^)

I could just see my DC now humming down the 405 fwy in SoCal, giving the CHP a heart attack with its recently fitted gun rack and tools that look suspiciously like rifles.

No thanks, ... things like that get turned around here.

I was sitting in my family room one morning watching (3am) TV when I heard something out by the cars in the driveway.  Having a security cam aimed at the DC, I changed channels and checked the cars.  Imagine how high my heart leapt when I saw someone messing with my wife's car.  Keeping a cool head, I then looked out the side window and saw that it was
just a couple of boys that knew my daughter toilet papering the house.  I slooooowly walked out of the house and right behind both of them admiring their work.  (Got my DC good).  Next thing they heard was me in a nice loud &quot;GOTCHA!!!!&quot;.  One kid was SO startled that he dropped his backpack (and who knows what else) and set the world's record for the 1
mile run.  The other stood there, white as a sheet and just couldn't think of anything to say.

Now here's what all this has been leading up to....
I told him that I didn't mind them TPing the house but the cars were a bit much, and it was a good thing that I had not come running out with my shotgun thinking it was a car theft going on, especially since it was 3am.

Next thing, I start getting calls from parents (completely unrelated), &quot;did you pull a shotgun on johnny?&quot;

Imagine how that story got blown out of proportion.

For the record, the shotgun remained LOCKED up during the incident and never came close to being unlocked.

It was a pain cleaning all the TP off the DC.
