OK I have a flush shaft mechansim, So what you are saying I need an outside 
handle to work the mechansim from the inside?  Where can I get an handle 
like this?  This is going on a 66 Westy


&gt;the door that has the outside handle on it the outside handle square shaft
&gt;goes through the door mechanism, out the inside :) and the inside handle 
&gt;fits
&gt;on it.  If the shaft is about flush with the mechansim you have a cargo 
&gt;door
&gt;outside handle and it does not take and inside handle.
