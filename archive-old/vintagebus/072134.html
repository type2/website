Subject: Dave's Not Here

  Dear Friends-
  I need your help.
  Three weeks ago, I found myself in the middle
  of a legal situation which caused me to lose
  my home. I am the victim of false allegations,
  and only an attorney can save my remaining assets,
  my collection of volkswagen buses,parts,and tools.
  One of the complaints was that I have these things,
  and did not pursue the almighty dollar and a deed.
  I was rendered homeless and penniless in an instant.
  I have not been able to keep up with the list, and
  the time I have spent with you folks is another one
  of many complaints.
  I have learned to beg for food and shelter.
  I need your cash donations to my email address at paypal,
  but I need your replies even more. I miss all of you.
  This can NOT become a thread, please do NOT respond here.
  Dave \X/
