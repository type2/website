hey Volks:

Just a reminder that he deadline for HCBF T-shirts is July 1st.
A few people have emailed that their checks are in the mail late, and with
the 4th of July Holiday, I am going to wait to give the order numbers to the
printer until July 7th.

T-shirts will not be available at the event, so if you want yours, be sure
to get your order in the mail soon.

order form: http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~contecmidwest/page3.html

Thanks Ya'll and we'll see you in a few weeks.
- Buddah
