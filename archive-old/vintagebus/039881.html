hello

I am currently in the process of pulling my trans all done except the 
coupling bolt is being a pain.

I was wondering how hard is it to put a new  wiring harness in.  How well 
are the harnesses labled? Do they have very good instructions? To me it 
looks like it is an issue of taking your time?

The reasons i am wanting to rewire it are i am planning to come out for the 
OCTO show(don't want any fires), and the wiring is a mess
I also have what looks like an old bosch 6 volt coil wired into my wiring.  
What is it there for (is it a booster for the old wiring?)

on another note i am thinking about going to the detroit auto show.  Are any 
other listees planning on going and when?

thanks alot
