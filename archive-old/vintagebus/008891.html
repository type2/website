Subject: Re: [VB] Powdercoating colors?

&gt;My question relates to the factory colors of the wheels ..... &gt;correct has
yet to be validated. The specific wheel color still eludes me.
&gt;wanted to know if any of you have tried colors from any of these companies
and found them to be close enough to stock that a difference cannot be

easily seen.

So far comon thought for Silver Weiss matching powder coat color is either
Traffic White (RAL 9016)
or
Signal White (RAL 9003)
Altho Someone mailed me that they thought Signal white seemed to bright.
Oh and then theres Clara's 'mystery' color she used, which was a damn 'close
match'. But for some reason she wouldnt release the information to us.
