A day or so ago I posted the link to a guy's page where he tells how to set
up an electrolysis tank and using his page for inspiration, I built one for
myself to derust a badly corroded rim.  When I got home from work tonight,
my mailbox had several requests for pictures so I ran back outside with the
digital camera, snapped pix under the porch light, hopped on the moped and
rode the mile back to work, used the computer to transfer the pix, and came
zipping back home.  I've thrown together a really crappy page on what the
tank looks like after 18 to 20 hours of electrolysis - I haven't even pulled
the rim out yet to see how it looks.  You will notice that the tank has 4
posts around the perimeter which works _FAR_ better than 2.  The object is
to get a positive field surrounding the object to be derusted while giving
the object itself a negative charge - all without shorting anything out.  A
short would ruin the effect and probably your battery charger.  The page is
picture intensive so be forewarned.  The URL for it is at:
http://home.ispi_dot_net/bie/elassley/derustpage

BTW:  I added lots of salt to the water to help conductivity.  It just means
I'll have to clean the daylights out of the rim to prevent further rusting.
Notice in the bottom of the tank that there is a couple of inches of junk.
The water itself has now taken on a mild slime/gel texture - very weird.

If anyone has any questions after checking my page and Bill's Electrolysis
page, please email me and I'l try to help you as best as I can.

Thanks for reading - I'm off to check my rim!!!
