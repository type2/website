I think this boils down to the golden rule....  Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

Ken, from what I understand, owns the type2 domain and pays for all the technical upkeep and related expenses.  We must respect that.  This is a FREE list and we should understand Ken's desire to limit his risks.  Yes, WE make the list what it is by sharing our experiences and technical advice, but we do not own or have rights to any of it as a whole.

Anything we post should be considered public knowledge and without copyright regulations.  But subject to the hosts direction and control since it is their butt on the line.....  How Bob H. could put a little copyright on all of his public posts is still not clear to me since it should be public domain, but that is neither here nor there. 

I say thanks to Ken and all the others who keep this board up and running through their time, effort, and money!   When we pay $5 a month for this service I will consider it more of a democracy, until then it is not up to the list community at large.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
