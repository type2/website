Hi Mike,
Good to hear all turned out well!  Definitely whenever anyone R&amp;R a wheel 
even if it is the same wheel going back in the same place the torque must be 
rechecked in less than five miles if properly torqued wrenched.  If tightened 
just by hand one must recheck in about 1/2 mile and again at about five 
miles.  
  For not paying better attention we will have to orginize a spanking event 
for you at one of our VW meets when you finally get out this way with your 
bus!  ;-)
