Hi all,

Last night, I put in my rebuilt starter and got my bus (ok, my 58 ghia but
I'd rather ask this group than others) started... it started right up after
a few pumps of the pedal and idled ok.  But, when I took it out of the
garage, it seemed to run a bit rough at steady velocities.  When
accelerating between about 2500 and 3500 rpm, the engine runs fine and pulls
fine.... reach a constant velocity again, and it begins to hesitate a bit
again.  The idle is set a bit low but I wouldn't expect this to cause such a
problem.

So, out comes the idiot book and I find that it can be (duh) either junk in
the carburetor bowl, bad timing, or the valves need to be adjusted.
However, I want to take the car out tomorrow and only have about an hour
tonight to work on it so I would like to get all your ideas as to what I
should actually look at first.

BTW, it's a stock 36 hp engine.

TIA

David
