I would like to figure out a way to do this too.  I have asked a friend to help me try to do this.  We haven't gotten very far but were going to make a metal template on his CNC machine and sand blast them on.  This was for the early Sekurit glass, which looks blasted to me.  I think the Sigla glass uses a different process, but I am not sure what that is.  Any of the experts here have any info on this?  I would love to try this since Sigla glass is notorious for separating and the rear window seems to be the hardest to find in any brand, so that makes this window twice as hard to find.  

Any ideas?
Richard

If anyone out there has any ideas on how to make the Sigla emblem
please email me.
