Subject: Re: [VB] bbbrake adjustments

WW sells the rear leaf springs for 54-77 brakes.

You may be able to modify them for the fronts as well, never done this
though. I have replaced the rears. Its pretty easy, just pry the broken
spring off with a screwdriver and chisel the top of the adjuster mount where
the spring goes to remove some of the metal holding the old leaf spring and
then tap the new spring into the recess.

You just answered your own question! Those are your options, though you
might possibly be able to find spring material and drill out the rivets
and mount new springs with 8-32 fasteners (works on hubcap clips too).

&gt; and the E-brake functional.  Do I have to find new backing plates, or can
I
&gt; just find the little springs and mount them?
