Hi ya'll i just got a case and was having a little problem with the number.
it is #  0442053 
now thier is the vw stampping and what apears to be a faint H to the far left 
of it.
the engine # is stamped clearly, now i am unsure if the H is part of the # or 
not.
as it is not at the same plane or stamping depth.
also could the zero in the begining of the # be a O?
i was told it was a 1300 FWIW.

thanks
joe
