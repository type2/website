&gt;Anyway I pulled into the neiborhood and up to a light, when I looked down 
&gt;at the gauge it know said the tank was full. [...]  Anyway the light
&gt;changes and I take my foot off the break and the needle drops back
&gt;down to where it should be.

My first guess would be that a poor connection under the dash somewhere
downstream of the ignition switch is causing a voltage drop when the
brake lights come on.  You might measure the voltage between the + 
terminal (black wire) at the gas gauge and body ground, to see what
it does when you step on the brakes.  If it drops quite a bit when
you step on the brakes, then you probably have a bad connection
someplace.  I'd look for a bad connection at the second-from-the-right
fuse in the fuse block first and then chase it further if required.

&gt;Also when I was down talking to Averries he said that it doesn't matter
&gt;if I use a 12 volt or a 6 volt gauge, that they work on resistance and
&gt;not voltage, that if you use a 6v in a 12 volt system the only thing
&gt;that needs to be replaced is the bulb.

There is a little bit about this at 
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/wire6v12.htm but it's not
conclusive.

I hope this helps!
