Subject: Re: [VB] Type IV engine rebuild

you might want to post bay stuff to the type2 list,

I went through this issue some years ago when that same engine (in a 73 
westy) wore out for me, and I ended up with a splittie as it was cheaper than 
a type IV rebuild.  Eventually the type IV engine did get put together with 
the heads rebuildt and new ps/cs.   I took the heads to a local shop, they 
did stuff to them, I picked them up a few days or week later and gave them 
money.   Why not call NW connecting rod in south Seattle?   
PS  Replace rod bearings

&lt;&lt; My son's 1977 Type 2, fuel-injected, 2.L bus is in need of some work on 
the #1
 exhaust valve.  (It's toast).  I have access to all the tools, books, and
 video's one would need inorder to rebuild the heads along with the pistons 
and
 cylinders, however I have never done this before.  I can do all the &quot;usual&quot;
 things required of the vintage bus owner (by that I'm referring to pre-67 
Type
 I engine models).  My question is this:  I am debating whether to order
 complete rebuilt heads from &quot;B*S DEP*T&quot;, or take the valves to a machine shop
 for the all the work and then reassemble the heads myself...any input???Steve
