They went the way of the $50 beetle!!

Seriously, your hardpressed to find a vintage VW of any kind for under 
$1000 being advertised. If you want something cheap, you gotta go find it 
before someone else. They ARE out there...but are pretty darn hard to find. 
I work real hard searching for them and have everyone I know keep an eye 
out for me. Many times will travel 3-4 hours to pick up a junker. And 
believe me, they are in the most surprising places. You basically just have 
to always have your eyes peeled...and be willing to drive out of the way 
every now and then to take a look around. Look in back yards and garages 
and behind houses ect. Main thing is you have to be diligent and extremely 
patient. Finding one is always fun and worth it...even if you never buy it. 
It's like a game for me. Very thrilling.

If anyone wants some $500 busses, come visit me here in San Angelo. I've 
got a '67 right now I'd sell as well as a real nice original condition '72 
Westy. Both need engines. Pictures of both are on my site...links are on 
the main page somewhere.
