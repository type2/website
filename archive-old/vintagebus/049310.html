I haven't had much luck finding metric fasteners at Home Depot or Lowe's.
They have some basic stuff like hex head bolts but they are relatively
expensive. Each time I tackle a project on the Thing, I try to replace the
fasteners with stainless. I've had much more luck ordering on-line. My
local automotive fastener store sells a small gauge for $5 so you can
determine the right size. A good parts manual also helps but I've found
mine is not always accurate on fastener sizes. When ordering on-line it's
good to stock up on some of the more common sizes. I ordered a box of the
8mm hex heads in lengths of 16 and 20mm. You'll find these all over the
car. 4mm screws in various lengths are also common.
Try these sites.

Of course you can always check with the major vw part suppliers as well.
