 Thanks for the moral support, it's important too.
 I am going to stop on the way home this afternoon and get one of those 8mm
 square sockets.
 BTW: since the last post I managed to twist off the head of the screw
 holding the front and rear shift rods together, guess I'll be drilling that
 out while I'm under there.
 
 I really don't want to have to pull the motor and trans out to do this.

the rear coupler screws tend to be relatively easy to undo do to the front 
nose cone seal oozing, and various helpful grease sources keeping the rust 
away.  

However, at the front shift coupler, the lack of closeby grease sources 
creates a completely different microecology, in which it tends to be 
neccessary to add liberally of penetrating oils before even trying to un do 
the screws.  Heat and cold shock treatment helps, as does light tapping.  
Sometimes none of the above work, or it has been broken off previously, and 
it must be drilled.  even then, the rust may have fused the shift linakge 
coupler.   Hope it itsn't that bad for you.  did undoing the two 13mm screws 
under the floor mat that hold the stick shift in the cab give anymore 
freeplay  for the rear coupler?  I know I did this with motor in vehicle.  It 
can be done.  Any 66/67 people out there have more recent experience with 
this?
