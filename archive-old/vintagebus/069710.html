Subject: RE: [VB] porsche pulley in

&gt; Second that, I've had three different sizes turn up so far, subtle
&gt; differences.

From parts books...

113 105 251 Crankshaft pulley 25hp
111 105 251A to engine 3399999 30hp
113 105 251A from 3400000 30 34 42 44hp
111 105 253B oversize 50.5mm to 3399999 25 30hp
113 105 253  oversize 50.5 from 2400000 30 34 42 44hp

and from the loaf parts book

111 105 251F 44hp
113 105 251G 47 44hp M240 and frp, AD000001 46 50hp  M240
111 105 251E 44hp
111 105 253A oversoze 50.5 44hp
113 105 253B oversize 50.5 47 50 , 44 46 : M240


Wow thats a lot.
but the only sizes listed are for the 50.5mm  oversize diameter.
Can anybody make sense of that?

Im going out to measure all of the pulleys I have.

OK found 6. 5 were almost exactly 7&quot; dia the last was smaller like 6 5/8&quot;
dia.


Someone with a stash measure a bunch of pulleys and send me the sizes.
