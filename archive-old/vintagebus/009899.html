&gt;2. A VW Bus is featured in the video.
&gt;
&gt;I know no examples... yet.  But these would be very
&gt;interesting to know.


You know...I don't usually listen to country music...but for some odd reason
I remember catching a newer country music video.._dot_can't remember the
title...maybe some kinda up beat dancin' but love song....featured and early
double cab....real pretty lookin'...red &amp; white two tone....with two hippie
type folks in front of it....maybe somebody else knows the song I'm talking
about.
