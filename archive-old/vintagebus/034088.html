I have taken 1 of my buses down to the local auto glass shop and for ten
dollars they sealed both my winshields with hot gun sealant, this is the
same stuff used to hold the windshields in new cars, 3 years of desert heat,
a little rain, (when it does rain it pours) over 150 days with no rain now.
They have special tips to get into the seam and run a hot bead in the seam,
when this dries it bonds the rubber to the metal. The only way to remove
glass/seal then is with a hot knife or a ton of razors.Cheap,it works and
you don't have to deal with the mess!!

&lt;&lt; I am thinking (?) I need to get some sealant inside lip and a bead around

with prior experience help me out with a product and/or advice before I

Hi Don,
Roofing tar is the only material we have used that has not let us down
inside 
of 18 months like all of the other sealants we tried.   Eric&amp;Barb
