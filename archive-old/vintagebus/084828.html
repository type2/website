&gt; Discovered today what happened..... but that doesn't entirely discount the
&gt; overly fluffy person falling backwards under extreme acceleration theory
&gt; either.....

It was a joke, I say, a joke!  If a stout guy was leaning back against
an empty beer can, you might be able to crush the can with the
gut-wrenching acceleration of a stock Bus, but a rim would be pretty
hard to bend.

*whips out the HP48SX*

I can't find Bus numbers, but they're slower than a Bug, right?  The
1969 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; says a 1500 Beetle has a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to
62 mph) time of 22 seconds.  100 km/h is 27.8 m/s.  (27.8-0)/22 is
1.26 m/(s^2).  g is about 9.8 m/(s^2), so this is an acceleration of
0.129 g.  You can probably create a greater acceleration than this by
simply sitting down hard in the seat of the Bus...
