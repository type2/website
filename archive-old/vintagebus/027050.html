&gt; &gt;  All this talk about putting originals in your bus. I have 1 question for
&gt; &gt; you all. How did you insert the original screw plate to mount the Safaris in
&gt; &gt; your buses???? I would bet that 95% of you don't even know about this
&gt; &gt; moveable plate that mounts the windows, you  just drill and screw, right!
&gt; &gt; Look at a real stock Safari windshield bus with the windshields removed and
&gt; &gt; see what I mean. If you want it original, due it CORRECT or don't do it, who
&gt; &gt; cares about correct latches when you don't even have the CORRECT mounting
&gt; &gt; plates? Flame me? go ahead.
