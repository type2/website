The wife and I went to see &quot;Blow&quot; this weekend and noticed a VW bus in the
film...  The problem was that the year was pre 1970, assumed to be 1969, and
the bus shown was a mid 70's model!

Those guys in Hollywood need to pay attention to details!

The movie was pretty good though and definitely sent an anti-drug message.
Since there isn't any hardcore action scenes I would go with renting over
viewing in the theatre. Good movie overall.  I want to definitely get the
soundtrack if the songs are anywhere close to what was in the movie!
