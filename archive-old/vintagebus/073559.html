Subject: RE: [VB] Friday Rant .............. only my first for today.

&gt;As the current seller of two VW vehicles.
&gt;http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/66westy.htm
&gt;http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/83westy.htm
&gt;I'm getting a little ticked off when people start demanding that I lower
my price without ever have driven or had first hand view of my vehicles.
&gt;
Just say No.  No works very well.

When I was selling my last VW, several people emailed messages like this:
&quot;$3000, I will pick it up.&quot;

That's it - no name, no questions about the vehicle.

To the first message I responded:
&quot;I would never sell anyone a car without talking to them on the phone and
making sure they know what they are getting.&quot;  The guy actually apologized
and ended up buying the car for the full asking price about 3 months later.
 He still never really asked any questions but at least I tried.  After
he agreed to buy the car and was making preparations to have it shipped,
he also said &quot;Shipping is going to be about $700.  You are going to split
that with me, right?&quot;   After I stopped laughing, I said &quot;No.&quot;

To the other messages I simply replied:
&quot;No.&quot;

Or say &quot;Come see it with cash in your pocket and we will talk&quot;.
