Subject: what to power my splitty with.

I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty with. I
haven't bought it yet, but the one I am getting has no engine and is a 62, I
think. I Thought may be one of those fancy bored and stroked crate motors
you see in the VW magazines with the fancy Porsche fan. I am curious about
other options too.  I do have a little 2.8 liter GM v6in my back yard. I
have seen a bay window with a Toyota in it and I have seen a pic of a Subaru
engine in one. Any advice?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
