Subject: re:oil cooler seals

just an update on my oil cooler seals replacement...i finally did it today. It
appeared that my oil cooler had two studs coming out of it, and one hole for a
stud from the engine case to go through.

One of the nuts holding the oil cooler on was missing, and the other two were
incredibly loose...hence the leaking oil. The seals looked ok-a bit smooshed.

I replaced them, and put a new nut on, so that all three connections were
tightened securely. 

Then i put the whole thing back together...doesn't seem to leak now.(at least
from where it was leaking before).

Does anyone actually have a bus that does not leak a little oil? It must be
possible...
