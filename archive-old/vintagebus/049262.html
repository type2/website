Finally after 1 year and 9 months of searching, I found the correct 2 burner Enders stove for my '59 Westy.  Talk about a needle in a haystack.  If any other Westy owners need info on it or pics, please pmail me.  There are also a few pics of Todd Swangstu's stove on Everett's page under the Type 2 accessories section.

Now I just need the electric water tank pump if anyone has one lying around.

Robert
