 a long way home....

This afternoon i went to get my 60  200km away from here, with my westfalia
73 and a tow Dolly!!

First i want to thanks everybody from the list, all those advice help me in
my way back remembering experiences from others folks...

Im now safe and the split is well in the garage now!!  Picture will come
soon...
Its not easy to tow a similar vehicle behind, my hitch was strong enough but
once i was there one bolt was stripped, much because of the vibration of the
tow dolly because it has no suspension so when the road is bad it jump on
the road..he he... but i replace the Bolt, put the split on the dolly, and
now it was in the hand of god...or whoever  :))  I had to cross on the
highway 2 capital city, Quebec city was on my way and i was cruisin 40-45
mph and the other car much more so this was a stress when crossin major
cities... otherwise all went fine at this speed, lot of new pavement on the
road so this help having a smooth tow!!  It was a UHAUL tow dolly and i have
t say this a grat TOW dolly, a bit heavy but really easy to work with !!

One funny thing, on my way to the split i stopped at a gaz station, and
there was a 67 camper acting as an halloween decoration...the owner went at
me and told me he wanted the 60 but too lat it was mine hahaha, his 67 was
really rotten but many piece uinterested me as the front seat and the camper
windows...  but the owner dont want to sell anything... it will rot here
many other years i thing.  I put Fuel and left...

Now im relaxing from the stress and drinkin wine ...next post ill send the
VIN for general interest!!  I can began a full resto!!

yx again fellow listee!!
