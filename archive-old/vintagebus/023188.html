Subject: Question for the Panel Camper owners
Mime-Version: 1.0

I was out in my Riviera today tweaking about with some of the wood.
There've been some road squeaks and noises that I know are coming from the
interior somewhere.  Well, I removed a panel on the driver's side...the one
that covers the upper vents in back...and I found a lot of old inch-thick
foam that had degraded over the years.  Once, I could tell, the foam had
covered even the vents.  

So I tore out all the old foam just in an effort to clean things up and
started wondering how to weatherproof this area.  Surely some rain must get
into those.  Or should I make some cuts into the wood and get some extra
airflow going in the rear of the Bus?

What do the rest of you folk out there have set up in your panel campers?
