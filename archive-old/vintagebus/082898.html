Subject: Strange electrical problem

Hi,

My 64DD has a new wire harness. Via the ignition switch, the engine will not
shut off if the headlights are on and the brake pedal is depressed. As soon
as I lift my foot off the pedal the engine will stop. Any suggestions as to
where to look for the problem?

Thanks,
Chris.

PS. I did not install the harness myself. Was done by the guys that did the
restoration.
