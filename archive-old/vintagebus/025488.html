Hello Volks,

My supervisor at Vintage Auto, Steve Munsey, gave me a set of 2 Hazet
wrenches he thought would fit the front axle nuts on my bus. They are
very slim (so you can turn both nuts against each other), one is angled
and the other is straight. They are 32mm, which is too big for my axle
nuts. Does anyone know what they are for? They look brand new, and maybe
I could trade them for something I can use...
