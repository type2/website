Pete,

It sounds like you did not have the engine rotated properly, i.e., you though you were at TDC #1 and
you weren't, likewise on #4.

Take those shims out, take the rotor cap off and redo the process making sure the rotor is pointing
to the correct spark plug wire for the cylinder where you are setting the valves.

&gt; I was adjusting my valves yesterday and this is what
&gt; happened: When I set at TDC #1, I adjusted intake and
&gt; exhaust for #1. I then rotated to TDC #4, I found I
&gt; couldn't adjust because even with the adjusters backed
&gt; all the way off, I still couldn't get the feeler gauge
&gt; in. Bottom line, I could adjust #3 and #1 but could
&gt; not get feeler in on #2 and #4. I bought some shims to
&gt; put behind the rocker assembly and adjusted all the
&gt; valves. When I started the motor it ran awful. It
&gt; sputtered and popped and backfired something awful.
&gt; What do you guys think happened??
