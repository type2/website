Subject: my first trip

I bought a 65 bus about a month ago to make cross country trips in. I have
quite a bit of air cooled volkswagen experience, but this is my first
vintage vw. We are looking to make a trip from texas to west virgina in june
and I was looking for any advice on setting up the bus for the journey. It
is a bone stock 6 volt bus with no interior(except for the rebuilt 1600
motor added). I have also just added a back seat out of a campmobile. Also
the accelerator pedal hinge has broken in half and I was looking for another
option than welding a fence hinge under it. Thank you
