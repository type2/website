I know this isn't Friday, but my 10 year old daughter just spotted a
really nice bus in a Post Honey Comb cereal ad during the Saturday
morning cartoons. She called me in to see it and I caught about half the
ad. The bus gets some pretty good shots in the ad. It's a post '61 (has
the flat front turn signals), it's light green on the botton and white
on the top, has a full width middle seat with the fold down end, has a
roof rack, and appears to be a Standard Microbus. The camera moves fast
so its hard to get a really good look at anything.

I just wanted to alert you kids on the west coast. You still have a
couple of hours of cartoons ahead of you so be watching for this ad 8^).
