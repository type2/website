Subject: RE: 65 panel progress

(Still have some bodywork to do, but my goal was to get it &quot;presentable&quot;,
and go from there. I am going to try the new adhesive and rivet method on
the body panels. The pros say it's much better than welding.

Jon&quot;)

Pro's in accident repairs or bodyshops maybe?  They are a lot different than
restoration shops. Not pro's in restoration. Thats been debated a lot and
I'll stick to welding thanks. I don't know of any professional restorers of
VW's or anything that use that method. Ask Charlie Hamill, or Lenny Copp how
they do it. I think they are 2 of the most respected in VW's resto's. Of
course thats my opinion you can do as you please.
