&lt;&lt; Please don't let's get into another round of Dawn-bashing. She had some
 troubles, she's doing her best to deal with it and keep her business
 afloat, she's finally getting it back together -- give her a break! &gt;&gt;

    Au contraire, as one who needs canvas, I wanna know if I spend my money 
can I expect product in return. I've seen her product and think its of good 
quality, 'But', if your business runs into problems for whatever reason, it 
is inherent on you to tell the people who's money you've taken, 'sorry' it 
will be another X months or more. To continue to take money when you can't 
deliver product is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.
