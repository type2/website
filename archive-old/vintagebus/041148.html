Hello buslist!
I spent too much time today carefully bending and rebending a piece of
aluminum flatstock to make a horizontal thermo flaps linkage for my
1600dp. I think I got it right! Basically I copied the 1500 version,
but offset the centre by  1 1/2&quot; to clear the doghouse oilcooler and
wider fan housing. The offset makes it less rigid than the original,
but what else can I do? The vertical rod seems the same 1500/1600. If
someone could describe the proper VW horizontal flaps linkage I would
appreciate it. I am low on energy right now, so I probably won't get
around to putting the engine back in until monday afternoon. Still
time for modifications before I button this thing back up. I can't
figure out how to test the whole combination without putting it back
in the bus and starting it up, so my fingers are crossed tight with my
eye on the heavens. The whole system seems pretty hokey, but I could
see how it might work. After all it was brought to us by the same
people who came up with that pressurize the washer fluid with the
spare tire thing. That sort of works at least briefly, why not the
thermo flaps?
Next step is to figure out a return spring...

Choke rattle gasp rattle cough rattle roar!
