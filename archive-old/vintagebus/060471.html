Subject: Re: [VB] New WCM &quot;Felts&quot;???

Was on holidays so this is a late comment on this topic....

Basically, the originals are rubber with cloth glued on them. So what I did
was strip the old cloth off and washed the rubber moulding with warm soap
and water. Then found some black nylon high density fabric at the fabric
store. Cut fabric to fit the rubber with overlap and glued with 3M weather
strip adhesive. The window is used to &quot;mold&quot; the fabric into the
rubber/adhesive, let dry and trim. Re-install and away you go again.

My own rebuild has lasted  5 years and still going strong...

Very cost effective to... at under $15 Cdn......

&gt;
&gt; i just ordered some WCM &quot;felt channels&quot; for the front door
&gt; windows, and they are drastically different than the ones i've got in the
&gt; past.
