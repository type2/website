He cut a $150 deal for a '62 Westy Kamper with original safaries,
tent and roofrack that was at the back of this hothouse.  Apparently this
hothouse was meant to dry out grapes or something or another and it left the
westy in perfect shape.  No rust, all in excellent shape.  Now thats what I
call a garage!   The other two splits were also supposed be in equal shape.
He didnt go after them at that time as he was so excited (and hot).  He called
back a couple of days later after things slowed down for him and they were
sold to another guy  :(   for $100 each.


-----------------------

Oh! you're breaking my heart!!!!! This proves the point once again to
*always* get the deal in writing and either pay for the ($150) deal or leave
an agreed financial deposit. Close the deal ASAP and yank it home in the
same mode! Too many times we've all heard of a verbal deal wherein someone's
word and a handshake vaporized in the presence of Benjamin Franklin and a
lowboy trailer.

VanBondo's motto:
&quot;Do business before doing business and get the business done!&quot;

In otherwords, &quot;Get it in writing, pay for it, and get it outta there.&quot;

Great story though, cant wait to hear where the Westy ends up (Japan/Pomona
for &quot;bank&quot;) and how soon.
