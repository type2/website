&gt;Hi Volks, can anyone recommend a good Bus/Bug shop in the Dallas, TX area?

When I lived in Dallas about eight years ago, I got VW parts at Knight's
in Garland? and at Black Gold in Arlington.  I think Knight's just did
parts, but Black Gold may have done service as well.  I can't find a
current listing or site for Knight's; the Dallas Southwestern Bell yellow
pages has Black Gold at 2247 E Division, Arlington 76011, (817) 633-1135
or (817) 640-4653.  The people at Black Gold were really helpful; they
can probably refer you to a good local VW shop if they don't do service
themselves.
