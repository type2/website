Way unlikely, but can he use any of the *pile* of 68-&gt; leaves that I have
been accumulating??????  I am on my 3rd breadloaf beam replacement, and I
been saving the leaves (why?  why does anyone save VW bits? :)  I now have
a pile and no idea how to use them.  If they will fit the earlier beam, I
got 'em.... free!
