I'm sure your political beliefs are totally right and everyone else is
wrong... 

but good god keep it off the list, i hate politics and i love busses, if i
wanted to read about politics i'd join a politics list.

Bus content:
I Think my heat risers are plugged on my Single Port intake manifold.

This being my first SP, i thought i'd ask... can you remove the intake
manifold without pulling the engine? (not a big deal either way, i'd just
like to budget my time appropriately and not bother trying to remove it
in-situ if it is impossible)

take care,

Steve
