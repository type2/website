i disagree.  I like my compufire module, my cassette deck, full flow oil
filtration, radial tires, CDI, etc.

&gt; That is after all why we like the &quot;vintage&quot; automobiles.  If it is new or
&gt; not original....  Go buy a new beetle or some other anonymous vehicle!!!

I like a bus because it is simple and easy to work on and has carachter.
If i like the way something is, ill keep it that way, if i want to change
it i'll change it.  Generally i dont hack metal or weld on turrets, but i
might just enjoy such a beast if i found it that way already.  (i have a
67 with a busted frame and have had visions of welding the front end from
another bus onto it to make a 6?/67 frankenstein...)

My way of enjoying old cars is no less valid than yours, please dont dis
me because i like dual relief 1600's with electronic ignition in a bus
thats supposed to have a bastard 40.  Or maybe 67 tranny, beam and brakes
in a 61... (think my ideal bus is a 61 with 67 beam and tranny,
camperized, 1600 dp, but stock looking from the outside...down to the 15
inch rims, but i am constantly changing my mind on that...)

To me, being forced to maintain some arbitrary standard of vintage
correctness is no less anonymous than ponying up $x for a new econobox.
Do what you want to do, not what others tell you to.  If what you want is
to make your bus bone stock thats cool... if you want a little spice in
your soup, have fun too.

peas,

Steve

p.s. ill trade you 2 rebuildable H cases and a 36 horse for 2 new
brazillian cases... thats a good deal.... vintage correctness for you,
modern brazillian perversion for me.
