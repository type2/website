Hey list,
 Finally got my trucks ONLY site up to releasable status (at least i think
so). Contains pretty much everything for a truck fan. Year to year with
pics, restoration help, truck m-codes, truck toys, truck literature,
accessories,etc. Even got some old commercials in wav format. Go check it
out and lemme know what you guys think, or if you see probs. I tried to make
it a point not to have pics that other sites have, so most everything you
see will be new. More to follow as time allows.
Thanks to the people who &quot;beta tested&quot; my site, including some main listees,
much appreciated
Link it on your sites if you like it
