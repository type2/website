I hate to disagree with a god, but if you heat a pushrod it will get
longer.  If you put a stress on it it will get shorter, and the two do not cancel
out.  A hot pushrod under stress will be longer than a cold pushrod under
the same stress.

If you take an engine designed for a .006 gap with aluminum pushrods and
replace them with steel, you will end up with more gap at operating
temperature.  You canna' change the laws of physics!
