Subject: Re: [VB] Any PNWers going to Sacramento this weekend

Interesting...Eric&amp;Barb referring to themselves in 3rd
person.  It's almost like another person, some kind of
&quot;union&quot; between the two is now responding to queries
from the list...or a hired hand doing the responses
for them.  Eric&amp;Barb = &quot;The Rock&quot;?

Paul (I know it's not Friday, but I just thought it
was funny now)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi David,
&gt; Eric and his sister will be going!  Barb has to stay
&gt; home to care for her 
&gt; dad.  If you are going to Octobugfest in Puyallup we
&gt; could arrange to meet 
&gt; you there with the seat.   Eric&amp;Barb
