	...Bradley
&gt; 66 micro wrote
&gt;
&gt; Then, after working for THE MAN and getting nowhere,
&gt; I quit.

Like Boo Radley (Were you written by Harper or Truman, Boo?) I write ad copy
and own a 66 micro. I'm still working for the man, though. Bradley sounds
like he was inspired by fine literature, I was inspired by &quot;Lemon,&quot; &quot;Think
Small&quot; and all those great VW ads.
