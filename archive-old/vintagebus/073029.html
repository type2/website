Subject: re:airs help

Actually this is a different dan and keith-they claim they have never been
through Kansas...their plate is from Arizona, they are originally from New
Orleans, and bought their bus in San Diego, and registered it in
Arizona...so the story goes...they are getting it ready for a pull in the
morning...

****************
Was writ:
Tell Dan and Keith &quot;hi&quot; from Richard in Denver, CO!  They were having CV
joint problems when they passed through here, and I got them a new joint and

axle to help get them on their way.  They started having clutch problems
around Kansas, and it seemed to me that they were going to need a new clutch

and t/o bearing soon.
