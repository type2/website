Subject: RE: [VB] 1500 Tin on 40 HP???

  The cylinder tin is different on a 1500 then a 40hp. The 1500 cylinder tin
is longer and you would have to cut 1/4 inch give or take a few mm from the
part towards the case. You will also have to modify the intake holes, even
though they are larger on the 1500 but configured a little different. The
muffler will not fit unless you do a little bending and reconfiguration on
the pipes, The 1500 flywheel should be an O-ring style and will not fit on
the 40 hp crank unless you knock out the outer ring which is the top of the
groove for the o-ring (you can do that on 1500 crank flywheels). If you
drove with the 1500, be prepared for going even slower with the 40hp.

Subject: [VB] 1500 Tin on 40 HP???


I got a 40 hp engine to put in the '64, however, I am having trouble getting
the cooling tin to fit.  Is it possible?? Also, can I use the flywheel and
exhaust from the 1500 on the 40 hp? TIA
