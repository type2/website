&lt;&lt; Don't all air-conditioned type1-engined powered VW's have the same issue?

Hi Stephen,
Well that is a good question.  The air conditioner pulley set up has a smaller
lower pulley dia. for the air conditioner only.  Too run a second generator
with this smaller pulley attached to the normal stock pulley would mean that
the second generator would charge only at higher RPMs.  Thus the puzzle of
trying to find a good picture of the lower pulley in a double generator set up
to see if the lower pulley for the second generator is the same size as the
stock pulley or smaller. 
Thanks, Eric &amp; Barb
