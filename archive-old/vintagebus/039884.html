hey,
i got a call on sunday morning from a Richard from South Africa who is 
touring the states with his wife. he is coming from chicago via I-90 and 
just needs a place to park the bus for a night. seemed like an interesting 
person, im anxious to meet him. i was wondering if anyone has met him yet.
