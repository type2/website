Subject: Headlight Trouble Fixed
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I started my story last nite...figure I should go ahead and finish it
up.

With the hi-beam floor switch now putting out correctly, we ohm tested the
wire between the switch and the fuse box.  Aha...no power getting to the
fuse box.  Replaced the wire and I now have lo-beams!  My previous theory
that it was the power wire that got fried to the switch was wrong, I think.
 I think that the power wire got a little melted and that it was the
lo-beam wire that got cooked inside the harness.  &lt;shrug&gt; The world may
never care.  With the headlights fixed, I now had one parking light working
too!  Bonus...the other one simply required its own ground wire, after much
cleaning of surfaces didn't yield light.

With all that fixed, I treated myself to finally getting a spare tire and
some camping gear.  &lt;grin&gt;
