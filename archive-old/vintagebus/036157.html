Just grabbed a '61 bus with way too many windows and a gaping hole in the

Should middle seat have Aluminum or plastic grab handles on top?

congrats on the bus- BTW what colour is it?

the 61 middle seat is a one year one in that the bar on top is round metal
covered with a corregated white plastic thngy.  Is that what you have..   It
is diferent than the 62-67 middle seat grab bar, as tthat cross sectioned is
like the 62-67 dash grab handle cross section.  I think there is a connection.
Shoot, now everyone is going to take this info I wrote, steal it and make big
buckeroos.  If I say it's copyright does that stop you, or do I need to file a
copyright somewhere?
