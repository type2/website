Subject: LSTA

Was anyone on this list in the Lone Star Transporter Association? It 
was a Texas bus club. It's dead now...and has been for a while. 
Reason I ask is because I'd kinda like to resurect the name and start 
something new. If anyone was in it, or has contact info for whoever 
ran it, email me.
