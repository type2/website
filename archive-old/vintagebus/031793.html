I used to have side steps on both sides of my DD (will install again for
BBB V) and found I never used them, it was easier to open the cargo doors
and stand in the opening, but it looked cool haveing steps on both sides. I
never bolted them in or springed them or anything, just tapped them in the
openings and off I went, guess I was lucky they never fell off.

ps. I have had my $14.99 floor jack for years and it has never let me down.

You know, I got to thinking about that, and finally decided to buy a cheap 
floor jack ($15 on sale at Checker or somewhere).  I sure hope it works if I

need it.  (I don't usually buy cheap tools 'cause you get what you pay for).
