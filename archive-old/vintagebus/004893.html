All,
I am with Daniel on this one, I have a 66 that I bought a week ago and I
have used all my excitement to try to find this damn plate. It is not there
in any of the oft quoted places.  Behind the drivers seat there is a plate
with the body # and some weights, but no M-Code plate and no scars where its
been. is this a common Australian experience?

&gt;Thanks.  Daniel
&gt;-  - - -
&gt;so- on the forward side of the bulkhead where the front seats rest.  look
for
&gt;a 2&quot;x3&quot; plate held in by 2 little screws.   there is either a plate, the
place
&gt;the plate was but has been removed from, or the body number stamped in
(this
&gt;last on most 50s buses).  You can only see it if the seat is out of the
way.
