Subject: Re: [VB] Metal Fuel Line Safety

I have used the larger diameter metal brake line a replacement fuel line
from the tank into the motor compartment . You can buy it in almost any
length and it bends well into areas you need it to. I have had it on my bus
for about a year and have no problems. I also don't like using a long rubber
hose as they seem to weather badly when exposed to all the elements in the
tranny area.
