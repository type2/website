Hi,
You also need to get a reamer with a centering attachment.  Otherwise you will
invaribly will ream the bottom center bushing a little off center from the top
bushing.  Then you will have to take off more material off one side of the
upper bushing.  Which could possibly be so off center that you ream the upper
bushing out of round by not reaming part of one side of the upper bushing.
Making the new replacement upper bushing wear out prematurely, not to mention
the possiblity of ovaling the bottom bushing in doing all of this.   Eric &amp;
