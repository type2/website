I dont care what anybody says, the first time I see black widows in my bus
I won't just bug bomb it I might just bomb the whole damn thing and start
over. :)

&gt;talkings of hitchhiking unwanted critters, I also had a mouse living in my 
&gt;bug.  I dont know for how long, but when I had to buy a new battery, I found 
&gt;it live under the back seat.  It ran along the wir eto the starter, and
poked 
&gt;it's head back through the hole to laugh at me.   I didn't bother to chase
it 
&gt;off, as I figured it would just run back  where I couldn't get it, and I am 
&gt;sure it was hiding warm and toasty and would resist eviction.   Grommet?
hm, 
&gt;now the real purpose of the grommet  it realeved-  to keep the mice
out!!!!!  
&gt;  Anyway, it proceeded to eat a hole in my formerly pristine glovebox
(anyone 
&gt;who has seen this car will now roll around in a fit of laughter hearing that 
&gt;anything on it is pristine) and now occasionally small things roll out of
the 
&gt;glovebox into the area under the hood.  Like all those 6V bulbs I pulled out 
&gt;of junkyard buses.   Then they roll down the compartment there and fall out 
&gt;the drip holes at the bottom front where the spare tire supposedly fits, or 
&gt;did until someone pushed things around with the bug.        But tossing bug 
&gt;bombs in my bus is just not my bag, man, would give me  a headache for two 
&gt;weeks, canary that I am.     And killing spiders is bad luck.    ZHm, does 
&gt;this have bus content?
