&lt;&lt; Here's the listing.  Truth in advertising.

There was a lot of vacillating as to if it was NOS or not in the ad but it 
did say (Quoted directly from the listing)  

&quot;There appears to have been no use of the case ever.&quot;  

Doesn't sound like that is what was received.  While there may be subtle 
differences between NOS and almost NOS, there is a big difference between 
either of those and well worn.  Let the independent third party decide.  If 
it has indeed been used to the point of being well worn, then it definitely 
isn't as described and a refund is definitely in order.
