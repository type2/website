Subject: Re: First Long Road Trip...Advice?
Message-Id: &lt;l03130302b370a0391db8_at_[128.0.0.164]&gt;

&gt;On friday I'm leaving from Springfield, MA to drive my precious 71 Westy to
&gt;Colorado Springs, CO.  This is my first trip over a couple hours that I'm
&gt;taking my baby on, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me.  Any
&gt;tools/parts that may be essential to have, and also any veteran knowledge
&gt;that may help me out on my way.  I'd love to hear some responses!


I've made a lot of long trips in all sorts of vehicles and have helped a
number of people who didn't have as much luck keeping their vehicle
together.

There is no secret to keeping things together, but most people are either
too lazy, or procrastinate.  There are even those people who wait to fix
something until it brakes!!  I for one would rather spend my trips seeing
the sites and not stressing over what is going to go next.

I much prefer to fix things before they brake.  Before any long trip, I
like to:
- change all fluids (engine, tranny and gear boxes)
- grease front wheel bearings (also rear and CV's on bay window busses)
- inspect all brake parts for leaks and cracks
- major tune up on engine
- front wheel alignment (they will also let you know if any parts including
tires are worn past limits)

If you know things are close to the end of their life (brake lines and
wheel cylinders, clutch, axle or CV boots, fuel pump, etc.) replace them
now.

I also take along a few extra items:
-basic tools (screw drivers, combination wrenches, sockets, hammer, pliers,
&quot;bailing&quot; wire, duct tape, wire ties, hand cleaner, a role of shop towels,
electrical wire and electrical tape)
- small piece of cardboard to lay on (poor boy's creeper)
- clutch and throttle cables
- engine oil
- flashlight
- wheel chocks
- 4 way lug wrech
- generator belt
- fuel pump

If you take the time to prepare, your trip will be a lot more enjoyable.
Like they say, fix it now, or fix it later.

Have fun on your trip.  Remember, Life is Short, so Enjoy the Journey!!
