Subject: plug problem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Earlier I wrote in complaining about the 71 Dual port engine in my 66 micro 
having two different size plugs in it.  I thought that the guy who had it 
before me had retapped one of the plug holes to fit a larger size plug rather 
than heli-coiling it.  Turns out he did heli-coil it.  The heli-coil just 
came out with the plug thus making the plug appear to be a bigger thread.  
Jeez I feel dumb! (or at least inexperienced)  
I now have to re-heli-coil the hole and hope my cylinder isn't completely 
burned.  The guy at the shop didn't seem too confident.  Wish me luck cause I 
would really like to drive my bus.  

On a side note are there any St Augustine subscribers who can tell me when 
the next Pope Road VW meet will be?  I can't remember if it's the third 
Saturday or the last Saturday of each month and all the fliers have 
mysteriously disappeared.  I have missed the last few meets due to work and 
hope you guys haven't quit on me.  Calling Bruce Kahler are you still out 
there?
