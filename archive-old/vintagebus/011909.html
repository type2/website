&gt; Barb, Eric, George, and the List,
&gt; 	I think that I'm leaning toward an electric-fan-driven recirculating
&gt; system... with two of the bilge blowers on the &quot;cold&quot; side of the
heater
&gt; boxes (for my paranoia about heat damaging the fans, which Barb &amp; Eric
&gt; brought up)... and intake air for the fans ducted from beneath the
rear
&gt; seats or from under the spare tire, whatever seems best at the time. 
&gt; 	I am curious, though, as to why you say it is necessary to have some
&gt; positive air pressure to the heater boxes all the time... since it is
&gt; for the most part completely sealed off when the heater is not
&gt; operational (heater flaps closed), which would seem to negate the idea
&gt; of air actually flowing through there.

The heater flaps don't seal the outlet of the boxes completely.  They
allow a bypass flow that keeps the heat exchangers cool.

If you turn the fan off completely, hot air will rise (via a chimney
effect) through the electric fans and into the passenger compartment. 
This air would be _very_ hot and would probably toast the fans.

My preferred method around this is to build a flapper box that will
seal the fans from the exchangers when they are off, and to pass flow
from the engine fan through the exchangers to provide cooling.  This
way, the electric fans won't have to be on all the time.  This is a
variation of the system from a late-model baywindow, with
recirculation added.
