Ah, well, the brakes don't work.  I was going to do the brakes after I fixed
the electrical :-P  I knew that the brake lights went thru the box, but didn't
think they would affect hazards.  I'll try shorting the terminals on the brake
switches for the tests (that'll work won't it?).  Unfortunately I won't have
another shot at the bus until at least Tuesday.

Signal switch works the blinkers and clicks the headlight relay, but I will
check it before deciding the box is funky.  

Thanks for the input.  And that is a darn good writeup you did, I might add!
