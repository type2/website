Subject:  RE: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?


So what's with the 'closed' skylight sections visible
on the interior shots?  Is this how they did sunroof
standard barns from factory?

????????????

RobK

p.s. looks very crusty in the roof, where the
roof clips onto the body.  This is very very very
difficult to repair if the rust has moved through
the u section in which the roof sits....

&gt;Is the sunroof Barndoor Kombi that's for sale on TheSamba as special as
the guy thinks? I over heard him talking about it at a show this past
weekend.
He seems to think it's gold. Considering all it's missing is $4000 anything
but outrageous? or are pre 55  type 2's that much more valuable that post
55?
&gt;
It's gold.  I'd like to own it but $4000 is too much for me, IMHO, based
on all the welding and repair work and expen$ive missing parts that it looks
like it needs.  Judging by his description and the photos, it looks MUCH
worse (to me) than the ad leads you to believe.  Of course, I haven't seen
it in person.

It's a Standard, not a Kombi.  If it was a Kombi...  ;)
