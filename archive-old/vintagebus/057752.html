Subject: Re: [VB] carb jetting - new concept for me ??

Sorry no part number for the pulley.  Two things, the first one was a 6 volt
type 3  generator (maybe) and this did not line up with the crank pulley ( we
did run this at least 5k miles ), the second we carried around a stock generator
pulley and bought anything and all that were smaller the shot gun approach.
As we remember Thom modified a porsche gen the work but $$$
P &amp; C

&gt; you state:  &quot;We have now a smaller gen. pulley to give us 2.1 to 1 fan to
&gt; crank ratio. Stock is 1.6 to 1.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I have been struggling w/ fan speed issues in  my '70.  What generator
&gt; pulley did you use?  Any information on how to obtain one would be very
&gt; useful to me.  I have really been struggling to find a combination that will
&gt; get my 1600dp above 1.8:1 (I have a late model crank pulley installed, a
&gt; stock alt/fan pulley, and a stock *alternator* belt (11.3X912)).  W/ this
&gt; set-up, I expected at least a 2.0:1 ratio, but only got 1.8:1.  I'd love to
&gt; be able to install a smaller gen/alt pulley.
