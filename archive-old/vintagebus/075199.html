Subject: Please speak slow so I can understand ..

Please speak slow so I can understand and so that I don't sound like an idiot
when I try to stand up for myself on Monday morning ... So far I got .. it is
not a block it is a &quot;case.&quot;  and according to Dave W. I shouldn't drive it.
Is this because something can happen to the engine ?? Or is it because the
steering is so messed up ??? I have really jumped around regarding what
happened .. and when .. So I will try and put it all in order.

1)  It is not a NEW engine.  It is a rebuilt one.  To me that is new.  I guess
I better watch the way I word stuff.

2)  This is a daily driver, so I will probably need to rent a car on Monday.
I will have them fix what they caused to break.  The case .. I do not know how
the case broke.  The mechanic said it was a common thing .. it seemed
impossible for that to be so, but I don't know enough to debate him .. I will
if you help me.

3)  here is the order in which things started to fall apart.

Took the bus home and noticed that when I pushed on the clutch, it had to go
all the way to the floor to shift gears.

One of the sons got underneath and was adjusting the clutch .. It seemed
better because when I pushed all the way to the floor, the pedal would rub
against the metal opening ... It was when the son was under adjusting the
clutch that he said &quot;there is oil leaking under here.&quot;

I could hear  the throw out bearing making a noise.... I think that was the
first time I heard it .. and when I drove away I heard this clunking coming
from the rear.  In the newsgroup they joked to make sure that &quot;the keg was
standing upright ... &quot; that is was probably rolling around in the back and
that was the clunk.  When the joking ended someone mentioned &quot;motor mount&quot;
Not 100% sure .. but took my concerns to the mechanic ... Got the son to ride
around the block but the clunk wasn't there .. By the time I got home and back
I could hear the clunk almost all the time .. Brought it back .. said &quot;did you
hear that when I pulled up?&quot;  They MUST HAVE .. but all said . &quot;didn't hear
anything .. &quot;  I moved it .. it clunked .. they just shook their heads and I
assumed I was losing my mind.

A few days passed .. still clunk .. still leaking oil .. &quot;vw don't leak oil ..
they just leave their scent ..&quot;  That was the comment .. I insisted that with
my new [rebuilt] engine, I shouldn't see oil .. To humor me I guess they
pulled the engine.  I was at work when they did that.  They were also
replacing the tie rod ends that day.  I came back after work .. he gave me the
bill for the repair, and that day they were also to do the 500 mile oil change
and valve adjust .. After I paid my bill he told me about the crack.  Told me
it was so common .. etc etc .. Couldn't explain why it happened .. just &quot;that
is how they are .. blah blah .. &quot;  You can say anything to someone who is as
ignorant as I about mechanics.

Thing is .. I wasn't buying the &quot;it is common thing ..&quot;  My 71 bus ran like a
champ .. I took her round trip to work every day 70 miles.  NEVER A PROBLEM
and the rebuilt engine was about 10 years old.  PERFECT engine.  The engine on
my bus is a 1640 .. is that right ?? the old bus was a 1600 and the new a 1640
..

So here is what I need to know.  When they pull the engine etc etc .. put it
back together .. How can I be sure I am getting the engine I paid for ??? and
not something they just threw together.  Any other info is greatly appreciated
.. But not to technical, because I want to sound as if I learned this .. and I
want to know what I am talking about so he can't tell me I am wrong.

One thing that really gets to me is that if you ask ANYONE in my city .. part
stores etc .. they will all say he is about the best vw engine guy in town.  I
think he is covering for his sons screw up .. Could they have installed it
with the motor mount already broken ?? there is a motor mount right ?? is
there more than one /?
