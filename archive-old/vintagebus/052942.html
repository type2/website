Subject: Caravelle Camper......

Dennis,

The VW Trends magazine issue was April 2000 and features a customized/stock
'63 hardtop in Panama Beige. No history on the camper conversion in the
article but has the windows and Caravelle Camper decal on the side closet
door.

&gt; &gt; Thom, I emailed you the other day and have a couple questions maybe you
&gt; &gt; could help me with. I aquired a 1964 bus. It has a conversion camper kit
&gt; &gt; that has a emblem sticker that says &quot;Caravelle Camper&quot; on the side
closet
&gt; &gt; door toward the rear of the van.
