Subject: [VB] Acceptable limit &amp; Head torquing
Message-ID: &lt;383C898F.DADF1010_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

At what point should I break down and replace bearings in my RGBs.  The
passenger side seems fine with no discernible movement of the stub axle
either horizontally or vertically.  The drivers side RGB has some play
in it.  I can deflect the tire about 1-2 mm when pulling on the tire
from side to side.  I know that there should be no play, but at what
point should I worry.  There are no shavings in the oil yet.  Its a bit
noisy but not annoying.  I assume this will just get worse, but could it
be dangerous to drive with it like it is?

This bus is a interior parts donor and as such I've only spent the
minimum to keep it on the road.  I don't want to put money into it if I
don't have to .  She's running, turning, and stopping now so I just want
to drive her for a 3rd car back up.

On a different note, when I pulled off the 3-4 valve cover, I discovered
a head stud nut laying on the bottom of the rocker cavity.  Better
re-torque the heads I guess.  I discovered (since I'd never done this
before) that to get to the top head studs, I'd have to remove the tin,
fan shroud etc.  Basically I'd have to pull the motor.  Having just put
it in, I am not going to do this.

Question:  Will there be a problem with just torquing the studs below
the rocker assembly to factory specs. and not doing the upper ones??

Thanks!

Steve
