&gt; Good advice. I maintain a 6 volt battery for my start up stand when I do older
&gt; engines and once a month I plug in the 6V wall wart trickle charger. Another
&gt; good thing is to store it in a plastic battery box or a wooden box, never on
&gt; the floor. For some reason yet to be properly explained to me, a battery loses
&gt; its charge faster sitting on the concrete floor.

Batteries sitting on concrete go dead faster because they are colder.  No
0ther reason.

The real reason for not putting batteries on the concrete floor is that
every battery will eventually leak, and acid etches concrete.
