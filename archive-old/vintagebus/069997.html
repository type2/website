&gt; A run up and down the road without the scoops, and a run up and down 
&gt; with, pausing at various speeds to get the readings should settle this (for 
&gt; a 
&gt; while anyhow).  Might be best to have 2 people, 1 driving and 1 logging 
&gt; data.

Good improvement with the U design.
I suggest reading the pressure/vacuum (the U does either well), at specific 
rpms in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears. The different road speeds at these gears 
should be recorded for reference. A difference in vacuum/pressue same rpm but 
different gears and speeds could be meaningful.
