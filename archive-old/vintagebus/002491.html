&gt;    I recently rebuilt my 1600 dual port and am now discovering what I
think
&gt; is blowby coming from behind the crankshaft pulley.
I noticed a fine oil mist all over the engine
&gt; compartment. It does look like it came from behind the pulley. I read
through
&gt; the archieve to get some more ideas as to what all could be the cause
here.

My first suspicion is that the crankcase is not breathing properly. Is the
vent from the top of the oil-filler clear and connected to the air-cleaner?
Is the road tube (the one going down alongside the oil-filler) clear? If
these are blocked, you will force oil out past the slinger on the crank
pulley. Check the easy stuff first.
