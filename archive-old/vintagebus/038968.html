Subject: 67 Blinkgeber circuit?
Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.904591383.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

I've got a '67 Kombi, which is apparently the first year they had
an &quot;emergency flasher&quot; feature.  This is the switch on the dash that
supposedly makes all four turn signals flash at once to warn that the
vehicle is a road hazard.  Useful feature for a 31-year-old Bus..

Turning on the emergency flasher promptly blows a fuse -- but the turn
signals work fine.  Both are controlled by a big blue relay box labeled
&quot;Blinkgeber&quot; (trans:  &quot;blinker&quot;) with about a dozen wires coming into
it, including feeds from the turn signal switch.

I've started to trace the circuit and the wiring (the Bentley has a page
describing the how the &quot;new&quot; circuit hooks up), but has anyone already
done this and constructed a schematic of the Blinkgeber's guts?  It
looks like a fairly straightforward system of relays and a couple of
transistors, perhaps to control the relays.

BTW, the E-flasher switch simply grounds a lead into the Blinkgeber box
that energizes a multi-switch relay which reconfigures the whole
circuit, presumably into emergency-flasher mode, so the switch itself
shouldn't be blowing a fuse.  The light bulb circuit inside the switch
is fine.

thanks,
