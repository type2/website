Subject: Re: [VB] Gas heater rebuilder Wanted

A few years ago I restored what turned out to be a '60 Eberspacher (same
as the earlier ones).  I sent Ron Vaness a bunch of pictures of the
resto, but never sent in a write up :-(  Still, you can get a sense of
what one looks like.  They are fairly simple.  Most likely problem is
that either the overheat circuit tripped or the fuel pump died.  3 out
of 4 6v pumps have so much resistance it takes 12V the get the
going...after that the seem to work fine.  Its been a while since I
tinkered with them.  I still grab them out here on the West coast if I
can snag them for 40 or so...parts ya know. Here is the link  http://www.type2_dot_com/library/heating/statstev.htm
