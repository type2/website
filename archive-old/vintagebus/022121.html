&gt;I haven't seen anyone contradicting this 42mm claim, but I think it should
&gt;be 41mm. I've done several redux box rebuilds and the socket I use for the
&gt;inner axle nut is a 41mm (at least on big nut trannies).
&gt;
&gt;A 42mm socket may loosen this nut, but it is not the correct size and could
&gt;slip and damage the nut (which should be replaced anyway, as you &quot;damage&quot;
&gt;it when you lock it by hitting the shoulder into a groove that rbns across
&gt;the threads). I would suggest that unless you are going for a similar
&gt;imperial size, get the correct 41mm socket.

You may be right and I may stand corrected.  I use a 1-5/8&quot; 6-point socket
because they are readily availible here in the US.  But go try to find a
41 or 42mm and IF you can find one, the price is almost double the 1-5/8&quot;.

A problem I have run into is about half the inner axle nuts in reduction
boxes that have been into before have suffered from the Muir inspired
&quot;field repair&quot; of beating the nut on with a hammer &amp; chisel.  Not a pretty
sight, and hard to get off (or get a proper size socket on).

In a perfect world we would all use the right tool for the right job, but
sometimes we have to compromise or improvise for those who compromised
before us.
