Subject: FREE Single Cab bed (most of it, anyway)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, most of the '60 SC is cut up or spoken for, but I still have the
forward 2/3 of the bed available.  This piece is FREE for the taking, but
you have to come to Sacramento to pick it up.  I will not cut up pieces and
ship them, nor will I ship any part of it.  If you only want a one-foot
square piece, you have to take it all!!!  :)

If no one speaks for it by the end of the week, it goes to the metal recycler.
