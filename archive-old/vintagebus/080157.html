&gt;I don't know what year it's from, 77-79 is my guess. By &quot;swinging&quot; I meant it was mounted on a pole and swung back and forth; that's why I didn't mention hinges. I think they were dark in color too. I think Karl had one in his Westy.

Some &quot;European&quot; Westy campers had a full width back seat with a seat 
along the drivers side as weel. These also used the &quot;table on a bent 
pole&quot; like Sean is talking about.

I had (the remains of) a '66 like this and I remeber a plate with a hole 
in it mounted to the floor.
