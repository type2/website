Subject: Puck and shiftlock

Two questions for the list. 1. I have an original accessory bus
shiftlock that when installed makes it virtually impossible to find a
gear as everything is so loose. I have seen other repro items that also
have a plate that acts as a spacer-do I need one of these.
2. I have begun restoration on an Eriba puck. I believe it is the only
one in my state and I have no info on the original look, interior etc.
Anyone out there able to help? Are there any pics on the web?
Steve
