     This may be a very stupid question, but this is only the 2nd time I
have
 done a valve adjustment on my own, and I am trying to figure out if I have
a
 BIG problem, or something silly I overlooked.

    I retorqued my heads this morning, and proceeded to do a valve
 adjustment. Everything went fine until I tried to do the intake on Cylinder
 3. I can not get ANY gauge through it, even with the screw backed
completely
out. I turned the engine again to make sure #3 was at fire, still can not
 budge any feeler blade through.

     I have spent the last hour in the archive, but still am not sure if
there is something else I can try...or am I looking at engine work now?
This is a real bummer with a local bus campout only a week away...
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

Oh yeah, its the '70 I am working on currently. (has 1600 dual port, no
modifications)
