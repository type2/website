&gt;Just a quick note to anyone who might care. A bullet turn signal lense
&gt;filled to the line with your favorite stuff is the same as the line on my
&gt;shot glass. If you're ever in a pinch at one of those camp outs, it might
&gt;be good to know.


Now THAT is just the kind of priceless information one can only get on this
list! Easily worth the price of admission.
