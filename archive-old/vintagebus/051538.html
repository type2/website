Subject: RE: [VB] Camper Mag Issue #5

&gt; Can anyone tell me how to subscribe to this mag?  Or is it available on
&gt; newstands?


It's available by mail subscription from the publisher in the U.K.

We also have stocked it in the past.  This saves you hassle, time, and money
versus ordering it from overseas, and we would like to carry every issue.
However, the publisher was unable to supply us with issue # 4; apparantly
they didn't print enough copies.  So we're trying again with issue # 5.
Assuming that they can supply, this means that we'll have it in about 4
weeks (which is hardly longer than it would take to get one if you ordered
it directly from them via surface mail).  If for any reason it looks like
they will be unable to supply, I'll post a note here ASAP to let you know,
so you can order it directly from them if you want to. But otherwise,
assuming that the issue #4 problem was a one-time thing, we'll have it here
in the States.
