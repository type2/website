Subject: Counterweighted Cranks

Somewhere between custom-lowered-suicide-door-with-purple-paint and
vintage-nazi-dorn-bolts-only is me.  I'm building a 1600 single port
engine with a new Brazillian case, almost new pistons, cylinders and
heads.  What I'm looking for is reliable and slow.  That sounds like a
VW bus to me.

Before I start putting everything back together, I'm considering going
with a new counterweighted crankshaft and balanced rods.  Several list
members have extolled their virtues:  smoother operation, less wear,
quieter, etc.

OK, I'll bite.  I see SCAT advertised in HVWs, check out the webpage
still under construction.  RMMW even lists a SCAT crank.  I hear about
Berg, but haven't followed up on that yet.  What I see from SCAT is a
C/W crank with eight dowels, set up to handle the eight dowel
lightweight flywheel.  

Two quesions:

Why a lightweight flywheel and what's best source for C/W crank and
balance rods?

Oh, and (in the spirit of inventory) '67 Deluxe, '67 Double Cab, '67
Westfalia and '64 T34 in the neighborhood.  All mine.

Thanks for any input.
