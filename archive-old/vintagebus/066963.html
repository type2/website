&gt;Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter
&gt;and the later '66 and up versions.

Look at pages H-9 2 and H-9 3 of the '63-'67 Bentley.  Also note that
the &quot;'60-'65&quot; style actually persisted through the early 1966 models,
until approximately 15 September 1965.

&gt;Does the earlier version extend further below the cab floor?

Yes.  The shift rod under the Bus is also supported differently.

&gt;Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to get
&gt;a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.

You'd probably need to get the later-style front shift rod and weld
on the support for it under the Bus.

Note that the Bentley says &quot;Parts of previous type will still be
supplied as replacements.&quot;  Usually this means you can't interchange
the old and the new.  If you can, it will usually have a note to that
effect along with &quot;parts of previous type will no longer be supplied.&quot;
