Subject: Bus on NBC

After almost 20 years of shooting video, I finally shot a story that
involved (well sorta) a VW bus.  They gave it to me...wonder why ;-)  OK
it wasn't a splittie, but it was a Westy ('74).  Bright orange and butt
ugly with a face only a bay window lover could appreciate, but never the
less it was one of the family.

We are doing actor profiles for a new show to dibut on NBC called
&quot;Coupling&quot;.  The owner Colin Fergueson was cool and really does use it
to camp and hang out.  Not too many &quot;Hollywood&quot; actors are cool enough
to own, let alone brag about owning a VW bus.  Great guy.  Not sure
about the show he is in, but it is a remake of a BBC show...arn't they
all?? ;-)

Not sure when the piece will air, but I'm sure sometime this month near
the time &quot;Coupling&quot; premiers.  Check your local listings for Access
Hollywood if you're interested.  In big markets its daily _at_ 7:30pm on NBC.

Just thought I'd share :-)

Steve
