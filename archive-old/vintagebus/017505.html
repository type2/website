Subject: 67 radio removal and other questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am in the process of removing a sapphire V from an
early 67 to my late 67.  Is there something I am
missing on getting it out, seems like there are 4 tabs
holding it in, how do I remove the faceplate. Please
help. Not sure what to do. I feel like a moron.  Also
I noticed on the early 67 that the big black relay has
a little doohicky mounted at the bottom and connected
to the relay.  My bus doesn't have that, could that be
my problem for always having the high beams on.  Also
when using my turn signal to turn left the signal
won't stay in the on position, is that something I can
fix w/in the assemebly or should I remove the whole
assembly and replace w/one that seems ok. I guess if I
replace I will have to remember what wires go where. 
I spent all last night downloading Paint Brush Pro so
I can go to Thom's site and get a copy of the 67 color
wiring diagram.   One last question would it be easier
for me to run wire through the steering column on my
67 to get  my horn setup or remove a column from
another 67 bus that is all wired up and ready to go. I
am mixing and matching between 2 busses right now,
don't want to trade too much but would like to work
smarter, than harder.  I love driving my high beaming
no horn bus around town, just think when I fix those
things I will be in fully operable and safe condition.
 WooHoo!
