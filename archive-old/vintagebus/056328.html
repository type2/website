Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - T1 vs. T3 deflectors

&gt; But what about when using the T3 cool tins as was first posted?  As I
understand it the T3 didn't have the tins underneath.  The air from the tins
went straight down.  I know pretty much zero about type3s though. Everett?
&gt;
All the same tin is there, just with the addition of the cool tin.

New thermostat in my '67 Squareback:

T3 = Vanagon.  ;)
