Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel shut off solenoid?

Here in South Africa I get them from car sound &amp; security shops; they all
stock them. The last one I got was made in Italy; can't remember mnfr.

As Mike observes, they are essential for fire prevention on a VW Bus, and
they make great theft prevention devices as well (fit at base of fuel tank).

Happy New Year to all!!
