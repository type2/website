Are there any other vehicles that have the 
fuel tank in the same compartment as the engine,
other than the VW busses?

There are varying degrees of this I know, with
the barndoor at the head of the pack with the
tank above the engine, post-barndoor busses in 
the same compartment, and eventually getting
a panel barrier, and up to the Syncro Vanagons
with a firewall (sorta) between them, but still
adjacent to each other.

Jeff - bussless and apparently in need of something
better to occupy his mind!
