Subject: Re: [VB] carb matchup and stuff

For about 2 years I kept a 28 pict carb as a spare in my bug.  I actually
think it ended up on the car more than being a spare because I kept having
nothing but problems with my Brazilian 30pict.  I had a stock 1600cc DUAL
PORT engine that I ran this carb on for many, many miles.  It ran smooth,
idled better than any other carb, but I did notice that it seemed to strain
a little above 70mph (like that would matter, heh).  I don't think you'll
have much of a problem running it personally.

Later

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Is there a practical limit to what size stock SP engine you can
&gt; use a 28 PICT before you ought to move up to a 30 PICT-X? Also,
&gt; is there anyone that I can send a carb to to get the throttle
&gt; plate bushings replaced? Oh, and one more thing, does anyone know
&gt; off-hand where to find the distributor list that tells you which
&gt; distributor was originally used in which application by part
&gt; number? I think I remember seeing it somewhere online, but I had
&gt; about 50 Bus web pages bookmarked and can't remember for the life
&gt; of me where to look again!  Thanks!
&gt;
