Subject: headliners - fuzzy vs. perforated

list:

my early '63 15 window (production date of july 1962), came originally with a fuzzy cloth headliner.  with the understanding that someone will flame me for even thinking of putting in a perforated headliner, i am seeking opinions of comparing cloth headliners vs. perforated.

while everyone knows i'm a *stock guy*, the '63 model year was the first year of the perforated headliner (i think).  since i have a '63 deluxe, it would not stand out if i put a perforated headliner in it.  i'm considering doing that if in fact perforated headliners have better longevity, are easier to clean up, are more water stain resisitant, etc.  in other words, if perforated makes more sense from a useability standpoint, then i think i should consider that.  if on the other hand both materials hold up just as well, then i'm leaning toward keeping the bus as it was originally built.

any comments or suggestions are more than appreciated.  i can take the criticism as well, so feel free to blast if you're in that kind of mood today.

tia.
