Subject: tranny swap...axles pull

I'm in the process of swapping the tranny out on my '61 Double Cab.

I finally got a tool that would remove the snap rings from the tranny 
and allow me to pull the axles free. What I'm wondering now is what 
else do I need to remove here at this point. It seems that there are 
parts there that are loose. I don't want to loose anything or leave 
things where they will get messed up.

Right now I'm pulling stuff from the BAD tranny. I'll soon be tearing 
down another transaxle with a good tranny that will go in this bus. 
It's a big nut transaxle and I'm gonna only be using the tranny and 
installing these '61 small nut redux gear boxes and axles to it. The 
big nut stuff will be saved for another project.

So can I slip these axles right into the replacement tranny without 
changing anything else? Or are there some parts from inside the old 
tranny where the axles go that need to be swapped over?

I've got a Bentley and will be looking at it for a while now. Thanks 
for the help so far.
