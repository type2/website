Today I purchased three 1967 buses.

1. PO's project bus - complete but completely disassembled Deluxe walkthrough, all original metal work needing nothing. Has been media blasted and primered. This is ready for paint and assembly.

2. PO's daily runner (quite a few years ago) Deluxe 9 seater. It is complete with the exception of a home made interior and the lack of the center seat. Unfortunately the frame rails are eaten just about clean through and this bus will have to be parted out.

3. PO's parts bus - Deluxe walkthrough. Sad bus, it's been a storage shed and sitting in the dirt a long time. No transaxle, much broken glass, and a smashed roof (tree probably). This will also have to be parted out.

Along with this are lots of extra new aftermarket parts, four centerline wheels with new tires, a complete VDO set up, new tinted glass (very dark), exhausts, carburetors, heads, and the like.

Here's the story: 
18 months ago I asked the PO how much for the lot.PO,&quot;$6000.00&quot; (Insert laughter on my part)
17 months ago PO asked &quot;how about $3000.00&quot; (insert laughter on my part)
16 months ago I offered $1500.00. (insert laughter on PO's part)
Yesterday I stopped by to see if I could buy a door for my SC, left a note to call me as no one was home.
The wife called (THERE HAD BEEN A DIVORCE) we made an appointment to meet today.
Today a deal was struck for $1500.00 for the lot.

Bottom line is do any of you need parts?
