Subject: Re: [VB] Aircon applications for buses

In a boat magazine a couple days ago I saw an eberspacher advertisement.   they are still around and making heaters.
 
Don't replace the stock heat with a additional heater, Supplement it.   Gas milage may vary with a gas eater.   The stock heat is usually not tip top in mosty ACVWs, so wouldn't hurt to scope that all out. But once the bus is warmed up, it should pump out a decent amount of heat.  

  Though on those freezing morning I don't want to wait for the heat to start  working.   I want instant hot air pumped into the bus.  ha ha ha ha

&gt; live in Australia.  Even snows some winters.
