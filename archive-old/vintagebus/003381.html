Man, that &quot;new Microbus&quot; is about the ugliest thing I've ever seen.  They
said they've &quot;Captured the Feel&quot; of the original Microbus?  WHERE?  Unless
they are implying that it has crappy heat, rides like hell, and is noisy, I
don't see a damned thing even remotely resembling a Microbus.

I predict, as an industry follower, that VW lovers will stay away from this
concept in droves.  And they also mention that it would be produced at the
Pueblo plant to keep costs down.. Yhea, great idea VW.. it really worked for
the New Beetle didn't it?

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
