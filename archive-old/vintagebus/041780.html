&gt; I have found that most people use the terminology that the pulley side is

Not correct?  If you use the convention that the front is the part of the
vehicle that arrives at the destination first then the flywheel end of the
VW bus engine is certainly the front and the pulley is the back.

Of course your original response about the &quot;rear tin&quot; was a bit
ass-backwards. :)

&gt; a majority of the people look at it this way (just my experience). So I
&gt; guess when answering a question one must ask if they are a laymen or a
&gt; vintage (you know).

I've found that most non-VW folks consider the flywheel end to be the back
end, probably because of the standard mounting practice of obscure
manufacturers like General Motors and Ford.

Of course, these days most of the engines are mounted in the car sideways.
I wonder how they handle that?

No... Wait...  I didn't really type that!  I don't want to know!!  Really!
