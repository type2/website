I believe early bays up to 73 or so used black round poles, later bays used 
adjustable square metal unpainted tubes. Dimensions should be the same, 
though.

&gt;I can't say for sure, but I am almost positive there was no change. I bought
&gt;one on ebay a while back and I asked him because I think it came out of a
&gt;78, but he said there was no difference. I haven't tried installing it yet,
&gt;but it looks perfect. Hope this helps!
