well today I bought or..traded for a 56 single cab! it is very solid with 
original dove blue paint...but it has a major hack.someone cut the 
bed area out above the treasure chest to make it into a camper!
it has been partially converted back into a truck and came with a 
complete from the cab back 55 single cab .. parts bed??
the funny thing is I already own the cab from the 55!
anyway the 56 is really solid otherwise .even the front floors are rust 
free and the taillights and wheel wells are uncut!it also has the 
brakelight decklid..I will be restoring this back to a functional truck
but heres a list of things I will need if anyone can help...
-brake light for the decklid
-dove blue radio block off and ashtray
-source for the pass side rocker panel??
-truck rear bumper
and I'm sure there will be much more...
thanx for reading-cameron
BTW I  gave a rebuild on a 1600dp in the trade(will be performed by 
list member john morris)!!
