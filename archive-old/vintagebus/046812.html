I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone for their input to my 
question regarding my apparent SPAMMING of the VW lists.  From your responses 
I can tell that not only did my email not offend, but was in fact welcomed by 
the majority of you.  I also wanted to mention that I have corresponded with 
John of aircooled_dot_net and have no hard feelings toward him whatsoever nor he 
of me.  In fact, I feel his intentions were meant to protect the credibility 
of the lists, nothing more.  There's is so much responsibility that comes 
with this great tool we call the Internet.  I just wanted to make sure I was 
being responsible and not taking advantage.  I know now that there's a fine 
line between providing help with parts/items you may need and commercially 
exploiting the lists.  I'll post the occasional information on items from 
time to time, but the majority of sales information will be sent via my 
personal mailing list.  Thanks again to everyone who emailed and offered 
words of encouragement.
