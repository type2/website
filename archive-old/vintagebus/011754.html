Subject: Re: horn repair (was camping/etc.)

Thanks to everybody who replied about the horn wire.
Actually, I already pulled the wire out from the top side (accidentally 
on purpose-I pulled out the horn button while driving and the wire 
wouldn't go back in, so out it came) so I'd have to go from the bottom 
anyway.  Besides, it sounds like it's a whole lot easier that way.  
Clara has suggested changing the steering box oil while I'm at it - I 
think I'll do that.  It's probably never been done.  Send me good bus 
karma, since we're overdue for rain here on the Wet Coast it's sure to 
start pouring when I get under there ;-)
Happy bussin'
Diana


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If any wire can be gotten to through the botton, securely wrap the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;new wire to the old, making sure you can fit it through the hole in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the bottom of the column.  &gt;
&gt;

&gt;&gt;Working inside the cab,
&gt;
&gt;(snippity doo dah)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Gently pull the original wire from the bottom
&gt;
&gt;(Snippity ay)
&gt;
&gt;Geez, I must have been doing this wrong all these years, but I have 
never
&gt;put it in from the top, you have to allow for the curvature of the 
Earth,
&gt;windage and elevation, and then it hits a shoulder a few inches down,
 I take some number 14 or 12 wire and shove that
&gt;mother straight up from the bottom. Ain't never had to do it twice, and 
have
&gt;never had to resort to all of these appliances to get it in.
