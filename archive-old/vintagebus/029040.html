Subject: Window Rubber Glue?

Well the time is almost here.  My double cab is sitting in the driveway
basking in the glow of its new paint and Saturday, I plan on installing
the windows.  The fronts are already in and I know that the rear is
similar to the fronts, no problem there.

It may be that the same glue can be used for all the applications below,
but in case there are different glues required, I'm listing all of them

Popouts - 3 rubber seals.
   1. rubber against the frame of the bus, this seal is flat on one side
and curved on the other.  Does the curved side face toward the inside of
the bus and the flat side up against the popout window?   What type of
glue should I use to fix that seal to the window frame?
  2. rubber around the popout frame, I'm guessing no glue here.
correct?
  3. popout frame to glass seal, anything between the frame and the
seal?

Door Windows -
    What should I use to cement the felt strips in place?
    Same for the little vent window rubber at the front of the frame?

Door Rubber
    Which glue would I use for the door seals?

BTW,
I had previously mentioned that I was going to two tone the truck with
the upper half being the original light gray and the bottom half being a
'59 VW color called Dolphin Blue.  I figured that was an appropriate
color for a company truck for Dolphin Scientific.  As it got closer, I
had second thoughts and opted to keep the truck looking original with it
being a single color of light gray.  I will then locate someone who can
put the company logo and name on the doors, similar to the company name
that was on the truck when I got it.  After all it is a working truck,
it might as well look the part.

Thanks,
Scott
