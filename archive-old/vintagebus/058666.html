Subject: Brake questions

My mechanic says that my master cyclinder is what almost caused me to crash 
the other day. He says he can fix it for 141.00.  Is this right? From every 
magazine i've looked in , the 67 only master cyclinder is at least 200 
dollars. how can he do this? i must be missing something.
John
