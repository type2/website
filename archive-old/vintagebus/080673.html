Subject: Tranny transit request

Hi Volks,

I need to get an automatic transmission brought up to Buses Of The 
Corn. It's currently in CT, but the present caretaker of the tranny is 
willing to travel to VT or upper NY. What I am looking for is someone 
from that neck of the woods who would be willing to bring the 
transmission the rest of the way to Buses Of The Corn.

Anyone who can do so will be camping free at BOTC **and** remunerated 
with the beverage of their choice.

Please p-mail if you're able to help.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
