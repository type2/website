Several weeks ago I posted to the list asking what type of trans is in my
66 Westy (redux boxes, trans has only one drain-plug).  I finally crawled
underneath the beast and came up with these #' stamped on side of case:
		35
		113.301.103
		E

Those are the only ones I could see.  Anybody have an idea on what this
trans is?

Thanks,
Don
