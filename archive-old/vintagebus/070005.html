Subject: Safari Windows

Sorry to bring up this question again, but I don't consistently read all 
messages on the list. I do know there was some more discussion fairly 
recently about choices in Safari windows.

I think someone said Izzy was getting back in business? What was the general 
consensus on who currently provides the best product?

Thanks
Jerry
