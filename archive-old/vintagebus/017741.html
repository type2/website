Garages are actually for storing your project cars
until you get time to work on them, and a place for
your tools. 

Check out mine at 

www.geocities_dot_com/ignatius.geo/leftbay.jpg and 
www.geocities_dot_com/ignatius.geo/image1.jpg

Sorry you don't see any vintage buses in there, my bus
is in the driveway.

&gt; &gt; O ya, forgot the garage part. Garages are for the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Nah, garages are for disassembling your Bus so the
&gt; neighbors don't complain
&gt; and keeping it there so parts don't disappear.
&gt; 
&gt; Kick that new car to the curb where it can get hit
&gt; by the sprinklers daily.
&gt;  The new car is a throw away appliance.
