&gt;Now that we are coming into another rainy season, what do you think about
&gt;applying silicone seal to the cans, will the seal siphon into the cans
&gt;during the dry period or do you think it will be OK ?

If you mean RTV, it should be OK and not siphon into the cans.  However
most automotive relays aren't completely sealed off from the atmosphere;
they do have a small vent somewhere.  It's important to not seal off
the insides of the relay totally.  Drilling a small drain hole like
George suggested will both vent the relay and let the water out.

The Right Thing of course is to fix your windshield seals, as the water
is doing no good for your nose, front floor, etc.  But that's a bit more
of a project.
