Subject: Re: [VB] stereo that fits without any cuttting

I mounted a detachable-face CD player on the package tray right below the
radio and some surface-mount speakers on the underside the tray.  Then I
used a stock blockoff plate on the dash.  I manged to do all this and only
had to drill about 3 small holes in the tray, all easily fixed or replaced
with another tray.

&gt;Well, the adjustable shaft JVC didn't fit - 1/4 inch too long, 1/8 inch

&gt;height ok, 1/8 too long, shafts too fat.  Other than the Radio shack $50
&gt;unit, has anyone found a newer model that fits, keeping the dash stock?
