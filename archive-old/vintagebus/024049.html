7:00am  Decided to see if they had cleaned the restroom.  In addition to
the vomit, someone had taken a dump in the urinal and someone else had
bad aim &amp; smeared the toilet seat.  I decided I could wait again, but Ed
had to go, so he used his best hovering technique.

I love the trip reports and all Dave, but ah...this much detail I could
do with out.  Ya know a lot of us are eating while reading out here!
