Subject: RE: [VB] Jack point repair

It's on Page 4 if you're like me and almost missed it. Nice and simple,
but effective looking.

Look at the tool called &quot;Jack Pad&quot;

best thing in the world for not mashing your jacking points with
hydraulic jacks.

The little jacks are more of a pain than help.  Splurge and get a real
jack. I know they are heavy and unwieldy, but they are so much nicer.
But I do not carry it in the bus either when I go places.  I stick with
some Bilstein contraption that came with the bus :)
