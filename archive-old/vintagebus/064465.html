Subject: Re: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

&quot;loose nut behind the wheel&quot;.........
fact or fiction ?! (You be the judge:)
And what was Barb doing while Eric
was drilling holes all day ?

I prefer antisieze on the castle nuts to
prevent rust-frozen removal.
Probably not good for nyloc nuts.
But you could always notch them
with a file, drill a small hole in the
tie rod end, and insert a cotter pin !
Or peen them with a centerpunch.
Now, does anybody have a ( dry )
torque spec for thr rear wheel nyloc ?!

&gt;We knew
&gt; a fellow who removed his steering wheel mounting nut, but due to the stuck
&gt; taper fit of the wheel on the steering wheel shaft it would not come off.
So
&gt; he decided to put the nut back on a couple of threads and to drive it
around
&gt; till the taper fit popped loose.  Several weeks later while driving at 55
MPH
&gt; on the highway it popped!  Apparently the nut (With the popping of the
&gt; steering wheel.) spun the rest of the way off at the same time and this
&gt; fellow suddenly had a steering wheel loose in his hands.  He fought with
the
&gt; steering while trying to properly engage the steering wheel at the same
time.
&gt;  Fortunitly he made it to the side of the roadway and stopped without any
&gt; lasting damage!
&gt;   Mayhaps we are paranoid, but if the future only holds nylok nuts and we
can
&gt; not find castelated nuts to replace these and drill cotter pin holes in
the
&gt; new tie rods we will at the least drill the corner of the nyloc nuts and
&gt; safety wire them.  Eric did this same drilling alot during his machinist
&gt; duties in the USAF in aircraft (Mostly on C-130s the VW buses of the sky!)
on
&gt; all fasteners.  About the only fasteners not safety wired in USAF aircraft
&gt; are the screws that hold on the sheetmetal skin.
