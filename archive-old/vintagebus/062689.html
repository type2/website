Subject: Re: [VB] still not charging

Thanks for the help guys, here's my current status;
OK, hooked up all the loose wires. using my handy dandy diagram.  Blue to 
blue(regulator) and blue with stripes to oil pressure switch.  Too late to 
fire up the engine, so I will wait till tomorrow, but now I have a green 
light and a red light when I turn the key on.

On another note, my carb drips a small amount of fuel when I adjust the 
linkage, but doesn't drip while running or after, only if your goofing with 
it.  Seems to be coming from where the linkage bolts on.  And that 
linkage,unilink, is crap, 9.95 and I can't get enough throttle to open the 
second barrel.  Proggressive 2bbl carb, btw.  So I am not getting enough out 
to take advantage of my FF tranny, I am flooring it and topping at 60ish 
+/-.  Anybody want to trade a motorcraft progressive carb and some original 
safari frames for a good(complete) set of duel 36 drla's?

Planning on driving to work in the morning it will be about 30 miles round 
trip.  Will let all of you know how things went when I get to a workstation 
somewhere. Off-topic, but are there any PACS ppl on the list?

&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;You HAVE to hook up the blue wire. It is the trigger signal that tells it 
&gt;to
&gt;charge. Right now, it does not know the key is on and the engine is 
&gt;running!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, after some calls and a trip north I was able to get the original
&gt; &gt; regulator and wiring from the guy I sold the ghia to.  Hooked it up,
&gt; &gt; following the pictures and even ran a ground from the alternator to one 
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; the mounting screws on the regulator.  I did not hook up the blue wire 
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; the generator light, yet.  It is still not charging. Did I miss 
&gt;something?
&gt; &gt; Is there any way to test the alternator or regulator?  These things cost 
&gt;50+
&gt; &gt; new, the regulator that is.  Thanks
