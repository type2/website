If you know me you would know the terrible luck Ive been having lately with
my bus breaking down... I Have this terrible mechanic thats just sloppy as
heck and rebuilt my motor about 7 months ago then last month it threw a rod
and sized up, He rebuilt it again and while it was on the bench running it
sized up on him (before he even put it back in the bus!) Well, He did it a
third time and Ive been driving it about a month... Seems to be running
great but thats what I thought the first time it was rebuilt :-(

The Oregon County Fair Part:
This Summer (July 9th,10th,11th) Im planing to take the 64' and head Down
to Eugine To go to the Oregon County Fair. (anybody else going?) Its not
very far from home, I just live up here in Seattle but if something should
go wrong.. What would I  do? Ive been thinking about this lately And was
wondering if any of you guys that live along the way would be able to help
me out in the event that somthing should go wrong?

It's my first time taking the bus out of state and I suppose Im just a
little nervous :-|
THanks everybody, Christian Poage

Also I had another question: Would a governer help prolong the life of my
engine? or is it something I should have as a precaution
