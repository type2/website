The URL is a direct redirect to the site host.   The opening page does have 
a slight pause which looks like a blank page.  Just let it proceed and it 
will take you to the site.   (Just tried it again and it does come up.)  
Sorry for the slight pause but it is required to keep the price of the site 
down and allow for an easy URL.

Thanks for the information.  Please p-mail me if you have continued 
problems.

Mike

p.s.  If you have continued problems you can try the long URL of:
http://duneitrite.excelland_dot_com

Tried to visit the site and all that came up is a blank page.
