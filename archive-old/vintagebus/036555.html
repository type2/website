Hi Ken,
You might want to look for a SO-33 Mosaic Westie interior.  These not only 
were sold in complete Westies, but also for those who wanted to order this at 
the dealer kit for thier early to mid 1960s kombis so they did not have to 
wait for a full Westie for a year or more.  Saw one of these interiors for 
sale two years ago at the NW Vintage meet in Seattle for only 400.00 that 
even had LP refrigeration system hooked up to the ice box.  We even found one 
of these kombis four years ago in excellant condition with only 70,000 miles 
on it, rescued it, found it a good home only to have it totaled in a rear end 
accident six months later.
