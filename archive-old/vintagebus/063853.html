Subject: Re: [VB] re:progress report

&gt;&gt;any idea why you went through two sets so quickly? I thought I read on the
&gt;&gt;list that the urethane mounts were not a good idea in a bus. I don't
&gt;&gt;remember exactly why-something to do with them being too stiff.

In the beginning of august the original nose cone mount broke, it sheared
the metal plate the transmission bolts to from the rubber. I replaced the
nosecone mount and the 2 rear mounts with OE style mounts . I bought the OE
ones from a shop that sales quality, they said that they were the only brand
they could get.
About a week later I'm crawling around under the truck and notice the nose
cone mount has broke. that same metal plate had started to break loose . By
the time I parked it to do the recent work it had broken completely.
I don't really care for the urethane mounts, they are just a pain in the but
, but I don't want to have to pull everything again to replace the mounts, I
cant afford to have my work truck out this long again.
I know a dude with a  panel and he runs the red mounts. He probably doesn't
work his panel to death like I do my truck but he says that the mounts work
fine.

later- Bryan
