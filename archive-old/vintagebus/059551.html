Subject: Window scraper woes on 65 bus

Michael done wrote:

&gt;&gt;My expereince with WCM repro rubber is that most of it is far
&quot;stiffer&quot; 
&gt;&gt;than the original appears to be and as a result makes door, engine
lids, 
&gt;&gt;rear hatches etc etc far tougher to shut or open. On both of my
busses 
&gt;&gt;that I have installed the repro WCM rubber front door window scrapers
on 
&gt;&gt;results in the door binding considerably.

&gt;&gt;Any thoughts suggestions besides chasing down NOS rubber?

Michael,

I know exactly what you mean about &quot;stiff&quot; rubber.  It's almost a soft
plastic rather than a stiff rubber.  The stuff I put on my '67 was
shiney, non-porous crap.  It's been a while, so I don't remember where I
bought it, but I pulled it off.  

A few years ago I did a comparison of rubber products from several
sources and found that Vintage Parts in Glendale, CA had the best rubber
both for density and softness.  Not sure if that's still the case, but
I'd start there.
