 &lt;&lt; so far the only problem i have come across is the adapter has to be 
 trimmed on the bottom for the splash pan to go on, no big deal. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Mark,
 Does this mean you are using the Wolfgang adapter kit?  Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb &gt;&gt;


yes it is the Wolfgang adapter, i got it on Monday and installed it. when i 
got my bus it had already had a single MC from 55-66 bus, so that just tells 
me it is the same set up. there isnt any interferance with the centerpin set 
up either, which i was concerned about, but it clears plenty.

Mark
