Go to your local high school and get to know the auto shop teacher, or some 
of the students.  Most of the shops will have a rim clamp, and the equipment 
to pull the tires off.  Great resource.

&gt; &gt;Anyone ever remove their own tires?
&gt; &gt;  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut
&gt; &gt;the tires off?  Could it be that simple?
