On the &quot;non-standard but functional&quot; tent front...

There are some truly outstanding [and inexpensive] modern tents out there
that would be terrific for a camper tent.  What's lacking is a
connector/adapter to tie them into the side door opening on a Westy, etc.,
to provide weather protection and privacy as is the case with the standard
Westy tents.

I think such an adapter could be connected to the tent with the addition of
some velcro strips/fasteners and the possible addition of a zipper.
Connection to the van could be at the gutter, or to the roof with a
traditional rope hem and molding or even velcro or magnetic strips.  I think
I'd use a heavy-duty velcro strip attached to the van roof close to the base
of the pop-top.  This would provide added head room under the adapter, and
the roof attachment would be concealed and protected when the pop-top was
lowered and secured.

Hey, you asked.....

&gt;&gt;  As far as the tents...funny you should mention that.  My neighbor is a
seamstress who makes most of her money from making wedding dresses.  Surely
tents are easier to make than wedding dresses.  We have been talking about
doing some VW tent stuff.  We are checking into the cost of industrial
machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent &quot;have&quot;
to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent
that
is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with
floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.  &lt;&lt;
