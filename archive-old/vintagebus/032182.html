&gt;&gt; I'm late into this thread, so maybe I missed something.  But a brand new
&gt;&gt; splitty gas tank is less than $150 as I recall (not checking my website
&gt;&gt; right now but I know I'm pretty close).  What's the benefit of trying to
&gt;&gt; modify a bay-window tank to fit instead?

I bought one of these. It is made by RMMW.  It seems somewhat smaller then the 
VW tank and is definitely of inferior quality compared to the original. But
as far as I remember it was cheap, 70some $ and does the job.
