&gt;      1) Pull motor and retorque all head bolts.

Hi Ray,
Actually Berg recommends pulling and torqueing after 500 mi. as I recall.  I
personally think it's mainly needed on a new engine.  All the new studs must
stretch a little, cases might stress some etc.  What Eric mentioned seems
like a good start.  I figure if the lower ones are tight, why bother pulling
the engine to find that the upper ones are tight.  If the lower ones need
torqued, then probably pull the engine and do it right.   I know most shops
usually only tighten the lower ones, unless they are real loose.  Seems
right like you say that it would put an uneven tilt on the head.  Otherwise
why go through all that torque pattern stuff on the heads.  I always check a
rebuilt engine on the lower studs, if they are ok, I leave it.  On an engine
&gt;from new parts, I usually pull it and torque all the studs.
It's good to check the torque every so often as well.  Like maybe 30,000
miles, I don't know there may be a spec on it.  Then you should be pulling
the heads at 50,000 anyway.  Mr. Hoover had a write up on this as I recall
at one time.
