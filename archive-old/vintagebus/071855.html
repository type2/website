&gt; The idea of sealant never crossed my mind so I didn't.  In all the reading 
&gt; I did of the archives/library/websites before and during this job, never once 
&gt; was a sealant mentioned. At least that I came across.  It has been 
&gt; recommended that I use silicone (auto grade). Discussion?

Hi Billy,
Try typing in &quot;axle tube&quot; into the archives for more info or at least try: 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/021369.html&quot;&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/021369.html&lt;/A&gt;
