Subject: Brosol 30-PICT-1 repair questions

Hello all!

It looks like the Brosol 30-PICT-1 in my '64 is in need of a little TLC.
A couple of weekends ago I decided to fire up the Bus and adjust the
carb as it seemed to be running pretty rich per the plugs and the
tailpipe.  Well, after my tuning session, I noticed a film of fuel on
the sides of the carb near the throttle shaft, and also a bit on the
left side of the float bowl.

I'm not as worried about the float bowl leak; it appeared to be coming
from the air horn/body joint instead of the inlet tube.  When I put
a stubby screwdriver on the air horn screws they were 0.25 to 0.5 turn
loose, so that might explain that leak.  At this point I have to pull
the carb off the engine and send it to the Berryman Spa anyway, so if
there is a crack or some other problem up there I should find it then.

The throttle shaft leak seems to be coming from the throttle shaft -
the bolts that hold the carb to the manifold are tight.  I also tried
wiggling the throttle shaft (with the throttle closed) - it has maybe
0.5 mm of axial play (left to right).  If I hold the shaft all the
way to the left or right with one hand and try to move the other end
radially (fore and aft) with the other hand, it also has some play
although about half as much.  I'm assuming this is the &quot;classic&quot;
symptom of worn throttle shaft bores.  I have no idea how long this
carb has been on the Bus; it seems odd to me that something that is
obviously a replacement carb would be worn in what I'm assuming to
be a relatively short period of time.  It could have been on the
Bus as long as ten years, though.

So: it looks like my carb needs the throttle shaft rebushed.  It
looks like Rimco can do this for $30; any feedback on them or advice 
on alternate vendors?  Is it worth it to do this to the Brosol carb,
or should I be looking for a gen-u-wine Fabrik im Deutschland Solex
replacement?  (I know you can't get those new.)  It seems that new
carbs only come in manual choke versions; is it possible to swap the
air horn (top) of my carb onto a new carb to retain the electric
choke?  Any other ideas?  The Bus has a 1500 SP out of a '68 Bug.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
