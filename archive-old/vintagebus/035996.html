Mack, 
the symptoms you describe do sound like a loose engine. This could have
knackered the clutch release bearing
and the clutch pressure plate, possibly buggering the bearing carrier arm in
the process. This happened to me once, many years ago, and I duly fitted a
new bearing, pressure plate and friction plate. Not noticing that the
carrier arm was mullered.
The release bearing duly freed itself from the carrier arm and the clutch
failed again :-( engine out once more for inspection, sorted the arm out and
fitted fancy spring loaded clips to hold the bearing in place instead of the
regular plain clips. Problem solved.

Fitting the incorrect pressure plate is possible, there are basically two
types of pressure plate design, early has 3 arms to carry a donut shaped
disk that the release bearing acts upon, the later have many spline type
things, and as the bearing is kept at a vertical angle by a sleve/tube
thing, it safely acts upon these. If you fir the later clutch into a gearbox
without the bearing support tube, it may well do damage to the bearing, and
or arm.

Clutch cable length correct for an engine not bolted in is never going to
mean anything, it will be completely different once you tighten the engine
bolts, but that the clutch pedal didn't return to upright might indicate an
incorrect (later) pressure plate.

If the engine is flopping about I suppose it could bugger the main shaft and
splines, I dont see that a properly bolted up engine would damage the main
shaft, but the damage could have well been done mostly before the original
failure, then just given up the ghost.

Free advice is, of course worth every penny. These are just my opinions....

Anyone else ?

Damon.
