Subject: Any one cuttin up a bus?

&lt;&lt;I need to replace a rusty spot on the 64 Single Cab for it's
Restoration and
hope someone might have this piece&gt;&gt;

Ha ha. You can tell someone lives on the West Coast. That one little
spot of rust around here would make that bus qualify for the term &quot;rust
free&quot; around here.

I am cutting up a bus, but I won't be able to get to it until this
weekend to see if the part is good.

Honestly, you should see the panel I am getting ready to weld into my
bus. I suspect you west coasters would be cutting it out instead of
welding it in.
