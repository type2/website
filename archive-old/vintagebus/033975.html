To All:

I'm working on Grendel's rain gutter.  

Repairing a rusted-out hunk of roof, right down in the rain gutter, has to be
one of the more demanding tasks I've encourtered.

The interesting part is that, except for three places over the windscreen,
where origin of the rust was obviously on the exterior surface above the level
of the rain gutter (and then grew into it), the other rusted areas were
discovered UNDER the thick coat of seam-sealer with with Volkswagen 'sealed'
the gutter... and originated INSIDE  the bus.

Like most other body-panels, the roof-to-gutter joint is a spot-welded seam.
The gutter itself is assembled from ten (10) narrow panels brazed together
(ie, hard-soldered) rather than welded.  (Brazing is common in coach-work
since the lower temperature causes little distortion in sheet-metal.)  Once
brazed together, spot-welding is used to join the roof panel to the drip
gutter.  Various methods are used for assembling the roof to the different
body panels (ie, windscreen, body panel, door openings, etc) but ALL appear to
provide an UNSEALED path for moisture... even condensation, to reach the inner
edge of the spot-welded seam.

Sounds a bit fey but the bottom line is this:  If you want to keep your rain
gutter from rusting out, do something to seal the INNER side of the seam.  The
seam-sealer was still in fair shape -- a hell of a chore to remove -- but
offered no defense against rust coming from INSIDE the vehicle.

Grendel may have had a little worse luck than most -- so far I've found 18
holes in the roof as well as a couple of sickle-shaped dings that look
suspiciously like heel-print.  Most of the holes were filled with Bondo at one
point or another -- with seven coats of paint it's pretty easy to determine
the sequence.  But Bondo is no cure for rust.   And the roof of a VW bus is
not dance floor :-) 

Dancing on the roof of your bus in the drizzly PNW may be fun but the drizzle
found its way through the holes and following the curve of the roof, to the
flange at the edge of the roof panel... which on the outside is the rain
gutter.

I don't know a good way to check for rust in this seam without ripping out the
headliner and/or gouging the seam-sealer out of the rain gutter.  But the
down-side is that if you wait until rust in this area is clearly evident,
you've probably lost the battle. 

After welding in new metal I'm treating the seam in the rain gutter with
phosphoric acid then sealing it with a thickened coat of anti-corrosion paint
applied by brush.  The stuff takes about a week to cure before I can paint
over it but it should prove more effective at preventing rust than the caulk-
type seam sealer.  The main advantage of seam sealer (and the reason all
automakers use it) is that it's easy to apply and can be painted immediately.
But it simply caulks the seam, it doesn't offer any corrosion protection.

Grendel, my 'good condition' bus.
