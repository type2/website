One of our members took the roof brackets from a Westy and fashioned a
padded base for them. Then he combined that base with a comealong type
strap that hooks across the roof, securing the brackets in place. He can
then set up a full Westy tent without needing to drill anything. You could
easily do the same with a Sundial-style tent which is much easier to set up
and works great for the awning aspect.

Good luck!

&gt;After hanging out in my friends tent over the Classic weekend and becoming 
&gt;re-born in the amazing thing called shade, I would like to have some. Is 
&gt;there any type of tent or more or less awning that does not require holes or 
&gt;brackets in the roof of my bus? I am willing to drill the small holes in my 
&gt;bumper. Just curious.
