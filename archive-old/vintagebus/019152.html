That's another advantage of VintageBus Auction - it's impossible to shill!
Plus, you and your VW friends can both bid on the same items without
creating animosity, because you're not cranking up each other's bids. 
In a small community like the VW Bus community is, I feel that's a benefit.
And of course I won't mention things like the built-in item counters or
built-in image hosting...

&gt; Sounds like the guy is doing the bidding himself. I just got a p-mail
&gt; warning me about this auction. Someone said in that mail massage that he was
&gt; the high bidder but the owner refused to follow through or something.
&gt; weird,
