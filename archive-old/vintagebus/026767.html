Adrian,

I can assure you that your answers from Eric&amp;Barb and Gary are right on the money. (1 to 15 seconds is fine).  I am weighing in on this with a little explanation and since I just finished teaching the chapter on DC Generators at my college, and restored and inactive generator YESTERDAY, the timing could not have been better.

The generators rely on &quot;residual magnetism&quot; in the generator pole pieces to get the process started.  The soft iron poles are what provide the initial magnetic flux lines that are required to get the generation process started.

Since the generator can loose it magnetism just by sitting around, this process is not uncommon and prevents what is thought to be a DEAD generator from being thrown away.

One caveat/word of warning.  Make sure that you double check your connections before doing so and pay attention to your battery polarity when making up the connections.

Scott
