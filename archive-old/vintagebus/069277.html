Subject: OZ bus is home

   I had quite the adventure yesterday. My cargo van from OZ showed up on
Saturday and was ready for pick up on Monday. So without hesitation I leave
Havasu 5 am Monday morning for the adventure of a lifetime (well almost). I
decided to import this bus with out the help of a broker and just used a
logistics company to handle the port paper work, man did I learn a lot. 
   Upon arrival at the docks I was informed that I am supposed to make an
appointment to pick up. Even though the van was just sitting there you need
a union guy to walk you over to it!!!. Then I was told that the customs
office was next to the pier, ya right. Turns out the customs office is in a
high rise in DOWNTOWN Long Beach, got semi lost on the way to downtown Long
Beach from the port but did find West Coast Choppers (aka Jesse
James/monster garage), had to stop there and check it out, wow, but that's
another story. Continued to DOWNTOWN to the customs office and had a hell of
a time trying to fing a place to park the 4 door F 250 truck and the car
trailer. After a few rounds around the block I found a spot, put money in 2
meters and walked the 3 blocks to the customs office. I was expecting to
spend hours at customs and a wade of money but low and behold I walked in,
handed them the paper work and 3 minutes later I had a stamp of approval
and no charges(saved 250 dollars that a broker would have charged to do the
same thing).
  All aperwork in hand I head back to pier F berth 206, arrived back at the
pier to be told come back in an hour as they shut down for lunch (union
again). So I get in line with the hundreds of semis waiting to pick up goods
when they finally opened back up. Got my pass to enter then went to the
office to get the release and wait for a union guy to walk me over to my new
van. My turn finally came and the union guy let me get in his little shuttle
car and he decided to take me on a tour of the pier.
  Some interesting stuff arrives by ship, but what I liked was the 10 MINI
COPPERS just imported from OZ and the beautiful Hatch Top Westy sitting all
by its self waiting to leave this country to parts unknown.
  So I finally get in the bus (has the original keys also) get instart it
up, drive it out of the building, take a few laps around the yard, load it
on the trailer and head home. 700 miles 17 hours on the road and I'm home
safe with my new toy.
