The oak strip were unfinished when I got them, I put on the outdoor urethane, not Robert. I used SS countersunk bolts and lock nuts underneath. If I did it again the holes in the wood could be a bit larger to allow the wood to move. I used a clear construction caulk that picked up dirt easily to seal the seams and on top of the countersunk bolt heads. CR used a thin silicone sealer on the seams. More of the spar stuff would work to seal the screws, or use the pop rivets.
