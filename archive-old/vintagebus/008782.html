&gt;&gt; He wasn't cruising at 90 mph in 3rd gear so I wouldn't hold him
responsible
&gt;&gt;  for anything.  It probably would have blown up next time you drove it
&gt;&gt; somewhere
&gt;&gt;  of distance.  I say guilt him into being your engine rebuild bitch-slave
&gt;&gt;  or the cash/trade equivalent of that.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the insight.  I dont really want much from him but a helping
hand
&gt;would be nice.  He offered to pony up some money to help out some which I
&gt;wasn't going to decline.  I dont hold this against him and it should be fun
&gt;putting it together with him.
&gt;
&gt;The engine had been gone through 6 months ago with just under 2000 miles on
&gt;it.  Mostly all new parts used.  It very well could have happened on the
next
&gt;trip with me or my brother.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again for letting me know where i stand.
&gt;
&gt;P.S.    I wasnt trying to find out ways to get money out of him, I just
&gt;wanted to           make sure that neither of us step out of line, him or
me,
&gt; and end up fighting        and all that.
