Subject: Reduction Box  Noise Solved....

...or just postponed.

Hey everybody.

Well, last week I mentioned that I was getting a strange squeeky scratchy 
noise coming from the reduction boxes or Transaxle in my Baja.

Over the weekend, I decided to figure out what was wrong. I removed the 
brakes and backing plates to get to the bearings and realized that very 
little gear oil was dripping out. As it tuns out, there was very little gear 
oil in there. Aparently more had leaked out from a bad wheel seal than I had 
thought.

Well, all I did was replace the seals in the reduction boxes and fill 
everything up with Sta-Lube 85/90W GL4 gear oil. I drained out the old stuff 
and put in about a gallon of the new stuff (both boxes and the transaxle).

Now I have no noise coming from back there. It runs quieter than ever 
before. I don't remember what oil I used in the past. I think it was in a 
black bottle with a purple label.

I am sure that some amount of damage must have occured due to the low oil 
level. However, I just may have extended the life of the transaxle just long 
enough to consider convering to IRS in the not too distant future.
