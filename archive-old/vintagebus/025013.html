Message-ID: &lt;370AD4BF.CC7C5287_at_mcn_dot_org&gt;

The title says it all.  This weekend I will be dragging a crewcab to
Kelly Park to sale.  Never been to this show before, heard it was
impressive.  Can email pics if your indecisive in going.  Condition in a
nutshell:  No major dents, some rust around beltline here and there.
Rocker by third door will need replaced.  Floors and bed look to be in
good condition with no rust thru.  Gates nice and strait, not dings or
bends.  Engine has 10 miles on it since brand new heads, exhaust, rings,
etc.  All glass good including brakelights.  Missing original rear
seatstand, back bumper.  Kewl :) bucket seats back there now.  I have a
set of crewcab rear seat in mediocre cond.  Not a driver, but will go
down the street.  $2600 obo.

BTW, anyone have directions to Kelly Park and any info on camping that
is supposed to be available?

Thanks

Gerald
