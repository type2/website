hey all...just got a gas heater yesterday...
complete and working to the best of my knowledge.  But before I hook it up I 
want to make sure and see if it is 6V or 12V...how can I check? the tags are 
worn or ripped so I can't see, and the coil doesn't say....  I can't find it 
anywhere on the heater.
if it is 6V, can I use a voltage drop or resistor?
where can i mount and duct this thing?  if someone could give me pictures or 
just give me an explanation that would be great!

there is a tube in my 71 bus that runs from underneath the bus, to inside 
the bus just behind the front driverside kick panel.  it is a little black 
plasic tube (1.5&quot; diameter?) and is rather short and kind of hard to 
find....its kinda toward the middle of the bus in the nose.
what is this for?  can I use this for an outlet (exhaust, intake) for the 
gas heater??

thanks!
