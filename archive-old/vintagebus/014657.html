Find an electronic supply house, like HSC in the bay area and Sacramento,
which will have 4' legths of shrink tubing in various sized.  They
also have select sizes available by the foot - go wild!

The exact sizes are not as important, since you'd be shrinking it anyway.
Just so long as you can get the wires inside.

&gt; Getting ready to repair and install the rear half of the SC's wiring
&gt; harness. I need a source for the various sizes of harness sheathing
&gt; material. Most of the wires are in OK shape but I need to replace the torn,
&gt; warn and damaged sheathing. I don't really want to just wrap the harness in
&gt; electrical tape and let it go.
