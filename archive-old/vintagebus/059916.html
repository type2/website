I'd go easy with the rubbing compund. Its designed to take paint &quot;off&quot; so, if its already coming
off, rubbing compound will only enhance that condition.

If you want it shiny, wash it first with a stong detergent like purple power, then polish it, then
wax it. Meguiars has a good site on maintaining your finish.

**********************
  My Bus still has the OG Turkis paint on most of the body.  The OG
  Blauweiss is fading through in spots.  Would it be a good idea to
  use rubbing compound on the paint?  The immediate goal is to make
  it a little shinier, but I don't want to do anything that will make
  life hard for me when I eventually get this Bus repainted.
