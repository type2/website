Subject: Soundproofing

Cecil,

Thanks for the information.

Sounds like the Roadkill product is much better than the Dynamat Extreme
that I used. I have the entire floor covered as well as the roof and most of
the side walls and doors. (I found it at a bargain price on Ebay) I also
have added a double thickness of what is known as NASA insulation. It is a
fiberglass reinforced layer of aluminum foil with 3/8 inch of fiber batting.
It is still too loud for a conversation or to play the radio on the freeway
and not comfortable on the street. I added a layer of heavy roofing material
(1/8 inch thick) to the floor from the rear hatch down to about a foot onto
the flat floor. I also covered the wheel humps in the back. That made a big
difference but has a slight tar odor. Maybe once I get the flooring in, the
odor will be negligable.

I am also thinking of getting what is known as loaded vinyl. Supposed to be
the acme of perfection in soundproofing. Can't find a local supplier here in
L.A. Probably have not looked in the right places. 1/8&quot; thick is about $200
for 90sq ft.

 Hey Chris,

 Snakebite (it may be called Road Kill) comes in a 3 X 4 sheet at about $60
 per sheet.  I think I out in about 8 sheets over all.  You can put a small
 patch in the middle of a door panel and it will cut the metal vibration
 noise by a huge amount.  I put it all over the van, almost every square
 inch of the inside, completely over the drivers cage and the first
 passenger area.  I put it over the hump from the floor to the back deck,
 in the rear door, the top, everywhere.  Without the headliner in it or the
 interior panels, you can listen to the stereo and carry on a low level
 conversation at the same time.

 Another thing you can do is to spray in expanding foam in the side walls
 where there is space, such as around the very back side window, at the
 deck.

 One more thing is to do something to the underside.  I took the stone
 guard off and lined it with a spray on version of the Snakebite stuff.
 There is almost no road noise in the driver's cabin.  Cost me about $500
 total but it is quite.

 Cecil

 Hi,

 What is Snakebit sound deadening material. Where do you get it? How quiet
is
your bus?  Can you listen to the radio driving down the freeway without
having to turn it way up? I have been trying to quiet down my ride for
some
time with only limited success. Any suggestions?

thanks,
Chris
