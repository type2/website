&gt; You may have done this already, but: it can end in a
&gt; hurry if you don't replace the RUBBER FUEL LINES.  If
&gt; your Bus needs all of the above, it probably needs the
&gt; fuel lines replaced as well.

And make sure to check the metal fuel line where it comes thru the front
tin piece - if the tin piece has worn a groove into the metal line, you're
looking at an engine fire in your future. Replace the metal line and slide
a two-inch length of VW fuel line, split lengthwise, into the hole in the
tin, snapped around that new fuel line, to protect the line from the tin.
If there's a gasket in that hole, knock it out, and do the VW fuel line
thing anyway.
