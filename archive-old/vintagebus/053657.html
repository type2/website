The issue is trade mark law - not vw.  The fact is if you don't protect your
trade mark you lose it.  If vw isn't diligent in protecting its trademark it
will become part of the public domain and anyone will be able to use it.
Your problem is with the law of intellectual property your efforts will be
better spent complaining to law makers.

&gt; Okay, here's one:
&gt;
&gt; I've been at a VW dealership looking at GTIs, Jettas and Passats.
&gt; The dealership knows that I'm qualified and serious.
&gt;
&gt; What is the best way to let the salesperson, who is still calling
&gt; and emailing me, know that I've bought a Volvo?  The VWOA legal
&gt; monster is part of my reason, but I'm not much of a wordsmith.
