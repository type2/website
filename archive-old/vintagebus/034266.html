&lt;&lt;Thanks for the tip.  I knew they had some sort of venting system built in
but have no idea how it works or how to fix it.  I'll try the brake cleaner
thing.  &gt;&gt;
You are welcome!

&lt;&lt;As far as parking goes, there isn't a hill for 30 miles and I think every
time I leave the house I drive 40 miles.  It only gives me problems on left
turns so I am thinking of modifying all of my driving routes so they only
include right turns.&gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
Sounds like you either need to replace the gas cap seal, the whole gas cap,
or you have a hole in the gas tank filler neck.  Only about 2-3&quot; of tilt with
the drivers (USA) side higher causes fuel spillage when the tank is full and
parked so even a crowned road will do the same thing as a hill.  This is
caused by the fuel expanding in the upper left corner of the fuel tank and
there is nowhere for the fuel vapor to go when the bus is parked this way.
So the fuel vapor from the fuel as it heats up from it's under gound gas
staion tank temp of about 50F to the outside air temp or the hot engine
temperature, and pushes down on the fuel and out the cap it goes!  VW about
1967 and later tried to help solve this by making a humpback fuel tank.  The
hump did not hold more fuel since there was no way for the air in the hump to
get out unless you really tilted the bus hard over while fuelingh up.
Instead it allowed for a bigger area for fuel vapor to expand in and reduce
the pressure problem.  Eric&amp;Barb
