Hello all,
I have a question about my reverse light.  My bus is an early 67 westy.  It 
has what appears to be an added on backup light on the driver side rear 
bumper tube.  This bus has only been owned by two other people. The fellow I 
bought it from had the bus since 74. He told me the PO (now deceased) 
assured him the light was on the bus when he purchased it new.  Does anyone 
else have experience with such a light on an early 67?  Could this have been 
a dealer added item?  The light is quite deteriorated at matches the 
condition of the bumber it was mounted on.  Thanks for any help.
