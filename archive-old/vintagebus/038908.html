Volks,
Choose Transaxle Engeering over Rancho for my rebuild. Jeff was very
personable, and told me many enlightening facts, especially about blasting
with media, as I was after a pretty tranaxle as well as functional one. The
claim is that the magnesium pores hold the media, and then later release it
into your trans oil, making your day not fun. His estimated cost was ALOT
higher than Rancho, although I am going for a 4.12 R and P change (claim is
not all 67s already have this, and Rancho said the same) and all German
Bearings. He is also replacing the Pinion bearing, which Rancho wasn't going
to do. The complete cost should be around the 1100.00 range, maybe less is
the core is as good as I hope it is.
Al
