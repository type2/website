&gt;  It's a Dove Blue camper - should the interior (including the dash) also
&gt;be Dove Blue? I know the cargo area is supposed to be primered rather than
&gt;painted, but it's all covered by the camping gear, so I'm debating on
&gt;whether or not I should paint it like everything else, or just have it
&gt;primered and go for authenticity for authenticities sake. Opinions?


If you're painting it for yourself, do what you like. If you are painting it
for a future owner, primer.
