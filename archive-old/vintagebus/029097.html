Subject: re: [VB] shifting probs 

Hey Eric!

For with a sloppy shifter, the first thing I'd check  is the coupling
where the shift rod connects to the tranny. That's cheap and easy to
fix. While you're under the bus, check the brackets that hold the bowden
tube in place, and tighten the clutch cable if needed. Look at the front
tranny mount while you're under there. The last thing to check would be
the shift rod bushings. Those are pretty cheap, too, but changing all of
them means pulling the engine and tranny. Oh, yeah, you could crawl
under the front of the bus and check out the shift linkage under the
floorboard, too...

Saw you in town Friday morning, but you didn't see me 'cause I was in
the Zuzu p'up... Gimme a call!

david
