Subject: Pedal pans?

Howdy, y'all! Two quick questions. I have a pedal pan for my 65 deluxe.
It's in rough shape. What other years use the same pan, so that it would be
a bolt-in replacement?

My second question is, I have found a company that can reproduce thes pans
for me in fiberglass. Would there be any interest among the listees for
such an item? The more he makes, the less per unit cost there is. I'm not
trying to make a profit, just spread out the costs if there is any interest.

Chris
