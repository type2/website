Subject: NQ's RMMW/Bandimere Trip Report Part 1

RMMW &amp; Bandimere Buskatour 2001

 All of us had been anxiously awaiting the RMMW/Bandimere event this year
because for the first time, a bunch of us from the Midwest and of the
Buskatiers had planned to be there.  I had a great time and it's been
absolutely an honor and a mind blowing experience to meet everyone (even
those of you from a far).

 Thursday afternoon at work, I was taking my break and here came Dan walking
in with big old grin on his face.  He was 2100 miles from home and drove all
the way here to Beatrice in his 1958 Binz.  Dan had left Sunday from Florida
and made North Carolina Sunday's destination and then 20 miles outside of
Dayton was Monday's stopping point.  On Tuesday however, Dan put in a full
day and made it clear to Council Bluffs!!!  I helped Dan confirm the
directions to Rob's house and before long, Wade, Daisy, and Kevin came over
to hang out and meet our only Floridian Buskatier (that I'm aware of.)  I
expected to see  Dan the next morning but had a hunch that his early arrival
would open the door for a junkyard trip.  It did.  He traveled down to his
former home state and got that '54 - '58 truck only rear bumper splash pan
that he so desperately needed for his Binz.  Evidently the rust was so bad,
that the rear bumper was removed with a pickle fork!!!  By the time Dan
showed up where I work, he had logged another several hundred miles on the
Binz.  In order to cruise town, I had saved an order sheet that necessitated
that I go scout out an area to deliver a shed to.  I was able to cruise with
Dan to the south side of town and bless the streets of Beatrice with a Binz
Crewcab! :-)  After that little jaunt, we stopped by my house for quick tour
and then Dan ran me back to work.  30 minutes later I showed up here at home
and Dan was busily typing/reading email on the computer.  We finished the
evening with me packing and Dan doing a little maintenance on the Binz.  I
gave him a new oil pressure sending unit for his Binz as his old one didn't
seem to be functioning correctly.  We investigated an engine noise which
turned out to be the fan shroud and fan making a little contact with each
other but nothing extremely serious.  I finally crashed in front of the TV
in the basement around 10:30 or so and got up early to be at work by 7:00.
I was out delivering shingles (driving the forklift around town) and
happened to catch Dan stepping out of the house around 9:00.  He was leaving
to go get Jamie.  I called up Dan once and everything was going just fine.
Around 3:00 - 4:00, Dan and Jamie showed up.  Jamie surely knew who I was as
I was the big guy in the overalls, carrying lumber around the yard.  We put
Jamie to work helping unload Steve Reed's tires from my roof rack into the
Binz and then the guys took off.  They ran to my house, grabbed some stuff,
took care of some email, and headed out to my fabled VW promised land.  I
arranged to meet them there after work.  I met up with them and they told me
they had a BIG shopping list of items that I needed to go get for them.  We
loaded up on drinks and supplies and headed off toward Steve Reed's house in
Belleville, KS.  We made it there in good time.  Dan and I were running our
machines wide open.  Dan could blow me away (due to an advance issue which
was fixed later) and as I was driving my machine floored, blue smoke started
coming out.  Dan was a bit surprised and signaled me over but as it turned
out, it was blowby (ARGH) so my once clean engine decided to start pumping
out of every crack and crevice.  It's my fault for not venting the valve
covers.  After tightening the fuel pump nuts, we went on our way with Dan in
the lead...strangely enough, Dan didn't want to be coated with oil! :-)
Since I had an &quot;episode&quot; with the state patrol last year on my trip, I was
very reluctant to speed.  Dan's Binz was running great and he pretty much
led the way to Belleville with varying margins.  As I recall, one state
patrolman came by in the other direction with lights flashing but he
evidently was enroute to another more important call as he ignored both of
us!  So as Jamie and Dan as well as Kerry and I found Belleville, we
followed Steve Reed's directions right to his house.  We exchanged
greetings, introduced each other to each other and unloaded 8 tires that
Steve had purchased from me.  We met Steve's wife and then got the tour of
the house - Steve's immaculate and extensive toy collection which he
surrounds himself with everytime he's on the net, the VW parts stash, the
roof clip from my old 1963 ragtop beetle, and the key stash.  Time was a
wasting so we all met at Dairy Queen and ate up.  After a nice 30 minute or
so lunch, we made our way to the parking lot where curious onlookers were
commenting on the buses and so forth.  Before long, we headed out and were
well on our way to Kanopolis, KS where Dan's friend Larry Miller lives.  We
had a nice cruise at 70 to 75 mph on the interstate and before long, we were
at Larry's.  It just so happened that Larry's buddy arrived at the front
door just as we arrived at the back door so it left Larry scurrying about
the house trying to accomodate all the sudden company.  The A/C felt good
and it was nice to see Larry again.  He was going to go with us to RMMW but
had a chance to hit Sturgis this year so he was getting ready to head out
early the next morning around 5:00.  Jamie was able to check email and surf
a little bit but by around 11:00, we were all pretty much bedded down.
Kerry and I took the spare bedroom, Jamie took the living room, and Dan
camped outside until the thunderstorm that night drove him indoors.  It had
rained pretty good in the morning, just like it did back in June when we
were here.  Funny how it rained both times!

We headed to the familiar little truck stop over around Ellsworth, KS and
had the same waitress as before.  I had pancakes and the other guys had the
Ellsworth Explosion as it's called.  I can only wonder if the chef was
inspired to name it that after a bad trip to the bathroom at some point in
time. :-)  We ate and chatted and before long were well on the road to
Colorado.  Dan navigated and took us on 2 lane backroads at 65 to 70mph.  It
was neat seeing all the little small towns with their old gas stations, old
burger bars, and just little roadside businesses that are very Route 66ish
(even though we were on 66.)  This proved to be our setting all day long -
we'd see a junkyard and whip a u-turn to go check it out, visited with an
owner about an old Schwinn Stingray bike he ended up not wanting to sell,
stopped and visited with a really weirdo wacked out lady about a bug she
supposedly had but didn't, and then between all of this, we would stop for
fuel and eats.  I was car-jacked by Jamie somewhere in Kansas and forced to
drive the Binz as I was refusing all of Dan's offers to drive it.  I didn't
want to wreck the Binz.  Finally Dan caught on to my game, pulled over, and
via Jamie, ordered me into the Binz.  So Jamie drove my bus and I drove the
Binz  I popped it out of gear right off the bat because the shifter is kind
of messed up.  I hope Dan gets that fixed.  He drives with it okay but there
is an issue with the ball in the shifter coming out of the shiftrod cup
(Dan's top secret theft deterrant!)  Because of this, I ended up having Dan
shift for me.  The Binz must be lighter than a Deluxe bus such as mine
because with the 3.44 ring and pinion that Dan has, he could cruise 80 mph
no problem and blow me away.  As we later found out, my timing was retarded
too much.  After putting it where it should be, I had more zip.

Somewhere around Cheyenne Wells, CO, Dan pulled over and got several great
shots of our buses on the side of the road with nothing but cornfields and
endless miles of road stretching before us.  For Jamie's first trip &quot;West&quot;of
his life, he could not get over the vast expanse.  It's true - there's a lot
of land out here and a lot of corn and other agrcultural products.  We even
caught a couple of cows &quot;doing it.&quot;  :-)

Outside of Colorado Springs, we checked a junkyard that had bugs along side
the road.  It turns out that this is the same yard that Bryant and Keith
visted.  We found the exact same 1963 23 window that had the roof torched
off of it.  We also found a flip seat Westy.  The body was in pretty good
shape but the bus has seen some serious parting out.  It's a walkthrough
with no backs on the seats.  I said it was a hack-through but Dan showed me
that it wasn't because of the clean edges on the seat bases.  As Dan was
trying to locate the yard owner, I had a nice visit with a German fellow
named Kurt.  Kurt and his son were working on a 1965 Oldsmobile and were
there getting some rear window glass.  Had a nice chat with him and had a
lot of fun converting mph to kph and other conversions.  He new of Binz,
understood the rarity of Dan's Binz, and was overall pleasant to talk to.
We exchanged emails addy's and so I must make sure to email him.  I now have
a German contact! :-)  Also we checked out the distributor on a  YUGO and
saw how Bill May's tip of dropping the guts from the YUGO dizzy into a 009
is a cheap way to covert to electronic igntion.  The YUGO dizzy is GERMAN
and looks exactly like a 009.  I think you have to take the innards out and
move them to your 009 as well as move over the ignition module.  Looks like
it would be a fun conversion to try!

In the middle of Kansas, my bus refused to start so I ended up pop-starting
the rest of the trip.  Had to push it at every gas stop or roll it down
hill.  It finally got to be routine but it sucks when your VW is in
disrepair - especially after you keep working it and it something just seems
to keep happening.  So we pop started the bus and headed for Mueller.  Jamie
was riding with me and Kerry hopped in the Binz with Dan.  We finally hit
the Cimarron Street exit and I'll be damned if there wasn't a traffic jam at
the exit.  We sat for a quite awhile but before long we were plodding our
way up the hill to Woodland Park.  I've driven this with my bug and a Saturn
but never in a bus.  Needless to say, my bus busted its rear end pulling
this hill.  I was flat out floored in 3rd gear at 45mph pulling the hill.
Oil temps stayed 180F as the air was chilly and it was raining out.  As we
were on the outskirts of Woodland Park, Dan pulled over to assist some kids
whose bug broke down.  Turns out the points were pitted and the dizzy cap
center pin was busted.  We emory-clothed the rotor and Dan gave them a dizzy
cap (which they settled up with Dan on later at RMMW).  They roll started
their bug and soon were off and on their way!  So were we.  Dan led the way
to the Pizza Hut at Woodland Park and there we had a nice supper.  While we
were eating, Bryant, Keith, Terry, and Rich Kimbrough showed up to say
hello.  I was glad to see Bryant as 2 days before leaving, he discovered
issues with one of his reduction boxes and I didn't think he was gonna be
able to make it.  The guys evidently had wondered if we had made it or not
and went looking for us at Mueller.  I can't remember if Dan called someone
or they called us but contact was established and we met up.  The rest of
the posse headed back to 11 mile and/or RMMWs campsite and after we finished
eating, we headed on to Mueller which thankfully was only about 8 miles from
Woodland Park.  It was a heck of a lot closer than 11 mile for sure.  In a
later post, I'll discuss the various campgrounds so that next year in May,
we can all agree on one central site.

We drove for a few miles and found our campsite in no time.  I was glad to
get parked.  Dan led, Rich  was sandwiched in with the yellow highroof, and
I took up the rear.  While we mulled about getting ready for bed, Rich gave
me a Kokopelli magnet as gift which I now sport on the dash of my bus!
Thanks Rich!  I slept in the bus and it was okay but I'm too long for the
width of the bus.  Dan slept in the Binz and Rich slept in his highroof.
The animal noises throughout the night were soothing!  I heard coyotes and
all kinds of weird bird noises - things you might be afraid of were actually
soothing when you were in your bus!  Anyway, the next morning revealed the
most beautiful canyon before us.  The heavily wooded area and grassy slopes
was just amazing!  I liked this place and regretted that I wasn't going to
be able to stay for more than a passing glimpse of it. :-(

We stopped for breakfast at McDonalds and during the trip down hill, Rich
and I talked on the radio.  Dan forgot his so we just had our idle VW bus
chat about whatever as we mosied through Divide, CO and eventually Woodland
Park.  After a quickie breakfast, we headed to the show were actually one of
the first few buses parking in the bus area!  The president of the company
herded me over to the woods where all the campers were while Dan and Rich
drove around back and parked.  There was quite a splitty bus contingent that
had arrived.  I drove over to see Rob, JP, and the Havasu crew.  That was
one bumpy road over there where the campers were.  I guess the events the
night before and the bonfire were a big hit.  Rob had fun and said he really
enjoyed it.

After a few minutes, I went down and parked by Dan and Rich.   Dan and Rich
were already pawing over the scratch, dent, and ding pile.  They were amazed
at the deals.  It was like I said - just about everything at unbelieveable
prices.  There was a lack of engine parts this time - more exhausts, carpet
kits, trim pieces, etc.  I came home with a bunch of exhausts for my T4
project at rock bottom prices.  We all were gobbling up the deals and in
retrospect, I should have bought a lot more as they sell stuff so cheap
there, you can make enough money to pay for your trip and then some.  That
makes for a GOOD vacation.
