&lt;&lt; I wanted a mechanic to redo the brakes. They are in need of new flex hoses 
and slave cylinders. I took it to one guy and he told me it could cost up to 
$700 to &quot;do the job right&quot; and that seemed on the steep side to me.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
If that includes both labor and parts it is a good guess in case almost 
everything needs replacement/repair/machining.  If you have a couple of 
weekends free fix it yourself and install a 1972 and later dual master 
cylinder to provide about 40-60% of your brakes if something goes wrong in 
the front or rear brakes hydralics.  Once you learn how to fix it you can do 
it yourself on the road if needed!  Eric&amp;Barb
