&lt;&lt; Typically semaphore coils will just have a paper label of say SWF (the
 manufacturer) wrapping around the coil and the small wire leading into the
 light housing is covered with a thin cloth sheath. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Unser the paper label is a water proof tape wrapped around the solinoid coil. 
 Due to automobiles low voltage water, even salt water will not affect the 
voltage much.  The only exception to this is the sparkplug cables due to the 
voltage carried by these is 20,000+ volts which then bleeds off into water 
easily causing the engine to missfire.  Over the years we have seen news 
reports about automobiles driven into bodies of fresh or salt water and still 
the headlights continue to shine underwater for hours.  Eric&amp;Barb
