Subject: changing lanes in my panel bus
To: woody1_at_dsl.telocity_dot_com
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while I am changing lanes from left to right I always put the signal on and 
ease her over gradually , incase any one is there we might only tap them as 
opposed to causeing a total collision  . IS THIS THE BRAILLE METHOD ???
does any one else have this problem?
