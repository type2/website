&gt;For some reason yet to be properly explained to me, a battery loses its
&gt;charge faster sitting on the concrete floor.

From Interstate, at
http://www.ibsa_dot_com/www_2001/content/faqs/tech_talk/maintenance/storing.htm :

Will storing my battery on concrete drain the charge? No. Regarding today's
batteries, this is a myth. A battery placed on concrete will not discharge
any faster, but a battery will discharge over a period of time wherever it
is placed. If the battery has a surface layer of acid or grime which is
conductive, the battery will self-discharge more rapidly than if it were
clean and dry.

This myth does have some historical basis. Many years ago, wooden battery
cases encased a glass jar with the battery in it. Any moisture on the floor
could cause the wood to swell and possibly fracture the glass, causing it to
leak. Later came the introduction of the &quot;hard rubber&quot; cases, which were
somewhat porous. A current could be conducted through this container, which
had a high carbon content, if the moist concrete floor permitted the current
to find an electrical ground. The wise advise of the old days to &quot;not store
batteries on concrete&quot; has apparently been passed down to us today, but it
no longer applies.

As far as storing dry batteries in the refrigerator, a bit of Googling
yields http://www.engineerguy_dot_com/comm/3660.htm and
http://www.greenbatteries_dot_com/documents/battery_myths.htm#freezer among
many other links.  It seems that keeping alkaline batteries cold is
worth 1 to 2% of their capacity per year of storage.  The benefit seems
to be greater for rechargeable batteries.
