Subject: Re: Are anti-sway and camber comp worth while?

&gt;Is the camber compensator for the back better than a rear anti-sway?

The camber compensator supposedly returns the wheels to an upright position
on lowered vehicles. It does this by unlowering them. It is, plain and
simple, a weak helper spring. It is only a helper spring on lowered buses,
on stock height it tends to pull the bus down lower. Installation is simple.
Loosen the appropriate four bolts on your tranny/differential side covers.
Replace with longer studs if you like, but once you realize what is going on
here you won't want to be seen with one. Bolt the center bracket on the diff
studs. Now for the high tech suspension miracle. Lift one side of the leaf
spring and hang the strap over the top of the axle tube securing it with the
bolt. Shimmy over the other way and do the same on the other side. Careful
now, you're really gonna have to fight that rascal up there. You may want to
use a Tootsie Roll or a warm piece of black licorice as a pry bar, or a
papier mache floor jack, or a four year old helper, this spring is so
strong, you know. The most amazing thing this does is separate you from $65
or so without so much as a whimper in most cases. Don't throw it out,
though. It makes a great local manufacture tranny removal aid. Affix it to
your floor jack, bolt it onto the tranny and it supports the swing axles
while you yank the tranny. I donated mine to the charity raffle at last
years Arizona Bus Club Corona de Tucson show. I think I've seen it in the
swap meets on about four occasions since. People apparently form a strong
attraction to it.
