We are headed off into the sunset - or rather sunrise tomorrow morning.
We think we have everything fixed up and ready to go.  We have the AIRS
lists just in case. With the heat and the distance we are going to try
to drive all the way to Jerome.  We know we will be early but we will
work on the greeting committee.

In the following two weeks we have no special plans but will probably
spend time in central AZ.  Eventually we will be in Albuquerque NM for a
week for Busses &amp; Balloons.

We are not sure if we will have internet access for much of the trip but

we will try to let you know how the trip progresses.

Keep a look out for the 59 camper in racing primer gray.
