Subject: Re: [VB] LED idiot lights?

Great idea!!!  Only you need to make a change to your series resistor. If
indeed there is 12V across the LED and resistor, with 330 ohms you are
running about 32ma thru the LED. That is (12V-1.2V)/330 =  32.  The 1.2V is
for the voltage drop in the LED. Change the resistor to 600 ohms. Next you
can increase the current thru the circuit by adding an 82 ohm at 5W accross
the LED-resistor pair. That should give you just about 167ma. Use the 5W
rated resistor so things don't get so hot. Same power dissipated(about 2W),
but spread over a larger area.

Good luck.
