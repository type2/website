Subject: Great Race

I went and saw the Great Race cars roll into Knoxville tonight since it
was announced on this list earlier today that there was a Hebmueller in
the race this year.

Now that I've seen it, I have to say that you should go see this car if
you can. It may not be a bus, but it's cool! 8^) It's certainly one of
the best looking cars in the race. Bill Collins is the owner/driver, as
Thom mentioned, and Guy McDorr is the navigator. They're both really
nice folks and Guy is even a bus owner (there's the bus content). I
think Guy said he owns a '60 panel and a '61 single cab.

I know this is really a Friday post, but the race will be half over by
then. Go see it if you can. The Heb is worth seeing. All the cars have
stickers that say greatrace_dot_com on them, so you can probably get some
info on the route and schedule there.
