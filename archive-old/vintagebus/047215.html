 I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of 
bay-window
 pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I 
allow 
 the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail 
from 
 my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I don't
 support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for 
bay-windows - 
 does one exist?

the impression I got was that you like split busses a lot more than Bays.  
You wanted to start a splitty list back before the list split, and kindly 
have hosted the Vintagebus list.  The way I see it, it's your website, you 
get the call.   If I was you, I'd tell the people who complain to start a 
Baywindowbus_dot_com website, where they can host lotsa pics of bay buses etc etc 
etc.    Why don't any of the baywindow freaks want to host such a site?    
Jeez, can't they take pride in what they have?
