Subject: Virus warning: email from 2000 &quot;Scatterbrains&quot; eBay Semiphore
  auction 

I received an email from &quot;aw-confirm_at_ Ipswitch_dot_com&quot;  with subject titled: &quot;eBay
Bid Notice - Item 266165677: VW SIMI PHORES
&quot;NEW in the BOX&quot; NO RESERVE &quot; with a .pif attachment. year 2000 auction.

I strongly recommend that you never accept or open a .pif attachment.
Especially if it is as weird as this message.

If you are &quot;scatterbrains&quot; on ebay then I suggest that you have a virus and
must take action to remove it. I suspect that you have some form a the klez
virus.

DELETE any message that you do not recognize or have been sent to someone other
than yourself and ends up in your in box. This includes messages that appear to
show you how to eradicate the klez worm and has an attachment file.
