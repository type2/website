Subject: 64 hardtop Deluxe and 65 Sundial for sale in Bay Area
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey folks,

Putting out the word for some friends up here who don't have access to
things like this...

One friend at work has inherited a 64 Hardtop Deluxe walkthru.  Interior is
really nice and even the headliner is great!  Motor is so clean, but I'm
told it's not currently running.  Tags are out of date, but she is working
on bringing that and the engine up to speed.  Body is way straight!  I
think she'd take $2500 non-running or $3000 obo in running and tagged
condition.  She already has some friends interested in it, but I will also
pass along anyone's info if they are really interested.  It's located in SF.

Someone stopped me in traffic the other day and told me they have a 65
Sundial that they need to sell soon.  I haven't been to see it yet, but it
sounds like the interior is all there, 1600DP engine, wood in good
condition, might need registration updated (that wasn't clear).  But he's
asking about $2000 for it and does need to move it quick!  He's in San Jose
near downtown and I have his number if anyone is really interested.

*Sits back and fears a flood of email*
