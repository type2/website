Ok, I am not sure what you mean by what you wrote below exactly, could you be 
a bit more descriptive please.   but if the right side will work but the left 
side does not,  have you double checked the power to the left side with your 
test light, cleeeaned up the ground and made sure the light bulb is good?

&lt;&lt; ok when I put power to #7 the right side brake light comes on but the left
 turn signal does not work when everything is back the right way.

 &gt; &gt; no power to the sensor and the fuses are good.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; If there is power there, check to see if you have power at the
 taillight
 &gt; &gt; bulb
 &gt; &gt; &gt; holders.  if you have power there, but the brake lights don't work, it
 &gt; &gt; could
 &gt; &gt; &gt; be a bad ground, bad bulb, bad bulb holder, do your
 &gt; taillights/turnsignals
 &gt; &gt; &gt; work?
 &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, are you checking w/ ignition on? -------yes
 &gt; &gt; &gt;
