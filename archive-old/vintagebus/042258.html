&gt; Would someone with a pulled engine or engine case sitting around handy
&gt; be so kind as to stick a piece of wire or something in the tapped hole
&gt; in the case for the thermostat bracket and tell me how deep it is? I
&gt; have to drill and tap said hole in my new Brazil (I guess they don't
&gt; use thermostats there) case and I don't want disastrous results.

IF you look on the underside of the engine, you can see where the casting
was made thicker to accommodate the stud.  It's really quite deep.  You
can easily go 15mm deep without a problem.

Hint:  if you're using standard twist drills do _not_ drill a pilot hole
in the case.  Just use the tap drill and do your best to keep it centered.
The magnesium alloy is brittle and will grab the tap drill if the pilot
hole is present.  I had nighmares the first time I did this (with pilot
hole) but managed to avoid breaking the casting.  The second case (without
pilot hole) was very easy.
