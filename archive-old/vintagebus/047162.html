Thats interesting.....
Through 04-59 used one exhaust, and then through 04-59 through 04-60 used 
another, then 04-60 through 61 used another, and then 61- used anouther.
Hmmmm......
59-62 huh?

&lt;&lt;I just bought about 10 NOS German (Ernst) 59-62 bus mufflers. Neither RMMW 
nor busdepot lists them, so I guess they are not too easy to come by.
If anyone needs any (or all of them ...), please p-mail me at 
marcus_at_schaper_dot_com as I am not a vintagebus list member. I have some later 
bus mufflers as well, but I haven't checked yet what exactly was included in 
this deal
