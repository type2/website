InfoWorld, 1/8/01 issue, page 27 has a nice shiny std or kombi splitty. Has outie vents, fried eggs, overriders with a camper cabinet, curtains inside. Westy style half rack on the hardtop. The company is Saga Software, www.sagasoftware_dot_com. 

The adreferences a page, www.sagasoftware_dot_com/imagineiw but it's 404. It's a e-enterprise company, kind of a stupid ad. 

Had a great time at BBBV, thanks to John, Ronnie, and their crew for a great show.
