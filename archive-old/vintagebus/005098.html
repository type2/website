Hey Everyone,

    I just thought I'd let you all know that I added another,. . . KID to my
family.  Joshua Nathan was born this morning weighing in at 9lbs 7oz _at_ 21.5
in long and crying like a sceamin' Banshee ;-)  Mom's doing fine too.

    Now, I know what some of you must be thinking,. . . &quot;That kid will only
have a birthday once every 4 years?!?!. . . poor little guy!&quot;  Well, at
first, I said the same thing. . . until I thought about all that money saved
from NOT having annual birthday celebrations could be funneled directly into
parts for my splitty!!  WOO HOO!!!!! :-)

    See you all at Kelley Park!!
