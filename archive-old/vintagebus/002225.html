Subject: 1967 Bus Turn Signal Switch

Greetings All:

Can't believe it! I have no brake lights and the problem has been traced to
my Bus turn signal Switch. I have called most everywhere WWM, BFY, Bus Boys
and others, no one has one for sale. If anyone knows of a source or has one
for sale, I would be much obliged.

Thanks,

Hart Ponder
