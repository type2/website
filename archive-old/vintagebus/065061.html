&gt; I can get complete brakeline kits easily in the UK, but some companies sell

I've never heard of a modern car having brake lines made of copper!
Perhaps some antiques.  Copper tends to work-harden with vibration rather
quickly, so I'd not want to use it.  Stick with steel with an appropriate
anti-corrosion coating if you are worried about rust.
