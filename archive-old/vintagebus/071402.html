Subject: guages - many questions

I got my guages today (now I can really see what damage I am doing to my
engine)  And I have a question or two.  I think I will mount them between the
package tray and the dash.  The guages in question are a CHT, oil temp and oil
pressure.  I got the dual sender for the pressure, so that one is covered.
The CHT has the spark plug mount.  Does this give an accurate reading?  Is the
#3 the norm cyl.  for mounting?  are there alternitives?  I think that is
about it.  What are the normal operating temps / pressure for these guages?
The engine is a 1600DP with out any modifications
