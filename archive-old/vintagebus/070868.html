Subject: new engine break-in questions

Hope everyone can help me out with this one.

Did my engine break-in over the weekend and I'm not sure if I have a problem
or not.
Did the initial 20 min at 2000-2500rpm. Changed the oil, double checked
valves, etc....

Filled back with oil and took the bus out for a spin, but there is no power!!
Just a little background; 1600dp, stock cam, 69mm c/w crank, 34pict-3, 87mm
p&amp;c's, etc...
The engine idles normally, sputtering a little when rev'd with what seems to
be the rings seating.
Not too sure if I should keep it running at varying rpm's above 1500-2500 for
another 20 min's or so.

Hope someome can help out.

Thanks,
Dave

BTW, 009 dizzy set at about 10BTDC, but when I rev the engine it doesn't seem
advancing on its own.
