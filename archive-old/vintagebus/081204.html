Hi Volks- the type2/vintagebus list needs operating expense money. I don't
know if it's the economy, the war, or that everyone is busy with other bus
stuff, but donations have dried up over the past 2 years.  The list costs us
$150.00 per month for the amount of band-width that we use.

And don't forget- with every donation your bus receives a good dose of
bus-karma........  The amount of the donation doesn't matter; every bit
helps to keep the list up and running. We want access to all the bus
information stored on the type2/vintagebus page and the mailing lists to
remain FREE for everyone, world over.

Donations can be made at http://www.type2_dot_com\donate.html  or mail to:

Ted Finesman

I can be contacted by phone at 1-877-517-4811 (toll-free) if anyone has any
questions. Thanks for your help..... Ted, list treasurer.



Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it....
