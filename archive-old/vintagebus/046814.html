Subject: engine problem and tranny noise
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi:
When I adjusted the timing today I found that the original timing is 30-40 
degrees BTDC. That's terrible.  I've put about 1500 miles on the engine with 
the wrong timing.  Can anybody tell me how much and what kind of the damage 
would my engine have suffered(it runs well now)?  Also when I backup my bus, 
depress the clutch pedal but remain the shift in reverse gear, I can hear a 
weird noise from the rear(I never notice that before).  Can anybody tell me 
what's wrong with my tranny?
Thanks,
Michael
