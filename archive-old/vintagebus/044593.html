     Went to the West Palm Beach show yesterday, and was able to look at some
pictures that some friends took while in California. Among seeing alot of pics
of Everett's BD, I saw a pic that scared the poop out of me! At first I
thought it was a BD Deluxe with the roof cut off, but learned that it was not
a true BD, is this true? And who won the long distance award at the SOTO meet?
              Mike
