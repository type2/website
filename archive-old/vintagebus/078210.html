Subject: RE: [VB] Re: 65 new transmission/coupler

Yup! I use it everywhere except sealing the two halves of the engine block
(Permatex Aviation Sealer 3H), and weatherstrip around the doors (3M
80001). Though Mark D just said that Permatex &quot;Right Stuff&quot; is better -
I'll have to investigate a tube of it - never saw or heard of it.

&gt; I agree with Cal. I used Blue religiously for thermostat housings and

&gt; the the Ultra gray/black is the best for the tranny job as far as I'm
&gt; concerned. Seen it used on the seals of the RGB also.
