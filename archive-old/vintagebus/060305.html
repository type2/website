Subject: Re: [VB] BASF paint codes 

I live in a relatively small city - 116,000 people. I'm only a couple hours
from Ottawa, Toronto, and Montreal so I can get about any paint I want ....
but - the Local guys sell Dupont and RM (BASF).  I like to shop local so I'd
like to deal with them.  They tell me that I canna get Dupont in Mango
Green - apparently there are three lines of Dupont Paint, Lucite being one.
They say that I can not longer get Mango Green in Lucite in Canada ... I
dunno why.  Anyway, I can get RM brand paint (BASF) and mixed in Mango Green
... So I'm a lookin' for the code - actually, I suspect I found it.  I went
to the BASF page and went to Glasurite and used the VW codes and .....I'll
find out tomorrow if it works.

So two people asked me why I wanted Glasurite (BASF) paint?  I'm wondering
why they asked?  Isn't Glasurite very good paint?
