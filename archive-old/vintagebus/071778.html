Hi Sean,
Install 12 volt sealed beam bulbs, buy a six volt battery and a six volt 
charger.  This should work for maybe a half hour before needing to shut down the 
headlights for the battery to recharge.  We would go ahead and install 12 volt 
bulbs with 12 volt battery and charging system and just aim the headlights 
real low.  If you want longer operating lights you will need to install more 
batteries in series and/or buy a bigger amperage battery charger which will cost 
more toward $100.00 range.  DO NOT use the charger setting for starting an 
engine, that destroys batteries!
