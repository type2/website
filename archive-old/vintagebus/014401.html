Thanks for all of the responses. General opinion is
that the BOCAR is not a POS as stated but watch out
for the dime sized plug in the rear &lt;R.I.R.~ Muir&gt; of
the carb body. 
All is right with the world again. Dragged out the
die-grinder and did the nasty deed. Not a biggie once
I got after it and &quot;over&quot; it. Tightened a few screws
here and there which were quasi-loose. Re-adjusted the
squirter zoobie as recommended in that Oct 99 VWTrends
article. My efforts seemed to have cured the ills
dujour. =)
Forgot to mention that I am running a nice and tight
010 in a stock 1600DP. Had good luck with a vacuum
dizzy but decided to switch for awhile starting last
Summer.
Sidebar story: Had to laugh at myself towards the end
of the minor operation. Had everything in place and
was ready to roll but couldnt get it started! Triple
checked everything! Reset the points and initial
static timing several times. Removed the carb again
and checked for squirter action and potential stuck
float. NOTHING helped? Rotor in? Yup! I was ready to
rant per the usual decided on logic, a few steps back,
a flashlight and a Marlboro over emotion.
Mr.Flashlight told me that the coil wire was off at
the coil end. The long shadows of the day were
tricking old VanBondo. Now  THAT can slow you down. =)
Learn the basics Ellis! Learn the basics!
The &quot;Ratbus&quot; lives for another day. It's showertime.
