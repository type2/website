&gt; Ummm... why don't we just switch to yahoogroups or topica or something??
&gt;
&gt; &gt; On the money front, the colocation in Seattle will run $150 per month.
The
&gt; &gt; machine to put in the rack will probably run $1,000-$2,000, depending on
&gt; &gt; what we buy.  The proposal of how to deal with these incipient expenses
is
&gt; &gt; to hold a fund raiser.  Over the next couple weeks, a call will be made
to
&gt; &gt; the members of the list (that's *you* :-) to donate money for both the
&gt; &gt; machine and the colocation fee.  The box will (I hope) be a
non-recurring
&gt; &gt; expense, but the colocation fee is going to go on forever :-)  The exact
&gt; &gt; process has not been decided, so hold on a bit, but there will be a post
&gt; &gt; announcing this fundraiser within the next week or two.
