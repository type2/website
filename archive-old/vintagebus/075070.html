Subject: New engine cases

   Thought I could pass this on. I just recieved a better deal from one of
my importers on NEW Brazil/Brazil universal cases. These are Genuine VW de
Brazil cases, NOT the aluminum ones. I have been using these to build all of
mine and customers engines for the last 3 years with-out a problem, the best
deal is I can offer them for $275.00 dollars each, $25 dollars less then
before. This is a limited offer and when they are gone they are gone. These
are the universal cases with the type 3 filler hole in the with the mounting
boses for a bus. These also do not have the mounting studs, gen stan studs
or fuel pump studs. I do offer a stud kit from Germany that has all parts to
complete the case including new oil relief plungers and springs. These kits
are German.
