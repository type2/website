       There is a third option a listee pointed out to me when I nearly used
a cheap set of early Ford Limmo (15&amp;1/3&quot;) wheels on my splittie.
You can take the rims and a brake drum to a wheel and rim works and have
them turn out and redrill the centers of the rims to suit a VW.This wiould
mean you can choose from any # of Alloy rims as the stud holes are
inevitably further out on a VW, well a proper one anyway

&gt; My Fellow Vanatics,
&gt;
&gt; When using custom wheels on a splittie,I have read that wheel adapters
&gt; are not the greatest idea because the rim/tire gets pushed out so far
&gt; that it scrapes the inside of the fender. In order to compensate, one
&gt; could use rims with negative offset, but I think I've heard that offset
&gt; rims cause excessive wear to wheel bearings, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Another approach is to use standard drums redrilled for a different lug
&gt; bolt pattern.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone shed some light on the Pros &amp; Cons of these two approaches?
&gt; What combinations have worked for you?( I know this could be a can of
&gt; worms, but...)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave
&gt;
