Hey, that's weird. A couple of months ago I was helping a guy change his
channel felts from one of those cheap J.C. Whitney kits and noticed three
little tubes on each side. They were welded from the bottom and flush on the
top and there was paint on them so I thought they were factory.

If the problem of rust in the lower channel of the front windows is from
rain,
and moisture, setting in there.  Why not drill a couple of small holes and
insert tubes.  The tubes could have hose attached and routed out one of the
holes in the inner nose and to the outside.  Anyone tried this before or
think
it would help?
