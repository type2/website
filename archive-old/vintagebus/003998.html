Good morning, It's Friday

I have been realy inspired by Kyle's porcine post scripts.  However, since I
am not as intimately acquainted with pigs, I can only submit the following:

It seems that one of our local farmers had several pigs, all sows.  He
wanted to increase his herd, so he aranged with a neighbor to have his boar
service them.  The neighbor explained that the boar did his best work very
early in the morning.

So promptly at 4:30 a.m. the framer loaded his pigs into the back of his
1964 single cab, no easy job.  (note the bus relevance).  He took the sows
to the neighbors, and the boar performed admirably.  AS he was leaving, our
farmer asked how he would know if the pigs were pregnant.  The neighbor
explained that if the next morning they wer feeding at the trough they were
pregnant, but if they were rolling in the mud, they needed to come back.

Well, the next morning early the farmer checked, and the pigs were in the
mud.   So he loaded them in the single cab again, and took them to see the
boar.  This went on for a whole week, until finally one morning he was too
tired to get up.  He asked his wife to look out the window and see what was
happening.  When she did, she burst out laughing.  The farmer asked what was
going on, to which his wife replied &quot;All thi pigs are in the back of the VW,
except one, who is in the cab, honking the horn!&quot;
