Subject: Re: [VB] M/C on '67

There is a west coast supplier that puts one of the ATEs on eB*y from
time to time.  The last one I noticed sold 2 weeks ago for $150.

As for rebuilt MCs, FWIW some have opined in the past that a rebuilt MC
can lose some of its stopping power and/or safety once the barrel is
honed, and should be avoided if possible.  But I imagine that lots have
done it without a problem, as well.

&gt; It looks like there is a slow leak on the master cylinder in my '67.  I just
&gt; did a quickie on-line price check.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;GULP&gt; $175.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize it is a 'one year only' item and unless I dont want to stop I
&gt; really dont have much of a choice in the matter.  Has anybody else out there
&gt; seen them cheaper?? How about a rebuilt one??
