1959 Bus
Overhead fresh air directional control handle (not handle on the forward fresh air box)

My question has to do with how this bugger goes back together.  Inside the overhead box there is the center piece that the left and right deflector plates are attached to.  Below that center piece is a friction washer, then the spring.  On the outside of the box is the handle and chrome shouldered screw. 

1.  Is there also a friction washer that goes between the handle and the box itself?  

2.  Is there a wavey washer between the screw and the handle.  

Mine was disassembled when I got it, and the workshop manual goes into minimal detail.

TIA.

Robert
