I am a music teacher at a public elementary school in Colorado Springs.
I have 550 students, half of which I see each day for 1/2 hour per
class. It's a kick in the butt, but the pay sucks. Not complaining, just
reality. I have to work all Summer, but I get to do lots of other types
of jobs, (including VW's)  which is cool.

Yes, Columbine freaked my students out. We're better now.

I also sing in an A Cappella (no instruments) group called &quot;Cool Shooz&quot;
We sing classic Rock 'n Roll using five vocalists and one vocal
percussionist. Definitely NOT barbershop.

Been cool finding out what you all do. Lotsa brains on this List, but I
knew that already.

This has been a long Friday, hasn't it??

Dave
