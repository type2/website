I Have noticed that there seems to be two colors of interiors for these 
buses, one with more blue in it, and one with more green in it, with the 
center section of the door pannels being the same. Anyone know what gives? 
yearly? Also, Isaiah I have a 63 standard that is mostly original paint, but 
is not nice. I could eventually send some pics. if interested e-mail.
&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 Does anyone have any pictures of a NICE turquoise bus?  If any of you
 own one, in any shape, let me know.  I'm looking for pictures of a white
 over turquoise standard...  That and pictures of an all turquoise
 interior.  The bus can be original or restored...  I've searched
 thesamba and vintagebus and came up with only 1 or 2 pics.  Turquoise
 was a 2 year only color correct? 62 and 63?  I'd like to see pics of a
 62...but there really isn't THAT big of a difference between the
 years...just mainly the front seat configuration...so its not a big
 deal.
 
 let me know if you can help me out...
 Thanks!
