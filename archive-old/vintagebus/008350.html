&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; As long as this is done in an instant it is not a bad thing.  We have
known
&gt; others who haved used this slipping of the clutch all the time while
waiting
&gt; at lights on hills which causes the clutch to wear out very quickly here
in
&gt; hilly Western Washington State.   Eric&amp;Barb

Exactly which is why I specified that you switch your foot from the brake to
the gas when you take off.  Never should one ever have the clutch out and
brake on for extended periods of time.
