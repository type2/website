Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Wiring Question

Volksperts,

I am wondering what the vintage, original size tires were for the later
year busses, 65-67?    I know the sizing standard is different now, so
what is that sizing today.  I know they were 14 inchers, but what size? 
Also, what size are the stock rims?  14 x 4 ½?  5?  5 ½?
