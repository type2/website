Subject: how to rebuild engine video

hi favorite list!, I took my tired but good engine out to investigate why
all my oil is disappearing. It wasn't leaking from the oil cooler like I
suspected, but from somewhere behind the cylinder 3&amp;4 head. And I noticed
one of the top middle 15mm nuts had backed itself off. So, I thought I'd
torque the heads to 23ft. lbs. and be good to go. But when I started
tightening the loose nut it start pulling the stud out of the case. It's
an &quot;H&quot; case and does not appear to have heli-coils or case savers. So
what should I do from here? I've never rebuilt an engine but want to
learn how, and might like to have case savers installed. I have the
Bently, Wilson, and Idiot ( my personal favorite : ) books, but am still
unsure about being able to do a rebuild. are the how to rebuild engine
videos very good? can I watch one and learn most of what I would need to
know? and who makes the best video? TIA for any advice.
