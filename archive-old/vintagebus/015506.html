Subject: help to fill a 3/16 hole??
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 2000 13:33:48 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

hey all,
the previous owner of my bus took really good care of it but did a few dumb 
ass things like every PO it seems... there were these tie downs pop riveted 
all over her and each one left three 3/16&quot; holes where attached. (two right 
through the front emblem??) how can i fill these? was thinking of using the 
mig and turning wire speed UP and the voltage DOWN.... also thinking of 
sticking a piece of tape on the INSIDE of the hole and bondoing them, then 
remove the tape after hardened. if i weld them up and grind ill have to use 
filler anyway to smooth out. he put shoulder belts in the back seat by 
drilling 2&quot; lag bolts right through the sides too :0

ALSO, check this out... i took the front door panels off to take out door 
handles and there was half a COMFORTER on each side. yes, you read that 
right a big fluffy COMFORTER. luckilly it didnt seem they were in long, nice 
and dry in there, one little bit of rust.

later, thanks for the help!
