What a day.  What a night.  I'm exhausted.  Two hours sleep doesn't do much good.

A lead from Rex Eastman, that I'll be thanking him for a long time, led me to Orange County yesterday.  The purpose, to see an early '59 Mango Green Flip Hatch Westfalia that was *kinda* for sale.  Very original, mint tent and mint bag with the potty room, one year only poles and bag, original roof rack, rear storage ice box in mint condition.  The bus, originally from California with original plates, had been sitting in Eastern Oregon since 1973.  Very, very minor rust.  A section of the front right cab floor corner and the bottom cargo door seal lips, exterior skins fine.  Never wrecked, absolutely no nose damage.  Solid rockers, solid doglegs, original battery tray, 6v, uncut dash.  One golfball size dent on the left rear corner beltline and a 12&quot; minor crease on the left lower skin above the rocker.  Gold/black checked seat cushions, one shot so will need to be replaced, somehow.  Tumblers and holder missing. Mint conditon clam shell lights, all curtain rods there but curt!
ains had dissinegrated.

Needless to say I bit the BIG one and bought it.  Sticker shock wore off after about 12 hours.  You only go around once in life, might as well do it in an early Westy.  M-code data to follow.  The camper search is over, now the real journey begins.  First I need to get some sleep.
