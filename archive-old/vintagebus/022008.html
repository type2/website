&lt;&lt;  Not to be too negative. but I strongly suspect that VW is only interested 
in selling new VW's. Proof positive; quick poll, how many aircooled owners 
have had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with 
service/parts? &gt;&gt;

I think a big reason they are doing it is to protect their trademark.  
Q-tips, Kleenex, Caterpillar, etc., are all trademark brand names that the 
general public uses for all or most products in their given category.  
Companies must &quot;actively&quot; protect their trademark or risk losing it. 

...now if VW would lease the rights to it for a given (non-mechanical) 
product for a reasonable fee is a totally different story.
