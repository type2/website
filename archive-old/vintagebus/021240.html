Subject: New Member, but I got here as fast as I could...

Hey there Volks,

Just wanted to introduce myself. I've been lurking on the web
reflector for awhile doing &quot;research&quot;, and for the past few months
I've been lurking in digest mode.

I've been a member of the type2 list since 1998. My current bus is a
79 westy. Yes, I drive a &quot;fat chick&quot; bus. I had a 78 westy before
that. I'm 35 yrs old, single, and employed as a computer programmer.
I've always been interested in getting a split window bus, but
because of my living situation (condo assoc. is a real pain about
&quot;extra&quot; vehicles), I haven't been able to follow thru w/ my plans of
buying a splitty project.

I just bought a house (closed on it yesterday). It has a 2 car
garage, and a private 1/2 acre lot. Read private as: I can stick a
few projects in the back w/o the neighbors complaining. With
somewhere to store a project, and a garage to work in, I'll finally
be able to &quot;go vintage&quot;. I'll also be able to get some things done on
the 79 that I didn't want to tackle in the condo parking lot.

I'll be looking for a single cab, kombi, or standard project from the
New England area. I have entertained the idea of shipping a bus (or a
&quot;fly in drive out&quot; deal) from a rust free area, but I think I'm gonna
see what I can turn up locally first. Hmmm.... There is that 67 SC
for sale up in NH on thesamba_dot_com, but rust in the treasure chest
kinda scares me.

Thanks for the daily dose of vintagebus Q and A that has helped me
learn alot about vintage buses w/o actually ever owning one.

Later...
