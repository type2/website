Subject: Re: [VB] Dealership woes down south...

You know, just from my personal experience I would never buy a car from someone named Jim Ellis....maybe I should post a reply to that forum about my crappy VW buying experience.  You should see their half ass dealership in Phoenix.. I thought I'd get carjacked on the test drive.  Then on top of that,  The salesman helps me load my interior in. In PIECES!   Missing hubcaps, heater doesn't work.....Geez.  Then has the nerve to tell me it's sold with no warranty.  
What a joke....that rat bastard will never get my business again!

But on a high note:  You should of see this ragged-out POS F-150 I traded in on the bus!   Man..what a piece!

&gt; Take some time to check out this thread:

&gt; 
&gt; I see quite a bit of unusual stuff on that site, but have been
&gt; consistently amazed at how many people from all automotive circles are
&gt; joining up just to post their concern and support. Heart-warming...
&gt;
