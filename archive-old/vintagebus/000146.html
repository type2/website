&quot;running gear&quot; is the type of shoes that the owner of the bus was wearing at 
the date it was sold.
Try footlocker......

Two sincere questions for the list ( not flames, I really want to know!)

a: Why would you want to narrow a bus front beam?

b: What all do you guys commonly think of as &quot;running gear&quot; ???
I thought it was drive train and rear axles/redux
boxes/spindle/drum/wheel..... Does front end get in there too?
Not that it is terribly important, but it is nice to know what we are
all talking about when we use this jargon....
