Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

----- Original Message -----
&gt; Has anybody used one of those wire-feed welders
&gt; (gasless, flux core wire) for welding body panels on a
&gt; bus?  How do they work? What was your experience? Any
&gt; tips for a rookie welder?
&gt;
After 3 years of welding classes in High School, I learned not to skimp on a
welder. El-Cheapo welders will not get the penetration that you need, and
will make gloppy welds no matter what you try.

When it came time for me to buy my own welder, I went with the largest that
Sears carried that would still plug into 110v. I really didn't want to go
through the hassle of wiring a 220 plug in my garage, and I also have found
it extremely handy to take with me places to weld for friends and stuff.

Also, make sure you get one that uses gas, it will make things a lot easier.
I filled a waist high bottle about 3 years ago, and it still haven't used it
all up. I've been very happy with it.
