 &lt;&lt; Subj:	 Brake lights don' work. HELP
 
  The brake lights on my 65 panel stopped working. Turn signals and tail
  lights work. Bulbs are fine. I just adjusted the brakes. Could the pedal
  not be making the connection anymore?
  
  Thanks

James,

Forget the pedal.  It has nothing to do with the problem in the sense you
mean.

The electrical switch that turns your brake lights on &amp; off is actuated by the
hydraulic pressure in your brake system.  

The brake-light switch is similar to the one used for the oil-pressure warning
light circuit except for having two spade-lugs instead of one.  But don't get
them confused.  They are entirely different forms of switch and are not
interchangeable. 

The brake-light switch is located on the rear of your master cylinder.  If it
is bad, it must be replaced.  Replacement of the brake-light switch means
opening the brake system at the master-cylinder (that is, when you unscrew the
old switch the brake system is then open to the atmosphere), which means a
full, four-wheel brake-bleed must be done after replacing the switch.

So let's make sure it's broke before we fix it.

Power for the brake lights comes through your ignition switch (it must be on)
then thru a fuse (I think #8 on your model year -- check the end fuses) then
to the brake-light switch.

To insure all that is happening, start by disconnecting the negative lead of
the coil from the distributor.  That will prevent you from frying your points
(you're going to do some tests with the ignition switch on -- if your points
are closed, they'll be carrying ten amps of current.  It takes only a few
minutes of constant 'on' time to cause the points to overheat and weld
themselves shut). 

With the ignition disabled, turn on the key and crawl under the vehicle with
your static timing light -- you're going to use it as a volt-meter :-)  (Make
sure it's working first -- test it using the positive lead at your coil.)  

Find a good ground for one lead of your timing light.  This can be hard to do
under the vehicle -- most are rusty as hell.  (If you bus is rusty, sand a
bright spot for the ground lead... and plan to deal with the other rust as
soon as you can.) When you have a good ground connection, use the other
connection  of the timing light to determine which of the two leads to the
brake-light switch is the hot side.  Your timing light will go on when you
find the hot lead.

Okay so far?  We've just determined that the circuit from the ignition switch,
to the fuse, through the fuse and to the brake-light switch is functional.  

If your test-light did NOT come on, find out why -- your lack of brake lights
may be due to a lack of power to the brake-light circuit.  (The most common
cause of the 'no brake light' complaint is a blown fuse.)

Okay, you got power to the brake-light switch.  Unplug the OTHER lead on the
brake-light switch and touch it to the first lead -- the one on the other
terminal --where you know you have power.  This should cause your brake-lights
to come on.

If you're working alone, affix the leads together.  The alligator clips on
your timing light make a handy clamp. Ditto for a jumper-lead.  (a couple of
which should be in your tool kit) 

If your brake lights do NOT come on, the problem is in the wiring between the
brake-light switch and the brake-lights.

Okay, they came on.  Turn them off by disconnecting the lead.  

At this point we've finally arrived at testing the brake-light switch itself. 

About half the complaints of 'no brake lights' involve a failure among the
items we've just tested, another twenty-five percent or so involve grounding
problems in the tail-light fixtures, bad bulbs and so on -- I've removed those
from the diagnostic because you've said the turn signals are working normally.

When someone complains of no brake lights, the brake-light switch is at fault
only one time in four, or thereabouits.  Yet for some reason it is the FIRST
thing people replace, often to no avail.  Because of the need to bleed the
brakes after replacement of the switch, the wiser course is to eliminate all
other possible causes of failure.  (Did I mention that a blown fuse is the
most common cause of failure?)

Now let's see if the switch works.  To do that, connect the hot lead of your
timing light (that is, the lead which is not grounded) to the other terminal
of the brake-light switch.   Now pump the brakes.

If the light does NOT turn on, the switch is bad.  Replace the switch, bleed
the brakes and re-check the system.

If the light DOES turn on, your vehicle is cursed.  Go buy four black chickens
and meet me at the nearest VW dealer at midnight next Friday.   (I know, I
know... you've seen a procedure in DB&amp;HVW that uses a blond virgin instead of
four black chickens.  Well, if you can FIND a virgin of legal age, bring her
along and I'll show you how it's done... but I'll tell you right now NOS
virgins are virtually NLA in southern California, which is why all of the
mechanics I know have replaced the original Nordic Ritual with the Brazilian
routine.)

Bleeding your brakes is not just getting the air out, it's a standard
maintenance procedure done every other year in order to REPLACE your brake
fluid.  You simply keep puming until you see clean fluid coming from the
bleeder.  Provide yourself wit the proper tools and at least two pints of
whatever brake fluid you are using.  You shouldn't need that much and you
should already have a pint in your on-board spares -- the extra pint is in
case you need it, since the vehicle can not be driven down to the store to
fetch more until the job is done.
