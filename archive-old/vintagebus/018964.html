Subject: VERY serious 67 Westy SO44 FS
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Admittedly, I blather on too much BUT...

With no appologies I want to mention that there is a
genuine **KILLER** '67 SO44 Poptop Westy FS on Ebay.
If and only if, it is the same bus that I think it is
then it is hands down like buying off of the show room
floor. Have seen this bus in person and it it so
original that it would curl your hair. This SOB makes
me go totally off my nut. We are not talking repop
here. We are talking the real ****.
If it is the same bus that I saw at a friends house in
the Summer of '98 it is *way* beyond being able to
kick butt on the &quot;resto&quot; 67 Westy that I did for my
wife. This is at least in the order of Ross Harmons's
SO42's. If you are a lurking collector then you need
to contact the seller of this particular unit!

You can not beat original.

That Orange County guru person ought to have this in
his VW Mecca garage/museum.

Sorry to mention ebay but go that the ebay site and do
a word search for &quot;Westfalia&quot; and bid your guts out on
the westy that ends on Jan 23. If you are a serious
shopper for the ultimate '67 Pop top Westfalia you
ought to be all over this one.
I genuinely wish that I was in the market for or in
the position to nab this beast. I seriously would
trade the wife's 67SO42 RFH for it. This one should
seriously go into a museum or be pampered by someone
who really would appreciate it for what it is.
Best of luck to you...
