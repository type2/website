Hi Tacker,
Anytime you bolt on rims you need to retorque them!  That way if any dirt, 
sand, grit or even paint that might shift out of between the rim and drum and 
loosen the rim will be caught in time!  Best to always torque them to factory 
specs which for the bus is 85 Ft. Lbs..  Then recheck the torque about 2-5 
miles later.  If you are really nervous check thier torque again at 25 miles 
from when you first started out.
