&gt; they did use auto tarns in bugs.  starting in 69 it was available.  These are 
&gt; IRS, meaning a whole different axle configuration than the swing axle bus.  
&gt; Also you have a wierd oil pump that pumps stuff for the auto trans.
&gt; 
&gt; I have driven an auto trans bug a few times, but cannot say I would ever be 
&gt; tempted to do this to a bus.  However, it could be done, though it would be 
&gt; more work than a straightforward tranny swap, if you really want it 
&gt; automatic.  
If i were to autofy a split, i'd use teh type3 tranny, its FULLY
automatic, not autostick, and mounts the same as a bug tranny.

The linkage to shift would be your biggest problem. (and the conversion to
IRS, but wolfgang and bus boys et al sell kits for this)

take care,

Steve
