Subject: still won't start, bad wiring or coil??

Listees,

Still trying to get my 66 13 Window to start, just bought her on new years 
day.

Per Muir book, I tested the coil and it didn't spark at all, so I'm thinking 
bad coil right?

But used Volt meter on one of the terminals with the key on and didn't get 
any Volts, does this still mean a bad coil, or is the wiring to the coil 
bad.

I'm really confused and am not even positive I did the coil test 
right....any advice info would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel
