&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Or better yet run the testing proceedures on section E-2, page 14 of the
&gt; Workshop Manual Volkswagen Transporter 1963-67.  If you are having a voltage
&gt; drop this will adversely affect the headlight brightness, turn signal
&gt; brightness and flashing speed, and wiper speed, etc., etc...

A good idea.  I checked the voltate at my headlights and found it to be
12.5V with the engine running, meaning that I am losing 0.9V in the wires.
This is a reasonable drop.  I've been meaning to check the current in the
warning light wire, as I think that it gets higher as the current demand
goes up.  This would lead to the light glowing.

George Lyle
