Both had been absent for different reasons but I for one am glad to see the
return of both NQ and Ellis.  Their posts are night and day to be sure, but
I missed them both.

As far as list life you'll definately need thick skin if you are around long
enough.  It is easy to say just ignore it until the unkind words are
directed at you.  I have noticed for the most part those who forth the
attacks on other listees 1) are generally new to the list and, 2) generally
don't stay around long.  Makes it easier to deal with in some ways and
harder in others.  They definately do some damage while they are here.  I
can think of several people who used to be regulars in posting to the list
that I never read a post from anymore.  Unfortunate losses.  Perhaps there
should be some sort of social intellengence test before granting membership
to the list.  I can think of a few people who should have been dropped from
the list after their first or second post.

This list is not unlike any other large group of people.  There are several
members I really like, many I don't know, and one or two I truly dislike.
Criminals, Saints, and ordinary folk, it is the way large groups are.  One
can only hope to show up more on others list of truly liked than the truly
disliked.

I know where Ellis and NQ are on my lists.  Welcome back.

&lt;&lt; When someone tailgates me I pull to the side and slow a bit right away
and let them pass...what is it to me..go for it man.Sometimes I see them up
ahead next to me at the next light or pulled over by a cop....&gt;&gt;
