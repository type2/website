Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Gauge hook up

&gt;I hate just splicing into a wire I pull out from behind the dash, is
&gt;there a tab on the fuse box where this can be connected so that it
&gt;only gets power when the ignition switch is on.

Find your wiring diagram at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring .  For
your '71 it looks like the three rightmost fuses are all switched with
the ignition (circuit 15).  I would probably connect it to the rightmost
fuse - the one for the turn signals and some of the dash indicator
lights.  Like Joel noted, circuit 15 is all over the back of the
speedometer - it is the black wire on the generator, oil pressure,
and turn signal lights, and on the fuel gauge. 

If you don't like to splice, your FLAPS or hardware store should have
&quot;doublers&quot; that have a push-on socket with two tabs.  Put a push-on
socket on the wire to your gauge.  Then you can unplug the original
wire from a tab on some component, put the doubler on the tab, and
then plug the original wire and the gauge wire onto the doubler.

There are also splices with a slotted metal blade inside a plastic
housing.  You put two wires under the blade and squeeze it down with
pliers to make the connection and then fold a plastic tab on the
housing over the whole thing.  These work kind of OK for low-current
things but not so well for things that draw a lot of juice.  If you
remove it later, it leaves a cut in the insulation of both wires.  
I personally only use these kinds of splices for very temporary
hookups or in emergencies.

If your oil gauge has a light in it, you may want to connect the light
wire to the dash light circuit so you can dim it.  The dash light
circuit, 58b, is the gray/red stripe wire at the instrument panel
and the light switch.

Good luck!
