I've been thru this several times.  The newer seals sometimes just don't
seal well enough.  You should be using something akin to aviation permatex
on the gasket, but more than likely your leak is thru the axle seal.

YOu should also have let everything drain well before attempting assembly.
Drain the reduction box before you begin work on it.

&gt;I recently installed a new seal kit in my left reduction box to stop a minor
&gt;but significant leak.  I failed.  Why did I fail?  Should I be using
&gt;sealant?  How does the fact that oil was still dripping slowly but surely
&gt;down the sealing face of the gasket and brake plate affect things?  I did
&gt;torque the four bolts to spec per Bentley....what might I have missed?
