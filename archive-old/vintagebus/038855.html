Hello

I'M LOST NOW.

I being asking question about getting 12v out of a 6v engine, to get power
to a 12 v gas heater.
I'm be told to change the generator from 6 v to 12 v (chaning regulator to
???)
BUT NOW
I'm looking through my workshop manual '63 - '67. According to my engine
number H1029746 should this be a 12 v ???????????????????
The factory day of my engine are between July 1967 &amp; August 1967 (according
to the manual - July '67 H0760138 &amp; Aug '67 B0002333.
I haven't give it a through that it could be a 12v engine. ALL my light,
batterie &amp; radio are 6 v (the Bus' factory day is 25 feb '64).
IF there are a 12v -&gt; 6v converter installed on the bus it are mounted on
the wire after the generator, could I then have 2 wires out of the generator
(1 to the 6v batteri and 1 to (a new) 12v batterie) ???????
