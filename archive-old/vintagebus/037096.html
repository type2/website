&lt;&lt; A common topic here on the list deals with putting bigger engines
 or strange transaxle configurations in buses.  I get tons of email
 on this via my site as well.  90% of the time, these come from people 
 who just got their first bus, and are hell bent for leather to turn it
 into something they saw in the magazine.
 
 I'd like to offer the following suggestion:  if you're new to VW's, 
 or if you're new to buses, start from the ground up.  Get the basics
 of the bus working, in stock form.  Drive the bus that way for a 
 while, so you can see what it's *supposed* to be like.  Then once
 you're comfortable with your mechanical abilities and you have a 
 good baseline, then consider doing mods.
 
 I can't count the number of emails I've received from people who
 want to know how to remove the reduction boxes, because they're
 &quot;junk&quot; - even though their bus hasn't moved under it's own power
 yet!  Or the people who say the stock engine sucks because it
 doesn't have any power, and they want to put a (big engine here)
 in it, yet they never bothered to fix the original engine.  They
 have no idea of what kind of power it should have, because they're
 told by the ads in the magazines that the stock config is inferior.
 
 I'm not saying you shouldn't do any modifications - there are some really
 well-executed drivetrain mods out there, but most of them are done by
 people who actually knew what they were doing, or had very good
 coaching along the way -  I'm just saying that if you're new to VW's and/or 
 new to buses, give the stock configuration a try, if for no other reason 
 than to learn the system.  All of that stuff is there for a reason, and 
 these buses were running around for years before the armchair engineers 
 got ahold of 'em.  Learn to walk before you try to fly.
  &gt;&gt;

hear hear

in addition I'd say that I've seen people give on on projects because they 
wanted to redo everything.  It got to big.  Getting the bus drivable with the 
gear it has tends to be a better idea that spending a lot of time and dough 
building something.   Then you have the stylee split to drive, and can see 
what it does and doesn't.
