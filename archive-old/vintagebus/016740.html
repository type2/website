Subject: tail light grounding
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id MAA76793

I remember a while back someone writing in about a problem with their tail
lights. I think I have a similar problem.

Witht he lights on, when I press the rbeak the driverside tailight does not
glow as bright as it should. I remember someone wrote something about their
not being a decent ground for this light, which often caused problms. Wht I
don't remember is the suggested solutions.

Any ideas?

thanks
kevin
