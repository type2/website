I have to agree with you here.  There's no doubt the bus will be taken care
of.  Requirements for bringing an old car into service in Japan are rather
insane (replace ALL rubber every three years, absolutely zero rust, etc.) so
that's why you see a lot of the really nice ones go over there.  Saves 'em a
lot of work :-)  I once went to the website of a Japanese VW restoration
joint, they had a few splits they had done pictured, the work is truly
admirable...probably cost a fortune!

I personally can't see a difference from selling a vehicle to an overseas
enthusiast versus someone in the next town over, so long as you don't know
the guy you sell it to.  I've never seen any VW I've sold ever again, even
if the new owners live in the general area.  Sometimes they emailed
questions, but that stops soon enough.  Plus, I have no idea what became of
them afterwards...while it's a safe bet that the barndoor will be treated
like a queen!

You'll get no flames from me :-)  The Japanese have just as much a right to
enjoy a splitty that I do, IMHO.

&gt; business with these guys again.  Sure I would love to see the bus stay in
my
&gt; home town but in reality Los Angeles or Tokyo I will probably never see it
&gt; again.  As long as it is going to an enthusiast I'm okay with it...and I
&gt; don't think anyone would part with $8K on a whim, it takes an enthusiast.
