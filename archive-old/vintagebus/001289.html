Ooh, ooh!! I forgot about the Sapphire 1 radio! Now I'll have some
tunes---but they'll all have to be on the AM dial won't they? Oh well,
I've made it all this time w/out sound, and it's a good chance to
listen to the engine anyway.   AND a digital tire gauge! Funny how the
little things mean so much! :-) Oh yeah, and a new back bumper all
bare metal and ready to rust in the salt air! Any suggestions on what
to do to protect it until it gets primered? It's all wrapped in
plastic now.
So, anyway, bus and I had a _fabulous_ morning! I distributed the bus
wish list to everyone who wanted to know what I wanted! ;-)  That's
the way to do it---just don't give anyone any other options! :-)
OKAY, NOW that's all the silliness for today, but I won't promise!
Thanks for being such great bus friends to read my overexcited
ramblings! :-)
Michele
P.S. Now if someone would just exchange that rust on the bottom for
some nice new metal! Maybe for my birthday!!!!
