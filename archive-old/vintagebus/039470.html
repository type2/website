&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Some people think that if you remove the flaps then the air does not
&gt; &gt;&gt;circulate correctly over the jugs and prevents proper cooling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'll say that's horseshit until someone demonstrates it with calibrated
&gt; &gt;measurements under controlled conditions.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Then talk to VW, or search the archives for Bob Hoover's TESTING of shrouds
&gt;with and witout flaps ... the flaps direct air properly AND make a back
&gt;pressure of some kind, tho I don't know why that would be desirable.
&gt;
&gt;Wire the flaps open if you want, but at least put em in.
&gt;
&gt;Once again: WHY would VW piss away $3 of metal in EVERY motor if the money
&gt;wasn't necessary? They could easily have designed the shroud to direct air
&gt;WITHOUT the flaps and junked em; they didn't, and the shroud must work WITH
&gt;the flaps to work properly.

Well I was to leave this list and still find myself reading it.......

Anyway, I road tested a 1641 with and without the flaps about 5 years ago. 
Swap done in the same day, temperature of outside air had not varied much, 
maybe 2 degrees. With flaps I saw a 10 degree drop in oil temp. Now this is 
not a real good estimate of cooling, because oil temp is not as good as head 
temp, given that air is hitting cylinders, but after correcting for ambient 
temp of air (down 2 degrees) I would have to think that I was getting better 
airflow, and dropping temps all the way around. Like I told Clara, I would 
say a 5 to 10 degree temp drop is reasonable with flaps in.
