&gt; work as well?
Hi NQ,

The cap is for a split bus filler neck, so if you used a split bus filler
neck, you are all set... (hacked split bus neck off of split tank and mate
to bay tank with big hose)

If you used a baywindow filler neck, you'd have to go ask for a locking
cap for the year of the bus you got the tank from... I havent asked for my
71 yet, but do plan to.  I dunno why but im guessing that they dont have
it.  But i would have guessed they didnt have one for the split either...

If they do have one you are golden though, as the baywindow tank is vented
so the cap doesnt have to be...

take care,

Steve
