Subject: New '62 DC *Long*


Well folks, the CA lottery is up to 60 million tonight, but I feel I won

a small one of my own.

Today I went to look at a '62 Double Cab.  The owner informed me over
the phone that the bus was all original and very straight.  Uh
huh....right.  How many times have you gone to look at a bus that was
touted to be great only to be disappointed?  Well,  this owner was
telling the honest truth and boy I wasn't disappointed!

I first called on it on Wed.  The owner stated that he could not show it

till Sat. morning and that if I called at 8 am on Sat. he would give me
directions.  Ok, I said.  I had spent the last two days since I had
spoken with the owner worrying that by the time I went to look at it, it

would be gone.  This has happened to me in the past.  This time, I was
ready.  If the bus was good it was coming home.  Tow bar borrowed, extra

tires (bus was said to have been sitting for 7 years), tools, cover alls

and cash.

8 am came and I called.  The first ring and he picked up and said
&quot;Steve?&quot;.  He'd been expecting my call...good sign.  I jumped in the
Astro and headed out.  The truck was in Canyon Country (home of the
famed K*tch clan) and was said to have lived its entire life in the west

San Fernando Valley hauling hay on a horse ranch.  The drive was about
70 miles, and about 9:45 I arrived.  The owner was in the garage waiting

for me.  We exchanged niceties and he said &quot;lets go out back&quot;.  Sitting
out back was a very faded, very straight,  pearl white 62 DC with a
bunch of wood in the back.  As I looked it over, the owner said &quot;just
like I said right?&quot;  &quot;Right&quot; I said as  I continued to search for any
fault that I could use as a bargaining chip.  Not much at all.

I'd never seen original gates so straight.  Only a few dents on the top
edge of the rear one.  Missing two rear gate original rubber snubbers.
No rust through ANY WHERE (gates, truck or battery tray).  Only spots of

surface rust in various places.  Victim of sitting for so long out in
the rain...what little there is here in So Cal.  A perfect nose with
only about a 1/2 inch blemish on the lower part.  Never been hit any
where.  About the only bad part I could find was a small patch of bondo
just aft of the cargo door (about 4&quot; worth not bad at all), and apron
cut for pea shooters (although the extra notch is flared like the
factory one...go figure) and a dent in the front right bumper.  That is
it.  The bed has only surface rust and nary a dent in the
bed ribs.  The bolts for a tilt are there, but no tilt..not sure if
there ever
was one :-(  The body is very straight!

The inside was just as original with the exception of the ugly wood
grained formica door panels.  Headliner is original and perfect.
Rear seat is there as is the floor mat.
The front seat might be from a later one...it is a two piece adjustable
unit.  I thought someone told me that it should have a hump seat?  The
rear back rest has a hump...could that be the front one in the wrong
place?  Original radio, dash, church key and holder, pop outs on both
sides (normal??) and floor mat.

1600 DP not currently running but said to be good.  Tranny and RGBs
completely gone through before it was parked with all new bearings.
Only two of the 5 15&quot; rims are there (on the back) the front and spare
are 14's.  Front beam is very tight as are the wheel bearings. All
upgraded to 12V long ago.  All electrical working.

After I looked it over, I asked almost sheepishly if he'd take any less
than the asking price.  &quot;No&quot; is all he replied.  &quot;OK&quot; I said...&quot;I didn't

think so.&quot;  &quot;I'll take it then&quot;.   He paused.  &quot;Well, I guess I can tell

you this now&quot;.   &quot;What&quot; I replied.   &quot;Some guy called me late last night

and insisted he come over and look at the truck&quot;. &quot;Really?&quot; I replied.
&quot;yeah...said his name was Bob Katch or something&quot;  &quot;you mean Bob
Kotch??&quot;  &quot;Yeah...thats it. I told him to bring his own lights.  He
looked at it for about 5 minutes and said &quot;I'll take it&quot; He got  bent
when I told him I had promised another person who called before him (me)

first right of refusal.  He then said he would beat what ever the offer
was&quot;.  I was shocked.  Finally I'd met an ethical seller!  He actually
kept his promise to me and then sold it to me at his original asking
price!

We then exchanged the money and the paper work and for the next three
hours we BS'ed  while I replaced two front flats and pulled the rear
wheels to check the RGBs for tranny fluid (thanks for the tip Thom!),
and hooked up the tow bar (thanks Matthew H.).  All through that time I
almost felt like I was taking his child.  He kept saying &quot;I'm glad its
going to you...you'll take good care of it&quot;.  I backed up the van into
the yard and hooked up the bar and pulled it around front.  He called me

over and said for me to wait a minute.  He went inside and brought out a

few old HVWs and a model of a stream liner he designed.  In the 80's he
was big into Bonniville racers.  The team he was on went 218mph with a
rabbit motored streamliner.  We talked for more than an hour more.
Great VW guy...nice to know they are out there. During the conversation,

he said that one of his friends was getting out of the hobby and had a
big parts stash.  Of course I asked if he had any of the good stuff, and

to my amazement he said he was sure he had a original set of safari's.
&quot;Cool&quot; I said.  &quot;Let me know if he wants to sell&quot;.  He said he would,
and we left it at that.  We shook hands and said our good byes.

I pulled away with a mixture of sadness and elation at my new prize.
After two low front tires, a stop at kragen for some fix-a -flat and a
white knuckle 55 mph ride down the 5 fwy to OC I made it home safe and
sound.

As someone on this list has said, &quot;there are still good ones out
there...just be patient and never stop looking!&quot;.  I agree.  I just
happened to pick up a penny saver like we all do and was lucky to see
it.  In all the excitement, I forgot to get my lotto ticket.  Oh well, I

think I've exhausted all the luck I've got today anyway.  60 million
would have been nice too though ;-)

Oh, almost forgot.  Here are the pictures!
