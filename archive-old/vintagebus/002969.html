Subject: Re: [VB] truck bed

&gt; I need a small section of a truck bed to use as a template to straighten
&gt; my bed out. Its a 57 single in overall good shape (now that most of the
&gt; bodywork is
&gt; done!) but the bed has just has a few bad spots that need to be evened
&gt; out. Its been beadblasted and zinc coated and there was no rust really to
&gt; start with, just the usual rot under the gates (which is a whole other
matter
&gt; ). I am going to remove the lower panels, so getting at the bed from below
&gt; will be easy. So removing the lower section will be my next project. But
in
&gt; the meantime I need to find a couple of solid 2ft by 2ft section (approx)
&gt; does not need to be pretty just straight. Can anyone help me out?
&gt; Has anyone tried this?

I have a '65 DC with worse bed problems than yours. My bed was rusted-out
completely from the cab back about 2 feet. The top hat under that section
was rusted-out as well. I'm faced with the unpleasant task of locating a
good used section of bed to replace my bad piece.

 I cut out that section and I have a section that is 2x2 that you might be
able to use. I don't know if the pattern is the same as yours though.

Why do you need to get &quot;under&quot; the bed to straighten it? Are the top hats
damaged on yours? Why can't you just make a pattern using the good sections
of your own bed to use as a template for repair of the bad section?
