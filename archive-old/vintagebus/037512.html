  Now that would be an acomplishment. Best use of the list yet. We could have 
some Brekina Busses made to match the Bus and sell them. Profits to help pay 
for some of the costs. Everyone that buys stock in the Bus could buy an HO 
scale version of it to ease the withdrawl until the Bus comes around again.
