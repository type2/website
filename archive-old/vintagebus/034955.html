&lt;&lt; Can we fill from center only or do we have to fill each RGB seperately?
 The bus is on a hoist so the wheels are hanging down. &gt;&gt;
Hi Philip &amp; Catherine,
Do yourself a big favor, and fill the RGBs first!  You can fill them by 
filling the center section.  It just takes three or four times as long.  You 
end up having to fill the center section over and over until the oil makes 
it's way down into the RGBs, and then finish filling the center section.  
Warming the oil before filling for either method is a good idea.  Drop the 
oil bottle in a bucket of hot water, and let it soak for about half and hour.
