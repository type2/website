In light of the recent postings on bondo removal, I have a question.  Does
the list feel that bondo type body fillers should not be used at all or just
used at a minimum.  I agree that bondo, in general, was and is abused.
However, I don't see any major disadvantages to applying thin coats here or
there to smooth out slight imperfections.

Just wondering...
