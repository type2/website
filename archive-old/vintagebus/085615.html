Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS REQUST - Harrisburg PA Ignition Issues

Just heard from Jamie, they are safe and sound.

Tom Hughes from PA  is on his way with spare parts to get him up and running.

He thanks all who responded with support!

  Hi Volks,

  Jamie Auch is stuck on Rt 15 Just North of Harrisburg PA. He's a
  stone's throw from the intersection with 850 West.
