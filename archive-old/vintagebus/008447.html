Well....my situation involves the fact that if I am to get another VW, I
have to get rid of my 280Z in the process....basically a daily driver for
another.  If we think that the dc could be made to drive to my home from
Oregon (I'm in Northern Bay Area, CA), and then to get me around while I
finish the Kombi in my garage, there's a possibility that I could make it
happen without causing Michele to commit me....  : )

Knowing where exactly this beastie lives, and whether the running gear
functions at all would probably help.  I'm feeling vulnerable to peer
pressure, but I also do not want to jeopardize the possibility of getting a
'66 Deluxe walkthrough (in need of tlc, of course) for relatively cheap.
The owner doesn't know yet if he wants to sell....

&gt; I've taken worse and made it look better.
&gt;
&gt; I don't recall ifthe rear seat stuff was there or no.  It looks like
&gt; it has fridge-style handles, which makes it early 63.
&gt;
&gt; Compared to some of the bus welding I've done, rockers are a cake-walk.
&gt;
&gt; It has all the gates, the DC side gates are worth the bid price in and
&gt; of themselves!
&gt;
&gt; Motor?  A motor is EASY to get.
