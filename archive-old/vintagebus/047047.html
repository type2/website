Well on that note.....
I guess I better lower the price on the roof rack I offerd to thom fitz!
Id have to sell it to him for 50$ to match the manufacturing costs!
Hey thom....
Ill make you the same offer I made everett.
You can use mine as a copy to have another one fabricated if you wish.

Well I'll tell you all this much.  When the cost to buy, exceeds the cost to
build or make your own, then the price is too damn high!  Think how many
side steps you could have made for that much with a little creative welding
or fabricating...
