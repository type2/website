&lt;&lt; I have a couple questions for you.  First, why do you recommend only the 
German Fuel line with the cloth outer covering.  Isn't the rubber stuff 
basically the
 same.&gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Rubber is never basicly the same!  There are so many types of rubber and ways 
some manufactures stretch thier expensive materials by mixing in cheap 
filler!  Such as clay!  Take body rubber EDM is the best and resists UV-rays 
very well and last ten years or more without cracking.  On the otherhand 
cheap rubber often from the far East with it's filler materials will tend to 
crack badly in 6-12 months!
  The German fuel line with it's cloth covering is easily identifiable.  The 
non-name rubber fuel line at your FLAPS is not.  Where did it come from?  Who 
knows!  The cloth covering on the German fuel line actually helps to protects 
the rubber from hardening/cracking due to engine oil and ozone from the 
generator.  The same thing happens to the engine wiring harness.  The wires 
exposed to the engine atmosphere have thier insulation harden and crack 
easily after about five to ten years.  The engine wires inside the plastic 
sheeth of the wiring harness on the other hand stay like new!  So the ends of 
the German fuel line show thier aging at the exposed ends by cracking before 
the rest of the fuel line gets dangerously brittle.

&lt;&lt;Second question is, do you guys have a web-site.  I was at a friends house
 the other day and they were looking at some camper stuff, and your names 
were on
 the site I think.  I don't know I thought it referenced you guys some how. &gt;&gt;
Not yet!  We want to do a web sight and have been trying to figure out how.  
We have been supplying some volks with images and that is probably the 
referance you mention.   Eric&amp;Barb
