Just wanted to find out if a 70 middle seat will line up with the hold-downs

in my 67.  Found a guy selling one for $75.  Will it fit?  Is $75 too much?

it will fit.  Sounds kinda pricey though.    If anyone is interested in the
Puget Sound area, I have a few bay middle seats I'm using as carport
