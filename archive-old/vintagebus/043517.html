&gt;Any ideas here?  I just hooked up all the electrical in my bus.  (65
&gt;deluxe micro that i have been restoring)  I am 100% certain that all the
&gt;wires are installed right.  The problem is with the turn signal light in
&gt;the speedo.  It is alway's on untill i turn the turn sig's on.  Then it
&gt;blinks.  I have checked the voltage at the relay and the lug is alway's
&gt;supplying +12v.  Even if the key is off.  That makes the light alway's
&gt;on since the dash pod is grounded.  (This is a new 3 prong relay)

The turn signal indicator in the speedometer works by having one side
*powered* (not grounded) by the hot-with-key-on wire, #15, and having
the other side *grounded* by the turn signal relay.  Like the following -
B+ is battery voltage, whether 6 or 12 volts:

                    Indicator bulb
Key  Signals    connections      Result
off  off        none  B+         off
off  on         none  B+/ground  off
on   off        B+    B+         off
on   on         B+    B+/ground  flashing 

Since one side of your turn signal bulb is grounded, it is normal
for it to light up with the +12v present at the flasher.  It doesn't
load the flasher enough to make it start, though.

If the problem is what I think it is, the red and green (generator
and oil) lights in your speedo won't work either.  There are six
bulbs in your speedo.  Three of them should be grounded to the
speedo case: the two illumination bulbs and the high-beam indicator
bulb.  Three of them should be connected to #15 from the ignition
switch: the turn signal indicator bulb and the red and green bulbs.
Probably the easiest check for this is to pull the wire off the
oil pressure sender at the engine and ground it well to the block,
then go up front and turn the key on.  If the green light doesn't
come on, you probably don't have #15 hooked up right at the 
speedometer.

Good luck!
