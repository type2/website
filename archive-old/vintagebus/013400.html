Subject: Re: Re: (Friday) Any bus stuff in History Channel VW program?
Message-Id: &lt;199907050547071_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

the VW program that the History Channel made.  One
striking piece of video shows dozens of barndoor buses (and nothing
else) being driven around a circle.

Where can I get a copy of this?  I don't have cable.  (I know, everyone has cable, but hey, I drive a bus, own a house older than I am, and vaccuum with a 1950's Kirby.  That new fangled stuff scares me.  I will need that copy on Beta (just kidding).)
