Michael,
Try going to your local VW dealership.  I had an original set of blank
keys cut for my bus there.  Just avert your eyes from the new bastard
children of VW and head straight for the parts dept in the back.  They
should have a book with all the codes and a template jig for VW keys.
All you need to do is give them your code from your key/lock cylinder.
I was lucky cause they actually used a key cutter and not the dreaded
key grinder.  And yes there is a difference.  An original cut key is
always smooth on the teeth and a ground key has grooves on the teeth.
Ground keys suck! cause they act like a file on you tumblers.  Hmm...
maybe that's why most VWs locks don't work anymore?! Just a thought.

Good cutting, and I hope this &quot;unlocked some secrets&quot;.  Uh-chuck,
Uh-chuck. :-)
