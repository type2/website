I'm probably thinking of a different pressed section than you.
The jackpoints I've seen have been two different styles, Pre-65, and 66-67.

&lt;&lt;I could be wrong but i think Neil's 58 and Kent's 56 both had the pressed

places in them, to note Neil opted to use the repop WW jackpoints , verses

mine for that simple reason that the looked more like orginal.. Neil should

chime in on this and call for sure he's the vintage guru , i'm just a

flunky,,,,,grin
