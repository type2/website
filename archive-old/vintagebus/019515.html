Actually, people sell stuff they don't own all the time, even on ebay.
They know of something person A is selling, think they can get more
from person B on ebay, and if they do, they buy from A and flip it to B.
If person C buys the item off-ebay before the can sell to B, he simply 
hides behind a &quot;broker&quot; facade and claims person A backed out of the
deal.  There was a discussion of this just a couple days ago on the 911
list, although the individual involved was doing so much of it that
ebay pulled his card.
