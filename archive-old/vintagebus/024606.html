why not just use a full length z-seat - i found one here in winnipeg, canada - for

$75.00 - that's probably about $48.00 US - the upholstery is excellent - but needs
to be changed to match my bus- it's great - it came out of a later loaf but it
bolted right in
with the bolt-clamp-thingys that held the original seat in - and i now have a
storage place to pile tools etc. in -  im really happy - my aim is to keep my bus
as stock as possible but for the z-seat - and since i have the original seat - i
can change em back in probably less than 1/2 hour - i could have bought the whole
70's westy interior for my 60 standard for a great deal - but my feeling is the my
bus is much more versatile with out the cabinets etc..

tho - next year i think ill go back and see the guy for one of his gas heaters :)
