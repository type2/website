You customize 2 dozen other barndoor dashes... or glue them all over other people's buses at christmas time.

I may take some if my pod is in need.

&gt;&gt; I would love to find original replacements, but what I have used in the
past with good luck is a couple of layers of plastic from the page divider
tabs from a notebook.
&gt;&gt;
I was at Michael's today (Art's and Crafts store) looking for the same
thing.  Found some little plastic crystals in all different diameters.
Chose a variety pack ($2) with the red, green, and blue I needed in 6.5 mm
diameter for my Barndoor dash.  Went home, sanded them down with 600 and 500
grit so they were less diamond shaped and more flat, super glued them in,
snazzy!

Colors are not a perfect match with my Single Cab original dash but it's
better than the nothing I had before.

Now what do I do with the other 50 little crystals left over, maybe a
dazzling shirt for the Classic?!?  :)
