I recently picked up a 67 Westy that I was told had a
1776, and am having some trouble figuring out exactly
what the motor is. The ID number has the VW (apologies
to VWOA for infringing) logo followed by the letter H,
a 5, and then six more numbers. According to the type2
library, H is a 1965 Type 2 1500. H5 is a 1968-69 Type
1 1500. The intake is dual port and I didn't think
that dual ports were made that early. The motor also
has an oil filter on it, is this an add on? It also
has an alternator, and absent a voltage regulator, I
presume it has an internal one. The carb is not one
I've had on previous VWs, it has a square K&amp;N type air
cleaner on it and has &quot;Made in Spain&quot; cast on it. 

Any ideas on what this is so I can get it tuned up and
ready for a trip to Mt. Ranier would be appreciated.

Thanks
