Subject: '59 Kombi....misc. stuff

Well today I set out to fix my emergency brake and to do some clutch 
stuff to see if it'd fix my grinding second gear.

I've got a '59 Kombi with a big nut tranny in the back. I was missing 
emergency brake cable on one side and the other side had a broken 
one. So I went the cheaper &quot;less safe&quot; route and ordered 2 big nut 
cables and some of those EMPI emergency brake cable shortner ends 
that the buggy guys use. (So that's why I was asking about cutting 
the cable). When I got into the first rear wheel, I found it had the 
emergency brake lever parts not installed correctly and one of the 
brake springs was not correct. The other wheel was missing one of the 
emergency brake lever parts and one of the brake pads was worn. So I 
headed out to the barn and grabbed and handfull of old brake parts. I 
replaced everything that was missing or wrong, substituted a good 
brake shoe/pad for the one bad one, cleaned everything up real good, 
installed my cables and put it all back together. Up in front of the 
bus, I shortened my cable using a number of hand tools and installed 
the EMPI ends. It worked real well. I feel comfertable with the 
solution I used. I'm sure a few folks will have something to say. But 
it's good for me. The cost was just over $30 for both cables and the 
EMPI ends. I'll keep an eye on the set-up and see how it does.

Next, I went to adjust the free play in my clutch. The wing nut was 
frozen and wouldn't move one bit either direction. I tried using 
plyers and pushing with a screw driver and a few other things. No 
luck. So I  grabbed my big 36 MM socket and wrench and was able to 
get it onto the wing nut in a way that I could get some leverage and 
get it to work loose. I cleaned up the threads and the wing nut real 
good and put it back in. Set up the clutch pedal.

I also grabbed a replacement screw that bolts the spring plate to the 
redux gear box. My bus was missing one on one side. Interesting thing 
was that the ones on my bus have 19mm heads and the ones on the bus 
outside had 17mm heads. It fit fine though.

I then checked the gear oil in the redux boxes. Both were good. So I 
checked the tranny. It was low. It took over 3/4 of a quart to fill 
it up! I know when I originally changed the fluid months ago, I 
didn't do it properly. I didn't change or check the redux gear boxes 
at that time. BUT I've had fluid leak out onto my wheels as well. 
It's been months. But it's something I'm gonna have to keep an eye on.

After this day of work I just fired up the bus and took it for a 
spin. WOW. Brakes work a lot better. Emergency brakes work great too. 
AND NO GRINDING IN 2nd!!! Man, all I could think was how smooth and 
quiet the tranny was. I guess having oil in there makes a 
difference!!!! Oh well. Something else to watch out for.

The bus runs, feels, and sounds great right now. I'm may still make 
some adjustments to the clutch pedal. But it all is tons better.

Any suggestions on how to isolate where the gear oil is leaking from 
would be great.

Thanks for listening.
