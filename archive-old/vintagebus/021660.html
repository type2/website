To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have considered mounting an external cooler to my bus before but didnt want 
the thing hanging off the side of the bus. I thought about maybe putting it 
underneath the bus with a little scoop to pull air up and a plate underneath 
to keep it from getting bashed to much. Any thoughts on this idea?
