Subject: [VB] Steering Question - Wheels .. 2 ?'s

&gt; 1)  Boyfriend was driving behind me and said the tires look VERY
EXAGGERATED,
&gt; the way they point in in the back.  How much is TOO MUCH ???

Too much is too much.
Yours is fine, it's a &quot;swing-axle&quot; ( as described in your Idiot book :)

&gt; 2)  Turning.  U-turns.  When I make a tight right the wheel turns fine,
feels
&gt; normal.  But when I turn hard left .. the wheel is turning and then seems
to
&gt; stop hard with less of a turn.  I have yet to turn the wheel to the right
&gt; where is just can't turn any further ... is this normal ?? Left U turns
are
&gt; next to impossible  .. or have to be VERY wide U-turns.

Not good. Your steering needs adjustment.
Whoever adjusted the steering wheel to center it
needs to borrow the Idiot book after you finish it.
Drive ahead slowly so you know when the steering is straight.
Stop without turning the steering wheel. Then slowly turn
the steering wheel and count the &quot;o'clocks&quot; to left lock, then to right.
They will not be the same, and that is wrong.
The adjustments are in the tie-rods and drag link.
