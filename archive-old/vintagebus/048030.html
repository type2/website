Hi John,
To install a sunroof you really should start with either a sun roof bus or a
double door panel van.  Both of these VWs have the secondary reinforcement
floors to stiffen the chassi.  Any other type of VW bus will just flex to
death.  We are going to replace the roof on one of our buses due to foam
rubber insulation caused rust in the roof.  The job is large but not all that
hard by the look of it.
