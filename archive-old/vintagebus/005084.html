Subject: Re: Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

Today I turned the drums. Everything is back to normal, and the ride is much
better on these tires. The only bastard was getting the left rear wheel nut
off.

I still do not know about the balancing. No one in town can do it. Will call
around and see if I can find a place that offers the service on the car as
someone suggested.

I have not talked to the owner of the tire place yet. I want to see if they
are balanced correctly before I inform him of the problem. This is a VERY
small town and will need him in the future, and he also is a client at my
business. It was his employee that messed up and I am sure he will not do it
again when the owner finds out.

Thanks again,

&gt; First, thanks for all the replies. I had 10 within 4 hours. Most said
don't
&gt; burn it, one guy offered me matches.
&gt;
&gt; I feel like an idiot. I told the guy last week that I wanted to put the
&gt; wheels on myself because I knew they would be too tight, but I was late
&gt; getting back to work and needed to get out of there. I had no idea they
&gt; could warp the drums! Damn.
&gt;
&gt; I took all four wheels off. Over torqued? On two wheels it took a 24 inch
&gt; breaker bar and a 18 inch pipe extension to get the lugs off! Damn.
&gt;
&gt; I re-torqued the lugs to 94 ftlb per Bentley, set the tire pressure at 30
&gt; front and 40 rear (my tools and camping gear are in there), and adjusted
the
&gt; brakes. First test drive to test it showed a 50% reduction of the
pulsating.
&gt; I'll call around to see who has the correct balancing machine before I
have
&gt; the drums turned. Strange thing is that this same shop put the old tires
on
&gt; and the new guy asked me how they balanced them last time, like I would
&gt; remember!
