&gt; OTOH - do we have proof that these cars actually *left*?  That would
&gt; be THE scam!  Maybe there's a huge warehouse in SoCal with all these
&gt; buses that supposedly went to Japan.  They could &quot;bring them back&quot;
&gt; onesy-twosey and make a killing and saving on the shipping costs!

Does anyone remember when people would sell all the &quot;good stuff&quot; to the Japanese
at Pomona, VW Classic, etc. because they would pay *any* price???

Look what happened, all of a sudden Flat 4 (same Japanese folks that were buying)
reproduced almost all of what they were gouged on, and they are the ones now
laughing. The huge warehouse in SoCal Thom speaks of reminds me of Namo's place
in Santa Monica (Flat 4 here without all the signs) I remember when Flat 4 came
out with the &quot;Golden Lady&quot; horn button for $89 There were  people at the Toy Show
near LAX losing their minds because they couldn't get the $600 for their
originals that the Japanese *used* to pay. Flat 4 &quot;Empi&quot; steering wheels and
BRM's did the same thing.

It all comes around. Type 3's were hot for awhile, now Buses, before that it was
Porsches. Impalas and any other &quot;lowrider&quot; have never stopped being &quot;sought
after&quot; I happen to know of a guy willing to pay BIG BUCKS for automatic '68 and
'69 Squarebacks. Am I going to ignore that because I know they'll go to Japan?
Hell no!! I'm buying them for $300 and selling them for $3000 so I can finish my
own cars.

It's only metal and rubber were talking about here people. In the long run, in
the end. Will it really matter who bought what from who or who sold what where?
No it won't. Enjoy the opportunity while you have while you can still enjoy it.
