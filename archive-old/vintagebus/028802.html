Subject: Engine update, Kidz in town

Hello Friends,

I wound up banging in the middle 8 inches or so of the rear of my new
tank to make it fit. I didn't really want to hafta do that, but once I
got started, it wasn't so bad, and the tank sat right down on the shelf,
just like its supposed to...

Got the new engine in, cranked it right up, and started fiddling with
the adjustments on the carbs. Revved the engine up a few times, and
after a few minutes, it started revving down and died... Hmmm. Tried to
crank it back up, and it spun over really fast, like it had no
compression. What the heck is going on?...

Ran compression on cylinders 1, 2, and 3 and got zero... I got
suspicious, and balanced a roll of electrical tape on top of my
generator pulley, and spun it over again. When I got back behind the
bus, my roll of tape was still sitting on top of my pulley... Engine is
not turning!

Pulled the engine back out. I spun the flywheel around by hand, but the
rest of the engine wasn't turning.... Pulled the flywheel and discovered
that the dowel pins were sheared off... Geez. The engine wasn't locked
up, though.

I got another flywheel from work, along with another gland nut, shims of
different sizes, new seal and o-ring. Oh, yeah, and one of those shiny
billet oil filler necks...

I'm about to install the new flywheel, set the endplay (with one of
those feeler gauge things), re-install the engine, then get back to
adjusting those Kadrons. I've gotten a lot of good advice from the list
(thank you!). Hopefully the new engine bearings weren't damaged while
running without the flywheel firmly attached...

My two kids came up to visit me for a couple of days, in my daughter's
pimped out '72 Super Beetle, so we will be doing some work on lil Dave's
'67 13 window deluxe... Keep ya posted...

david
