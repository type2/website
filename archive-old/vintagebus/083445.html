Subject: Re: [VB] Stock muffer on 1776?

So would you recommend an S&amp;S muffler?
The one I have on the bus right now is a screamer. I have 2 layers of JCW
heat shield all over the interior as well as 1 layer on the floor covered
with 1/8&quot; of rubber for a sound barrier. The paneling has not yet been
installed and the noise in the cab is huge on the freeway. No way to hear
the radio, and I have turned it up. Its almost all engine exhaust noise.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt; I always got at least 5 years out of a Thunderbird System, maybe two
&gt; or three out of a S&amp;S, all in So California.
&gt; 
&gt; S&amp;S in Phoenix, AZ still makes their product, and the quality is
&gt; marginally acceptable (They make a nice system for the Vanagon
&gt; Wasserboxer, but there are still reports of the muffler's lack of
&gt; longevity and quality still circulating around).
