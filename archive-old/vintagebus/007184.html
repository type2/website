&gt; Can the engine still have some
&gt; internal problem so that a high torque electric motor, which is
&gt; supposed to turn it many, many times faster, cannot turn it over
&gt; at all (or only very slowly)?

Without the help of firing cylinders, the engine may turn quite slowly. When
the cylinders are hitting it is helping it turn. If your ignition has been
moved out of time, it can work against the starter. Check all timing and
ignition areas carefully. Has the distributor been moved, has someone put
the plug wires back to the correct position because they weren't like in the
manuals, etc? Maybe your distributor is 90 or 180 out and the plugs aren't
firing at the right time.

&gt; Yes, the starter seemed to have burned out from this ordeal. I
&gt; took it back out of the car (a bear to do with the engine in--I
&gt; had to remove the right rear brake line), and hooked it up to a
&gt; 6V source. The gear pops out, but it doesn't turn anymore!
&gt;
&gt; Incidently, when trying to get the starter to turn, a voltmeter
&gt; hooked between the + and - battery terminals would read 6V. When
&gt; the starter was turned on (but wasn't working), this dropped to
&gt; next to nothing.  A guy in a electrical shop told me this
&gt; indicates the starter is bad.

If you are saying that you attempted to operate the starter without it being
mounted in a tranny, you would expect it to show zero. In all but the self
supporting starters, this will cause the armature to ground out in the
starter and in all likelihood will let all of the magic smoke out of it.
Chances are good that this starter is NLPR (no longer playing records), has
assumed room temperature, is taking the big dirt nap, has gone paws up, etc.
In other words, deceased I say. Once you have obtained a replacement starter
and installed it into the appropriate orifice, you may proceed to once again
troubleshoot your ignition and fuel systems. Try spilling a little fuel into
the carb or a spritz of carb cleaner while cranking to see if it hits. If
so, you may be looking for a fuel problem or vacuum leak. Follow the
procedures exactly from the idiot book for static timing and see if your
timing is way off. Check for spark from the coil, then from the plug wires.
Pull the plugs and make sure they aren't fouled. Check that they are in the
correct orientation. Has anyone moved plug wires recently? You positive?
Step by step.
