&gt; My PO told me that he had removed the RGBs from my 58 bus.  Not true.  

Are you sure? he might have put them back in :)

&gt; They are still there.  What are the pros and cons to having them?
&gt; How much of a pain is it to remove them?

Pro. you get a faster wheel speed since the final output of the
transaxle isn't being reduced. but less torque at that wheel.

pro/con depending on what you like, it lowers the bus for that slammed
look. 

con. I like torque.

pro/con w/ some kits you can actually use an irs kit and get rid of the
RGB and go w/ some of the later transmissions. 

not my con, but I love this one:
I was chit-chatting w/ a vw guy recently displaced from Cal to here in
TN. we were looking at my bus and talking RGB's. He stated that he
hated the darn things. I asked him why. One problem was that it
limited speed since those boxes were only designed to turn so fast
(this I can believe). The other problem that I sure didn't agree with
is he complained that if on the road a RGB went out they weren't
readily available. Yea, and a swing axle tranny are just laying around
on the road for the picking. RGB's are solid things. w/ proper upkeep
they won't die any more than any other major component on the bus.
