Sorry to post to the list on this one...trying to respond to Gerald
about my side gate loops....my response was returned to me!
Undeliverable mail.
    I wanted to say thank you for offering, but someone else maybe has
NOS loops. I'll wait to see if he can find 'em before I ask you to try
to get one off of your gate. Can you e-mail me again so I can try to get
a message thru to you?
