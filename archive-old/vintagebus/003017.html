&gt;Ambulance Side Step     Sep. 30, 1999 Price:       $800.00
&gt;Early Ambulance side step. OK Condition. Call 8am-3pm or weekends. Or


Well I'll tell you all this much.  When the cost to buy, exceeds the cost to
build or make your own, then the price is too damn high!  Think how many
side steps you could have made for that much with a little creative welding
or fabricating...
