Subject: 67 Progress!

Well ,
    Today I made pretty good progress....I went back to the Bow Wow store in
Boise and returned the links that I had bought, and bought the whole
assemblies. That was when I learned that the right side was fixed, so my
link I had bought was not going to work anyway. So, got home, looked under
there, and sure enough...the right side is all non adjustable. My 13 year
old son ( Josh) came out and wanted to help, so I fired up the torch and we
popped the right side tie rod off and bolted on the new ones. Sweet, looks
nice, and no more wobbles! I'll have to check the drag link though....didn't
even know there was one there. Let's see.....then we pulled the brake rotors
off....the brake pads looked like new ones, so I will just keep the box of
news ones as spares. Pulled the pads off, removed the old brakes hoses, then
replaced the little actuators. They got me again!!! sent me back with three
front brake cylinders, and one rear brake  one!! dang it!! I really need to
check that stuff before I leave the store!! So , the passenger side got two
new ones, and the drivers side one new one for now. Cleaned it up, put it
back together, bled the brakes....wow the pedal feels alot better. the first
problem that I noticed was that the axle on the drivers side looked like the
outer bearing has worn a small groove. That's not supposed to be there is
it? I can't remember seeing one on the passenger side. There's no wobble,
and it turns smoothly, so I'm not going to worry about it to much right now.
Put the new speedo cable in....what a booger that was......had to pull out
the rubber seal that it goes through, slide it on the cable, and then put in
through. then i had to pull it all out again, and start from inside the bus.
Took me an hour to get it fished through the hole in the floor. Spun the
wheel, it looked like it is working!! Yay. Put the parcel tray in , and got
it bolted in. That tightened up the steering wheel. Much better!....Got the
front wheels and new tires on. Moved to the back. Jacked up the back, took
the wheels off, sent them with the wife to one tire store who will dismount
them for free, and then she went to the other tire store for the new tires.
They were closed for the day!!! Darn it! Now I can't take it for a test
drive until Monday....what a bummer!! Oh well, need to install the new
shocks on the rear. Passenger side, went on ...no problem. the shocks that
were on there...man were thay shot. Just extra weight! Moved to the drivers
side rear....( Second Problem ) that shock that came off, was the worst of
them all...._dot_complely gone, loose....yuck!! Installed the new one lower
part, went to install the upper mount....shock holes won't line up.....what
the !_at_#$%^&amp;* oh criminy!!! The shock mount on the frame rail, is torn from
the rail along the bottom and all bent up about an inch or so I'd
guess.....Oh brother. Not sure how i'm going to fix that.....Probly have to
trailer it to a body shop and get it fixed....How will they do that? It
looks to me like they can maybe beat this one back into position, and then
re-weld it. I don't know. I'm not much of a welder, and my little welder
might not be able to handle this job anyway. Well, I got a lot done
today....it was only 99 degrees here, so I'm toasted! must have been out
there for 8 hours at least! But....Gooner ( the Bus ) he's getting
happier...I can tell!! Man  I hope I'm not violating any rules with the long
posts.....Nice to talk to people who understand us and what and why we do
this! Well, maybe I'll pull the motor tomorrow, and get the oil pump
straightened out, and the oe style muffler on. New clutch cable, and clutch
disc.....I'll keep you posted!! Good Night,
Jason
