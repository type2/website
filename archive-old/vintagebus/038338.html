I also like to keep up with traffic.

The 912 E engine is the same as the late 914 2.0L except for a different
fuel injection.  The FI on the 912 E is better in my opinion than the 914
but neither would be easy to fit in a bus.  Otherwise the engines are
identical.  The only difference between the 914 engine and the bus engine is
the dipstick location and slightly different heads.  The late bus engine
also has hydraulic lifters.

I have a 67 westy that I put an upright converted 912 2.0L engine in.  It is
carbureted as making the stock FI fit with an upright shroud would require a
ton of fabrication.  I was able to do this without any modification to the
engine compartment of the bus.  I am happy with the conversion but it is
probably the last I will do.  It was a lot of work for a little more power
and still having webers to deal with.  If someone comes out with a kit to
fit the stock bus FI on an upright conversion I think it would be worth it.

In all of the different engine setups I have put into buses my favorite is
still a single port 1600 with kadrons.  Great power up to 70 and cheap!

here are a couple of pictures of what I am describing

To all non-vintage nazis,
I have been thinking of an engine swap for my 67 Westy to make freeway
driving less challenging. I have a 1600 DP that is running fine but I need
to
rev to 4200-4500 to keep up with traffic. I know this is not great for
longevity, even with a dog house, and synthetic oil. Temps stay under 225. A
trans swap to IRS and longer gears is planned &quot;sometime.&quot;

I have looked at the hot rod Type 1 rebuilds, over bore to 1835+, or perhaps
a stroker crank shaft or what ever. $2,500+ for a motor that is still
revving
way more that it was designed for. A Type 4 swap with the Joe Cali changes
has the power and rev-ablity, but also $2,800++. Advantage is that it has
been done and Joe wrote a good book to tell you how.

I note that 2.4 L 911 motors with 5 speed trannys are now becoming available
at about $2,000+/- in good used condition. Good revs (6,500+), good HP, okay
torque, but a lot of work to swap into a split window. The package is too
long to fit. Either the engine cover grows a &quot;power bulge&quot; or the trans and
torsion bars moves forward, or both.

Has anyone heard of or seen a Porsche 912E motor dropped into a split
window?
I have the opportunity to buy a 912E motor complete with all FI parts,
engine
tin, and rear engine support bar, heater boxes, etc.,  for $1,500 in good
used rebuilt shape.
It is basically a 2L Type 4 motor with a Porsche factory conversion to an
upright fan, fuel injection with a mass air flow sensor (good stuff) and
about 95 HP at about 6,000 rpm, great torque at about 4,000 rpm.

It should be less than half the work of installing the 911 motor (no dry
sump
oil tank, about the same length as the Type 1 motor, etc.) with more power,
torque and rpm capability to handle modern freeways.
My question. Has anybody done this before?? I am looking for info on the how
to address the problems of making this swap work. I know it is not &quot;correct&quot;
or &quot;factory,&quot; but it is my bus dammit. It is almost a daily driver and I
like
to tinker. No flames please.
