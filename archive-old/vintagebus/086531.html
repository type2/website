I can't remember if you had an answer to this yet or not, but this
number is somewhat consistent with a 1965 Bug engine, produced some time
in the second half of 1964.  Buses got the 1500 as standard before the
1200/40 hp engine numbers got this high.  If you assume somewhat linear
production rates, you can interpolate to mid-November, 1964.  This is
according to the engine and chassis numbers in Muir; I don't have
another reference for Bug numbers.  Also remember that the engine number
describes what the engine was when it came off the line 40+ years ago;
any number of rebuilds could have changed it since then.
