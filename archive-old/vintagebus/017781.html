my dad has a bernie bergman motor in his '68
squareback, since '98. a couple of months after it
went in, a valve spring broke. dad was highly
angered(to put it politely). bernie was very
appologetic, replaced the spring free, and mentioned
he had been stung by a bad batch of springs. he builds
a lot of motors and would go through stock pretty
quick. how many bad springs are still on shelves?
