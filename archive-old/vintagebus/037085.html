Subject: E brake cables
Message-ID: &lt;8edf80d8.24bf8aa0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

the PO of out 65 decided to cut the e brake cables at the rear and we need to 
get them replaced.    Cant roll off the side of the mountain in Jerome.  
Someone told me E Brake cables werent readily available and that I should get 
a move on looking for them.   Now I know I could get on the phone or look at 
some web pages, but does anyone know anywhere that sells them?  

Also, we have a 67 tranny in the garage with E brake cables attached.  would 
it be easiest to just use those or is it better to get them new?

any help appreciated

Matt
