&gt; drygas I guess it somehow grabs the water in the fuel and gets it out ofyour
&gt; system. not sure how it works, but it works for me.

Hi Kevin,
Drygas is just wood alcohal.  Water and gasolene do not mix and quickly 
seperate after mixing just like oil and water salad dressing does with the 
water on the bottom.  Alcohal mixes well with gasolene and likes to attach 
itself to water so it tends to remove the water from gas tanks and carbs!  
Kind of like how most hand cleaners work.
  We had a 1967 bus gas tank that apon cutting apart with bronze chisel to 
prevent sparks we found the entire interior was perfectly rust free (Even 
still had the ink stamps inside from the steel manufature!!!) except for down 
at the very bottom where the outlet tube was there had been a trapped pocket 
of water that rusted the tank though there.  This is a design to trap water 
and dirt in the tank.  We prefer to cut the outlet tube as far down as 
possible and when using a reserve switch we pull out the lower brass outlet 
tube to prevent this lower pocket in the tank where the water collects.  
After all gas tanks for our VWs are just going to get harder to find in good 
shape and it is alot easier to occasionally drain the carb resevior and/or 
clean the carb itself.  Instead of having to put up with rusty gas, and 
replacing the tank (Especially in a bus.) when it leaks!
