Subject: Jerome Jamboree XII

Jerome Jamboree XII was a great weekend for everyone who attended, and it was 
a great weekend for the Arizona Bus Club as well.  The weather was absolutely 
perfect for the close to 300 buses in attendance with nearly 2000 people.  
The caravan from Phoenix only had 46 buses in it, but was still pretty 
impressive going up I-17 and later winding up the switch-backs of Mingus 
Mountain.  We kept together very well and never really did have any gaps.  
The club sold out of adult sized event shirts, around 17,000 raffle tickets 
were sold, a hundred or so folks tasted/judged the chili cook-off, a dozen or 
so buses participated in the slow-drags, and the charity auction had some 
really great stuff in it and brought in a lot of money for this year's 
charities.

The semi-restored 1966 single cab was won by Keith Williams from the Phoenix 
area.  In addition, the previous two year's raffle buses were there.  Ryan 
Price from VW Trends took pictures of the 3 raffle buses and their winners 
all lined up.  He and his wife camped out at the event for the weekend and 
took lots of photos.  Not sure how many, will make it into the magazine, but 
we'll see.

I really want to thank all those who attended for their support, as well as 
all the great vendors who donated to the raffle bus and to the raffle in 
general.  The event wouldn't have been the success that it was without you 
all.  A list of donors to the raffle bus can be seen at the club's website 
(www.arizonabusclub_dot_com).  Hopefully within a couple of days we will have a 
list of donors to the general raffle posted to the site as well.

I also want to thank all the list members and ABC members who donated parts 
and labor to get the raffle bus finished as nicely as it was.  Even though it 
wasn't 100% complete or perfect, all I heard all weekend long were positive 
comments about it.  And I know that the guy who won it was so excited he 
couldn't stand it!

And, finally, I want to thank all the people who helped at the event with 
selling shirts and tickets, officiating at the slow-drags, watching the gate 
and so on.  Jerry Jess on the PA was great, as usual.  A lot of help came 
from our California,  New Mexico, and Colorado friends.  And after all, 
that's one of the most important things about events like this: getting 
together with our fellow VW friends who we don't usually see except at events 
like this.  At least it is important to me.

Anyway, thanks again to all who helped in every way with Jerome Jamboree XII. 
 Now it is on to JJ XIII where we will be raffling of a 1966 13 window Deluxe!

See you there,

Jon Stanton, President
Arizona Bus Club
