Now the unthinkable has happened. My car has been stolen Friday and although
we found it Sunday it won't be in use anymore. I was going to OKC as you all
know to pick-up my &quot;new&quot; purchase, a 65 Bus that I have not even seen yet.
Now I can't go since I've got nothing to tow my bus with. I do have a
deposit on the bus. If there is anybody in the OKC area or anywhere that
wants to take it over, please contact me via p-mail and I'll fill you in.
Too bad I can't do it. I was just working on an engine for this baby.

Let me know,

Andre
