Just a quick note to the list before I forget...I went to a Tires Plus today,
and had some tires swapped around, good tires on bad rims transferred to good
rims.  When I was unloading them I did a double-take -- they've been balanced!
This is the first time I've seen a wide-five with wheel weights :-)  I'll be
taking the other two I have down to be balanced as well.  Cool.

In case it's different elsewhere, I can't (until now!) find anywhere around 
here to get these balanced.
