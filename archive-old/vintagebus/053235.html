True, but a NADA value makes it easier to back up a claim when you do not=

have a stated-value policy.

 &gt;Trust me - the value the insurance company puts on the bus, and
 &gt;the value the DMV puts on the bus are as closely related as peanut
 &gt;butter and plutonium...
 &gt;
 &gt;DMV's job is to extract as much money out of you as they can
 &gt;
 &gt;The Insurance company's job is to pay you as little as they can,
 &gt;while extracting as much as they can.  That's why 'agreed value'
 &gt;policies are a joke - they agree on that value when they calculate
 &gt;your premium, but they won't agree on it when it's time to make a 
 &gt;claim.
 &gt;
 &gt;They joy in DMV thinking your bus is worth more is similar to the joy
 &gt;of the county thinking your house is worth more when they re-assess you=
r
 &gt;taxes...
