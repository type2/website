   As I approch rebuilding my engine, I am faced with the problem of using 
an external oil cooler to accomodate a larger engine. I am wondering if full 
flowing the case or just using a full flow oil pump (the kind with inlet and 
outlet on the cover) is a better idea? Any opinions would be greatly 
appreciated, I am specifically going to use the Maxi 3 oil pump if I choose 
to go the pump route. Thanx!
