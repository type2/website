Subject: RE: [VB] more tire pressure

I thought I have seen 205/75/15 LT before, Ill check around. P Metrics will
be the funky sized like 82-84. If you got a tire like a Cooper D rated
commerical
6 or 8 ply, you could get that size and allow for more pressure. Over the
MAX might equate to sidewall failure.

Subject: Re: [VB] more tire pressure


any idea what appens if you runs tires at pressure greater than
reccommended?

the tire wear on the rear of my 61 indicates (by wear at edges) that they
are
underinflated- while they have been at 40psi  (for years) when the
recommended max is 35.  What if I bump it up to 45psi?  Are these things
going to burst on me?  ya i know I should buy new tires that are better
reinforced etc, but still, the question still remains.  and no one says they
have P205/75 R15 in a LT-   and one tire guy I asked was saying certain
tires
are LT when they did not say it in the line stamped on the tire?  what
gives?
 Is this a load of horse hockey?  What above 80 ratio tires- or is I get
euro
size is that ratio 82% or something?  How do I know it is euro sized?  What
does the P mean?  If I am going to dump $300 or $400 bucks on tires I want
to
get the right  goods.   The amount I pay for powder coating and new tires
will be more than I paid for the bus.  geez.  What if I get real tall 195s?
I don't care what size the bus came with (no 185/75/15s please), I care
about
ground clearance, what it does with these tires, and with this gearing the
205 75 15s give good freeway/hill climbing loaded.   God, I can't believe I
am writing on a tire thread, how boring.  bla bla bla.  Why don't I go knit.
Or go to the dump and use their scales to see the rear weight/ front axle
weight/total weight of the bus.

ps safaris suck in the rain.  It's been rainy the last few days.  Watch it
drip past that seal.  Drip drip drip.  Time to swap the windows for the
winter I guess. No they are not FS, don't ask.
