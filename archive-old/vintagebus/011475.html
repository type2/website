Not sure about all of this talk about commuting and how far you should or
shouldn't go.  Fix the damn bus and drive it.  Drive it 3 blocks for a
beer,  Drive it 5000 miles to a good friend's wedding and back.  When
something breaks, fix it again, and drive it more.  

Snuff the engine fire, replace what burned, drive. 

As for coffee; get a 6volt espresso machine that sticks to the dash.  And
a direct I.V. into your vein.  Makes engine fires all that more
exciting...
