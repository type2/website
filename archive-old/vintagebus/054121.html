Subject: Re: [VB] Atlanta &gt; St Pete caravan friday?

Not sure about Dave, but we are leaving Highpoint probably around midnite
tonite down 85 then south on 75 to Tallahassee hopefully by around 10 am
tomorrow(friday) . Stopping there to take possesion of the Binz. I'm driving
it from there to Rafferty's in Largo. Look for a 92 red  F-250 Dually with a
sleeper behind the cab, and a 58 hard top deluxe on the carhauler trailer,
if south of Tallahassee, should be a black 58 Binz DC close by.  If we're on
the side of the road stop, we probably broke something ,,grin,,,. Maybe we
can hook up after we get down to Largo. I'm going there to drop off the 58
to Rafferty first. I'll have my cell with me and on 336-687-6539. Hope to
see ya there.
