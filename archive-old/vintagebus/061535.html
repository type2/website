Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

Yes. The bigger you go the hotter you get as well.
87's have a thinner wall and tend to run hot. I
wouldn't use them but plenty of people do, so i guess
it's a matter of preference. A good investment are the
Berg books that cover engine mods and &quot;How to Hotrod
Your VW&quot;. Both have good advice and pointers for
squuzing some ponies out of your motor without
sacrificing longevity. Personally, I would use
machined 88's or 90.5's and leave the 87's alone. But
what do I know? I've only had 2 motors in my bus for
the last 9 years!
