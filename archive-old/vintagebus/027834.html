Howdy!

I was doing maintenance on my '60 DC yesterday, as the rest of my time is
gonna be spent on trying to get my '66 Westy ready for BYOB and Kelly
Park....I was going to try to get my steering wheel aligned properly, but
couldn't figure out the best way to do it.

I've got the original '60 steering box (which I squirted a bunch of goo
into), and a '68 front end.  The steering wheel is 90 degrees off when going
straight (spokes going up/down).  I would love to fix this!

TIA!
