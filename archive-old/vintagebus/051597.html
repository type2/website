Subject: antenna location

Is there a &quot;correct&quot; location for a radio antenna, or were they just
installed wherever the dealership felt like that day? I see them most
often either center of the nose emblem or on the passenger side of the
nose, any good reason to pick one location over the other?
Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
