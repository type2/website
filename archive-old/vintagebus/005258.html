(was writ:)


Any advice on what metal to use to patch a window sized hole in a panel
bus? Can I obtain steel from the local metal place, or is it recommended to
find a boneyard and make off with an appropriately sized chunk? Does the
German steel make any difference? Thanks.


--------------

  You can get steel from place that sells it. You just need to know what
gauge to get. 11 gauge steel is 1/8 inch thick. The higher the gauge the
thinner it is. The only problem in doing this is that they most likely will
only sell you a 4X8 sheet. You want to make sure you DO NOT get cold rolled
steel. It is covered in oil and a lot harder, plus it costs more. There are
only a few places that make steel so I don't think I'd be too worried about
getting 'German Steel'.
  Some salvage yards probably won't let you cut a hole out of a vehicle. If
you can't find a donor Bus, a hood or a trunk lid off of a big car would
work nicely. Just make sure that the piece you need is flat.
