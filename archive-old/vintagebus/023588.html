&lt;&lt; Anyone ever installed rear seatbelts on a 67 camper? I have a wife and 1 
year 
 old who want to ride with me. I noticed while I Por-15 my floor pan that 
 there are 3 or 4 large black screws under the rear seat/bed. Are these bolts 
 used to hold the floor pan to the chasis? Can I use these to attach my seat 
 belts ? If you drilled holes to anchor your seat belts are there any areas 
to 
 avoid ?
  &gt;&gt;
....unscrew the black plastic screws.  they are plugs in the seat belt 
mounting places.  No need to drill holes, use the factory installed and 
reinforced ones.    Now install seat belts.  Voila!!!!!!!
