&lt;&lt; as for single vs dual port....what exactly are the differences in the 
longblock...is it just in the heads? in other words what if i switched my 
single port heads for the dual port heads? would i need to make any other 
changes?&gt;&gt;

Hi Kevin,
You just need to replace two of the upper inner head studs with longer ones.  
The DP engines from Germany used a thinner head stud that the previous SP 
heads.  Thinner studs apparently stretch better to keep from pressing the 
head and cylinders too much when the engine is heating up to operating temp..
 
&lt; &gt;&gt;

SP is better for those who are not going to drag race and even better for the 
bus due to better lower RPM torque.  You can have alot reground, but not 
pistons.  Do you mean to have the cylinders honed?  PICT30-1 would be best.  
If you have a pre-1961 VW there is a Brazilain carb that the number fails to 
come to mind right now.  It can be found on the Rocky Mountain Motorworks 
(AKA Rocky Mountian Oysterworks!), and has a cable actuated choke like the 36 
HP carbs, but is made with a larger venturi for a 1600cc.  We are running one 
of these we found out at the swaps in our 1960 panel camper conversion on the 
1641cc SP engine with no problems and enjoy a nifty hand choke!

To anyone who is thinking about a new engine we talked to our engine 
rebuilder friends in San Diego a few weeks ago.  A 1641cc (Slip in 
cylinders.) SP engine longblock with new engine case, new Brazilain heads 
modified with the larger exhaust stems (AKA Unleaded heads.) to help prevent 
them stretching there, and a new CW crankshaft.  Is about $1,300 with trade 
in of rebuildable engine core or $1,400.00 without engine core trade in.  
Shipping is extra, he is sending them at least as far as Iowa.  If anyone is 
interested call Butch at Bear's VW Machine (619) 691-8385.  Please tell Butch 
we said &quot;Hi!&quot;.
