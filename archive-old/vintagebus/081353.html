Subject: transaxle front mount and nose cone bushing

My front mount has deteriorated and I noticed recently that I felt some
binding when shifting into third and forth. After inspection I noticed the
nose cone bushing had worked out and is sliding back and forth on the hockey
stick, but the bushing has no damage. Prior to the binding in the shifting
everything was fine, with no unusual noise from the transaxle and no shifting
problems.

I have the engine out now, but have never pulled a transaxle. Can I loosen the
transaxle by removing the rear support bolts and disconnecting the shift
coupler (which will be replaced) and the front mount nuts, then pull it back
far enough to replace the front mount and tap the bushing back into the nose
cone? Or do you volks think I should bite the bullet and pull the transaxle
completely out?

Just thought I might pick a few brains, thanks for any ideas or suggestions.
