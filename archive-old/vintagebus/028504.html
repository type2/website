FWIW...you make a valid point, and I have wondered the same thing.....BUT.... I figure that the engineers that designed the engine in the first place did it for a reason, don't you think. I seriously doubt that they were just sitting around trying to come up with ways of confounding countless millions of amateur and professional mechanics. It is like those darn thermostats and flaps in the fan shroud.... :) 

In almost 20 years of messing with these engines, I have never had an end play issue that couldn't be rectified with three, so I will stick with it. If 0,1,or 2 does it for you and you are comfortable with doing it that way, I say go for it.

&gt; legends, these old wives tales as it were were created just to justify the 
&gt; 3 shim dogma? 
&gt; I pray to thee shims of the holy trinity. Not 1, nor the counts of 2 nor 4 
&gt; shall be blessed. Only 3, the sacred # of the shims shall be.
