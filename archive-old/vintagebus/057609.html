Subject: how does VW know the tons?

With everyone talking about trailers, I had this
thought.  I want to know how VW tested its type 2's,
and rated the suspension.  Is it a half ton or 3/4 ton
vehicle.  What did the factory determine for its
towing rating and/or load rating.  
Also, does anyone on the list have the woflsbyurg kit
and still pulling.  I want to get a little 2 door tent
trailer, like the guy who was at bugorama with a
nimrod.  Thanks list.
