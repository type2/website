Subject: Re: [VB] cranky truck

the thing skid plate is pretty cool,
 It is a 3-piece set up. You have 2 parts that bolt to the long bolts at the
front and rear of the oil sump. It had &quot;bars&quot;that run the length of the sump
and curves around the sump plate so that it can be removed. The third piece
bolts to the 3 hole that a late bus or type 3 uses to mount the hanger bars.
this piece comes down and covers the gap between the lower cylinder tin and
the muffler. The only thing it really does is keep things from hitting the
cooling tin, fins  or catching the sump plate.

&gt; Now that's kewl!
&gt; How'd the thing plate attach?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I made use of the NOS bus muffler
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had been hoarding and I bolted up the Thing skid plate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the underside of the motor. I used a crankstart nut to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attach the belt pulley and cut a small hole in the tin
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just big enough for the crank end to pass through. Bolted
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up the crank start apron I found half buried in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Georgia mountains, replaced the rear gate and clutch tube,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now its ready to start. Started it with the key the first
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time, I must say this type 3 auto starter kicks but. Then
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I successfully started by hand 3 time in a row. I cant
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wait to freak out all the people at work, They think I am
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nuts enough driving a VW truck.
