In the past six months I have sold a bus, now drive a
non-vw and continue to fade from the scene as I can no
longer afford splitties primarily due to the over
inflated perceived valuation of the remaining dreggs
of the available split buses and ever increasing cost
of basics like 34-3 PICT carbs, raw engine cases and
all of the other billion parts.

I agree with that, these engines are getting awfully expensive to build
and maintain lately, Has me thinking about a jetta/golf either diesel or
gas conversion for a bus.  Just can't decide splitty or baywindow.
(and before someone yells at me about sacrelige, I plan on starting with a
bus that 90% of you people would have sawzalled without a second thought,
so back off)

I do *not* support over pricing-hyper inflating the
&quot;value&quot; of rusted bondoed sawzall candidates as are
regularly marketed on the popular sites.

Well, I think good deals are still out there on driver quality busses, but
perfect examples should be going up.  I agree with you that some people
are smokin the crack rock it seems, but I guess if the Japaneese keep
buyin everything decent for beans prices will have to go up on the
leftover dregs...

I see Doublecabs with hacked wheelwells, rusted to hell, dented and no
mechanicals people are trying to sell for $4,000.  I see perfectly
straight ones go for $6-800. Its crazy, but thats life. Supply and demand
etc.

Baywindows are still cheap though, If you want to get away from greedy
selfish &quot;shiny part pimp's&quot; that will rip off little old ladies/generous
friends to buy a part (double door middle seat??) for $2, brag about it
and offer it to you five minutes later for $5,878.52 FIRM. Go baywindow,
its sane for now, and they are easier to repower with something different.

I like splitties better, but i have 2 bays 2 vgons and 3 splits, I can
easily enough change what I drive and sell something... My big dilemma now
is do I put the Golf/jetta engine in my 66 deluxe POS or my 70 deluxe POS.

peas,

Steve
