Subject: [VB] What causes a busted axle?
Message-ID: &lt;3821C5E2.D2E2A034_at_fibertel_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

Well, I've postponed asking this question as I haven't been in a major
hurry to get it fixed, as the bus still needs a lot of other things.
But now, I have found out my landlord is selling the house that I rent
and I will need to move.  Anyways, here is the issue at hand.

The '65 I picked up in May, has a busted axle.  I pulled the tranny, and
noticed that of the 6 (8??) nuts that hold the cover over the side of
the tranny, only 4 were there on the drivers side.  When I pulled the 4
nuts off, the whole assembly fell off.  The redux box, and axle attached
just came right out.  In other words, the axle itself is sheared off.
The flat part, at the end that actually goes into the tranny is sort of
T-shaped.  When I pulled the axle out, a 1 inch by 1/2 inch piece of the
end of the T axle fell out onto the floor.

The redux spins freely, the tranny spins freely.  I can't find anything
that is locked up.  Where do I go from here?  Tranny rebuild, replace
the axle?  HELP, I've got to have it running in a couple months.

Thanks,
Aaron
