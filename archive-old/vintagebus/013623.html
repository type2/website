&gt; Yes, Jerome Jamboree articles have been printed in both (I think)
&gt; major

&gt; Jess has 
&gt; sent in stories/photos.  In fact I think that Jerry has sent in an
&gt; article 
&gt; fore most, if not all of the Jerome Jambories.  One year there was
&gt; even an 
&gt; article printed that was submitted by someone the ABC board didn't
&gt; even know. 
&gt; Not that there was anything wrong with that.  

Here you've touched on a key point.  The VW mags are far from being Big
Business (although their publishing companies are closer) and simply
don't have the magazine coffers that allow them to cover every event. 
If they sent a staffer on the Great Silver Bird to cover every event
they would soon go out of business!  The staffers also have to devote
some time to actually getting the magazine out.

A lot of magazines (and not just VW rags) depend upon low- and un-paid
reporting from their readerships.  If you want to see an event covered
in a magazine, send them a story and photos and you have a fair chance
of getting some press.

It is a good idea to communicate with the magazine in advance and get a
copy of their editorial requirements and then to follow them to the
letter.  The easier you make it for them to publish your work, the more
likely it is to be used.

Yes, you too can be a Published Writer (tm)!  Eventually they might
even be convinced to pay you for your output!  :)

&gt; The point is that the magazines themselves refuse to cover Jerome
&gt; 
&gt; Jamboree and many other rather large events, simply
&gt; because......well, I'm 
&gt; not sure why!

I don't think that &quot;refuse&quot; is correct.  &quot;opt not to&quot; is more accurate.
I doubt that any VW-type would refuse to go to this event, but
sometimes real life gets in the way.  I live in SoCal, would _love_ to
go to Jerome, but unfortunately my job makes it impossible.
