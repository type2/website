Subject: Complete Tranny Swap, bus to bug?
To: Bus Vintage &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

After much reading of the archives, AGAIN, I still have a question:

Ya'll have previously covered some swapping of tunnel case to split casers, and RGB gearing and
teething(enough to call in a dentist), and, also the more recent bug tranny use, with a different
nosecone, as well as an inverted ring and pinion.  BUT... can we now cover (or cover again, if I
missed it) the complete bus to bug tranny swap, including eliminating the RGB's?

I have a friend who is wanting to do this swap, and would like some info.  He is interested in
doing this as cost effectively as possible (ain't we all).  He is looking for better highway
speed, hill-climbing gearing, as well as the possibility of a little more speed in the flats than
his stock 65 model currently provides.  You guys and gals out there, that follow this list, may
have used, manufactured, or (for those who are fortunate enough) own/work for a place that sells a
nice little package deal to do this swap.  However, he is trying to not spend that money on a
package kit, but for other things.  What are the neccesities in doing this swap?  We have also
heard that Type 3 axles are suggested, for a difference in length??  Is this true?

Amongst ourselves, and those in our club, we do have access to do some machine work, have
experienced welders, as well as very experienced VW mechanics and caretakers... however, none that
have done this swap before, nor know all the details of it.  Before he gets in too deep, he's
wanting to get a little more specific info.  Again, he's using a stock 65 model set-up, currently,
a 1600 DP, and is looking for more highway and/or interstate climbing ability out of 3rd and 4th,
especially.  No heavy towing here, only very light (maybe 400lbs., fully loaded) trailer, rarely
used.

We would like to have a better understanding of what pieces are included in these kits, and, if
possible, how to do it ourselves?

For those who have done it: are you happy with your gearing and which model tranny did you
use(what is your gearing)?  Would you have any comments on how to make the required pieces
yourself, or how to make what you purchased better?

Any suggestion/ help will be accepted, including another method of getting the appropriate gearing
he wants to have, using the info given.

Thanks for your help, in advance!!
