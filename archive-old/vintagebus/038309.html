Subject: How cold for setting valves?

Hi List,

Is it necessary to leave the car overnight to set the valve timing? I've run
outa weekends before I leave on a trip and this is the last piece of
maintenance that I still have to do.

I'd like to do it tonight after letting the bus stand for about 4 hours or
until the sump is cold to the touch. Is this unwise?

Later

Michael
