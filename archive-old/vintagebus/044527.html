&lt;&lt; Does anybody know what part of '62 VW went from small hatch window to
 big hatch window?  Was it the early quarter?  Also...does anyone on list
have
 a spacer for the front left drum shaft of the '62?  TIA &gt;&gt;

Hi Christopher,
&gt;From 1955-63 the bus used the same sized rear hatch.  Then in the 1964
production model the hatch was widened.  You mention windows and the pre-1964
rear hatches had the same sized windows except for the delux bus that had a
bigger window.
