Heck, the cutoff for Bad Camber is '58, isn't it?  We should be so lucky!

&gt; Y'know, that seems to be a very arbitrary division.  Why a '67 bus and not
&gt; a '68?  Both vehicle share most of the same design details and differ
&gt; only in the cosmetics of the body and a few running gear improvements
&gt; (which '67-down folks seem to love to incorporate into their buses)  The
&gt; line is even thinner between '67 and '68 bugs.
