&gt; Dont worry about it.
I won't looses any sleep over this VF topic :-) .  I assumed as much that all 
7-seaters were walkthroughs.

&gt;  didn't one bus in the neato registry have 3 or so codes fmeaning 
walkthrough on it?
At least one had 081 and 082, some maybe more, hold on....
...sorry for the delay.  

All categories are exclusive:

63 080 (all commercials except 217100514 listed 221 ?)
88 081 (all passenger except 285109116 listed 231 ?)
0  082 
0  080+081
9  081+082 (all 251 and 281)
0  080+082
0  080+081+082

So, Clara, none of the busses on Thom's registry had all 3 walkthrough codes. 
 NEATO's data is not available to me.  I noticed the BK/NEATO/SSVC spec book 
lists 083 as a walkthrough code.  No busses in the registry have 083.

Note that the meaning of 082 and 083 is unclear.  

Of the two hundred sixteen 7-seaters in Thom's registry:
9  have 081+082 
51 have just 081 (37 251's and 14 281's)
therefore 156 have no walkthrough M code in fact or in omission

Well, I thought I was on to something (besides fumes), but I can't see any 
correlation.  I thought I would be able to say something about 082 like, &quot;082 
means 7-seaters with redundant walkthrough Mcode&quot;, but that is not the case 
since 51 7-seaters have 081 without 082.

To answer my original anal inquiry, there are about 26 23-window walkthroughs 
in the registry (8 241's, no 244's, and about 18 251's)
