Subject: Search for a Bus Tent

At a reasonable cost, I know Ha Ha!

But what I'm looking for is one that goes to the, um &quot;bay window
campers&quot;, our 72 to be exact.

I ask you nice folks as I figure someone has got to have one and never
use it with your Split!

The condition does not need to be perfect and would hope the price would
reflect such, we mainly want the
original one so we can take our dogs on more camping trips and be able
to allow them more sleeping space
outside the bus, but still be contained by the flooring of the tent.

If you have one please let me know here or at vwtruck_at_concentric_dot_net

Thank You!

Meredith
