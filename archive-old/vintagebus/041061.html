Subject: 56 panel sigla glass and truck tilt

I spoke with Jill in the tri-cities the other day seems she was taking the
logoed windshields out of her bus and cracked one :-( so much for a trade.

The tilt she is making me is still not done yet but I hope to pick it up at
the Yakima show. Pic's will follow
