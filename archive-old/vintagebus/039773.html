HA, thats funny... my mom has one of these for her dog. i saw it one day and 
thought, &quot;boy, that looks like something under my bus.&quot; but at the time 
couldnt think what it was. i dont think they'd be good on a bus, the're 
hollow :-) kind of a cruel toy, they are hollow so you can slip a dog cookie 
inside and the dog chews and chews trying to get at it.
