&gt; Are the valves adjusted to spec?

Yup, several times!


Tom,


&gt; Did you notice anything unusual the last few times you adjusted them?  Did
&gt; they go from rarely needing adjustment to one or two being way off?  Etc.

Nope, they're perfectly stable, on time, in time, and in spec!

&gt; Can you push or pull on the flywheel and feel any endplay?  Even with the
&gt; engine installed, you can feel it if you've got excessive endplay -- ask
&gt; me how I know!

No, endplay is .004&quot;, right dead center spec, hasn't changed in years.

&gt; Before you do something like tearing down the engine, you might just want
&gt; to take a look at the valve adjusters and push rods on the noisy side...

I've had that side open and disassembled the rocker arm assy twice now,
looking for the usual broken or missing parts.

I've used a large screwdriver to stethoscope the engine, and everything
sounds fine, both sides, using it. I touch it to the case just to the left
and right of the oil pump, and on the upper side, left and right of
center, and also the exhaust pipe headers. The sounds sound regular and
normal, though I have no real prior experience at that type of listening.
There are no tapping sounds using that method.
