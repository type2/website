&gt; Hi David,
&gt; Have you tried sealing the outer seal to the body frame, and the inner seal
&gt; to both the frame and glass with roofing tar?  Eric&amp;Barb

Hello Eric and Barb,

That's one of the projects I have in line. I've had some trouble with
RMMW latches breaking on me and have a set ordered (of course, they are
regular vent wing latches, and they have to be cut, drilled and
countersunk to work with the safaris), and I'd like to redo both sets of
seals (frame and glass). The roofing tar sounds like a good idea. I may
need to try to get a little less pressure between the body seal and
window frame, so I won't keep breaking the latches...
