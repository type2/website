It's not as bad as everyone says.  I have a 4 foot long piece of 4x4 pine 
that I lay on the tire and drive my M*zda up onto.  This pops the bead 
loose from the rim.  Then, flip it over and repeat for the other 
side.  Then, work the tire off the rim using 2 or 3 large prybars.  Make 
sure the bead of the tire is in the groove in the center of the rim as you 
pry it off, or you won't get anywhere.  I work from the back side of the 
rim to avoid damaging the face.  It's an acquired skill, but you will get 
better at it as you go.  Of course, there are times I just don't feel like 
f***ing with it and I take them over to the used tire shop and have them 
dismounted for $2 each.  But for onesey-twosey jobs, it works fine.
