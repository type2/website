Subject: a few parts needed for my 57

--part1_158.cbbe71f.29f57021_boundary


     Hi everyone,

    My 57 (early) truck is about to be assembled and I'm down to needing a 
few odds          and ends.  Anyone with a dead bus should have most of these 
things.
     12 volt battery strap and any hardware
     2 window vent latches (mine are crappy)
     
     2 engine compartment hinges and hardware
     clip that keeps the brake pedal arm from moving

     2 sliding window latch ( mine need rechroming, so it would depend on $$)
      fuse cover (baklite) I thru mine out....oops!
     1 gray knob
      knob for air vent (gray)
      6 bolts for air faceplate
      6 screws for the side window ( plate at bottom)

      metal piece thats under the seat -attatched to rest of truck, mine was 
cut out
      to make more storage under seat
 
      2 bolts that hold the rear apron on
      center brakelight and lens etc
      set of hardware to hold engine in
      2 bolts for the gas cap door
      correct floor mat
      divider section for underneath compartment and hardware  
     
      And last for now I will need to find a rebuilt engine (ready to run)  
Any help will be 
appreciated.  I'll post  some pics soon so everyone can see the results
                                                          Steve 57 singlecab 
(early)
