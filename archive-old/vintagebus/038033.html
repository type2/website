Hi Dan,
We agree!  Also the stock heavier flywheel helps dampen out shocks and 
vibrations to the engine bearings especially the #1 bearing and it thrust 
surfaces.  Plus the heavier stock flywheel really helps the engine idle 
properly (Which is another reason we like the stock heavier steel lower 
pulley instead of the aluminuim lighter aftermarket pulleys.), instead of 
having to keep punching the gas pedal to keep it going at a stop light.  The 
stock muffler would be better to keep the engine cooler and better MPG.  
Unless you plan to keep the engine well over 4,000 RPM most of the time the 
stock muffler is better and less likely to carbon monoxide you and your 
passengers!  The dual carbs a real a good idea if you know carbs well.  If 
you do not know carbs well then set the dual carbs aside for a while and get 
some hands on knowledege with the single stock carb.  With a single carb 
things are not complicated with double parts to mess with newbies minds!  If 
you really want to do something to trick up the engine you really should 
dissasemble the engine, balance the rods, pistons, and check everything out 
inside and outside the engine by blueprinting.  Also clean out the casting 
flash out of the head fins, install a type 4 cooler that is 40% bigger than 
the doghouse cooler, install a counterwieghted crank, and a full flow 
filteration system.  After all of that install the engine and tach where the 
RPMs are in each forward gear!   Eric&amp;Barb
