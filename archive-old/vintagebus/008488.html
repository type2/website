The old &quot;downshift or brake&quot; argument has been around forever, with good arguments on both sides, but I just gotta say, if I was coming down a steep, slick, windy road, I'd feel a lot more in control if I had the engine connected to the wheels rather than just freewheelin' in neutral and leaving it all up to the brakes. Kind of like how 4-wheel drive gives you more control than 2-wheel drive- you've got the engine connected to more wheels.

But that's just my opinion :-)

OTOH, there's this huge freeway downgrade near San Luis Obispo. When I was younger and dumber, I used to put the bus in neutral and coast. I could get it up to 80-90 mph...much faster than it would ever go in gear!

&gt; Certainly, brake shoes/pads are cheaper than transaxles or engines, but a
&gt; decent funeral costs more than the whole bus!
