&gt; People claim that a dry sump system give a HP boost over regular oil pan

the HP gain is supposedly from keeping the crankshaft out of the oil.  The
oil causes drag.

However, if you've ever seen video of the interior of an operating engine
it looks like a version of Hell, with hot oil being flung everywhere.  the
best description is that the engine is filled with a hot, thick, oil mist.
