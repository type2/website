I am definitely a novice when it comes to the world of busses, but I am 
learning new things each day. Tonight I had a bummer experience with my bus, 
'66 deluxe 1600sp. The bus always starts on the first turn, until tonight. 
Nothing not even a click, all with the lights still illuminating the night 
sky. Where should I start? Bad relay, wires to check, ignition? I am open to 
any and all suggestions.

Thank you in advance for any help that can get me on my 500 mile roadtrip 
this weekend without having to push start the poor thing each time.

first, turn the headlights on.  if they are dim the battery is low   (check 
it with a voltmeter is avalable).   you may have left something on, or have a 
charging problem.
  if not

are your battery terminals clean?    clean off both the pos and the neg and 
where the ground strap goes to the body.   cant hurt.

if it still doesn't start,   go under neath the bus forward of the right rear 
wheel.  look up  by the heater tube,   find the starter.   shine your light 
on it.   a 13mm nut holds some wires on there, and a big red wire has a push 
on connection.   make sure the big red wire is on there good, and then undo 
the 13mm nut, clean the wires, and put that back together.   still no start?

go back to the starter, and cross the terminals between the big red wire 
(comes from the ignition switch) and the 13mm nut wires (hot- to battery).    
if it starts now, you have a problem in the wires to the front and/or 
ignition switch.    if not, likely the starter is dead, and needs replacing.  
 (unless there isn't enough juice- then ts a battery/charging problem).
