Good day bus people -
I can't seem to find much in the archives regarding recommended and
available tires for the 15&quot; rims. Is there anyone out there riding
around on appropriate tires they are well pleased with and would buy
again? This bus is transportation, not a show car, so it doesn't have
to be stock.
Thanks,
Joel
