This should tell you something, actually.  The idea here is that
you'll start buying all your tools from them (same scam that Sears
uses on Craftsman).  Just like with insurance, most tools aren't
abused enough to fail, so the profit on those makes up for the losses
on the ones that do.  That $20 retail typically translates into about
$5 cost for them, so it doesn't take a whole lot of additional tool
sales to break even on the trade-in.

That's not to say you shouldn't take advantage of such offers, just
realize that you're not going to get top-of-the-line tools out of it.
