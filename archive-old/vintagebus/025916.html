Karl,

The plate reads:

1  6  D

425  A42 080 108

UK  2312 523907 7073183

Looks like mine is a 72,558 later than yours

&gt; What are the all the numbers on your plate behind the pass. seat?
&gt;
&gt; My 67 Standard walk-thru is vin # 227000625. Its build date is 05 7 [on the
&gt; top row of the plate] which is July 5th, 1966. Supposedly 67 production
&gt; started Aug 1st, 66 but this is the 2nd 67 that I know of that was built in
&gt; July. Mine does not have backup lights.
