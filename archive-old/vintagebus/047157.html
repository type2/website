 had the chance to own a pre 62 yet (except for my 61 still stuck in AL and 
 has aftermarket tail lights). One of the chrom rings is a little pitted and 
 the other one is ok. I do need one lense though since one is cracked down 
 the middle.

This is usual.  My advice is superglue the halves together and use it 
cracked, unless you wanted the super sweet cherry ride.  

Funny thing is I was looking at a 58 DD panel the other day, and the guy who 
had it said the PO had purposely cracked the taillight lenses.  Cause he had 
had two pairs stolen.
