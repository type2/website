&gt; Does anyone's speedo needle do the same thing?  Mine bounces all over the

I tried fixing mine myself but it only lasted a
little while.  I finally took it in and had it repaired at a local
speedometer shop and it seems to be fine ever since.  Cost was $50 I
think.  He didn't do the indicator cells though, so next time I will have
those ready.
