Yes, I know.  We've chatted extensively off-list about paint and bus issues.

&gt; Hey Thom,
&gt;    The other hedberg is my Dad, he's the one that turned me on to the list 
&gt; in the first place, he was always telling me about all these &quot;cool dudes on 
&gt; the list&quot;, so I thought I would give it a try! Its really nice to have two 
&gt; old busses in the house and I can't wait till we can both caravan to shows 
&gt; and show off our busses (mine is a 63' panel, and his is the rarer 62' 15 
&gt; win dlx) and I thought I had something to show off! Later

Thom
