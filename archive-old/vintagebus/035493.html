Hi all,

Just got my bus ('64) back from the mechanic.  He says he thinks the front
torsion bars are &quot;froze up&quot;.  This is not why I had it in the shop, and I have
not noticed any thing strange about the ride at all.  He says &quot;that's why it
rides so hard&quot;.  Don't all buses ride somewhat hard?  Is there some way I can
be sure this guy isnt messing with me?  By the way, he said he wouldnt want to
try and fix it even if it was broken.
&quot;Too much trouble&quot;  What do you guys think?  Is there something i can look
for?

Thanks
