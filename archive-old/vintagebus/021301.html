 Questions:
 
 Anyone know how to remove the colored bubbles for the idiot lights?

I dont think you can.  I would added a piece of coloured plastic in there, if 
yours are as faded as mine are.  or paint the old plastic.

 Anyone know how to remove the switches from the speedo plate?

drill out the rivets.  I need to do this on my 53, the headlight switch gets 
scarily hot.  Actually I am not sure how to do this.  I have this spare 
bakelite dash plate (black for standard micro) that has nicer bakelit than 
the one in my bus,  and I can't see exactly what the deal is.   The 53/54 
workshop manual is no help.    so please let me know whta you find.  :)
 = = = = = = = = = = 
 Observations:
 
 * My bus was built 12/54; the clock is dated 10/54 and the speedo 7/54.  I
 think this should put paid to the phreaks that think everything on the car
 must bear the same date code.
  &gt;&gt;- - -  - -
I didn't know people thought that.  I would expect the date code on the parts 
to be earlier than the production of the bus, but as the clock comes off one 
pile and the wheels another and the speedo another and the gen another, and 
the oil pressure switch another, etc matching would be a coincedence.  The 
wheels froim my bus made 6/53 are dated sometime in 52.  I found a oil 
pressure switch dated 6/53.  I think thats cool, even it the original would 
be dated earlier.
