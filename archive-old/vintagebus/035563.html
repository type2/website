&lt;&lt; I am thinking of having the 6volt starter tip machined down to 12volt size 
and running it in the stock 12v bushing.  I am not sure running the thin one

 gonna be safe.  Especially that the case been eatin into a bit. &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
That should work depending on how damaged the bushing hole in the tranny case 
is, but of course if another starter is needed in the future the same 
machining will be required again.  
Unfortunitly there is not enough material in that area to fully support an 
early 6 volt starter bushing if you did drill and ream it to the larger OD of 
the early bushing.
What might be better in the long run is to drill and ream the hole in the 
tranny bigger and have a machine shop make a steel bushing for this bigger OD 
hole and still use the stocker 6 volt starter in a 12 volt tranny bronze 
bushing inside of this.
