  While on my journey to the docks I stopped by one of my major suppliers
warehouse to see what's new and exciting in the VW import parts market and
was shown the new VW Factory de Brazil engines. These are different then the
ones from Mexico, they use a AS 41 single relief case, the weird part is
that the hole for the duel relief is there just not drilled and tapped. The
next thing is that these come with the pulley tin and the belt pulley
installed. Then they also had the center pivot attached on them for duel
carb's, now if I could only get the new duel carb set-up the factory uses.
At first I thought these were for type 3's but there was no oil fill plate
on the front of them to be able to be used in a type 3. After some
questioning, it turned out that these were Brand New Bus engines not bug or
replacement engines like the ones from Mexico, interesting I must say. I
purchased one of these to test and will keep the list up on the results. I
also bought another freight damaged Mexican engine, this one had broken fins
on the head, again I will be offering this one to the list first for
$1000.00 outright, with the new head installed. If you are looking for a NEW
engine, this is a deal, as the NEW Brazil engines now cost $1450.00
outright. There still are some Mexican ones left for $1400.00.
