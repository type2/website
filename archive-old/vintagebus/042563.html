hi all,

I was driving my split back from KC when it occured to me...

I had noticed the rear rode softer than the front... and had chalked it up
to splits being splits.

Then i got to thinking... i had been operating under the impression that
they just changed the brakes to go to 1 ton in 63-4 but they probably
changed the spring rates too...

Thus my 67 beam has stiffer springs than my 61 beam.

My plan is to put the leaves from my trashed 61 beam into my 67 beam so as
to even up the handling and ride back to factory specs, while retaining
the advantages of 1 ton brakes... (even if i upgrade to a later transaxle,
i'll still end up having the 61 torsions in back..)

Anyone have any input?

take care,

Steve

p.s. since i never haul anything even remotely close to 3/4 ton, i dont
think i'll have a problem with the softer suspension, hehe.
