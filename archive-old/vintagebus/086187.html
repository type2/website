Subject: Bus Benefit! Buses By the Beach May 19-21 Itinerary

Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

We are only one week away from the fourth annual &quot;Bus Benefit!&quot; hosted by
Buses By the Beach_dot_com and Sponsored by GoWesty_dot_com! We will be meeting in
Grand Rapids, MI May 19, 20, &amp; 21. This event is our main fund raiser for
Burn Survivors. We are really looking forward to seeing everyone and it
looks like we are going to have another great turn out again this year of
Bus Pilots from all over the US and Canada! 

 

We also have good news to report. This week we have been made an officially
licensed Volkswagen Organization by Volkswagen of America. Thanks VWoA! This
means they believe in what we are doing and have given us the ability to use
their trademarked names and logos for our non-profit purposes. 

 

If you have not made your reservations yet please do so by calling
616-361-1053 and let tell them you are with the Buses Group. This is
important so we can plan enough space for everyone. For directions and other
information about the campground please go to:
http://www.michcampgrounds_dot_com/grandrogue/

 

The itinerary for this weekends events are as follows:

 

Friday May 19, 2006

*         2 p.m. till ?????

*         Check in at Grand Rogue Campground

*         Campfire and Conversation. Greet old friends and welcome new ones.
Hang out with fellow bus pilots enjoying the day and each others company. 

 

Saturday May 20, 2006

*	8:30 a.m. Line up for carabus to Burn Survivor Car Show (Yes, we
know it's early, but it's worth it and it's for a great cause!)
http://www.burnsurvivorcarshow_dot_com/ This is a huge car show and last year
had over 600 cars. Don't worry if you do not have a show quality vehicle.
Most of us don't. We just come as we are and have a great time. Warts and
all!
*	8:45 a.m. Leave for Car Show. The Plainfield Fire Department and
local Law Enforcement will be escorting us Presidential Motorcade style.
They will lead us 6 miles from the campground to the car show down West
River Drive. This is always a ton of fun!
*	9:00 a.m. Arrive and set up at car show. There will be monster truck
rides, a giant auction with tons of donated merchandise, and hopefully we
will reclaim the award for best club participation. (even though we are not
a club, clubs are boring and have too many politics)
*	3:00 p.m. Head back to the Grand Rogue Campground to relax and enjoy
the afternoon. This would be a good time for those wanting to go on a canoe
trip or bike ride to go. There is a canoe livery at the campground and a
great bike trail within in a couple of miles. There is also some great
mountain bike trails nearby. 
*	6:00 p.m. Raffle! Everyone's favorite raffle Captain Pete O takes
the stage with a plethora of donated VW related prizes and goodies. 
*	7:00 p.m. to ???? Fireside Jam! This year we welcome Steve VanWyk
and Eric Hollebeek from Blue Country for some fireside Bluegrass Jamin'! If
you play an instrument, please feel free to bring it and join in. Please
don't be intimated by your skill level. We always say, &quot;It's not about
sounding good, just feeling good!&quot;

 

Sunday May 21, 2006

*	7 a.m. Caravan to MVVC Show in Ypsilanti MI for those interested
*	8 a.m. Breakfast Buses By the Beach Style! Sunday morning wake up
and eat. We will have pancakes, eggs and breakfast burritos. Come and enjoy,
all is welcome. 
*	For those sticking around Sunday is a time to just hang out with
friends and enjoy the day and each others company. 

 

Alcohol is permitted at the campground but obnoxious drunks are not. We have
never had to ask anyone to leave because of their behavior and judging by
the good people that come to Buses By the Beach events I am sure it will
always stay that way. Tom Briggs at Grandrogue Campground has always been
such a wonderful host and we do not want to do anything that would wear out
our welcome with him.

 

We look forward to seeing old friends again and meeting new ones. If this is
you first time coming to a Buses By the Beach event and would like to ask
some questions please feel free to visit our message board at:

Wishing you many miles of smiles in your bus!
