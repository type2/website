Subject: Re: [VB] engine test

&gt;I have ran engines for hours
without the regulator with no problems.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong 
here
please . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import service  Salem Va&lt;

I have done the same and not roasted the generator.  Granted in the Bentley 
it says it will fry in short order....  I do not know why mine do not fry 
really?  Maybe Bentley exagerated a bit?

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
