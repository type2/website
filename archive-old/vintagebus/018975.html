Hey Thom, please post this invitation for a back road adventure tour to Mt. Shasta.  Not for foolish children with lowered busses, this caravan to Shasta will follow some really rough roads climbing out of Lake Pillsberry.  After that, the rest of the trek is purely secondary back roads all the way.  I expect the trip to take about eight hours. Short notice, I know, but better late than never!  Pass it on, and hey...I hope to have you and your pals come along!  Thanks, Brian Piercy.
 
SNOW TRIP TO MT. SHASTA 2001!

GROUND HOG DAY- FEB. 2ND, 3RD,4TH   Contact: Brian Piercy _at_ 707-869-1987 or kombisutra_at_hotmail_dot_com

MY SISTER SAID: &quot;WHOA! YOU WANT ME TO BE ROAD CREW IN THAT PIECE #$%**!!&quot;  Exactly!  The three decade old camper bus with torn and skanky upholstery, minor rat sh*t deposits, funky sixties era paneling and rattles that promise hearing loss for the long term really is an excellent choice for an adventurous road trip to remember.and she'll be there!

Your stock old bus sets the atmosphere for the trip.kinda' risky, and necessitating an expectation for the unexpected!  No other car company can boast such potential excitement!  The trip would have us away from home for 72 hours.  We would depart from Napa Friday at zero-four-hundred hours for the longest and most brutal leg. The route planned is slow, adventurous, circuitous, bumpy, loud, cold,  and physically demanding for both passengers and driver. This part of the trip will have the whole crew working to keep their ship together.  Anything not strapped down or secured will be tossed about (helmets are at the passenger's discretion). Grab a good map, preferably a Northern California Gazetter and see where we're going.  We're headed straight into the Clearlake mountains to pass through Lake Pilsberry, through the Mendocino National Forest west to Covelo, north to Zenia, and northeast to the raging community of Ruth on mostly secondary roads.  We'll then increase our averag!
!
!
e ground speed and comfort level by continuing over faster and better-paved secondary roads starting with Highway 36 and then 3, just to the north.  Passing through various toothless outposts like Mad River, Peanut, Hayfork and Douglas City, we'll find our selves at the actual community of Weaverville.  Weaverville's mercantile is loaded with great new products to make life out in these here parts easygoing. Here, you'll be able to trade your season's pannings for tack for your mule, traps to replace the ones the bears keep running off with, and cartridges for your rifles.44, 3006, 3030, all the varmint calibers, and just in, 12 and 20 gauge shotgun cartridges! We'll stop in here and spend some time shopping, eatin', and stretching our legs.

Once we get our new traps and merchandise strapped to the roof racks or safely packed inside, and-providing that we hear it's open- we'll be off again heading north up highway 3 past Trinity Center and up through Klamath National Forest.  Before getting to Etna, we'll head northeast up Gazelle-Callahan Road, which will take us out to Highway 5 and Weed.  Our destination of Mt Shasta the town, lies 10 miles south.

Due to temperatures typically in the teens around Mt. Shasta (elevation 5000 feet), reservations for two nights at one of the charming snow-bound motels that dot the rustic main drag are recommended. There's also a KOA campground on the north end of town for the teams that have gas heaters.  Babs and I stayed in a nice motel last year that had this cool, huge, 1940s Dodge Power Wagon snowplow parked in front.  The place had an outside hot tub that we hadn't prepared for. And, the downtown area-within walking distance- has a real party atmosphere with vacationing skiers packing the dance floors and bars.  Quite a festive time and setting to let one's worries of work and home life rest.

Skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, shopping or driving the fun dirt service roads adjacent to the railroads that come in to Mt Shasta would keep your activity up for the following day.  Shushing down the slopes of Mt Shasta Ski Park or silently sliding through the surrounding forest on the cross-country trails.that's what I'm looking forward too.  After the day's activities, maybe a nice dinner at the real German restaurant within walking distance to most motels followed by disorderly behavior at the lively bars.

Things to consider bringing along: tire chains, spare gas, full tool kit, jack, spare tire, plug kit,  spare engine parts, fan belt, extra wheel cylinder for front and back, extra headlight (to replace the one you killed the deer with- no joke), extra brake fluid, three quarts of oil, JB Weld, Duct Tape, a current edition Delorme Northern California Atlas &amp; Gazeteer (Mandatory! $15 at most book stores- could save your life! Shows every road we'll be traveling) a good first-aid kit, distress whistle on your person (cell phones probably still haven't saved as many lives as whistles yet), cell phone (which may not work reliably so distant from cell sites),  Citizens Band radio, propane lantern with extra mantles (don't overlook this one), Bic lighter, good flashlights-plural, warm clothes, a sleeping bag and food for a couple days.  Basically, you get 450 miles of chances to have an accident where you won't be found.  Prepare for the worst! 

 We'd be packed and loaded early the next morning for the trip home.the short way.  Down Highway 5 to 20 and back to Napa.  Numerous options exist to get home via even more incredible adventure routes.of which do take more time but defy explanation of beauty and remoteness.  Please ask me if you've got the energy and time to adventure all the way home too!  C'mon! Caravan's hitting the road Groundhog day, Friday, February second! Road Trip! Road Trip!  C-mon!  Let your hair down, put on a warm ski cap and let's turn the clocks back 30 years! Brian.
