Subject: Re: Just how fast does your bus go??

my '66 bus has a stock, xcept for 009, 1500 with a smalll nut (i dont know 
why) i have 205/15's on it and cruise at 51mph _at_ 3800rpm. i have plenty of 
pedal over that to pass, but she starts screaming. before i tached it, i 
would cruise at 60 and actually be at 4500 rpm!!!! at this speed i get a oil 
that blows by the crank. i have the berg dipstick and if i try to cruise any 
faster, it starts flickering (225?) i want to go a bit faster, but the 
tranny is soooo quiet and shifts so nice... (i just need some shifter 
bushings)
