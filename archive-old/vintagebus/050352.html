Volks-

I went out to my bus to run a quick errand on Saturday, but the engine only
turned about half a revolution, and wouldn't go any further.  I got out,
opened the engine cover, and quickly noticed gas dripping from the base of
the carb.  (Actually from the nut holding the rod the butterfly valve is
attached to, I think.)  I suspected that the float had stuck, and had
probably filled a cylinder or two with gas, effectively hydrolocking the
engine.

I had the bus towed on Monday to the shop where they were able confirm my
diagnosis.  (This is the same shop that misdiagnosed a &quot;stumble&quot; problem a
few weeks ago, and replaced my nearly new 34Pict with a rebuilt carb.  The
problem turned out to be the dizzy, but I still have the rebuilt carb).

My questions are:

1) How likely is it that damage was done to the rods or head bolts by my
attempt to start a hydrolocked engine?

2) How likely is it that &quot;something&quot; caused the float to stick?  (Note,
there was no gas filter, but the tank had recently been cleaned and sealed)

3) What do I do with the remains of the mechanic?
