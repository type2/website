Subject: Still searching for west coast Crew Cab

Rex and I's most recent California crew cab turned out to be a bust.  Turns
out the seller was more than a bit delusional about the condition of his
1961.

Back to square one..  anyone comes across a '67 or earlier Crew Cab, here
are my objects:  1) engine of no concern, even willing to go without one.
2) Body is most important, little or no rust.  3) Complete and stick as in
NOT custom and cut.  3) Budget is $2500 to $3000 range.

What I need more than anything is you to find the deals in your area.  I am
also seeking occasional help as far as someone doing an in-person
inspection.

Robert and others:  Yes, I know that I'm being open about some of my finds.
I appreciate the warning.  However, I also am asking for public help and I
have to deal with the occasional person who takes advantage of the
situation.  I firmly believe that the help I am getting is worth that risk.
I have had good dealings with listees and know that there are great people
out there.

Thanks.
