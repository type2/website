Dear Listees-

This message is Maryland content, so please ignore if you don't live in the
area.  A new club is forming in Maryland for Type II action.  When I checked
to see if there was a local NEATO chapter in MD, Dave (Prez of NEATO) told
me the club folded due to inactivity.  I'd like to get it started up again.
Please p-mail me to let me know of the interest.

Thanks!

Paul
