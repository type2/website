I had this problem with my 71 a while back...took me a while to figure it
out.  Turned out (a few hundred miles after i put a new SPRUNG clutch in)
that the clutch and pressure plate were binding no matter what as the sprung
portion of the clutch disc stuck out too far and would bind with the pressure
plate.  I tried everything...but finally came to this.
Check your clutch cable tube.  Watch it as someone does the clutch....does it
move?  If so...this is your problem.  Any welds broken on the tube?
Again....a bad thing.  What about the cable?  Is it frayed?  Again....bad
How about your throwout arm inside the bellhousing?  Is one of the welds on
the arms busted allowing it to bend and not activate the pressure plate?  Bad
thing again...

Try these out....if you're problem is what I think it is...then one of these
is your problem.

Adios!

&gt;  Now, no
&gt; matter what I do, the bus is in gear.  Adjusted the clutch to no avail.
&gt; Wife stepped on the pedal and sure enough it's moving at the tranny.
&gt; What now?
