&lt;&lt; are you saying the rear wheel bearings wear quicker because of the American
rims and the funky adaptors for them, or because of the lack of reduction gear
boxes?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
The 1968 and later buses have two bearings on each axle and they wore out on
our 1970 due to the extra width of the wide tires and the adapters that moved
them farther out.   Eric &amp; Barb
