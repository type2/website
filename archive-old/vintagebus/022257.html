I guess I'm going though one of my &quot;be honest with yourself&quot; phases.
Here's the scoop-     I've had this bus for almost a year and haven't
gotten around to doing anything on it.  Tired of listening to my wife gripe
about it, and don't know when I'll ever honestly get the time to give it
the attention it deserves with all my other ongoing projects.  Might as
well sell it for what I've got in it.  Maybe one of you guys will have more
time than I do for it.  Here's the details:

1965 13 window Deluxe Microbus for sale: Good shape overall, frame good.
Rust around bottom sides and front.  New tires and some parts for
restoration, working 12v refrig. Good project. (Engine negotiable.) $800

Located In Chesapeake, Virginia

No engine in it presently, and I won't get one in it to take it to Manassas
for Bug-Out.
Please E-mail me directly or call please

(That hurt!!!)

'72 Super Beetle, '65 Microbus (for now)
