I can't speak for Australian buses, but VW Transporters sold in South
Africa were assembled here from CKD kits since August 1955.

I have never seen an m-code plate on SA-assembled buses. Locally assembled
VW Transporters have a VIN plate under the front passenger seat (LHS),
which includes model# and chassis# and max axle weights, but no colours or
options.

VWSA kept no records and cannot even tell you the year a vehicle was built
from the VIN#.

1957 Kombi (SA-assembled, original)
1963 Dormobile (Original Martin Walter Dormobile)
1967 Ambulance (needs resto)
1975 &quot;Fleetline&quot; panelvan, daily beater (Brazilian-made, SA-assembled,
12volt 1600DP, split-screen!)
1975 &quot;Fleetline&quot; Kombi, awaits engine and minor resto (same as above, but
bus with windows all round incl corners, but no skylights or sunroof, and
Kombi spec)
plus another two 1975 Fleetline buses and one panelvan, and a 1966
German-built SA-assembled panelvan, all in varying stages of decomposition.
