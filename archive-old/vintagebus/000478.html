 Next I moved up front to clean the terminals and replace the bulbs in the
 fried egg turnsignal lights.  These, too, also got new seals behind them.
 Removing the headlights revealed the little marker bulb on one side has had
 it's wires cut.  Thank goodness the passenger side light is still hooked up
 so I can trace the wires and see where it goes too.  Exactly what are these
 little bulbs supposed to do?  Are they for daytime running lights?

running lights- come one with headlight switch out halfway
.................
 I put the headlights back in because the buckets are going to require some
 thorough blasting a cleaning.  The paint is peeling and surface rust has
 settled in.  I suppose I could por15 them but would the black paint affect
 the lighting?  Maybe if anything it would act like a mirror?  Hmmmm....

if you repaint in there, best to paint it silver for the added reflective 
effect.

 Anyways, I moved on and replaced the switch on the steering pod that
 controls the dome lights.  When I pulled the cover off of the rear light, it
 snapped in half.  Damn!  The front one came off just fine.  After hitting
 K-Mart for some super glue to fix the domelight with (they don't carry round
 halogens!!!), we went to ALCO - another midwestern discount store chain and
 picked up 2 12v halogen headlamps for a &quot;2 headlight system.&quot;  Also, my
 efforts in finding a suitable 12v domelight bulb were futile.  I'm going to
 try the FLAPS tomorrow as they have a greater selection of bulbs.

halogen headlight are nice.  :)   make sure he dome lights you instal are the 
5W kind.  If you use 6V 5W or 12V 10W bulbs with a 12V system the will covers 
melt, you need the 12V5W bulbs.  Then again you can leave the covers off.  I 
have seen 12V10W bulbs in a variety of colours, for that mood light thang.
 ............
 That was about as much as I was able to get done.  I'm going to have to pull
 the speedo as the little color things have fallen off and it needs new ones.
 I haven't decided whether to go stock or replace them with some funky
 colors. :-)  Any suggestions for removing the speedo?  I've done it before
 on junk buses but I didn't have to remember where the wires went.  Maybe I
 need to pull the parcel tray to make it easier?

 Oh and yeah - where do I get 12v indicator bulbs for the speedo?  Are they
 the same as the bulbs for bug speedos?
 -- - -  
same as bug speedos yes, even 70s bugs.

 That was about it.  Thanks for reading...
