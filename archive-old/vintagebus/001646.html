the main problem I see with that idea is POR15 is useless unless you can
make metal to hand contact before putting it on. otherwise its pointless and
will come off eventually. have to somewhat touch the metal and remove the
loose rust and scales (which im sure there is plenty in those gates) and
they also say to clean it with  somethin to remove dirt/grease/excess rust
or it will be a no-go.
Thats what I cried to the POR15 dealer about, cause I wanted to just get
under my bus and shoot the whole undercarriage with the stuff without goin
over every square inch of the metal :(

&gt; And for you S/C &amp; D/C owner, or any one who has done
&gt;sumthin similar... Gonna cut the rust outa the gates
&gt;this weekend &amp; start on them. Tryin to find the best
&gt;way to get the POR-15 down in the channels to protect
&gt;from this happenin again. Only way I see to is to take
&gt;the gate off, put a funnel in it &amp; fill it up:) Messy,
&gt;but doable...ideas?
&gt;Thanks for any help,
