Hey busnuts!

Sorry if this has already been announced, I have been quick on the
delete button, so I haven't read every thread...

I just stopped by the little vw shop where I used to work this morning,
and man did I get a treat! The Dealer's parts guy came by with a stack
of the new VW Dealer Calendars, in two flavors... first was the VW
motorsports calendar, with some funny waterbugs all hopped up, the usual
jettas, golfs, and a few non-us models like the Lupo and such, all at
the races. Cool...

But really cool was the other flavor calendar: Historical Volkswagen
Vehicles. Mostly oval and later bugs, a ghia, but THREE splitties as
well. January is a nice 23, a real looker from a distance, although the
concourse judge in me saw a couple small problems, still nicer than any
I own. November is a nice standard, 1964, ( could be a kombi with
headliner installed?) and then the coup de gras ( coup de wolfsburg?) is
August, a very very nice 52 deluxe...with semaphores a blazing, in
chestnut and sealing wax... one sweet bus... Andrew Kliemm is the owner,
in Orange Calif. Hope he keeps it locked up, beacuse otherwise I may be
needing that vin plate Kos...:)

Also cool is the little vw dates in history marked on the calendar: Aug
5, 1955, The one-millionth VW is produced. 

So race down to your local dealer and get yourself one or two.
