Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/pressure plate locked together

Hi Scott,
We never have had that problem unless the clutch disc was getting just enough 
oil on it to cause it to suction to the FW and/or pressure plate, but not 
slip.  We score some radial lines in the FW and pressure plate faces to 
prevent this suction.  Best to dissassemble and inspect for the cause.
