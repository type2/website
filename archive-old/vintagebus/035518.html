Hi Rocky,
Definitely using the magnetic stuff that bussinesses use for signs on thier 
autos is a great idea.  That way during the summer if the vent area is not 
covered by a cabinet one can remove the magnetic panels and increase fresh 
air flow through the panel bus.  If there is going to be a cabinet installed 
so as not to allow you access to the vent area it might be a good idea to 
lightly paint the inner sheet metal of this vent befor installing the 
magnetic panel.  Otherwise water may collect there and go unnoticed too long 
causing a nasty rust problem later.   Eric&amp;Barb
