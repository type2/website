Hi-

I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine. Although it
seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable when cold due
to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each gear.  I was
told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a new 009
distributor.

Recognizing my limitations, I took the bus in to a local VW repair shop to
both check everything out and to try to cure the problem.  They tuned the
engine (points, plugs, etc.), checked the compression (140-145), adjusted
the valves, dwell and timing without a noticable change in the problem.  I
was also told the did a vacuum check that proved satisfactory.

After messing around with the existing carb, they decided it must be the
culprit, and installed a brand new carb of the same type.  No change in the
symptoms.  At this point they tried to re-jet the new carb which apparently
did not significantly change the symptoms.  (Note: at this point the
diagnosis was that it wasn't getting enough gas since it seemed to run
better with the choke fully on.)  Finally, they installed a third (this
time rebuilt) carb which seems to have provided about 80% symptomatic
relief - but there is still a significant sort of flat spot at the low end
of each gear.

Ideas?  Since I plan to use the bus for short trips around the local area,
I really would like it to run well in the start and stop mode.

Appreciate any help/suggstions.
