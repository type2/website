Volks,
  I haven't posted to the list in a while, I've been *really* busy with a
new job. This weekend I finally got to take some time off and spend some
time with a few buses and a few great bus folks!

  On friday afternoon my '60 Westy returned from the Archdale, NC shop of
Kelly &quot;The Metalwizard&quot; Brown. He and Neil Pickett were kind enough to
bring her back to me on the way to pick up Kelly's new '67 Westy from Dave
here in Nashville. After much crawling in and on and around the bus, and a
liberal application of primer, I must say I'm thrilled with the progress
she's made. There's still a long way to go, but we're off to a really nice
start. Hopefully I'll have some pictures to post soon.

  After I got done rubbing up against my bus, we went to Dave's house to
pick up Kelly's. Then we met up with Scott and Tim, ate some dinner, and
spent the rest of the evening fawning over Tim's cherry '67 Westy with some
waay cool accessories. The original owner was apparently some kind of
documentation freak because he still has every manual for everything in or
on the bus.

  We got up pretty early and met Dave, Scott and Scott's wife Tree (and
their really nice '67 Westy) for breakfast and a trip to Scott's storage
unit to pull Neil's transmission from Scott's '56 23-window
resto-in-progress. With that accomplished, Scott and Neil ducked around the
corner of the building to relieve themselves, glanced up the hill behind
the storage place, and spotted several old buses up in the woods! Needless
to say, it didn't take us long to go over the fence and make our way up the
hill. We were greeted with the remains of at least 3 splitties, a bay, and
a bunch of beetles. They had all been there quite some time and were pretty
thoroughly rotten, and fairly well picked over, but we did score a few
decent parts. Shortly thereafter Neil and Kelly hit the road, and I went
home for a much needed nap.

Today I spent most of the afternoon communing with my bus. She seems much
happier now that she's got all that new metal. Next stop, after some
financial recovery: the paint and body guys!  (Can anybody recommend a good
paint and body place in or around Middle Tennessee?)
