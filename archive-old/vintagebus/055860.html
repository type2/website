Subject: Re: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

I guess this makes sense. Afterall, the Germans painted the trans and left
the engine case bare. Maybe they knew something?

&gt; Paint can make a great insulator, keeping heat in, instead of letting the
&gt; bare metal radiate it to the cooling air. Now if this was a water cooled
&gt; block, I wouldn't have any qualms over painting it. The Transaxle is
another
&gt; entirely different thing, I paint them!
