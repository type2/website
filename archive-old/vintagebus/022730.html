&gt;         I thought I proofread my message pretty well.  However I overlooked 
&gt;one thing and that is the DATE for Buses at the Beach.  Sorry guys. It is 
&gt;April 8th &amp; 9th.  So can anybody tell I'm a newbie yet?Thank You Again 
&gt;Jerry.

At that rate, I might as well point out that the date for the Kelley Park
Vintage Meet here in San Jose is set for April 9th at the San Jose
Historical Museum.  Early word is that we will once again only have one
gate for everyone to get in thru, but if that changes, I'll letcha all know.
