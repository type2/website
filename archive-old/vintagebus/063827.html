Subject: Re: Transmisson Seal

	Hello all knowing list :-) does someone out there know what it
takes to remove a rear main seal in a tranny? The one next to the throw
out bearing I believe that mine is shot and is in need of replacing. I
just put in a new engine this weekend and it is as clean as can be but I
have a dark brown puddle under my bus and it is coming from between the
engine and the tranny. With brand new oil in the engine I am pretty sure
it is not coming from there. I am bummed because I spent this weekend
replacing this engine to find that my tranny is leaking too.


Please help oil leaks suck!
