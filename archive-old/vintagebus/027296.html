Subject: looking for a restorer

Does anyone have any good recommendations for restorers in the northern
(Maine, Mass., Conn., VT, NH) New England area? I will not be in need of
my 73 for close to a year and would like to get it back into daily
driver condition after many years of love and use. But... would like
someone able to do custom body work also.
