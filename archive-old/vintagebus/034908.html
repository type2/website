Only 2 busses?  How do you do it?  I seem to always have three or more 
running and insured, plus my 1955 Ch_at_vy and trailer to haul in more!  How can 
one survive with less than a Panel, a Double cab, and a Westy or two?  That 
reminds me, I've got to get going on a nine passenger, so I can haul all my 
friends around.
