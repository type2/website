Subject: Re: [VB] deluxe bumper trim install help
To: mjhenks_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;&lt; Are there any tip's out there for installing the
 rubber trim in the aluminum on the bumpers.  I have
 tried prying it and using WD-40 to lub it.  any
 methods to this that anyone can share?
 
 I have not had any luck yet.   How long should i expect to take to do them? 
&gt;&gt;

All the rubber has to be carved, shaped, filed and sanded before 
installation.  Each piece is different - don't assume Left rear and Right 
rear are the same length for example, BTDT.  Only &quot;lubricant&quot; needed is elbow 
grease and lots of it.  I used a screw driver to help push it in.  I have 
done two complete set for some Deluxes I had a few years back.  Takes the 
better part of an hour per trim piece including the shaping.  Oh, the trim 
mounts to the bumper first, then the rubber insert goes in.  Don't forget the 
part.  8-)
