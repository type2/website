Subject: Re: [VB] link pin dust caps

I just did this...had a bit of trouble on one of them.
I took it out, and used the metric scale to measure
diameter, and figure out where it was out of round,
then used a pair of channel locks with gentle pressure
to bend it back into shape. Then I put it in--
When installing there's basically two ways you can go
about it: 

1) (the bad way) bang in one side, so it's crooked,
then pound in the edge that's still sticking out, and
hope it goes in without getting mangled. this worked
on the first one, but is how i bent up the second.

2) The better way is to put in one edge, so it's just
barely in there, THEN pound in the edge that's still
sticking out.  That way there's never as much of an
angle on the thing. 

hope that helps! The main factor that got mine in
successfully was patience and care. Never try rotating
the thing! It will only cut a deep groove in your cap.

PS: mine was on a '61....from what i understand
they're different in '64....not sure if it would
matter though.
