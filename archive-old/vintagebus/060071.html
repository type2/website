Subject: RE: [VB] Bus is hot need help

No, it is fully advanced at that speed, and remains the same at all
higher rpms.
009s seems to have all dirrefent behaviors.
I am going back to vac dizzy 205t.

One question....if your advace is all in by 2600 rpm would it advance
more
if the rpms climbed into 3k rpms?  Just curious.
