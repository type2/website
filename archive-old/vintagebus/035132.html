Here is an easy question for those of you who have done it before... I have a
stack of worn deluxe trim and would like to polish it myself.  I tried the
steel wool on a fewe pieces but it doesn't shine as much as pieces I've seen
around.( I don't own a large buffing wheel ) What yields the best results?
Also If anyone knows of a pair of early front bumper trim pieces I've got a
pocket full of cash for a trade. Thanks Trevor
