snip&gt;&gt;&gt; A real suggestion... Check for brake/bearing drag. Had a brake
adjustment problem in my Thing earlier this year, oil was 240 and climbing
before I realized the brakes were dragging at 65 mph, flat terrain, 74f
ambient. Air in the lines and too much scrape.&gt;&gt;&gt;snip-n-more

If the brakes are dragging much the drums will get HOT! I occasionally
take a stroll around and put a hand on the wheels just as a little brake
check out.
