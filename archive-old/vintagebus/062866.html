Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes 

  The whole talk started when the seller is asking a high price for
something, then refuses to furnish the necessary info to an interested party
to warrant the price they were/are asking. There has been no price beating,
just info wanting. In 3 different instances the sellers were not interested
in furnishing anymore info, letting a third party check it out and in one
instance even answering any more questions. I think that if somebody is
going to sell something (especially at a high price) they should bend over
backwards to supply the necessary info to complete the sale. 
  

ronnie  if your going to sell something then work at selling it.

Hi Sean,
Your reply is well put.  In a free enterprise system, a buyer can change
whatever he wants for his goods or services.  It's the buyers right to pass
if he doesn't like the price.  If enough people pass, perhaps the seller
will realize that he is asking too much, and lower his price.

Ed
