I have a 65 DC and I just tore down the front wheels. After sorting out the
brakes I put the whole thing back together. My question is about how to
tighten the nuts. How tight should they be? I tightened and loosened the
inner nut a bunch of times to seat the bearings and make sure the reading
was accurate but im not sure how much play I need. I was grabbing the drum
and push/pulling at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock until I have almost no movement.
The wheel seems to turn rather sluggishly now though. However if I loosen
the nut just a hair then the play seems too much. Any tips???  I had a wheel
come off on me while driving some time ago and ever since I try to be VERY
thorough with wheels :)
Thanks for the help!
TJ
