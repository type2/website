Subject: Re: [VB] shifting in to 3rd &amp; 4th very hard

yes, the bumper could be pushing the works out of line, and messing it up.   try removing the bumper and see if it gets better.   If it does, you can choose whether to ditch the muffler, leave the bumper off and put spikes on the rear of the bus instead, chop a hole in the bumper, or put a muffler that'll fit on.

(I like the idea of the spikes)

if this doesn't change anything, try adjusting the shifter plate up front.   I had a wierd thing happen when suddenly one day it was hard to shift into 1st/2nd... i mean hard to find them.  I reajusted the front plate and everything was fine.

hope this helps

&gt; I tried to embark on a road trip on sat when I found myself unable to shift into 3rd &amp; 4th easily.  After replacing the front shift bushing a month or two ago, the bus has been shifting like a dream.  I couldn't see anything wrong with the front shift bushing.   The only thing I did prior to this problem was put on a new rear bumper.  The bumper required alot of work to get on because of my empi single quiet pack hanging out ( i will go to stock exhaust one of these days.. ) and the bumper is putting a lot of upwards and forwards torque on the engine due to the fact that it is pushing on the exhaust.   Is it likely that this is pushing the tranny just enough to 
&gt; bind the hock stick connector on the rear shift rod?
