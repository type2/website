&lt;&lt; Next I pulled the Sapphire radio out of the dash and hooked it up via a 
resistor drop to a 12v battery I had in the garage.  I assumed the end with 
the fuse was the hot lead but could only get the radio to come on when I used 
the negative lead on the fused wire. &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
NO.......  When in doubt with electrics ground the chassi/body of the item, 
and apply positive to the wires!  Here is the wire ID for Saffire radios.  
One for the positive to the radio.  One for the positive for the interior 
light of the radio.  And two that should be together for the speaker.
