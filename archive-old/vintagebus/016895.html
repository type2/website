My plan (Real Soon Now) is to get one of those red LED third-light
units, a 6-to-12 converter, and mount it along the bottom of the rear
window.  Considering that LEDs really only need 1.2 volts to operate,
I may be able to rewire it to work on six instead of 12 directly,
which would be even better.  The hard part is figuring out how to run
the wires (don't want long lines, don't want to cut holes, etc).
