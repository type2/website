Good Job and feel proud most ladies would never attempt to do that ,,pulling a
trailer with your ,or some else's pride and joy on it is more stressful than
most think,(hint ,,trailers are for boats ,,and trip reports it was on a
trailer not good ),,,if i rember correcty less than a year ago some people
lost a bus to a accident involving a bus which was on a trailer in my area
,,some one was transporting it home for them or something ,,can't rember all
the details but i met them at a campout this summer ,,it was a bad deal ,,i
won't bore everyone with details but last month ,,i transported a 58 Deluxe
Hardtop ,back to my shop on a trailer from Asheville NC,belonging to NPBUSGUY
,,thats his baby ,,i removed the upolstery of my raggedy fo** front seat,,from
my skinny butt  when i pulled in my driveway and i been building trailers and
pulling them for over 20 years,,,In a nutshell ,,i tip my hat to the lady and
say job well done be proud ,,i myself enjoyed reading it ,,later Kelly
