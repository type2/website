&gt; &gt;Hi everybody,
&gt; &gt;  I have been looking for a set of hoops for my 57 singlecab and none are
&gt; &gt;to be found
&gt;
&gt;  The guy that Dawn reccomended me 2 years ago, stopped makin them and i got
&gt; his last set. Vintage warehouse was makin them but they updated their
&gt; website saying no longer doin it.

I bought a bunch of them from Derrick when he was making them and I sold them
all so when he said he was going to stop I put in my order early for the
discounted price break. I know of no one else making hoops that look as nice or
close to original as his. That's why I'm keeping the few sets I have left for my
own kits. I stopped making the tilts for the general population due the the time
involved. When I saw Dawn was making them I figured I'd pass the torch (and the
hassles) on to someone else. I kept enough material and hardware for 5-6
canvases depending on Crew or Single and the very expensive hardware tool I
bought while I was doing them. With all that I should be covered for awhile. If
you're not looking for originality but function the hoops are very easy to make
and I have seen many different styles. If you still need dimensions let me know
and I can get them for you.
