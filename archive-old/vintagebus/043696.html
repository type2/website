&gt;I'm not sure what you mean here.  I thought it came in on both sides.

&gt;Nope. On a 1600, it comes in from the passenger side and exits on the
&gt;drivers side.  [...] The gaskets tell the tale:

&gt;
&gt;Nope.  If you look at a good stock muffler you will see that one side is
&gt;an inlet...that is, into the heat risers, and the other an outlet.

I stand corrected.  A careful re-reading of Muir also shows that that
the heat risers can't be dead ends - you are supposed to be able to
blow all the way through both of them.  On the exhaust I have on the
Bus right now ('64 Bus with '68 Beetle 1500) the right heat riser
connection is that tube that snakes around the main exhaust pipe 
flange on the right side, and the left heat riser connection is cast
into the main exhaust pipe flange on the left side.  I remember the
gaskets with two different holes and now I'm wondering if I got them
in the correct places.

The right (passenger) side was the one that was coked up - however 
this was also with an extractor-type exhaust; when I cleaned out
the heat riser I also changed out the muffler for a stock Bus muffler
(but I think for a later Bus as the tail pipe comes out on the right
(wrong) side).

Thanks for the correction!
