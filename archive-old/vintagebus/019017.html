&gt; Hi Ken, 
&gt; 
&gt; 	How did you find this book?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Did you just do a genereic Web search?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I was curious, since I'm always looking for VW literature.


roger, i really don't remember... 



&gt; 
&gt; 	BTW, if you are looking for Early VW reapair manuals, you 
&gt; will need
&gt; to get the real VW workshop manuals.  I believe, for your 
&gt; application, it
&gt; would be the 1959 manual with the updates to at least 1961.  Though, 
&gt; I heard
&gt; that Robert Bently, **might** be puting these earlier manuals on 
&gt; CD-ROM, 

that would be grand but a book would be better

&gt; that's just a rumour, I would call them up to find out.

Talk to the king of books hisself?
scary...
thanks for the info.

Aloha
Ken
