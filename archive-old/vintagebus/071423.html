Subject: Re: [VB] new (old) engine

Glad to see somebody's reading on a Saturday nite :).
Guessing endplay, are we ? .004 is good,
your technique sucks:) Replace that $2 rear main seal.
Does your mechanic friend have a plan for keeping
your passengers breathing adequately:)?!
$1500? There is a fair amount of change if you build your own:).
That last $450 would have just about done it :)

&gt; Hey Dave Wolfanger,
&gt; It's a cash flow thang. You know, wish I had around $1500+. Could get what
I
&gt; really want. Instead, I'll have to be patient with having a poor old
engine.
&gt; Kind of an old volks home geriatric engine. Now I have an extra engine
&gt; though that I can use to keep the bus going while I tear down the knocker.
&gt; Once the knocker engine is rebuilt, I can then rebuild the Ghia engine. I
am
&gt; far from half way towards a bottom end at this point. The end play is
&gt; minimal. The jiggle would be maybe .004 I'm guessing. I should mic it to
&gt; find out for sure. What are the specs, I remember reading it somewhere.
Was
&gt; it in The Muir Idiot book? Thanks for the heads up on main bearing wiggle
&gt; idea. A mechanic friend of mine advises against stock bus muffler for dual
&gt; ports. He said they keep the engines from breathing adequately. I'll bet
&gt; there are some strongly held opinions on this issue. In your post, what
does
&gt; &quot;HIOP&quot; mean?
