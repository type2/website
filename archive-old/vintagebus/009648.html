:I've recently become the new owner of an early 62 crewcab (bullets/small
:taillights). I havn't checked for fit (yet) but do any of you gurus know if
:the front bech seat backrest/bottom are interchangable with the rears? IE:
:will the new upholstery for the fronts fit the rear as well?



Backrest maybe. Seat cushion, no. The rear seat cushion has a section in the middle front that drops down about 3 in. from the rest of the frame. The front doesn't have this. Just try swapping the backrests, that will tell the story there.
