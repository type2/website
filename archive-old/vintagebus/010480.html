I'm on a search for some parts for my neighbor so that he can finish putting
together his '61 23 window.

Looking for

1. shims - used in the steering king/link to adjust the camber.  Quantity:
enough to do one side
2. rubber seals/bushings to cover the same shims.
3. German bus nose cone

It would be ideal if the rubber seals were new, the other parts can be new
or used as long as in good condition.

Thanks,

Scott
