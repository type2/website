Sweet Jesus on Toast!

GL-4 Tranny Oil Thread, Lowered Buses, and the ol' 34PICT3/009 Combo 
Thread.....all in the same day!

1. Use GL-4 or your tranny will whine and scream until it finally grenades 
into millions of pieces of shrapnel, ripping through the floor of your bus and 
making the interior smell like sulfurous gear oil.

2. Lowered buses look kewl but ride like chit.

3. To hell with the 009...if you want centrifugal advance, then do it right 
and run a olde skool 010.  I ran one on my old 1600 DP with a 34PICT3.  Gas 
mileage sucked until I plugged the hole in the butterfly.  My mileage then jumped 
up to 50mpg, and 15 extra horses to boot! YMMV.  That motor is currently on 
my garage floor waiting for a top end rebuild.

4.  What kind of tires/oil/ scoops should I put on my bus?

5.  Where can I find a killer deal on a Dasher diesel?
