The &quot;L311&quot; and the &quot;L312&quot; are colors that were only popular for about 3
years and were dropped from the line.  The Glasurit archives back east
have some of the early paint formulas that local paint distributors do not
have.  I don't have a ph.# for the archives, but your distributor should
and could call for you.
The match your painter is talking about comes about after an origianl
piece of sheet metal with a good glossy coat of the color you want is
still there to be scanned by a special type of computer which will develop
a paint formula to reproduce said color.  This system isn't always that
perfect.
I wanted a formula developed for a dark maroon (early Kabrio only color)
the formula produced and then mixed turned out totally ugly and not even
close!
What you're trying to do is going to be next to impossible at best.
But good luck.
