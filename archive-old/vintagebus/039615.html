&gt;always leak.  If you dont live in so cal or the desert SW, you do have a
&gt;sheltered place to park it?   They always leak. My 61 has OG safaris.  NOS
&gt;seals work good - they barely leaked for the first couple years.
&gt;


What we need is a repo that is not like the old design. I remember my 64 
bugs sliding roof. It was made to leak. And then collect that water and drip 
it out the bottom of the car.
So what the safaris need is some sort of water collection collar that moves 
the water down and drips it out the front and down off the bus. Shouldnt be 
that hard to design, and although it is not vintage, I think people would 
like it. Our wing windows have a chrome strip for this reason, so why not 
safaris?
