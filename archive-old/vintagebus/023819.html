I struck a deal on the bus today for $1300.  I looked at quite a few and
just never found an original example this straight -- top, sides front
and back very, very straight. It looks like body repair will focus on
the front seat belt anchor points which were both detached.  The sliding
door has a jalosie &lt;sp&gt;? window which works fine. Could this be original
or is it probably after-market?  The bumpers do not have overriders (and
don't look like any parts are missing) -- should they?  Steering box
makes a &quot;click&quot; sound when the steering wheel is centered and gently
moved back and forth over the freeplay range.  I didn't feel any
negative effects when I drove it, but I never took it on the freeway. 
Anyway, I'm really excited but still have some of those &quot;did I make the
right choice?&quot; feelings.

I'm going to draw up a game plan for the restoration next week. 
Tomorrow I'll be at the Pomona swap meet looking for a rear license
plate light fixture and a cheap rear bumper (the existing one is
slightly bowed in at the center).  I also hope to peg the value of a
comparable bus in &quot;driver restoration&quot; condition.

I've already drawn a lot of valuable information from the group and plan
to continue doing so as my project progresses.  As always, any feedback
is appreciated.

&gt; The seller is asking $1600 and my questions to the group are 1)whether
&gt; this seems like a fair price, and 2)if there is anything in particular I
&gt; should be concerned about because this is the first year of the &quot;late
&gt; bus&quot;.  All input is greatly appreciated.
