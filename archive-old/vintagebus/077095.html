Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums...

 yep... thats what gave me the inspiration to build my
own:) Its aint pretty by any means.... but it works
like a champ...
 It started life as a sheet of 13/64 plate... you have
to remember, this was built outa scrap metal laying
around... anyway, made two disks, 10in OD/8 1/4in ID
and the other 6in OD /18mm ID... placed an old drum on
the larger disk, dykemed the bolt pattern, and drilled
5 18mm holes fer the lug bolts... the smaller one got
a 18mm hole drilled right in the middle. Then cut 5
pieces of 1 in x .250 wall round tube at 30 degrees?
opposite from each other ( been along time) and
started welding...after building the &quot;Devo looking
hat&quot;, welded a 5/8in nut on top of the smaller disc
for the 6in bolt... after 2 weeks of
heating/beating/cussing this drum on the SC, I walked
outa the shop, puller still warm from welding... and
had the drum off in 5 minutes...:) I was not going to
tackel it with a grinder &amp; drill motor....
 Heck... anyone need to borrow it... have spent way
more money helpin folks that found me on the AIRS list
than it would cost shippin this thing from coast to
coast... tell ya what... Ill get it to ya, you just
get it back to me... it wont be like the hubcap
relay... but you still gotta sign it and/or send a pic
back with ya using it... and if it breaks, well, just
got to build a better mouse trap... err... puller...
