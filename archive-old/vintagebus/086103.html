Subject: Re: [VB] Firewall between tank and engine on a split?

It's funny how people do things differently in different countries.  In 
the UK we don't really have a culture of &quot;filling it up&quot; and our gas 
pump don't even have the facility to be left running with the nozzle in 
the filler.  You have to be there and keep your finger on the trigger 
until you've finished.  I remember driving through AZ some years ago and 
ask a petrol pump guy to put $5 in - we got a funny look of him ; )

I would agree that draining the overflow is probably safer than 
enclosing the tank and I would still not tend to fill it up as you don't 
always know the condition of the rubber filler neck.  I know gas is 
cheap over there, but I always only fill the tank half way  so that I'm 
not carrying so much weight around

&gt; So, my sister-in-law bought a '70 bus (I might forgive her someday).  I was
&gt; checking it out and noticed the firewall between the gas tank and the
&gt; engine... then started pondering how that might work in my '63 panel/camper.
