Tonight in Reno, we had our first ‘club’ event to feel
out what kind of interest there might be to go forward
with an official Air Cooled/All VW’s (?)group. While
expecting only about five or six people to show, which
would have been a good turnout, we ended up with
SEVENTEEN very enthusiastic VW’s people.
While we had a great time over Pizza &amp; Beer trying to
decide on a direction and a name, the best part was
the mini VW car show in the parking lot. WOW, where
did all of the great VW’s come from. There were five
Split Type II’s.  We are looking to make a showing
later this month at the Sacramento-Bug-O-Rama. I would
like to get any info/help from anyone with experience
organizing a new club.
So if anyone out there in the Digest would like to get
together in Reno, please call or e-mail us, we would
like to get an event together for Hot August Night.
More to follow on the new VW group of Northern Nevada.
Thanks for fellow founders Jim Becker and Steve
Hansen.
