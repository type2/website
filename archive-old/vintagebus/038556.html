Hi Volks,

Been inspecting my new camper 8 ^)  and making a list of the work to be done
and my wish list.  Being new to the Westy group I'm learning a lot and
finding out how much I need to learn.  The camper came to me with worn
Elephant Ear mirrors.  I learned that these were a custom option that
replaced the round mirrors from the stock kombi (right?).  I also found
holes and screws left from the mounting of truck mirrors (top of windwing
frame and just below belt line).  So I'm wondering if the truck mirrors were
mounted first and replaced with the elephant ones.  So my question is......
were the truck mirrors a custom add on from Westfalia or a PO
thing............?  Looking at the Malamut Collection in the July issue of
Hot VW's, his '67 Westy has the truck mirrors.  Anyone know the story?  I
like the truck mirrors the best because of there safety on the hyway so is
there a correct set or just look for ones I like and will fit?  I'd like an
orginal reflection (sorry).

Thanks,
John

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
