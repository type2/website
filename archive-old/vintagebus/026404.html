Jack,

BTDT.  Had a '66 TR-4.  Supercharged.  Used a Spearco water injection
system to cool the intake charge and control detonation.  Worked fine.
Made it so that I didn't have to run a retarding distributor to cure the
'pinging' caused by 15 psi boost.  Common solution for high compression
caused detonation.  Probably been a BUNCH of S.A.E. papers written on
the subject.  Used during WWII on fighter aircraft for the same
reasons.  If you want a bunch of technical stuff about it, let me know
and I'll see what I've got in my library.  (I know that I've got the
instructions that came with the Spearco set-up. Saw it about a week
ago.)  BTW, the Spearco system consisted of a windshield washer bottle
and pump with a few different sized jets and assorted bracketry to
position them in the carb throat.  Also had a vacuum/pressure switch to
sense boost conditions.  Was necessary because the Judson Supercharger
was a 'vane' type blower.  Vane type blowers have plastic 'vanes' that
ride against the blower housing.  These require lubrication.  Hence,
there was an oil misting system to inject a small quantity of oil into
the intake mixture.  This lowered the octane rating of the fuel and
promoted detonation.  Cooling the intake charge retarded the onset of
it.  Adding supercharging to a motor that already had a 9.5:1
compression ratio made lots (read: LOTS) of heat!  Compression pressures
of around 250-290 psi while boosted.  I learned a lot with that car.
(And it was still alive when I sold it. Had to replace the trans about
every 5k miles though.)

Jim
