Subject: Re: [VB] Fitting a bay bus middle seat

Bob Thomas wrote:

&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; In my 67 std walk-through bus, I do not have a middle seat.  It seems very
&gt; hard to find a 2/3 seat, at least one I can afford.  It seems like alot of
&gt; people put in a Bay middle seat, but when I tried to fit one during a swap
&gt; meet, the mounts on the floor do not meet the brackets on the seat.  Is
&gt; there the particular year of a bay window bus I need to be looking for?
&gt;
&gt; Or are their special brackets that are used when using a bay window seat?
&gt;
&gt; As always
&gt; any help would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; thanks a lot
&gt;
&gt; Bob

FWIW,
I just acquired a center seat in a trade for some non Bus stuff. I believe it
is from a '63- I don't really know, as I am not a Bus with seats kind of guy.
I like commercial Buses.

P-mail me if you want more info.
