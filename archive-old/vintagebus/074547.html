Subject: POR15 thoughts/opinions

Any thoughts on this product? I know some are going to tell me it is the
greatest thing since sliced bread...and that may be the case.
 First, what kind of surface prep is required of a rusty spot you want to
POR? I have heard you should just POR right over the rust with only minimal
rust removal prior to PORing. Is it necessary to take it down to bare metal?

Secondly, once your surface has been PORed will primer adhere to it or do we
need to sand the PORed area to provide a better surface for the primer to
adhere to?
Thirdly, can POR over a painted, non-rusted piece to preserve it?

Thanks in advance,
Scott
