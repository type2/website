Now this tops it all! I'm in a ranting kind of mood today. You don't see
ACVW's on our roads often you know but what's been following me around
lately is something out of this world. Listen to this. I went by a Wall-Mart
today without even stooping since I was a bit pressed on time but I had to
go to Menards, for those that don't know this is a &quot;Home Improvement Center&quot;
store (drywall, nuts and bolts, lumber, tools etc, etc.) and guess what???
they have this display right before you hit the cash registers with all
kinds of car and truck models, plastic and die cast, small and large. I
scored a very nice 1960 1:43 model of Ghia there the other day. Now today I
look at this rack and there it is!!!!!! a beautiful 1962 VW Microbus, red
over white. Now we can discuss the color combinations on these babies but
this one is something else. It's made by some company called &quot;Yat Ming&quot; from
Korea. It's pretty big (1:18 scale) and very beautifully detailed. Mirror
driver's side, bullet turn signals, rear hatch, sunroof cover, wipers, door
panels, hinges and even all the inside with working steering wheel that
turns wheels, dashboard, pedals, e-brake lever, shifter and all the seats.
All original coloring. Hey! it even has a deluxe clock and grab handle.
Underbody is detailed as well, Engine, muffler, tranny, heat exchangers and
the heat pipe that goes all the way to the front. Even front and rear
suspension resembles the original product. The only thing wrong with it is
that it's a deluxe with only 11 windows - missing two back windows, like a
Kombi. Well, I got two of them and sure enough I'll be looking for more in
the very near future.

So you can see that you can spot these practically anywhere.

Enough of this. I went on like that just because we don't see too many of
these on the roads around here. Stores? looks like it's a different story.
I've been finding Busses everywhere, Saturday I'm going to OKC to pick up my
new Bus a 65 - what model? dunno yet.
Thanks for letting me went a bit. I feel even better now.
