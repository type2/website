The one with the extended gear is the 1300-1600, (1300 European, not American,
some still used the older style until 1500), and the small gear is for sure 40
hp but prob also 25/36 hp. Maybe Dave knows if there was a further difference
in the early distributor drive shafts. I also found that my local hardware
store, Tacoma Screw, has proper size washers for the two shims. I had taken in
two and they mic'd them and sold me a dozen. for a buck.

All,

Here are two distributor drive shafts I recently picked up
http://members.cox_dot_net/mattroberds/shafts.jpg and I'm trying to figure
out what I have.  They look remarkably like the picture on page M-9 2
of the '50-'62 Bentley; the one on the left is an earlier style and
the one on the right is the later style.  Is this accurate?
