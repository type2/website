Subject: Re: [VB] New project for me (61DC)

&gt; Over all the bus is in good shape.  It is 95%
&gt; complete.  Solid gates and not too much rust.  (More
&gt; then i have ever tackled though)  The goal is to get
&gt; all the rust repaired, sand blast it, do the body work
&gt; and leave it in primer.

Not a good plan. Primer is &quot;not&quot; a waterproof product. It is designed to be
sprayed immediately before the final coats of &quot;waterproof&quot; paint are
applied. If you leave your truck unprimered for very long, moisture will
seep into the primer and ruin all that bodywork.

&gt; The worst parts of it are:
&gt; -  Driver door is shot.  Rusty and bowed
&gt; -  Passenger door rusty but i think repairable
&gt; -  Front lower 3&quot; of nose rusted away
&gt; -  ding in nose from over rider contact
&gt; -  Some rocker rust under 3rd door
&gt; -  Rear heater tube cross support gone
&gt; -  Many extra holes in cab area
&gt; -  Some extra non-factory ripples in the bed

Did you say this bus was 95% complete (?)
