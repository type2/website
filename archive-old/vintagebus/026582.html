I know its not Friday, but Christmas is an exception...no?

I received the Keith Seume book this morning and was thrilled.   I
didn't have this one yet...whoo hoo!  Even better was the fact that I
finally made it into print.  On page 30 in the wide shot of people
looking at the Hamill movie bus. I'm the only one not looking at the
movie.  I think a BD deluxe drew my attention ;-)  I'm the tall white
guy. The one in the hat and in profile.  This was at the SO#O event two
years ago down at Long Beach Veterans.

Momma always said I'd be in pictures some day.

MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone!!!!


Steve
