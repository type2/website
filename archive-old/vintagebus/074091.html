Subject: Nipping Off For a Bit

Hey all,

Wife and I are off to Dizzyland for the next week and so I'm going to unsub 
while we're out of town.  If anyone needs to reach me, email me direct and 
I'll try to check while we're gone.  And if anything important comes up 
regarding Rivieras, could someone forward that stuff to me as well?

Sorry for the use of bandwith, but y'all have a good week!
-Taylor
