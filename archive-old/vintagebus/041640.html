&gt; George,

&gt; When the busses get fewer and further 'tween, you might change your mind.
&gt; 
&gt; I too have had the problem of one person trying to out bid the other, but I
&gt; am true to my word and the first serious person gets first refuseal within
&gt; a reasonable amount of time.

The problem here is in discerning a &quot;serious&quot; person.  I've had a lot of
people who talk the talk, make a verbal deal, and are never heard from
again. If a person is known to me I would be a lot more prone to take the
bus off the market for them to take a look at it.

&gt; If everyone did business as you do, I wouldn't have half the busses that I
&gt; do.  Some of the busses that I have brought home came from as far away as
&gt; 800-1000 miles and the transaction happened over many days.
&gt; 
&gt; If I have found a bus that I would really like but is a distance away and
&gt; the seller says &quot;first money buys&quot;, I am REALLY STRESSED because there is
&gt; no way I can get any money to them any sooner than over night.  This way of
&gt; doing business doesn't relieve stress, it adds to it!!

The buyer is definitely under pressure to complete the deal.  The seller
is the one who is under less pressure in a &quot;first money&quot; situation.  Since
it is the seller that has the &quot;rare&quot; object, it behooves the buyer to act
as rapidly as possible.

The original topic of this thread was the ethics of someone selling a bus
after it had already been verbally promised to another buyer.  If the
seller wishes to operate under this basis, then the seller should be
honest enough to tell all buyers that the vehicle goes to the first person
who comes up with the cash.

Keep in mind also, that I live a little too close to LA, and that this
proximity has probably tainted my opinion of the random caller.

George
