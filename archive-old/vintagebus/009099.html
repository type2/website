&gt; NOW the difference!!! On the repops the VW part numbers all run together
and on the original, as per the picture posted by JP, each set of 3 numbers
has a space between them, other wise it would be hard to tell.
&gt;
Ummm, I have 2 styles in my personal stash:
Style #1 - Like JPs pictures, these are definitely originals.
Style #2 - Look exactly like the ones on eBay, the part # characters are
bigger and they run together, as you indicated  I'm pretty sure these are
originals too as they are beat to crap, not shiny, and I bought them at a
swap for a lot less than $18 each!

Perhaps 2 different original styles, and the repros copied the &quot;2nd&quot; style?
