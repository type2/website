I'm scalping for responses for this original question, as I remember
having a difficult time too on my '59 Beetle, and now I replace brake
fluid every few months.  Always knew in the back of my head that it was
to blame, but can never find the leaking fluid.  Hey, something to be
said for the reservoir set up on the buses, eh?  By the way, &quot;DNicholas&quot;,
if you do get a response from another list, pass it to my email please:
veadelcro_at_juno_dot_com.
