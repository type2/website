&gt; just got done changing draining my oil and adjusting my valves and decided to change my gear oil becouse i havent done it since i purchaced the tranny. well i got a little over excited that i worked on bus becouse i havent touched it in so long i forgot to refill the motor with oil. i let it run about 5 minutes before i realized i had no oil in the motor, after shutting it off i touched the heads, cylinders, and case. Nothing was hot or knocking but is there any thing i should fear that could be damaged?

Well, a lot of those snake-oil salesmen drain the oil out of engines and
run them for long periods of time to prove how good their snake oil is.
What they don't tell you is that it works as well without the snake oil.

Put some oil in and fire it up.  If it isn't making funny noises, run it
for a few minutes and drain the oil.  If the oil comes out clear record
the karma withdrawel, fill the sump, and drive happy!
