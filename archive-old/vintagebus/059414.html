 and seals are in place, increase oil cooler to a type 4 cooler, make sure 
you 
 run a 35mm (Inside measurement) wide cooling fan, a 2:1 lower pulley and a 
 Posche generator pulley.  For anymore cooling you would have to redesign the 
 cylinders, heads, and then the cooling tin to fit over the increased 
finning. 
  For that you may just need to step up to a late 356 Porsche engine and 
 install it in your bus!

Re Pulleys-

I know there are a number of different diameter lower pulleys out there, but 
has anyone actually measured them and know what comes from what, what sizes 
there are?  Or, actually, what diameter is the lower &quot;2:1&quot; pulley?  And where 
are you measuring them?
