Jamie Rivers added a couple more pictures to his web page.  At the bottom
are 2 pictures with captions courtesy of Jamie.  In the background of the
one pictures is my 66 bus with the towbar attached (if you look really close
you'll see it.)  Dig the rust underneath those cargo doors - major work
needed here.
