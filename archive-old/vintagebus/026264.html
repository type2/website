Well put Thom.
   I used to be in favor of parking cars in the yard and having a &quot;collection&quot;.
Now I'm a few years older and I have a house. Which inturn makes me interested
in property value. Property next to a junkyard isn't as valuable.
   I'm also an Alderman in the town I live in. I get calls about these things.
The voice of the many outway that of the few. Wether or not I agree doesn't
really matter. If I'm doing the job I'm elected to do, I have to vote in the
best interest of the town. My opinion counts as one vote. I don't want to get
into a politcal debate. :)
   The ordinance in our town is that if you have an unregistered vehicle it
must be out of site. A ratty old tarp won't cut it either. But a car cover is
acceptable. I don't live in the &quot;Big City&quot; either. I am about 60 miles west
of St. Louis, MO. The town has a population of about 650. That just goes to
show you that a smaller town isn't neccissarily the answer. 
   If your going to move to a new town, go to the city hall and ask for a copy
of the ordinance. Don't rely on the clerk to give you the correct answer either.
I've already got calls on that one too.
