Subject: Re: [VB] Berg or Hurst Bus shifter wanted; have bug ones to trade

oldschoolvw_at_aol_dot_com writ:


&gt;another shifter will not fix your sloppy linkage.......

Nope, and I am NOT talking about the linkage. The tranny nose has been
rebuilt using the Weddle Method, the rod coupling has been replaced, and
all the bushings save the rearmost have been replaced. Now, the TRANNY
might be toasting, but that is another matter :)


What is buggered is really the plate that rides up in the cab, and prolly
the little ball/spring/pin assembly on the end of the shifter; it sometimes
gets interference from the reverse side of things, and then prefers going
into 3/4 instead of 1/2 until you 'clear' it.
I could prolly even fix this with patient drive/adjust/drive procedures,
but I have a bunch of these 'cool' shifters for BUGS lying around, and
thought I'd see if I could convert them into trade/cash towards a project
for the sheer hell of it.
The naughty behavior started AFTER I recently replaced the 'toothpaste cap'
bushing under the shifter ball; it means things weren't really put back
together just &gt;so&lt; - but if I have to take it all apart again
anyways.......................
