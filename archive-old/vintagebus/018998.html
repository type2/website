Subject: Ebay 67 SO44 has new pictures...
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I noticed that the 67 SO44 Westfalia that was
discussed earlier this week, Item #541703694, has a
bunch of new photos. Looks like the seller noticed my
comments as well. &lt;embarrassing&gt;

I have no idea what the reserve is but keep in mind
that it cost me $14,500 to do the restoration on my
'67 SO42 and I still could have secretly picked it
apart lfor mistakes when it was fresh. Have more in it
than that now... AND it's not OG like this one. Pus
this is a European 44 kit not a 42.

Out of all of the years that I have been dealing with
buses this one is as factory fresh as I personally
have seen. There is another friend in Grants Pass, OR
that had one in HotVWs as a super low milage ultra
rare  camper find that may have been equal to or
better.

I know of *very* few camper buses that come close to
this level of OG. Included are the Grants Pass bus,
The 1HIPBUS and 2HIPBUS SO42 campers, an early one in
a garage in OCTO land and this ebay find. What's that?
Five buses of this category/in this league world wide?
Understand that I intentionally prefer not to mention
the owners names of these buses for security reasons.
If you know then be cool for the same reason.
Thought I'd pass it along...
