I'm in the market for a sandblaster.  Being a thrifty bus owner I really =
don't want to spend too much money - but I do want a good sandblaster.  =
So what would be my best option?  I used a friends before that was about =
3 feet high and filled from the top and was sort of locked closed before =
using.  It was probably all I need but ... who sells em?=20

TIA
