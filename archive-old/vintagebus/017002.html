Subject: New screen savers are available

Everyone -

I've finally recovered enough from buying a house and changing jobs to update the Vanagon screen saver and create screen savers for Splitties, Loafs, and Eurovans.  

Many thanks to everyone who submitted pictures or allowed me to gather pictures from their websites.

The screen savers are all available on my website:  www.transporter_dot_org

There's even one with all the pictures together.

Enjoy!!
