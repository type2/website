&gt;   We are visiting Las Vegas in our 59 bus and we were looking for a

&gt; probably the throwout bearing, (maybe worse?).  We think we will get it
&gt; home ok, just a little noise occasionally.  We will need to make about
&gt; 400 miles to get home.  Any estimates of life expectancy from this
&gt; condition?

throwout bearings can go a long time being noisy.  OTOH, every bearing was
fine just before it failed!

Since you're on the highway, you won't be using the clutch all that much,
so I'd say that your odds of getting home are good.  For peace of mind,
I'd buy a new throwout bearing and take it along in case the worst
happens.

I have driven several hundred highway miles with broken cables, so I know
it can be done if you have to.  it wasn't pleasant, though.
