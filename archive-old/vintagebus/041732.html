&gt; 4. 34 PICT 3 wide base Bocar
&gt; 5. 34 PICT 3 K-Cal wide base with extra arm for Cali. smog cars
&gt; 
&gt; All of these are avaiable and cost from 99.99 to 159.99
&gt; 
&gt; I prefer the 30 PICT 1 manual or electric but stay away from the
&gt; 30/31 as
&gt; they use different jets and use 2 pilot jets or the 34 pict 3, east
&gt; to
&gt; rejet. I have 25 different size jats for these, 5 different pilot
&gt; jets, so
&gt; making the 30 PICT 1 or the 34 PICT 3 work is easy.

I have two carb stories to tell.  Keep in mind that each is a single data
point and your installation will probably vary:

CARB #1
On Ronnie's advice, I used a Brazilian PICT30/31-3 Brosol with the
included adapter on my Mexican engine in my '71 bus.  It worked fine from
the get-go with a .009 distributor.

It started, idled, and ran fine out of the box  Good drivability.

The 34PICT flat spot is still there, but considerably reduced.

OTOH, I notice that the engine has a greater flattening of power at high
RPM than the old engine and 34PICT-3 that it replaced.  This is
particularly noticable when climbing hills.  Situations where I used to
hold 40MPH (actual) at partial throttle in third are now 37MPH (actual) at
WOT.  I don't know if this difference is due to the new engine or carb,
though.  I'm thinking of trying a 34PICT-3 to see if the carb is the
problem here.  A smaller throat would be expected to run out of breath at
high RPM.  The tailpipe is running black even after a long highway run, so
the power loss isn't due to a lean mixture.

CARB #2
I put a Mexican-made Bocar 30PICT-1 electric-choke carburator (also from
Ronnie) on our bug, also with a Mexican engine.  It sits on a dual-port
manifold sized for the 30 carb, so no adapter was needed.  I was not happy
with the machining of this carb, as the throttle butterfly was jammed
against the side of the carb bore when the throttle shaft nut was
tightened (the factory solution to this problem was to leave the nut
loose!)  I filed down the throttle shaft boss a bit to provide
clearance for the accelerator pump arm and then things were fine.  The
machine work on the Brazilian carb was much better.

The carb required normal tweaking to get it to work.  I'm still chasing
choke adjustments with the changing weather.  I can't judge power, as this
is my wife's car and all bugs feel like rocketships to me, but it seems to
drive the same as the Solex 30PICT-1 that it replaced.  The Solex carb is
going to Rimco for rebushing, as I still think that the German part is
better.
