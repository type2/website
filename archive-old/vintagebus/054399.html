&gt; OK, I have decided to try to replace the center pivot bushings and pin
on the '66.  I have read the info in the type2_dot_com library and on Thoms
vintagebus site.  I THINK I can handle everything except maybe the
reaming of the new bushings, my questions refer to this.  First of all,
is a reamer a standard tool I can pick up at my local Home Improvement
Warehouse for relatively cheap, or is it a specialty tool taht will cost
me big bucks and be hard to find (are they electric or hand driven?)

They are hand driven and expensive.  I've heard that some outfits will
rent them to you when you purchase your swing lever kit from them.

Question 2: Has anyone taken the pin and bushings to a machine and have
them ream them before installation, if so, how did this work for you??

I've read this someplace.  Don't remember where.
