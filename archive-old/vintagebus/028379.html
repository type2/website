can you explain a little more clearly how you insulated your floor, and kept
water out...i just replaced the original floor in my ez camper.
not the metal pan just the linoleum type stuff that was mounted to masonite. 
I put a slightly larger piece of flooring in last august, it already got
soaked, and warped. I used masonite that was hardened on both sides instead of
just one. I am doing this again, but don't feel like having to replace it
every 6 months....

suggestions please?
