&gt; &gt;The engine?  No worries as long as the cooling system is up to snuff.
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, most of the buses I see in distress suffer from bad seals
&gt; &gt;and missing hoses/tin, etc.

&gt; Yup i have a tape with VW commercials on it - Some of the ads brag about it
&gt; being able to run all day thru the sahara desert full throttle without
&gt; overheating.  It's all about the setup.

Of course I have a taped commercial that shows that an early bug could tow
a large omnibus easily even though the bug's driver forgot to release the
parking brake.  :)

I firmly believe that my bus can run all day at WOT in 110F temperatures.
However, you'll never catch me actually doing that, because the engine
life would be measured in hours.
