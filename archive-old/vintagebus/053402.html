&gt; &gt; Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
&gt; &gt; have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
&gt; &gt; because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
&gt; 
&gt; Most chains come in a bag or box that has a list of tire sizes printed on
&gt; it.  The proof of the pudding is whether it fits or not in your driveway!
&gt; 
&gt; I say driveway becuase this is the first plsce you should try them.  Don't
&gt; leave it to when you are trying to mount them in a blizzard with wet slush
&gt; tricking down your arms and onto your pants!
&gt; 
&gt; If you really want to do it right, get an extra spare tire and carry the
&gt; chains already mounted on the spares.  It's a lot easier to swap wheels
&gt; than it is to put chains on.

has anyone tried the &quot;automatic chains&quot;?  around here the fire dept uses
em. I have looked at em to fit my van. not cheap but flip a switch on the
dashboard and you have chains, flip it back and they are gone
