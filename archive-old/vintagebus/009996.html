there is a link on the vw planet site that has his info.

&gt;
&gt; There's a guy named Tom (sorry I can't remember his last name) in Deer
&gt; Park, Idaho that custom makes any size/any kind of rack you can imagine
&gt; and they are nice racks!  I've seen a couple of his &quot;Dormobile&quot; racks on
&gt; single cabs.  Hope that helps a little.
