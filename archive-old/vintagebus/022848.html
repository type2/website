As I'm in the middle of color sanding, and going crazy looking at spots
thinking &quot;Is the paint too thin, or is it just the way the light is hitting
it?&quot; I keep thinking how much nicer it would have been to just drop it off
and pick it up.  I might have even had a social since Novemeber!  OTOH, I
don't know that I would have got the same amount of work for $1500 here.

&gt; As Ronnie stated I had a local body shop due the final body work and paint
&gt;on the 63. I welded in the rear wheelwells and the 5 camper window holes.
&gt;This is the 1st time I have had someone else do my final body work and
&gt;paint, I just ran out of time.
&gt; There was no way I was going to Kelly Park in a primered bus and face Thom
&gt;after all the cr###p i gave him about his buses.
&gt;I can say it was well worth it. $ 1500 to finish and paint inside and out.
&gt;See what you think at K.P. This was with epoxy primer guide coated and
&gt;urethane final paint and no buying sand paper, grinding wheels, buffing
&gt;pads,  welding 24 small holes, repairing dash, and on and on. For the price,
&gt;will do it again and save the time for going to VW shows.
