Subject: Windshield Washer Ring Source
Date: Wed, 8 Jul 1998 06:13:46 -0700 

Going through the boxes of parts yet to
be installed on the '67 Deluxe HT, I found
the windshield washer tank and the rubber
push top squirter that still works.

However, I was unable to find the plastic
ring that holds the squirter to the tank.

Is this ring available, or does anyone know
of a standard off-the-grocery-shelf product
with the proper cap diameter to modify for use?
