Subject: June's OCTO Shirt Question...

Hey all,

I was wearing my OCTO shirt from last month's event and took a moment to 
just admire the back of it.  I'm always impressed with the artwork and the 
quality of the colors.

But then I noticed something...Can anyone in the know confirm or deny that 
the Westy in line on the shirt is actually Ricky &quot;Been Travelin All Over 
the US&quot; Fu's '66 Westy and the Dormobile is acutally Susan Dolvin's (fmr. 
Crandall's) &quot;Zapper&quot; Dormy?

I'd swear they're dead-ringers for the originals!
