Hey all,

I recently changed my tall 205/75/r15s riding on 4.5 in wide beetle rims to 
195/60 lower profiles.  I like the appearence and the feel but do not like 
my new &quot;gear ratio&quot; , to my calculations my speedo reads 5mph over reality 
and my engine is winding out like I'm at least going this pretend speed.  I 
just changed my rear and front tranny mounts w/ bug pack polyurethane mounts 
so the added noise fuels my engine winding concerns.

Anyway I wanted to go back to my 34 pict 3 (i'm running a 30/31 pict) for 
the power gains to help compensate for the new ratio (my engine seemed to 
carry a lower rpm for same speed w/ the smaller carb?)but didn't want to 
deal w/ the dreaded flat spot.  I decided to try one of the 6 old vacuum 
dizzys I had lying around so I went to my local FLAPS and got proper cap, 
rotor, points, and condensor.  The condesor contact plug for the points that 
goes inside the dizzy body was too big so I just put the 2 wires to the 
points and taped it up (will this not work?) set it up just like my 009 and 
put him in w/ rotor to the notch at TDC w/ about 28 degrees advance ATDC and 
no go!  Tryed it twice and both times just through the 009 in and bus 
started fine.  I originally hooked up the vacuum line to the intake and 
finally to the other 2 fittings on the 30/31 pict.  Any ideas?  Is it my 
shady condesor wiring?  Is my bosche silver wanabe blue coil wrong for this 
mystery dizzy.  I did check to see if the vacuum canister would hold and 
advace.  I don't have the dizzy # w/ me but I believe its pretty early.

TIA, hope you guys can make any sense my ramblings!

Eric
