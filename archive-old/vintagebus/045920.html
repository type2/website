&lt;&lt; It has always been my understanding that the crows feet rims were for 
trucks, the non crow's feet for buses. No proof I guess, just what I heard.

Hi Kyle,
The problem with that theory is there is only one part number for the rim 
used from chassi No. 20 - 117 902 (1955) on in our 1959 VW parts book.  Plus 
there is no mention of what model used on.  While farther down the same page 
there is the onamental ring for the 15&quot; rim and says it was stock only on 
models 241, and 244 both delux buses.   Eric&amp;Barb
