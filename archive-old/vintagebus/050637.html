Subject: Re: [VB] Site w/ Vintage Color Charts? Paint type?


&gt; Coming down to the wire on figuring out what color to paint my 56 vert.
&gt; Also going to be re-painting this spring my 60 crewcab so I need to figure
&gt; that out too.  I just came back from the auto paint store to figure out
what
&gt; paint I was going to use and looked at the color charts.  They had a old
&gt; Glasurit paint book but it was all in german.  I thought there was a site
&gt; that had vintage VW color charts with names.  Anyone know of a site?  I am
&gt; thinking a two tone color for the vert in greens or just a solid green
&gt; pastel color.  Got to be vintage looking.  Any suggestions?
&gt;

Wolfsburg West has charts.

&gt; Also, I will be painting the car myself in a rented booth.  I wanted a
good
&gt; paint with lots of that &quot;show winning deep shine&quot; and was considering the
&gt; base coat/clear coat system (?).     The lady at the counter talked me
into
&gt; using Dupont Chroma Base paint.  Anyone use this?

Dupont is fine, but Glasurit was the OEM manufacturer for the OG paint on
your car. They are going to be the closest match to OG. If you can afford
Dupont, get Glasurit instead. Base/Clear is the &quot;only&quot; way for a quality
job.
