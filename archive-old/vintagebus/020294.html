John, et al

This is one of those things where I never win, but I gotta try anyway.   It's a
cyclical thing.  Everything goes fine and dandy for a while, then we get some
new blood, who gets bent when I try to do my moderation job.  I get the snot
flamed out of me, then after a couple of weeks, the hubub dies down, and all is
quiet again until the next hairtrigger issue comes up.  If you don't believe me,
cruise the archives when they come back up.  I could probably automate this 
message via cron and nobody would really notice.

If I let the political/legislative/flame stuff fester - nay even let it start, I'll 
get flamed for not stopping it, and if I try to kibosh it, I'll get flamed for that 
too.  There is no middle ground.  It won't be but a couple of emails when some
pundit-wannabe will blame it on the democrats or the republicans or the whigs
or the tories, and the next thing you know, you've got a nasty flame war going.  

If you want to see pure, unadulterated (aka *unmoderated*) political discussion, 
mosey on over to vintagvw.  Bring nomex, but leave your tools at home, 'cause there 
ain't much useful VW discussion.  Several of the bus list people are also over
there as well.  Right this minute there's a full-fledged barroom brawl in progress.

I've been running the list several years now, and have dealt with this crap before, 
and I'll deal with it again.   Compared to the type2 list admin junta, I'm a bleeding
heart tree hugger.  They have have the word &quot;ebay&quot; filtered at the server level, among
others.  They wouldn't have politely suggested to take it to Friday; they would have 
dropped you from the list distribution, killfiled you, kiboshed all of the relevant 
replies, and kicked your dog.

I'm especially heavy handed with political issues because they get out of hand faster 
and uglier than anything else; ebay is a close second, with cal-look buses rounding out
third.   

This is not a &quot;rescue the baby from a burning building&quot; issue; it can perfectly well wait 
36 hours.  Rather than climb up on the high horse and flame me, you'd have done well to
organize your thoughts, and come up with a more rational, less sensational post, which
would do everyone much more service.   For instance, you could have done some front-end
research, so you'd be able to say exactly how it affected bus people, who would be
affected, and exactly what they could do about it.  In addition, there's the teeny-tiny
fact that only a small percentage of the list populace actually lives in California,
and if recent national events are any indication, the rest of the US would just as soon 
see us burn in hell. (they're jealous of the rust-free buses)

I'm not denying you have a valid issue, I just would rather see it on Friday.  

This stuff is spelled out in the list charter that was sent to you when you signed up.

I scolded jerry for the ebay posting as well, 'cept some people posted replies before I
got to him.  I take it easy on him 'cause he's an old timer.

We, the collective admins of the lists, take pride in the civilised, non-political, non-flaming
nature of the list.  We've spent many *years*, and a lot of time and *money* to get the
list structure and culture where it is now.   One of the biggest intrinsic values of the
list *is* the moderation.   You can go thru the archives, and find usefull *bus* content, not
dated political crap.  It's a subtle distinction, one that most people don't really
notice at first, if at all.

So, if you choose not to support the list financially based on not being able to discuss 
this legislation on a non-friday, well, I guess there's not much I can do about it.  Steve Dolan 
has been paying to host the list out of his *own* pocket - money spent to keep the list running
instead of buying bus parts, like rockers for his '67 westy.  Others have contributed sysadmin 
resources, hardware, programming expertise, bandwidth, and their own personal time to handle the
day-to-day operation of the lists and the site.    While your contribution will be missed, I 
am not in the position to &quot;sell&quot; list bandwith for editorial time in exchange for contributions.
