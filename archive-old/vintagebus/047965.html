Wow......How many of us have not dreamed of this evening?  The 
rolling of the nines, even though it is not the real &quot;new milineum&quot;, 
it is the percived one.  How many of us have wondered what we would 
be doing or whether we would even be alive to see it?

I want all of you to know that you are a great bunch of people.  Just 
like any other group we share a lot of diversity in our ranks, but I 
know of no one else I would rather have coming across my computer 
screen, or driveway, than the members of this list.

Celebrate the New Year reflecting on the past, and use that to set 
good focus for the future.  I will be sitting on my front porch, 
having a sip of southern sweet tea, admiring the Mothership. 
Thinking of all the great things she has brought to my life.  Of 
which includes all of you.

Go easy people, and take care of one another.  It's how we've gotten this far.

Call if ya need me, and thanks for joining A.I.R.S.
