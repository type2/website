Subject: Re: [VB] High Alt Carb Tuning

I'd be interested too.  Nobody seems to know.  Best
bet is to weld in an oxygen sensor in your exhaust and
read it out, I guess.  I did some reading in Bentley
tonight, and read about a cool altitude compensator
that used to exist.  It replaced the carb main jet and
consisted of some bellows attached to a jet such that
the mixture would automatically get leaner at high
altitudes.  I'd sure like to find one of those!  The  
book says they're very specific to carb model, main
size, etc.  Then too, I remember that JC Whitney used
to sell an adjustable main for solex carbs.  A big
brass knob on the side of the carb;  set it how you
like it.  That could be an answer.

I know my '67 bus tends to run too rich with the
34-PICT-3.  Although flat-landers will tell you that
that carb is too lean across the board.  My motor also
failed emissions, with the 34-pict-3 and 009; 
although I tend blame the cam (mild, but not stock). 
Mine failed for excess hydrocarbons.

&gt;  Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt;   I just moved back to Colorado Springs Co from
&gt; Chattanooga, TN. Today I went 
&gt; to get my emissions test done so I could get it
&gt; registered. I wasn't to 
&gt; surprised when it didn't pass. CO was 7.5ppm, legal
&gt; limit is 5.5ppm. 
&gt;   Now let me give you some background as to what I
&gt; have. I am running a 
&gt; Mexican 1600 DP with a new solex 34pict3 carb and
&gt; 009.I did a tune up so I 
&gt; know the timing, dwell and all is fine. I'm fairly
&gt; certain its a jetting 
&gt; problem as I have experienced a loose of power also.
&gt; I know a lot of it is 
&gt; due to the fact I am at 6000 ft above sea level
&gt; here. What I need to know is 
&gt; if anyone has info on rejetting the 34-3 carb for
&gt; this alt. Of course I would 
&gt; need to know the main jet size, air correction,
&gt; pilot jet and accelerator 
&gt; pump setting. Any info would be greatly appreciated.
