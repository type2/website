Subject: Horsehair Pads - Preserve or Pitch?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id JAA11332

Here are the stats and conditon:

1959 Westfalia SO23
Parked in 1976, and sat until 1998-99, rescued and sitting again during restoration

So, the bus was used for 17 years and has sat for 24 years.  I diassembled the rear cushions so that the seamstress could make patterns from the old cushion covers in order to make the new cushion covers.  The horsehair pads LOOK almost new, no indentations from big, wide butts sitting on them, and very little hair silt from crumbling/decay.  All in all they're still very intact.  So what's the problem?

Well, I hate to go to all of the work of preserving the horsehair pads and stapling on the new cushion covers if the darn things are just going to crumble away after using them a month or two.  The pads might look good, but I'm afraid they're so brittle from age that any significant use will destroy them.  I'm sure they'd look good forever if never used, but I plan on using this camper after the initial honeymoon/show tour/paranoia months pass.

Any suggestions out there?  Keep the original horsehair in and my fingers crossed, or rebuild them out of new material for comfort and durability?

TIA.

Robert
