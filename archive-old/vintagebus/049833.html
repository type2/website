Subject: Re: [VB] 'That VW Guy' - A WARNING TO EVERYONE - LONG

Thom and everyone:


&gt;a) Please do not air out your dirty laundry on the list


Sorry if I broke a rule.  After reading all about the GEX problem someone
had, and I'm sure that I've read other complaints about certain sellers, I
thought this was OK.  We are all here to help each other, and warnings
about a possible bad egg are helpful, right?


&gt;
&gt;b) If you do feel a compelling urge to post a transactional complaint,
&gt;please don't cough up a message that contains every single correspondence
&gt;between the two parties all the way back to Ben Pon's lunch with Heinz
&gt;Nordhoff.

I felt that background was necessary.  Otherwise, my post would have been
simple sniping and grumbling.



&gt;
&gt;c) Please do not air out your dirty laundry on the list


OK.  Again - SORRY.
