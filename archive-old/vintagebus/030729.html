Subject: &lt;-&amp;67 bumpers different from 68&amp;-&gt;

At first glance the front/visible profiles look similar to the post
63/64 splittie bumper, but the mounting brackets and bracket *mounts* on
the back of the bumpers are way different. Bay bumpers have two
horizontally aligned holes for each side. The splitties will be
different. I think one hole through the bumper with more substantial
mounting plate on the back-non visible(actually forward) side of the
bumper. You will also find that the bumper is/might be very slightly
wider- from side to side- on the bay windows. Also the splash pans are
about .75&quot; longer (wider-side to side) than the splitty parts. Bay
splash pans will not work on splitty bumpers due to the misalignment of
holes and extra width. Some one might write in and say that they got
these parts to work but point is that the fit is not proper and there
are differences. Bailing wire, plasma cutters and an afternoon of
welding can make darned near anything &quot;fit&quot; if pushed.

Also your 63 should have a set of bumpers that have one surface angle on
the side profile, commonly referred to as a &quot;slash&quot; bumper(s). Later
splitties (66-67 per the NEATO/SSVC spec book) and the early bays have
bumpers with a two angle pointed profile.
I always thought that the peaked bumpers were 64 and later but I defer
to the NEATO/SSVC specifications.

Dont get burned! Dont ask how I learned this stuff. I've been there done
that... Sheepishly admitting that sometimes it was the hard way. =)
