   for some reason I thought FPs were NLA now.  Glad you can still get new 
ones.  

Ya, slop in the FP/Crown gear/axle shaft area means you feel it when you 
suddenly step on or off the clutch or the gas, a thunk from the back, if the wear 
is bad enough.

Why not just buy NEW GENUINE VW fulcrum plates with NO
wear on them. Yes folks, they still are available. ..... They are cheap, less
than $10 each, even if you buy them from a retail source like CB..........
Since this is not really a fun job to do twice,especially if it's 
re-installed in the bus, why not put the best parts in the first time, rather than
marginal used stuff.
