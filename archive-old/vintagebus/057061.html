Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Westfalia in Hot VW's

You guys obviously never pick up the magazine then,
cause last months issue had Matt's deluxe, and this
new issue has a 57 deluxe restoration in it.

Congrats Robert! I can't wait to see it...I think
&gt; that might the first VW
&gt; magazine I buy this year. I'm guessing it might be
&gt; the last too (unless
&gt; there's another accidental shot of one of my
&gt; vehicles at a show again).
&gt; Remember there's always a small handful of us that
&gt; like stock.
