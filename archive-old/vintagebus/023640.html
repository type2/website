&lt;&lt; I have a panel that has no upper vents in the cargo area is this rare? It 
is 
an american camper and the m-code 116 means there are no vents in the cargo, 
i checked the bus registry on thom's site and there are no others like it. 
Also what qualifies a bus as being prepared for swiss liscensing? Thanks for 
the help.

I think all walk through panels didn't have vents in the top.
Is you're a walk through?
