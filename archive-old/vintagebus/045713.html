&lt;&lt; The reason for the request is that I have a barn full of VW parts.  Just 
 about every model and almost every part.   I would like to know were the 
 parts came from and was hoping to find out though the VW part number on 
 them.  It is just a curiosity thing to know what vehicle the parts was 
 specifically used on.  This would also help in selling any parts that people 
 may need.  Anyway, I was looking at info on how to decifer the VW part 
 number for ALL air cooled VW models.
 
 Thanks for your help and any information would be greatly appreciated.

sounds like you need some parts lists.   I believe a listmember Steve Howell 
had some FS, he may still.   Then you can look up the number and identify the 
part, the book will tell you what it is, and what model it came on, and what 
Chassis #s it is for, and how many per vehicle you use.     There are 
different editions, ie the 58, 61, 63, etc etc, and older ones are more 
thourough on older parts, but don't list anything made after the book was 
published, while later editions have later parts, they get skimpy on the 
older stuff as parts became NLA or were superceded.
