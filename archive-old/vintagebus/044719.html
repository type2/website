 I know that this is a pretty dumb question, but I'm not sure what kind of tar
 you're specifying - is this stuff ever available in a caulking gun 
container? 
 I've looked and can't find anything but that stuff - and it is the fiberous
 tar.  I asked in the local home depot but they didn't know of other types. 
 But then again, sometimes those guys don't know every category in that big 
ol'
 store.  Should the stuff be located near the &quot;regular&quot; roofing tar and I'm
 just missing it?

yes you can get in a caulk container type for a gun, but I have a pint metal 
pot of it.  replaced the windsheild in my bug the other day- that scrape from 
the PO bad wiper right in the driver's vision area has been bugging me for 
years!!!  I peeled the seal back, that I had replaced a few years ago, pushed 
the windsheild out (no broken glass to clean up this way), swapped the seal 
onto the new shiny glass, mixed up some roofing tar and oil, made a mushy 
film on the ledge (the old stuff was kinda thickly) wiped the seal clean with 
oil to dissolve the old tar on it, oiled where the glass went in the seal, 
and outside, installed string, and set the glass in the rust free window 
area.   realised I couldn't do this by myself, at that point the phone rang, 
it was a friend who came over and helped by holding the glass while I pulled 
the string at a 90 degreee angle to get the lip over the metal.   slipped in 
all nice and easy.   cleaned it up with rags and wd-40 and then glass clean 
stuff.  no scrapes or rock chips or myriad tiny scrathes from air dust!!!!

yes this is a bug, but same install procedure as a bus, only a bus is easier, 
as the glass is flat (my year bug has a slight curve) and the glass is 
smaller, and the friend doesn't have to lean over the hood to press on it.

funny thing is the new glass was brand SEKURIT, but is laminated.
