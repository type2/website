Subject: Re: Bought a Sunroof Bus help(questions) needed 

Hi Dave,

I've been very slow in building a resource that would answer your  
questions, as I need to eventually do this same thing. I have been  
working on a page containing commonly found info, but hopefully in one  
place it can be useful.

http://www.dualport_dot_com/21window/sunroof.html

I believe I have a link on that page to the repro tension bar someone  
is selling.

I've been collecting detail shots of pieces and assemblies at various  
shows. The &quot;kits&quot; all seem to be the same to me. There are some parts  
that are NLA such as the wood blocks.

Conrad
