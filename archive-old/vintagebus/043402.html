&gt;Hey list, can anyone help?

I sent a message to the list earlier...here I go again...

&gt;What is the best solution for the emergency flasher system on a 65 bus?
&gt;It is a ine year thing and i am not sure the best way to go about making
&gt;this work.

Best?  Scope swap meets for the original switch and relay.  :)  
Bentley's says that for 6v Buses, '63, '64, and '65 all use the
same parts.  '66 is when the dreaded &quot;nine prong box&quot; started for
the US buses.

Next best would be to get a &quot;generic&quot; push-pull switch and &quot;generic&quot;
automotive relay and wire them up the same as VW wired theirs...same
effect without having to wait for the next swap meet.

&gt;I have tried to install the kit that alot of the shop's use but i do not
&gt;think it will work.  this is the kit made by Wire works that replaces
&gt;the flasher system on everything but a bus.  (I have been told it can be
&gt;converted for a bus but how???)

&lt;flame subj=&quot;poor web design&quot;&gt;
First off, if you need your browser crashed, visit wire-works_dot_com .
A wide selection of huge .GIFs, Java, and Craptive Server for your
browser-destroying pleasure...Turn everything off to get it loaded,
then turn Java back on so you can navigate.  Expect a 404 about
every fifth page or so.
&lt;/flame&gt;

I looked at their Web site and I see an &quot;FW-4&quot; Emergency Flasher
Switch...this appears to be the switch only but I bet it's the same
one you have.  It looks like it has one terminal in the center and
four terminals at the corners of the switch.  If you are using this
switch, or got this switch as part of a kit, I think I can tell
you how to hook it up.

You have to use a separate flasher, so if you don't have one, go
get a &quot;generic&quot; two prong flasher at your FLAPS.  Run a wire from
the top contact of the rightmost fuse (battery power) through a
15a or 20a fuse to the &quot;X&quot; terminal of the flasher.  Run a wire
from the &quot;L&quot; terminal of the flasher to the center terminal of
your switch.

Identify the VW turn signal light wires under the dash.  They
should be:

right front  black/green stripe
left front   black/white stripe
right rear   black/orange stripe
left rear    black/yellow stripe

Basically you need to connect another wire to each of these wires
and run them to the four remaining terminals on your switch --
it's not important which wire goes to which terminal.  Note that
the connections as they are now still have to be there -- you
have to *add* the connections to your new switch.  Probably the
easiest place to do this is at the turn signal switch, as all
four wires above should have factory connectors at the turn signal
switch.  I would make up short jumper wires with the take-off
for your new wire rather than cutting the original harness.

For example, say the original wire has a splice with female 
connectors on the wire and a double-male connector splice.
Unhook the double-male connector and set it aside.  Strip two
14 gauge wires 0.5&quot;/1.3cm and twist together, and crimp a
yellow-barrel male connector on this twist.  Cut one of the new
wires about three inches away, strip the end 0.5&quot;, and crimp a
blue-barrel male connector on it.  Plug the original wires into
the two male connectors you just crimped.  The remaining (long)
new wire goes to your new flasher switch.

When you get it all hooked up, pull the knob on your new switch
and all four corners should flash.  Push the knob in and test
your brake lights and turn lights all around to make sure they
work right.

Good luck!
