&gt; Bus content... Went to a beer festival in Anderson Valley, CA. A sub-hatch Westy, double door panel from a cider company.

I ran into these guys in Healdsburg Friday afternoon. I told them about the Vallejo show, but they told me they were on there way to a beer fest. The white Westy owner was who I talked with. The logo on the Blue DD led me to believe they were from the Sacramento area........

When I drove away he said, &quot;maybe we'll see you at BUS-O-Rama&quot;. I've never heard that, but I liked it................
