Subject: pic of '59 Kombi damage
Mime-Version: 1.0

I put a picture up of the damage to my front drivers dogleg on my '59 
Kombi. It happened after a drive down the highway. The lug bolts backed off 
and the wheel came off when I was going about 20mph. No one was hurt except 
the bus. It seems to be mechanically good again after having the drum 
turned and inspecting/greasing the bearings and hub. But now I'm gonna have 
to fix that wheel arch. Oh well.

There's a picture from that day on Thom's site at:

  (after I got it back together and drivable and made it to our VW club 
meeting in the park)
