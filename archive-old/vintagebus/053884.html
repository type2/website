Subject: austin tx. air coolers show

what a great show,more busses than you could shake a
stick at. lots of enthusiasm from the folks putting on
the show. some of the neatest classes that i have ever
heard of{car that would least likely be let back in
the u.s. from mexico, car you would'nt want your
daughter to be in on her prom date}garrett and the
members of the aircoolers have such a great sence of
humor that it was hard not to enjoy yourself. free,
show and swap great band and lots of cars and busses
that usually don't make it to the regular shows made
for a great fall afternoon of vw's, there was a black
53 oval that had some of the coolest accessories,
everything from a,spot light mirror to a moto meter
gauges in the dash, the car was all original . if you
missed the show you missed a real down home 6o's style
austin texas vw show that will be hard to top next
year, thanx, aircoolers for a great time
