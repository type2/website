Subject: Re: [VB] Valve Adjustment :-)
Message-ID: &lt;19991221065608.21582.qmail_at_web901.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Hi guys....I have been half assed followin this
thread...here is just a (maybe) stupid stupid question
I have, yes I may be wrong but for the life of me I
can't see how?

Ok....would not a loose valve actually sit on its seat
(closed) longer then a tight valve?  Since there is
greater space between the adjuster and valve stem the
vavle would be closed longer, thus resting on the seat
disapateing heat away like mad.  

The tighter valve would actually sit on the seat for
less time before opening correct?...And a valve with
say no valve lash could almost run valve open when
warm without the vavle ever resting on the seat for
cooling thus overheating the valve and &quot;bye bye valve
city&quot;

In all my numerous years driving rebuilding engines
ect I am know very confused about more then one listee
repeating this idea...If there is some magically leap
againist common physics of a loose vavle let me know? 

...confused...(usually just drunk)
tds

&gt; &gt; An even easier way to adjust valves:
&gt; &gt; Turn engine in direction of rotation. When exhaust
&gt; valve JUST starts to
&gt; &gt; open, adjust intake. Rotate engine, watch exhaust
&gt; open then close, watch
&gt; &gt; intake open then close. JUST as the intake closes,
&gt; adjust the exhaust.
&gt; &gt; Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. Takes longer
&gt; to R + R valve covers than
&gt; &gt; to adjust. Don't need to watch dist. rotor or
&gt; timing mark.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this method is perfectly acceptable IF and
&gt; ONLY IF you are using
&gt; a stock camshaft. ANY of the hot- medium- or mild-
&gt; grind cams with a
&gt; non-stock ramp to the lobes may very well be far
&gt; from the lowest point
&gt; on the lobe ( which is where you want the valve play
&gt; set from) if you
&gt; use this method, and you will end up with loose
&gt; valves a clattering.
&gt; Loose valves not only cut down power, but as Stephen
&gt; pointed out
&gt; earlier, a loose valve will not cool as well,
&gt; because heat dissipation
&gt; onto the seat surface of the head will be lessened. 
&gt; If you are going to try one of these methods on an
&gt; angine you yourself
&gt; did not assemble, I would check all valve clearances
&gt; the old-fashioned
&gt; one cyclinder-at-a-time method after you do it, the
&gt; very first time. If
&gt; all is well, you most likely have a stock or close
&gt; enough to stock cam
&gt; that you can go with this method.
