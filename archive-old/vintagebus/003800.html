&gt; Hoping someone could identify this beast for me.

Certainly, that is a Horror Show. Ugly as a hat full of armpits. Pretty
cool, though, is it thrashed? If it were an RV company doing it there would
probably be stickers or emblems somewhere, or the remnants of them. Put up
some more pics, then you can slap it on eBay if no one jumps up to buy it.
