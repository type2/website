Hey Isaiah,
        Go to your local hardware store and buy some 8 mil. optical plastic
and some velcro.
Make a template out of cardboard and velcro that sucker in. Stay warm and
still see out the back!

&gt; hey all
&gt; I dunno how long I'll be driving Stella in this chilly weather, and her
&gt; heat is GREAT in back...but is pathetic up front.  I'm going to run
&gt; tubes up to the front from the back tubes under the bench seat (was a 7
&gt; passenger bus) for heat...I wanted to block off the front from the
&gt; back.  Has anyone ever made a cab divider? How would one do it? is
&gt; cardboard good? or should i use some thinner wood?  Its a walk through,
&gt; so I figured maybe someone did it in a walk through split.  tis why its
&gt; on the vintage list.  Its for a 71.  So any input would be greatly
&gt; appreciated!
&gt;
&gt; thanks
