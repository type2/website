&lt;&lt; Any ideas on this? My bus is West Coast all the way. Any ideas what to
 do if I keep it and move to a place where they put salt on the roads? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jay,
Well you could completely disassemble your bus have the body bead blasted,
all missing metal replaced and body worked, the remaining paint chemically
stripped off, then have the cleaned metal shell acid dipped and zinc plated.
Followed by painting and waxing or check the archives for alot of ideas that
are not quite so extreme, but very helpfull!  Eric&amp;Barb
