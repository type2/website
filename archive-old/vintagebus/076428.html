&gt; whats the concensus about hooking one of these up when you buy one used?
&gt; what do you look for? how do you make sure its in operating condition? im
&gt; assuming the thing can be a time bomb of unknown history... it would worry
&gt; me.

When I got mine, I pulled the burner assembly apart to clean it, but the
burner, and inside the combusion chamber it was quite clean. Dusty is all. I
cleaned the fuel nozzle stuff, and the fuel shutoff solonoid.

Since the exhaust pipe to the burner is always open (1 1/4&quot; ID), I honestly
don't think you have to worry about it becoming a 'bomb' of any sort. I
tested mine in the driveway, having fuel spray inside for a few seconds,
then connecting the coil to ignite it (kind of a &quot;what if this happened in
my bus), and nothing much happened. Lots of black smoke poofed out the
tailpipe. I tried that a few times, each time  increasing the amount of time
the fuel sprayed without spark, and the most it would do is produce a big
sooty 'poof' out the tail pipe. I tried killing the ignition while the fuel
was spraying when it was ignited, and the fuel kept burning like normal. The
burner is a nice quality build, made of stainless steel.

I think the gas heaters are actually pretty safe. Just make sure your fuel
lines and thier connections are in good shape, just like you would your
engine. I'm thinking 99.9% of fires blamed on gas heaters is from a fuel
line getting old and cracking or something like that, not the burner itself.
