I'm almost done with my rebuild, but as usual another problem has arisen...
I bought some &quot;swivel foot&quot; adjusters to replace my worn stockers and when 
they are all the way backed out the ends never come off the valve stems. I 
have the washers that came with the new adjusters under the rocker stands, 
but I need more clearance and am running out of stud. Is it O.K. to just 
crank out the stud the 1/4 inch or so that I need, or do I need longer ones? 
Who knows, maybe if I can finnish this monster in time, the Bus Rally may 
come through Minneapolis!
