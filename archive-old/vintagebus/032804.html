&lt;&lt; Those syringes are very handy when used as oilers, so don't chuck it when
 your project is done.
 
 Really slick for lubing instruments, etc., and even for hinge pins and the
 like if you have a coarse enough needle.
  &gt;&gt;
also, when you have a reservoir full of gucky old brake fluid, you can 
syringe it out instead of pumping it through the system.
