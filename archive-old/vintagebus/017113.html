The setup will only work if you replace *both* the apron and engine lid.
The way they attach to the car is identical, but they way they mate is
different. (not that that's bad...)

The '66/'67 apron has a bolt-on catch on *top* of the apron surface; the
previous ones have a boxy cutout, and the catch is at the bottom of
that.  The later setup provides both locking and a more positive latch, but
at the expense of having that dang tab in the way.

Another option if you want a locking engine lid on a church-key equipped bus
is to do the patented VintageBus_dot_com trick of installing an upper hatch T-handle.

&gt; YES... but the parts themselves will be ok... pat can just swap the 
&gt; hardware.
