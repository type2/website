&lt;&lt; I'd planned on putting on a VDO gauge, but in talking with the Berg folks, 
they informed me that in all their testing the VDO units were VERY 
inaccurate.  The fact that the warning light dipstick gauge was 1/3 the price 
also convinced me.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The little testing we have done has shown us that VDO oil temp gauges are 
very accurate! Plus they do not cost much if you buy them used from swap 
meets or wrecking yards out of Rabbits.  These cost us $5.00 or less then we 
buy the senders for $15.00 -30.00 new.  The senders are the part that tends 
to go bad not the gauges.  Even if a gauge is off, really you are looking for 
trends of how the engine is running, outside weather conditions, and 
hills/payloads you are moving.
Just recently we started out for Sacramento from Seattle.  Weather was in the 
50s and drizzling.  Suddenly we could smell burnt oil from the heating 
system.  Looked at the pressure gauge that had been reading about 42 lbs. at 
our highway speed it was dropping to 35, 30, 25, 20 where we shut down the 
engine and we coasted off to the side of the road.  Turned out the sump bolt 
had fallen out resulting in instant oil change!  Something that no idiot 
light could have warned us about until it was way too late!  All we had to do 
was install a new bolt add two quarts of oil and away we went with no damage 
to our engine.  
Loosing the sump bolt was rather upsetting due to the fact that we are very 
carefull to make sure it is tight after an oil change which we had done 1,000 
miles before.  Just the week before had the engine out to tighten all of the 
case and head fasteners and must of bumped the sump bolt a little loose with 
the hydralic jack.  After installing an engine we will now make sure the sump 
bolt is still tight from now on.  Thinking of safety wiring the sump bolt....
