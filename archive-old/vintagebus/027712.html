   A secret to clearing out the idle circuit on any Solex carb with a idle
cut off or idle air correction solenoid is to 1. remove the solenoid  2.
remove the air correction jet 3. blow compressed air through both openings
4. replace all parts and your idle will be back.
   I do this all the time here in the shop and have solved many an idle
problem by doing this. You would not believe how many vehicles come in the
shop with this problem after major replacement of about every tune up part
there is and all it turns out to be is a piece of crap plugging an orifice
in the idle circuit.

Cris , I'm having same problem with 34PICT3 carb on a 71 westie, It was 
running good, had just tuned up and adjusted carb and was amazed at how easy

the carb adjusted,not being a carb guy I though I was doing good, 1/2 turn
on 
idle screw changed R.P.M., Turned mix screw to obtain fastest idle and back 
in 1/4 turn, than set idle, Perfect.... I stoped for gas and toped it up. I 
got 30 mi. and than, same problem you had, no idle. I've tried dry gas,maybe

bad gas, Have replaced 2 filters, one on tank line &amp; one on carb line. I'm 
going crazy trying to get caught up _at_ work so I can make trip to 
E.B.2001,Maybe a new carb will be easyest fix           Tom in Pa.
