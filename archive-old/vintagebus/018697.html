I wouldn't use less than a 4 inch slab.  2 inch might
be okay for a lightly used sidewalk, but not for
anything with a vehicle on it. Around here (western
Wis) they use a fiberglass strand in the concrete, but
we used 6x6 mesh in the floor also, and we put tubing
in the floor for radiant heat, too, so we insulated
under and around the slab.(look at
http://www.nextstepenergy_dot_com/ for some in-floor
heating info)
I don't have the heat source (solar panels) hooked up
and working yet, but they should give me a moderately
warm floor in frigid weather, when everything is
connected.
