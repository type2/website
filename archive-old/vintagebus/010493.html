I would be more concerned about trashing the theads in the case myself. I
have always got senders that when installed oiltight have 4 or 5 milimetres
of thread showing between the boss and the case. 

Seems to me that this is always going to be an invitation to people like my
thick wristed friend Robert, who snaps off studs and breaks bolts when they
have any thread still showing, to wind these things in too tight.
