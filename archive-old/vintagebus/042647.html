well,

If you had searched the archives or read the library you would know this,
but i am in a good mood so will reward your laziness ;)

a 68 or 69 bay front beam is a direct bolt up to a splitty frame, no
cutting no mess just slap it in.

the springs are stiffer so your front end will ride high.

The 68-69 beam has the same torsion arms/balljoints as a 71-79 beam, so
the disk brake spindles will bolt right up.

To do a perfect job, you would also need to retrofit a 71-79 MC and put in
teh brake proporioning valve, but this isnt totally neccecary..

Optionally, wolfgang sells adapters to put disc brakes on your kingpin
front end (same bus brakes, different caliper mount) OR bus boys sells
balljoint arms turned to fit a 65-66+ splitty beam (the one with needle
bearings not bushings) this way you keep yopur stock ride if thtas what
you want.

toodles,

Steve
