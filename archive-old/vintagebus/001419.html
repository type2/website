Subject: Re: Bosch date coding

Weird, that note got cut short, must have put some list commands in there or something.  Here it is again:
------------------

A gentleman came over to my house last weekend to purchase some 36hp warm-up parts.  He noticed a thin-slot generator I had picked up for my '55 Kombi on my workbench and proceeded to show me how to read the date code stamped on its body.  I did not realize they were date stamped so imagine my surprise when it was stamped 7L, which equates to July, 1955, fairly close to the production date of my Bus.  He stated that the majority of Bosch products were stamped with a date code where the # is the number of the month and the years begin in 1945, where:
 
1945 = A
1946 = B
and so on
1955 = L
I is not used (why?)

I thought I'd pass the info on, any additional feedback on this would be appreciated.

Now I have to find a bunch of 1L parts for my Jan. 55 Kombi someday-I'll-have-10g-for-it-resto.  ;^)
