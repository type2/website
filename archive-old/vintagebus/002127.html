Hey John,

Thanks for the lighter side... I needed a laugh, perfect timing! :-)


David


John made me laugh when he wrote&gt;&gt;  Reading all these responses about
hippies and their lack of ability and competence to even read a gauge has
prompted this hippie to respond, so here goes:  We hippies know exactly what
those gauges mean as I will now explain:  That one little gauge thingy on
the left that has a needle and says 1\1 on the right, 1\2 in the middle, and
R on the left is the gas gauge, when it gets close to R it means that its
time to go to the gas station and buy some more snacks because at this point
you're bound to really have the munchies!  The big dial gauge thingy in the
middle is the speedo and when it consistently stays below the 30 mark it
means that you are either getting too stoned to drive or that you have now
entered the mountain range you have been expecting to cross, either way, its
time to pull over and take a nap.  The in - set number counter in this
bigger dial thingy tells you how far you have gone since the last Rest Area
(ie, when you put that last buzz on, or how far it is to!
!
!
!
 the next Dunkin' Donuts).  So there!! Don't go talking about how the
hippies don't know stuff and how they don't, uh, oh, uh, sh*t! What was I
talking about again?!?!?! I lost my train of thought....
Peace! John Baker
