Subject: RE: the dead horse to be beaten ( High oil temps on highway)

get rid of the sender!

last weeked i drove my '66 on a 325+ mile round trip to Michigan. this was 
the first road trip since i swapped trannys over the winter. when i bought 
this bus it had a small nut that was smooth and quiet, but i was sick of 
cruising at 52 mph at 3900rpm. (speedo indicated w/ 205/75 R14's) i 
installed a '66 big nut from my old bus and am now able to cruise at 62-65 
at about 3900 rpm. i know some will say this is too fast.... bad gas 
mileage... reduced engine life...etc. 1500sp, 009, all tin in place, stock 
thermostat and oil cooler.

the whole time i have had a berg dipstick sender. with the small nut, it 
would start to flicker if i cruised at 55 for 10+ minutes. now with the big 
nut last weekend it was flickering if i kept it at 62-65 too long. (65 
ambient degree temps) BUT, i was able to grab the sender and lay my palm on 
the case upon stopping??? i think now im tired of looking at that flickering 
light and will be removing the sender next time i take a trip. i dont think 
the berg senders are *that* accurate. im going to try something else... cyl 
head temp gauge or sump plate temp sender.
