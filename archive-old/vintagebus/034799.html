&lt;&lt; I went to put my new bushing in it only to find it didn't have a provision

bushings?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
It would be interesting to know if you can use a 1960 or later shift rod 
guide with the replacable plastic bushing.  Is your bus a pre-1960?  The 
steel spring clip could be replaced by welding in a piece of banding strap.  
Just make sure to weld quickly, and quench to retain the steel springiness.
