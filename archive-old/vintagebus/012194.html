Hey all,

I just wanted to share a little idea that I had that worked better than I
thought.  I mean...how ofter does that happen when we're working on old
buses?

About a month ago, I was putting a stock muffler back on my bus in
preparation for cooler temperatures.  Knowing ahead of time that the
flanges on Brazilian mufflers are alway too large for the pipe coming from
the heater boxes, I cut the pipe off and welded a larger outside diameter
(OD) pipe section in its place.  BTW, it still leaks exhaust here (d_at_mn
donuts and wimpy 10mm grade z bolts) but that isn't where I am going with
this.

In our constant effort to improve on perfection (yea right...), I noticed
the gap between the pipe that runs thru the heater boxes and the heater
boxes themselves.  I think, &quot;I bet that sucks cold air in thru there or, at
least, blows hot air out&quot;.  So...I cranked the heat way down on my MIG
welder and zigged a bead around the pipe to heater box contact area on both
ends.  I have very hot heat now and the airflow is adequate (loose use of
term) at higher RPM's.  Again, this isnt really where I am going with this
post.

Like I said, I still have a pretty bad exhaust leak at one of my donut
connections.  By welding up the contact areas on the heater boxes, I also
inadvertantly sealed the heating system from having a way of blowing those
impossible to stop, crappy, stinky, toxic, embarrassing exhaust fumes up to
my nose.

Now that I think about it, this is much better than trying to seal the
fumes out the other way.  Cutting your muffler from your heater boxes
stink.

Any comments?
