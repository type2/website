This is a neat book, I have it.  $50 is already too much, however.  It can be found with some searching and a few months of patience.  I think Jack Maynard asked me to find him one?  His web address ( http://ucs.orst_dot_edu/~maynardj )is dead so contact me, I have it around here somewhere...

I'd be interested to know of any other books detailing Bus travels.  Please let me know the author(s) and title(s), I have book world connections.  This is for my private collection, not for profit.

P.S. Sorry about sending out the rain comment to everyone last night, that was meant to be private.
