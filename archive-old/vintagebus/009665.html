&gt;are you using a &quot;self supporting&quot; starter?

No, both the starters are the type that have a shaft protruding into the
tranny housing. I have replaced the shaft bushing when I put in the new
(rebuilt) bosch starter.
What starter did you use as a replacement? 6Volt?

After I got home this evening I put a wrench on the generator pulley and
turned the engine over three or four times to get a feel for the effort
required.
I drove across town for take-out italian, and when I got home after the
engine was good and warm, I shut it off and turned the engine over by hand.
Effort is approximately the same as a cold engine. No chance to check the
voltage regulator or run other electrical checks, it's raining pretty good
tonight.
