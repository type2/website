Subject: Chassis to tranny ground strap.

Howdy Volks,

A question regarding the location of the chassis to tranny ground strap. It
is missing on my '66 Bus, so I was hoping someone could enlighten me as to
where the ground strap connects to the trans and chassis.

Thanks for the help,
Gary 
Round Rock, TX
