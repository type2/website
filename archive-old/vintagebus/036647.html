Subject: [VB] Polyurethane foam as bus insulation?

Hi list,

I have read a couple of posts in the archives, an article in the type2
library and a Hoover sermon that described the use of PU foam as an
insulator in the cavities behind the interior panels in buses.

Has anyone done this? If you have here are the inevitable questions:

What can one apply to the body and the panels that will prevent the hardened
foam from sticking? I want to do this so that I can pull the insulation from
time to time to check for signs of corrosion. I thought of painting the
metal and panels and then applying shrinkwrap to the surfaces, making a hole
on either end of the panel and then mixing the foam in one of those small
plastic petrol cans with the built in spouts. The theory is that I could
stick the spout in one hole and as the foam spewed out it would fill the
cavity as it pushed air out the opposite hole. Then when the foam had set it
would not have stuck to either the panels or the body. I could then seal the
shaped blocks with waterproofing paint or resin to stop them soaking up
moisture. Might this work?

There appear to be different types of PU foam for different applications,
what would be suitable for this purpose?


 TIA for any help.

ps if this all sounds like a crock feel free to give me some alternatives.
