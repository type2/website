Subject: Re: [VB] The benefits of women dealing on vehicles.

&gt;I sure do love and admire and am very proud of my VW loving Wife!!!!

I agree. My wife has made some great deals for me. I definatly don't mind
sending her to &quot;break the ice&quot; with old farmers who've got vw's on their
land. The definatly warm up to a charming TX beauty faster than some
goofball asking about that old hippy bus. I'd say it works 90% of the time.
Heck, I had her make the deal on her '70 vert with the owner who was a
Lesbian. When I went to pick up the car, the lady mentioned more than once
&quot;how cute&quot; Lanie was. Gotta love that!
