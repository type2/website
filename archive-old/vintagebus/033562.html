&lt;&lt; I talked to a guy _at_ WW who said they have the grey fibreboard material 
(that's what my front panel are) in bulk sheets which measure 48&quot; by 52&quot; .  
Would this be large enough? I wanted to put up a hardboard headliner in 2 
sections in the cargo area but I don't think this will fit. &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
Our &quot;Technical Bulletins&quot; has a section A5 that shows how to line the entire 
interior for heat insulation the non-walk thru panel cargo interior and/or 
acid and liquid proofing the cargo floor.  The largest wall piece they list 
for the left non-cargo door side is .14x77.56x49.21&quot; and the largest roof 
lining panel being .16x55.12x78.74&quot; of course you should be able to do the 
same job with smaller pieces by splicing them together much like a Sundial 
roof interior paneling.   Eric&amp; Barb
