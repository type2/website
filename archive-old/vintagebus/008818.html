Subject: 66 SC Washer Stuff
Date: Sat, 9 Sep 2000 21:54:58 -0500
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

On the 66 SC that I got last week it has no washer stuff at all.  No =
bottle, hoses,  or even the little sprayer heads that go on the front of =
the bus.  Anybody have any of this?  I know the bottles are hard to come =
by and I really don't need it but would be nice to get it all back!  At =
least the sprayer so I can fill the holes that weather is going to =
inside through
Any help appreciated
