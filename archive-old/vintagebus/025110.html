Subject: Re: Trailer hitch (68-71) and paraffin trick
Message-ID: &lt;371FECBF.30BBCCF8_at_gateway_dot_net&gt;

i've been thinking of a way to put a trailer hitch on the back of my 66
westy.  i had the same idea of the cross piece between the bumper
brackets.  thought of doing the thing where the bumper would bolt off
and i could slip in the reciever.  but am trying to think of a way to do
it so i do not have to remove the bumper.  thought of coming out under
the bumper with a piece of 1/2&quot; thick by 2&quot; plate from the cross piece
with the hole in it for the ball to bolt through.  then you could
maintain ground clearance, or stay out of the way (kinda) of the header
exhaust.  major problem is it isn't removable.  ive got an idea of how
to make it removeable, but dont know how to explain it with words.  (im
better with drawing.  when i look at directions for something, i go by
the pictures.)  :)  anyway, i could try to draw something up (halfway
legible) and send my crude drawing to anyone interested in seeing if it
would work. or nit-pick it on the design flaws so i can fix em' before i
try to tow with it.  :)

&gt; Being unable to find a proper hitch for my bus, I came about the idea to use
&gt; rear bumper mounts, weld a bar between the two, and weld a ball in the
&gt; middle. If I do it while the mounts are on the bus, ought to have the
&gt; alignment correct, and be able to pull off the bumper, and install the hitch
&gt; on the 69 or 71 as needed. Any thoughts on this??
&gt;
&gt; I have a 69 parter on the farm that I bought for the bumpers that turned out
&gt; to be straight but toast, but the brackets were good. Before I realized that
&gt; the bumpers were that bad I tried and tried to get the bolts out with
&gt; penetrating oil, heat and brute force to no avail. Would not budge. Left them
&gt; there half hooked to the bus for months. Tonight I remembered a hint from the
&gt; type 2 list about using paraffin and worked so easy it was amazing. Heated
&gt; those suckers up and applied wax till it stopped melting. ALL frozen nuts
&gt; came off with no effort at all. Amazing! I used bowl wax that is made to seal
&gt; your toilet to the plumbing in the floor. Available at any hardware store for
&gt; about $1.00. Highly recommended. Warning - is flammable (like a candle) and
&gt; messy to clean up.
