Subject: paint off chrome and other handle ?'s
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there!
I'm gonna polish up my handles this weekend and was wondering, How do you get 
auto grade paint off of chrome without sanding? My outer door handles have 
really nice chrome but the PO painted over a few parts toward the base of the 
handles.
Also, my Panel is a 59' and has the thin metal interior cargo - door handle. 
Is this supposed to be painted or bare metal? If painted, what color? Also, 
does a panel come w/ just one interior cargo door handle. If so, what do you 
other panel owners do when you camp in the back w/ a cab divider in if you 
want the doors closed?

BTW, what is a good chrome polish on the market?

Thanks for all the help!
