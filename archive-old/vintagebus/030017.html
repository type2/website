&gt; in my bus.  This BN 2 looks awesome.  The point doesn't even looked
&gt; scratched, but I'm missing a switch.  Is there a prefered place to put these
&gt; things, i.e. I've seen one installed under the driver's seat and it looked
&gt; to me like a factory installation, but I realize the most common place is in
&gt; the engine bay opposite the battery.

====================================================

There are bus and bug models as well as truck models.  There are Stewart/Warner
and Eberspacher...  possibly more.  I'm not so sure about bugs, but with
busses, most were installed on the drivers side of the engine compartment.  A
control cable went up front along with a indicator light.  If you can fab a
bracket and all the fuel line,exhaust and fresh air intake I guess you could
put a gas heater anywhere...they are basically self contained.  I've seen
install instructions for the engine compartment, under the dash, and even in
the tool well of a bench seat model bus.  Like I said, anything is possible.

BN-4's (only Eberspacher heaters carry the &quot;BN&quot; designation) are the most
common 12v models.  6v models are designated as a stationary 55 or 56.
Basically the same design, but with only a glow plug and not as much safety
circuitry.

List member (current???) Ron Van Ness  is quite an authority on the BN-4.
Although his work is all with bay windows, there is no real difference in
installation between a splitty and a bay.  I've restored 2 6v heaters, and his
help (via the T2 web site) was invaluable.  Check the site under &quot;heating&quot;.
There are great articles as well as a ton of pictures off almost all the
models...there are some of the 6v also.   Ron has detailed the restoration
process with a BN4 as well as its installation.  Read it all, it will help
immensely.

Oh....when testing keep a fire extinguisher by you at all times ;-)
