Hi Thom and everyone else,
The 63 deluxe middle seat would be either 3/4 or full depending on how it 
came from the factory. The hand bar should be of white plastic origin with 
chrome covers on the ends.
Middle seats are interesting because I have a walk-thru with a full length 
and everyone says it should be 3/4 but there are no holes to put in the 
brackets and hold down clamps. Again, depends on the factory fitting.
Good luck
