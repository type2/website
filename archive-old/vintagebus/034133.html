The Brazialian boxes were imported a couple years ago by one of my
wholesalers, it turned out that these boxes DIDN'T work in a Split bus
without mods, what you paid Thom was wholesale or there about for this box,
i had some but returned them to my wholesaler so I didn't have to eat it, I
have found another source for rebuilt bus boxes but they are pricey as I can
only sell them outright, no core, I have one coming and am going to install
it in my DD to check it out and if I find it to be of good quality I will
offer them on my web catalog, remember these will be sold outright with no
core!

I spent some more time playing with the steering box/column last night.
I detected some play, which I wanted to measure at the wheel, so I went
to put a wheel on it.  We already knew our threads were buggered, but
guess what?  So was the keyway!  So I had to clean up the keyway with a 
small file before I could install the wheel.

Turns out there was a little better than 3/16&quot; of play measured at the
locking portion of the collar.  That extrapolates to a LOT at the wheel;
we measured it, but I forgot the exact measurement.  I wasn't able to
adjust it out without causing binding in the box.   Is this thing rebuilt,
or was it just repainted?

But here is why you can't  (or shouldn't) use a Brazlilian box, irrespective
of the source: A normal box has 2 1/2 turns of the wheel lock to lock;
the brazlian one has 4 3/4!   It would be like driving a semi!  Strangely,
the Bus Boys guy didn't mention this to me, although I'm sure they know.

So it looks like I'm going to KP with sloppy steering.
