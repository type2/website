can find a replacement cap for it. Any information would be 
appreciated!

Eric,

	I had the same problem with my '66 E-Z.  What I did is I scrapped the 
whole bulb idea and went high-tech and mounted an electric washer 
motor onder the dash.  I fabricated a disc of aluminum the same size 
as the bulb base and mounted a simple push button switch in the 
center, where the bulb used to be.  To keep the whole system water 
tight, I sealed the wiring and switch with silicon RTV (the 
non-corrosive to wiring type).  I wired it like the horn system; the 
wires going into and out of the bottle are the *GROUND* wires (just in 
case of RTV failure).  That was over a year ago and it works great and 
is leak/ShOcK free.  Please be carefull when routing wires in damp/wet 
places.  Marine grade wire/sealants are a MUST.  YMMV
