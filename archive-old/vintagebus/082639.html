Subject: Re: [T2] Single Port Heads

Tom,

They are still widely available at extreme varying prices.

At least it appears that way based on several vendors online catalogs.

Rebuilt from $89.95 to new at $269.....

When it gets really bad, I'll dig out my cache of old engines/heads and 
start selling them off.  Sure am glad I didn't start throwing them away.

Cheers, dave

 I know that they are no longer being made, but does anyone have a line 
 on rebuilt or new SP heads?  
&gt; 
&gt; Or know of a reputable rebuilder in the Baltimore/Washington/Philly area?
&gt; 
&gt; I just determined that my &quot;good&quot; heads need quite a bit more work than I'm 
&gt; ready for at the moment (and one of them might be cracked) and I'm looking 
&gt; at my options.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
