Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

That's good information Eric. I had heard about removing that piece of
tin before to help cooling, but I didn't hear the specifics you have
here. I have trouble with temp creep on my 62, and that was one thing
I was thinking about trying, so I feel much better about it now.

&gt; So I pulled the tin from the motor that straddled where the engine and

 meet and repeated the test. I had to get just inches away from the louvers
 before it pulled the shop towel toward the louvers.

&gt; I took it for another drive on the highway to see what difference that
made.
 I hauled off and the temps were rediculously low compared to before. I
 started pushing the bus more and was to the point of flooring the bus if I
 wasn't doing 70mph. No matter how hard I pushed it, my head temps wouldn't
 get higher than 350 and oil temps stayed around 200.
