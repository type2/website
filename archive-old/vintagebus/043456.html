&gt;Im serious about that - if you live in Europe, or speak German, the 
&gt;old guys who RAN the shop floor need to be interviewd!!

Step 0, find out if anyone has done this already.  People to ask:
* VW
* Stiftung museum
* German VW clubs; a short list of Bus ones is at

http://de.dir.yahoo_dot_com/Sport_und_Freizeit/Kraftfahrzeuge/Fabrikate_und_Modelle/VW/Busse_und_Transporter/

Assuming nobody has done this:

Step 1, find retired VW workers.  Better hurry - keep in mind that 
someone who bolted together a '50 Bug when he was 18 is now 68.
Ideas to do so - the above sources, maybe ads in German papers
(see http://de.dir.yahoo_dot_com/Staedte_und_Laender/Deutsche_Bundeslaender/Niedersachsen/Staedte_und_Gemeinden/Wolfsburg/Nachrichten_und_Medien/ ) .

Step 2, ask away.  :)

Some possibly helpful sites: http://www.yahoo_dot_de/ for searches and
http://babelfish.altavista.digital_dot_com/ for translations.

&gt;Ya know, like finding out VW used parts in a bin till they ran out, 
&gt;no matter that 'officially' the new part should've been put on.

I would almost bet that they did this when they could.  It would be
silly to throw parts out and probably a bit of a hassle to send
unused parts from the line back to the spare parts department.  If
there was enough of a change that you couldn't use the old parts,
then probably they went to the spares department right away.
