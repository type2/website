Hey list,

Just out of curiosity has anybody driven buy his shop listed in the description to

see if it's there, just to see how bad this thing is.  It's in the San Berdoo area

of So. Cal.  www.qualitygermanautoparts_dot_com/Mainframe.htm.  I realize that
it's along shot, but you never know.  I like those Winnebago tail lights.  Those
are classy Barn Door.

&gt; Remember the 52 that was for auction back in January cause the high bidders
&gt; the seller highered didnt buy the bus. Than in February the barndoor was for
&gt; auction again, and it looks like the highbidder didnt pan out again. Well its
&gt; back for March, sounds shady to me.
