Hi Ed,

There are some really good resources on this list... but there is quite a
bit of static noise.  I hit the delete button a lot!  I've been on the list
for more than a year now and there are definitely some reoccurring themes...
I was waiting for the 'lowered bus' thread to go ballistic as it seems to
come up every month or so.  Occasionally, the original post is different/new
in concept but it always reverts back to hippy bashing for some reason (and
I think there are a number of *hippies* on the list)... go figure.

Anyway, keep a good attitude, hit delete, and try and enjoy!


David
