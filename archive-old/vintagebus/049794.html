Subject: Re: [VB] early westy tumblers

&gt;I was wondering if anyone knows the phone number of the guy who is
&gt;reproducing the early westy tumblers and shot glasses.  There is also
&gt;someone who had a bunch of originals for sale.  Any help is greatly
&gt;appreciated in locating either person.


Do a search on Ebay for 'Westy' or 'Westfalia'.  You will find a guy who
sells the aluminum tumblers there regularly.  Don't know if he's your man
or not.

BTW, what years are they correct for?
