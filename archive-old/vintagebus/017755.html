I build the same type spindles that wolfgang builds and have first 
hand expierience...there is NO WELDING RQUIRED!!!and you don't 
have to bend anything!! that would be unsafe.you do have to press 
the spindles apart witch requires a large press an you need to make 
a special fixture to do it.ther is alse some machining rquired.I sell 
my spindles for $250pr. exch. only as cores are getting nearly 
imposible to find.in my opinion my spindles are much stronger than 
wolfgangs becouse I remove the least amount of material 
nescassary when wolfgang over machines for clearence.

when they say &quot;flipped&quot; they don't mean side to side or upside 
down..it means the kingpin assem. is flipped inside out and  upside 
down inside the carrier!

soon you will  see my long term project overly lowered 1958 15 
window...featuring rack and pinion steering,4 wheel porsche 944 
disc brakes,narrowed beam,porsche 5-speed,356/912 porsche 
engine,raised front floors,dropped spindles,irs rear conversion, and 
airride 4 wheel independently adjustable ride hight converting the 
stock torsion susp. to sway bars!!!-cameron
