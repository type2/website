Subject: Electric Heat?

I am thinking of trying a mini ceramic electric heater in my bus this winter for supplemental heat. I have tried a 12 V electric heater like this before and I ruined my generator due to the heater overloading it! My question: Is there a maximum power draw that the bus charging system can handle? It is a 65 bus, converted to 12V, currently running a 58amp generator ( would switching to an alternator help?). The mini ceramic unit that I am looking at is 12V DC input, 8.3 amp, the heat output would be 100 watts and 340 BTU/hr. Has anyone else ever had nay luck with electric supplemental heating?
