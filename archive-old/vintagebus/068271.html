Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Castrol and BP

Thom needs to pipe in about his Synth oil change in the 911.Messy,messy,messy

Oil:Valvoline Racing 20-50 when it is warm and Valvoline 20w winter(just to move around the shop,yard).

Tires:Sears had a General Ameristar cheap.Not an LT though,tons of 195R15 LT's available in Europe for around 80usd.Will get some when time and cash allows.

Beer:Bell's a micro from Kalamazoo Mi or on Thursdays($2 growler refill night) something intresting on tap at the corner Brewpub.

All,

Ok I may have exaggerated a tad...may not like a sieve, but compared to the Castrol it was quite a bit, mostly from the main seal.  I have run HD30Wt Castrol with no probs.

Maybe some oil guru can enlighten us on the possibilites of seal shrinkage/deterioration with synth. vs. dino oil?

For now....I'll just keep on running the piss out of it. 

Beto
