Subject: Re: [VB] Need 67 ignition sw - not repop

Give Gabriel a call.  He's pretty much THE key guy.  Just tell him you've
got a '67 bus and give him a key code.  He probably has an NOS ignition he
can sell you, and will rekey it to match your bus.  His number is
209-462-2851.  I had him rekey an NOS ignition for my bus and make a spare
set of keys for me.  They work great.

67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)


&gt; I need a ignition switch for my 67 deluxe - original is on its last legs.
&gt; I'm looking for either one in great condition (original) or NOS OG. I do
&gt; not want a reproduction unit, as I've heard bad things about 'em. Just
&gt; want an original. Wanna get it keyed up before this one takes its final
&gt; bow.
