Rex,

Don't get all bummed out about that valve. I've been fooling with buses
for more that twenty years (some of that in foreign car shops) and I've
*never* seen or heard of a dropped intake valve. That doesn't mean it
can't happen, but I think it's one of the most unlikely things you'll
ever hear of in a VW engine. The reason is because the intake valves are
constantly getting cooled by the flow of the intake air/fuel mixture. If
it were my bus, I would adjust the valves and drive it some more. Check
it in a couple of thousand miles. If it's closed up again, then there
might be a problem you need to deal with, but I don't think that even
then it would be very likely to lead to a dropped valve. I think what's
more likely is that the valve and seat are just finding the place where
they work right together and you'll start finding less need for
adjustment in the valves, especially the intakes, as you put more miles
on it.

Give that a try. Sometimes things act a little weird until they get worn
in together and an engine with 3000 miles on it is still not completely
broken in.

&gt; '59 Kombi go before even having 3000 miles REALLY sucked. so now it's
&gt; more money and another engine pull. Doesn't make for very much fun VW
&gt; driving. Also doesn't help make me feel good about making any kind of
&gt; long trip in my bus.
