Does anyone in Orange County CA have a rear end tow dolly like the one Rex has made?  Here is a link to what I'm looking for 

http://www.type2guy_dot_com/62/62.html

Someone is giving me a bus without a tranny, and I need to roll it on to a trailer.  I haven't had time to build one yet.  It looks like I can pick the bus up on Wed.  Any leads would be appreciated.  This bus is a junker(crunched front rust bucket, cut wheel wells, no interior or windows), so if there are metal bits that I don't use, you're welcome to them or I can rent the dolly from you.

I'm going to build a sandblaster out of the back half of this beast, so if anyone out there has done this and has plans or drawings please let me know.

Thanks!

Steve
