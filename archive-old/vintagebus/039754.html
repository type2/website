&gt;Hi all;
&gt;The attached Letter to the Editor was published in my local paper this
&gt;morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to write back. I can think of
&gt;dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I would share his letter
&gt;with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to destroy this guy's
&gt;nonsense.

He should read the article in Discover about suvs. They kill people. Mostly 
others, but the also tip over. Buses keep most of thier weight neer the 
ground and dont ride up on other cars when they hit them.

Its also interesting to note that an suv wastes time. See article to find 
out why.
