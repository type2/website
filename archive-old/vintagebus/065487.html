Subject: Re: Camper headliner

I had to replace all of the wood panels in Frodo when I rebuilt it. I
was luck enough to have all of the Original panels to use as templates.
They were rotten, mouse urine soaked and generally in unusable shape.
The wood I used was 1/8 inch baltic birch. The lumber yard I got it from
sold it to me cheap 'cause it was a nonstandard size. 5' x 5'. I told
them I would make due. I loaded it up and was out of there in a flash. 
The 3 roof sections from the end of the air box back are not square. The
are more trapezoid. I think they would be tough to measure by using a
tape measure inside the bus. Measure twice cut once. 
When I installed them my helper and I figured out a way that worked well
for us. Position the front section correctly with the sides up and the
center down. Have the helper hold a 2x4 slightly longer than the wood
against the roof from front to back. Slowly push the 2 sides up. You
will get to the point where the wood is shaped like a &quot;M&quot; with the 2x4
holding the center away from the roof. Remove the 2x4 and it will pop
into place. Repeat 2 more times.
The side panels go on nearly flat so they were no big deal. Again
measure twice cut once.
The 2 corner sections were the parts that about drove me nuts. I tried
soaking them, scoring them, and scoring and soaking them. They always
cracked. What worked for me was to take my disk sander and starting 1/3
of the way from the front, thin the panel to the back end. I went from
1/8 inch to a little more than 1/16. I had the chrome channel that goes
over the top edge to help bend it and hold it's shape as I attached the
panel to the wall. 
Like I said some of the shapes are a bit odd so if you do not have the
original wood to work from I suggest you get some large  sheets of non
corrugated cardboard to work out the shape. Bottom line is that no
matter how you do it the beautiful look of newly finished baltic birch
can't be beat.
