Subject: RE: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - T1 vs. T3 deflectors

&gt; If you read the manual, the J-tin deflects the down flowing hot air to the
&gt; rear and away from the engine. That was it's primary and intended use.

But what about when using the T3 cool tins as was first posted?  As I
understand it the T3 didn't have the tins underneath.  The air from the
tins went straight down.  I know pretty much zero about type3s though.
Everett?
