So those must be &quot;Kangaroo Bars&quot; instead of &quot;Bull Bars&quot;, huh?


For us in Australia, we call pick up's, &quot;Ute's&quot;. Don't worry, you will catch
on! Yes there is a bit of sarcasm in this, :)
The cab roof on these SC's are about double the height again of a &quot;normal
SC&quot; with no air vents on the out side along the length on the bed. The air
then gets channeled to the engine compartment.
Have a look at the pic. I will scan another one asap to show the side.
Thanks
