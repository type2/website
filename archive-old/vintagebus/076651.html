Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

 the samba says the 4th digit if present, is paint finish. 1 for primer, 2
for nitro lacquer, 3 for synthetic resin, but the list only goes up to 3. I
was curious about the 6 too.

the lack of a 164 makes me wonder if the roof was grafted onto the slider
bus and the m-plates and vins went with it. unless the other sliding door
buses out there are missing the m-code, it seems likely, whether the stamped
number matches the others or not.



&gt; hmm.. I would have thought that the 164 should be on the m code tag.  Then
&gt; again, I have been unclear about the 4th digit of the model # stamped into
the M
&gt; code plate
&gt;
&gt; Ya, I'd double check all 3 VINs on your bus.. stamped in engine
compartment,
&gt; on m code tag, and on tag riveted to the air vent.   But you don't have m
130
&gt; (with-out sliding sunroof) which the hardtop deluxes came with, arguing
&gt; against it being a roof transplant survivor.
