Subject: Sorta fixed my Coffee Cup problem

Sorta fixed my coffee cup problem where the new gadget didn't fit well between
the two seats .. lucky me ... MrMechanic didn't bolt down the passenger seat,
and it slid over a bit to accomodate the drink holder ...
Diane
PS .. glad nobody asked for a ride somewhere ..
