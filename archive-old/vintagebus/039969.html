Hmm..

Whats the powerplant?  Vortec V8 ?

I have several friends with full sized Chevys and
Fords that don't get anything near that.  If indeed
yours gets that kinda mileage, hang onto it because
its blessed for sure :-)

 &gt; &quot;I just did my first official mileage check and
 &gt; averaged 20.7 MPG over to Bend (North Santiam pass
 &gt; included).  This means that I get better mileage
 &gt; than
 &gt; the Ford Expedition, Excursion, Lincoln Navigator,
 &gt; Chevy Tahoe &amp; Suburban, Toyota Land Cruiser, Lexus
 &gt; and
 &gt; even my friends 1999 Ford Explorer.&quot;
 &gt;
 &gt; Just some input, we have a 1997 chevy silverado pick
 &gt; up, z-71, etc etc, all
 &gt; the works, : 29 mpg highway (pulling an 18' trailor
 &gt; with a 20'x4'x3' bin
 &gt; (for soybeans)going from Pittsburg to York Pa., over
 &gt; all the mountains, etc.
 &gt;   And, it gets 32 highway, without the trailor. this
 &gt; is 100% true, (its an
 &gt; automatic) we have measured the gas mileage 6 times.
