Subject: RE: [VB] bias plys?

I ran GULF bias plys wide whites on my PV 544. They handled ok, weren't
as weak as everyone suggested, worked ok in rain. More rool that
radials, of course, but looked nice for being 20 years old. I drove my
PV almost everyday I could.
Al




Anyone running bias plys on a regularly driven vehicle? If so how is it?
how
do they compare to radials?    I won't be driving it in the rain/snow so
that isn't an issue for me.
Also I've heard of radials that look like bias plys but haven't found
anything with a black wall that truely looks like a bias ply tire.
Anyone else heard of these and/or know where I can get some?
