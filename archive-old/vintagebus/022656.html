They suck.  I bought one, and had to do another $200+ in mods to make it
usable.  There are much better ones out there which will run you in the
mid-300's.

The HF one doesn't have a very good nozzle or hose, so it clogs very easily.

&gt;Just got an ad from Harbor Freight tools. They have a pressurized blaster
&gt;for sale at $89.99. Hardly worth the trouble to make your own at that price.
&gt;Comes on a cart and includes a filling funnel and a hood. Purchase and use
&gt;at your own risk.
