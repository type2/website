Hi Dan,
A friend of our's by the name of Jeff found a straight, but badly rusted out 
63ish SC that supposedly had only 50,000 original miles on it.  Since it was 
too gone due to sitting out in our rainy weather for well over two decades he 
figured the tranny had to be in good shape.  He had a late 50s panel with 
butcher shop painted logos on it needing a tranny.....   Jeff once upon a 
time was the president of the Split Window Club of N. America and has lots of 
experience with pulling much older VWs out of the woodwork and the interior 
of this SC was in immaculate shape seeming to confirm the 50,000 mile figure. 
 Since Jeff is not too familar with the split screen bus tranny and RGBs he 
asked for our help to get it installed in his panel (Meat Wagen!&quot;) bus.  Upon 
hearing the story of this mystery tranny we suggested at least taking apart 
the RGBs and rebuilding them if necessary.  He railed against the idea of 
bothering to do so with a 50,000 mile tranny, but finally did so.  Turned out 
the RGB bearings were in terribly worn condition more in line with 150,000 + 
miles instead of only 50,000 miles.  Because of this information he went 
ahead and just had the tranny center section rebuilt to prevent future 
unscheduled roadside stops!
