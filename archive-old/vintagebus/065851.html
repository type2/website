&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Best to just wipe them down just before installing and pumping the front
beam 
&gt; full of grease. Also probably a good idea to tag the leaf springs as to
which 
&gt; tube and direction they were put in.  Have heard of some failures that
could 
&gt; have been possibly from reversing the wear direction on these springs.
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb

I had already planned to tag them, using a numbering of cable ties at each
end to hold them together as they are the unwelded type.  

I have a scrap beam, is it worth cutting out the centre section of one of
the beam to aid reinstallation of the leaves?

Paul
