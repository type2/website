Subject: Re: 67 bus reverse lights

  You probably have an early 67. Check to see if you have an early master 
cylinder
in there too. (non dual master). Of the 3 67's in my club 2 are early, no 
dual
system (originally anyways), 2 have reverse lights. Mine is a late and has 
both.
I think the campers were a little screwy with the years. My buddies 67 
camper
has alot of 66ness in it. Maybe just early? Maybe westfaila got them real 
early
off the line to be able to get them out in a timely fashion along with 
regular 67s?

-------------------------------
Are ALL 67 buses supposed to have reverse lights or
was it just a factory option?
I have recently picked up a bus with no title, VIN
numbers tell me it's a 67, but then someone else told
me that 67's have reverse lights, and this bus has none.
