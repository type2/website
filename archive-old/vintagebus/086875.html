Subject: RE: [VB] Good Wiring Harness?

Thank you all.  It looks like consensus points me to Bob at Wiring Works.  I
appreciate the links and the contact info.

I called and left a message to see if they might have different harnesses to
accommodate the differences that you all helped to point out.  When I get
this figured out, I will update you on progress.

Again, thank you for the helpful information and suggestions.
