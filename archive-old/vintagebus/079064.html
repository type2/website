69 bus.



It has always been a special treat to find first and second gears on this bus
and have never let anyone else drive her because of that. The problem is
getting worse. I pulled out today in first gear and could not find second and
had to hit the curb and try again.



The last time I had the shifter out, I swore I would never try it again. The
welded pin in front of the part that goes to the transmission seems to be bent
slightly downward.



Anyone want to give a short course on fixing this problem?



She is a daily driver now and driving me nuts.
