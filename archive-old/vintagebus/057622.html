Subject: [VB] Shop Recommendation

I'm looking for a shop near the Monterey/Bay Area to take my 1904cc engine
to and have it torn down and rebuilt.  I found a couple so far:  VW Cafe in
Santa Cruz and Greg's VW Service in Redwood City.  Has anyone had any work
down by either shop?  Anyone have another shop they'd recommend?
