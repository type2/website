 doesn't affect the pressure on a single relief case anyway, does it?). &gt;&gt;

Everett-

Have you ever checked your temp readings on your gauge?  I tried two different
types of oil temp gauges on the wifes westy and my crewcab that haes been
running hot.  Both are VDO gauges.  One has a sending unit that goes where the
oil dip stick is and the other has the sending unit in the typical oil
pressure sending unit spot near the oil pump.  When emersed in boiling water,
the oil stick gauge read about 5-10 degrees to low.   The oil pump gauge read
a whole 20 degrees low!  This is scary when you consider both gauges have read
up to 250 degrees in both my crewcab and westy.
