Subject: Slobonium stickers
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10101271310570.20075-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

All,

I emailed Mr. Ericson, telling him I liked the 'Slobonium' spot, and
mentioned the possibility of stickers, etc.  This was his reply:

&gt;It seems that a lot of people are requesting stickers etc and I think
&gt;I'll print some up including tee-shirts and hats if the interest is
&gt;high enough.  Actually I have set up an e-mail address for such requests:
&gt;requests_at_slobonium_dot_com  Please keep on checking www.slobonium_dot_com as I
&gt;will work some more on the site.

So keep those cards and letters comin'!

Matt Roberds
