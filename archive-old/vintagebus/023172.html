Subject: Buses in the Shop this Sunday!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey folks...one last pimping of the event...

This Sunday from 10-4 at Volks Authority (1098 Stockton Ave, near the
airport) in San Jose, the Silicon Valley Chapter is proud to present Buses
in the Shop I.  Geared as a relaxing day of free BBQ and drinks, raffle,
and storewide discount on all your Bus parts, we hope to fill Stockton Ave
with buses.  

I've had a few calls today asking if there's a swap meet planned.  Nope,
sorry.  We don't have one planned this year since the event is designed to
help give both our chapter and the shop more exposure in the area.  But
Volks Authority has an impressive collection of NOS parts filling their
cases (sorry, not subject to discount ;)!  However, if things go very well
this year and we look into having the event again, you can expect to see a
show and swap as well.

Hope to see everyone there...if you've got any questions, email me here.
There are maps in the shows section of Vintagebus_dot_com (thanks, Thom) and if
there are any questions tomorrow (saturday) call (408) 286-7306 as we'll
all be over there cleaning the place up.  :)
