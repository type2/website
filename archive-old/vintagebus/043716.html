&gt;A friend has changed from generator to alternator, we know it has 
&gt;an internal regulator, but do not know how to wire it up. It is in
&gt;a 59 double cab with a dual port 1600. 

How many terminals does the new alternator have and what are their 
markings?  It could have just one terminal, probably marked &quot;B+&quot;.
If so, this connects via a fat (8 ga) wire to the positive post
of the battery (or, the other end of the cable from battery positive
at the starter).  If this is all you have, then the &quot;idiot light&quot;
on the dash won't work - you'll need to put in an ammeter if you
want to monitor your charging system, and remember to check the
fan belt more often.

If it has two terminals, one is probably as above and the other
is probably for the &quot;idiot light&quot;.  The idiot light terminal
may be marked &quot;61&quot;.  Connect this to the existing idiot light
wire. 

It *may* also have a ground terminal, which might have various
markings including &quot;31&quot;.  This terminal will be obviously directly
connected to the outside case of the alternator.  You may want to
run an 8 to 12 gauge wire from this terminal to the battery negative
post.  If it doesn't have a ground terminal, it grounds through
its mountings - you may want to make sure the pedestal and strap
are nice and clean (not greasy or rusty) before strapping it down.

All of the markings I mentioned above assume a Bosch alternator
or one marked with common European (Bosch) terminal designations.
If he's done something clever like shoehorn in an American alternator
the terminals will be marked differently.

Good luck!
