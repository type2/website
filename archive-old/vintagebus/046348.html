&lt;&lt; Wiring is not my strong suit, please p-mail me if you can help at all. The

Hi Gary,
Sounds all to much like a grounding problem between the rear bulbholders (and 
sometimes the front bulbholders!) and the body.  Which is why we make our own 
ground wiring harness for the rear tailights to the battery ground cable, and 
why VW began doing the same as stock in thier buses starting about 1970.
