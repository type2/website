Subject: steel wool and aluminum trim
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I figure until it's time for the ol' full resto, I'll
try to make DARTHVW look as keen as possible, so I'm
going to strip the rest of the black paint off the
beltline trim and mount the deluxe trim on the
bumpers.

So I have a cuouple of questions about trim resto....

How shiny was the beltline and bumper trim originally?
I got my bumper trims looking like chrome with some
0000 steel wool followed by Mother's polish. Too
shiny? 

And is there anything else you folk use to refurbish
the stuff?

I started with 00 steel wool, followed by 0000. Should
I do the 000 in between? What about 400 or 600 grit
sandpaper?

There are several dings in the belt trim and the
bumper trim, should they be filed into longer flater
spots? Or just left alone, which looks better (or less
worse)

Also, can the aluminum be filled? My bumper trims have
a couple of deep gashes too deep to file and smooth.
Has anyone welded or filled these with success?

Finally, how do you get the stock hard as a rock
bumper rubber into the alumium bumper trims after
they're mounted. Bentley manual shows using a wooden
spatula looking thing, but no dice. Any tricks? Which
end to start with, etc?????

TIA
