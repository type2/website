Subject: Re: [VB] Elevation Carb Problem????

i'm not very bright when it comes to diagnosis.  actually i usually sound like &quot;i don't know what's wrong, it's just broke, how do i fix it?&quot;  i live along the coast, at sea level, and a couple of months ago i drove my single cab with its 6 volt 1600sp running a 30 pic solex to albuquerque and back.  i passed through flagstaff, which had the highest elevation along my drive, and even when i was cruising around in albuquerque at 1000s of feet above normal (about 4000?) my truck ran just fine.  the engine was built for my 12 volt sunroof about five years and many miles ago.  the engine has been in each of my running vws and continues to be a great performer.  i don't know for sure if the carb was rebuilt way back when the engine was new but i doubt it.  rereading your message and doing as the trained professional tries to get me to do (all problems are either gas or spark related) it sounds as if it's a gas thing.  altitude may have something to do with it but i'm thinking there's more to it than that... meaning, i suppose, that you might want to rebuild and rejet the carb.  just remember this is a girl talking and this particular one is known to have &quot;blonde moments&quot; regularly.
