&gt; The 30 PICT-1 is about the best Solex you can get for a 1600, IMHO.
&gt; 
&gt; It adjusts like most &quot;normal&quot; carbs; no idle bypass circuit. You set
idle
&gt; speed and mixture just like your 28.

Now, is there a source for new 30PICT-1 carbs?  I mean the real thing,
not the &quot;31PICT-3&quot; fits-all carbs (with the air screw) that everyone
is selling these days.

I like the -1 carb, as it is very easy to set up and seems to hold its
settings much better than the air-bypass-screw smog carbs.
