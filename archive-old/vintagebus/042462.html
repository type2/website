&gt; &lt;&lt; a T3 oil cooler.  It requires less tin modification (just cut a slot for 
&gt; the oil pressure sender boss) and has more cooling per square inch than the 
&gt; t1 cooler, but its the same size...&gt;&gt;
&gt; The T3 oil coolers we have seen, and compared to the T1 doghouse coolers are 
&gt; the same except for the pressure sender boss as far as we have seen.
  
I was told by someone i trust that the internals of a t3 cooler are
different that it has more oil passages etc than a t1 cooler...

&gt; &lt;&lt;Some even say it cools better than the t4 cooler.&gt;&gt;
&gt; If so why did not VW use these on thier T4 1800-2000cc engines?  Also we have 
&gt; compared these to other stock coolers, and the T4 cooler has 40% more surface 
&gt; area to cool with than the T3 or T1 dog house coolers.   Eric&amp;Barb

well, as i said i havent personally taken a few apart, but sonmeone i
trust said that the t3 cooler is superior to the t1 cooler, and perhaps to
the t4, especailly for installation on a type1.

peas,

Steve

p.s. search dejanews on the subject &quot;type 1 or type 3&quot;
