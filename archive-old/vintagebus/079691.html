Subject: Re: [VB] Table Question

I don't know what year it's from, 77-79 is my guess. By &quot;swinging&quot; I meant it was mounted on a pole and swung back and forth; that's why I didn't mention hinges. I think they were dark in color too. I think Karl had one in his Westy.

You'll need to narrow that down a bit. Which SO # Westy are you asking 
about? Almost all had &quot;folding/hinged&quot; tables. Some on the drivers 
side wall (some hinged up and some hinged down) and some were on the 
cargo doors.
