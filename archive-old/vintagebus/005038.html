the double door panel/camper rescued last week from the crusher
along with a few others is coming along well
put in large nut tranny, steering box, fixed doors and latchs
stripped out what was left of interior, WOW what a good find
the floors were still in original primer with out any dents
rust only at drivers side cargo floor but not bad just through the paint
all the rest the best i've ever seen
the whole bus had fiberglass insulation, even the floors and wheel wells
all held down with a masonite type product, floors, sides, wheel wells
rear area, really cool and done nice, i am surprized at how rust free
this bus is for 39 years old and sitting out for so long, i really don't
feel that fiberglass insulation adds to rust problems, this bus and
my other campers semi prove this, i am in the southwest.
cleaned the engine compartment, really good shape
original sealin wax red cleaned up nice
battery tray and driver tray in perfect shape
now for my NEEDS i need 2 of the strange pop outs that
came on this bus, e+b know what they are anyone else?
single pane pop out with a slotted lever to hold open and latch shut
also the aluminum trim for 5 of them, looks like the same as on a sundial
or ez camp panel conversion above the pop outs
installind a brand new 1600 from the VW factory in mexico, with duel kadrons
1.25 ratio rockers and stock exhust (german)
will see how it goes, see it at the classic?

all stickers and custom flame job, call for info

SEAT trivia  did the deluxe bench seat come with differant padding
