I wonder if he feels the same way about all the cars and parts going to
England?

It's probably just some punk kid who ruined his original paint Bus...  ;)

Sometimes I think we need another war, &quot;killed by his own men&quot; has a nice
ring to it.

&gt;&gt;I received an &quot;anonymous&quot; (no name, just the email addy) email today
from a list member telling me that I was basically an a$$hole for
selling *my*, repeat *my* '56 Single to someone who will most likely
send it overseas. I know this is touchy ground with alot of you, but
when I get offered my asking price for a car, I'm selling it. I don't
care where it goes.
