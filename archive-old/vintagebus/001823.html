 Hi Folks,
 Sorry I missed friday with this, but saturday is close, right?
Anyway, if any listees live on Long Island, and would like to be part of a
local bus group please get in touch with me.  There are a few of us who are
thinking of starting some kind of Long Island VW bus group.
  Since I'm only on the type2 list, would some kind folks please cross post
this to the vintage bus and vanagon lists as well.
