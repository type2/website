Subject: Steering wheels and Saving Stuff

I cant say it enough that people should save every tidbit or at least
forward it on to someone with the space to store it.  Things seem
plentiful now but wait 10 years from now... hopefully I'll still be
rummaging around for og parts by then but if they've all been thrown
away, it'll be cheap repop crap (I guess that should be 'repoop' stuff
:-O )  anyway, SAVE EVERYTHING.  

Hell, just yesterday, I replaced the old beyond junk continentals on the
tipper with some new continentals that I was able to locate in europe...
I begged the guy to try and transfer the og German AIR from the old to
the new...  ok, just kidding...  Of course, I'm double speaking here as
I had the guy throw away the old tires as they wouldn't hold air and
were unsafe for even around town driving.  I guess there is a limit but
things like old shocks CAN be rebuilt, steering wheels can be used as
cores, etc etc.  

And I'm still looking for a few more shreds of gas tank divider felts...
