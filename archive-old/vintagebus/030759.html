Thanks Ronnie but I think I got it.Two members have been really helpful; one 
of them will send me information tomorrow, and the other one sent me the 
following info (I am keeping them nameless because I haven't asked for 
permission to post their info to the list, hope it's OK to do it anonimously):

&quot;Hey Cris,

        Here are the measurements I came up with on my '67 walk-thru westy:

        Front mounts: bottom hole is 7 1/2&quot; up from dash (right up against the
        windshield), 1/2&quot; out from the rubber. The top hole is 7/8&quot; out from 
the
        rubber (this will probably be easier than trying to figure out the 
angle).

        Back mounts; bottom hole is 7 1/4&quot; up from the base of the 'divider', 
1/2&quot;
        out from the back (from cargo door edge on the
        B-pillar). The top one is 2 7/8&quot; out from the back.

        They are angled roughly 45 degrees respectively. If you need any more 
info
        let me know!&quot;

The information coming tomorrow should ratify this, otherwise I'll let the 
list know about any inconsistency. If anyone out there thinks that the above 
is not accurate please let me know ASAP, before I decide to use the drill.
Thanks for offering anyway.

&gt;If you still need the measurement for locating the childs cot, I just
&gt;realized I still have  the roof cut off a westy that was cut low enough to
&gt;still have the holes from the brackets. P-mail if you want to stop by and
&gt;measure.
