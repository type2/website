Subject: Roadcow Route to Everybus 

Hi VW fans,
I just wanted to let everyone know our route from California to NC. I'll be
monitoring CB channel 17 and FRS ch.2. I leave tonight at 8:00pm and travel
over the Sierras Via route 88 to Carson City, Nevada. There I'll catch Alt
50 to I -80 east. I'll stop about Winnemucca, Nevada to rest. The next day
I'll drive to somewhere past Denver and rest at a rest area. The next day
I'll drive down to I-70 to meet up with the Buskatiers in Kansas city Kansas
for a Rib dinner. Look for Roadcow towing a Bright Green 79 Westy (
shouldn't be hard to spot!) and say hi if you see us. I'm really looking
forward to Everybus since this will be my first and it seems to be in such a
beautiful location.
Safe driving,
Britt
