Subject: RE: Rust

I think the product you are referring to is called Extend.  I've used it with
decent results on the floorboards of a Saab station wagon I had a few years
ago.  I think the brush on product works better than the spray on version and
either one still needs a cover coat. More recently I've been using a brush on
primer made by Rustoleum.  The one for use on rusty metal has (fish?) oil in
it that absorbs into the rust and helps to seal things up.  I've used it on my
bus' roof and haven't even applied anything over it and its kept the rust at
bay for over a year now.  Also they make great brush on enamel paints that are
THICK and very tough.  I get this paint at Lowes, but if you cant find it I'll
find the products on the rustoleum site for you.

bond to surface rust? I saw a spray in Wal-Mart that claimed to turn surface
rust to a Black primer. Is this for real??
