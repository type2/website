Subject: RE: [VB] No start not ground related, fuel pump... won't

Thanks to all that responded here. Seems that I am now down to.
1) No fuel pump pushrod (I'll know tonight)
2) bunk fuel pump, shame cuase it's new (when did that mean anything)
3) a alternator style rod with a gernerator style pump (still would pump
crappy, no?)
I will know more tonght when I pull the pump. It def does not pump, and I
primed the lines with a syringe, gas DOES come freely from tank, everyhting
from cigar filter to pump is new clean lines, hoses, clamps, and I have a
gasket on the fuel line through tin, no leaks, kinks, stoppages. Def pump
related. I needed the info to be sure I had enought rpms to make the pump
actually work, know I know I had to with a starter if not by hand.
I will also be switching the oil filler when the wrench comes. I will make a
new gasket for this as well.
Crossing fingers,
AL

&gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
Even at one RPM per minute the fuel pump should put out a shot of fuel!
