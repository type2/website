&lt;&lt; The problem I'm having is that the ball on the shifter doesn't want to 
stay in the cup.  Not sure if I just didn't install it right.  The shifter 
tube itself at one time was cut and rewelded, it has a length adjuster on the 
end.  Any ideas on how to get it to work right?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
Hmmmmmm, could be you have the earlier shift linkage that uses the leaf 
spring under the shift rod at the very front of the shift linkage, and is 
worn out.  You might be able to replace the worn out area of this spring with 
a section of banding strap onto what is left of the original spring.  Just 
make sure to weld only a spot at a time and quench with water to cool it down 
quickly or the spring effect of the original spring and/or the banding strap 
will be lost due to cooling slowly.
