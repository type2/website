I'm no nascar driver but I seen three mistakes that this guy did.  #1
use good judgement.  As was already said, he should have slowed down
before the turn.  I guess he didn't realize that he needed to be
slower a few seconds in the future.  #2 steer towards the skid.  He
was skidding towards the right, he could have quickly turned the wheel
all the way to the left.  I know it all happens so fast but if he did
this maybe he wouldn't have flipped the car, or at least he couldn't
be accused of not doing these things.  And #3 hold the steering wheel
as steady as possible.  Maybe if he hadn't jurked the steering wheel
as he was loosing control, he wouldn't have lost all control...

Now that was fun!  Especially since he was chasing a 911!
