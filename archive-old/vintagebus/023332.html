Again this year I will be working the gate, I'll be the half asleep guy with 
the Split Bus Club sweatshirt and a aussie type outback hat.  Be sure to say 
hi. 

Everyone gets to squeeze in the one gate again. It's on the South side along 
that small street with the quickie mart.  It doesn't look like the city will 
ever let us use the North gate again.  In fact every year it requires more 
and more work to let the City of San Jose let us use the museum grounds for 
this show, so please don't get too drunk, don't do burnouts on the lawn, and 
pick up your greasy swap parts that didn't sell when you leave.  I hope to 
enjoy this show in this setting for years to come.
