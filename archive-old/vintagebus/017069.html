Clara,

Are there pictures of this feat around.   How did you suport the second bus? 
  How did you remove the second bus upon return?

If this bus ontop a bus thing is true, I am really interested in 
hearing/seeing how this was done!

Heck, if it worked well....   Maybe I might try it?  :o)

Mike

  Clara, I've seen pictures of your junkyard trips. Buses strapped on top of
  buses.  You could probably tell some folks how to drive down mountains
  using engines and brakes with a double high center of gravity.:)

I hauled that down and up a big hill, went in 2nd gear up the hill at close
to 100F outside with a non advancing distributor I manually set to 30 
advance
to get home on.  then over the cascades.   drove slow, took a long time, got
home safely, about 250 miles  :)   that was my 65 westy, pre shiny paint,
corners were a bit odd
