All mighty list,

Are there any differences between kombi, standard and deluxe seats? I
know that the seat covers were different but is the frame the same?
Thanks.

yes the seat covers for commerical are unpleated, for passenger 
(deluxe/standard) are pleated  (often colour differnce too)

the frame difference is only the back part of the back seat for deluxes- the 
deluxe comes with a bar above the frame, the frame has the bit for th bar to 
attach to.
