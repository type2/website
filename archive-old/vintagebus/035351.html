Tonight I had a guy from a professional restoration shop come out and go over
my 64 with me so that I could show him all the things I wanted him to fix.
This van is in primer and some of the metal work done by the previous owner
(and myself but lets not mention that) wasn''t up to par.  I plan to have them
rework some of the panels (specifically a drivers side rocker that doesnt seem
to radius correctly in the center) and patch a few tiny spots here and there
and seam seal the joints.  After all this they are going to paint the entire
thing inside and out in my 2 tone scheme of a beautiful but incorrect L311 and
L312 (sand and palm greens, flame away!).  One thing he said kind of scared me
though.  He said &quot;you have got to be the pickiest person I have ever dealt
with, I respect that, but man... this is going to cost a lot.&quot;  I think it is
insane that a person running a professional restoration business (wilson's
auto restoration. owings, MD) would consider ME to be picky.  I would think
pickieness would be something that they deal with day in and day out.  My bus
project is in depth, that I will give you.  But I don't really see it as the
ultimate show quality job although I won't deny that I wish it was.  Its just
that I have a lot of work, money, time, NOS parts, etc. going into this van...
											...any words of advice from the wise?

Dan (early '64 EZ)
