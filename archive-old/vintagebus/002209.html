&lt;&lt; It would be kewl to know what kind of buses and their conditions that we
all
 on the list have, so if you feel so inclined post what you got.

 I have.... &gt;&gt;

59 double cab, vin 469869, born May 19, 1959.  US spec delivered to Portland
OR. Dove Blue, no other options.  A valentines day present from my wife two
years ago :-).  Body and paint complete and currently sitting 40&quot; off the
floor on *tall* jack stands (http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/uphigh.htm).
After cleaning the underside, it (the undercarriage) will be painted the
original gray.  I found some nice og paint that we took a reading from with
a spectrophotometer and I'm waiting now for the Dupont paint code.
Somewhere I went astray with the original thing and decided that nothing but
original bolts will go back in... original everything else too but rubber
parts (unless someone wants to sell me nice og pieces).  A NOS 40hp block
Ruiz Okrasa will power the thing when done.  Lowered using a WW kit and the
wheels it will roll on are in question
(http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/wheels.htm).


Now all I need is a pickup that I can actually use like that tipper truck
I've been searching for ;-)

(oh, 7 other VWs but non are pre 68 type2s).
