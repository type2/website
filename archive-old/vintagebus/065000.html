No, there is a solid aluminum surface between the plug and pickup.  In
fact, you could get a buildup of particles on the top (pickup) side of the
strainer and then release them when the plug is removed with its magnet.

Oil drains because there are four slots around the perimeter of the
strainer, but there is little flow through this region.
