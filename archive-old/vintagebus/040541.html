POR-15 trick: medical type rubber gloves.  It's the only way to keep the 
stuff off your hands, We've all learned the hard way that it does not come 
off.

&gt;The thing to watch for on this Por-15 is too keep it off yourself (I am 
&gt;wearing some Por-15 right now) and plan on throwing away any brush or spray 
&gt;can you use.  I could not get this stuff to move with mineral spirits or 
&gt;carb cleaner!
