FYI
The bus in the Sony as has been heavily &quot;modified&quot; via some really creative
photo-editors...   Not only is the sunroof deleted from the photo, but there
is no way you could stand on the roof without crushing it in.  The turn
signal lights have also been changed to look like they're lit up like
parking lights, an I dont think anybody would be parking a bus that close to
the waves to begin with....   I have my doubts the thing is even a REAL
photograph at all...  IMHO.

In reality however, you COULD get a deluxe bus without the sunroof or
without the skylights..  but it cost you MORE!   something like 100$ more
for no sunroof, and 150$ more for no skylights...    Which is also why a
hardtop deluxe cost MORE to buy than a 21 or 23 window bus!  Go figger!

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
