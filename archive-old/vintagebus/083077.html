Subject: Re: [VB] dumb question: is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to lower  
  compression?

I've  never seen or heard of an aluminum head gasket for VW. Who are these 
avaliable from?

Like I say, copper head gaskets are extensivley used throughout the high 
performance community to improve the sealing between cylinders and heads. 
Copper head gaskets are no problem whasoever.

&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; Any time you increase the number of sealing seams one increases the chance
&gt; of failure.  Most of the ones we have seen were made  of aluminum.  We do
&gt; wonder how much the copper deforms.  Having  found one engine with pure 
&gt; copper
&gt; instead of the copper plated steel  washers used on the sump plate.  The 
&gt; pure
&gt; copper washers got a lot thinner  and spread out so much as to lock onto 
&gt; the sump
&gt; studs.
