When I heard from Kabayo,
 
&gt; What's wrong with Dove Blue?  It's so 50s-60s!  I don't consider a vehicle
&gt; to be _restored_ unless it's the same coler it was the day it left the
&gt; factory.  Just my own view I guess.

I started the think maybe I got the color wrong.  So I compaired the inside
of a engine lid to the new paint.......not the same.  Does anyone have the
correct formula?  It would be nice to get it right.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
