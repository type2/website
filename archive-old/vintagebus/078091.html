Subject: FW: Jerry Jess update

This is a forwarded message.  Sounds like he is doing much better
ronnie


&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  First of all, I'm sorry I haven't sent an email for a couple of days, but
&gt;  I'm exhausted.  Jerry is doing better. His kidney function is much 
improved,
&gt;  but his heart function is still compromised.  He's back in a regular room

as
&gt;  of today. He was extremely tired today and slept most of the time.  It is
&gt;  POSSIBLE that he may be released from the hospital sometime tomorrow.  It
&gt;  depends on the test results. I'll let you know. He wants to get out, but 
I'm
&gt;  afraid that he will overdo things when he gets out.  All he keeps talking
&gt;  about is what he wants to do on the cars when he gets home. 


 Melissa
