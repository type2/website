It's the round ones...with the little clear rectangle in the side of the 
housing. I can get the exact number off the package and post it. Those 
little housings work GREAT! Nice easy quick fix. Temporary if you 
want...permanent if your like me and don't care.

&gt;You're pretty lucky.  If I were you I'd have a Westy in the stable,
&gt;so if the &quot;surpise&quot; didn't work out, you'd still have a place to sleep...

Very good idea! I've got a full width bay Z-Bed I'm gonna install in the DD 
Panel. I guess that'll have to do.

The fuse box on the truck matches the wiring harness. Hope I can get it 
working!
