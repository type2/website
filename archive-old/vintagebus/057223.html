Subject: didn't do so hot with kelly park

Well, great trip there, uneventful.
Great show on Saturday.....lots of nice busses, nice people, great
atmosphere.
Nice bbq on Saturday (Thanks Roger!), sat in line Saturday night.....no cops
even....
One of the first in the door at kelly park.
Trip home kinda blew, about 10 miles north of King City (260 miles from
home) I had the front inner generator pully come apart, no spare. =(
The nice gentlemen from Aussie stopped and dug through ALL their stuff
thinking they had one but no luck, he believes he sent the box with the
pully in the other car!
Towed it 60 miles to Paso Robles (Thanks AAA!) and stashed it in my
grandparents garage.
Guess I'll go grab it this next weekend.
Do people carry spare pullies? I would never have thought for this to
happen.
Hope everyone made it home alright, and had less troubles than me.
Greg
