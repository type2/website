Subject: RE: [VB] anti-seize on lug nuts?

Steve, I wish it was that simple. As I previously said, several people on
the list thought that might have been the problem with my powder coated
rims, but that didn't explain the problem with the factory painted rims. And
yes, I did wipe a thin coat along the bottom of the lug bolt flange surface.
Hmmm, I'm beginning to start thinking like one of those people that think we
never went to the moon, or the hollow earth crowd.

Have you guys been putting the anti-seize on the threads or on the mating
surface where the lug
contacts the wheel? Seems like this would be where the lug would bind up.

you're not the only one to experience this. I have been dealing with tight
