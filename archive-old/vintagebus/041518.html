&gt; Well its time to pull my 1st motor. I will be coached along by someone who 
&gt; book.  My question is: What replacement parts will I need 
&gt; prior to dropping the motor.
(an engine gasket set will contain all items marked with an &quot;*&quot;.  Much
easier to buy, and cheaper too)

Engine compartment perimeter seals (front and rear)
* valve cover gaskets
manifold seals (If you have good OEM clamps, use those, avoid cheap hose
clamps that allow the seal to extrude through the holes)
* Manifold gaskets (I prefer paper to the metal ones supplied with
most gasket sets. It's worth buying them separately!)
* carburator gasket
Clutch disk
5mm fuel hose (a meter will do)
Fuel filter
Muffler install kit
black spray paint (to paint the tin where the old seals wore the paint
away.
Carb cleaner (to clean all sorts of parts)
degreaser (degrease the underside before pulling the engine if you can)
* Oil cooler seals
* generator pedestal gaskets and oil deflector
* Fuel pump gaskets
* distributor o-ring
a dozen cheese-head tin screws (to replace those that are chewed up)
two hex-head screws the same thread and length as the cheese-head screws,
(to replace the screws on the ends of the fan shroud, easier to tighten
with the manifold in place)
Several large-OD washer with ID sized for the cheese-head screws (use when
tin holes are too large to allow normal washers to work well.  Also good
for the ends of the fan shroud)
motor oil
thick grease (for pilot bearing)
hylomar gasket sealant (good for holding gaskets in place, does not set
up)
grommet for where fuel line goes through front tin.
Vaseline (for battery terminals)
* Oil strainer gaskets
* Small copper washers for oil strainer
* Large copper washer for drain plug

That's what I can think of off of the top of my head.  I'm sure that
several more items will come up after I hit send!

&gt; I can guess manifold seals but what else? Also 
&gt; what are things to check out prior to placing the motor back in?

Clean the engine bay and install new seals
Replace all fuel lines.
Replace the grommet where the fuel line goes through the front tin.  You
may want to replace it with something more substantial than a grommet.  I
use a strip of inner-tube rubber rolled to be a push fit in the tin with
the metal fuel line pushed through the middle of the roll.
Make sure that the oil cooler-to tin seals are in place.  Soft foam
weatherstrip can be used for replacement if needed.  Be sure the Hoover
bit is in place or scrounge or fab a replacement
Replace the clutch disc.  It probably won't need this, but it's better to
replace it now and avoid an engine pull later.
When installing the fan shroud, be sure that it goes _inside_ the cylinder
tin.  It's easy to trap the cylinder tin inside the fan shroud.  You have
to check four places.
You can seal up the gaps in the doghouse ducting with the original rubber
seals if they are present, or use inner tube rubber and silicone sealer.

Have fun!
