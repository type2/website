How about we drop the price thread?  I am willing to bet none of yo uare as
acute , or funny as you think. Things sell for what someone is willing to
pay for them, doesn;t really matter what any of us think is right, and I am
willing to bet you al lhave had different ideas of what something is worth,
so how about we drop it? Too expensive? don't buy it.  Jim
