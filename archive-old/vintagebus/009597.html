wierdness:

with the headlights on the turn signals don't seem to blink for turning
left,
but they do for turning right.   Work better with my foot on the gas (need
to
clean up more groundsand connections I suppose)  yes, truck is 6V.  Yes the
generator puts out 7V.

Clara,
Had the same thing on the 58.  Filaments were touching in the bulb.  Change
the rear bulb on that side and see.  It's cheap and easy to try anyway.
