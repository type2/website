I know what the general feeling on the list is about JCWhitney stuff but
Bill May says that there are a couple of VW loving gals on the purchasing
board or whatever, so this time, I've seen some new things offered by JCW
that I've never seen before such as:

Lots of water beetle stuff

Super Beetle turn signal and tail light assemblies
The jacobs ignition
new engine cases for $349.95
SCAT CW cranks for $167.99
Stock Scat for $147.99
&quot;EMPI&quot; dual 40mm broso/solex carb kit $379.95
The good dansk heater boxes for $66.49 each!!!  (WOW!)
These boxes are good for all bugs, supers, ghias thru 74, and 63 to 71 buses
They have post 74 heater boxes for buses, T4's, and bugs for $149.95,
$125.95, and $139.95 respectively.

I don't work for Whitney or anything like that but I thought some of you
would be interested in knowing that JCW has upped their quality somewhat in
the parts department.  Lately when I've ordered from them, I get only
Bugpack stuff and that is cool - Bugpack = good.  I'm gonna have to get me
some heaterboxes for my 66 bus - for $66 each for Dansk boxes, that's hard
to beat!
