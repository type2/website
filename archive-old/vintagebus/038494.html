  As Chris said, I'd be interested in meeting up with folks heading down
Friday  morning. After giving much thought as to which route to go, I-81 and
I-95 being the two major routes, I decided on Rte. 29, mainly because of the
truck traffic on I-81/95. I'm only a few miles from I-81, but because of
very heavy truck traffic, it can be a white-knuckle drive in a Bay/Splittie,
ditto for I-95. I'm leaving from Round Hill, VA. around 9:00 am Friday
morning,  planning to be in the Charlottesville area around 11:00 to 11:30
am. We could  pick a spot in Charlottesville to meet, or before
Charlottesville is a wide  spot in the road, Opal, VA. There on Rte 29 is a
Sheetz, Clark Brothers Gun shop, and at the traffic light on 29 in Opal is a
guy who sells the best tie-dye I've ever seen, although I don't know if he's
there on Fridays, only seen him on weekends. We could meet there, maybe in
the parking lot at  Sheetz. Chris also says Rte 29 is easy access to the
campground. All those  interested please drop me a line.   Thanks, Jeff S.
