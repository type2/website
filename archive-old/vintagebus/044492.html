&lt;&lt; I always carried a Sharpie felt tip pen and wrote the mileage at fill-up 
on the glass of the speedo. Fill it again at 200 miles. It's hard to ignore 
that way. &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig that is a good idea!  We have been thinking of marking in grease 
pencil the last tune up mileage on the winshield for a reminder.  With magic 
tape over it to keep it from getting smudged while wiping the windows.  The 
sharpie probably will work better!
