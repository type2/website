I was able to mount and unmount the inserts without too much of a problem.  

With the bus on the ground, deflate the tire.  Use something to push the
tire away from the edge of the wheel, then slide the thing on, and air the
tire back up.

On the fronts they worked fine, but because my tires were a tad too wide
for my wheels, they didn't work out very well on the back end.  Looked nice
for a while though, until they started to wrinkle up in the back.
