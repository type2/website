Subject: Re: [VB] New Steering wheels

I know this will make a lot of people cringe but, when I worked for a VW
repair shop, we removed them by loosening the retaining nut on the steering
shaft so that it extended just past the end of the shaft. We then took the
biggest hammer we could find and whacked the nut until the steering wheel
popped loose.

I know by doing this, we probably prematurely aged the worm gear in the
steering box by a few years but, it didn't take us long to get the wheel
off.

Don't flame me, I was just doing what I was told.
