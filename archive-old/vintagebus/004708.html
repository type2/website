Check for a vacuum leak, they will do this. If you are sucking so much lean
air at idle that it barely supports combustion, the opening of the throttle
plate pushes it right over the edge. If you're driving style is full
throttle all of the time, a mechanical only distributor will work okay, but
you at least need a good one. Find an 010 somewhere. They have two springs
and an adjustable advance plate so you can set the curve to more closely
match what is needed. The old cast ones are so much better made than any
current 009's it is ridiculous. Other than that, most folks up the
accelerator pump squirt quite a lot and aim it right at the edge of the
throttle plate to overcome the lack of advance off idle with a mechanical
dizzy.
