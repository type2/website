&gt;  I picked up a '59 walk thru his weekend. Nothing great, just a Kombi. But 
&gt; it was one of those deals
&gt;  where I had to buy the whole Bus just to get a couple parts I needed. 
Anyway 
&gt; I'm either going to
&gt;  sell the whole thing at Bug-O-Rama (or before) for $500, or start cutting 
it 
&gt; up for sheetmetal. If
&gt;  anyone is interested in pieces, or the whole thing let me know and I can 
&gt; possibly bring it to Sac
&gt;  with me. What's there is the body, and glass. No bumpers, taillights, 
&gt; headlights, etc.
