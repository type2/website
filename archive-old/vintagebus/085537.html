Subject: 43 years

43 years ago my bus was driven off the lot with me in it !!

Of course my dad was driving. I was only 10. He took me on lots of camping 
and deer hunting trips over the next 8 years until it was bestowed upon me 
with only 104 thousand miles. It now has 311 thousand mile past it. I 
suppose my kids or grandkids will inherit the old girl one day.
