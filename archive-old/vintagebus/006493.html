Subject: Calling KC, MO or Omaha, NE listees - I need a gas tank.

I'm soon approaching the time where I need to be installing my gas tank on
my 66 bus.  Matter of fact, I could install it right now if I had it.  What
I would like is the correct gas tank for my bus with working 6v sending
unit.  Currently, I have no sending unit in my gas tank as there is no place
for one.  I would be willing to trade straight across (I get to keep the
cap).  My tank has been wire brushed throughly and POR15 in a nice gloss
black finish.  I also cleaned the innards with soapy water and a chain to
get out and loose particles.  It's ready to be installed and run.  I even
have the little spiggot on the bottom that the fuel line attaches to.

I would also settle for a baywindow tank in exchange but I do have some
minor reservations about the conflict I will have between the 6v guage and
12v sending unit.

I'm also willing to talk cash if no trades can be worked out.

Thanks volks.
