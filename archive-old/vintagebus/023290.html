Your best bet is going to be to find a walkthrough bus and section in the
walkthrough bits into your bus, which will involve cutting the divider out
and the seat pedestal.  Not a project for the faint of heart.  There's a
lot of &quot;fall thru&quot; buses here in the states, where people wanted the
walk-thru convenience, but didn't want to put in the work, so they just cut
the wall and installed bucket seats.  These make great parts buses a few
years later.

I even saw a real walk-thru 21-window where someone had hacked the driver's
seat section out; why someone would do that ius beyond me...
