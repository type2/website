Subject: Re: [VB] Most important of all, . . . these days

Yea, don't put Monza's in the same catagory as an equal lenght header.
Monza's are notroiously &quot;sucky&quot; compared to stock exhausts. They sound
&quot;kewler&quot;, but that's about all they're good for.

&gt; Be careful there about picking a good exhaust if you have single carb.
&gt; On my previous bus (1971 stock ) I noticed 2-3 mpg drop (from 23 to
&gt; 20mpg) as I went from the stock muffler to the &quot;high performance&quot;
&gt; Monza exhaust with 4 tail pipes.
&gt;
&gt; Might be that the heat riser tube was not getting warm due to lousy
&gt; engineering of the monza exhaust (symmetric heat riser connectors). On
&gt; the stock muffler, the right heat riser connects near the exhaust
&gt; port, while the left one dives in the muffler, creating a pressure
&gt; difference and a hot air flow in the heat riser tube.
