Shawn,

Your post certainly generated a lot of list traffic. I just logged 
in after the weekend and there were 9 responses to your post, not one 
of them agreeing with you.

Personally, I like them but I thought I'd put another perspective to 
them.

I am an Australian, living in a regional city 3 hours inland in the 
state of New South Wales. Before joining this list all I knew about 
the US was what I saw in the movies, on TV, read in books and 
magazines, etc. America was not a place I had any desire to visit.

Since reading all the things that get posted about the US on this 
list, I now want to visit the States, hire a camper and trip around 
to see what I'm now reading about.

I realise that the trip reports from a relatively small group of 
VW enthusiasts may present a differently scewed (sp?) view of the US 
but, if nothing else, they have changed my perception of your 
country.

As has been pointed out by some of the responses to your post, you 
can always delete trip reports without reading them. I, for one, read 
them all.


Ian
