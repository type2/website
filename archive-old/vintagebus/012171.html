For a header you can live with you might want to try KYMCO's new header called the Kymco super header (surprisingly clever). I have not installed one but it is supposed to be made from heavier guage tubing w/ heavy duty flanges (heater box end as well), all gaskets and flanges to weld to your heater boxes and lastly they claim it is painted with high temp paint instead of lousy primer. I don't have anything to do with them and have not even seen the header in person but it sounded like it adressed a lot of the problems you listed and as you said it is almost exactly double _at_ $119. They also have a gasket set available that is supposed to be all highest quality gaskets _at_ $26.99 this sounds like something I would rather have sealing my engine than the $9.00 econo packs.



Anybody out there have any experience with these two items?

Hope this helps,
