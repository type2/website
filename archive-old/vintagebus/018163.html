One none of my 50's buses ('54, '55, '56) did the parking lights
stay on whilst the headlights gloweth.

&gt; &gt; As was pointed out to me recently, the little bulbs in the headlight
&gt; buckets are only supposed to be on when the headlight switch is pulled out
&gt; to the first click.  When the headlights are on (second click) these lights
&gt; are off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; FYI, I'm pretty sure this is not true of the earlier Buses (50s?), although
&gt; I'm not sure when the change was made.

&gt; '55 Bus - parking lights stay on w/headlights
