&lt;&lt; &quot;Regretfully regretting helping out&quot; &gt;&gt;

Been there, done that...lesser dollar value item(s) but I know how you feel.  
Unfortunately many of us have shared the experience.  I know it has lead me 
to be less trusting in many instances when dealing new people.  Pisses me off 
to give or sell something at a bargain because they &quot;NEED it for their bus&quot; 
just to have them turn around and sell it very shortly afterwards.  Sorry it 
happened to you.

PS:  There was a guy a few years back advertising in VVWCA newsletter for 
parts he &quot;needed for my daily driver 1962 Blah blah blah&quot;  Two months later 
there would be an ad &quot;For Sale: 1962 Blah blah blah&quot;  This went on and on for 
a couple years with several different cars.  Decided then and there never to 
sell anything to the guy due to his misleading ads.  Without reading the ad 
you won't get the feel for the level of begging and shiesterness but it 
really turned me off that he was begging for parts for his &quot;Daily driver&quot; 
when in fact it was something he was building to sell.  Wouldn't have a 
problem with the ads if he would have just been honest about the intentions.
