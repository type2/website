Subject: RE: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Did physics get replaced with fuzzy logic? Small pump, large lines, low
pressure. Volume is still volume, the larger the volume for any given pump
size the lower the pressure. The same principle applies to a little hand fan
blowing in a wind tunnel vs the large wind tunnel fan. At highway speeds the
pressure will build and stay, around town the volume is too great to keep the
pressure consistently hi. The pressure drops are rapid and rises slower. I've
seen too many people with flickering oil lights at idle with big tube full
flows and a factory oil pump.

Hmmmm? (pulls out physics book, checks to see if Pascal's principle is
still there)

The size of the lines does not determine pressure, but it does
determine the pressure loss in the circuit.  larger is better.
