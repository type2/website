Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I just added insulation to the main heat tube of my 61 deluxe, which
helps.  It's over the old oem insulation.  I'd like to put more on, somehow,
but prolly not over the bare tube, so some more heat tolerant insulation
would have to be found.  I have seen insulation on heater boxes, too.
hm....

Hi Clara,
That looks like the exact same stuff I used on the length of heater tube on
my bus also, used zip ties too!  :-) Looks like we both put the seam down to
allow any water to drain and not rust out the tube as well. Great
minds.........

I wrapped it on the very front heater tube section that is covered by the
splash pan also and have had no problem with it dealing with the heat of the
bare metal tube. Like you, I noticed a difference in heat after wrapping it
with that stuff. I also put down a layer of the bubble/aluminum insulation
on my splash pan, which I don't know if it contributed to better heat, but
it definitly quieted down the road noise a bit coming from the floor. I put
a new seal on my accelerator rod through the floor, but WCM is still on
backorder for the brake and clutch pedal seals. I don't feel any air coming
through the pedal holes with the splash pan in place, so it's no big deal I
guess.

Years ago, back in high school, I tried wrapping my heater boxes in
insulation for better heat, but didn't notice any difference in heat output.
That bug sucked overall, so maybe it would work on a properly insulated and
less holey VW.  I have never tried insulating heater boxes since. I have
thought about putting up some sort of a 'heat shield' in front of the heater
boxes to keep the wind from cooling them off too much, but have never gotten
around to doing it. With a gas heater installed, I'm not sure I will anytime
soon. We just got our first snow of the season today. With wet ground, I
wont be crawling under my bus until spring. Hopefully.  :-o
