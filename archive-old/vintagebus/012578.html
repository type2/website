&gt;Hi Woody,
&gt;What are you using to check the starter?  Battery charger or fully
charged
&gt;battery with jumper cables.  The former has not enough amperage and the
&gt;latter has it if fully charged.  You should also take off the forward
cover  &lt;snip&gt;.  Eric&amp;Barb

That was something i never considered, but very important.
So # 1 make sure your using a large capacity battery / charger / jumper
cables... i have seen these cheapo jumper cables that do not conduct
enough to spin a starter, but will allow you to charge the dead battery
enough to get both of the batteries to start it

#2 the starter also needs the outward bushing to spin, so it must be
placed in a trans housing with a good bushing. if not, the gear will
push out but the armature will be pulled against the field iron and
stall the spinnage of the motor. usually this scores the field iron if
it does spin for a minute, can cause hot spots in the laminations of the
arm. and field iron when it is put into service

you can put a voltmeter on the starter terminals as you put the signal
to the starter solonoid and notice if the voltage drops off
significantly. That wil tell you if it is a voltage problem or a starter
problem,,,

Hope it helps
