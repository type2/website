Subject: re:Which Heater

I haven't quite installed my heater yet, but the research I did indicated
the Stewart Warner or Eberspacher are the type to use. I got a Stewart
Warner-supposed to crank out 20,000 BTU. That Webasto one you showed looks
too small to heat a bus. There seem to be a lot of heaters for sale out
there, generally they are missing parts.

 

If you want check this guy's site out..
http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/busbarn/southwind.html Rick Taylor, I guess really
busy, but he sells spare parts for southwind/stewart warner (I think the
same thing).

 

There was a guy, I think in New Jersey, who was rebuilding heaters-you could
get a refurbished unit from him. Then you don't need to spend forever trying
to find all the right parts. He was advertising on thesamba_dot_com

 

Someday I'll get that thing in there.
