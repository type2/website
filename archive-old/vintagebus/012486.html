  FW, grinding trans bell housing if needed, switch the whole starter and 
  starter bushing 

  seems like a PITA to me, I wouldn't bother if I had a VW with a good working

  6V system. I'd clean the connections, and get the thingy for the stereo if 
  that was the main concern.

The perfect solution, I think .. if I could find one that would push more than
a couple of amps.  I would like to put in a stereo and a moderate sized
amplifier - keeping the original Sapphire in place.  (I would just &quot;hide&quot; the
stereo somewhere - I don't know how 'cause I havent thought about it much.) 
Question: Is there a source for bigger 6v to 12v converters?  Or -- Does
anyone out there have plans and schematics with parts types so that one could
build one?

If so, leads would be much appreciated to many list members.

If not, I'll try to prototype one.  I'll let you guys know.  (Prototypes are
time consuming to build.)

Thanks!

Paul
