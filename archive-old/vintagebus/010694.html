Subject: Finally, the tranny is in! 
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

It's finally done!  I finished installing the new Rancho 4.12 12v 82 2nd 67 
tranny in my bus!  After a few minor problems which were mainly my fault,  
took him out on his first ride in almost a month.  smooooooooooth! Thanks to 
Ronnie for his know how and support and to Rancho for building me a bad _at_$$ 
tranny!  I won't be able to make it to the classic or OCTO this year =(  I 
don't have the funds or the time right now as I have to make up for the time 
that my bus was broken.  I don't have another vehicle that runs =)  Well time 
for bed and emissions tomorrow.
