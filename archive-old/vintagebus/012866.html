I was reading my bus manual and it suggested this and boy was that easier than 10 hours with a dull drill bit.  Chisels are the only way to go, but get a good, sharp one.

Richard K.

the master, he pulled out
his small cold chisel and magic Stallwille hammer and BAM, BAM, 2 hits and
it went flying, shook his head and walked off.  
Will trade bus stuff for web site.  (got stiffed by the first guy I paid to
