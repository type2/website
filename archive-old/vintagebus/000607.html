&lt;&lt; Thanks for responding to my post concerning my '71 bus wiper problem.&gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Sure thing!
 
 &lt;&lt;So you think it is the switch, huh?  I turn the switch on and sometimes 
nothing
 happens (most of the time now). I'll leave the switch on and, say, a minute 
of 2
 later the wiper will make a couple of passes across the windshield. Then it 
will
 stop. Then a half a minute or so it will make another pass or more. The 
whole time
 the switch is on.&gt;&gt;
Yes that sounds like the switch, though it could be the fuse box, or parts of 
the wiring.  There is a small chance that the brushes in the wiper motor have 
worn down too far, but to date we have not seen this in any wiper motor, just 
starters, and generators.  
 
&lt;&lt; Anyway, I took the stitch out of the dash (with the wires still on the 
switch) to
 look at it closer and I can't figure out how you would disassemble it. It is 
nylon
 on all sides except the side where the knob fits and it is riveted in 3 
places on
 that side. How would go about taking it apart, and what would you do to it 
when you
 got it apart?&gt;&gt;
Well the switch we took apart was for an earlier 1960 bus.  Do you think you 
could drill out the three rivets, and later upon assembly use screw, and nuts 
to reassemble it?  If so you probably could repair it if the switch is the 
problem.  If not then it would be time for a new/used switch.
 
 &lt;&lt;You also mentioned wiring around the switch to see if that is the problem. 
How do
 you do that? Do you mean using an alligator clip from the hot wire going 
into the
 switch to the hot wire on the motor????  &gt;&gt;
Yes, exactly do that before assuming it is the switch by doing the jumper 
wire from one side of the switch to one wire going to the wiper.   Eric&amp;Barb
