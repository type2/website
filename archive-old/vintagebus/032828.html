    I would like to take a minute and plug this show. The Buckeye is one
of the best shows east of the mississippi if you are looking for a
laid-back weekend event. Theres a $1 admission fee (break the bank!),
free VW trophy show, large swap meet, good food, and free....yes free
camping on site. This event is for you if you would like to spend the
holiday weekend  sitting around a magnesium fired bonfire talking about
VWs.
   The show is Easy to get to , it is located at Jims custom VWs at 219
state route 7 in Columbiana, Ohio. Take exit 18 off of the Ohio turnpike
and head south if you see Rt. 14 you have gone too far.
    I will be there on Friday night driving a red and white 65 bus with
a full roof rack. be sure to come up and say hello! we'll see you there
this weekend.

god bless
