I have finally found a donor body for my crashed '67
It is straight but has a little rust and is very restorable
I cant find the M-code plate on it anywhere and cant ascertain what year
it is.
It has the smaller rear hatch which suggests pre '63 and &quot;bullet&quot; front
turn indicators.
But it has the same large oval brake/indicators as my '67, so Im
thinking maybe '63 or early '64.
Are these brake lights original or have they been put on afterwards.
It also has the air vents above the waist (Australian Alternative?)
Anyone got any Idea ?

there is a number in the engine compartment and a body number behind the
passennger seat (unless someone removed the bulkhead)   Check these with the
numbers in the back of john muir's idiot book.   

Oval taillight were used from the beginning of the 62 model year.   Cones in
front were used through 61, or 63 in euro models.   However, remember how
people cut taillight holes?   Remove the taillights and see if the edges are
nice and smooth and painted- then it would probably be a euro spec 62 or 63
(62 if full bench, 63 if 1/3 2/3 front seats).   If the taillight holes edges
are ragged and not original paint- consider them cut.  My 61 sadly had that
happen to it by a PO.   One day I will weld them right.   God the steering is
bad in that bus.   Anyone have a spare steering lock?
