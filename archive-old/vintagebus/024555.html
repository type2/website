Subject: stearing locks and antitheft gagets

My friends bus that was just stollen had the club on it.  didn't slow
them down though.  I put electrical kill switches on my bus's.  I also
like early bus's with resurves.  the mid point on these is a fuel
cuttoff that only a VW bus theif would know about.  (anyone have a cable
setup for this?)

I have also conveted all of my bus stearing collumns over to use a
factory stearing lock.  The trouble is finding the locks.  I have quite
a few lock units, but none have tumblers that are any good.  Anyone have
a source fopr these? I inquired a few years ago, but no go as of yet.

Shift locks are also out there.  I do not how effective they are
though.  Never tried one.  I do not like the look of the repro's out
there.

I am thinking about a lo-jack for my Samba when i am done.  Only one
real place to mount it though.  Not many hiding places on a bus.
especially for a bus theif.

Otherwise, i think that is all the thrft devices out there that may
work.

Any input or sources for lock tumblers?  The tumblers are stearing lock
unit only parts.  Normal ignition units will not work (not that these
are easly taken apart anyway)

Thanks
Matthew
