This sounds like the way to go, although I still prefer the doghouse
cooler.  Most of the parts I listed in the previous post were to
accomodate the doghouse cooler, not the dual-port heads.  I even suppose
you
could just change the cylinder tin and manifold and run the dual-port
heads with the old-style cooler.  

Many folks swear by the single-port heads in bus applications.
Don't expect heart-stopping power gains from the dual-port heads!
