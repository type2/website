&gt;I also got to use my new impact screwdriver... it didnt really seem to do
&gt;much good... whats the trict to one of these things?? do you need a REALLY
&gt;big hammer, or do you just have to bang for a long time???

For the longest time, I _NEVER_ could get it to work.  My grandpa would take
it, wham on it with a 2.5lb sledge and break 'em loose everytime.  Turns
out, you must apply pressure in the direction you want the screw to go, as
you hammer.  Before, I just stuck the driver on it and hammered for hours on
end.  This way, you can can even impact screws tighter if you want to sinch
something up really tight.
