i have done a couple of these. i built a jig, that
mounts in my engine stand, and holds the entire front
beam, so i can rotate it, clean top and bottom etc. i
have been told you can change the bushings in the
vehicle, but you need to ream it after the new
bushings are installed, because they compress in the
housing, and that is what you're adjusting for. i
bought an adjustable reamer, which will do the
steering bushing, and the king pin bushings. it has
worked for me. a wheel cylinder hone would probably
work, and you can get different stones, so you can cut
alot then shine it up. good luck
