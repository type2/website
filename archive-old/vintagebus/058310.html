&gt; Driving around in the red 61 veedoubleyew microbus through the snow.  The 6V 
&gt; wiper motor with the voltage drop is noisy, wree - ehhhrrnn wrreee - ehrrnn 
&gt; wreee - eerrnnnhh.  The snow swirls around like tie fighters attacking the 
&gt; death star.  The miniscule tiefighters are dissolve soon after they hit the 
&gt; glass, and are schwooped away by the mighty wipers.  vreeeee - errrhhhnn  
&gt; vrrreee -erhnrnn  vrree-errhhnn.   They attack from many directions at once.  
&gt; some straight down, some from the side, some flee when they see the fearsome 
&gt; VW.   Most curve down from up and above.  The wiper motor speeds up the 
&gt; longer I drive. Vree-ern vree-ern vree-ern.   The feeble heater does not do 
&gt; much in this bus, and the drafts are unplugged.  I wear gloves, hat, scarf, 
&gt; coat, in the middle of March.   Needs Eberspacher, will try to fix and 
&gt; install it soon.    The new antenna gives great radio reception, but 
&gt; sometimes I just like to listen to the bus.     The headlights are bright, 
&gt; the horn is loud, the brakes stop it well, and the motors purrs.   Why drive 
&gt; anything but a splitty?
