Subject: Re: Why is backfiring?  (timing, stiff engine)
Message-ID: &lt;370B58CA.9F2F2C10_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

Many thanks to those who responded with backfiring suggestions, most of
which involved timing, crossed plug wires, or the valve train.  No
crossed wires, and the timing is dead on (static).  Tonite I'll check
the valve train.

But I'm wondering if I need to tear this thing down and look closer, for
two reasons:

1) on reassembly, my dizzy drive shaft notch didn't line up like the
books say at TDC.  It was off by about 20degrees counterclockwise.  I've
tried puzzling out the geometry in my head and it *seems* like this is
not a problem, but to get timing right at present, the notch on the
dizzy rim points sorta towards #1 cyl.  But it's the relationship
between dizzy cam and #1 plug wire that matters, right?

2) more disturbingly, this engine gets tighter and tighter.  On
reassembly everything was fine, just got progressively tighter as I
removed end play, added the pistons, torqued down the heads -- but still
was easy to turn over by hand, gripping the main crank pulley.  Now,
after running maybe 30 minutes (with the occasional backfire and cutting
out -- it will not run slow yet) it's getting very tight, and it's not
just compression.  Can't think what it is, but it's getting where the
starter will barely spin it -- and it's not the starter; I can barely
turn it with a crescent wrench on the crank pulley bolt.

Someone tell me about a magic bullet. ;-}
