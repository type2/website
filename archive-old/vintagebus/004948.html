Sunshine (the '64 Weekender Westy) and I drive over the
Santa Cruz mountains to get to work in Palo Alto from
Boulder Creek every day (at least 70 miles round trip).  She
is a little ragged with dirt and rust in the rockers, but
everybody knows when I am at work, cause the only other
vehicle even near Sunshine's age is another engineer's 240Z
(except Carlos' beater pickup 'cause he doesn't believe in
spending more than $150 for something to drive).

Anyway on our daily trip, I listen to KPIG, from Freedom, CA
on my 20 year old Pioneer Supertuner Stereo (now a Mono).
When we get near the top off the hill and KPIG fades, I
would love to put a tape in to avoid the bland choices in
the flats, but the old deck stopped playing tapes years ago,
so I channel hop while admiring the redwoods, the coastal
view or fog and of course those &quot;beautiful&quot; views of the SF
Bay after we top the hill.  I am only good at singing along,
as my brain is too cluttered with busses and aerospace to
spontaneously remember the lyrics.

In another post soon (hopefully) I will update the list (as
promised a long time ago) on the AVP engine and Carter's
tranny that I have been running for a year or two on this
rather heavy daily usage.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine
