Hi,

I recently found yet another project deal here in the Kansas City area
that I am passing on:

1965 Deluxe Sunroof non-walkthru.  The body is pretty straight, but is has
a fair amount of rust to repair.  FWIW it has quite a 'deadhead' paint job
over primer grey.  It has the 2/3 middle seat and rear seat.  It could be
a driver with some brake work and general going-over.  It is missing the
back bumper and front emblem &amp; headliner.  Good title etc.

The guy would like to trade it for a good dual port drivetrain for his 70
Bus--motor &amp; tranny.  Preferably a 1835 with dual carbs, but he'd listen
to what you have to offer.  He may sell the 65 minus the motor, but he 
could not come up with a price.  His 70 was stolen, stripped of the 
drivetrain and ended up at a junkyard where he found it, so he is mainly 
interested in getting the 70 going.

email me for more particulars,
