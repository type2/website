Archives at http://vw.i405_dot_com/ web site... update...  Archives were down
all Friday while I completed updates to the index engine on my new server
computer.

I have not yet updated the messages... July 19, 1999 is the most recent...
but that will hopefully be coming soon (this week if I have time, otherwise
first week in December).

Anyway, we are on a much faster computer now went from 166Mhz up to 400Mhz,
archive searches are super fast!  New software is also faster!  I still have
tweaking to do, going to the faster internet connection (4 times faster --
better bandwidth) on Sunday or Monday night.  Anyway, should see minimal
interruption of service at this point... got all the time-intensive updates
done.


--- TIPS ON Archive Searches ---
---==========================---

    I will work on a better tutorial - how-to for the archive engine in the
next 60 days.  If you can't find what you need, please e-mail me!

    It is best to focus on keywords.  Generic things like &quot;Brakes&quot; are not
best for searches... focus in on &quot;Show&quot; or &quot;Drum&quot; -- unique words that are
uncommon in normal English (or German &lt;grin&gt;) discussions.  Also be careful
how you use multiple words.

   Sample Searches;

        brake NEAR drum NEAR turn
        tires NEAR load

   Wild cards for words like &quot;Signal&quot; so you also get &quot;Signals&quot;:

        turn NEAR signal*

   Think of words like &quot;Westy&quot; and Campmobile that are spelled various ways.
Consider using good wildcard choices:

        west* NEAR interior
        camp* NEAR interior        


Hope this helps.
