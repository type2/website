&gt;I've found I can always run a size or two smaller main jet with
&gt;a CDI installed for some reason which helps even more.

Within limits, richer mixtures are easier to ignite.  Since smog wasn't
important until the mid-60s, VW probably specified slightly rich
mixtures to ensure that the ignition system would always have an easy
time of it.  Since the CDI has a hotter spark, you can lean it out a
little and still get reliable combustion.

&gt;And if driving around town, don't drive it like you stole it. Easy
&gt;acceleration and braking will net you the biggest gains there.

Besides using a tach, one item that gained popularity in the 70s and
early 80s was a vacuum gauge.  It basically shows the amount of load
on the engine - higher vacuum is less load.  Some cars came with the
factory with one in the dash, and I think you can still get them from
JC Whipme.  Some of them have the dial calibrated in mpg, which is
generally true but probably not very accurate.  Anyway, the idea is
to give the driver some feedback on how his or her driving style
affects what's happening in the engine.

The problem with this on a VW is that most VW carbs don't, I think,
have a manifold vacuum port.  Some of the intakes (especially later
models) have a port on the intake manifold for the distributor vacuum
advance, and you could tap into this.  Otherwise, you'd have to drill
a hole in the vertical part of the intake manifold and weld/braze a
small tube onto it.
