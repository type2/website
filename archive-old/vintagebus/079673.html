Subject: Friday: Weird sighting in old movie

I was watching an Israeli film from the late '60s
about a week or so ago called &quot;Arbinka&quot;.
A VERY foolish film all round really about a complete
fool who goes around playing practical jokes and
bluffing his way through various situations his own
antics got him into.
Returning to the point, in one scene he and a buddy
are riding along on a tiny little step-through
motorcycle and they passed a Beetle.
I thought, &quot;Hey, that's cool.&quot;
As the camera continued to pan what should come into
the scene but a 23 Window!!!
The film was black &amp; white so I don't know what colour
it was but it was definitely an early Samba.
Go figure, eh?
I guess the Israelis like a roll back sunroof as much
as anyone else.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
