&lt;&lt; if you order heads from CB get their copper head gaskets, you won't regret

When I was young and didn't know any better, I used to use Copper Coat head 
gasket spray on VWs.  I'd take off the leaking head, spray the Copper Coat 
into its cap, paint it on the cylinder where the head seats, reassemble, and 
voila! , a sealed head!  (Also, it doesn't come in two thicknesses.)
