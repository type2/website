Subject: RE:Solex 30 PICT 1 electric choke/stepped cam (long)

If I remember correctly the accelrator cable runs inside a metal tube, which
runs through the fan shroud. Then through a spring, which has a metal tube
over it, which is held in palce via a circlip type thing, this holds the
metal tube in place.

hope that makes sense.

WAS WRIT:
Here is another question: the tube which encloses the accel cable in
it's passage through the tin is loose, and moves back and forth
together with the cable. The grommet is split, so the rear (RIR) half
is still on the end of the tube as it moves. What should hold the tube
in place? The grommet?
