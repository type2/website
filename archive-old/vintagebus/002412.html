Okay, here's the plan. I just worked up name tags for our group. They will
be very recognizable. They are printed on CD-ROM labels (4 in. diameter with
a hole in the middle) with VintageBus_dot_com in large print and a place to put
your name with some other babble to fill the blank spaces.  Anyone
interested can p-mail me for a scan of the label and details. The blank
labels are about $1.00 each, so a little something to defray the cost and
postage would be helpful. Orders placed in advance will come with your name
and whatever else you would like printed on them (space permitting). I will
also bring some to the show, so if you can find me (look for Rosie, she's
more recognizable than I am) I'll hook you up.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
