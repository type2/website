Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

&gt;I think I have those holes too but I never had the &gt;pull, my '65 was made in late '65 (April) what about 

Mine was made 1/15/65.

I don't know if the 66/67 handles I have were always there. I guess likely not, huh?

Why did they have the screw holes for the pull handle in '65 but no handle.

I like the pull-handle. And the early door openers.

Billy
