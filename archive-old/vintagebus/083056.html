Subject: switched to dual carbs, need details.

Eric,

Just what gas mileage do you get? What is the engine size in your westy?

In theory, changing the carbs should not reduce the engine efficiency, but
improve it. Its all got to be in the set up!!

Your westy must be fuel injected. How does one check the air/fuel mixture on
a carb system? Is an oxygen sensor up the tail pipe any use?

Chris

&gt; Just to add to this, I opened up the airflow meter on my 79 westy and
&gt; adjusted it to give me 12.5:1 at WOT and gained an additional 5mpg over
&gt; stock. Still runs cool, but just sips fuel. It's always safer to jet on
the
&gt; rich side, but if you take your time to get it spot-on, it's definitly
worth
&gt; it. I'm saving about $5 to $6 per fill-up which add's up quick!
&gt;
&gt; Correct jetting can make such a huge difference. Assuming it's right &quot;out
of
&gt; the box&quot; can be money down the drain. Hook a wideband up to it (forget
plug
&gt; reading) and set it for 12.5:1 at WOT and you'll get smokin gas mileage
and
&gt; still run cool. I'm running the cheap 85 octane too!  :-P
