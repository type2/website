Subject: Re: [VB] 1966 van purchase advice

It looks like it used to be a Riviera Camper. You will be spending a 
lot of time used parts shopping. That is half the fun though, 
especially when you &quot;score&quot; that needed/rare part. Have fun.

I would imagine that this is a good price for 500 bucks. The guy is 
about 15 blocks from my house and has been tring to sell it for a 
while. He originally wanted about 1500 but has dropped it to 500 for 
me. I might finally have a van.
