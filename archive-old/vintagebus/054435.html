&gt; I just recieved a bushing kit and operating shaft kit from Bus boys. The
&gt; shaft is welded and zinced, and the back of it has holes, not notches for
&gt; the throwout bearing clips. The bushing is hefty brass (looks like it won't
&gt; fit, and I have to stick with the thin one I already have in good shape,
&gt; seems like its aluminum?)
&gt; My questions are: Should I use the coiled spring like clips for the
&gt; throwout, or the U shaped ones bus boys shipped?

I thought that the &quot;U&quot; shaped clips went out in the '60s!  The one-loop
coil spring clips are more secure, and they also provide a hole to run a
piece of safety wire through to positively secure the clips.  Having gone
into more than one clutch simply because a clip popped off, I recommend
that you run a piece of safety wire around the groove in the throwout
bearing and through the holes in the clips.
