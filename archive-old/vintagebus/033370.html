Wondering what your opinions are on the worth of this manual in general
-- for people who've owned vintage busses before.  I'm probably gonna
get one eventually, but considering:

- I've got Haynes, Cl*mer, M*ir, and even a couple of others, so the
mechanicals are covered, albeit unevenly (the Cl*mer Bus book has more
inaccuracies and downright stupidisms than you can shake a stick at)
- The engine section won't be news, and how much more do I need to know
about the electrical system?
- this is for a standard (so no special components to mess with, like a
sunroof)

..in such case, what's your take?  I have the BBB for 61-65 Type 1's and
it was of some use when I redid the top on my Ghia -- ie, I know they're
comprehensive and authoritative books -- but I'm just curious what else
I might expect to find in this $60+ tome.

Only if you want the best reference manaul.  

It is a great book, and you would find it useful.    

you need to know about anything hat goes funky with the electric system, and 
it is all there (however, for some stupid reason the bentley reprint has 
black and white diagrams, instead of the colour the original is printed in)

if you have questions about the fuel system,front suspension and steering, 
rear axle and tranny, electrics or body etc. this is an excellent reference.  
particularly in the body chater it outshines any other book.  It is written 
for the dealers, and covers standard, panels, kombis, trucks, ambulaces (ok, 
all models)  and has sections on sunroofs,  steering locks, etc etc .

a number of questions that come up about buses on this list could be answered 
by looking in this book.

and it has really cool stuff and pictures in it.   And you can see nice new 
un crusty buses the way they should be.   And guys in suits working on them.  
good for a laugh.  i enjoyed the air cleaner section.   learned a lot from 
this book, and learn more each time I read it.
