&gt;&gt;...there is alot of crap being thrown around on this list and I get the 
impression that it has been going on for a while now. Some people are pissed

of volkswagen owners and can now break them down into two catagories;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;The volks who really love volks and love to talk, swap, and live the life 
of the volkswagen in their own way which everyone should respect regardless 
if you don't like the way something is...The volks who think because they bought an old splitty or rag top delux, 
they are now part of an elite, socially removed group of fanatics, and are 
more caught up on the idea than the action of actually doing anything with 
their bus.&lt;&lt;

Christian,
I could not have said it better myself!! I'm with you, I love ALL of my Vdubs: split, bay, and bug.  And I love to talk about all of them.  ANd you know what, they are not all bone stock, they are close, but mostly they are how I like them.  I have a GREAT respect for the bone-stock folks and for the &quot;56 Bandoor folks&quot;, but at the same time I don't look down on the guy driving the 83 Westy.  The thing I have grown to LOVE about the aircooled folks I have met is their open-mindedness and willingness to accept different ideas, Hell,our whole VW &quot;culture&quot; is founded upon being different.  So, why get upset when someone shares a different opinion than yours, or has their ride fixed in a way that you find &quot;unacceptable&quot;.  Man, we are all different, that what makes us, well, DIFFERENT!  So here is two cents worth from an old hippy:  &quot;Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile..&quot; and if you're not &quot;enjoying the ride&quot; then what's the point??  Love the list, not going anywhere, and loo!
!
king forward to the time where I can truly help out a brother or a sister on the list...

1. . Thats life and people are 
differant...the real volkswagen owners are the ones who love you because 
your just like them...a driver.

2.  Oh... I own a 56...I must be better than the guy with the 
63....thats not an original item for that year bus why do you have it?...I 
can't believe you would lower your bus or build a bigger engine than stock, 
etc...

  I just love VW's. The life, the thought and the action...its a way of life 
no matter how involved you really are. I think that this list may have its 
problems, but... there are some good people on this list who know what they 
are talking about, the other are trying to learn and the vets are here to 
help them. I am gonna stay and do what the list was intended to do, help me, 
help others, and have a good time. We are all Dub-heads hanging out online 
sharin stories and asking questions, a little humor is fun, we are people 
and you can not possible think and talk about VW's all the time... so lets 
just kick back and think about why we really drive the cars we love and the 
people who pass us on the freeway and wave a peace sign, sure, you've never 
seen them before, but they were driving a bus!

   Nothing but love for the list.
