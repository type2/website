List:

I'm gettin' ready to move from the camper/cargo area up to the front cab.  I first need to get the window frames built (I'm dreading those new vent frame to glass seals), then prep the grey hardboard door panels.  I have a set of original door pockets, and have taken measurements off of another door panel as to where the pockets need to go.

My question to the list is this:
On a Kombi grey hardboard door panel, how is the edge of the door panel finished off at the pocket opening?  Read the sentence twice, or three times if it doesn't make sense.  In other words, on a Standard or Deluxe door panel, the vinyl material covering the door panel is wrapped around the edges of the pocket opening to finsih it off, with the rivits holding everything in place.  Simple.  But on a hardboard door panel where the pocket opening is cut, what happens?  Is the edge just bare black/grey cardboard, or is it painted with the same grey paint as the face of the door panel, which would probably do a better job of holding the layers of paper together over time.

Leave it to me to get into the minutia.  But if I'm going to go to the trouble to do it, I'd like to try and replicate the way it was done originally, right?  ?   ?

TIA.

Robert
