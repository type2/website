Michael, The folx at West Coast metric very kindly snail-mailed me a beaut
little catalog to Oz. Its free and includes prices. They also take orders
online. The site is http://www.wcm_dot_com
&gt;First off, thanks for the responses to my rubber seals profile request.
&gt;The profiles in the WCM catalog have been faxed off to my FLARG(friendly
&gt;local automotive rubber guy) and he assures me that he's got a match for
&gt;pretty much all of it - we'll see.
