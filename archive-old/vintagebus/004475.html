Since you are so fond of quoting p-mail to the list I hope you won't mind if
I include my complete reply to you so that the rest of the list may see it
in the correct context and not the incorrect one implied by your editing.

&gt;While I don't disagree with the theory that they were just parts made by

&gt;The truck and bus bumpers had the same part number, but they are definitely
&gt;different. Some things were just installed by people that knew where they
&gt;went, apparently.

&gt; Hi Kyle,
&gt; Yes, but what happens when you install the wrong bumper?  Does the
bus/truck
&gt; fall off of tall cliffs?  Since rims are alot more important to keeping
the
&gt; VW on the road and not suddenly off of it the parts book would have shown
it
&gt; if there was a problem of this magnitude.  Thusly if the crow foot rims
was
&gt; to be a significant reinforcement for trucks and panels only....  Plus so
far
&gt; we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.
This
&gt; would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis,
&gt; westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb

To which I must reply: GET A GRIP. The installation of non crow's foot
wheels on a truck or crow's feet wheels on a bus will not send it over a
cliff. You have my personal guarantee. I know this may shock you, but a lot
of people are running around with (gasp) bug smoothies on their buses, and
amazingly, Porsche alloys or aftermarket rims which were not hand fabricated
by Ben Pon Himself. One would presume that if this caused the vehicles to
suddenly pitch over tall cliffs this would be a self regulating population,
however I have seen no evidence to suggest that these people are involved in
any greater incidence of cliff plunging than the general population. I never
suggested that the crow's feet were a 'significant reinforcement for trucks
and panels only' or that the difference was so huge that in your view the
parts book would surely have indicated it. I mentioned that I had heard they
were for trucks. I think Frankiehil said that he believed they were just
made by a different manufacturer, which sounded perfectly reasonable to me.
When you came in saying that they couldn't be for a different application
because your parts books didn't list a different number for them, I pointed
out a well known discrepancy with parts numbers being the be-all and end-all
of what went for what. I have no idea where or why you came up with the rest
of this stuff and don't care, but don't twist my words to make me look like
an ass. I am perfectly capable of doing that for myself, you can ask anyone.
For an example, did you ever consider than maybe all of the pre-1960 non
crow's foot rims in the PNW rusted out?  Try coating them with tar next
time. 8^)

No hard feelings, eh? I know that you have a sense of humor in there
somewhere.
