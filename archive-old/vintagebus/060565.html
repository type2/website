&gt; I know my bus is wrong, but what should I do to make sure my fuel lines are 
&gt; safe?  I am not bothered by originality just want my bus to be safe.

Hi Paul,
For safety you really need to have a metal fuel line go from the fuel pump to 
through the forward engine tin where it is grommeted, about three inches 
forawrd it is rubber flex lined to another metal fuel line to the fuel tank.  
We install about 6 inches of flexable fuel line between the steel fuel lines 
to allow pulling the engine bcakward apon removing then reaching over the 
left side of the engine to disconnect the fuel line.  No lying under the Vw 
and having gas dribble all over you!  Also there should be a bracket part # 
311 127 525 (Engine section of the 58-67 bus parts manual illustration 6) to 
hold/clamp the metal fuel line as it passes around the left side of the fan 
shroud, preventing vibration having the metal fuel line touch/rub against 
things like the intake manifold.
