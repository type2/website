The full load of acid part of the post gave me some shivers....reminds of
those times when Timothy Leary was up here at the Univ. of WA campus
promoting self awareness and LSD trips...it was not illegal at that time
to use it.  And it was used a lot.  I really don't miss all the crap that
went on in the early to late '60s!!  
One of my most fond memories was a 6 week road trip in a '59 panel in '69
Spent most of that time on Hwy 1 in California.  And one stop in
particular at a small beach there at Carmel bay...we met some girls who
had come from Hawaii to do pretty much the same thing we were doing..only
they had picked up an early camper....we split up some of those Qualude
things and played some seriously fun touch football in the sand with them.
Been awhile since I've thought about that.
Hey...there was a &quot;bit&quot; of bus content right?
later
