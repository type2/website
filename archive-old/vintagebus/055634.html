&gt; I'm both.

You forgot to mention Boy Scout and have a Master
degree.

&gt; Don't mistake concern for stupidity.

I have no doubt you have much concern. I also don't
doubt your stupidity either.
 
&gt; Directed at no person in particular but if you
&gt; haven't figure out that
&gt; messages with &quot;RATBASTARDS&quot; or &quot;Bad manners&quot; in the
&gt; subject heading is going
&gt; to be about the terrorist attacks you might not want
&gt; to be calling others
&gt; ignorant.  Also, if you haven't figured out how to
&gt; use the delete key when
&gt; you see those messages you definitely shouldn't be
&gt; calling others ignorant.

Ignorance is lacking knowledge, stupidity is having
knowledge but unable to apply it. Why should
subscribers to a vintage bus list have to delete
dozens of emails because some are too stupid to follow
the charter of the list, and too stupid to go find a
list or newsgroup that discusses the topic they want
to force on everyone?
 
&gt; Yes, this is a bus list.  

Well mighty wide of you to notice.

&gt;And messages, for the most
&gt; part, should be about
&gt; busses.  

One of the admins posted the charter earlier. Read it.
You'll find that messages should be about busses.
Period.

&gt;But in a time of crisis (terrorist attacks
&gt; qualify in my book) a
&gt; little easing of the rules is appropriate.  

Well this is a departure, now it's &quot;a little easing of
the rules&quot;, instead of &quot;null and void&quot;. In case you
have forgotten, last week you pmailed me this, &quot;When
the list charter was written there had never been a
terrorist attack killing 6,000 people on US soil...or
any countries soil for that matter. The world was not
potentially headed into World War 3. I believe all
list rules were rendered null and void around 9am on
9/11/2001&quot;

&gt;Dealing
&gt; with terrorist attacks
&gt; in the homeland is something new for Americans...

Have you forgotten Oklahoma City? 

&gt;and
&gt; the list is
&gt; predominately made up of US citizens.

So perhaps we need the US Vintage Bus list and the
Non-US Vintage Bus list.

&gt; We all deal
&gt; with it in our own way.

And obviously you and some others put yourself above
the list charter and force others to put up with your
emails, or spend time and bandwith deleting your
off-topic posts.

&gt; Please be patient while your friends work through
&gt; it.

Please be considerate of your fellow bus listees by
&quot;working through it&quot; in proper channels. Go see a
counselor, join a support group, find a list or
newsgroup that deals with the topic. When you want to
talk about busses, then come back to the list.

&gt; Thanks for the tolerance Thom.

Thank the whole list for their tolerance. We've heard
enough. Move on or move to a more appropriate place.
