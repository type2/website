&lt;&lt; Speaking of this, is there an easy way to tell if you have a later (non 
bay) front end?  My 62 has a big nut rear, but I'm not sure if they changed 
the front end.  The front end has a sway bar, but I remember putting &quot;62&quot; 
brake shoes on it when I changed them all.  Can you fit up a sway bar to a 
earlier front end?  
 
 Thanks.

 yes, you can put a sway bar on an early front end.   Maybe I'll put one on 
my barndoor.    After it gets a bitchin paint job.   

check yr dust caps.   If you have ones with easy to prey off lips, it's 
64-67.  if you have the innie/ lipless kind, 63 or earlier.  You may have, 
however, a 63 1 ton suspension, in which case you need to check out the 
spindlke, er to be specific, early spindles are thicker than the skinny late 
ones.  but the later link pins are thinner.
