Subject: Re: [VB] Belly pans

Gene,

If I remember correctly...only buses with sunroofs and double door buses will 
have belly pans.  They are there to add some structural strength.

All buses had splash pans in the front.

I'm sure if I forgot something someone will chime in.

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; Were belly pans originally installed on all busses
&gt; from the factory?  I have the front splash pan but I
&gt; am wondering about the ones that cover the center
&gt; section.  
&gt; Thanks for your help.
