Subject: RE: [VB] bus tool box?

Mmm, just add hot water...

The void in my single cab is probably filled with sanding debris at this
time and is due for a good blow job to get all the dust out once the body
work is done.

As for the tool box, I made an inquiry to the owner/seller of said bus.  His
reply was:

&quot;I have the ability but they run about $385.00 at this point, they are all
aluminum with a stainless steel hinge and center tray. also the handle in ss
but hard to find.&quot;

&quot;At this point I don't know, I would have to make more than one at a time to
make it worth it, it was pressed out and welded together.&quot;

I think it would be a cool addition and maybe if enough people were
interested then the price would be more reasonable.

In the walk-thru section I just installed in my double cab, that
compartment was *stuffed* full of empty acorns, mouse crap, seat
stuff, dead mice, and other unidentifiable schmeg.
