Hey All,

This past Saturday I replaced my flywheel(just put a whole new FW that 
Meredith kicked me)old one was GONE amazing the bus started as long as it 
did!  Replaced the starter bushing put on new tranny boots.  Anyway for a 
while now my bus makes a ugly noise at startup, similar to the broken crank 
shaft on Muir's sound page!  This sound goes away once the engine is firing 
and running, only happens while it's turning over to start.  I thought 
getting my starter secure and replacing the flywheel would solve this it has 
not.  Any ideas...bus seems fine once he's runnin.

Thanks,

Eric
