Subject: my bus debuts on www, and restoration questions

Hi list,

I posted 4 bus pictures of mine on Yahoo today; 1 happy wife and dog ifo
the bus, and 3 in-progress pics to date.  I'm in on the 2nd semester at
City College's auto shop, with more focus and less lazy streaks this
time around. As of now the metal work/dents repair is almost complete,
the next step is prepping for primer. Take a look at it, what stance!

http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/ricky_fu , click on the bus album for viewing

If you look closely at the pictures, you will see on the nose panel
there are the normal surface rust spots, some exposed and some still
underneath the original paint dings. An employee at a reputable local
paint shop recommended a product called &quot;Naval Jelly&quot; for spot rust
removal. Now the questions desperate for answers:

1)Have you ever heard of this item? What's your take? I also have the
acid etching solution that came w/ POR-15. Is it for the same purpose?
Can I use the latter instead.

I've been busy asking around for advice on primer/paint systems as well,
just to find out that 10 auto body experts offer 10 different expertise,
not to mention their takes on spray guns. I think I will go with epoxy
primer, and then 2 staged acrylic urethane. Sounded professional eh? At
least the experts didn't frown upon the phrase when they heard it. They
all gave the &quot;Hmmm. I see.&quot; look. My idea is 2 toned, L469 over L87 (the
original) below the belt line.
(http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~hootowls/62page1.jpg) Right on. If your bus
has this paint scheme, please let me know or shoot couple of pics my way!

Here's other questions bothering my sleep:

2)Should I get 2 different primers, the self-etching primer for exposed
metal that's worked over by Naval Jelly, and the epoxy primer for the
non-damaged area? Or etch the exposed metal w/ etching primer and go all
over again w/ epoxy primer? Or ...??

3)On the non-damaged original paint area, what's the necessary treatment
to insure a strong adhesion for the 2 staged paints? Feathering? If so
how deep.. to the original primer? Or sand it down to bare metal anyways
and etch prime it?

4)For 2-staged paint system, after the primer has been sandblocked, is
it necessary to use primer surfacer? What about sealer?

5)Should I shoot one panel at a time, or shoot the whole vehicle... I
received permission to leave it in the shop overnite for the duration,
and have been lucky so far.. no components missing yet.

Thanks for all your help in advance.

Ricky from SF
