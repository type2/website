Hey all!

Just a quick update on the brake situation.  I took the Wolfgang
spacer to the FLACPS yesterday and held it up to a Varga Brazilian 
master cylinder (part number as marked on box is 211 611 021 AAB).
It fit perfectly...went down flush to the M/C flange, and there
was a bit of room between the spacer and the M/C &quot;nose&quot; where
the boot would go.

So, either I got the wrong M/C in the right box, or the spacer was
machined assuming that everyone using it would cheap out and go
for the cheap master cylinder.  Sigh.  I think I'll end up machining
the spacer, because I'd really rather have the ATE German M/C on
there than the Brazilian one.

In other news, my heater boxes are still nowhere to be found.
One was supposed to be &quot;drop shipped&quot; and the other...?  I think
I am starting to see the challenges involved with owning a Bus,
living anywhere in the world other than the Los Angeles area,
and not always springing for the cheapest knockoff parts around.

I had hoped to get my brake and exhaust systems in order so I
could take the bus to the &lt;plug&gt;Tulsa VW club show next weekend
&lt;/plug&gt;, but it looks like I'll be driving the F_at_rd.
