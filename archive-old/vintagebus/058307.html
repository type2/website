&lt;&lt; I just got my first VB and the body is better than i thought that it was
 going to be but the wiring is a complete mess. I turn the key and absolutely
 nothing. I don't get any warning lights come on but i do get headlights. I
 check the bulbs in the speedo and they are still 6v. The engine is engine
 code AM017279 which i think means that it is a Mexican 1600 engine. The
 choke is 12V.The coil looks like a dirty Bosch blue coil. I was told that
 the bus was running a year earlier but having problems with the starter. The
 engine looks fairy clean with all new tune-up parts on it. it turns nicely
 and you can feel that it has compression. The carb looks like it says solex

 What year of wiring diagram should i try to follow?
....................

if your bus is a 56, I'd use a 56 wiring diagram.
===========

 Is there a way to verify that the generator is 12V?
.................
get a flashlight and look at the top of the gen- use a rag to wipe it off 
near the black tin off the fan housing- there should be symbols stamped into 
the gernator, and amoung them should be the voltage it uses.
===============

 Is there such thing as a 6volt blue coil?
...........
dunno- but if you look at the flat end of the coil it will say what voltage 
it uses. flashlight and mirror might help?
=============
 Is there a way to verify that the starter is 12v?
............
remove it, wipe off the solenoid and see what voltage is stamped into it.
=============
 Should i try to wire it myself or should i purchase a new harness?\
..................
no, and no-   usually the wiring harness is just fine- but there is a loose 
or corroded connection, or someone forget to plug something in.   

get a wiring diagram-
first- check your fuses- are they all there- twirl them.  lights on dash not 
working?   okay- turn ignition on, take your test light- do you have power at 
the second fuse from the right?   you should. check both sides of the fuse.  
turn key off- now there should be no power at that fuse okay- turn ig back 
on, now open engine lid and check power at coil.  you should have power to 
the 15 side of the coil.   right okay, take wire off oil sensor, and ground 
it to the case.  does the oil dash light come on?  hm, cant see- get a friend 
of a alligator clip and clip it to a ground.   if the light comes on now the 
sensor is bad, get a new one.  still off?  okay  could be the bulb- turn ig 
off, remove bulb , use the alligator clips and the fuse with the big red wire 
(alway on) to see if the bulb is bad.   battery chargers work good for that 
too.  or just replace them with some 12V ones, and save the 6V ones for 
friend with 6V buses.   other wise the wiring to power the light is bad 
(comes from fuse at 15, to speedo area, though bulb to wire to back of bus 
through sender to engine.)  follow the pathway

does the engine start? 
does the starter turn? thats a separate path than the dash lights  and 
includes cleaning starter connections and making sure the push on wire didn't 
fall off.

The headlights are yet another pathway.

I suspect your dash wiring- get a copy of the wiring diagram - it's on Thoms 
site vintagebus_dot_com.  One thing that often happens somewhere along the years 
with old buses is corrosion, so a little fine sandpaper, undoing and redoing 
screwterminals to 'reset' the contact, a little dielectric grease, and 
cleaning grounds always helps. ya, and cleaning grounds helps too.
