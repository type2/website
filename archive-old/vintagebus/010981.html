&lt;&lt; He put the CLUB key back in his ignition (again effortlessly) and it 
turned right on. He had been driving the bus with it.  &gt;&gt;

Yeah, old locks are really sloppy.  I've got one door lock that almost any VW 
key will open, even upside down, and one bus that has an ignition key loose 
enough that when I cross railroad tracks, my keys fall on the floor.  Hence, 
the CLUB, or what I use is the kind with two claws that don't allow the CLUB 
to be rotated off with one cut in the steering wheel.
