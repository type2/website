I think it's great that Greg is trying to keep his bus original. I wish him
luck in finding his windows too! My point was that Thom offered up some
glass to get him by for now, and he replied &quot;you are not helping guys.&quot; So
indeed there is listees trying to help him.

&gt; is not like Greg was asking for an NOS pair of safari windows for free, he
&gt; was asking for some hard to find, but definitely not rare, windows to
&gt; complete his bus... and was willing to pay 5 times the going rate for
them.
&gt; I realize that some people were kidding with Greg and that is great (they
&gt; know Greg and Greg knows them), but I believe a lot of these people are
&gt; probably just as apt to spend the extra cash to have all of their glass
&gt; match, or have that NOS doohickey, or whatever.  You would think a guy
would
&gt; be able to go to one of the biggest collections of bus people around and
ask
&gt; for assistance on finding a part, willing to pay a very fair price for it,
&gt; and at least get a couple of favorable responses.   I wish Greg luck and
&gt; hope to see him in Seattle.
