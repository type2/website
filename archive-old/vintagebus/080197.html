Dear Volks,

I searched the vintage bus archives but couldn't find out much, also 
looked at ebay and thesamba, but didn't find out much about this 
particular part. I also posted this question to type2 list, so apologies 
for anyone on both lists.

Before it started raining yesterday I was out in my bus (1969, recently 
revived after a long few years of sitting) sorting through the plethora 
of spare parts I've accumulated over the years-- trying to get back to 
my emergency road kit essentials-- and I found a Bosch Germany Cap and 
Rotor kit in its original packaging (Exp. No. 06001/Part No. CR1) for 
Beetle 1200 years 61-61, 62-64, Ghia 1200 years 61-61, 62-64, and 
Transporter 1200 60-61, 62-64. the number on the rotor is: 1 234 332 101
&quot;   &quot; distibutor cap  is:  1 235 522 232

I recall a thread on type2_at_type2_dot_com about someone looking for original 
German rotor/cap, though this is not the right year for that listee,  
are these rare? If I wanted to trade or sell what might be a fair asking 
price?

Thanks,
Karen
