trademark law is kinda vague, i think a name like this is not confusing to
the general public, the question is if a consumer was to see the name
vintagevwparts, would they think oh this is the volkswagen company's
official web sight for the vintage vw parts,or would the consumer even care,
i think with a disclaimer you could use this domain name, especailly if the
product lines were not vw oem,  has anyone actually had experience with vw
on this?
jb/alabama


, and not too bright
&gt; &gt; if he's tryin to sell a VW domain name (unless of
&gt; &gt; course hes already busted
&gt; &gt; for havin it). Damn tycoons.
