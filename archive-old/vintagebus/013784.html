Yes, don't hide your true feelings.  Look at Tom Mink, first a 
Cal-Look bug guy, then a Ghia Guy, and now he's promoted himself
to a type2 guy with a '64 single cab.  Some day he will reach
true enlightenment, and become a Barndoor Guy.

&gt; beginning to wonder if I'm perhaps a &quot;closet&quot; type II guy underneath all
&gt; this type I facade!
&gt; Should I just come out and proclaim my proclivity!
