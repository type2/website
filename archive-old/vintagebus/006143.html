I had this same problem once about a month ago and after going through all
the usual stuff (points,plugs,coil,adjusted the valves in
desperation,condensor,etc) I found a large power wire on the back side of
the fuse block under the dash loose, the slide on portion of the connection
had crumbled and broken, I replaced it and voila it worked again. I had
missed this at first when I looked because its kind of hard to see but after
I removed the fuse block I then noticed it, really wierd.
