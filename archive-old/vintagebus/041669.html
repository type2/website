&gt; Could that be? Mine is 30332 before yours. They sure worked fast at the
&gt; factory. 30000 busses between April and July? Is it possible?

If you look at the numbers these guys produced in the area of 500 busses
per day. Its easy to see why, if a bus got routed for Mcode mods, how its
chassis# and production date could get skewed by a few thousand.
