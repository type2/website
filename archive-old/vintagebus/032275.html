Very true. To each his (or her) own. But, if some people want to be judged
by a points book...I say why not? If you've seen any of my buses you know
this is definitely not self-serving. I can't imagine the Zebra bus placing
high in any points-based judging. But...I don't think it would hurt
anything. I think that the VW bus hobby would always have non-concours
events and classes too and that the two could get along just fine.

6 years ago when SV2s starting planning the first Familienfest, we had a
big debate about doing points-type judging or not. &quot;Not&quot; won out and we
take a peek at it every year. &quot;Not&quot; seems to be what everyone wants for
now, so that's what it'll be at Familienfest 6 on the 26th of August at
Deer Park Winery in Escondido, CA. (heh...bet you didn't even notice the plug!)
