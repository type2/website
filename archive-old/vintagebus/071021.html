Subject: Bus buying scams

This is definitely a scam and is not limited to the vintage VW world. It
seems that there are countless of these criminals out there perusing the
auto classified sites to find easy marks through which to launder money or
rip people off.

I was introduced to these scams as well as the ever-popular Nigerian 419
scams (&quot;my dead relative left me $1 Million and I need your help to claim
it. Just send me your bank information...) at scamorama-dot-com. It's
actually a fun site that warns people about the scams and also baits the
scammers by leading them on for months with hilarious but
over-the-scammers'-heads e-mails.

Yes, ignore that offer and any other too good to be true offers from
strangers who want access to your bank account info or for you to send back
the change from a ridiculously overdrawn check. Both letters usually are
written with horrible grammar and sometimes all caps. Usually these are as
transparent as Sekurit, yet you'd be surprised how many people fall for them
and lose thousands. Just google &quot;email scams&quot;.

&gt; I have been off list for a while but I wanted to check in and find
&gt; out if there are any known Internet bus buying scams that are popular
&gt; at the moment. I also want to pass on some odd buyers I have
&gt; encountered.
&gt; Thanks
