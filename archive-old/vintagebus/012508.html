The venerable Cecil Turner dropped by my cube at work (HP) yesterday,
and we talked buses for at least an hour, annoying my coworkers,
I'm sure.

I'd like to ask Clara or Dave or one of the more experienced buses to
settle something for us: Cecil claims to have documentation that
states that no buses came with side mirrors - either side - and that
they were all added at the dealers.  I countered that that was absurd,
and that the sheer labor of adding mirrors to thousands and thousands of
buses at the dealers would be a major chore.

Can anyone settle this?  He'll be back at the Roseville site on Friday.

Thom
