all this talk about 12v conversions and fuel guages...as far as i can
remember, when i did my conversion on my 64,the fuel guage is original &quot;6v&quot;.It
doesnt need to be changed. The sending unit is the culprit.Ive been driving my
64 daily for 7 years and havent had a problem with my fuel guage, asside from
not paying attention and suddenly stalling out from lack of fuel.....
