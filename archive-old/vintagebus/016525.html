There's a reason that there are no pix of inte cargo area - it's UGLY!
I have about 1/4 of the house paint stripped, and haven't done anything
else to it.  I'm going to install panels similar to the ones in the front,
to kinda clean up the inside, then that's it.  Oh, and some dynamat-clone
stuff over the engine and transmission area, to help knock down the noise.

&gt; Did you finish off the interior at all ?
&gt; i've only seen pics of the exterior.
