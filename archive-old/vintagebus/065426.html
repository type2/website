Subject: Child's cot... anybody..anybody..Bueller?

A big hearty wazzzzup to all the bus peeps =)

I've been lurking for quite a few months now..and I have that age old question for you bus folks.

Anybody got a childs cot for sale?  Preferably looking for a splitty cot but will go for a late westy cot with the telescopic poles.

My 3(almost 4) year old is getting to big to be sleeping with Mom and me- along with the new one which is almost a year old now.  We are planning on Havasu in January and I need to work out storage and sleeping arrangements in advance.

If all else fails...I will be attempting to make one out of pipe or conduit....or something of the like to support the weight.

Later,
