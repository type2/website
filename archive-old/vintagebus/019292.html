You have to pull the hubcaps off your rims and look
for a little &quot;crow's foot&quot; type indentions on the rim
near the lug nut holes. This should give you some
answers. 

While you're down there, look to see if your splash
pans are installed properly, or are those belly pans?
How many barndoors on a double barndoor bus? I forget.

As far as the seat thing goes, I believe the 2/3
middle was standard on walk-thru busses and the
full-length middle seat on non-walk-throughs. 

Although you could order a full-length middle seat
option in a walk-through bus if you wanted. Look on
the ulkhead behind the passenger (shotgun) seat. There
is a metal plate with varying numbers on it.

Go to www.vintagebus_dot_com and go to the bus registry.
register your bus in there (you'll need all the
numbers, in order off this plate as well as your
engine and VIN serial numbers.)

Then the site magically spits back all sorts of neat
information about the options your specific bus was
ordered with.

&gt; I have noticed that there are two different middle

&gt; buses: a 3/4 seat and a full seat.  Is this a
&gt; different year type thing?  
&gt; How can I find which seat came in my bus orignally?
&gt; Thanks,
