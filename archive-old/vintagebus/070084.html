Subject: 9-PIN conversion and #559 flasher

Hi there,

I am getting rid of the 9-PIN box using Matt's instructions for replacing it 
with 4 SPDT relays and a #559 flasher, method #2.

Link: http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html

&gt;If you have a 12v VW and use a #559 flasher, you can get an exact duplicate 
&gt;of original functionality.&lt;

Small question here:
Basically would a #550 flasher do the same thing?

I went to NAPA yesterday and they said that they no longer carry a #559, but 
a #550 is the same thing but carries more amperage.  Both are canister style 
thermal contact flashers so I cannot see a difference at all?

Any input is appreciated.  Again I think a #550 will work fine but want to 
make sure.

*Big thanks to Matt for figuring out this method.  The SPDT relays are 
really a great alternative!  After working with them relays rock!

Thanks,
Adrian &quot;tangled in wires&quot; Pillow
