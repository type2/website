&gt; Westfalia never offered a floor until 65 I believe.
&gt; Ask todd s. about that one.
&gt; Todd, where are you?

AFAIK the first Westy tent with a floor was the &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; or
&quot;Drive-Away&quot; tent offered for the '68 models.  That tent was also the
first Westy tent (since at least mid-50's) with an external frame.  In
fact the two features are probably related.
