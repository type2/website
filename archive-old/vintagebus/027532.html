&gt;It does sound sketchy - you don't have &quot;gaskets&quot;! 

Well, he showed me what looked like a thin ring around the inside of the big
circle the valves are in, (highly technical terminology ;-) which was broken.

It's a 1500cc, so single port.  Up here in Canada the piston &amp; cylinder set
is closer to $200 - it's going to cost me $100 min to rebuild the heads, prob'ly
another $200-$250 to replace the cracked one, depending whether I go with a
new one or a rebuilt.  Considering the whole motor cost me $500, turn-key with
everything, this is getting kind of pricey.  But I'll do what I have to.  Guess
I'll just wait until I hear back from the machine shop Monday.

Thanks for the advice,
Diana    

&gt;
&gt;Also, a new set of Pistons and Cyliners is a little over $100 - just
&gt;replace 'em.  Re-welding the head probably isn't going to buy you much - is

&gt;this single port or dual port?

&gt;heads
&gt;&gt;have been rebuilt before, and they say they might be able to fix the cracked

&gt;&gt;head.  Is this sketchy?
