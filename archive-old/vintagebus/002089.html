This is not for faint of heart, and i have never done a complete frame swap,
but i recently did the front of the 56 from just behind the first outrigger
to the nose,seat area and bulk head included. this is not a fun job, you
have to rember when you cut out that frame area it goona try to collapse,
more so on the sunroofs models. We installed aproximatley 200ft of tubing
inside this 56 not to mention braces to the floor. My suggestion is replace
only the damaged sections not the whole frame, one section at a time,brace ,
brace , and brace more.This one area of restoration the overkill is good.
Otherwise you have a large mess on your hands.I would think long and hard
before attempting a full frame replacement, and it takes a helluva lot to
deter me from what i do. Ask Thom he is in the middle of doing some frame
sectioning and its nothing , i repeat nothing like a bug. Oh if attempted
and it does mess up , i want no part of it, i'm getting enough of other
peoples attempts at restoration and frankly those are gonna cost alot more
to to.
No offence meant to anyone i feel like crap today, stressed to the max , and
just generaly in a crappy mood , and also on presperciption drugs ,,Grin ,
