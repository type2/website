Subject: Cooroless over paint?
Date: Mon, 2 Apr 2001 09:15:44 -0400
Message-ID: &lt;FAEHJIOPEFOPHPFCIKAJMEFNCDAA.alalumia_at_surefit_dot_net&gt;
Importance: Normal

I have noticed/read that POR-15 doesn't like to go over paint. Is coorless
better for this application? I plan to wire brush (power) and/or sandblast
my rusted areas, which are small spots on the floor. Want to spray the
entire (sanded to 80) floor and the cleaned up rust (probably baremetal
spots) with one product, then paint to stock. Is POR or cooroless a better
choice?
