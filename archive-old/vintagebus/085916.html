  Today, Sunday, I am back from the Hospital. Moving a little slow, but speech
and leg and arm are OK. I really appreciate all your thoughts and prayers, I
still do. It will take some time to type this message to all of you, but I
must do this myself. Many of you sent cards as well. Have no idea if I can
respond to all of you, but I will do my very best.

Bless all of you so much and thanks, I will see some of you soon at the next
VW event in Phoenix, uj
