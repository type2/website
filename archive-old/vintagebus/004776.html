Yeah - I know I'm jilting myself by taking the bus on deliveries but I just
love driving it so much that I'm doing it anyway.  It's just the small loads
here and there - screw those 20 foot timbers and sheetrock.  I won't beat my
bus up that bad.  I must say though, I'm finding more and more that a single
or double cab is looking practical on a daily basis. :-)  I would really be
tempted to trade my 67 straight across for a single cab in good shape. (I
get to keep the trans but I'd let the engine go.)  Just thinking out loud
you know...
