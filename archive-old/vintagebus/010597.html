Subject: Re: [VB] Reverse light disconnects
To: dude_at_zero.failsure_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I would go for the disconnects.   I am intending to put reverse lights on my 
buses, mounted to the bumper, and was planning on a quick disconnect thing.   
Like the oil pressure sender that came with the screw on for the wires- 
screwed on the push on things, and I push on the wires.

reverse lights seem like they could be nice.

 I like to pull off the bumper from the bus when I have to remove the engine.
 It makes it a lot easier to get the thing out from under the bus :-)  I ran
 into trouble when trying to pull the bumper off the Westy.  One, the driver's
 side splash pan's mount to the body was spinning loose.  Two, the reverse
 light wiring.  My Westy doesn't have the usual reverse light setup for '67,
 it's got a set mounted on the bumper, installed by the dealer.
 
 Some might remember that I posted to the list saying I had cut the wires,
 thinking the lights a PO hack.  That's still true.  I was going to put it all
 back, when I arrived at a thought -- why not put quick-disconnects on the 
 wiring so I can take off the bumper without cutting the wires?  The thing is,
 the disconnects must lie outside and exposed to the elements, because they 
will
 not fit through the small hole in the body allocated for the wires.  I have
 some &quot;insulated&quot; ones, completely covered in plastic that seem pretty tight
 together.
 
 Before I do this, does anybody have a better way?  I'm prepared to have to
 replace these every couple years or so, but if there is a better solution...
 
 It's just a single wire to each light.
