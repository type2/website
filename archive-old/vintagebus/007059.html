Bill:

Does this Bus still have reduction boxes? If you try to raise a Bus up to
stock height that is equipped with a swing axle lowing kit, then you will
have camber problems.

Thank You.

&gt; &lt;&lt; After raising it to stock the bus is still extremely pidgeon toed. The
&gt; tires ride on the outer edges. The bus is dead even from front to back so
I
&gt; couldn't have raised it too high in the rear. I have driven it and that
&gt; didn't help. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Bill,
&gt; For all stock swing axle VWs this is the norm when no load is in the VW
and
&gt; not helped when the stock interior is removed.  So install the stock
interior
&gt; or even a camper/Westie interior which is heavier, tools and spare parts
will
&gt; help lower it naturally.  If you have a SO or a compleat family adding
them
&gt; on board will definitely help.  If it turns out you are not going to do
any
&gt; of this, taking it down a notch in the rear would probably a good idea.
