&gt;Specs for those valves as stated in Without Guesswork for the 1500cc
&gt;engine list a load value for the oil pressure relief valve at 12.3-16 lbs.
&gt;and for the oil pressure control valve at 6.3-7.9 lbs.  How do these
&gt;cryptic numbers apply to an engine at operating oil pressure ?

I think they're talking about a bench test of the spring during engine
overhaul.  You take the spring out of the engine, apply a certain weight
to it, and its compressed length should be within spec.  Equivalently,
you see how much weight it takes to compress it to a given length.

The '69 Without Guesswork says 7.6 kg (17 lb) for a 24 mm spring length
on the oil pressure relief valve.  This would apply to a 1500 with just
a relief valve.

The '72 Without Guesswork gives the numbers you cite above.  The oil
pressure relief spring is supposed to compress to 1.73 in with a 12.3-16
lb load, and the oil pressure control spring is supposed to compress to
0.795 in with a 6.8-8.4 lb load.  These numbers are for 1600s with a
relief and a control valve.  Stock, I don't think there was any such
thing as a 1500 with two valves.

If you knew the free length of the spring, and wanted to assume that the
springs are linear, you could work out the spring rate.  Then, knowing
the surface area of the piston in the valve, you might be able to relate
that and the spring rate to oil pressure.
