John,
     I don't believe you can get new parts, short of going to VDO or a speedo 
shop and giving them the appropriate limb. ( arm or  leg), they also may 
remind you that tinkering with you speedo is against the law.  I myself have 
lucky enough to have extra speedos for parts.  I find it hard to believe that 
you could break a needle, due to the fact that the needle is magnetically 
driven, this is how and why you can back you bus up without killing the 
needle. 
     I'm not quite sure what VW used to lubricate their speedo's.  I've 
always thought that it might be whale oil or some other type of animal fat 
:).  Seems whatever they used turns into a solid mass of goo after 30 or 40 
years, this can cause massive problems.  I usually relube them with white 
grease/luberplate.  As for the striped sound.  The gears for the speedo 
pretty much link to the speedo cable and the magnetic drive, which means the 
speedo either usually works or it doesn't.  You didn't mention if the 
odometer works.  The gears for it can glitch and give you needle hop.  But 
you could spend more time guessing than it would to get it a part and see the 
problem.
                                                                   Peace,
