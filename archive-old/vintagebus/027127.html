No need to panic. You need to get an oil pump puller. They pull the pump
out of the case without damaging the pump or case. You can get them from
most of the VW parts places. Probably some of the list member parts
places have them. Check the case after you get the pump out and file off
any burrs you raised with your screwdriver.

Now you know why all the books say to not pry the oil pump out 8^).
