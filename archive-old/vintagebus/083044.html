Subject: Re: [VB] More on 356 Porsche Pulley and ramblings

The spacers have round inside diameters. Look just like a thin large diameter
washer.

I was amazed that everything fit together like a glove.

    Used my old washers too


  hello Chris  something doesnt sound right here   were your old spacers the
type with the inside opening two flat sides and the other part is round  or
they like the VW spacers in that they are round all the way around  on the
inside part . All of the porsche pulleys I have you have to get the center hub
, the two halfs and the spacers   you can reuse the Vw outer cover and
gen.nut.  later  Mark Dearing
