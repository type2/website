&lt;&lt; does anyone on the list cut keys from code for the splits???? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jb,
You might try Gabriel's in S. Cal. since he deals in VW locks and keys or try 
a oldtimer locksmith in your area.  Just make sure that you have the keys cut 
to the code not your old worn out key!  Makes a huge differance!    Eric&amp;Barb
