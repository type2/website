Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

Hey,  try going to http://23window_dot_com then click on tech tips, then
click on interiors. There's a pretty good method there for removing
steering wheels. It worked well for me and without damage to the wheel.

&gt; I tried to remove my steering wheel all this weekend and i was unable 
&gt; to do it.
&gt; I had checked 
&gt; the type2 archives several times and tried several different methods 
&gt; and i was
&gt; still unable to 
&gt; remove my steering wheel.. I would like to replace my steering wheel 
&gt; as mine is
&gt; in really bad 
&gt; condition. I am at the point that i am willing to pay someone to 
&gt; remove my
&gt; steering wheel for 
&gt; me. Please email me if you can help i live in Pomona California.
