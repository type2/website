Subject: Re: How much air ??

At one car wash where all money went to the kids
from Belarus on a health respite in the US, only
a few were cheapskates. One guy gave me a handful
of change and a single dollar bill. He waits to
wash his car until events like this. A couple of
people gave $100. One lady handed me $30 after
she had paid $20, since it was so hot out that
day. It all evens out, eventually, and the kids
had a lot of fun as well, and got to see some
cars they would never see in their home country.

Treat people well, and it will come back to you.

Jeff - it's Friday, isn't it?

&gt;&gt; In high school, one of the groups I was in 
had a car wash to raise money. Most people were 
cool but there was one guy in a white Chevy van 
that seemed to want a $100 detail job for his $5 
donation.
