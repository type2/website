Subject: Re: [VB] chicago area vw shops

Steve,

Try contacting the Northeast Illinois VW Association (NIVA).  There are
several members who've been involved for many years and may have some
Chicago area leads.  They also have a couple of shows each year (along
with Rockford's Stateline Volks Folks who have a show August 24 or 25 in
Freeport) that might help you make some contacts.

n_i_v_a_at_yahoo_dot_com is the club address, or try ahrens_at_ameritech_dot_net for
Tina Ehrens, the newsletter editor.  I don't think they have a web page.

I think I'm the farthest west of all the NIVA people, out on the Rock
River near Byron.  I remember an old VW place near Dundee I drove by a
few years ago.  They had a bubble window double cab on the lot.  Haven't
been back that way for a while.

You may not find much, but 80 miles can be better than 800 miles if you
find a place that can do the work.

Good luck.

-Jim Bryant
