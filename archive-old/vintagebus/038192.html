&lt;&lt; Any one know where to get a really good seal? Or is this something that 
needs
 to be salvaged from a junkyard. currently i have 3/4 of my original in pretty
 good shape, the last 1/4 is missing. &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
We bought six from the Bus Depot which while not being totally stock were 
much better than the four piece rubber hose type.  These were made of a 
closed cell foam like the 1964 on rear hatch seal.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS What ever you do get something in there to replace that missing seal piec 
of yours now!  EEE&amp;B
