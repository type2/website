Subject: New Tire Chains; Why I own a Type 2

Made a final trip of the year to COSTCO Sunday afternoon.

In the automotive/TBA section they've just added a new line of tire chains.
These are real chains - not cables - in a diamond-pattern configuration.
They use a semi-rigid hoop on the inside of the wheel, and a pair of
opposing connectors on the outside of the wheel.  No need to jack up or move
the vehicle to install them.  The kicker is that they are very low profile
and conform to the &quot;S&quot; standard for limited tire/body clearance.

They appear to be well made, and the kit includes repair links, a roll of
wire, a pair of rubber tensioners, a pair of waterproof gloves, a
combination waterproof sheet/installation instructions, and a plastic case.
They have a model that fits 185R14 tires, and the price in Tacoma is $39.95.

As I was leaving COSTCO a couple was trying to load a chest of drawers into
their enormous &quot;Luxury SUV&quot;.  They finally gave up and decided to lash it to
the [&quot;Luxury&quot;] roof rack, all the while striving to protect the furniture
from the rain and wind using plastic trash bags.

[Obligatory VW transporter/bus content]  That piece of furniture would have
fit inside my bus with ease, entering through either the side door or the
rear hatch.

And for what it's worth, at the COSTCO gas pumps today unleaded regular fuel
was going for $1.42.9/gallon.  Eat your heart out, ARCO :)

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
