Subject: RE: [VB] Shift-knob-extender-thingy

Vintage Parts carries a beautiful shifter extension with a patterned shift
knob to boot, I had these in stock but quickly sold out, give Shawn a call.

Howdy List,

I'm looking for one of those &quot;crooked&quot;
shifter-extender-thingys. All I've been able to find
are the straight ones. I'm sure I've seen the crooked
ones advertised before but can't seem to find were it
was. I guess I'm having pre-mature senior moments!!

Thanks,
3DPete
