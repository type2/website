Subject: Re: [VB] Re: VIN Woes

On my bus (67) the streeing box is very worn. It has been for awile, many
mechanics have told me so. What I want to know is how tough of a job is
this? I'm a novice mechanic. Have replaced an engine, redone my brake
system, rewired some things, ect,ect. So should I tackle this myself, or
take to a real mechanic?

&quot;Your Majesty, please... I don't like to complain,
But down here below, we are feeling great pain.
I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,
But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights
