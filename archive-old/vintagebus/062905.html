Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Slash rear bumper

Only on repo bug bumpers have the grommets. I have over 30 (bus)bumpers and
none of them have grommets (not for sale)

I meant; can you exchange original parts with the
repro ones and have a good fit? My bumpers are ok
originals but I have seen plenty bumpers with the
black inserts around the uprights and wondered what it
was there for. I always found it pretty ugly.
