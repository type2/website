Hi Paul,
First clean every connection from the battery forward and all grounds.  Since 
you have installed a new wiring harness most of this should have happened 
already.  Then get a volt/ohmmeter and check the voltage the battery and at 
each point the wiring connects to somthing else going from the battery 
forward.  We have found all too often either the dimmer switch dropping as 
much as two volts off or the light switch needs to be dissassembled and all 
parts in there cleaned and soldered together to prevent voltage drop and a 
hot switch!  Plus get rid of any starter solinoid relay it is a crutch and 
just creates more connections to go bad.  Right now we are running a 1963 SC 
truck with 6 volts with 55/60 Watt H4 bulbs.  Before doing all the above the 
headlights were dim and the head light switch got almost too hot to touch 
long.  Now the head lights are BRIGHT and white, and the switch does not even 
get warm.   Eric&amp;Barb
