Subject: Crank out Windows
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have crank out windows on my '65.  They are hinged on the top, and I believe they are manufactured by Hehr. They have this written on them:
HEHR:l-2186

The PO told me the company was still around, and that they were located somewhere in Norhtern California I think. He had replaced two of the cranks.  I am trying to find the gaskets for these windows.
Any ideas where I might find these?
