&gt; Did anyone happen to notice that nice silver single cab from Nevada at the
phx bug-o-rama?
&gt;
Oh, the Single Cab for what was it for sale for?  $16,000?!?  It was sweet
but not thaaat sweet.

&gt;I was standin there lookin at it when the judges walked up.....These are
supposed to be pay-for-hire judges im assuming by all the matching T-shirts
(guess they quit the ppls choice). Well anyway, one of them asked the other
about the chrome safaris the guy had installed......... guy#1 &quot;Are these
original?&quot; guy#2 &quot;No, these are reproductions...........But single cabs came
stock with them so we gotta give him points for that.....&quot;
WTF I thought these guys were supposed to be know-it-all vintage nazis if
theyre gonna judge on stock and purity!
&gt;
From what I've heard and seen, it's all friends of friends of the show
promoters doing the judging, sometimes volunteers.  You get the good with
the bad, I guess.
