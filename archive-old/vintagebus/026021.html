&gt;&gt;Not to fear!  You can get an interim dose of Bus _at_ http://www.vintagebus_dot_com....although you *will* miss the classifieds (gotta do something to that end...)
&gt;&gt;
To clarify, everything works except the programs - classifieds, gallery, postcards, etc.  so you can still waste your Friday away looking at pictures, show reports, etc..

Thom with a classifieds, nah, you could do so much more with the registry - sorting, &quot;gimme all the Buses with M-code xxx&quot;, I could go on, I've been waiting...  

I'm going out to SoCal this weekend, anybody need anything brought back to AZ?  You can bring it to my in-laws house on Sunday am, just email me.
