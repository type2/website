HUGE difference between spewing racism on this list and a note of history because he was involved with the beginnings of VW!

&gt; JB specializes (specialized?) in the Southwind heaters, whereas Mirvis'
&gt; specialty is the Eberspachers.  (Incidentally, Mirvis was booted off of
the
&gt; Type 2 list after posting a long pro-Nazi, anti-minority diatribe to the
&gt; list.  Whether this affects your desire to do business with him is of
course
&gt; a matter of individual choice. Myself, I'd freeze first...)

I thought I remembered some sort of flap about Mirvis. So pro-Nazi,
anti-minority stuff is banned from the list, hunh? I'll remember that. So, I
guess I better not mention that Hitler basicly commissioned the VW then :-0
