I call that cabinet the Headbanger, and may have been seen to put Ozzy and 
Metallica stickers on it.     Tall people may have problems with them in the 
am if they jump up when waking up.    A PO may have ejected it for this 
reason.   SOme early bays have a mesh hammock thing to stuff things in 
instead of the headbanger cabinet.

 The SO-42 would have had that cabinet as part of the package.
 I have looked at the later, post '67 Westy camper kits and that same
 cabinet is included in it too.  It looks very much the same with only some
 subtle changes.  Those are more common out here in Seattle, and cheaper
 too.  Just an idea to mull around...
