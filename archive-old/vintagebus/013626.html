BE careful packing those bearings! The last time I was working on my
brakes(around the middle of august)just doing an adjustment, for some reason
that i can not remember now i had to repack my front driver side bearing. I
put it back together too tight. Then a couple days later I began my trek from
Boston to Houston. After about 1200 miles that wheel locked up on me while
going about 50-60mph, it then freed itself then locked up then freed itslef,
until i limped to a rest stop a couple hundred yards away.

When I finally pulled the wheel, the outer bearing had completely shredded
itself and the coreof it had melted to the axle. It took a long time(in the
parking lot of an auto parts store/in about 95 or 100 degree heat) with the
help of a somewhat knowledgeable guy to break the old bearing off with a cold
chisel, i had to break it into 3 or four parts to get it off.

so my recc. to you is CHECK THE BEARINGS and make sure they are not to tight.
