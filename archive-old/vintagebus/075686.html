Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors? (fwd)

POR Sticks best to roughed up metal, lightly rusted metal, or preferably,
to bared metal that has been properly treated with the blue phosphating
solution sold by POR or a good body shop supply house. The solution is
kept on the bared metal for a half hour then rinsed with water til clean.
Then air dried, and then POR'd.

&gt; I know this may be a rookie question, but would you apply POR-15 over a
&gt; painted surface after having removed the majority of the rust?
