The June/July &quot;Wolfsburg Edition&quot; newsletter of the Northeast
Illinois Volkswagen Assocation has the following ad (again, so I
assume it hasn't sold):

Fors Sale: 1958 Double door Panel Bus. Vary rare.  Restorable.
Extra parts. $2000 or best offcer.  Call Mark (630) 325-4883.
(Stored in Elmhurst, Illinois)

I saw the vehicle last fall.  Chassis # 333.592, about January
1958.  It's pretty solid, under-pans not rusted through, jack
points intact.  Engine is sitting in cargo bay.  Not sure when it
last ran, but it's all there.  Extra parts are few, with some Bug
parts thrown in.  Maybe an extra &quot;bastard&quot; case, if I remember
correctly.

Owner is a VW person, looking for a good home for the bus.
