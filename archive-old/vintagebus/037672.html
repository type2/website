If you are really in need of the drag racing power of the bigger engine than a
1641cc and especially larger than 1776cc.  Then you would do far better off by
going the type 4 engine route converted  it into a upright engine.  The type 4
engines lasts easily 200,000 miles in the post-1967 buses that wiegh over
800Lbs. more than our 1955-67 buses.  The type 1 engine case is softer
aluminuim/magnesium alloy and by the time you bore and clearance the case it
is even weaker.  Which makes the case flex and crack, especially in the bus
that is heavier than the bug and KG.  Plus the bus is far less aerodynamic and
all that cargo room is so tempting to fill on occasion. 

-  -- -  -
as a matter of fact, a bus has better aerodynamics than a bug,  really.     it
just weighs more and as you say, so easy to fill it with really important
vital stuff you need to drive everywhere.

.    .. . .  .. 
 We will not even talk
about how much stuff can be strapped to a roof rack.  Also do you really need
that more power?  Are you going for the quickest quarter mile or faster top
speed?  If the latter then you should get the modified tranny that will
increse your speed at the same engine RPMs.  While staying with a 1600cc or
maybe a 1641cc engine.  This is the way we have gone with our 1960 panel
camper and it is great.  The only reason we are talking about going to the 2
liter type IV is that we want to get a tow dolly with it's own set of brakes
to tow buses home to save them.  Otherwise we would probably stay with the
type I, 1641cc.    Eric &amp; Barb
