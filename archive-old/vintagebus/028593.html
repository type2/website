And I think they did the 912 until 1969, so a &quot;late porsche engine&quot; could be either.

Hmm.  About about an early S engine?  Or a T with E cams?  With sextuple (sp)
webbers?  Or an early MFI engine (my personal favorite)

&gt; Thom, they built 356's till 1965, but also started Porsche 911 production in
&gt; 1964. The 3 piece case should have given it away to you. Did anybody ever
&gt; see the extended roof BD (I guess this bus is a custom, but because it's a
&gt; BD it must be cool, or just another hack), it has an early 356 A Porsche
&gt; engine in it.
