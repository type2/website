Subject: belt twisting &amp; coming off

We are still in Cottonwood, just outside Jerome.  We are having a
problem with the belt twisting inside out when we reach high RPM (3500 -
4000).

Situation:
  generator pulley is from a 6 volt type 3
  Crankshaft pulley is new brazilian
  belt is 15350  (15/32 width - 35.0&quot; long)
pulleys are slightly offset ~ 1/4 &quot;

it ran fine for nearly 500 miles getting here, warm weather etc.  Then
in the last 3 days the belt came off/twisted 4 times.  First time we
tried tightening it up (removed shim) but it came off in less than a
mile so we replaced the shim and it lasted about 50 miles.  We checked
the belt and had found that it had rotated so we tried to re-align the
pulleys better and reinstalled the belt.   This time the belt had
seperated so we tried a new belt - same size and a 13345 (10 mm
equivalent width).  As we reved up the engine to the 3500 to 4000 rpm
the belt would begin to twist, usually starting around the crank
pulley.  We have adjusted the belt each time to the 13 mm deflection.
Right now we are back tot the original configuration we drove out with
and it seems to be just fine.

Any idea to the cause?  We had help from a local Camp Verde VW guy, Dana
Leftkowitz, who is opening up a VW shop next week.  He has parts and is
able to bring by a bus after market (not power) pulley and a regular
generator pulley.  Will this help?  Our concern with going back to stock
is that we will be back to the 1.6 pulley ratio versus the 2.2 that we
have now and it will affect the cooling capability.

TIA
