Subject: Friday Topic: Women in busses linked to insanity

Well folks its Friday, and time for our favorite game &quot;Fun with Flaming&quot;!!
So let it begin!

There are some of us out here in St. Louis, and various members of the &quot;Bus
Butts&quot; club that whole-heartedly believe in the theory that any AVAILABLE
woman who drives a Vw bus is clinically insane.

This theory has been arrived at over many years of personal case studies
conducted across the country.   There are conditions however, to the
insanity rule:
1) The woman must be AVAILABLE and own a bus
2) If the woman was not into busses, but became an enthusiast AFTER hookin'
up with a man into VW's, she WILL NOT be insane.
3) If the afore-mentioned woman should for some reason leave that particular
man and once again become available, she then BECOMES INSANE
4) If she get back with another man, she does not become sane again, ONCE
INSANE, ALWAYS INSANE.

This rule does not necessarily hold true to other types of VW's however.
Type 1,3, or God forbid T4 owners are usually OK, but are considered
high-risk candidates for developing later issues.

Now, by insanity I don't mean stab you in the shower psycho stuff here, just
very subtle quirks and issues with the world that leaves a fella freaked and
generally miffed at the world in general.

Any other guys out there agree/disagree?

What about the gals eh? Clara? Feel free with the opinions/flames, just
PLEASE don't do anything that would make my mail administrator want to slash
my tires!  (Those Coopers are pretty $$$).

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
