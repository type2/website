&gt; how far is it to LA for you- and you are talking in a bout a week or two?
&gt; hm-  You need to check the brakes, change the oil, and gas (old gas makes
&gt; your engine run really hot, if not do wierder things like make the valves
&gt; stick), and battery, make sure all the wiring works.  Tape the windsheilds in
&gt; place?   cant you get seals?   and put that side window etc in place.  Then
&gt; you get to wonder will the motor be happy suddenly taking a __________ mile
&gt; drive in the hot weather.   I like to drive a round town a few hundred miles
&gt; to work it out and warm it up sort of before taking a trip.   Is this a motor
&gt; you used to drive on?   Nah, dont think you'ld get much sleep.

Chris,

Since I'm in the middle of your trip between Torrance and Anaheim, you could use
my place as a destination, stop and check, gather up me to follow you down, etc.

You could stop at the house, check things and if they are not good, pile into the
double cab and continue on down.  Depending upon where in torrance you are, that's
only a 12 mile drive.

Having said that, the BIGGEST sorrows come from rushing an old bus out of its
slumber and having it try and giddiup on down the road with the modern beasts of
war.

Scott
