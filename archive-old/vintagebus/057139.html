Subject: FS  59' Factory &quot; Transporter Workshop Manual&quot;

I have the listed manual for sale.  It is in very good
condition with no rips or tears, in the original blue
binder. The pages are in excellent condition.  The
manual has been used, but well taken care of. 
According to later editions, this manual covers all
transporter models from March 59' to November 62'.

Asking $70 + shipping.

P-mail me if your interested, first come first serve.
Thanks
Matt

I though I would give list members first dibs before
listing on thesamba_dot_com.
