Subject: Re: [VB] Questions.

are they leaking? If so, they are bad

best to pull the drums off and pry back the dust covers.  It should be dry under the dust covers.

neevr heard of the hinge pin coming loose.   Maybe drill a hole through the end of the pin and use a cotter key.  Or see if something is bent.

&gt; I've got a couple questions.  First, how do I know if my wheel cylinders are
&gt; bad or not?  I'm having to replace my master cylinder, and am not sure
&gt; whether to replace the wheel cylinders while I'm at it or not.  Second, the
&gt; hinge pin on my gas pedal keeps coming out of the hinge, 
&gt; how is the pin
&gt; supposed to be secured in?  Thanks.
