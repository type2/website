I just complelted a brake job on my 66 new shoes, turned drums, wheel
cylinder's and hose's. Cost me about 200.00 for everything. It stops on a
dime. I think that it is still cheaper than doing a Disk Brake convert. Add
it up and let me know i would be
interested.

my ex boyfriend has a lowered fat motor bus w/ 4 wheel disc brakes.   He was
always amazed at how well the stock drum brakes worked in my 65.
Maintenance I said, new hoses and all I put in it, adjusted right, cause when
I got the bus it had been sitting and was all rusted bad parts.  Well, the
point is in slamm  the brakes down hard situations discs were faster, but in
usual driving they were the same.

my 2 cents
