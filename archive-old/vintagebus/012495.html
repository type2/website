Recently I purchased a deluxe gasket set from WCM for a 67 Micro. The front
door set that glues to the body consists of 3 different types of
gaskets,two different lengths with a channel in it, one short one with a
kind of bull nose on one side, and a long one similar to the cargo door
set. My problem..........which ones  go where,and which way do they
face?The old gaskets were completly stripped out when I got the bus, and my
memory is not what it used to be. Thanks Jim.
