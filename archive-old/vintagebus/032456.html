The DMV will DEMAND some kind of proof that these plates belong to this 
vehicle.

The only other option is if the car is not yet registed, and is not 
&quot;on the books&quot; then to fib and tell DMV those are the plates that came with 
the
car, and you don't have the title.  If you're going to do this, then
have the bill of sale written either with the plates you wish to use, or
with just the VIN (which is sufficient in itself) - yeah, this is a bit
off the straight and narrow, but sometimes the straightest path is through
the mud.
