Subject: Re: [VB] leaky tranny

ya- the seam forward of the forward drain plug would be case to nose cone 
seam.  If it leaks from there it is a real pain to seal up- you have to pulll 
the trannny.

Is it dropping serious pudddles?   I would bring your 17mmm alllen 
wrench/socket coverallls and GL-4 and the oil pump with you on the trip, and 
check it every so often (day?) to top it up if necccesssary.   Trannnies are 
very sturdy but they do not forgive gettting low on oil- the main bearings 
give up.   But if it is a smalll drip you can do it.

To drain/filll the RGBoxes, I take the rear wheeels off.

Probably Mr. Lube put GL-5 in because that is what they carrried.

&gt; &gt; is coming from.

&gt;  &gt; how much does it leak?   I once had a bus with a tranny I kept topping 
up,
&gt;  &gt; but the tranny ended up dying.
&gt;  Well... I did the simple green thing before I fixed it, so I just now went
&gt;  out and poked around a little closer to see what was going on.  The area
&gt;  around the plate looks dry and clean still.  It looks like the leak is
&gt;  coming from around the side cover on the transmission (the part the axle
&gt;  flange bolts on to).  Also it is definitely leaking from the seam just 
ahead
&gt;  of the front drain plug, I'm guessing this is what is called the nosecone?
&gt;  
&gt;  The other part of the equation here is that Mr. Lube put GL-5 oil into the
&gt;  tranny.  They claimed they did it because it's thicker and would leak out
&gt;  slower.  So maybe now that I have thinner oil in there it's coming out
&gt;  faster.  I also jacked up the left side of the bus a little when I filled
&gt;  the tranny so I could get more oil into it.  I haven't been able to get the
&gt;  plugs out of the reduction boxes at all so I wanted to get as much oil into
&gt;  the centre section as possible. All this might have accelerated the 
leaking,
&gt;  it looks pretty bad right now.
&gt;  Hopefully it'll make it to Nevada and back.
