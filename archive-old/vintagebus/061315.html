&gt; ps. Be prepared to get the finger a lot from people with your new
&gt; headlights. I have those in my DD (4 years now) and when in a caravan I am
&gt; made to drive lead because my lights blind those that would be ahead of me.

Now that's odd.  H4s should have a much more controlled low beam than
sealed beam lights, with a sharp cutoff for the low beam to the left
side.

When correctly aimed they actually appear much dimmer to oncoming traffic
than the conventional setup.  I've never had anyone get annoyed at my
Marchal or Bosch H4s.

OTOH, if the quality of the Indian lenses and reflector matches the
quality of their metalwork there might be a problem!
