Subject: Re: [VB] more maintenance-heat improvement

Something I did yesterday that made a huge difference in my heat output was
wrapping insulation on the 3rd section of pipe under the bus (behind the
splash pan) that is not insulated from the factory. I also lined the
splashpan with insulation. I was getting plenty of air before, but now I'm
getting plenty of 'hot' air now!
