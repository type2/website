Subject: Re: [VB] SW gas heater help UPDATE..

Check your micros switch of the flame detector with a test light     If it
doesn't glow on both terminals  than defective.  If one or the other than
switch needs adjustment.  Adjustment should be at room temperature!

Rob
 &gt; the side of the blower seems to function correctly
&gt; (when it gets real hot, the white plastic thingy turns
&gt; and shuts off the gas) HOWEVER after it does this a
&gt; couple of times, the gas will not come back on or
&gt; comes on in a very limited quantity (even though the
&gt; plastic thingy on the thermal switch has rotated back
&gt; to the correct position), so the heater begins to cool
&gt; off and the air never realy heats back up as it
&gt; should.
