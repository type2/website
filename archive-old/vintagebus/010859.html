is the vintage meet and some drag-race type show in bremerton(?) listed on 
saturday.  this seems unusual to have 2 shows in the same area on the same 
day. then sunday the other drag-race type show at SIR. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jon,
Your info is correct!  We guess that Bremerton show folks decided it would 
help them to have thier drag racing show the day before SIR and that would 
entice VW racers that are coming from far away to SIR to race at the 
Bremerton raceway.  We did inquire about the date of the Bremerton VW show 
and were told that was the only date open for them at the raceway.  In the 
past we have tried to support the Bemerton event by swapping there and have 
been dissappointed in the size of this meet, organization, and even the size 
of the swap spaces.  If drag racing is your thing it might be worth going to, 
otherwise....   Eric&amp;Barb
