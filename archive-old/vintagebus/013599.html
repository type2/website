Here is the final cost of not only a tranny rebuild but rebuilt redux boxes
and an axle tube replacement with solid axle boots and it's all assembled
and strapped to a pallet.  USF Dugan is charging me $229.00 for truck
freight from CA to MO, ouch!  The final bill from Transaxle Engineering was
$773.29 ( original estimate was 860.00) and I would like to take this time
to thank my mom and her Visa for helping  her 36 year old son with his bus
hobby.  This will be a cinch to install and I'll let you all know how it
runs.  The rebuilder says that Gl-5 was fine and dandy to use so I will, so
there, I've said it. 
Jim
