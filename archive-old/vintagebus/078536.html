&gt;How did they prove the tires are under inflated after they've failed?  And
&gt;what pressure were they concidering as &quot;underinflated&quot;?  Need more info.

well, lawyers have ways!
seriously tho, tire forensics experts concluded the damage to the 
carcasses were in keeping with underinflation stress.

1) ford got complaints the explorers rode too much 'like a truck' and 
dropped the dealer recc'd tire psi to give that boat-like ride 
americans love so well.
2) bridgestone/firestone had problems at their plants that resulted 
in some tires being more susceptible to internal stress damage.
3) drivers running 6000lb vehicles at 75 mph+ on now-underinflated 
tires caused severe internal heating damage to the tires.
4) tires shredded; bad ford design (known since 80s) contributed to 
driver over-corrections to roll car.
5) ford betrayed an 80-year family relationship with the tire 
manufacturer by getting to the news media first and blaming it all on 
the tires. first impressions counted, tires took the rap.
6) US gov mandates new cars come with a device to warn driver of tire 
UNDER inflation, NOT overinflation.
7) ford quietly redesigns many suv model rears ... for unrelated 
reasons, of course.

i lived in texas while all this was going on, we had many of these 
lawsuits; i was researching tire pressures at the time (search the 
archive for my posts), and actually talked to firestone engineers 
about it. they were VERY skittish, i think they only talked  to me 
cuz my uncle ran their indy 500 team in the 70s... they were VERY 
sure to stress not underinflating the damn things.
