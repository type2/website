&gt;billy, it's not exactly clear in your post.

Sorry all.

&gt;Are you saying you can manually change gears w/ the &gt;nosecone attached with no problems.

Yes.

&gt;You should be able to do the twist/pull/push thing &gt;and get all gears and 1 reverse. is this correct?

Yes. It is a little hard to tell about the 1/2 since it's right in the middle of the R &amp; 3/4.

&gt;or are you saying you can get all the individual &gt;sliders to move fwd/rear

Yes, I can do that too, obviously, since I can do the first two.

Thing is, it becomes unbearable trying to get the shift rod to do it. Feels like there isn't the leverage needed.

Maybe I'm on crack.

Billy
