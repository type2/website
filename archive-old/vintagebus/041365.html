Hello List-

Sometime between 10:30pm tues. and 8:00 this morning someone stole my '66  
kombi from N. 41st and Stone Way in Seattle.  I am hoping Seattle-area
listmembers can keep an eye out for it.  The bus is pearl white, has some
old damage in the nose, is missing the rear bumper and has a beetle
exhaust.  It also has one of those crank-up roof vents you would find on
an R.V. In other words, it is a p.o.s., but it is my p.o.s. and I want
it back!  The lic. # is 862CDM.

Thanks,
Tristan Shaffer
