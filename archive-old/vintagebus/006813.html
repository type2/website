Subject: RE: [VB] Will `59 doors fit on a `62????

I must have missed something, I have had a 59 bus with 62 and later indent
for the handle doors on it and switched the correct doors without any latch
problems, I have had an early 64 combi in my storage yard with 60 doors and
they latch and line up properly, I original fit a 62 front door on my 60 DD
without a problem and it latched and lined up perfect but I was lucky to
find a 60's door to put on before paint, so I don't see where the latch
problems would be unless you tried to change the internal (door) latch
because they are different. So in my experience most doors are
interchangable if the original latch is still in the door.(except a mid 64
and later)

Hi Steve,
Pretty sure he is talking about the front doors not the cargo doors.  Since 
the cargo door hindges would be way off.  Eric&amp;Barb
