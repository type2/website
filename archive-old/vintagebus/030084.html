$140 per quart for Pearl White?  Ouch, babe!  My local auto body supply
store mixed me up a batch of Pearl White using DuPont Centari acrylic
enamel, and it only cost $29 per quart (plus reducer).  I used it to do
the bed of my DC this summer and it was a perfect match for the original
paint.

&gt; If anyone else has recently got some Glasurit pearl white, how does this code
&gt; compare?  I am using 22 line for the more antique/original look that
&gt; base/clear coat just doesn't have.  The code may be different in other lines.
&gt;  Glasurit's base/clear line is 55.  There is also a 90 low-VOC.
&gt; 
&gt; What Glasurit lines are others using?
&gt; 
&gt; Man, is this paint EXPENSIVE!  A quart of color with enough reducer and
&gt; hardener cost me $140.  ouch.  Looks pretty nasty from the MSDS too,
&gt; isocyanate and everything.  22 line is billed as urethane acrylic.
