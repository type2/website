&gt;  I imagine that removing corrosion from Al and

Hey, Tom Good, that's me:).  Sorry, I was sleeping through class.  I gave up 
on physics, besides this is chemistry, which I did a little better in, but 
still not a major (that was architecture).  Just a correction, the anode is 
the sacrificial bit and the cathode it the protected bit.  Corrosion on Al 
and Mg would be pretty light (i.e. thin layer) yes?  Anyway, just off the top 
of my head with no research, I would start with using the SAME metal for the 
anode as the cathode.  The electro-chemical action is being driven by the 
electrons you are pumping into the cathode not by the difference in the 
electromotive series.  Yes, it is a very simple process.  My experience with 
electrolysis has two drawbacks: 1) the anode has to be in line-of-sight to 
cathode surface you want to remove corrosion from.  This makes the insides of 
parts (such as door panels) difficult or impossible to treat.  2) 
electrolysis will leave magnetite (Fe3O4) on some of the heavily rusted 
areas.  Magnetite is the black stuff that the rust turns into, was already 
there and is exposed, or comes from a chemical reaction with the electrolyte. 
 Magnetite will supposedly not corrode any further, but it is loose and 
flaky.  I have found that I need to wire brush the magneite off.  Me thinks, 
If I have to wire brush it, why not just sandblast it to begin with?  So that 
is what I do.  More information on magnetite later in December.

Then Thom Wrote: 
&gt;  The rust stains on the dash can be wiped up with 
&gt;  CLR, which is available at the hardware store, and is a mild phosphoric 
&gt;  acid solution.
Actually CLR has no phosphoric acid according to the manufacturer's MSDS.  It 
contains Hydoxyacetic Acid (CAS 79-14-1) in 12-14%, Sulfamic Acid (CAS 
5329-14-6) in 3-5% and Citric Acid (CAS 77-92-9) in 3-5%.  From my 
experience, these do well to remove rust just like the phosphoric acid.

Still working on the chemical treatments for rust report,
