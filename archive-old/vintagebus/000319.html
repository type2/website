 Is there a difference between a regular rear bumper
 and a truck bumper?  I just ran across an add asking
 for a &quot;TRUCK&quot; bumper for a double cab.  
  &gt;&gt;
yes- for the 58 and earlier- stamped - bumpers there is a specific truck 
version,


and yes for 59 and half of 60- though I have never seen one,

from mid 60 on it was the same bumper as on a non truck type 2
