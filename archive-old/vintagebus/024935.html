&lt;&lt; well cleaning with gas kinda goes hand in hand with engine removal and gas
 tank cleaning,sure you have to be careful but you can set the bucket outside 
for a few days and all you have left is sludge that you can take to a 
disposal center in a jug ,  &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Which causes more air pollution.  If one uses kerosene all you have to do is 
drain the remains into a sealed container and let it sit long enough to 
settle out the dirt and reuse it for cleaning later!  Which will cause far 
less pullution by reusing the kerosene.  Gasoline is so flammable that just 
dropping a metal part against another metal part or sliding the container 
across cement is likely to light it up!  In dry climates you can light it up 
just by static electricity from walking across a room!  Kerosene is 
flammable, but to a far far lesser degree.   Eric&amp;Barb
