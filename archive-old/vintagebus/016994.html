The reason the sign is stated that way is for LARGE trucks.  This means 
tractor trailers.  If you are on a downgrade in a semi and you only use your 
brakes, the brakes will heat up REALLY quick (like less than 30secs) and you 
will lose all braking power.  The diesel engine in a tractor trailer has 
engine brakes.  The engine brakes use the compression of the engine to slow 
the truck down.  Buy using the engine brakes in a low gear and &quot;stab&quot; 
braking you can safely manuever down a steep downgrade.  (stab braking is 
slowing your vehicle 5mph below a safe speed, letting the truck gain speed 
to your safe operating speed, then applying the brakes again to lower the 
speed 5 mph)  The stab braking technique with the engine brakes will give 
the brake pads and rotors time to cool down between use.

If you are traveling down a mountain pass and see a semi in one of the run 
off ramps you can assume one of 2 things.  1.) The driver shifted the 
transmission while on a downgrade and could not get back into gear (Semi's 
have non-synchonized transmissions, once out of gear on a downgrade it is 
impossible to get back into gear) or 2.) the driver did not use engine 
brakes and a low gear and only relied on his service brakes.

Hope this helps :o)

P.s.  Just finished taking the D.O.T. testing for my CDL lic and am a 
service engineer for the Heavy truck industry!!!   They teach this method to 
all new truck drivers.


It was written:

I know that most municipalities that have steep hills, don't Have a CLUE
how to drive,,

I finally found a sign that says,,,, Steep Hill, Use YOUR Brakes

most of them say, Steep Hill, Trucks use LOW gear.
and *WE* know that is not good for engines,,  ;-)
