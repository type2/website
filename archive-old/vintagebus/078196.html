Subject: clutches smutches.

So, some will recall my mentioning the broken clutch cable the other day,
right?  And Clara remembers her reply, too..:)

Well, replaced the cable this weekend, it had indeed broken.  Seems it
broke right at the front of the bowden tube, as if it rubbed to
much...hmm.

Well, adjusted it to a ball-park, crawled out, and checked the play at the
pedal.  Pressed it once..twice...and snap.  The pedal was much easier to
press, and I hear the terrific sound of metal bits falling in the
bellhousing.

#$^$_at_#%^%%%$.  I bet the throwout arm broke.  (thanks clara!:p )   Just
what I wanted again. (for those that don't remember, I had one break years
ago on my '69...I had a friend's dad repair it at his machine shop. just
replaced the whole broken arm..)

So, who sells new throwout arms?  Any better then any others?  For a late
model, that is, '66.

I suppose I'll finally fix that leaky crack in the pressure sender boss,
if I can, while the engine is out. Anyone remember what NTP thread the oil
pressure sender uses?

..once the engine is out.

...david
