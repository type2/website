Subject: all of Fourty

Good morning to you, Jason and to your 'ol Lady, who's turning fourty....
Do tell me, if you will, what kind and make of a CDI unit you had found to fit
a 6 Volt splittie..I had just yesterday called at a battery manufacturer near
Vereeiniging who will supply me with a custombuilt , new 6 Volt battery....

I thought to add to that a CDI unit would be a nifty idea....

It is wintery freezing here in the Highveld of South Africa,  but this mail
comes with fond greetings to all your VW Bus folks.....
