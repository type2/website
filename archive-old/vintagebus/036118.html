I sold that bumper to him because he said he NEEDED it for HALF the price he 
is asking now!

Are you kidding!?????????
People like this driving our hobby off the charts.

 IMHO, &quot;ROS&quot; should only apply to an NOS piece that has been damaged in some
 way and then restored to it's previous NOS condition.  That ribbed bumper
 was not NOS before straightening and thus the term does not apply.  Actually
 the whole idea of ROS is ridiculous and I should probably be slapped for
 my above description... but I digress.
 
 I have been told that that bumper is not straight, perhaps the PO listee
 cares to comment?
