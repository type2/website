I'll be out in the Whittier, Southern California area from this Friday-on
without a VW.  Any listees nearby to Whittier, going to the OCTO meet, and
want to give me a ride to the OCTO meet?   You name the time and place
Sunday am and I'll be there.  Gotta keep my rep and arrive in a VW...  :)

Thanks,
