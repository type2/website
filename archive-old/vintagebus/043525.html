&gt;
&gt;List, two questions:
&gt;1. Do you think a removable cargo floor is possible?

Anything is possible, given enough time, money, and welding rod.  :)

&gt;2. If you do, any suggestions for materials?

Most of the things I can think of boil down to wood (or woodoid
substances) or steel.

One idea I have is computer-room flooring.  The stuff that's about
3/4&quot; thick and comes in 2' square panels that you lift up with that
two-suction-cup thing (which also breaks the ice at naughty parties.)
It might tend to rattle around in a Bus but then again, those sections
are HEAVY.  I have jumped up and down on them in a computer room, and
run loaded two-wheelers (hand trucks) over them, and they don't seem
to go anywhere.

&gt;Then I was thinking of having some sort of REMOVABLE cargo floor.
&gt;Envision this:  You lift up the cargo floor, perhaps in sections,
&gt;from the &quot;B&quot; beam back to the &quot;C&quot; beam.  [...]  Granted, it is not
&gt;the most wide open storage space with the control tubes going all
&gt;over the place like spaghetti.

You may wish to provide a little extra protection for really vital
things, like the accelerator cable (in a tube) and the brake line
(usually on the left frame rail).  On a Bus without belly pans
they are of course open to road debris, but I think having stuff
rolling around next to them all the time would be different.

With the steel, you might consider Dzus fasteners to hold it down.
Otherwise, bolts or screws in the &quot;valleys&quot; would probably work.
You could fasten them into threaded holes or captive nuts placed
in angle iron welded to the beams: 

__      ____      __
  \__T_/ __ \_T__/
    -|-+[  ]+-|-
       |[  ]|
        [__]

&gt;I also thought putting down wood, plywood, or fiberboard slates
&gt;and then gluing a rubber mat to them so it could also be &quot;rolled up&quot;.

I'd vote for some heavy exterior grade or even marine grade plywood
polyurethaned to hell and back.  Bolts would also work to hold this
down, but you'd have to countersink holes for them in the wood if
you didn't want bolt heads sticking up.  Socket head bolts might
work or look better in this application.

One thing that would be a little easier (IMHO) to do in wood instead of
steel would be to add some of those &quot;D ring in a metal pocket&quot; things.
The ring folds flush into the pocket when unused, but if you need
a hard point to secure a load, flip the ring up and run some rope
through it.

I know I keep talking about bolts and you want to roll it up, but
I really think that you will want it bolted down to prevent rattling.
That is, unless the floor material is heavy enough to prevent rattling
on its own.  Maybe some good magnets would work to hold a steel floor
down, yet be fairly easily releasable?  (Unless you regularly carry
loads of computer disks, etc.)

Another idea for a sectional floor would be to have a fixed strip
running down the middle and flaps on either side hinged to it, like
two pianos sitting back to back.  You could even recess the hinge
pin into the floor (use a router on the edges of the boards) so
the pivot wouldn't be sticking up.

Whatever you use for flooring, you might want to put some Dynamat,
fiberglass insulation, or plain old foam on the bottom side for
thermal and acoustical insulation.
