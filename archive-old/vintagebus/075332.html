Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

that sounds like a great idea. does the vapor barrier go between the body 
panel and the insulation? would por-15 eliminate the need for a vapor 
barrier? 

-matthew

&gt;&gt;Last fall I insulated behind all my panels with the pink fiberglass
&gt;insulation from Home Depot which made a HUGE difference in sound 
proofing,
&gt;as well as giving my doors a &quot;whump&quot; noise when they close from the 
original
&gt;&quot;clang&quot; noise they previously were.
&gt;
&gt; make sure you install a vapor barier (plastic
&gt;sheet) to keep condensation from rotting your bus away as the insulation 
can
&gt;cause this.
