hey list

So I had one of these ol' things kickin' around the basement - it's the type
that has a big base that hold naptha, aka white gas (I think), and that you
fill then hold upside down until a spot of gas forms then you light it and
shortly the flame goes out.  I would assume that there is some sort of wick
in there that draws the gas up to this thingy upon which the aforementioned
spot forms (whoa).  You put the thing out with this sort of lid that just
cuts off O2.  I also have one of those propane deals that screw on a lil'
propane cylinder.  I'm sure everyone and there grandmother knows the type of
which I speak.

Anyway, it was 30 below yesterday and I put em both on in my bus for a short
time to get every thing warmed up.  And it got me to a thinkin'.  I could
even use this naptha heater under my bus.  I could just fire it up, let the
flame go out and put it under the block to act as a block heater, (here
everybody, EVERYBODY, has a block heater in thier car,  you plug you car in
where ever you go - all of the parking lots have electrical outlets so
people can plug there car in at work etc.. - most people with a newish cars
have remote starts, sometimes they work by just clicking a remote control
and your car starts and warms up while you are inside, on other types when
the temp of the car gets below a certain point the car starts and warms up
automatically until it reaches a certain temp then it shuts off .) Anyway,
this naptha thing would likely work great under my bus on those cold days.
I can also just fire it up and leave in running while I'm out cross-country
skiing - I'll come back to a nice and warmish bus.  Those types that screw
on the propane bottle kinda scare me - they could easyily tip and, while
they don't have an open flame they sure would ignite anything flamable that
they came in contact with.  The naptha thing though would never tip,  and it
has this big metal grill over it so I can't see it igniting anything.  I
even drove with it while it was running today to go to the carwash to clean
a few pieces I picked earlier in the week (I found two very nice ol'
cabinets one just need cleaning and waxing and has nice original paint, the
other needs overpaint removed to reveal a very nice blue-green old paint
pokin' through, I also found a very neat pie-safe, those are things that
have doors made out of screen or sheet metal with holes poked in it, keeps
flies out and lets pies cool - 3 very nice pieces that I can sell at auction
for new tires yeee haa.)

Back to my point, so what do the folks think about those naptha fired
heaters?
