Subject: DBH Washer Top

List folk,

Just got a shipment of repair parts from Das Bulli Haus and along with
them came the repop washer bottle rubber top I ordered.  The bottle,
plastic ring and internal tubes were all that came with the bus.  The
repop rubber top is the correct diameter and shape, but seems to be
missing a cast in ridge that should be there so the ring can cinch down
against it and seal it to the bottle.  Right now it just falls out when
the bottle is inverted.

Does this sound correct?  I've not examined a original or NOS top, so
I'm not really sure what it should look like.  The closest pic I could
find of one was in Kimball's bus series (year 1967) in HVWS, but it only
showed the top installed on the bottle...not around the base of the
rubber part.  Am I missing a part off of the bottle?

Any expert care to enlighten thy brothern who just spent 17 quid on
yonder repo'd rubber part?   Anyone else know of another/better repo, or
have a line on NOS?

Thanks!

Steve Harris
