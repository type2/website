Someone has a custom box type hich mounted to the back of a white bus. I saw 
it at the red barn swap. It was similar to the original style with a 
upgraded function. I don't remember much about the bus, but the hitch made 
me think. If someone knows the bus owner, I would like a picture of it so 
that I can make one similar to it. I have all the fab pieces including the 
box hitch section I just need a better idea of how to put it all together.
