&gt; The generator light always goes off after starting,
&gt; but the battery has been going flat.

You can do an informal load test of the battery with
the equipment you have.  Check the electrolyte level
in each cell and top off with distilled water if
needed.  Then, charge up the battery all the way with
your plug-in charger.  &quot;All the way&quot; probably means
around 60 amp-hours, so if your charger says it puts
out 6 amps, charge for at least 10 hours; if it says 10
amps, charge for at least 6 hours;  15 amps 4 hours; etc.

Disconnect the charger and measure the battery voltage.
It will probably be well over 12.6 V.  Then, get in the
Bus and turn on everything electrical you can think of:
headlights, wipers, radio, dome light, etc - but don't
start the engine.  Go to the back and measure the battery
voltage again - it will be lower but it should still be
above 11 volts.  It shouldn't drop quickly but stay
relatively steady for several minutes.  If it's a lot
lower than this, I would vote for the battery being
discharged.

If it passes this test I would suspect the regulator.

If you want a possibly more accurate battery test, most
FLAPS will test your battery for free, with an eye to
selling you a new one.

Have you tried polarizing the generator?  This may not
help, but done correctly, it won't hurt anything.  Muir
has directions.  (Don't do this if you have an alternator.)

I second E&amp;B's advice to check all the battery cable
connections, regulator connections, etc.

I hope this helps!
