&gt; puzzle.  Does anyone find that after market vent wing
&gt; rubber does'nt fit perfectly to make a nice seal?  Or
&gt; is it my vent wing itself that's not allowing it to
&gt; fully close and seal itself against water.  My frames
&gt; are not rusted out.  Any experiences with these woes? 
A couple good friends of mine have tried to get these to fit and couldnt
get it to work.

One of them is meticulous and sat there for like 3 days trying to get them
to work and no dice.

What a friend of mine has recommended is to take the old seal off and use
black silicone to coat it front and back very thinly (kinda paint it with
the stuff... real thin &amp; rubbed in good!)  I have seen seals he did this
to and they look brand new and seal properly...

Worth a shot &amp; cheaper to boot!

take care,

Steve
