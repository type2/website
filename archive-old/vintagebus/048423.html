 So did this strike anyone else as odd. Hook up two batteries but keep it
stock...not to ad fuel to the fire of the stock vs modified threads (I
guess a little gas on a campfire never hurt). If you are going to go to the
hassle and extra weight of carrying another battery why not just convert. I
admit 6 volt can work, if all is in pristine working condition. The 12 volt
conversion is very undoable and much nicer from a reliability stand point.
I know it is being sensitive but please don't lecture keep it stock and
then say to hook up two batteries. This is written mostly tongue in cheek.
And in no way did the above statements piss me off. I couldn't run my
Alpine CD player with two amps and 6 speakers without my 12 volts. So there.
