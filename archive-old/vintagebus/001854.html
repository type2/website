Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Kombi...Clutch cable problem?

&gt;  Before I got my bus back on the road, I had to undue the wing nut that
&gt;  holds the clutch cable. I cleaned everything up so I could adjust by hand
&gt;  and then put it back on. Since then the play in the pedal has slowly got
&gt;  worse

I had a similar problem with my T3 when I bought it. I put 3 cables in it,
all bought from my FLAPS. Each one frayed (like Clara was describing)
immediately after I installed it. I finally got one from my VW dealer (yes,
NQ, I said VW dealer). This one has been working in since 1979.
