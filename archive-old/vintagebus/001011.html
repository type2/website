I updated my web site with a few picture for my 1960 microbus.

Mostly work were done in removing my passenger dogleg, and  cutting the
front passenger corner.  In the next week i will repair this area.

Also in the  other album u can see my westfalia 1973 laying in the snow as
17 feb 2001 was cold and windy, but this is non split related, the bay is
outside, the split is inside the garage hahaha

here it is:

I was thinking salvaging my dogleg but with the advice of kelly, they are
dead, so im on a run now to find better front wheel arch, both side.
