OK, I've got a really stupid point to ponder.  I know the answer (or at
least I think I do), but it still bugs me everytime I'm buiding an engine
and I watch that camshaft gear spin around only once for every 2 turns of
the crankshaft.

The point in question is:  Are the RPM of you engine measured by how many
times per minute your crankshaft turns 360 degrees (I assume this to be the
correct answer) OR how many times per minute your camshaft and distributor
turn 360 degrees.  They're not the same!

Think about it.  Since your tachometer runs off your distributor, wouldn't
that imply that 1 revolution of your distributor = 1 RPM?  If that were the
case, that would mean that at 3000 RPM your crank is really spinning at a
bearing-shreading 6000 RPM!

But we know that's not the case, right?  Surely your distributor sends 1
pulse each time it sends a spark to a wire.  That means that it only sends 2
pulses for each 360 degree revolution of your crank.  So somewhere in the
mystical electronic intricacies of your tachometer, it must be multiplying
these pulses by 2 in order to show the the RPM of the crank instead of the
distributor.

OK.  I warned you this was pointless.  I'm bored at work today, what can I
say.  And now that you've read it, that's 1 minute of your life you can
never get back!
