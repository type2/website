Subject: re: roof supports
Date: Sun, 2 Aug 1998 23:38:08 -0500

Well thanks to everyone who gave me advice re roof dent repairs - my plan
is to cut out the roof sections between the two supports, replace the two
supports, and weld in new steel for the roof - sounds easy (why am i so
worried then)

problem is from where do i get the new roof supports? does anyone have a
source for such a thing?

thanks in advance
