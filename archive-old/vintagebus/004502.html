&gt; I must acknowledge that the
&gt; &gt; parafin wax trick was taught to me and others by Bill May from the
&gt; vintagvw
&gt; &gt; list a few years ago.  I? :-) ....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; NQ
&gt;
&gt; I was having a very, very tough time getting off that bolts that hold my
&gt; shocks on.  I'm sure those shocks were original to my 60 standard.  I
tried
&gt; loosen-al, wd-40, heat etc.. and I had a huge bar on my socket and still
&gt; could not get those things to budge.  I recalled the NQ-Wax tip and
&gt; &quot;borrowed&quot; one of those silly candles that my wife has.  I just heated up
&gt; the bolt touched and rubbed the candel around the hot bolt and it came
right
&gt; off - I was amazed.  Although my wife was a bit p-off when she saw the
&gt; pieces of candle in the drive was.
&gt;
&gt; jdd 60 std
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to that VW-Guru - NQ.
