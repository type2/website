Subject: Lowering the Type II

I plan on lowering my bus that I have. I know of the lowering kit that is on
the market that does away with the reduction boxes, but can you lower it
just like a bug by turning the splines, and leave the reduction boxes? And
if so, how much can you lower it before the camber gets too ridiculous? I
still plan on hauling stuff in my bus, maybe even towing my oval, and I
don't plan on going on too many long road trips (just the occasional show).
So I thought it would be better to keep the reduction boxes.
Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually done it), that
you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to the right, and
vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber, or bumpsteer.
Has anyone done this themselves? I know many of you don't agree with
lowering a bus, but I think the lowered buses that I've been seeing in
HotVW's look really good.

Any technical help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance
