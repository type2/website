Subject: [VB] 15&quot; beauty ring TOOLING available
Message-ID: &lt;0.9b260e19.25603339_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Richard, who makes the round tool boxes, says he has the toolings to make 15&quot; 
beauty rings.  He cannot get the metal to make the beauty rings, so he wants 
to know if anyone wants/needs/desires/cherishes/desiderates*/whatever the 
toolings.  I believe you can see the results (but not the tool) at:

http://www.roundboxtools_dot_com/products.htm

Here is Richard's original message to me:

&gt; I had some tooling made to reproduce the beauty trim rings 
&gt; in 15 inch.  The samples are almose identical to the originals!! The 
factory 
&gt; cannot obtain 5052 grade aluminum which is necessary for the rings to hold 
&gt; themselves in the wheel, plain 100% alum is too soft.. Do you know anyone 
&gt; that either wants the tooling to make these or what do you think the market 
&gt; is for these things.
&gt;  Richard
