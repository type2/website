Hey Now!

    I just checked out the Bug Shop for the first time in a while.  John
sure has come a long way with this oval.  If you haven't seen his page
then shame on you.  It's wonderful!  So, it begs the question: are there
any splitty resto pages as good as this?  Of course Thom's and Everett's
are right off the top, also Kelly's(aka The metal wizard!), but any
others?  If you know of a sight that is keeping a *detailed* log with
photos of a resto I'd be happy to collect them all and post it to the
list.
