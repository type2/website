Subject: Re: [VB] No Power to Coil

make sure the wire is still connected at the fuse block. mine fell off
recently and it took a while to figure out why there was no spark.


&gt; [Original Message] 
&gt; I'm having some electrical issues. I think I got it figured out. There =
&gt; is no power getting to the coil, but there is power at the fuse (2nd one =
&gt; from right). I think it could be a broken wire. Anyone have an idea or =
&gt; is this too vauge?
