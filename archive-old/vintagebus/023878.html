Subject: Stewart- Warner Manual Online!!

First of all I need to apologize to the guy who sent me (&amp; others) this
manual at no cost. I have deleted the messages and I don't know your
name. If you speek up I will give you credit on the page.

I have scanned the manual and made it available from my VW page. Follow
the link in my sig and you should be able to find it.

Note: The scans are not real great. I had to use my &quot;alternate&quot; Scanner
at work becasue my good scanner is in storage for the summer.

If you find any missing links please let me know. I have a cold and my
head has been far from clear.

Anyway, it is there and gives some great information.
