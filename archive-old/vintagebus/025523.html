Subject: 63 small nut trans FS
Message-ID: &lt;376556BF.2407_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

I have a 63 small nut tranny drum to drum(including redux boxes), that
was _supposed_ to be good before it came out. This is third hand info to
me, so I wouldn't advise buying it and stuffing it without some
preliminary inspection. It is all there, including nosecone, and holds
gear oil.  Hell, I think it even has a starter and a throw-out bearing
on it.
I will not ship it, too much hassle. 
I will bring it to a close meet ( thats close to Corvallis, Oregon) or
you can pick it up. $100.
