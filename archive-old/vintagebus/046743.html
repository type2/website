&gt;  &gt; Just thinking...
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Has anyone ever made a gas tank? I was looking at the area for the
&gt;  &gt; gas tank for my '59 SC. As you know, you get to it from the storage
&gt;  &gt; area under the bed. When the gas tank is in place, there are some
&gt;  &gt; panels that keep you from seeing it. So I was thinking about making a
&gt;  &gt; gas tank to TOTALLY fill the area where it is supposed to be
&gt;  &gt; installed. Seems like I could get a pretty big more square tank in
&gt;  &gt; there that would hold more gas.
&gt;  
== =  =
the 59 SC I had a couple years ago had the 15 gallon bay window gas tank.   
It also had a 28 pict on a 40hp motor, low gearing little nut trans, and got 
about 28mpg.  I drove from San Jose to Oly, WA, and stopped once in Oregon 
for gas (about 850 miles trip)
