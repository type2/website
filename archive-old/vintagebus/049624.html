Subject: Re: [VB] Friday buses

&gt;It would be kewl to know what kind of buses and their conditions that we all
&gt;on the list have, so if you feel so inclined post what you got.
&gt;
&gt;I have;
1) 70 delta green benchseater with 72 front axle, red rear 71 hatch,
sliding door off a 72, lotsa rocker rot, no front bumper (rotted out dog
legs) and rattlecan paint on half of it...
sweeeeet runner.
2) 65 perlweiss singlecab with the nose completely off, no pass floor, rot
in the treasure chest. Born the same day as me, I'll fix this White Whale
if it kills both of us - on the same day, natch.
3) 67 hard-top deluxe, formerly turq/white, now black/vomit thanks to PO.
Smushy nose, winshield rot, cut rear wheel wells. Otherwise nice! Am
replacing all the brakes today.
Please buy it from me before I haveta put it on *bay and some clown from
Idaho or sumpin cuts up a good bus to make a shorty outta it!

70 Neunsitzer
65 Pritschenwagen
