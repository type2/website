Jack Maynard recommends avoiding counter weighted cranks that are
basically stock cranks with weights welded on.  I have had good luck
with the stock counter/weighted cranks.  It is important to have these
cranks dynamically balanced along with with the rest of your engine
parts.  These are not full circle cranks and typically do not require 
machining of the engine case.  I think that people will be extremely
happy with a balanced engine using the stock counterweighted cranks. 
They run smooth, quiet, cool and for a long, long time!  This is a
really smart choice over a stock crank.
