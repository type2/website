I'll get to my denim comments in a sec.

I used leftovers from cheapo ribbed floor mat
material I bought from a big box lunb/hard store.
I cut it to ft below the lip and it looked
really nice.  Made it two piece to clear the
steering column.  BTW, this material made a
good match to the original mat between the
front seats in a walkthru, and I used it
horizontally along the base on the seat backs.
It looked pretty good.

Denim is a great idea, and if you are able to 
pick and choose where you clip the material
outta the overalls, you could place the hammer
loop, pocket, hole for the suspender button,
whatever in a strategic position to enhance the 
denim effect, and provide an organizer for a
change, garage door controller, whatever.

All sorts of possibilities exist when one
extrapolates to the panels . . . . a rear view
of the overalls, with pockets strategically
located to hold the silverware for a camper,
a front view with the fly appropriately placed
to . . . uh . .  wait a minute . . . um . . .
let's not go there.

Busless, fortunately, so my overactive and now
unemployed mind can't get into any trouble by
actually doing anything like this.  Hmm . . .
I do have the panel below the rear seat from the
'67 deluxe still around . . . hmm
