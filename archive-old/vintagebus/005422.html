Hey Fred
that filter adaptor mounts under your oil cooler inside your fan shroud, the
arm for the filter is at a fixed angle and you have to cut the shroud to
screw on the filter.Its all one piece so you've got no choice as to
mounting. Thats three problems from my perspective, 1 only filter hot oil, 2
some blocking or altering of the air flow, 3 you've got to cut the tin, not
to mention the hell of a mess you've got changing a horizontal filter. I
dont know why people are scared of a full flow filter, lot easier to tap two
oil galleys than to tin snip a round hole, 'real' full flow cleaning, and
you can mount the filter vertical where you want it.As far a reliability
from leaks, use good hardware and its a non-issue. Think tranny coolers with
long hose runs, dry sump oil systems on motorcycles, none of those normally
have a problem
