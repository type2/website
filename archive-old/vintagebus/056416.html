Subject: Re: [VB] Busware truck canopys, pics posted / webbing colors

Just wanted to give credit where credit is due.  I got a new tilt canvas
from Tom for my Binz.  Had to be special made because the Binz bed is a
little shorter than a regular crew cab.  It looks fantastic!  The fit is
excellent.  I'm not sure about the minutia of correct stiching color I just
know it fits good and looks great.

&gt;  The og canvas and hoops that I borrowed from Paul Reeves to make what at
&gt; the time was going to be hoops and canvas for myself, were from his 65 DC.
&gt; The canvas had green salvage stiching, grey vinyl trim around the front
gate
&gt; latch hole &amp; window, and what looked like natural tan canvas straps.
&gt; However, when you looked at the back of the straps where they had been
&gt; shaded from the sun &amp; weather, the straps appeared to be dark green.  In
an
&gt; effort to be more correct, I matched that color on the straps.  I am glad
to
&gt; learn that earlier canvases had other colors.
&gt;
&gt; In any event, I can supply canvases w/ whatever color straps, etc. are
&gt; appropriate for the year specified.
