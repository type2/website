&gt;    One of the best Pomona's I ever had, why I don't know, could it have been

&gt;found a few other goodies. Pressed bumper city, if you needed one they were
&gt;there and at GOOD prices. A lot of nice buses for sale fair prices.

Man, and that's what you get for not being able to make it to every show or 
swap you want to.  I've been itching for a one wheel trailer for a while 
now (doesn't have to be Allstate) and all the ones I've seen around the net 
have easily topped the $300 mark!  Guess I just gotta keep my ear to the 
ground!
