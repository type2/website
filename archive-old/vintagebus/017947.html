Has anyone seen/experienced one of these, or at least the company?  It
sounds like a reasonably-feasible idea.  Of course, I'd have to pick
up a DC-DC converter, since I've got a 6-volt system, but that's a
minor detail (handling the doubled current draw might be interesting,
though).  I suspect you'd have the same problem as with heat in the
winter - nowhere near the capacity needed to handle the entire
interior volume, but quite enough to handle the front cab area.
