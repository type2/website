&gt; I know...touchy subject. Gonna ask anyway though.
&gt; I'm not doing 
&gt; anything right now, I'm just talkin'. So don't
&gt; bother with the &quot;don't 
&gt; do it's&quot; and such. Tune out if you don't want to
&gt; talk.
&gt; 
&gt; A buddy and me were hanging out and shooting the
&gt; sh*t. We got to 
&gt; talking about Double Door busses and how one would
&gt; go about doing a 
&gt; DD hack. 


And I bet you were knocking back a few huh..........
