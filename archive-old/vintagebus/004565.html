I find all this analyzation over the inlet air scoops fascinating.  It's
neat to read how much science can go into something so seemingly simple. I
for one have really enjoyed it.  One thing that I've always wondered about
is how air flowing over our dubs can actually cool our vehicles.  We're all
familiar with the atomization effect are we not?  Wouldn't the air flowing
by the air inlets on our bugs, buses, ghias, things, t3's, t4's, etc. tend
to suck air out instead of in?  It seems to me that there would be a vaccuum
created in the engine compartment in excess of what the fan already creates.

Scoops seem like a great idea (but granted - not for looks.)

Here's another idea.  Back when I had my 71 Westy, I had a heater system
hooked up with a squirrel cage fan to recirculate air.  It barely worked but
that's another story.  The fumes from the bad heater boxes caused me to just
disconnect the tubes that move heat into the bus.  Well as luck would have
it, we're going down the road (Mr.VW aka Jeremy Vreeman, his friend Steve,
and I) and we're getting some nasty ass fumes - worse than before.

What happened was there was a bottle of oil sitting on the squirrel cage fan
in the spare tire well.  The air rushing underneath the bus fed right into
the heater boxes, up to the fan, and into the bus.  The heat from this was
so intense, it melted the bottle of oil, dumped the entire contents down
into the ductwork, and damn near fumed us out (especially Steve since he was
sitting in the rear.)

So since there is definitely positive pressure down there in this area of
the bus, if someone wasn't running stock heater boxes, could a way be devise
to feed air into the engine from this area?

On 2nd thought, it probably wouldn't work - especially on 1600DP engines
because of the hot air from the oil cooler - oh well, even though I pretty
much just ruined my whole idea, I decided to send this anyway so you all
could enjoy reading about this fiasco.  :-)
