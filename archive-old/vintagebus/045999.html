 AFAIK type III coolers are the same as type 1 except for the oil pressure
 sender hole.  (hmmm, this might be a good place for a temp sensor?)
 
 Now, the type IV coolers are the same about the mounting surface and are
 wider.  You need to mod the tin to use them, but it might be worth it.
 ===========================
yes, I have this in my 61 (on the motor that had been in my 65 westy) and 
noticed a drop of 5-10*C on the fully warmed up temps after installing it.
............................
 &gt;There ARE 2 different types of type 3 coolers, I
 know because I have one on my bus. There is one that looks exactly the same
 as a type 1 except for the oil temp sender, BUT, there is also one that has
 over 30% more cooling fins, that is the one I use. There is a bus here in
 town with a NEW engine in it and he has recorded his temps at rpm's around
 town and traveling. He is going to install a type 3 we the 30% more fins and
 run it. This way we will know for sure if the extra fins make a difference.

results   come on, come on.
