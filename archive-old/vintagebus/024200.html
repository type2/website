I'm planning a journey in my 67 westy with my wife and our Weimeraner, Simon,
from minneapolis to Calgary then on to Vancouver , Seattle and back through
the US. If any one in those areas can provide names and numbers of good
service garages or emergency contatcs it would be greatly appreciated, I don't
anticipate any major problems as I just finished installing a new clutch as
well as general tuneup and inspection and had a good look at the engine while
it was out and all seems well. Still, it doesnt hurt to be prepared!

	We're really looking forward to our first big journey in our first bus! I got
it this spring and have only really taken it around Minnesota. I have a 56
single cab but have not taken it outside the city as it needs some work (still
in original but rusty condition). I did bring it 200 miles north to enter it
in Pelican Rapids' &quot;Ugliest Truck Contest&quot; but soundly lost to farm trucks
with massive leaks, missing floors and one with a tree that had taken root in
the bed! 

	Any recommendations or contributions for my home-made emergency and vw
contact list would be greatly appreciated. The vintagebus list has been
fantastic, great advice, great stories and a good sense of humor (finally
tracked down an NOS muffler bearing!)

							Thanks - Tim Gartman, Minneapolis
