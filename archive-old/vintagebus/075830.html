Subject: Re: Wiper arm length?

From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;12-15/32&quot; length.  The problem with going with longer amrs or blades is the 
&gt;arc then increases to the point that the upper blade tip then chew up the 
&gt;windshield rubber and even the paint on the body from swinging so wide.  We have 
&gt;thought about making wiper pivots with shorter arc travel for taller volks!

Not a bad idea.  Mine seem like there's plenty of room to add a bit of length to either the arm or the blades w/o hitting the rubber at the ends of travel.  
I'll check the length tonite.

We certainly had plenty of rain over the weekend, which gave me a chance to test mine.  With Rain-X, they're adequate for all but a toad-strangler.
