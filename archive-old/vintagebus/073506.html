Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

It really does sound like a carb issue.   do you have another carb you could 
put on it?

Or swap the one you have onto another VW to see if it gives the other VW the 
same problem?

I haven't heard of the 30/31 having cleaning out issues (like the 34s do), 
but maybe this one does for some reason.  I mean, on the 34s I've cleaned them 
out and still had the idling issue.  Heard there is a hidden passage somewhere, 
but haven't cleaned one out since I heard that, and forget where the secret 
passage is.

 I spent the last few days removing the carb, cleaning it, putting it back on,
 I even replaced the fuel lines ( they were old and nasty) The timing is
 correct. The fuel cut-off is working.  Any ideas of where to look next?  the
 bus starts and runs as long as you keep your foot on the pedal.  As soon as
 you take it off, the bus winds down like you shut the key off.   The engine 
in
 question is a 1600 DP with a brosol 30/31.  Anyone have any suggestions 
before
 I give up and take it to the mechanic (I don't really want to.) &gt;&gt;
