Subject: Re: [VB] foreign goodies

&gt;Hey guys and gals..
&gt;I have a friend over in Prague and he offered to pick me up something
&gt;for my bus....
&gt;Are there any goodies over there that aren't available over here?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;--

I think most everything is available here - for a price.  I bet stuff is
cheaper over there.  How about bulb-type headlights, ambulance fans, and
steering column locks?  Blaupunkt radios to fit your original dashboard.
DP intake manifolds with the 30/31 sized carb flange.  That's more than
enough to fill his luggage!
