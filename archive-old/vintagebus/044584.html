Thanks to those that responded to my previous wheel locking query. The
free play on the plunger rod into the master cylinder was mentioned a
couple of times. How much play should there be and how do you measure
it? Is the amount of travel on the brake pedal before it meets
resistance what I need to measure?

crawl unde rthe front of your bus and find the master cylinder.  take off the 
belley pan if it is there.  now see the brake pedal?  pull it down like you 
are using the brakes.    (I do this to bleed the front brakes by myself)  Now 
just pull it a reall small amount.   The rod it pushes into the MC which 
activate sthe MC should have just a tad of space before it activate sthe MC.  
I forget the exact amount, but just a mm I suppose.  ENough for it not to be 
on all the time, and not too much that it will be wasted leg motion or 
prevent you from getting all the braking power you can .   There is a lock 
nut on the rod you can adjust the rod with, usually rusted up  glee glee.
