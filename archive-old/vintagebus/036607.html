&lt;&lt;  have a 65 Bus with a drivers door that is stuck closed...the latch will 
not 
 release, the button pushes in and the inside handle turns, but the bar that 
 connects it to the latch just flexes...this bus has been sitting a few 
years, 
 is there anyway to get the latch to release without mangling the door?
  &gt;&gt;
when you push the button on the outside door handle, that is supposed to push 
a lever that actually springs the door open.  often it has rust and can even 
stick.  It was very dificult to open the doors in my 65 when I got it.

  Use penetrating oil and spray liberally from the inside( panel off or 
pulled back out of the way.  Push the outside handle button, dont pull the 
inside handle.    You can even undo the two scrws holding the OS handle on 
(the ones with the indented hex, forget the name, YKWIM) and you can see the 
lever to push.  Push it.  the door hinges too may be rusted shut.  squirt 
them with oil.    enjoy.    hope this helps.  did you get the doors 
openalready?
