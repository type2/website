Subject: Transport companies

Question is if anyone has dealt with Southerland Auto Transport, Inc. from Anderson, CA in the past?

It's been six weeks since I placed order to ship my Bus and as of today no carrier has been
assigned. I have been extremely patient so far and very polite but today they gave me an earful when
I called to check on the status of my order. I have an option to cancel and loose $200.00 or pay
extra $200.00 to speed-up the order. Is this some kind of a scam? It seems to me that my order will
be sitting on the bottom shelf until I come-up with the extra money...
