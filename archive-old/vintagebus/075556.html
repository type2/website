The pulley being messed up might be your problem.  On the other hand, if
the belt was slipping or getting chewed up by the wobbly pulley, you'd
probably get a burning rubber smell, which doesn't seem to be what you
got.  You might spin the alternator shaft (no belt installed) and see
if turns smoothly (good) or is noisy or grindy (bad).  Maybe also push
the shaft forwards and backwards; if there's a lot of play in it that
may also indicate a bad bearing.

&gt;Does the alt. come out the same way in the bus as in a bug?

Sort of.  Muir advises that in the Bus, you take off the fan before
you get the generator off the engine, instead of removing generator+fan
as a unit on the Bug.  But this was also for a stock generator on a
1200 or 1500.  I haven't messed with one that was still in the car so
I don't know for sure.
