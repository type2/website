Does anyone know where the shows are listed for the LA area?  Since I have to 
go down that a way for a Disney Land trip around April/May I was thinking of 
maybe doing something for myself like hitting one of those awsome So. Cal 
shows........  OCTO?  Besides, the wife will luv it.  Never saw a real life 
BD deluxe.  TIA
