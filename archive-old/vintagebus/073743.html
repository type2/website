&gt;I don't like, and very rarely use, the terms &quot;Split Window&quot; or &quot;Splittie&quot;
&gt;Early buses came first.  They are buses.  Bay window buses are ... bay window
&gt;buses.  The term &quot;split window&quot; implies that they have to be distinguished
&gt;from buses - but they are buses.  Also, the window isn't split - there are two
&gt;of them. If I have to refer to my bus such that I distinguish it from a bay
&gt;window bus then I call it &quot;my early bus&quot;  or &quot;my 60.&quot;  Am I alone in this?  Do
&gt;I need to just get a grip?
&gt;  
&gt;
Same here...............

A &quot;Split window&quot; to me is a '52 and earlier Bug, I never use the term 
&quot;Beetle&quot; either.
