&gt;   I really like bright colors on vehicles, especially easily dented vehicles. Here in foggy Fresno, my RAL2000 colored doublecab GLOWS, it's so bright. I figure it's 2-3 times more visible than a white or light colored car. Hopefully it burns through the cell-phone-dulled brains of the idiot drivers.  Get Thom's opinion on this with his VINTAGEBUS panel. You've seen his pictures, right? Just wear some shades while working on yours, or turn down the garage lights.
