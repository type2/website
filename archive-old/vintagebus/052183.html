    Summary: '66 Westy  abandoned project van  (Waltham,
             Massachusetts)

I thought I might do some work, but that didn't happen. The body is in rough 
shape with plenty of rust. The engine works, but this will probably have to 
be relegated to parts. I really would like to get rid of this, so make me an 
offer. Interior has rear seat/bed and passenger side closet. Front axle is 
good.
