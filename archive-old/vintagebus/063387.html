Subject: Re: [VB] dusty air heater vents

&gt;From: &quot;Heath, Raymond E&quot; &lt;raymond.e.heath_at_boeing_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I have wiped soot several times off the surface of my dash around the
&gt;heater vents. [...] A lot of it looks like internal vent line rust but
&gt;some looks like the sooty dust and dirt that comes off the oil cooler
&gt;fins.

I would associate soot more with exhaust, like a leak in a heater box.
If you had a regular Bus, and the soot was coming from around the oil
cooler, I would think it would tend to show up more around the rear
heater log than anywhere else.  Some of the air to the left heat exchanger
has to go by the oil cooler (non-doghouse) and the left heat exchanger
feeds the rear log only.  But since you have a SC, both heat exchangers
feed up front. 

You might try this: replace all the seals and weatherstripping on the
doors, windows, and overhead vent to get the cab sealed up well.  Park
the Bus outside.  Get some VW lawyers and load them in the cab, then
start the engine with the heater going full blast.  If they pass out
after awhile, then you probably have an exhaust leak from one of the
heater boxes. 

If you don't have any lawyers handy, you might try something that would
make the problem show up more.  For example, have someone else temporarily
block the exhaust pipe with a wet rag while you sit in the cab and check
for increased exhaust smell from the vent.  Or, pour just a little light
oil in the carb to lay down a smoke screen and check for smoke coming
out of the vent.

How are your pushrod tube seals and valve cover seals?  On my Bus,
the pushrod tube seals are not great and the heater boxes are usually
covered in a thin film of oil.  They're brand new and not rusty, so I
don't think too much oil is getting under the shell, but I do get an
oily smell from the vent sometimes.

&gt;Is there anything on the market for filtering the cabin air. Maybe an 
&gt;inline filter at the flexible heater box attach points?

Lots of new cars have cabin air filters but I don't know if there are
any retrofit systems.  Anything you do will probably increase the back
pressure in the heating system and reduce the amount of air you get
up front - maybe not as bad in an SC since you get twice as much air
up front anyway.  One quick and dirty thing to try that doesn't even
involve crawling under the car: take the fresh air hoses off the fan
housing and put cheesecloth or maybe some paper cut from a vacuum bag
over the fresh air spigots, then reconnect the hoses.  After a few
days you could check the cloth/paper for signs of soot.

Good luck!
