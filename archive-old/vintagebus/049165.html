Chad:

I think you missed my point, which doesn't surprise me.  I don't knock anyone for what they do to their bus.  I knock people who knock other people for what they do to their buses, like you.  Do you see the difference?

I could give a rat's ass if you lowered your Double Cab.  It's your bus, do what you want with it.  If you check the archives you'll see that I've never knocked anyone for how they drive, maintain or restore their bus. 

Yes, I'm a stock guy.  I don't consider my views any better or worse than anyone else.  When I need help I often go to the list.  When I see other people asking for help I try to help, or I keep my mouth shut.  My point with my pointed post was I think we should have more help exchanged and less badgering.

Hope that clears it up. 

Robert
