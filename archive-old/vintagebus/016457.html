I don't think anyone's torqued at Kimball.

Everyone's been torqued with SOTO since the dawn of time, it seems.

Well, there's KP, and SVII's are working on a central-cal/bay area show.

There's the beginnings of a groundswell to start up the W-X swap again.

Or maybe we should all move to AZ - seems there's a show every other weekend.
At least it's not as long of a drive to get from Nor-AZ to So-AZ   

I could move to Havasu and be a real pain in the AZ
