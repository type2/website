Subject: Air Cleaner Decals

From Wolfsburg West I recieved one of their repo air cleaner decals and tryed to fit it onto the top of the air cleaner. It does not fit....... both top and bottom of the decal which curves to match the air cleaner profile have wrinkles top and bottom. it just will not fit the compound curve of the surface. Their is a decal solution that &quot;softens&quot; these water decals and may try this. Anybody have experience with this??

Are there also any repo's made for a '67 bus air cleaner???
