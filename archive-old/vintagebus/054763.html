Subject: Re: [VB] OCTO pix/non-buying

It's funny about the non-buying aspect.

My son and I found a set of 2 tone door panels for his '63 ragtop bug.  The owner was
so busy talking to his friends, that we had to stand there for a few minutes, until one
of his other friends interupted them so we could ask how much he wanted for them.  His
price seemed a little high, so we said we would &quot;Walk around&quot; on it for awhile.  When
we came back to make an offer, the owner was gone, his friend was there, but could not
take anything less than the owner quoted us the first time.  We said we'd be back.
Walked around for another 45 minutes, (lets face it, going back to look at Joseph
Crokett's Westy is a worthwhile walk), went back to see the guy-still not there.
Walked around for another 1/2 hour, went back-guy STILL not there.  I noticed that he
hadn't sold much of anything since we walked by the first time.  So we gave up.  The
ironic thing is-I bet he is a guy that always complains because he can't seem to sell
anything.  I know it's not the mall, or a retail store or anything, but some vendors
just don't get it.  Go figure.

&gt; Yeah, a great show in terms of quality busses. Some
&gt; GREAT campers. The Westies (and a sweet dormobile) get
&gt; lots of attention. People seem to spend more time with
&gt; them, looking at all the neat little stuff.
&gt;
&gt; I've got to agree with Everett about the non-buying. I
&gt; think it had something to do with high prices. 800 for
&gt; an incomplete sunroof mechanism. $125 for a middle
&gt; seat end panel (seemed steep, until the next guy I saw
&gt; with one wanted $250. CRAP! I paid less than that for
&gt; my SEAT! Upholstered nonetheless)
&gt;
&gt; And does anyone know what was up with that front end
&gt; that looked like it was sitting on the bottom of the
&gt; ocean for 40 years? The thing looked like it came off
&gt; the Titanic. In my opinion, salvagable only as an art
&gt; piece (Actually, I did hear someone comment that
&gt; Everett would buy it and put it in his front yard)
&gt;
&gt; Some guy had a fake 23 window bus on a trailer he
&gt; wanted 4800. It was more of a shell, primered, crust
&gt; and Bondo evident everywhere. Then there was a
&gt; Barndoor panel parked on the street. What were they
&gt; asking, 8000? It looked like it was gone from the
&gt; rockers down.
&gt;
&gt; I even got into the action. I was putting a something
&gt; in DARTHVW and a guy asked if it was for sale. Joking,
&gt; I said, &quot;Sure, ten grand!&quot; He nodded and replied &quot;Not
&gt; bad.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to sound salty, I know that if I ever
&gt; wanted to sell my bus I'd want top dollar, who
&gt; wouldn't? But it's all relative I guess.
&gt;
&gt; On the flip side, there were some deals, I got a very
&gt; straight pair of overriders for my 69 for $10 and a
&gt; near perfect splash pan for $10. I even got an OG sump
&gt; plate with drain nut for free. The guy said that I
&gt; could just have it. I gave him a buck for good karma.
&gt;
&gt; All in all though, I am very thankful I live out here,
&gt; close to such a great organization and so many busses.
&gt; to get a show like that a couple times a year, Pomona
&gt; every other month, the classic, WCM and WW and other
&gt; vendors, etc. No complaints. plus, the weather lets me
&gt; get away with no sunroof skin :^)

&gt; &gt; Hi, I went to the OCTO Bus show this weekend, photos

&gt; &gt; The show was pretty cool.  I spent $10 on a couple
&gt; &gt; heater boxes for my un-Bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least 150 Buses were there.  Seemed to be a
&gt; &gt; decent amount of selling
&gt; &gt; but maybe not a lot of buying?  A bunch of mid 60s
&gt; &gt; middle seats were there
&gt; &gt; but only 1 back seat and a cople front seats.  A lot
&gt; &gt; of front ribbed bumpers,
&gt; &gt; none of which seemed to change hands.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I saw someone driving around in a restored
&gt; &gt; Barndoor(?) Deluxe around 6 am
&gt; &gt; near Huntington Beach but they didn't seem to appear
&gt; &gt; at the show, strange.
