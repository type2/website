I too can't use the letters MRS together, which is probably a good

&gt; What's &quot;web&quot;?  Is that the thing rich people have on their newfangled tvs?

&gt; I get the list through the fillings in my teeth.  I respond by clicking
&gt; my teeth together; each tooth is a letter of the alphabet.  I'm worried
&gt; because next week I get my molars out and I won't be able to use the letters
&gt; m, r, s, and x.
