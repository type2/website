&gt; &gt;You may feel safer with a sticker of approval from Big Brother, but it's
&gt; &gt;likely to be just an illusion!
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, responsibility!
&gt; 
&gt; In a state without inspections, you have the freedom to keep your car
&gt; in as good a state of repair as you like.  You have an incentive to
&gt; maintain it somewhat, because then it doesn't break down as much and
&gt; cause you grief.  But if you want to run the brake linings down to
&gt; the rivets, or skip the cotter pins in your rear axle nuts, you are
&gt; free to do so.

You can do this in an inspection state too.  In fact, what's to stop
someone from putting off needed work until the car will be in the
shop anyway for the inspection?  Inspections only occur every year or two
and are no guarantee of roadworthyness.

Of course, the ultimate goal might be to require all work be done by a
certified mechanic like the airplane folks do.  It could very well become 
illegal to do your own work unless you can get it signed off by a
licensed mechanic.  This would delight the repair industry since it would
open up even more work for them.

&gt; &gt; At least, that is, until you can't stop and rear-end ME.  Or your
&gt; wheel comes off on the highway and comes through my windshield.
&gt; Then I have an interest in how you take care of your car, too.

Of course, these occurances never happen in inspection states!  I know of
no studies showing that inspections truly improve safety in a measurable
way.  The study I cited earlier actually negated this theory.  The bare
fact is that inspections are a feel-good program with nothing to back them
up.

 &gt; I agree that the current system of inspections is not perfect
and &gt; could use changes.  It either needs to not exist at all (I would
&gt; not prefer this) or have some teeth in it (TUeV, anyone?)

No.  This is the US and I'm not ready for Big Brother to stick his nose
into yet another facet of my life.
&gt; 
&gt; On TUeV and the German safety laws: Yep, they're pretty strict.
&gt; As an example, if you own a split or early bay with drum front
&gt; brakes, you are REQUIRED to convert to discs before getting your
&gt; license.  On the other hand, you'd probably like to have good
&gt; brakes when you're doing 80 (OK, a T4 Bay)

All T4 bays already had disk brakes.  An early bay is lucky to hit 70 on
the flat.  If you're smart enough to increase the power in a split, you
are smart enough to upgrade the brakes or to drive within their limits.

&gt; on the Autobahn and
&gt; suddenly have to slow down to 60 because of a big truck.  The
&gt; people in the Benz passing you at 100 also appreciate that your
&gt; vehicle is in good working order. 

They'd appreciate it even more if your vehicle wasn't there at all and
that you were driving a nice NB or something.  They would think of it as
&quot;getting those old junkers off the roads&quot;.

&gt; &gt;I'm also leery of annual inspections, as they can be a step toward
&gt; &gt;&quot;clunker laws&quot; that make it difficult or impossible to drive the older
&gt; &gt;vehicles that we all love.
&gt; 
&gt; Funny, this is how I feel about smog inspections (as opposed to
&gt; straight safety inspections).

Both types of inspections lead to the same thing.

&lt;smog credit stuff snipped&gt;

&gt; Old-car enthusiasts understandably freaked when this started
&gt; happening.  At first you couldn't get anything off the doomed
&gt; cars, not even the brake drums or side trim.  I believe this
&gt; has been relaxed - it's sufficient to remove the engine and
&gt; drivetrain (more 36hp parts gone forever) and the body can
&gt; be salvaged as normal.

I still think that it is complete destruction  in California,

George
