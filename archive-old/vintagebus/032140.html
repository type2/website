                      buses behind a barn                          5/23/99
Found a few VW's behind a barn a few days ago that I want to get some feed 
back on.  First one is a 65ish with windows all the way around, no little 
ones on top and no sun roof.  I think it was a walk through.  Had lots of 
engine parts, rust city, on the inside but the sides were fairly straight 
with somewhat intact interior and had all the seats and things like that.  
Second one was a camper, no pop up, but had crank out windows,again with lots 
of crap inside. (why do they do that).  It did however have the tent, 
slightly lived in by mice, and what looked like to be lots of polls, I assume 
for the tent.  Third was a single cab that had the tool box area amputated 
and was lowered.  It had some rust but wasn't all that bad.  There was also a 
station wagon that was in about the same condition.  Question is:  What is it 
worth?  A few of the parts I could use on my 59 single cab but, not that 
many.  Is a guy better off striping something like that and trying to make 
his money back!
 selling latches and handles at a swap meet, or are there people  out there 
looking for builders?  Any feed back is appreciated.....
== = = = = = = 

yes people are looking for buses to fix up.     

since parked bus are boxlike and have doors, they tend to become storage 
sheds.   What are those buses worth?  depends on how straight/ dented and 
rusty/non rusty they are mostly.    If it rolls it is worth at least a 
hundred or two hundred bucks.     Also depends where you are.   Me myself I 
would rather hear of them getting saved than stripped.  I had a rusty SC FS 
cheap, but waited till it would find a home where it would get fixed and 
driven, rather than stripped and cut up, just cause.  

btw whose are these?  better find the owner of the barn  and sort something 
out (and where is the paperwork) before making plans for the buses.
