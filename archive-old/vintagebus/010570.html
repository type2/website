Subject: Re: [VB] main tank size

The most I have been able to put in a tank is 10.6 gallons.   On my 61 it 
runs out after 200 miles and then have a gallon or two when I pull the knob.  
 I would let it run out,  use the tap and see how many miles you get from 
fill up.  

but carry a gas can with you.  Just in case.  Till you figure it out.

 I recently got the reserve tap working in my 1960 Standard bus, so
 I've become more willing to drive closer to the edge of running out
 (since then all I have to do is switch tanks and find a gas station).
 However, my most recent fill-up (which didn't involve switching tanks)
 had me putting in 10.24 US gallons.  How big *is* the main tank?  I'm
 worried that the reserve switch is backwards (although I didn't get
 sputtering when I experimented with switching over before filling up),
 or that the pick up tubes are damaged such that I'm effectively always
 on reserve.  It'd be a real bummer to run out, switch to reserve, and
 find nothing there....
