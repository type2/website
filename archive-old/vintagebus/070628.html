Subject: Re: [VB] Center Pivot Bushing

Helped a friend replace his center pivot bushing and pin today.
Unless a normal bus, the problem with his was that it was way too
*tight*!  Steering the bus was difficult, and near the end of
the travel in each direction, the poor thing would let out this
&quot;scroink!&quot; sound.
