I've been doing some research on where I can get a good seat-of-the-pants
digital scale for balancing my rods.  I found out that Costco sells a Royal
brand 4lb. postage scale for $24.95 (that's about as cheap as it gets.)
Could I convice someone to pick one up for me?  I'll send the money first,
then you can buy it and send it to me.  Thanks fo' da hep...
