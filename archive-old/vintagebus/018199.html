Now if I got my math correct pressure should be at 15 PSI
up front and 22 in the back since the back is heavier. Right? That's at
least how someone knowledgeable told me to figure my pressure.
===========

i don't know any magic formulas for proper tire pressure...but i believe at 15

psi your tires will be pretty flat, probably dent your rims if you go over any

bumps...i wouldn't go below 28 psi on your tires...
