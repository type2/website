  Hey I want to thank everyone on the list for helping me with my
shifting problem. Bernice my 65 standard had her shift linkage evaporate
one day and I didn't even know what was supposed to be there. You folks
on the list explaned what I was supposed to be seeing as far as shift
linkage and even gave me part numbers. somone told me rockey moutain
motor works had the parts and I ordered them I got everything put back
together and I can find all 4 gears and reverse now!! --thanks-- Now Mr.
No Quarter I could use youre gear shifter extrodanere stataus, to fine
tune Bernices shift5 pattern

65 standard  (Bernice)
73 thing (Rosane) 

god bless
