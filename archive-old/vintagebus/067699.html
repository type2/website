Hi Nick,
We just figured out how to do that without modifying the SC you would just
need to make tanks that would grab/vice onto the under side of the frame work
under the bed.  Switching would not be needed just run a fuel line from each
to the tank in the normal position.  Just a reserve switch would be a good
idea to tell you when you only have 100+ miles left!

&gt; I want to find like a 50 gallon gas tank that I can put in the treasure
&gt; chest of my single cab..I think that would be so cool! id only have to fill
&gt; up once a year :)

&gt;Hi Nick,
&gt;Hmm, only about 1200 mile range if you get 24 MPG.  That would last us less
than &gt;half a year!  ;-(    Would be cool to build two or more slip in tanks
for the tool bay, &gt;but figuring out how to strap them down without
cutting/welding on the SC would be &gt;the problem.
