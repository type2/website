Subject: Re: [VB] Re: new Coleman portable heater

Hi Bob,
The Coleman site lists these as ideal for (&lt;&lt;Use it in your tent, garage, 
shop, ice shanty or the house if the power goes out. &gt;&gt;) and none of them are 
small autos.  They are either much larger in size and/or better ventilated 
places.  Even in RVs that use this kind of heating system RV suppliers warn 
that a low oxygen alarm must be used!
