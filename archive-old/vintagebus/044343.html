Subject: front drums and heat

I've put about 100 miles on my bus since I repacked the front wheel 
bearings and hubs and adjusted the front brakes. How hot should the 
brake drums be when I touch them after driving 20 miles or so? My 
passenger one SEEMS to be a tad hotter than the driver's side when i 
touch it.

I'm gonna check and make sure I don't have the brakes in a little too 
far on that one. Just wanted to see if there is some &quot;rule of thumb&quot; 
on this one...kinda like the dipstick test.

in case you didn't notice, I'm paranoid.
