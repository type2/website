&lt;&lt; Ok here is the scoop. I am going to sandblast my 65 delux bus soon and I
 would like some tips on what I should do before and after. I have never
 sandblasted before and I heard it is very messy. But it is alot better
 then hand sanding.  &gt;&gt;

Well, its a lot easier than hand sanding, that's for sure. However, you 
should thing about a different media other than sand. The body panels on a 
bus are too large and easily warped by the heat generation of sand,even with 
the finest grades. You'll end up spending a lot more time afterwards with the 
bondo and a sanding block trying to get back the straightness in the panels.. 
The people doing real restoration work on classic cars would never consider 
using sand for body panels when there are so many better alternatives out 
there. But then again , it depends on wheter you're looking for show quality 
or just a daily driver you can just clean up and paint.
