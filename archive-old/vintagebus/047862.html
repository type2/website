Hi David,
Well we have done this in our state and one just has to get a three year 
title.  If the last registered owner shows up in the three year period then 
they can reclaim it, but after that period it is all yours.  So if you make 
improvmeant it is very important to get reciepts from buying parts and taking 
lots of pictures just in case you have to turn it over and get your part 
money back.  Also you might want to check out neighboring states and see if 
they are easier to title it.  Talk to fellow VWers in those states and maybe 
one of them can title the VW for you and then sell it back to for a buck!  If 
memory serves us right Alabama state is one of the easiest.   Eric&amp;Barb
