Doesn't sound too bad to me. Assuming it's auto (safety) glass,
cut-to-fit, edges finished. For a Westy with 15 slats (20 if you include
the smaller non-opening ones), $75-100 doesn't seem like much compared
to what you'd probably pay for original glass (if you could find it).&gt;&gt;

Wilder-

Didn't look at it that way: indeed, it doesn't sound so bad when you put
it like that.
