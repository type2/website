I have heard a lot of feedback about the freeway flier tranny.  Is this a 
brand name?  I have never heard of it til now.  Most respondents have stated 
it sucks for hills and valleys but works great for flatlands.  Well, Florida 
is as flat as this country gets but I do like to cruise in the mountains at 
least once a year (more often if work allows).  Is it just plain bad in 
mountainous terrain or just not good for continuos use in mountainous 
terrain?
