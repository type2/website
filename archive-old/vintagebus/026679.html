&gt; Well everyone - the city is hassling me again over my bus.  I have an
&gt; 'unregistered vehicle' that has been on the property for more than 21 days
&gt; so I have 21 days to remove it, put it behind an enclosure, or get a fined
&gt; $100 per day I'm in violation -

[...]

&gt; So I can do one of 2 things - I can either put up a couple more fence panels
&gt; (which I have) and hide it in the backyard or
&gt; I can really piss off a bunch of people by painting this thing up, calling
&gt; it art, and really stir up a hornets nest (which I would love to do.)  Is
&gt; there a precedence that I can follow in this regard?  I'd hate to paint up
&gt; my bus with all the flowers and all, call it my &quot;artistic expression of the
&gt; VW auto world&quot; and still get fined and hornswaggled by the city.  Are my
&gt; chances very good that if I pursue the 1st admendment, the city, out of
&gt; abiding by Federal Law and out of frustration, would leave me alone?

Hey NQ,
You bring back memories of my nightmares of dealing with my city over the same
issue.  Based upon what I went through, I wouldn't even attempt to try the paint
route and be left with a huge bill that would be better spent on parts.  I'm not
sure which one of us has the worst &quot;second option&quot; after hiding the bus.  If I
didn't get it running or hide it, the city had the date set for the tow trucks
to show up, disappear the truck and I would get a bill for removal with no
options discussed for return of the truck.  You don't loose the truck, but at
$100 bucks a day, I don't think I'd want to keep it.

&gt; One more note - there are 2 other auto restorers within a couple blocks of
&gt; me and they've left vehicles out on the street for more than 24 hours and
&gt; when I do, I get warnings whereas they leave their stuff sit for weeks.  I'm
&gt; not as rich as them either so money plays a part in it as well.
&gt;

I think it's simpler than that.  You have someone in your neighborhood that
complains to the city while, nobody has complained about the auto restorers.
Since the auto restorers are most likely in commercial zones, there may be
different regulations about parked vehicles around their business.  Usually the
zoning laws are set to keep residential zones from looking like commercial
zones.

&gt; Anyway, for now, I'm gonna put up a fence panel and keep it in the backyard
&gt; until I get the engine done but man, this gets really really old.  When I
&gt; drag the bus out again to work on it, I'll get another letter so I'm gonna
&gt; have to do something different.
&gt;

Good luck.

Scott
