Subject: Re: [VB] hot wire at light switch

That's a great Idea as well. I just finished doing the switch and fuse box in my '60 Singlecab and it makes a HUGE difference. It's pretty easy to do or there is a guy on the Samba that sells refurbished ones. (hazetguy)

Hi Volks,
Also a good idea to solder the brass clips together in each socket of the 
1961-67 fuse boxes and solder the riveted connections in the earlier ones.
