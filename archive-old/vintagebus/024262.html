Subject: Re: 12v system 6v wiper motor?
References: &lt;199810151643.JAA20702_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I have run a 6 volt motor in 2 12 volt buses for almost 5 years
now....no problems at all!!..

I buy the little ceramic voltage drops from NAPA Auto parts...I run 2 in
line....that means 

-The power from my wiper switch runs to the 'battery' terminal on the
voltage drop
-The out put side of the first voltage drop is run to the 'battery' side
of the second voltage drop...
-Then the output of the second voltage drop goes straight to the wiper
motor positive terminal...

Easy as pie....I run 2 in line since checking just one drop with a volt
meter...the meter said each v.drop only drops the current by 3 volts?
Strange but I ran 2 in line and checked again...a perfect 6 volts...

Good luck Todd S


&gt; I understand that if I use ONE volt-a-drop with a 6v wiper motor on a
&gt; 12v-converted '65 I will fry the wiper motor... how do I use *TWO*
&gt; volt-a-drops in series (??) to operate the wiper motor without destroying
&gt; the workings?
