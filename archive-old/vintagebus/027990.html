&gt; Mercedes made this bus-looking thing.  It used the exact same headlights.
&gt; I can't recall the model of this puppy, but it came in several different
&gt; configurations.  I know of one in Sacramento that's like the &quot;deluxe&quot;
&gt; version, complete with &quot;corner windows&quot;
&gt;

There's one up here (Nor Cal) that is a camper version. Not sure if it's original
or not, but I'd take it. Looks *very* similar to a Bus only bigger and not as
&quot;rounded&quot;
