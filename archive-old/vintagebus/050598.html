&gt;&gt; You might look at the '65 wiring diagram on vintagebus_dot_com and make
&gt;&gt; sure the switch and motor are hooked up right.  Your Bus should have
&gt;&gt; the two-speed motor and switch, which is more wires for the PO to
&gt;&gt; get hooked up wrong.
&gt;
&gt;er- no- 65 has a one year only one speed wiper motor that is self parking.

Oops.  I was looking at the '66 wiring diagram.  Neither the '66 diagram
(two speed self parking) or the '63-'65 diagram (one speed non self
parking) will likely apply to you.  Bentley does mention the self-parking
motor for '65 on page E-12 8 but doesn't give a wiring diagram.  Most
self-parking wipers need an extra always-hot wire to the motor (besides
the wire coming from the wiper switch) to work.

&gt;&gt; It could be.  Your Bus would originally have been equipped with a
&gt;&gt; 6v hazard and turn signal flasher (also known as the &quot;9 prong box&quot;).
&gt;
&gt;no again, 65 does NOT have the 9 prong box.

Oops again, I was looking at the '66 diagram again.  Clara is right.

&gt;The 6 came with a three prong flasher for the turn signals, and a 4 
&gt;prong flasher for the e- lights on the right hand side.

The round thing (item J on the '62-'65 diagram) is the flasher and the 
four-prong thing (item J1) is actually a relay to make the front lights
flash when the hazards are on.

If your turn signals work (the flasher clicks and both front and rear
lights on that side blink), and the brake lights are working, then
the hazards should at least flash both rear lights.  If you have
a marginal connection like Clara mentioned, it could make it so the
rear lights can't draw enough current to trigger the flasher in hazard
mode.  Also if the relay (J1) is fouled up it can cause the front lights
to not flash in hazard mode.

I don't have a write-up on the '62-'65 flashers.  The 9-prong box article
I mentioned won't apply.

&gt;But before assuming you have a 6V/12V problem, you could try cleaning
&gt;up all the connectiond (or at least wiggling them) and checking to 
&gt;see if the light bulbs are still good.

Especially check the grounds at the tail lights (try running a jumper
wire from the tail light housing or bulb holder to a good ground) and
the connections at the right tail light; if the battery is loose it can
slide back and bash them.

Sorry for the confusion on the year.  The list keeps me honest once
again.  :)
