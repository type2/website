Importance: Normal
Subject: ceramic coated headers/exhaust

I dont ever recall hearing anyones respons to these things. are they worth
it-do they actually make a difference in engine temps, horsepower, noise or
longevity? I have also recently heard about this exhaust wrap stuff. It
appears as though you wrap it around a header upon installation.it is
supposed to insulate the header-thereby increasing exhaust temps? reducing
engine temps?not sure why this helps.

what type of exhaust systems do most of you use? Currently i have what i
think is a single &quot;quiet pack&quot;

What do you guys recommend for a quieter ride or for more horse power, or
for both. I think i just like it to be quiet, and if i can get a few more
horsepower for a few more bucks-ok...

thanks for any suggestsions
