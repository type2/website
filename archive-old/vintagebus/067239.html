&gt; Ok, I've got only the stock heater in my '67 13-window, and I'm freezing on

&gt; But I do want to at least be warm in the winter with my stock heater.  The
&gt; heater in my Beetle will burn you the heat is so hot (I measured it once,
&gt; 170 degrees), but the one in my bus just sucks.

The reason that the bus heater is less effective than the bug heater is
that both heaters are identical and the bus is a lot bigger box to heat.
There are a few things you can do to improve the situation, but don't
expect miracles!

1. Make sure that your thermostat and flaps are installed and working.  ON
a cold day, the flaps remain partially closed, diverting more air to the
heater boxes.
2. Make sure that the entire heat system from fan shroud to outlets is
intact and sealed.  It doesn't take too many air leaks to lose a lot of
heat.  It took quite a bit of work to get mine tight.
3. Make sure that the main heat duct under the bus is well-insulated.  If
the insulation is missing you lose heat through the duct.
4. Made sure that the bus body is well sealed.  If you have a big draft
coming in through rust holes or bad door seals the heat won't have a
chance.  You _do_ have to leave an air outlet if the body is _really_ well
sealed, though.
5. If your bus has rear heat outlets, make sure tha they are closed on
days that you don't need them.

If the above do not help enough, it's time for a gas heater!
