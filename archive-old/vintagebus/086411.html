Subject: Re: [T2] Angle Grinder and Door Handle Removal

Hi James,

AMEN to that!!!!  I used a cheapo wire wheel to rework the front skin  
of the sunroof bus I had, and after less than 10 minutes I looked  
like a porcupine. All the little pieces of wire that had flown off  
the wheel had embedded themselves in my t-shirt!!!

Cheap stripping tools are not worth the bother.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

.Wire disks and cups, get the primo ones.  The cheap ones are a waste  
of time.
