&gt; Just received a pair of supposedly NOS heat exchanges from the bus depot,
&gt; the ones meantioned earlier that are much better than the DAnsk. Shouldn't
&gt; VW NOS parts have VW part  numbers somehwere?


These are absolutely, positively NOS Volkswagen.  Read the comments in the
archives from the many people who have received them if you have any doubt.
Some I got still had the VW stickers on them (yes, VW merely used stickers,
not an engraved part number). On others they had peeled off over time, but
all were identical and clearly different from the Danish ones made today.
Look at any of today's Dansk heat exchangers and you'll see the difference
instantly.
