&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi Bob.  Wanna tell me who does good work and who to avoid?  :  )
&gt;
&gt; Me too!  I'm in Annapolis and looking for someone to do some welding, and
&gt; the only name I have gotten is Best Foreign in Severna Park.

the guy who does most of my welding is Bruce Wilson on Central Ave in
Baltimore, he works almost exclusively on vans and is one of the few
people I know who actually has figured out the Fuel injection system well
enough to pinpoint most problems right away.
 He is Slow, and erratic but he is very very good and his prices are
reasonable.
  his building has no sign but his number is 410 925 2688 make an
appointment, and take a book with you if he is on time it will be the
first time, he's is worth the wait though.

also down that way is Dicks in Wye Mills right over the bridge
410-827-6501

stay away from George on Ft Smallwood road the guy has no clue about
anything newer than 1954, but he is a good place to get parts.

Bob
