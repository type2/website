Subject: what year is it?
Message-ID: &lt;36E75C32.2007_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

I have finally found a donor body for my crashed '67
It is straight but has a little rust and is very restorable
I cant find the M-code plate on it anywhere and cant ascertain what year
it is.
It has the smaller rear hatch which suggests pre '63 and &quot;bullet&quot; front
turn indicators.
But it has the same large oval brake/indicators as my '67, so Im
thinking maybe '63 or early '64.
Are these brake lights original or have they been put on afterwards.
It also has the air vents above the waist (Australian Alternative?)
Anyone got any Idea ?

Regards, Daniel
