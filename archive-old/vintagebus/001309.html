For those of you who requested name tags to be picked up at the show, Harry
Houck has been unsuccessful in his valiant efforts to have his orange juice
colored (as yet unnamed) crewcab ready for the trip. You will have to look
for Rosie unescorted. If any of you who did not receive a picture of her,
p-mail me before noon (departure time) and I will send you one.

'63 Crewcab (Rosie the Rocket Sled)
'65 Karmann Ghia (Sleeping Survivor)

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
