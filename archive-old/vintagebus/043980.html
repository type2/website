Re: the starter bushing problem.
The more common problem with the bushings are found in the conversion with
the aftermarket bushings made to fit the 6V starter into the 12V housing.
Those bushings are paper thin and don't seem to last very long.
I also find that a dab of lubricant should be applied to the bushing each
time the starter is pulled.
Another thing about the solenoid....I have used a heavy handled
screwdriver to bang on the solenoid, gone back to the ignition key, turned
it and then had the motor fire up just like its supposed to.
later
