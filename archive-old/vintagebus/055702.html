Subject: Found,  singlecab, Long with bus content

 As I wrote in an earlier post follow all leads no matter how vague. Here's
the story on this on. Bought a rebuilt starter from Checker for the rail and
it was wrong as I needed the auto style so I went back last Sat to exchange
it and they were out, so got refund and went over to Autozone (had not been
in there for years). They had one and while I was talking to the counter guy
and guy up on a ladder says hello. Turns out he worked for me when I managed
a machine shop in Havasu about 12 years ago. He asks me what have I been
doing and I tell him still doing the old vw bus thing. He tells me he thinks
he knows where and old vw pickup is out by Searchlight NV. Thinks it is a 60
or 61 and the lady might want to sell it. Said he was not interested and I
said I was. He said it was a couple miles off the highway on a dirt road on
the Vegas side of Searchlight. So I get home and ask Denise if I can go play
in the desert Sun and look for the lady and bus. Sun. was her day off and we
were going to do some stuff in town. Get the OK from her and I head out
early Sun. Must have drove up and down 50 miles of dirt roads on each side
of the highway. Was taking each road as they came by. Take the next left and
head up towards an old house with junk everywhere. Come to an open gate with
no trespassing signs on it and think what the hell, have come to far to turn
around. Pull up to the OLD house and knock on screen door. Cute grandma type
comes out and I ask here if she has an old vw pickup for sale. BINGO it's
her. We talk alittle and she takes me around the back of the house real slow
(she had a heart valve replaced a few years ago and hurt her hip last week
so she has to go slow for awhile) We round the corner and the first thing I
see is a ribbed front bumper on the bus, not a 60 or 61. Get to bus and it
is great. It's a 1958  and 99% complete. Rear bumper and pans, all the glass
is org, even the windshields. Could not find the crank start pan or apron
anywhere. Some dents, but no rust anywhere. Only bummer is the rear
wheelwells are cut and desert tires are on the back. Real faded unpainted
dove blue paint. Make a deal and leave deposit and tell her I will come back
next Sat with some friends and tow it home. Ronnie was going to Vegas anyway
so he followed  and Art road with me. We left Havasu at 6 AM and got to her
place around 8. We left all the tires flat and comealonged the bus up on the
trailor. Had not looked in the treasure chest as it was locked. Pull the
original key out of ing switch and give to Ronnie and it unlocks the door.
Inside is all the crank start stuff and the cleanest rustfree locker I have
seen. Front seats had cloth fabric on them, took that off and the original
black seats a great. Asked her how long she had the bus and she said for a
real long time and had bought from the original owner in Vegas. Then she
brought me the Original NV 1958 title sighed by bank and org owner and never
put in anyone else name, she only drove it around the desert and never did
anything with title. By the dates she bought it on May 14 1959. Title has
engine num also and checked and it is still the org engine thats on title.
So by paper work  its a 1 owner truck. Has 65056 miles on speedo. Will try
and start it today ( was running when parked around 1965). Will offer the
pickup to someone 1st and it they dont want it will post it for sale on
Everrett page in a few days. Also it has original ambl fans in it( which
will go to someone unnamed if buyer doesn't want them). Left door panel and
headliner are torn up and will need replaced. 1 visor only and no holes for
rear view mirror. Will be asking around $3k obo. Anyway thats the story on
following up leads.
