Subject: Re: [VB] Re: VIN Woes

When I went to Kansas, (900mi.), to buy my car the PO took me to the DMV to
get plates. They said, &quot; Hi Don! How ya been ? etc.&quot; They asked for proof of
ins. Didn't have. PO hands me his cell. I call long distance to wife with
VIN. She has liab. faxed to DMV. PO takes me to ritzy Sandwich place to
wait. Go pick up plates; car has no spare, PO takes me to Wal-Mart, I pick
out tire , gets mounted, PO picks up tab. PO takes me to high class hotel,
whips out corporate card and gets me a room; I pay .20 on the dollar and
I've never lived better. PO gives me cell # and wants a call when I get home
safe. I drive veh. never seen before 900 mi. pleasurably and is sweet deal
as well.

&gt; After reading all the stories I realize how lucky I was.  The PO of my
&gt; Bus was a lady at work.  Her husband was in the oil business here in
&gt; Tulsa and got transferred to Houston, so they moved down there and she
&gt; worked from home.  She was back in Tulsa for a meeting and we happened
&gt; to talk VWs and she mentioned wanting to sell her Bus.
