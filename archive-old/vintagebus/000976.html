Hi all,

My speedometer needle seems to be draging a bit and I thought I would
'carefully' disassemble it and see if it was anything obvious...  But I
can't figure out how to take the needle off.  Does it pull off or is it
threaded?

Or, should I just send it off to someone and let them fix/clean it up.  If
so, who does good work.

Thanks
