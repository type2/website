&lt;&lt; yes VW did change the design of the axles slightly, some have the ball, 
some 
 dont.  However, this change was not at the split case/tunnel change, and if 
you read your Bentley in the axle section it does say they are 
interchangable.  its one of those changes I doubt they changed the part 
number for. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
1963 to 67 VW bus Shop Manual Section H-5, near the top of page 3 states:
From April 1964, Chassi No. 1285367, the rear axle shafts and differential 
side gears are paired together again.  At the same time, the spring and ball 
in the axle shaft flange was discontinued.  The fitting clearance between the 
flange if the axle shaft (Measured across the ball-shaped faces) and the 
inside diameter if the side gear is 0.03-0.01mm (.001-.004 in.).
