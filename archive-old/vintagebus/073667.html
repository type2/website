Subject: popouts on a dc...

Regualar popouts will work if you use the later latch as well. You will
only be able to get a few of the screws to line up on the latch but it
will hold. My 60 double cab had later windows and latches in it. It took
me forever to track down the right windows. I never got up the nerve to
put them in because my little girls always played with the windows and
the original early latches look pretty fragile. If you have the correct
windows now I would just replace the glass. Definitely soak the screws
for at least a week before trying to disassemble them. Use liquid wrench
or Pb Blaster or whatever penetrating oil you prefer. The tapping method
described before works great. Drilling and tapping them is not all that
bad, but getting them out the first time is much easier.

good luck,
Craig
