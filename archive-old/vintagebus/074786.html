&gt; I haven't seen this one but I saw a mid-sixtys double cab in similar

&gt; he ended-up selling it for $18,000. Are mid-sixtys double cabs in more
&gt; demand that mid-fiftys single cabs?
&gt;
I would say no they are not as valuable as an early SC- It seems to me that
SC's are on the bottom of the food chain of the commercial buses cuz there
are so many of them?

I agree w/ ellis that you couldn't duplicate that truck for the asking price
but I also have a hard time accepting that a truck like the one in GA. for
$18,000 or the one Lenny sold on the Samba for $23,000 max or less are of
equal value to Van Bondo's  Westy which sold for less than these &quot;simple&quot;
truck restos?????

Tom Buese-guess the value of sumtin is what someone will pay to have it
