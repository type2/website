Subject: Heater Control Cable Installation

No, Really!  I did mess around in the archives!  But here is the ? anyway:
What is the red tube on one of the legs of the new heater control cable for?
The Bentley doesn't mention it...nobody mentions it...and my old broken
cable doesn't have one...so..?

And also:  When the Bentley mentions a longer cable, how much longer is it?
Is it really that hard to tell which end to put into the right-hand tube?
They're really similar!

TIA
