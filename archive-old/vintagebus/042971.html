This is a great idea!  Make it part of the chapter requirements rather
than asking for volunteers.  There are enough chapters to cover the next
couple of years anyway.

There should probably be a general submission pool (for show
announcements, meetings, regular chapter news and the &quot;usual&quot; crew of
writers -- as well as the ads Thom mentioned) so those experiencing
writer's block can have *somewhere* to turn.  There would still need to be
a coordinating editor and I'm not sure how you would standardize on layout
(software, printing, etc.).

I'm willing (but don't tap me too soon as I'm approaching the completion
of five years of continuous service as GROOVE's newsletter editor and
I'm a little burnt too). I'll have to start holding the good stuff back
for NEATO. ;-)

I can't wait to see the Splitzine influenced edition of OBR. =_)
