To: landoweb_at_usa_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

because the original safaris were made with a mold process (not stamped out) 
and it would be cost prohibitive to get them &quot;cheap&quot;


&gt;so why cant some of the experts here be in charge of commisioning a bunch of
&gt;safari kits from some factory somewhere, make sure they are done right , and
&gt;we could all go in on an order of 200 pairs or so, and get them cheap???
