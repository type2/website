Subject: Expensive Sounding Reduction Box Noise
Date: Fri, 19 May 2000 22:57:17 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey everybody:

As some of you know, my Baja is equiped with an early Bus small nut 
reduction box trans. Recently a noise has developed.

Coasting down the rod I hear a squeeky scrape scrape scrape sound. It gets 
louder when I turn right and quieter when I turn left.

I have already checked to make sure the drums are not rubbing on the backing 
plates or shoes. I can't figure out if is coming from a reduction box or the 
transaxle.

Anybody else experience this?
