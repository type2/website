Happy Friday    

Today I was in the new international terminal at the San Francisco Airport.  
The terminal won't be open until this fall, but the City asked my airline 
(think Rhapsody in Blue) to help out with some of the training procedures.  
When you board an airplane the thingie that you walk down that is abutting 
the aircraft is called a loading bridge.  The loading bridges that are being 
used in the new terminal are built in Germany.  As I was checking out the new 
systems I noticed in the lower right hand corner of the window was the 
SEKURIT logo.  I guess this makes the loading bridge &quot;correct&quot; for the 
Vintage crowd.
