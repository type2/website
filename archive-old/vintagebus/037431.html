Hi Jenn,
Did you folks have a banner or some such up?  If you did we were probably too
busy looking for parts to see it.  We meant to put one up at our swap spot,
but things got too busy.  We saw Clara, Jack Maynard, Ty of Ore., Bob
Lessard, and many others of which we have forgot (Darn our bad memories for
names!), and things were as always a bit of a blurr.  Bought a parts jalousy
window for $5.00 off of the same fellow who sold us our other two last year.
Found stock accessory early bus windshield washer nozzles to go with our
pre-1964 bottles (Does anyone have directions on how these were installed?).
Four type 3 heater boxes which we use the insulation panels off of for our
type 1&amp;2 engines for more heat during the winter.  Two very nice bus gas
caps.  Two of the 1964-67 bus/K. Ghia intake rubber tubes that go from the
air cleaner to the carb.  Plus alot of other stuff, but nothing spectacular
this time.  Not like last fall at Puyallup when we picked up a mint used
yellow/gray Westie tent missing poles and the rear side panel for our 1962
Flip-seat Westie for $100.00, oh well.    Eric&amp;Barb
