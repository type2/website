They had different style latches (3) and some had no scoops, big scoops, or 
small scoops.

&gt; PS: Are all non-barndoor splitty doors and vent windows interchangeable?
vent windows are all pretty much the same...

doors themselves:
55-early 61 same
mid 61-early 64 same..
64-67 same

55-60 and 64-67 had through the glass latches for sliding windows, in
between they had the crappy laminated stuff.

take care,
