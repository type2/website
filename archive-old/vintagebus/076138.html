Subject: Re: [VB] bus on the highway

&gt;and if you are going 50mph and the trucker 70-80mph , well by ther time he
&gt;sees your lights its too late......

I almost got slammed into by a big dumptruck in my old Kombi. It was 
on the HWY...but during the day! He was going too fast and didn't 
realize I was going 53 MPH and was up on me quick. He couldn't change 
lanes 'cause the other one was occupied. I turned into the gravely 
shoulder as fast as I could and he barrelled past me. My young 
children were in the back seat. It sucked and really made me consider 
driving that slower speed on the HWY.
