Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Clyde Berg says their cover relieves at 130-140 psi.
My system has no pressure relief valve other than
the original dual relief valves supplied in the case.

Specs for those valves as stated in Without Guesswork
for the 1500cc engine list a load value for the 
oil pressure relief valve at 12.3-16 lbs. and for
the oil pressure control valve at 6.3-7.9 lbs. 
How do these cryptic numbers apply to an 
engine at operating oil pressure ?

The Berg oil pressure relief pump cover is threaded
3/8&quot;NPT, and is adapted to AN -8 ( dash 8, or 8/16&quot; )
1/2&quot;stainless braided teflon-core oil lines. and reduced 
back to 3/8&quot;NPT for oil return to the case.
So there is a restriction at both ends of the full-flow system.

&gt; Somebody on this list had a Berg full flow oil pump cover with the 
&gt; pressure relief valve built in give him a problem with low oil 
&gt; pressure.  It turned out that the relief valve had a bit of something 
&gt; stuck in it so that the valve was dumping oil back causing low oil 
&gt; pressure.  Does your system have a pressure relief valve?   Gary Gibson
