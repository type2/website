Subject: slash end bumper for trade
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a repro slash-end rear bumper from Wolfsburg
West 
It is just the blade, it has been drilled by WW for
overriders. It's bare metal, perfectly new. Came on my
67 bus and I want the correct type instead. So... I'd
like to trade it for a symmetrical-end rear. Either
repro in the same condition, or a very good original.
I'd trade plus cash for a perfect &amp; complete OEM one. 
Any takers?
Jason

PS: I wish I were going to Jerome. I'd get as many
raffle tickets as possible for that bus. That looks
like a sweet prize!!!
