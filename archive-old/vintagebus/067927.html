Subject: Re: [VB] $21K bus, anyone?

It gets even better.  Check out this news item that someone posted on
RAMVA last week.  How would you like to spend $38,500 on a bus:

from AUTOWEEK, September 30, 2002

MARKET

RM Auction at the DoubleTree Hotel
Monterey, Calif.
Aug. 16-17

1965 Volkswagen 21-Window Deluxe Transporter

Two-tone green with light-tan vinyl interior.  Optional third seat and 
walk-through front buckets.  California black plate, 1965 German oval 
plate.  Run in paint on rear bumper.  Radial-wide whites.  Large canvas 
sunroof.  Highly polished trim, good paint, very nice panel fits. 
Period luggage rack.  A professionally restored microbus that shows very 
well

Sold at $38,500

While this is a top price, and deserved by this bus, more interesting is 
the number of times weve watched it cross the block.  At the June 2001 
Barrett-Jackson/Petersen Auction, it went unsold at a declared high bid 
of $29,000.  Of course, high bids that dont result in sales are often 
as much a product of an auctioneers wishful thinking as of the bidding 
of a living, breathing human being.  A year later, at the same auction, 
it sold for $24,480.  Just two months later, having been brilliantly 
detailed and with a luggage rack added, RM got $38,500 for it, a 
profitbefore commissions are subtractedof more than 14,000.  The savvy 
buyer had faith he could hit it out of the park when it was put next to 
the million-dollar Ferraris in Monterey.  And in case of microbus 
arbitrage, he was right.  KEITH MARTIN

&gt; Wow!  It said that puppy sold for $21K at the Scottsdale BJ auction.  I saw
&gt; that bus and I would not have thought it was worth even $10K!!
