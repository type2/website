Subject: Re: [VB] Are they still available?

Hi,

In the example clipped below, the long number is the wolfgang stock
number. The next sets of numbers are the size the adaptor adapts, in
this case a 5 lug size 112 to a 5 lug 130. The codes before the price
are the vehicle types it applies to, in this case a type 2 1971 and
up.

Hope to see you at Bug o Rama. Where are you coming from?

John

      Is there anyone that happens to know what I am
 asking about, and be able to tell me how to decipher
 the results?  Thank you.  I would like to enter my
 ride into the Bug-o-rama show in Sacramento by next
 show season.  Thanks again for reading, and hope to
 keep the list updated on my progress.
