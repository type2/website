Subject: Staying warm

It's winter and it's not really all that warm.  My stock heater blasts an 
amazing volume of air, and it actually doesn't take all that long for it to 
warm up.  But the bus is still drafty.   And the over head air vent doesn't 
seal up all the way, so it whistles and lets cold air in.

While I'm ordering and waiting for the replacement seals, I taped up the 
overhead air vent inlet.   Used that green tape that is more like scotch 
tape, so it won't take the paint off when I take the tape off.  I have seen 
duct tape peel paint off.

Bus is a lot warmer and quieter now.
