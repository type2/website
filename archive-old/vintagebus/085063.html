Subject: sump stud repair redux...

...or, 6mm all-thread anybody?

got my 6x31mm studs from a/c_dot_net today; sadly, thay all have either 
the little 'ball' in the middle, or a threadless space there.  so 
they won't work to repair my loose sump plate stud. what i want to do 
is put a doubled nut INSIDE the case, so i need a longer-than-stock 
stud i can screw straight THROUGH the case from the inside.

so i guess i need to find either 6mm all-thread, or a longish 6mm 
bolt that i can cut the head off of.

just a heads-up for those thinking along my original lines... eric 
sez all studs longer than stock will have the interruption in the 
middle.  wish their web page said that!
