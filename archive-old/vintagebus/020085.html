Subject: 65 Samba, Few parts needed.
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Here are the last few parts i need to find.  Can
anyone help?

1.  Gas reserve valve lever arm.  
2.  Splash pan rubber edge seals (rear bumper)
3.  SWF Safari Wiper shaft disengaugers (SP?) (65-57)
4.  Front seat deck mat plug's. 
      (These are the plugs that snap into the seat
deck below the front seats and come up thru the grey
deck cover and cover the hole in the grey mat.  WCM
sells the small ones for but not the larger ones. 
They are about 2&quot; diameter.  I think the seats may
rest on these too.)
5.  12V dash clock
6.  Westfalia Tow Bar
7.  spare tire hump cover aluminum trim
8.  Afordable pair of German round outer rear view.
mirrors
9.  Pair of original sun visors. [TMI are :(  Note
very happy with them]

If anyone can help i would apreciate it.

Thanks
