Hello all!

The Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project is proud to announce the
newest addition to our on-line library: the 1954 Type II parts manual!
Over 500 pages of every single piece that goes into a Barndoor, with
text in English, German, and French!  Also, all illustrations that were
originally in color are presented in color.

Big thanks to Thom Fitzpatrick for doing the hard part of scanning this
manual!  It is available online as individual pages or in archive files
of all the pages for each section.  PDFs are forthcoming but not yet
available.

Get this and other fine documentation now at:

http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm 

To learn more about the OACDP, see http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/aboutdoc.htm .

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
