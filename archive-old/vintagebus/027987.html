&gt; I found another set for sale, however.  They have been bead blasted.
My question is: Since they are now totally stripped, how do I polish them to
a bright shiny luster? Can I do it with my die grinder and polishing wheel?&lt;

No die grinding!  All elbow grease and a little bit of a buffing wheel.  I hope you have about 6-8 hours per wheel and some strong arms.

Check out this link and scroll down to the &quot;exterior&quot; section: http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/911/911tech_articles.htm

I am no help on knowing how exactly to get the Fuchs on the bus either...  I do know it is a PITA and $$$.

Also I do not think the center caps will fit on the bus / Fuchs combination without more trimming of the axle stubs.  Most of the custom busses I have seen do not even bother with center caps and it looks crappy.  Good center caps are expensive if your set did not come with them, I think about $100 each with the Porsche crest.  I have no idea why they are so darn expensive, ridiculous I think.

I think 15x6 wheels may fit inside the bus arches though.  They have a deep inside offset not outside.  I think if your have a &quot;J&quot; offset you will be fine, but don't quote me on that.  Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook should have the wheel offsets listed if you want to be sure.

Wolfsburg West used to have a kit to adapt the 911 brakes to the front axle which would give you the correct bolt pattern and drop spindles, but I cannot find it on their website and do not know if they still offer it.  This maybe this became too pricey for most of the VW crowd since a pair of &quot;S&quot; or &quot;A&quot; calipers alone can cost between $400-$600, you may get lucky though on a used set you will need to rebuild.     

The rear is easy to drop and Bus Boys or Wolfsburg can hook you up on this.  Basically it kills the reduction boxes.

Keep us posted on your progress!  I am very curious to see how it comes out since I have considered this myself in the future.  Right now I am thinking lazy and leaning toward BRM wheels though ;)  

Good Luck,
