   Dang good question. I have been in continuous possession (or is that possessed?) of at least one ACVW since 1972. Over the last few years, starting when my oldest young 'un decided she wanted a VW Bug for her first car, I've somehow managed to end up with six of the endearing beasties. Granted, at the moment only two are running, '69 Bug, '77 Baja (daughter's ride). My '78 Westy is still undergoing various surgical procedures and our '73 (owned since '74) is up on jack stands at my friend's barn awaiting a much deserved overhaul after 246,000 miles.

   When my daughter expressed an interest I found the '69 and we started tearing in to it, replacing stuff etc. When that project was about half complete I stumbled across a &quot;smurf blue&quot; '77 Baja with a killer 2180, dual carbed beast of an engine in it. Running and tagged and ready to go and it was priced right. Took my daughter out for a spin and she said, &quot;Love the car, hate the engine...&quot; or something like that.

   Sigh.

   Contacted a friend of a friend and bought a supposedly good '70 Bug for the engine. Turned out to be a bad deal, but I was stuck with it as I'm not prone to violence. Motor was shot. My friend made the deal even by repossessing enough tools and stuff from his now former friend to even up my loss.

   Not two days later another friend told me about a guy who had a good running '65 with a 1500 SP in it and a &quot;bad tranny&quot;. Bought it for $275. Pulled the engine, put it in the Baja and she happily motored through her senior year of high school. Then she was accepted to a college in New Mexico. She will need more power for those mountains and 75mph interstates out there, I thought, sooo....

   We then proceeded to build a 1600 DP for her car. From the crank to the last screw in the tin she was right with me, getting greasy, breaking nails without complaint, cleaning parts, putting new ones in until we had a ready to run engine. Got it in a couple weeks before she headed off to college. Now, three years later, it's still terrorizing New Mexico jackrabbits. And she works on her own car, tune ups, valve adjustments etc.

   Meanwhile, another friends impending divorce forced him to liquidate some assets and I picked up the '78 Westy for $600. I've bought a ton of stuff from Ron to fix up seals, bodywork etc. as I get the time (a real hard to get commodity recently).

   And I'm still crossing my fingers on a back channel deal for a '69 Westy. Maybe a Ghia to put the 2180 in. I dunno.

   My wife thinks I'm nuts, but she still loves me.

&gt;  Thing is, it's a great bus and I want to keep it, so how do I explain the air-cooled phenomenon to my wife when she asks, and i quote, &quot;Why do you need three??&quot;  I'm sure we all here can understand why I would want one split window, one bay window, and one Type 1. Really, I guess it's a good question, why do I need three?? It seems obvious to me, but How do I explain it?? Anybody else been in this situation?!?!?!?
