Hell, 

Spent $500 for a rust bucket bus + the money to get the thing home just for the Westfalia interior.  I looked for 3 years trying to find the parts...no luck.  I'm hoping to recoup some of the cost when I part the thing out and keep the interior.  In the mean time I got it running and drive it around...gives me motivation for finishing the real project.

You can get ignition stuff any day of the week, and a deck lid every
other week.  The camper stuff comes up once in a blue moon.

You made the right decision.
