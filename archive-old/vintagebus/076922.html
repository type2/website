Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

 I suspect than Jake hasn't pulled a RGBox apart and looked at the RGears.   they are much sturdier than the gears in the tranny center section.  
 
 they do reduce the gearing, of course, which is why they are called reduction gears.  and which is why sometimes people who put big motors in the buses remove the RGBs to make the gearing higher.   
Then put in a 3.88 r/p with a .77 4th so you can cruise at 80mph and not wind it out, still hear the stereo.   
If you have enough motor for that gearing.

 &gt; Well, I was talking to Jake Raby at a show a few months ago, telling him
 &gt; about putting a type 4 in my bus; and he said that I would need to do
 &gt; something about the redux boxes because the gears aren't all that strong and
 &gt; will shatter with all the torque that a type 4 engine has.
