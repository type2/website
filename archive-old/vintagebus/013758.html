&gt; I'm looking for some input from the list on this
&gt; one.

&lt;BIG SNIP&gt;

. What I'm concerned with is
&gt; the transaxle.
&gt; The fire was hot enough to melt the brake hoses,
&gt; axle boots, etc.
&gt; Do you think with the same good cleaning, seal
&gt; change and brake
&gt; parts replacement it'll be useable

Well Im no expert, but have torched a couple of T1s...
If the fire wasnt hot enough to set the case on fire,
Id put ALL new seals &amp; gaskets in it (hub to hub),
brake cylindars, brake lines(rubber&amp; metal), shoes,
turn drums(they CAN warp).
Im wondering what the wiring looks like....
