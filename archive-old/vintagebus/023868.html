Subject: George's Summer Vacation (0/4)

Hello Volks!

Here it is!  4500 miles of exciting VW bus travel throughout the West
and Midwest regions of the US.  Come with us to visit California,
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Swelter in the South Dakota sun! 
Freeze in the Arizona mountains!  Blow two tires in one day!  Fun for
everyone!

This account is long (perhaps too long!) so I have split it into four
pieces.  You might want to have some maps handy as you read.

I'm posting this announcement to the Vintagebus list, but the actual
trip report will not go there (after all, we did drive a baywindow!)
If Vintagebus volk wish to read it, it can be had from the type2_dot_com
site.

Enjoy!
