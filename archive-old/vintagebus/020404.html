Thanks All  Just what I wanted.....some inside info on
what to look for and what to ask for when getting that
&quot;New&quot; engine for my bus.....Hey come to think of it no
one said a word about going electric....with a very
long extension cord I guess.Electric sounds good but
my guess is much to much money and short range for
serious road time.I did read about some guys that were
using old oil from the fast food places that they
could get for free out back...to run their Franken-Bus
creation...I'll look for that link....Thanks
Again...Mark 67 Deluxe 13 window
