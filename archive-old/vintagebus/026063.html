&gt; Hello All....
&gt;  Is there a way to tighten up the front door window
&gt; latches so they dont rattle? One rattled pretty good

There is a spring inside the mechanism that keeps the thing in the
&quot;locked&quot; position when you are not holding the two pieces together to
slide the window.. you can use the spring from a german pen if you don't
have the original....ok, any old retractable nib pen will work....
