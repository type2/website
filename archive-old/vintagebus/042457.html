hi all,

Im going after this thing like a dog after a nice juicy bone...

Anyway, last night i readjusted the brakes and the pedal travel calmed
down quite a bit.  Turns out i had the front ones quite loose... but now
its fix-fix :)

I double checked the MC pushrod clearance and it looks to be about 1mm as
per factory spec, so the problem wasn't there.

I took my cordless drill with wirebrush attachment and a scraper to the
cab floor in preparation for the POR15 treatment.

The highlight of the night though was undoing the gas pedal hack with a
better hack.  All hardware store parts baybee...

What i did was this:

Went to home depot with my good used gas pedal... got some steel rod that
fit through the hole (1/4.)

Looked around for some steel tubing that would fit tightly around the
steel rod to weld to what was left of the tab on the floor.  Couldnt find
a darned thing that would fit so i started thinking of using a gate hinge
or something.  Then it dawned on me that that hollow threaded lamp tubing
might be just the ticket (the stuff that connects your bulb socket to the
lamp.. yu've all seen it, also used for hoover &quot;bulkhead fitting&quot;)

I got home and hacked a piece that fit, ground off the nickel plating
where i was going to weld, used vise grips to put it in place, and welded
it to what was left of that tab on the floor.  Not having a mig i used my
smallest gas welding tip and a nice thin coathanger.  5 minutes later i
have an attachment point for my gas pedal.  hacked a proper length of 1/4
rod to drive through there, and all i need to do now is install the parts
and cover the hole the PO made for the roller arm style pedal he had in
there...

I'll take a picture and post it on the web, i just dont have a digital
camera.  Best thing about this hack is no-one will se it unless they can
fit their head between the gas pedal and the kick panel (not bloody
likely.) and its probably stronger than OG system.  Plus since i welded to
what was left of the tab to secure the original hinge, i can drill out two
spotwelds and put in the right thing if i ever run into a good one.  But,
i have a feeling this will serve me just fine. (As long as my welds hold,
heh)

take care,

Steve
