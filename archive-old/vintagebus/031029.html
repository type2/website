Subject: Poptop Deluxe

I was wondering if anyone has seen a Pop top 15 window??
Silly question but There is a .gif on The Westfalia Owners Web Site
http://www.westfalia_dot_org/
That sure looks like a Camper / deluxe

I was thinking that I could do that to my Deluxe... 
Or,,I could sell it and buy a early westy..
