Subject: Missed You Guys!

Computer has been dead for the last few months!

Anyway, found a guy with 2 crew cabs for sale as a
pair.  Details:

62 - has 1975 registration tags, parked in a barn
since.  Some roof rust, rear fenders cut, missing
seats and motor/trans.  Pretty straight though. 
Purchased from an old German guy with a repair
business in the LA area.  Has not moved from his
'barn' since he drove it in 23 years ago.

61 - great running gear, but pretty ugly.  Front
end needs bodywork, but makes a perfect donor car
for the other one.  Has early 2-piece gates, but
hinges have been repaired by a hack.

$2750 takes the pair.
