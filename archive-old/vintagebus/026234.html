&gt; my local &quot;vintage&quot; shop said noone repops the rear (or any of the others for that matter) metal brake lines for my 57. Anyone know of a good source? What about the 'T' fitting on the rear?
&gt;
Hey Wade,
When I broke one of my rears (don't ask), I bought one at Autozone.  It is not 100% correct-looking, the threaded ends are longer.

I believe Wolfsburg West has the lines in their catalog, maybe Ronnie, too?  I know I have a front-to-rear line I got from Ronnie.

I've never heard of a metal line clogging up, only breaking.  I've had clogs in the past, it was always collapsed rubber lines.
