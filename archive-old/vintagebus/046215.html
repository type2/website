This Firday-Sunday is the Annual Spring Campout at Dillon Beach in CA. Rain or
Shine (the latest weather report calls for shine).  Camping per bus per night
is $13.00, day use is $5.00.  All Type 2's are welcome!  	
From Petaluma take East Washington St/Bodega Ave west for 8 miles.  Turn left
onto Tomales Rd. follow to Highway 1.  Turn right.  In the town of Tomales,
make a left onto Dillon Beach Rd.  Four miles later, in Dillon Beach, follow
the county road until it ends and you are at the Lawson's Landing Campground.
We hope to see you there.  The Split Bus Club is a chapter of NEATO.
