&gt;Subject: Richard Kurtz, Former list &amp; Club contributor

&gt;I am emailing you folks to inform you that a past list contributor has
&gt;passed away from cancer last weekend.
&gt;Way back when the Vanagon list was the one place to get VW Bus
&gt;listserv-type information, Richard began collecting Bob Hoover's posts
&gt;and organizing them so folks could easily access them on the net.
&gt;Richard volunteered a lot of his time and programming expertise to help
&gt;many folks out with VW questions and information, never expecting
&gt;anything in return.  He also hosted the the original Vintage VW Club of
&gt;America web site prior to Ernie Otter becoming web master, helping the
&gt;VVWCA grow its membership greatly with online membership forms back in
&gt;1994(?).   I know that many &quot;old-timers&quot; out there may recall
&gt;correspondence with Richard.  The archives reflect his work on the
&gt;&quot;Hoover Sermons&quot; and his dedication to his vehicular VW interests.  If
&gt;you list administrators care to share this information with your lists,
&gt;I would appreciate it.  There is a charity fund that Richard was
&gt;involved with that is accepting contributions in his name.  E-mail me
&gt;for more information if needed.  He also may have a few Type II's and a
&gt;VW Thing at his acreage near Jacksonville, Florida that his widow may be
&gt;selling in the future. Again, e-mail me for more information if
&gt;needed.   Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Jon Christensen, former VVWCA Membership Coordinator
