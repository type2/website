&gt; He claims they dont buy new cars, they just keep the old ones runnin.
&gt; -wade-

They do keep the old ones running....any way they can it seems.  They also
&quot;bless&quot; their cars... my bus is blessed by Mohamed Basheer.  I have this
little laminated card that he gave to the previous bus owner that says &quot;God
bless this automobile.  This is God's car. God's hand is at the wheel.  God's
law of order and right adjustment is manifest in all its mechanism.  God's
wisdom inspires in the driver alertness, good judgement, and quick decision.
God's patience gives him temperance and courtesy&quot;  Then it gives the guys name
and his taxi no. and his guest house or something....

I talked to a guy from South Africa that was well travelled when he was over
here visiting a friend.... seems they drive some real hoopties over there with
vice grips for &quot;steering wheels&quot; and 20 people hanging off of a compact-sized
car...

FWIW...

Isaiah
