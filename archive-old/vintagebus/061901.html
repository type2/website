That's Jay, he used to be on here but moving and a nasty computer virus
have unsubscribed him for awhile.

I think they were essentially using tempera paints. They will come right
off of a shiny paint job with a hose and rag. If your paint is oxidized, it
might stick a bit. Or, if you let it bake in the Yuma sun for a couple of
weeks without washing (which Jay DID) then...you're looking at a permanent
paint job!

I think you were more interested in the permanent solution. You could look
into acrylic based paints, just probably want to have the girls wash their
hands right afterwards. If you wanted to go nuts, let them paint the whole
thing, then get it clear-coated! That would be kind cool, actually!

Beside, nothing you do to a post 67 bus is truly sacreligious... :)
