I sell stereos for a living, and along with Custom Auto Sound, that's who we send folks to for custom installations in classic cars.

&gt; Someone had asked about onformation about a company that makes vintage stereo

&gt; cable. http://customautosound_dot_com/Speakers.htm
&gt; Looks like they primarily do stuff with american hotrods and the other heavy 
&gt; metal cars. I have written them about a product that I found interesting 
&gt; enough to actually consider putting in my 67 Westy. Its a faceplate that 
&gt; folds horizontally flat and controls the cd jukebox by remote controls. So I 
&gt; thought, place this under my parcel tray, hide the cd jukebox and keep my 
&gt; original stock radio in the dash. Now where to hide the speakers.
&gt; 
&gt; Will find out more and pass it along.
