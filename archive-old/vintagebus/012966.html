&gt;Are you referring to Berg's technique of linking the two oil grooves on the
&gt;lifters to better maintain oil pressure through the valve train?  Grooving
&gt;lifter bores is only going to result in oil pressure losses, while grooving
&gt;guides will contribute to oil burning (especially if your ring seal is
&gt;really good)..

 And some other bad mouth about titanium . . :-)

 Look at the titanium thing first . . titanium really shines in
corrosive atmospheres . . means you/ve burnt everything else up
before you ever even tried titanium . . it's expensive . .

 Used in jet turbine blades . . rocket motors . .

 Good for heat, corrosives, and shock loads . . also light weight

 The only civilian application I've ever had was the shutters in 
&quot;Kleig&quot; lights . . the spot lights in theaters . .

 The light puts out so much heat, it burns a steel shutter (iris)
almost imediately . .

 In the space industry I use it to replace steel  . .

 So while there are many types of stainless, I doubt if a stainless
valve would last longer than a titanium under similar conditions.

 The basic alloy of both would still be &quot;steel&quot; . . 

 On the bearing thing . . no I wasn't refering to any racing 
book . .

 If you go look in any engineering manual, the plain journal bearing
is only one of some ten types shown in illustration . .

 I'll try an illustration with the words :-)

 Take your tubular journal bearing with a plain shaft running 
thru it . . now on the inside cut a pocket of all  the bearing
surface except for a strip around the edges . .

 If you have removed 80% of the material in contact with the shaft
and maintained the oil-tight edges, you will hold oil pressure and
reduce bearing friction by that 80% . . .

 It's also real plain that I've reduced the load-bearing capacity
by that 80% . . .

 Which brings me to James last cry of rebellion . . :-)

&quot;it will wear out fast . . &quot;  &quot;it will leak&quot; .  !

 You want tens on the track or you just come down to ogle the 
girls . .?

 You know as well as I do the winner has the most pit crew and
the most parts to replace with . .

 About Berg . . he did a lot of testing and it is shown in his
writings . . he also states opinions and may state he does this
a certain way . . 

 You can't fault data that came off the dyno of a hundred engines.

 Then there are his opinions and way of doing things . .
He was a racer . . and it's good to listen to what he says . .
But not all his stuff will work in my application . .

 He never said it would . . :-)
