I did it again.

The ad said: 61 factory camper. Runs well. needs brake work and paint. 800.00
Well...... it is only a 80 mile trip, what the hell.

Could not find a piece of metal in the thing that had not rusted through. The
frame was about the break. NO floors front or back. Had a cool rocker on the
right, made from carved wood :-) . 1600 bug engine and 5 extra carbs inside.
&quot;Oh yea, did I tell you on the phone that there is no ignition switch? It must
run strong as we drove it here with the emergency brake locked up!&quot;

Must have been an American conversion. The rear cabinets were dark brown wood
grain with metal trim -- never seen that before. Rest of the insides trashed.
It did have some cool looking interior lamps with shades that seemed intact.
What model is this??
