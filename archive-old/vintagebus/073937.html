&gt; Is it too difficult to install heater boxes with the engine in?  Just 
&gt; wondering before I try it and may save more time pulling my motor. 

Hi Bart,
Can be done, the heater box flex tubes have to be flexed out of the way.  
Really though it is alot easier and you might as well pull out the engine and 
check everthing out in the front of the engine and tranny wise.
