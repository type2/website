&gt;&gt;STill haven't got the fronts off, guess it'll be a while.  I do have at
least one extra curvy thing for the rear shock.  Did you rebuild or replace
yours, and do you know about getting seals for the arm, cause after after I
put them in  well I drove it around yeasterday morning and then it dripped
from thearms jack oil plink plink on the garage floor POS.
&gt;&gt;
I have been told that the arm can be removed and the bushing replaced from a
fellow Barndoor owner but have not seen it done with my own eyes or done it
myself.  I personally have 2 replacement lever shocks to mount on my Bus.  I
also have the 2 originals in perfect working order except the original owner
cut off the arms midway.  Doh!

I actually only need 2 of the curvy things...  I have 2.

&gt;&gt;
re the change of part number systems I figured that they changed late 53 as
my 6/53 made bus has the old style, while I have seen early 54s with the
late style system.  So I am surprised you 55 has the 29.xx style.  go
figure.
&gt;&gt;
I'll check my Bus out if there is interest, what parts should I look at?  I
know the rear cargo door latch and the rear decklid latch have 29A #s.  The
cargo door handle is 29A too.

It wouldn't surprise me if some parts were overproduced and thus extended
29A usage into early '55.
