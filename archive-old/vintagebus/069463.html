Subject: Re: [VB] Type lV motor problem

I suggest joining the type2 mailing list, which focuses on 68-82 box shaped 
type 2s.  This list is for the 67 and earlier type 2s, which tend to have the 
upright motor, a whole nother ball of wax.

I used to have a bus with the same motor as yours.   I think I had that 
problem when the air box connection came loose.   The FI plug to the air box, 
to be precise.  On the right front side of the engine compartmet.    Or maybe 
the flapper in air box got stuck.    the air box is the thingy the air filter 
goes into, and there is a connection to it for the FI brain.  That engine 
gave many tens of thousands of miles of use with just the regular tune up.  
Double check all your tubes to make sure you don't have an air leak anywhere, 
and that all are hooked up correctly.
hm, or was it the dual relay? it's been so long.

&lt;&lt; I have a 77 Type II with a 2.L Fuel-injected motor that I recently rebuilt.
 After installing the motor, it idles fine, but when pushing on the
 accelerator, the motor slowly dies.  I'm fairly confident that I put
 everything back correctly, however, there is that &quot;one thing&quot; that I might 
not
 have paid attention to.  Has anyone else had this problem in the past?....
 Thanks guys (and gals). Steve
