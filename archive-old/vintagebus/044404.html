Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Kombi...engine trouble

Just got done with my bus. I pulled the carb and took it apart. I 
blew threw all the jets and passages. What I would call the main jet 
seems like it might have been clogged a little. When i put it all 
back together and installed it, the engine ran good. In fact, my 
engine now seems to have more power and be running like it did a few 
hundred miles back. The problem wasn't really apparant until today 
when it wouldn't run right at all. So I guess it was already there, 
just got more extreme all of a sudden today.

Time for bed.
