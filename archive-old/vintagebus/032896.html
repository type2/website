&lt;&lt; Maybe Dan's talents would be more rewarded if he broke into something
 different.  How about westfalia stuff?  Seems someone is always looking
 for poles and/or mounts.  I for one would buy a repro westy setup to
 hang on the panel.  I think a tent is a MAJOR value-add to  a bus. &gt;&gt;

Thanks for the input.  Safari's were just one of many ideas.  My thoughts 
were about making some that didn't leak but that would necessitate a design 
change.  I was just curious as to how deep the &quot;Vintage Nazi&quot; blood ran and 
what the tolerance is to a variance from stock appearance.  

As far as the tents...funny you should mention that.  My neighbor is a 
seamstress who makes most of her money from making wedding dresses.  Surely 
tents are easier to make than wedding dresses.  We have been talking about 
doing some VW tent stuff.  We are checking into the cost of industrial 
machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent &quot;have&quot; 
to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent that 
is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with 
floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.

Also, looks like I am going to sell my '53.  In away I kind of hate to, I 
really like it.  But bottom line is it rides like a John Deere tractor which 
all but rules it out for long distance trips which is what I enjoy most about 
my VW's...that and of course other financial priorities.  I have the Binz for 
long trips and can't really justify having a BD just for the around town 
stuff.

Info on the '53 in next message.
