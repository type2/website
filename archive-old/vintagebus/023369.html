&lt;&lt; I was thinking of doing this too.  Do you need to be concerned with RPM

 keeping the boxes?&gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
Not unless you are thinking of doing over 150 MPH with a stock geared bus 
tranny!  
;-)

 &lt; &gt;&gt;

The only thing we have heard of clearance problems is one has to convert to 
upright to keep the engine compartment uncut and find a FW that will fit the 
smaller inner diameter tranny bellhousing.  The first is alot of work 
fabricating/modifying, but not anywhere near impossible.  The second is easy, 
apparently there was a type 4 FW that fits just fine in the earlier tranny.  
FI for any ACVW engine over 1700cc seems to be a must for power/torque to 
properly work all the way through the RPM range of the engine.  Plus the 
added MPG savings pays off the cost of the about $1,500.00 for new fuel 
injection system in much less than 40,000 miles of driving.   Eric&amp;Barb
