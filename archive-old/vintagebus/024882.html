&gt; I would probably have to say bench would be better for snuggling close with
&gt; your wife or girlfriend but I'm buying a walkthrough and I would have to say
&gt; it seems more practical

Having done many miles in both versions, and having just completed 8k in
a bench, I vote for bench. Walkthru is convenient for getting back and
forth, but being 6'2&quot; tall, the passenger seat in a walkthru is very
uncomfortable. You are pressed right up against the passenger door.

My wife likes to keep a little office of a road trip log, pens, pencils,
bribe money, cameras, etc next to her on the bench. She hates the
walkthru because it not only lacks this space, but feels to her as
though it is not as secure. (?)

She is short, so the leg room is no problem. In fact, she keeps a small
cooler up front with her too, so no chance of getting kicked in the head
while she crawls back to make sandwiches.

I would trade my 67 walkthru westy for a compatible 67 westy bench in a
heartbeat.
VanBondo? They're pretty close. :)
