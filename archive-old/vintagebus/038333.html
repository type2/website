&gt;Hi Joe, Eric &amp; other volks,

Thanks for correcting my erroneous suggestion. For any novices out there, please keep in mind that all of us do our best, but we're all human--folks like me have less experience but want to help; folks like &quot;Eric &amp; Barb&quot; have more experience and also want to help. As with doctors, it's always important to wait for those second opinions...because you're the one who will suffer if you dive headfirst into the first snakeoil remedy that comes along.

Hey, at least I was on the right track. ;)

Really, Thanks! Joe
