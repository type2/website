Subject: RE: [VB] Anyone know of any serious rat look buses?

Hey Andy,

I found that step on ebay a bit ago.  Thanks to the repops now being
made, the old vintage ones are once again semi affordable.  I have 1 NOS
og ellipse shaped one that will go on the passenger side of the double
cab (to help the nice ladies get it ;-) ) and then I found the oval one
pictured on the fire bus... but still, just one on the pass. side.  I
think I paid 40 or so for the oval one and around 100 for the nos one
for the dc.

I think the last crusty pair I saw sell, they were half the price as of
one year ago... again, thanks to the repops to take the attention of the
originals.

David



Andy asked:
&lt;Snip&gt;By the way, David, where could I get a set of those
steps?
They look cool &amp; could be just the thing.
