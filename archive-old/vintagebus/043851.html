Subject: Midwest Hardcore Campout this weekend.
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.21.0105241001280.2695-100000_at_westfailure_dot_net&gt;

hi all,

Just a reminder that the campout is this weekend.  Why is it called
hardcore? No facilities, no services, way off the beaten path.  There will
be no RV'ers here with satellite dishes &amp; AC, knowhutimean, heh.

It will be near Licking, MO. Directions and pictures of the site are
located at 

http://westfailure_dot_org/campout.php

The earliest person will be there around 3 in the afternoon or so and will
be hanging up signs to help people find it. The weather is looking great
as well, if you can believe weathermen. 65-75 degrees all weekend, partly
cloudy.

I am hoping to acquire a large pile of firewood so we can have a HUGE fire
circle saturday night, if you want to bring firewood, please do, all
contributions gladly accepted.

Hope to see you there,

Steve

p.s. The field is sooo big that the Drum lovers and Drum haters can
coexist peacefully. No worries about loosing sleep from drums. Also,
though this is a bus/vgon/eurovan campout, other VW's and people just
interested in VW busses are welcome.
