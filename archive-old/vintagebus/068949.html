Hi Dave,
Cool!  Make sure to cut off the tailpipe tip and weld on an extension well 
out to the side of the rear corner of the bus to prevent a massive buildup of 
carbon monoxide behind your bus that can easily get into the interior and gas 
you and your passengers to death or at least to brain damage.
