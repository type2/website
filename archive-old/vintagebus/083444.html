Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring Harness

From Jim Reid:

I have recently purchased a 65 Splitty - looking for information on wiring
harnesses - either to make my own or purchase one, not sure which is best -
Also wondering about changing out the fuse box to a more updated one.  Any suggestions, experiences or
comments would be appreciated.  The bus has already converted to 12V and the gas gauge is inop.  Thanks!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The gas gauge is probably still 6V, but it still will work fine on 12V.
The sender works on 6V to 24V range.
The sender regulates ground to the gauge by resistance. Usually in the 0 to 90 ohm range.
Do you have 12V going to the + side of the gauge? The + side is the terminal towards the speedometer. It
should be black.

Nothing wrong with a late split fuse box. Why would you want to replace it?

Wiring Works makes the best [and only? that I know of] replacement harness.
