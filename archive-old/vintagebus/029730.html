There was a guy at Pomona with a 36hp engine at his house.  He said it was
freshly rebuilt with new pistons, cylinders, rings, etc..  Turn key complete
according to him.  It sounded like a '59 engine.

It was $650.

Email me if you are interested, I have his phone #.

It was in the LA area.  I seriously doubt he would ship.
