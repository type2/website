Hi NQ,
Not a good idea to have the above parts in such condition which will suck in 
both hot air from below the bus and exhaust gases from the muffler!  Also 
causing such a vaccum will make it alot harder for the engine to breath.  
Best to get rid of the deep sump at least during the winter and remount it 
during the summer if you insist on having it.    Eric&amp;Barb
