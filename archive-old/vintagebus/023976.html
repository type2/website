&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt; Good point, but the problem that can also happen is that the heads and/or case
&gt; where the cylinders can have been flycut to improve the squareness and sealing
&gt; of these areas.  Thusly the width of the entire engine can go the opposite way
&gt; towards being too short for the exaust system to fit in extereme instances.
&gt; For stock engines the pistons should come up to about .070&quot; from the top of
&gt; the cylinders.  If short there then you should shim under the cylinders.  If
&gt; you have this measurement and the heads are too small cc to bring the CR down
&gt; to about 7:1 then you might want add up to about .040&quot; more at the most to the
&gt; shims under each side of the cylinders,

Barb and Eric,

I agree with you 100%...In my post I was just replying to the lowering of
compression via shims and NOT flycutting heads or cleaning up the cylinders seats
on the case, that was not brought up in this thread....Of course logic states you
must use shims to put your engine back into original geometry if you fly cut or
deck the case...which I myslef do if required....Calculating the CR and correct
Deck height was alittle more complex then this original post asked about....One
should always check his/her motors deck height, as well as CC ing your heads to
correctly set your CR.
