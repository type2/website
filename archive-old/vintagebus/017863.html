&gt; So, what are you going to do, Thom?  

Well, last night I removed all of the little set-bolts, boths sides and the middle.

The driver's side moves fine, the passenger side won't.

I greased everything  up - went thru 1 1/2 tubes of grease.

I tried removing the trailing arm, no joy.  Won't budge.  Didn't try removing
the driver's one yet.  Can you remove the one side and then pound thru
the opposite side?

I tried heating it with a torch, didn't make any difference.

&gt; If your trailing arms break, I might have a spare set of barndoor ones, but I 
&gt; could be wrong.  Need to look at my spindle pile as the upper left king pin 
&gt; bushing area is worn on my 65, and getting annoying, time to see if I have a 
&gt; decent used left 64-67 spindle.

I imagine LHD and RHD trailing arms are the same.

&gt; so, I guess you might have to find that wrong hand drive BD n the pick and 
&gt; pull,?

Missed it!  When I got to the junkyard yesterday, Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa were
loading it on a trailer...
