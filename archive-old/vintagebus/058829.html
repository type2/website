Subject: RE: [VB] Parts made overseas.  Looking for help

  Just look under Taiwan on the internet. There is a whole group of brokers
that handle small production runs of misc parts. Somewhere throughout my
junk I have a whole catalog on manufacturers overseas that make just about
anything. If I can find it I will p-mail you the info.

ronnie
ps. The racks and there pieces are being produced by 3 different companies
(one just copies the other) and a 3rd repo Westy rack will be hitting the
market soon!!

Subject: [VB] Parts made overseas. Looking for help


Does anyone have any experiance or contacts with any
overseas shops who reproduce some of our beloved Steel
VW bus parts?  Anyone know who is making (not selling)
the repro roof racks from China?

I have a non VW project i am working on and am looking
for some cheap ways to have some small lot parts made.
 Parts will require Steel turning, fabrication and
welding.

Thanks
Matthew
