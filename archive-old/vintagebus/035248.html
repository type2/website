&lt;&lt; I compromise: I put my filter on the suction side of the pump. &gt;&gt;

I figure I might as well keep the rust and crap out of my fuel pump, and put 
it on the suction side, but I run a long length of fuel hose, and tuck the 
filter out away from the engine in the left vent area.  This helps keep me 
from vaporlocking on those hot New Mexico summer days, because my filter is 
in the airflow to the engine.  Also, there's enough slack to raise the line 
high enough to change the filter with minimal gas spillage.  Additionally, I 
can get my engine completely out of the bus before having to disconnect the 
fuel hose.  I change my fuel hose so often, it's a joke at my local FLVWAPS, 
because I buy it almost every time I pull the engine.

On the safety note, NEVER use an incandescent drop light when you're working 
on the gas line under your bus.  Someone here in Albuquerque a while back 
lost not only their vehicle, but their life from a droplight caused fire!
