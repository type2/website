Subject: Flat 4 is Back

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Just to let everyone know that Flat 4 will be back in the U.S. shortly.  So
DON'T pay those crazy prices for the BRM's and the EMPI sprint stars that
everyone thinks are now worth a small fortune. The link is as follows:

I hope this helps some people out, and keeps them from paying too much on
eBarf.
