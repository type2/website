&lt;&lt;Everett asked:


&gt;white pinstiping was factory-correct.  Is this true?

&gt;I've never noticed a pinstriping line on the original paint Kombis I've

&gt;seen.  On Standards and Deluxes, yes.

&gt;

My original Dove Blue South African-assembled 57 Kombi has a white pinstripe

a little above the waistline. Another dove blue 57 Kombi I know of also has

this hand-painted pinstripe.


I also know of a 58 Standard in two-tone green/khaki (I don't know what the

factory colours are called) where there are two hand-painted pinstripes,

with light green pinstripe on the dark green section, and dark green

striping on the light green paint below.
