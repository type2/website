Subject: More paint and paint gun Q's

Went to another paint store today to try and find a better/cheaper place
to get my supplies.

First paint:  I found a source for Acrylic Enamil.  However, after
talking with the owner of the store decided that Acrylic Eurithane will
be a better produce to shoot.  I have looked at 3 different brands of
paint.
1.  PPG.  I have shot this brand before.  It is about $330/Gal for
Sealing Wax Red (SWR)  They have the exact L codes
2. Du-Pont.  I have not shot this brand.  It is aobut $315/Gal for SWR.
They do not have the right L codes though.
3. Glasso.  Have not used, but is the VW factory brand.  $345/Gal.  They
have the exact L codes.

All are Acrylic Eurithane.  Has anyone out there shot any of these?  Any
input on results or quality of product.  Right now i am apt to go with
Glasso.  I may pay an extra $50, but i know that i will get the right
colors.

Paint Gun's:  After talking to a few shop's, i am under the impresion
that i need not spend boo-coo bucks for a name brand HVLP gun.  I know
that i am going to use a top load unit.  I started looking at the $300
type gun's, but they are telling me that a $150 knock-off will give me
the same quality.  The qualified that with by saying that i am not going
to make my living with it.  for the amout of time i will use it, they
told me to save my money.  Any input on this out there?  Right now i am
looking at a SATA knock-off.

That is the delema.  what should i do?  any input from you all would be
apreciated.  especially from those of you who have paint your own car's.

Matthew
