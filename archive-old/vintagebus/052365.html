Subject: Re: [VB] Sick tranny questions

Hi Pete,
If your clutch pedal has the same back pressure when you depress it, then it 
sounds like you have an oiled up clutch disc.  If the clutch pedal has less 
back pressure then it could be a broken clutch arm or flipped off throw out 
bearing.  We have found it is not such a good idea to depress the clutch 
pedal for start ups.  Doing this puts a lot pressure on the #1 main bearing 
when it has no oil pressure.  Which increases wear on the trust side of this 
bearing slowly making it nessasary to use thicker and thicker FW shims till 
one can no longer shim it anymore!
  As far as going to a freeway flier tranny you should tach the tranny you 
have now in there and then compare it to the freeway flier.  With same 
205/75R15s tires on all four rims we get 58 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM in fourth gear.  
If you have a bug or perhaps a type 3 stocked geared tranny 3,000 RPM in 
fourth should be at 60 MPH.  
  For us going from a 4.375 R&amp;P 1960-63 tranny that got 47MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM to 
the freeway flier tranny was like just getting a fifth gear tranny without 
all the extra cost.  Especially since the top of third gear _at_ 3,000 RPM is 
44MPH.  With a SP CW 1641cc DR blueprinted engine in our 1960 panel camper 
conversion (AKA Nermal cause he was not normal when we got him!) loaded for 
camping or moving stuff we are quite happy with the overall performance.
