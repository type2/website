Dear volks,
I had driving with '74 air cooled bus with standard engine 1.6 L .  Every
week I drive around 400 KM with 80 Km/hr speed, problem comes out when speed
more than 100 Km/hrs with more than 100 Km distance, engine oil will be
leaking from behind of crankshaft pulley ( not a big leaking only dropping
), everyday I checked oil level, and I must re filled engine oil 0.5 Ltr
after 1000 Km driving ( initial filling 2.8 Ltr ).  Did you have problem
like me ?, please advise me.  Are there deflector, drive gear of distributor
or pulley groove had problem ?.

Regards,
Thomas
