If anyone can be of assistance certainly would appreciate a bit of
instruction.  Am converting a 1964 Kombi to 12 volt, have changed all
the bulbs, dropped down my Saphire FM/AM with a drop down resister,
dropped down the Heater blower on the same resister.  Now am
experiencing a bit of difficulty on two items.  First, does the 6V gas
gauge need to be dropped down from the 12v or will it work fine with 12V
even though it was originally 6V?  Secondly, am having trouble getting
the 12V flasher hooked up correctly.  Anyone done this and willing to
give me a bit of assistance.  Not too stupid, just unfamiliar with the
bunch of wires since the emergency flasher was removed and am uncertain
how to proceed.

The wiring diagrams I've seen don't seem to be much help with wire
colors, locations etc.  

Thanks in advance.
