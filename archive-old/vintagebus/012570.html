I know we have talked sound deadening to many degrees, but the other day
I had an idea. Yep Its friday!

The door panels and the rear hatch are always of concern for rust and
putting anything inside to lower the loud decibels of our busses. VW
decided that below the windows that open, the best thing was to allow
rain water to fall on through the the door and out the bottom of the bus
making insulation a bad idea. My thought is this:

What if there was a fabricated drip tray installed in the door that
would catch the water and transfer it to tubes that would then transfer
the water to the holes at the bottom of each door? This wouldn't be that
hard to fabricate. Any thoughts?
The other thought would be to use a zinc plate under the rubber, where
water comes in. Water picks up microscopic bits of zinc before it goes
down your dooor. Rust cant handle water mixed with zinc, and wont form.
Any thoughts, ideas? BTW if this becomes commercially possible, you know
where to send the royalty checks!

A great place to live, but you wouldn't want to visit.
