Subject: RE: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

speed envy? sure it's not some other kind of envy? (lol)  :)
those tires are too tall for the calibration of your speedo, which was
calibrated for 14&quot; rims, so take that in mind that it's showing slower than
you're actually going.
in my '59 westy: 4.12 r/p, .82 4th, 1.39:1 reduction boxes (small nut);
1600 single port-stock except for 009; tires (for now) 205/70R-14....i can
&quot;cruise&quot; at 60-65 easily, 70 if i want to push it. i remember when i had
205/75-15's (correct height)i could cruise 65-70 easily and go 70+ if i
needed to pass a truck. i do notice that i seem to have quicker
acceleration with the 14&quot; tires, but my max speed is less.
in my 61 westy: (assuming) 4.37 r/p, .82 4th, 1.26:1 reduction boxes (big
nut); 1600 single port-stock except for 009; tires 205/75-15 (correct
height)...i can &quot;cruise&quot; at 65 easily, 70 if i feel the need to pass that
truck again.
sorry, i don't have a tach, but after years of driving reduction boxed
busses, i know it's not in the &quot;sounds like i'm gonna throw a rod&quot; zone.
i don't mean to rag on anyone, but how fast do you really need to go in a
bus? i think it's fairly common knowledge that old busses are slow. i think
we all knew that before we plunked our money down to buy one (or more).
recently i got the chance to ride in a bus with freeway flier/1776 combo,
and going 70 for long periods of time was downright scary. not that it was
fast, but the sound the reduction box bearings (i think they were new) was
unbelievable. the sound of strain and definitely turning too da^n fast. i
don't think i'd want the balls or rollers to explode on me going that fast.
i've seen the results of bearings exploding, and it's not pretty, and
you'll definitely need to replace everything, including axles. plus, i
didn't think going up hills would be such a chore! i go up hills faster in
my '59 (described above).
a long time ago i had the chance to ride in a lowered 1835/straight axle
irs-ed bus. all i can say was i should have had diapers! way, way too fast,
especially with stock brakes.
no, it's not that everyone has dp engines (ugh!) and high performance
trannies. alot has to do with terrain, the mechanical state of your bus
(tune-up, compression, timing, etc..), tire size, gearing, etc... i
couldn't cruise as fast in west virginia as i could in indiana for example.
the terrain won't allow it.
again, being from the more-towards-stock crowd, i don't mind going &quot;slow&quot;.
i haven't for years. i enjoy the view out the windshields, the style of the
dash, and the elegant simplicity of it all. if i felt the need to go fast,
I'D BUY SOMETHING LIKE A JETTA OR AN (generic reference only) F-150! and
wouldn't screw around looking for the perfect combination of
engines/trannies for the rest of my life. i don't really want to go fast in
my bus. i can still make it across the country in 4 days going &quot;slow&quot;. if i
know i need to get somewhere, i leave early. i love it when some new car
zips past me in some imaginary rush, and then i either get right behind him
at the next stoplight, or they get stuck in a lane of traffic and i pass
them down the road. makes me want to toot my horn and flip them the bird! 
if getting somewhere 15 seconds ahead of me is that important to some
people, that's fine with me. PLEASE PASS, and don't tailgate me. 
how fast do you NEED to go in a bus?

&gt; Just how fast does your bus go?? 
&gt; Everybody is talking about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; my bus
&gt; only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or I am
&gt; going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case of
&gt; 'speed envy' coming on &lt;vbg&gt;.
&gt; My '67 std is stock everything with a 1600SP engine.  I am running
P225R-15
&gt; tires.  Seriously, I was courious if it is because everybody has DP
engines
&gt; and higher performance trannys, or is it something I need to go out and
&gt; check on (performance-wise).
