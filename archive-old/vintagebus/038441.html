Subject: Double Cab gas tank discussion

Hi Volks,

&quot;Gas Tank on Double Cab&quot; is the topic today...

  1)  Where is the Gas Tank located on my '63 crew?  I know that the Single
Cabs have them in a unique place, documented by the Bentley...  My other
reference is Clara's 65 Bus (not truck), where it sits in front (Front is
Front) of the engine on the &quot;deck&quot;.
  1a)  What is the procedure for getting to it.  I often find a gas odor in
the cab when I have had it parked in an inside garage (no air flow) for a
day.  I know my fuel lines are good and it is inside the cab, not the engine
compartment.  I suspect a &quot;fume&quot; leak as opposed to &quot;fluid leak&quot; as I don't
find any liquid evidence on the floor or otherwise.
  1b)  Is there a way to access the fuel tank sender, at top of tank,
without doing a complete pull?

  2) Ok, so where I see the gas tank on Cara's 65 I see an empty space on my
'63 Double Cab.  Here are photos (left side):

view of compartment, front of engine):
http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/63Crew/Engine1/FrontEngine-FromRight01.jpg  -- I'm
thinking that I have two good possible uses for this space.  a) second gas
tank, b) BN4 gas heater.  Anyone have any comments on these two possible
uses?

  3) Let's say I could fit the BN4 in the spot in front of the engine
compartment, is there any ideas on the possibility of replacing my stock
tank with a larger one?  Any suggestions on what to replace it with?  My
desire is no cuts or mods to body, just possible use of existing empty
space.

Thanks.

   Stephen Gutknecht
