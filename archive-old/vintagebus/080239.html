&gt;I don't believe there's a worse feeling in the world than when you loose faith
&gt;in your VW mechanic. The splittie
&gt;has been in a shop for two weeks-haven't heard a word
&gt;about anything --good or bad--i stopped in over the weekend to&quot;check up&quot; on
&gt;her and the mechanic was showing me that the dropped spindles i just spent
&gt;400bucks for wasn't lining up--the top where the king pin goes was 1/2 inch
&gt;away--even with all 7 or 8 shims in--
&gt;i guess the shop called &quot;the people&quot; in california to ask what the deal was
&gt;with these spindles---i'm getting some song &amp; dance crap about needing a
&gt;special tool to switch something on these new spindles.has anybody ever been
&gt;through the lowered spindle shuffle? any advice would be
&gt;greatly appreciated KEEP KOOL

I've been on the opposite end of this scenario.
I do dropped spindles, and every once in awhile I'll get a call from a 
customer telling me exactly what you're saying.
What I tell them is this.....

The 3 notches that usually (in stock arrangement) go against the control 
arms now (lowered arrangement) go on the outside away from the control 
arms. Once they spin them in the proper direction all problems are gone.

As for needing a &quot;special tool&quot; to switch something. I think the special 
tool is your foot in their ass, and your money back!
