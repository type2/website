Hi Shawn!

I'm Bill and I have a 66 Standard on blocks in the garage (need to throw 
shocks on and reassemble link pins to get her rolling). As an Iowan, I knew I 
had to have this shipped from CA (frisco) a year ago. It's a rare factory 12 
V with typical rust on cargo floor near doors. All I've restored is the 
window frames and I had to go through hell to put the torsion springs back in 
the front end to get it to stock height. I've purchased a cargo rocker, 
battery tray and rear quarter from Wolfsburg West and have some floor pieces 
on the way. It has a '68 1500 single that seems to run okay.

Anyway, I need to dump it. I'm in the process of moving to Peoria and I'm 
prepared to lose some of the $2600 I have in this thing to get it out of my 
garage. If you know any Iowan needing a splittie in good restorable 
condition, they'd be hard-pressed to find one in Iowa at this price.

I live in LeClaire, Iowa, about 20 minutes north of Davenport. I-80 and the 
Mississippi.

Bill

PS:
I feel your pain. In the past 6 years, I've seen 2 splitties in Iowa.
