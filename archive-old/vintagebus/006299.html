Subject: (friday) the truth about our VW's

I recently went and bought a 2000 jett_at_ at the VW dealership. While I was
test driving, I approached a speed bump .&quot;SPEED UP!!&quot; yelled the salesman.&quot;
FASTER! FASTER!!!!!&quot; I hit the bump goin about 50, barely phased the car.
&quot;Hahaha, nice eh?&quot; he said.
The sales guy then tells me to stop in a parking lot. He gets out and climbs
up on the open door. he then starts jumping up and down as hard as he can
with all his weight on the door and says &quot;look! doors wont sag or break!
welded hinges!!&quot;. He then proceedes to the front of the car, and kicks the
headlights as hard as he can. &quot;these babys arent breakin either!&quot; . He then
asks me if i like what i saw so far and if im interested in this vehicle. I
looked down at speedometer &quot;hmmmm 60 miles? You expect me to buy a car that
has had 60 miles of you beatin the sh!t out of it?&quot;....the salesman didnt
know what to say.
Could this be the reason some of our beloved VW's seem to have so much wear
and tear on them? sagging doors, worn out hinges, worn front end, the list
goes on. Perhaps there was a water test where they drenched them with a fire
hose to show they wouldn't leak, hence the rust plague! =)

Anyone here ever buy a new 60's bus from the dealer, what were the selling
tactics?
Did the friendly VW salesman give it the old strength test a few hundred
times before selling it to the owner?

P.S. only need 1 person from SOUTH DAKOTA to have all 50 states represented
on AIRS, please pass the word.  AIRS-   http://www.type2_dot_com/rescue
P.S.S. no i didnt buy that one with 60 miles , i insisted on one that had 3
=)
P.S.S. fiance' forced me to buy a new VW. Wouldnt take &quot;restored bus?&quot; for
an answer. Im still workin on her.
