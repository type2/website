can that Quick Canopy, shade thing for splits be used if you DON'T have the 
rail for the side tent? i have a hard top westy, but it must have not come 
with a tent cuz there is no rail on top. i thought one of these or a repop 
Riv tent might be nice to sell my t-shirts under. but with the Riv, i would 
need hardware too.
