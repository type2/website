Well we've lapsed back into the normal summer routine here in Nebraska.  Hot
muggy days, looking for any air conditioning possible, and coming home
extremely tired from work.  Since I had today off, I summoned Frank Musil
(who is just almost a Painter's Grinding and RIMCO in Lincoln, NE) down with
his camcorder.  He wasn't doing anything for the 4th so I decided today
would be the day that we test fire my 1776.

I did a bunch of odds and ends to prep the engine for the break in.  Charged
up the battery, hooked up the fuel lines, put the engine on the little skid
that I made for it, hooked up the starter, and other piddly stuff.  I found
some 6 year old fireworks in the garage and was lighting them off in the
bench vise when Frank showed up.  I showed him my little shop and a few
other things while chewing the rag.  Then it was time for business.  Frank
fired up the camcorder and we recorded the whole break-in procedure - the
whole 30 minute ordeal.  I'll edit out the best parts and get a real video
feed available on the net at a later date.

Filled her up with oil then I pulled the plugs and cranked for around 30
seconds or so until my remote op light went out.    Plugs went in, wires
hooked up, static timed the engine, and started cranking.  I had to mess
with the dizzy somewhat be she fired right up.  The old #3 cylinder was
popping and snapping some so I monkeyed with the dizzy and got her to settle
down.  Using a vise-grip and my substitute throttle cable I was able to get
the engine to sit and idle comfortable around 2200 to 2300 rpm for the full
20 minutes.  The camcorder got it all, and both Frank's camera and mine were
snapping photos.

After an eventful break in, we took a break and cruised the town in my bus
and ended up eating out at the local A&amp;W for the sole purpose of having a
rootbeer float.  After that, we came back to my house, surfed and looked at
our pix, got ahold of the tape Frank made so I can begin work on the video,
and slung the breeze until almost 10p.m.

After that, my brothers and I had fun with the fireworks.  We shot M70's in
the air with the potato cannon but ultimately resorted to firing the cannon
empty because the awesome loud bang put all the neighbors fire crackers to
shame. I bet my version was safer (and cheaper - a squirt of starting fluid
everytime will knock your socks off.) :-)

That was it - my engine ran fine, no big surprises, a couple little spot oil
leaks to check but otherwise, she sounded good!
