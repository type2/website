&gt; The thermostat didn't have the actuator rod with it.  Can I get one of

vanes
&gt; the same (with respect to post 36hp motors)?

AFAIK, yes.  The link rod in front (FiF) of the shroud is different
for doghouse and non-doghouse shrouds.  The actuator rod should come
with the vanes if you get a used set.  Be sure that the bushings are
in good shape or be prepared to replace them.
