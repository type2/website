Subject: RE: [VB] dual M/C brake upgrade- where does the &quot;T&quot; go?

Chris writ:
&gt;I'm doing a dual circuit upgrade on my brakes for my '65. So of course I'm
adding a &quot;T&quot; in the front to split the line from the M/C. Where should the
front &quot;T&quot; go? Since its a '65 I'm guessing there's no hole for the T to be.
Anyone out there with a '67 that can tell me where its supposed to be on a
'67? &lt;


I am assuming you are using Eric&amp;Barbs instructions?

If you use the Wolfgang International PN: 2611011 kit apparently you do not
need the &quot;T&quot; fitting.  I have the kit and it looks very nice, but I have not
installed it yet.

Now that I picked up a '67 last week the MC I was going to put on my '66 got
summoned for duty on the '67.  So the bay MC is headed to the '67 with a
Porsche 924 reservoir.  I will use the '67 reservoir on my '66 in the
future...  The '67 reservoir really is nicer than both the Rabbit and
Porsche 924!

Even when swapping a bay MC into a '67 it does not line up perfectly.  But
the lines can easily be bent a little to get it to work right.  It tripped
me up with only two input lines...  I am used to three :)
