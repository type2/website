I previously ran 20/50 Castrol in my 1600 with a full flow filter setup. 
On one cold morning (28 degrees), the o-ring in the properly tightened 
Fram filter blew out. I had no idea that my bus was gushing oil. 
Luckily, my son's friend was watching my bus and flagged me down as I 
pulled away. I now use 5/30 synthetic and Baldwin filters on my fresh 
engine. I am glad to report that I have no more oil or filter problems.
