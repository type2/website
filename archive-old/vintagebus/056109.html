Subject: Do you have a 67 bus with a 1500?

If you have a 67 bus with the original 1500 motor in it, I am very
interested in collecting as many pictures as possible in the next few weeks
during my tipper engine build project.

... and I'll make sure I post up all the pictures for all to see.


TIA

David
