I am with Todd on this one.I had a complete S&amp;P interior fresh from a long
ago wrecked 67 installed in my 66 and when I had the bus for sale people
wanted to buy just this panel for crazy money.If I still had this bus I
could have parted the interior and financed the resto  of my singlecab and
this was before the real insanity started.This is also a part NEEDED to
properly finish off a resto unlike an ambo fan or safaris(per Mcodes of
course).

Gee, that does not sound too outrageous to me...and I
live in Ohio! ;-)  That is probably the rarest piece
in a 21 window I would think...anyone care to back me
up on that?  I have seen very few of these over the
years...have owned one or two and folks almost beat
each other over the head when they saw me unloading it
at the swap spot!...I think I sold those couple around
$75 each and that was many many years ago.

...but now $1000 for a southwind heater..what the heck
is the deal with that!?

:-)
