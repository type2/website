I got these shocks for my 53 standard as the shocks on there (original from 
53) were not so hot any more.   But I broke off a shock bolt (upper) in spite 
of kroiling it for a week before trying to undo it, and have not since 
drilled out the broken bolt as drilling out broken bolts is oh so fun so I 
dunno how the monroes will do but they sure as heck cant be any worse.  I 
hate drilling out broken bolts.  Maybe tomorrow or next week. oh, but a pair 
of monroes were pretty reasonably priced, BTW

 This stock is in their &quot;Limited Edition&quot; line so it normally must be
 ordered.  My local Kragen/Checkers warehouse parts store just happened to
 have 3 sets in stock.
