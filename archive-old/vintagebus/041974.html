&gt; I have to admit that I hadn't gotten around to getting the red/green warning

&gt; point, possibly taking the oil and fuel wires with it.

&gt; Could these wires be the source of my problem?  If I have a new alternator
&gt; on there, and it's spinning, and it's hooked to the battery, shouldn't it be
&gt; charging?!  


Melted wires?  Sure.  The alternator may well be charging. (assuming you
hooked it up correctly...the large red wire that was on the old atl  hooks
back to the large lug on the new unit.  the 3-wire harness to the
regulator is gone.  Regulator is gone.  The wire that comes from the front
of the bus (the gen light) that USED to be attached to the regulator needs
to get pulled to the spade connector on the new alt. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

This wire provides a &quot;field&quot; voltage to the alt...an alternator has to be
kickstarted before it can begin to charge. (excited, actually)  It doesnt
need much..in fact it just pulls the remaining voltage in parallel from
the alt light (gen light..).  Should this bulb fail, fyi, you wont charge
either..)

Now that your wiring is attached correctly, you need to chase down these
melted wires of yours.  They could very well cause problems also.  Melted
insulation leads to bare metal...which then lays on bare metal...which
creates a short...and drains all of that wonderful electricity that the
alternator is trying to push into the battery! 


Go get that alt light working.;)
