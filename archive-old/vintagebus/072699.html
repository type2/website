Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

&gt; &gt; I'm running a 30/31 and don't have a idle problem but a starting problem.
&gt; &gt; It's like it's not getting enough gas and I have to pump to get it going.
&gt; &gt; I've cleaned it out and it hasn't helped.  Once going it's fine though.

It can be done, though.  I push the throttle to the floor once and release
it, then turn the key with my foot off the throttle.  Starts every time!

Keep at it!

George
