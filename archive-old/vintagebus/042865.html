Had the same problem for the longest time with my '56 bug (1776cc w/
single Holley bug spray).  I thought it was the timing, but then a friend
of mine told me I had a burnt valve (I was bummed!).  Lucky for me it was
just a tight valve, and since I had the notion that it was timing, I
didn't even check the valves.  Stupid mistake that I have learned from.
Now she purrs like a kitten!  Bug Spray leaks a little and has one heck of
a dead spot!
