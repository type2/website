I have a set of these on my 78 Champagne Westy.  I have to say honestly
that it made a HUGE difference in the handling of my bus.  The side-to-side
action on the highway is gone and my cornering ability is way improved.
Right after I bought them I drove from Arlington, VA to Blacksburg, VA
which is like 5 hours or so and I was extremely pleased.  Part of the drive
is on I-81 which is dominated by 18-wheelers going 80-90 downhill and about
40 uphill so there's ample opportunity to experience semi-wash when they
blast pass you.  The first few trucks that blew by me prompted me to
white-knuckle the steering wheel in preparation for the usual air blast but
the bus hardly moved.  That was a refreshing change of pace.  I've also
driven the bus in torrential rain with these and haven't hydroplaned yet.
I used to hydroplane regularly with the old bouncy-sidewall car tires that
I used to have.  I've also driven them in a few inches of snow with good
results.

I did get stuck in ankle deep mud at a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Nissan
Pavillion but I was parked at the bottom of the drainage area in the
parking lot so I can't really blame it on the tires.  Once I got moving
though (thanks to some really foolish people that got behind the bus and
helped push, heh-heh) I plowed through it onto the road.

All in all I'd say they're a great tire.  I don't go off-road much at all
so this was a good choice for me.  Here's a URL to the tire specs at Tire
Rack http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Bridgestone&amp;model=603V no
affiliation to me blah, blah but I've bought two sets of tires from them
with great results.
