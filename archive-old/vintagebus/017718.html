The amount of power required to run the coil is negligible compared to
just about anything else in the vehicle.

Most likely, your voltage regulator is starting to go, or is seriously
mal-adjusted, or you've got a dying battery.  The standard VW
regulator is a mechanical device that interrupts the circuit when the
voltage gets too high.  In theory, that shouldn't affect anything
downstream, because that'll only happen when the battery's fully
charged.  However, if the regulator is set to too low a voltage, or
the battery isn't capable of sustaining full voltage, you'll get these
symptoms.

I suppose it could also be a brush problem in the generator, but
that'd be a distant third option....
