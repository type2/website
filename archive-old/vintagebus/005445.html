Doesn't sound too bad to me. Assuming it's auto (safety) glass, cut-to-fit, edges finished. For a Westy with 15 slats (20 if you include the smaller non-opening ones), $75-100 doesn't seem like much compared to what you'd probably pay for original glass (if you could find it).

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;WooP, way ahead of you...  Found a custom glass place in the phonebook
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; just ordered new glass all the way around.  $5 a slat.  not bad..&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; $5 a slat??!!! Not bad???!!! What the hell do you guys do for a living??
&gt; Seems like a hell of a lot to me for a thin slab of glass.
