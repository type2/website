I got back from Kelley Park late last night.  The turnout was incredible!  I didn't drive my Bus, just so people could bug me about that.  ;)  My brother ('63 15-window) and I got there at about 7 am and had to have been at least number 200 in a line up of VWs that took over an hour just to get in the gate.  It was insane!

Once inside, we hit the swap meet, me looking for those elusive 54-55 Bus parts and my brother checking out the toys for sale.  I got a few laughs early on in the swaps with a guy selling a rusty 36hp Bus exhaust for $200 and a *used* 54-55 fuel pump for $150.  Hahaha.  I checked back near the end of the day and he had dropped on the fuel pump to $60.  He went home with those parts.

VW Howard gave me the sweet deal on some brake drums and I was able to pick up a few other parts but nothing like what I expected.  There was a lot of stuff there but everyone seemed to still have a lot of stuff at the end of the day - rear bumpers, tin, EMPI wheels, NOS parts, roof racks, etc., weird.  The sellers I did buy from insisted on only selling them to me if they were for my Bus.  I've heard that quite a few times recently, guess they're getting sick of making deals for the people that resell?  I did pick up a shift extension at the end of the day for $7, I guess people were scared to ask how much it was priced at after the eBay craziness...

In Barndoor news, there was a '55 Barndoor Panel there, nice condition, 60k original.  It was made 1 week after my '55 Kombi.  It was neat to see one so close to mine and still pretty original.  Mark Waterman brought out his '54 Single Cab too, I hadn't seen that before, nice ride.

I met Thom, saw his vintagebus_dot_com Panel, real nice Bus.  Talked to Taylor and Roger at the SV2s booth, nice guys.  Met a bunch of other people from the list too.  We ate lunch after the show with Craig aka owner of &quot;Rosie the Rocketsled&quot;.  I'm pretty sure I've seen his Double Cab before but I never really looked at it, it is _clean_.  It made the Double Cabs that were for sale at the show look like parts cars.  Some of them could have been, in California terms.

They definately need to move the show somewhere else next year if the turnout continues, or least get rid of the non-Vintage vehicles.

There was quite a few Buses there I hadn't seen before so look for photos on my site in the near future.
