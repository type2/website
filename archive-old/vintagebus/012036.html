&gt;Chuck Notmeyer has a very early '67 Kombi.
&gt;Build date of July 6, 1966, VIN 000559,
&gt;probably on the first day of '67 production.

A busy first day...

&gt;My Deluxe was built on October 5, VIN 036384.
&gt;Chuck's has backup lights, mine doesn't.
&gt;I have the later 7 1/4&quot; wide radio opening.
&gt;Don't know about his yet.

My Camper was built Aug. 30th (VIN 006649), no Backup lights
My doppelcabine was built shortly after, in Sept. maybe, also no Backup
lights.

Makes me wonder if someone didn't just add them to Chucks later...

&gt;Any other data points out there I can add?
&gt;Come on people, we need to fill Clara's head
&gt;with almost useless bus trivia, such as 
&gt;when the radio opening and Bl were changed
&gt;in the 67 busses.

I'll have to check out the radio openings this weekend.

&gt;With Chuck's having backup lights, it blows
&gt;my theory that BL were added later.
&gt;
&gt;My latest theory is that they found a stash
&gt;of non-BL rear corners in October and used them.
&gt;Whereas they wanted to showoff during the first
&gt;days of '67 production that these were the NEW
&gt;busses, and the BL beign the most visible.

I think one data point does not prove or disprove your theory...If I saw a
bus in the showroom with BU lights and I ordered one that arrived without,
I'd get upset and go buy myself a Peugeot or something...
