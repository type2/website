&gt; &gt;It's OK to transport a normal propane tank on its side with the
&gt; valve
&gt; &gt;closed.  It must be upright to draw gas properly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hoo boy - I gotta jump in here on this one. :-)  If the tanks are
&gt; supposed
&gt; to be kept upright, then why do forklifts, like the ones I use at
&gt; work,
&gt; carry their tanks on their sides?

Um, perhaps because those specific tanks are designed to operate on
their sides, just as the tanks in Westys are?
