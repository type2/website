Subject: where to start

my dad and i just brought home an old 64 kombi with a walkthru, floor
and rockerpanel rust, it runs and it is all  mine, am only 14 years old
so i have a couple of years to get it ready to drive.  my question is,
is the body bolted or welded on there is too much crap under to tell and
we could sure use a manual, if someone has scanned one could you tell me
where to find it.
