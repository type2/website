Subject: Buses by the Bridge VII/new location

    Well I have good news for  those of you that attend and for those that
have been thinking about. BBB has moved. We are now RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAKE,
there is a huge grass area, cabanas with BBQ's and a huge sandy (packed) to
camp on. I will have pics up soon for you all to see the new site. We are
now walking distance to many local food places, The London Bridge and other
city stuff. After all the complaints we have had about crazy horse we have
found a much better location to hold it. NOW the good news. The cost have
gone down, prices will be posted along with pics soon.
