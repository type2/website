&lt;&lt; I just bought a beautiful 1960 bus that I plan on restoring. The help I 
need is, where can I get good parts without spending too much money?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
Visit your local wrecking yards, go out and look for buses that have been 
left to rot into the ground and find owner of property the bus is on and see 
if you can buy these buses to resell or part out if too far gone.  Get on 
auction lists for towing companies.  Even if the buses are not your type or 
year you hopefully will be able to sell at a profit or trade for the parts 
for what you do need.  Plus go to the VW and even non-VW swap meets often and 
EARLY!   Eric&amp;Barb
