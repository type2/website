Rick, i've had the same symptoms appear on two different buses. 

on one, it turned out to be a gummed up outlet at the base of the fuel tank. over time, gas turns to a tar/shelac-like substance that can clog your metal fuel lines...this from sitting for many years unattended. i chased all kinds of stuff until finally, one time with the engine removed, i decided to pull the gas tank and probe the outlet at the bottom of it. There's a screen in there that keeps junk in the tank from going into your filter and carb. if you poke too far, you'll poke through it. some people think that's bad. it certainly will give you a bunch of trash in our filter and maybe your carb if you don't clean the filter often enough. the gummy stuff is below the screen, so you don't need to poke through it, probably. you can do this with the tank in the bus, but be careful of gas, and be sure to disconnect your battery. you're right at the starter down there, with sparky, the starter post right next to your face waiting to make bus (and you) go BOOM! also, gas goes right through the pores of your skin, so i really don't like getting it on me.

on the other bus, the symptom was caused by intake leaks. if you've recently had your intake manifold/carb off, check the connections. Also, check your intake boots if you have the '71-style dual-port riser. As i understand it, when there is an intake leak, the bogging, which i've referred to previously as a hiccup, is caused by too rich a fuel mixture. if you reused your old metal gaskets for intake or exhaust...well, there's your problem right there. they only seal once. period. ask me how i know. ;)

i imagine what happens is that the intake (aka vacuum) leak keeps some of the gaseous fuel from flowing into our heads as it changes the dynamics of airflow within the system. as that fuel collects, it liquifies or at least becomes a more dense gaseous/air mixture; when that finally reaches your head, the fuel-wetted spark plug can't ignite it, so you get that bogging...as the exhaust valve opens and closes a couple times, drying out the wet spark plug, which then ignites again.

Keep in mind that i'm no mechanic and i'm not an engineer. i'm just a dude with a computer who's into old buses and trying to figure out mechanical stuff. hope my words help in some way and watch for someone on the list to correct me if i'm wrong...key word in the paragraph above was 'imagine.' 

Thanks! Joe (with messed up shift key)
