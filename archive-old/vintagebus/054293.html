Subject: Re: [VB] Tent poles

Hmm.  I can take that tent off your hands, and a set of Greg's poles,
and put a tent on the other side of the DD panel!

&gt; I would agree with Greg- I spent literally years looking for tent poles for my mid 60's striped westy tent ( I assume that Greg is talking about the westy tent that attaches to the side of the bus rather than the &quot;stand alone&quot; 68-&gt; tents)  As it was I ended up buying another tent. I too thought about repopping tent poles but have yet to get around to doing it :)
