&lt;&lt; 1.  Did brakes and bearings on the 67.  Only grease I had on hand was 
white multi purpose.  Subsequently realized that there is drum brake grease 
for wheel bearings.  Will the white stuff be ok, or should I re-pack the the 
other stuff?? &gt;&gt;

always buy the best grease (synthetic or regular) that you can afford.  
something that is made for high temp, high load, high speed bearings.  
inferior grease will NOT cut it.
