What the hell is all the fuss about?  Who gives a damn about who is the
&quot;supreme&quot; obscure parts TigerBeat Hunk of the Month?  Enjoy your bus for
what it is and back up your opinions (and unless you bought the bus new
and no one else has ever touched your bus it IS only an opinion) with
whatever facts you have to back up your opinion without resorting to
insults.  (wow, was that a long sentence or what?)

Here is my $0.02...

Take a look at this diagram from the 1958 VW Spare Parts List Type 2:

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/bastard/bac.jpg

This shows the 261 129 611B Air cleaner (oil bath, suspended)

I have 2 of these (one of which came from Neil Pickett).  They have the
part number stamped in them as well as &quot;LB 610&quot; and the manufacturer name
&quot;KNECHT&quot; stamped within a diamond.  The lower bowl for the oil bath clamps
to the upper lid of the oil bath via 3 short cam-clips.  The air enters
the oil bath via vents in the side of the lower oil bath bowl.  The lower
oil bath bowl is also stamped with &quot;Olstand&quot;.

Now take a look at this diagram from the 1959 VW Transporter Workshop
Manual printed in 5.59 that features (guess what?) the bastard 40hp
engine:

The oil bath pictured appears to be the exact same air cleaner that is in
the 1958 Spare Parts List.

I have 2 other air cleaners in the shop, and I think they are both 40hp
air cleaners.

On one 261 129 613 is stamped as well as &quot;LB 625/1&quot; and the manufacturer
name &quot;KNECHT&quot; stamped within a diamond.  This one has a snout for the air
intake into the lower bowl &amp; the lower bowl attaches to the upper tube via
3 long cam-clips, sandwiching the lid &amp; filter element in between.

On the other 261 129 613A is stamped as well as the manufacturer name
&quot;Mann&quot;.  It is almost identical the the last one otherwise.

I have another 36hp I could look at in my '57 Kombi for another data
point if we have not already beaten this one to death...
