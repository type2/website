Subject: RE: [VB] NON VW 1500 muffler

I used an Ernst when I converted the Thing engine for use in the Single Cab.
If fit like a dream but then I have had really crappy Brazilian and Mexican
made mufflers in the past.  I don't think you could go wrong with either
Ernst or Leistritz.  There was some OG VW stamped 1500 mufflers on Eb_at_y
recently so you might look there.
