Subject: reduction box project
Mime-Version: 1.0


Finished the overhaul of the reduction boxes.  Took a little more than 4
hours per side, and that is with having all of the parts and tools on-hand,
and cleaning/degreasing and painting everything as I went.

On each side, all of the bearings looked beautiful, except for the lower
outers, which showed heavy wear.  I replaced both of those and left the
others alone.

This cured the wobble I had in the driver's side rear wheel, and hopefully
will clear up the leaking axle seals as well.

Next project: new brakes and running gear for the '55 westy!
