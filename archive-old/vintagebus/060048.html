Subject: Re: [VB] Ribbed bumper paint question

back of my 57 sc were grey, back of the 58binz are dove blue. both trucks
had black splash's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did VW paint the back of ribbed bumpers?

I just picked up a rear ribbed bumper and while the face has 3 coats of
paint, the back is in factory NOS-style dark grey primer.
