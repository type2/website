Subject: Re: 1965 Master Cylinder


	Has anyone changed their single master cylinder unit out with a 71-79
Master cylinder?
I am wondering what is involved with the brake lines and what year Rabbit
reservoir is needed? It looks to me like the one that I got from  wolfsberg
west. It was for my 67 it came with a aluminum spacing plate and the back
brake sensors is pointing down slightly on the master but the reservoir fit
perfect.

Any help is appreciated!

Fighting time for a May show got to get the bus on the road :-)
