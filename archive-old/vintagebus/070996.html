Subject: motorola regulator

Ok, in regards to my '58 panel with a 160DP.  I will crawl into the engine
compartment tonight and find out for sure if it is a motorola alt.  (pretty
sure it is an alt, as it does not look anything like a generator)  If it is a
motorola alt, where do I get the voltage regualtor that plugs on top?   Also,
anyone have any spare bottom tin laying around for said motor that they want
to trade for coffee?
