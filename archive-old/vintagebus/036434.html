Dave sold it to a guy at the last nor. cal. auction. for about 24-25K.
The guy who bought it knowing nothing about VW's had apparently seen a 21 
window fetch 40K at another auction and thought this &quot;Frankenstein&quot; bus would 
be a good investment till the next auction.

Looks to be Dave Orozco's. If so it was on Everetts' page for awhile for I
think $32,500.00. Guess he didn't have any bites.............
