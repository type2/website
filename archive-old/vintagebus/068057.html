Subject: Re: [VB] NOS door question

Hi clara,
60-63 was my first thought, but then i noticed the flattened raised part , which was used on the
later doors for the hole and handle tip mounting. Heres a shot of the door your thinking of, no flat
spot for the handle tip:

And heres the later door which i beleive he has, notice the raised flat spot for the handle tip to
be drilled into:

Thoughts on that?

&gt; A beautiful nov 60 through dec 63 door!  For the pull handle, you see.  It
&gt; was not an oversight that the other hole wasn't drilled.  Takes a differnt
&gt; door mecanism too.    I have a beautiful 67 drivers door I'll trade you for
&gt; it.  That door would be great on my 61.
