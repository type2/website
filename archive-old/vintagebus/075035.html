Subject: 64 to 67 front disc rotors

  By George I think we got it. After years of pressing my inporter, I was
just informed that they just brought in 40 rotors for the late 70's
Brazilian buses (these were still king and link pin beams).  According to my
Brazil parts book these should fit right on the 64 to 67 spindles, a good
start for a stock disc brake conversion. I will have samples here on Friday
to test fit. Now to only make the brackets /or get them to do the total
conversion! These rotors will also fit on my NEW  manufactured dropped
spindles (2 to 4 1/2 inch drop of your choice).available real soon.
