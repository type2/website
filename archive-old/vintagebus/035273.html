Hi Travis,
You are welcome!  We personally are quite happy with our 60 panel camper 
conversion bus.  We have installed a 3.875 R&amp;P freway flier and SP 1641cc 
engine with type 4 cooler and oil/filter pump.  Driving through the Siskyus 
Mountians on the S. border of Oregon and into N. Cal. we only shift down to 
second gear and do 25MPH on three uphill slopes with our two short roof racks 
full of swap goods and camping gear inside the bus.  Otherwise we are able to 
keep the bus between 30-45MPH on the other steeper hills in third gear.
Plus with this build of engine if anything goes wrong with P&amp;Cs, oil cooler 
or oil/filter pump we can install stocker parts in there to get us home 
instead of waiting for a shipment of exotic and thusly possibly hard to get 
parts!
  We know of a family that ended up in Whitehorse on the ALCAN highway for a 
whole week due to not being able to phone anybody at the factory that 
manufactured the special clutch parts for his bus.  Turned out the shop had 
closed to attend a manufacturing convention during that entire week!
