&quot;Has anybody out there driven a 40 HP 1500 plus miles on a single journey???
I really want to drive the side loader single cab back from iowa/nebraska,
but have never had a long distance experience with a totaly stock bus!!! It
should be a blast as the bus has been totally restored (refreshed?) rebuilt
engine, new brakes, paint, interior, etc. so the ride should be nice and the
bus should make it, anybody want to meet me in Iowa and ride back to az.or
New Mexico, doing some wrecking yarding and bus hunting along the way?? Have
tools will travel.

Myself and two friends took my 60 double cab to about a third of the way down Baja with a
stock 40 horse and small nut tranny, from Washington. We had surfing and windsurfing gear as
well as camping gear. I was a long slow haul but you know how splitty travel goes...the first
20 minutes crawl by...an hour later you can't believe you haven't really gone any
where...pretty soon you get in the groove and relax, next thing you know 36 hours later you
are in Baja.
Good luck on your adventure,
