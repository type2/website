Hi Matt,
You can install a single circuit MC in all pre-1968 buses with no problems.  
VW acually began experimenting with dual circuit MCs in the 1966 bus.  This 
1966 dual circuit only MC and it's resivoir will not fit the 1967 bus MC, or 
resivoir.  
  Yes, you can drive with a single circuit MC if you have replaced all of 
your flex lines, slave (Wheel cylinders.), and metal lines, but still the 
dual circuit offers an increase in safety over the single circuit MC.  
Remember that pressures over 1200 PSI occur in the brake fluid and if there 
is and weak point it is likely to give away!  We know of a fellow who had to 
bury the front nose of his just finished restoring delux bus into the back of 
an UPS truck to stop it from going though anymore intersections down a steep 
hill in busy downtown traffic in Canada.  Know another fellow who rebuilt his 
brake system and had a problem of a leaking slave cylinder that turned out to 
be cracked from the factory.  The crack would only leak during extreme 
braking, not during bleeding of the brakes.  Plus another fellow who rebuilt 
his brake system except for the metal lines and next thing he had no brakes 
due to the long metal line going to the rear blew out due to corrosion from 
the inside that had weakened the wall of the line.
  So while one may save themselfs $30.00 by not converting to dual circuit.  
Staying with the single circuit MC they may very well cost them not only 
thier entire bus, but thier, and/or passenger lives in the long run.
