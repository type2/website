Subject: Re: Balancing Tires.......

Thanks Matt for the tips....... The one thing I forgot to mention was that
the second rim that previously balanced OK and is now  apparently &quot;bent&quot;
never saw the road. It was the spare.

Driving the '67 was fine with no vibration....... what started this need to
rebalance is one of my tires took a screw in the sidewall, so ordered a
couple of new replacements. Wide fives may be relatively more prone to
damage, but they are not weak and will take a lot of abuse to a point.

Scott

&gt; I have heard, but cannot confirm, that the wide-five wheels were more
&gt; prone to damage than the later style wheels.
