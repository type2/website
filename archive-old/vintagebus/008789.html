&gt;Does anyone know if a Saphire I is correct for a 59/60 bus?  If not
&gt;what is?
&gt;
I believe it is.

&gt;Yesterday I was looking at my visors for my 23 window and noticed that
&gt;I only had the driver's visor.  I noticed that the holes for the
&gt;passenger's visor were not drilled.  Is it correct to only have one
&gt;visor for a 59/60 bus? Or were having two visors an option?
&gt;
One of my '59 brochures:

shows only a driver's side padded visor in the Deluxe.
