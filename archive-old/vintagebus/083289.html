Subject: Re: [VB] More on 356 Porsche Pulley and ramblings

I will chime in on this one too. I purchased a 356 pulley from Real Source.
It fit right onto my old pulley bushings. Used my old washers too. These are
the orginal washers as far as I know. I used an 890mm belt that rides close
to the outside diameter on the pulley. I also have a furnace brazed and
balance fan from Scat along with one of their standard degree pulleys on the
crank.
I have wound things up pretty tight. Now I don't want any flames but with my
freeway flier I have set upon over 50mph in third once or twice and 80 in
fourth once. No complaints from the engine compartment. I don't yet have
any instrumentation to give temperature results. The engine is out once more
for adjustments so it will be a few weeks before it is back in and running.
I have not had a chance to check for belt slippage. Hope to do that sometime
too.

Chris
