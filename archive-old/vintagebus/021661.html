Subject: Barndoor Steering Wheel on a 59'?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Happy Monday everyone:)-
I'm looking for a Barndoor steering wheel to put on my 59' and was wondering 
if there are certain years of BD wheels that fit and others that don't. If im 
not mistaken, wasnt there a change in the steering column in 52 or 53? 
Thom, don't you have a BD wheel on your 55'?
How much are the Koch's wheels?

BTW: If anyone has a nice BD steering wheel (preferably black but would take 
white) and a nice church key apron w/ no cuts or rust please let me know.

thanx alot-Pete
 59' panel
 74' super vert
