&gt; At a generic (non VW) FLAPS I found a 36mm super heavy duty socket
at the
&gt; price of $12.99.
&gt; 
&gt; Here in the Pacific NorthWest it was at _Al's Auto Supply_ (I believe
&gt; &quot;Grant&quot; in Oregon?).  Anyway, the company who packages it is in
Seattle
&gt; given the address printed on it:  Performance Tool.  Part number is
&quot;W154&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It is a very heavy black chrome-moly steel tool.  1/2 inch drive, 6
point.
&gt; Appears more than suitable for the worst abuse, including impact
tools.

The socket will probably last forever, but it will kill a lot of
flex-handles and slide-handles in its lifetime!

For the torques involved in wheel nuts and gland nuts, the 1/2 inch
drive is really marginal.  I have a collection of broken 1/2 inch
drive handles to prove it.

I've been much happier with the 3/4 inch drive socket and handles I've
been using for the last few years.  The socket isn't that much more
expensive, around $20 or so.  This is for a lifetime tool that you
will never wear out unless you make a business of VW repair.

OTOH, it might be a good thing to have around with a 3/8 drive adapter
for removing the big nut on the fan.  The 3/8 inch drive would remind
one that, despite its size, the fan nut isn't a high torque part.
