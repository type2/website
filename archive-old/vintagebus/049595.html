Subject: Bus Marley

While watching a PBS show on Mr. Marley (American Masters... tho Bob was
Jamaican...  oh well, this is the same network that puts Yanni on and calls
it kultur) I saw an odd pickup - it had the horizontal louvers right below
the bed like stock p/us, BUT it looked more like someone had cut the top
offa regular Kombi. IE, there was a 6&quot; high or so curved metal wall all
along the pickup bed (cept for the rear), instead of gates. If that makes
sense. Looked very well done.

Was this a factory thang? Or did Lee Scratch Perry get holt of it :)

There were MANY busses all over the place in the background, tho this was
the most obvious variant.
