Joe,
  When I was at Radio Shack picking up the $29 am/fm 
cassette a listee posted about (thanks), I saw a antenna 
that might work for you. It is the tape kind that you 
stick to a window. I am going to put it under the dash 
from end to end. The counter guy said they work well so 
we will see.
  I will be keeping Adam Bruno and Floyd in mind tho. I 
was sorry to hear the bad news, but I'm glad you are ok 
Adam.

I hate to drill it, but if I do put an antenna on the 
car I'd prefer to do
so in an original style - realizing this was a dealer 
job &amp; so I probably 
have a bit of latitude.
