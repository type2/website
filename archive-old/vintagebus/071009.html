Subject: Bessie Goes to the Movies--

Bessie is finally over on the movie set &quot;The Rain Makers&quot;   She was asked to
do 3 days of filming  and ended up doing 12+ days-
I even got to do play an Extra --sort of a Papa Hippie--Great fun LOTS of
work for 4 weeks in 100+ degrees heat !! Movie people work at least 12 hour
days !! Most were from California and were fried in the sun  One day had to
be re-shot as it was 115 degrees and the film melted--Bessie was the ONLY
car on the set,that started every time she was asked.  Hooray for the VW Bus
!! Jon Stanton's double cab also started every time and also gets a lot of
movie time!!  Movie to be released early in 2004--  Stay tuned--uj, TWWM
