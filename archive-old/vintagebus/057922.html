Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch loose all of a sudden

The clutch cable is probably getting ready to break. Check for fraying
at each end. I've usually found the problem at the tranny end right
where the cable joins the threaded part.

&gt; I thought the clutch wing nut was backing off because the clutch was
&gt; going away over a week. I tightened it, and it was fine.  Today, there
&gt; is no clutch because the cable is too loose. The wing nut was where I
&gt; left it, but the pedal now to the floor with too much slack in cable.
&gt; What is up??? Any ideas?
