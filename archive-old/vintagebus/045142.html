&lt;&lt; I am replacing my 30PICT1 on the 70 (suspect it has bushing leaks) and

Hi Craig,
The 30/31 should be really the same as the 30 PICT-3 carb and should be tuned 
the same way as the 34 PICT-4 carb (See our article on how to adjust this 
carb in the type 2 library.

&lt;&lt;my questions are:   which of the two pilot jets goes in which hole? There 
are two jets (on RH side of carb, one facing more to the back), a 90.55 and a 
90.65, but they
 were out when I got the carb and don't know which circuit gets which jet - 
or if it matters.&gt;&gt;
Hmm, good question.  The 30 PICT-3 shows an idle jet in the rear one and a 
shut off jet that should have a jet size to it in the forward spot.

 I put the bigger one in the rear orifice for the hell of it for now......
 Next, how to adjust the beast?
 Adjusting the big idle screw on the throttle arm works to an extent, but I 
have to screw the thing in almost all the way.  And turning the idle mixture 
screw seems to yield no results at all (and yes, carb has been tanked and 
cleaned).  Let's not even discuss the great big screw lurking just next to 
it!&gt;&gt;
Just a guess but it sounds like your idle and possibly main jets are too big. 
 Having to adjust the throttle arm screw so far probably help to allow enough 
air into the engine to keep it from choking on so much fuel.

&lt;&lt;Main jet is a 125,  engine is a 1600, carb is a 009 while I rebuild some 
others to play with.  &gt;&gt;
Assuming that when you write &quot;carb is a 009&quot; that you mean it is the 
distributor.  Plus if you are running a stock muffler and exhuast the 
following jets should be pretty close to what you need.
Main jet 112.5
Air correction jet with emulsion tube 140z
pilot jet  65
Idling air jet drilling  135
Auxiliary fuel jet  45
Auxiliary fuel jet drilling 130
Bypass air cut-off valve  1.8 (Could this be the forward idling jet you have?)
Power fuel jet  100
Hope this helps, Eric&amp;Barb
