I don't see any evidence of any extra wiring.
No holes or mounting brackets where a gas heater would have been.
The original motor has the bracket behind the coil for the aircleaner (The 
fan shroud had been changed as some time, so I can't guarantee the 
originality of that).
Anyone gotphotos of the ducting setup? Were gas heaters VW installed or 
dealer installed?



Not sure, but I think dealer installed.  I have a reprint of a service bulletin that details the dealer install right down to the location of intake/exhaust holes in the sheet metal.  Which, by the way, your bus will have if a heater were installed.  There would have been 3 holes. One for the exhaust (largest) intake (smaller) and gas overflow tube (smallest) punched in the sheet metal just to the left of the motor.

For the earlier motors with the aircleaner on the left of the motor, the heater install kit came with a bracket to relocate the aircleaner to the opposite side (like the later motors).  I've never seen one of these in person..only in pictures.


One more thing.  Thinking back on it, the hole cut to the passenger compartment is usually a rectangle set on end which matches a plenum's shape (look at the brochure here http://type2_dot_com/library/heating/oldeber.htm ), and not a circular hole.
