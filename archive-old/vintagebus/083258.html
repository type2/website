Subject: Need plywood.

Hi,

I am finally to the camper restoration stage on my bus. The original plywood
seems to be ash. I need 1/8&quot; as well as 1/4&quot; thick. I can find 1/4&quot;, but 1/8
does not seem to be available to my sources here in So. Cal.

Anyone know of a source for 1/8&quot; ash ply?

It has been suggested that I use another material and add an ash veneer. I
would rather not do that.

Thanks,
Chris Dreike
