I finally registered a set of '56 plates for the panel today.  It took
*45* minutes at the window - these poor people have no idea what they're
doing!  I have a set of NOS plates, and they were certain they were fake.
Then they had to measure them - you know, with a ruler.  Then they had to
dig up a normal plate to measure, to compare.  Why?  Because the form
has a field called &quot;plate dimensions&quot; on it.  Arrrg!

Ok, thanks for letting me rant.
