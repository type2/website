Since I've kind of got page torn down right now, I just upped a WHOLE ton of
pix from the KCMO trip.  Check out the multiple indexes at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/kcmotrip/robs/index.htm

They pix are kind of slopped together so here's a brief rundown:

Index 1 - Pix of my bus on the way there.  The one fuzzy picture turned out
to be a work of &quot;busart&quot; IMHO.  You can see my porsche pulley conversion, me
pulling the bus out of the driveway at Dan Buser's house in Cameron, MO and
assorted pix of MoKan show.

Index 2 - Few more pix of the show then pix of Dan Kinsey cutting the roof
off from a 21 windows bus.  Don't worry folks - this was the more rusty bus
I've ever seen.  Honest to pete, there was _NO_ place to put a jackstand
under this bus but what it would come through the floor.  The roof section
was the best part and it went to a good home.  Justin Laffoon is the kid in
the orange shirt.  Next we have Dan's appleby camper (these things are very
westy feeling.)  Dan would like to mount one on top of a bus.  Anyone got an
Appleby for sale?

Index 3 - One more Appleby picture, then the Eriba Puck, followed by an
assortment of vintage bus literature, parts of Dan's VW toy collection, and
what's left of the 54 SC rustbucket.

Index 4 - Cruising with Dan Kinsey in the Binz (see Rob Laffoon's smile and
the star on his shades?) :-)  Dan in his Binz and more px of the show.

Index 5 - And finally, more pix of the show.

Notice how in the background of some of these pix the sky is getting really
dark.  This was before it poured rain that afternoon.  Also, pay close
attention to the swap area and if you look close in the background, you can
see Dan's Binz.

Enjoy the pix while they last volks because I'll have to take most of them
down when I get my reworked pages up and running.

Later!
