Subject: Securing Front Emblem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Can someone tell me how in the heck you can secure your front emblem back on 
the nose of your bus. I have only been able to get 1 lock tab right lower. 
The others for get about it! behind the fuse box, behind the wiper motor, the 
fourth???

Do I need to hire a yogi? or a kid or lady with long slender fingers.

Trust your neighbor?????
