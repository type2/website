......  How would you
&gt;&gt;&gt; post something like that though?

Hmmmm. They could be posted as an autocad or DWG file which unless you had
the software you wouldn't be able to open, but you could just forward the
file to a Kinkos' which could open/plot the drawings full size or w/ match
lines for say the long wall panel or other panel bigger than 36&quot; x 48&quot;?

This might get expensivo, so maybe the thing to do is some actual
construction documents w/ dimensions etc. to scale that you could lau out on
butcher paper/cardboard  w/ a tape measure/square_dot_compass, etc.

 It's too big to
&gt;&gt;&gt; print out and copy onto the new panel.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm, I suppose you could break them up into 36&quot; x 48&quot; sections that are
&gt; jpegs or pdf's or something else common, &amp; then print them out on your
&gt; printer &amp; tape em together w/ match lines like I did w/ Thom's colored
&gt; wiring diagrams.  Or they could be emailed to a printer w/ a large plotter &amp;
&gt; printed out full size??
&gt; Kinko's could do this if you gave em a autocad or similar file.
