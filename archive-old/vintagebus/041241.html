Post on the T3 group indicated there was a double
door bus in a junkyard.  I asked for details and
John sent this message. Hope someone in bus land
can find something useful off this bus.

Jeff -

The junkyard in question is in Grand Rapids, MN (read
as road salt city).  It is at Chuck's Auto Salvage
(218)328-6281 or (800)300-6281.  It is an early
bus(not sure what year) and it has a pair of doors
on either side, not sliding doors.  I don't think
there is much on it that is worth saving.  The bottom
6 inches of the body is pretty much shot.  It is
rusty around the front window frames (sorry, no
safari's).  The rear wheel openings have
been radiused.  The bumpers are trashed, the interior is trashed.  It had a camper kit in it.  Looks like
just the interior stuff, no pop-top.

There might be a few small items that would be worth
pulling like door handles, gages, taillight lenses
and stuff like that.

Post this to the Vintage bus list and if anyone wants
me to take a look for a specific trinket the next
time I go back I will. Please e-mail me with your
requests at jaranson_at_the-bridge_dot_net.

Later,
