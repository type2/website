Floors, see I was thinking that I can patch the floors and only replace the
bad spots. I even thought about getting the small pieces like some of them
have 10&quot; wide sheets. Anybody know of a good place except for a donor. If
anything, I'll replace the whole thing then. I hope Ronnie gets his hands on
some sheet metal soon so I can buy from him.

Later,

California Imports?
&gt; &gt; Anybody tried their sheet metal? I.E. rockers and cargo floors? Looks
like
&gt; &gt; they have good prices.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Andre;
&gt;
&gt; Driver side rocker I got was about 3/4&quot; too short, inner rockers fit well
&gt; the outriggers I got from them were mislabeled, fronts said they were the
&gt; back, etc.
&gt; the floor doesn't look like an original floor at all, but did fit rather
well.
&gt;
&gt; that's all that I know
&gt;
