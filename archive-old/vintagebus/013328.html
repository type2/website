I do have a question that I hope someone can answer for me.  Does the
exhaust from the oil cooler have to be enlarged to handle the whole flow of
air?  I can open up the oil cooler exhaust pipe to accomodate the larger
passageway formed before it but doing so won't really create a larger
opening  for the hot air to escape.  Does the whole exhaust have to be
enlarged?  I'd appreciate some feedback on this.

There are 5 major outlets on the doghouse blower housing . .

So as an analogy, we'll get a bucket full of water and put 
five holes in it . . for simplicity we'll say all five holes 
are the same size and are streaming out an equal amount of water.

If I make one of the holes larger, it will start streaming more 
but all the rest will be streaming less . . you see ?

The exhaust outlet for the cooler is one of those majors . .
It's restricted in fact . . 

If you open it up larger, you are depriving the other 4 majors
of their fair share of the blower output . .

I would not do this without putting instrumentation on both 
heads and both plenums to determine what I could live with.
