&gt; &gt;Your views on wanting a '55 book are no doubt shared by many

&gt;
&gt; The 1955 manual does not cover barndoors.  It covers March
&gt; 1955-58, but the only change between them &amp; up to May 1959
&gt; is the bumpers.  The 1952/53 manual covers barndoors &amp; I
&gt; realize that is a much more limited market and not economically
&gt; feasible to reprint.
&gt;

My face is red.
I wrongly assumed that a pre 55 would go on back to 52.


&gt; &gt;I &quot;need&quot; a pre 1963 Bentley

&gt; I am a little confused...  You &quot;need&quot; a pre-63 Bentley?  You have

&gt; a 1961 which is mechanically identical to a 1963:  Same 40hp
&gt; engine, same front end, same early syncromesh tunnel-case
&gt; transmission, same reduction boxes, same brakes...  the only
&gt; differences between a 1961 and a 1963 are cosmetic:

This is indeed good news.
I can purchase the current &quot;in print&quot; manual.


&gt;
&gt; &gt;What it all comes down to is that Bentley holds all the cards;

Back to you Dave,
you wrote,-

&gt; I have a 1955 VW Transporter Workshop Manual I am
&gt; willing to loan to Robert Bentley and Neil Pickett made a similar
offer.

Is Neil's copy the * exact * same copy as yours?

&gt; I agree we need to be unified in our efforts, but I also think we need
to
&gt; be realistic as to what would be easier to market.
&gt;
&gt; In terms of which edition to reprint, I hope I made my point clear...
;)

Yes, 1955 - 58.

&gt;  I think we should ask for a printed version.

Amen

&gt;
&gt; These are my opinions, but I realize I am not the Alpha &amp; Omega of
&gt; the Vintage Bus Kingdom.

Could we have a open forum for a set period of time and then a
spokesperson to communicate directly with Bentley on behalf of the list
?

&gt;  I will support whatever the consensus of
&gt; this list and NEATO members feel is most appropriate.

Thank you Dave (and all.)
