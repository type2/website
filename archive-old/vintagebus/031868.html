1.   Glass repo HELLA 58 to 61 tail light lens These are red glass lens with
out the gold on the back. These only say HELLA on them. No numbers. codes,
etc. I also have some repo plastic lens and a few NOS and good used original
lens. Call or E-mail for prices.

2. Back after being out of stock. H 4 headlight bulb assemblies. These
aren't like the ones you see with the flat lens, but are curved like regular
headlight bulbs. These also have a running light bulb in the bulb houseing.
These come with the 55/60 watt bulbs.

3. Fiberglass repo's of the bus pressed (stamped) bumpers. I have these in
stock (these are made by us) in standard and truck rear, also have the
fronts. Brackets and splash pans are in the works.

4. Window felt channels. These are made in Italy and after a long absense we
have these back in stock.
WCM has been out for months do not have any comeing in for a while (so I've
been informed).

5. Also back in stock are the 62 to 71 complete tailight assemblies. These
are the ones that have the wires coming out of the bulb holder and a ground
wire tab on the housing.
