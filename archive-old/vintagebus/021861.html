&gt;I went to close the engine lid on the 1967 bus and right hinge pin broke.&lt;


I just got out the old dremel tool and used the cutter bit (not drill bit-
it will break) to drill a hole through the hinge and then put a nail through
it.  Cheesy yes, but effective in a pinch.

If you need new ones I think Wolfsburg West has them as repos.  I have been
unsuccessful in finding good ones in a junkyard.


Good Luck,
