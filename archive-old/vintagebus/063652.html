Subject: berg and other parts for sale

before i put these up on ebarf:

gene berg 243 - cast iron full-flow oilpump cover, fitted with 45 
degree fitting for clearing rear bus mounting bars, 68-71.
this is the non-relief version.  sealed - $20 + $5 shipping.

gene berg 341A - swivelfeet adjusting screws, set.  this package was 
sealed, but i opened it to read the  instructions inside and check 
print date... the adjusters appear to have been made between 1985 and 
1992. so this SHOULD be a set resistant to breaking, but no 
guarantees. (tip - soak em in oil overnight before installing!)
$30 + $4 shipping

note - a listee wanted the swivelfeet, but i misplaced your addy!  so 
he gets first dibs if he still  wants 'em.

pauter 69mm counterweighted crank, 8-doweled and wedgemated to 
lightened flywheel, then balanced. mains STD and rods .10 over. 
endplay set at 0.32.  serial #13676, made in early 80s. was in 
cosmoline when i got it; i cleaned it to test fit it into my case. 
since A) everyone has told me i will HATE the lightened flywheel in a 
bus and B) it needs more attention to detail than i am competent to 
supply (rods will need to be slightly clearanced, or journal flanks 
filed a bit, whole thing should be blueprinted... ie, its more for a 
race motor than my bus!), i am getting a crank w/ a NON lightened FW. 
so i am looking for best offer over $350 + shipping on this one.

NOS kolbenschmidt pistons, in box. label reads: &quot;Volkswagen 1600TL 
Zylinder    4 Voltarist 054.33       86,45 = 86,46  oversized&quot; 
...with '45' in pen. i THINK these will turn a 40hp into a 1600, but 
i don't know. part # written in pen says 341-107-120A  but its not in 
my parts books.
best offer over $75 + shipping.

someone buy this stuff so's i can pay ronnie for my new crank  :) !
