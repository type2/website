Subject: A New Engine.

Thanks guys,

Yes, its a CW crank in a 1776. All parts balanced. I have a FF tranee with a
3.88 r&amp;p. The noise and vib are about the same I have always had. At freeway
speeds its just too loud. I suspect there is a natural frequency and
resonance involved here. Lots of sound proofing installed too. I started
with a layer of dynamat extreme, then a layer or two, depending on the area,
of JCW NASA insulation. On the floor in back all the way over the engine
compartment I also installed 2 layers of heavy roofing material. I must have
nearly 180 pounds of soundproofing inside. Its probably one of the quietest
buses around, but not quiet enough for me. The noise is low frequency, kinda
like the exhaust note, so it is very difficult to damp out. I may try double
glazing the windows, especially the rear hatch, with some plexi before I do
the engine.

Road noise is quite low (foot on clutch, foot off gas), with all the floor
padding I installed, as is wind noise since I added some extra sealing to
the front doors.

Hopin to have something done by end of summer.

I did check in with the VanaRu guys, no one I contacted seemed to know much
about splitties. They are mostly converting water cooled Vanagons. No
radiator placement problems there. The guys that know the most are down
under.

I suspect that if I can come up with a good way to do this, it could become
popular.

Yeah, I know, if it isn't Air Cooled, it isn't a VW. But what about all
those guys that put V8's in their stretch buses? We still call it a bus or
is it a Westfailure?

Chris
