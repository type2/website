BE CAREFUL, heating and quenching (with water) tempers steel and has a
tendency to make it brittle, from my understanding the shock bolts are
allready heat treated and heating hardened steel is a no no. Ive seen VW
trailing arms snap in half after gussets were welded on and the part was
quenched with water to cool, it's best to let it cool natureally or use
quenching oil. 

this is just an opinion and I could be wrong, but this is what I have
learned from experience.

grease...

I use anti-sieze for this, even better than grease! its basically grease
with graphite dust suspended in it, so when/if the grease fries off, there
is still graphite to keep it from rusting solid :)

take care,
