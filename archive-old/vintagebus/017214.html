Depends on your definition of &quot;easy&quot;.  If you're willing to pull the
engine (which I kind of infer from you being in the process of
replacing oil lines), then it's pretty straight-forward to unmount the
fan from its shaft and fish through the hole towards the cooler.  This
can be done with the engine in, if you're flexible, have long arms,
are willing to sacrifice a wire clothes hanger, and can be very
delicate (you really don't want to puncture the cooler with the
hanger).  I'd consider it easier to pull the engine.

Of course, if you're going to pull the engine, it's just not that much
more labour to pull the generator, intake manifold, and fan housing
off to look at things in an unobstructed manner.  Of course, you'd
probably want to pick up replacement gaskets/washers for the manifold/
head joints, so there is some reason to not want to do that.

If you've got a doghouse cooler, you could undo the relatively loose
bits of tin on the front of the engine and look at things from that
end, as well (with the engine out).
