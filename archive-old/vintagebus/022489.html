&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;         I've been seeing this Bus parked on Del Paso Blvd. and Globe
&gt;Ave. in Sacramento, It has the Hatch and I guess It is derivable since I
&gt;don't see it parked there all the time.  Anyone on the list own it?
&gt;Just curious.

I've seen it too.  One night I was driving by and I honked; there was a guy
working on a car inside the shop, and he looked up, but didn't wave.
