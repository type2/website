&gt; ok, so im cheap... before i shell out a hundred clams for the rear hatch
&gt; seal, anyone ever use any other weatherstripping to seal it up?
&gt; I thought i saw a cheap alternative at The Bus Depo once, anyone?


The genuine VW seal (for '64-up) is $85 and made by VW/Brazil. Same
size/shape/consistency as the German one, although the color matching of the
three sections that are glued together to make up the seal is a bit off (one
section is a bit darker than the other three). This is the same seal that
some others are selling as &quot;German,&quot; as they are not aware that VW/Germany
in fact sources the seal from VW/Brazil.

I also have a Mexian aftermarket one for $39.  It is not as accurately
molded as the VW one; i.e. the corners are not properly squared off, etc.
Also the rubber is a bit softer.  Is it comparable to the VW one?  No.  If
you were doing a serious resoration, I'd stick with the genuine one.  Will
it last as long as the VW one?  Again, probably not.  Will it do a decent
job sealing your hatch, better than either a generic length of weatherstrip
or the half-rotted seal you have now?  Definately.
