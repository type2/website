yes- once I made the dumb mistake of selling a motor to a guy and accepting a 
promise of payment later.  After a period of time and a number of phone calls 
and unfufilled promises I reposessed the motor.  He had put locks on his 
engine compartment.    It took a couple minutes to get around that.

Re keys, a friend accidently left his keys in his ignition when he locked his 
bus.   One of the keys on my keyy ring opened his driver sdoor.  No other 
locks, just that one.  Even though all teh locks worked with the same correct 
key.  I think the drivers door lock gets the more use and wears more than the 
others, so keys of similar cut will often work.

Yes drilling out messed up screws is a pain  :(.   Pour e^tre beau, il faut 
suffiert  (sp?)
...............
Now we know who the devious individual is who gets into our locked engine 
compartments.

What an obvious and smart way of checking things if you lose you engine key! 
But I think you have to remove both rear lights and a second hand available.

BTW I can't get the latch mechanism off, to replace the hole cover.One of the 
Phillips head screws is completely stuck and I have to drill it out.
