Subject: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003011204350.11376-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hello all,

Last time i was at my flaps i asked about 64-70 brake cylinders.  they had
german (didnt even ask) brazillian for now $25?? and taiwan made for the
old $10 per or so...

Now, the guy at the counter, a friend of mine said the brazilian supply
has dried up/prices gone up since varga got bought out.

Anyway, the brazillian ones looked nice.  The casting looked nice,
head and shoulders above indian brake cylinders i have installed (just
two, but never agaoin if i can help it.) the bores looked well polished
to my untrained eye.  An interesting tidbit was that the piston was
anodized! gold colored even...  This seems to be a good thing as standard
pistons can pit after water exposure, but anodized aluminum does not for
all intents and purpouses.

So now i must ask...

anyone seen/used these in person and have an opinion?

thanks,

Steve
