&lt;&lt; I took off the belt as some folks suggested and the noise didnt stop. I 
did 
 find that the center section of my pully was about gone and replaced it.
     Also, in search of the root of this sound and because I prefer to adjust 
 my valves and change axle boots sitting upright rather than on my back, I 
 will be pulling the engine soon. Anything I should do while its out? I plan 
 on replacing the fuel line                                                   
 
           and tighting everything down, what else should I look for/replace?

since the whirring did not stop when you removed the fan belt, it is highly 
unlikely that the noise has to do with your alternator/ fan.

Is your lower (crank)pulley rubbing on the tin there?

have you lubed the cam in the distributor that the points ride on?   If dry  
it  will wear down the bit on the points that rides on thedist cam, messing 
up your points adjustment and also making a noise

Personally I would not pull the motor just to adjust the valves
