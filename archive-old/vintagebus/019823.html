Subject: stephen wright selling parts?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id TAA04289

remember the comic stephen wright...pretty funny guy, with great quirky
one-liners. I specifically remember on where he looks down at his shirt...then
kind of has this lost expression and looks around and says...&quot;I lost a button
hole&quot;.

relevance to vw bus list:

someone is selling holes on vwplante classifieds:
&quot;These are Bus pop out window holes taken out of a 1967 VW Bus, these fit
1951-1967 VW Buses, add a window to your Bus or use 1 for repair, the have the
hinge in each hole, $45 ea hole&quot;

how exactly do you sell a hole?
