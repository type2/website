&lt;&lt; I was just wondering when if at all taillights had amber lenses. I'm
 talking about turn signal portion here. Was it only available in Europe?
 Asking because I want to redo mine and would want to set it up as close
 to European stock as possible. Thanks for any advice.

62 and later, the wiring was also slightly different.   N.  Am spec included 
red taillights, no amber.   yes, the euro buses had them.

also the no overriders on euro buses, the deluxe trim is longer on euro bus' 
bumpers

they also had sekurit windsheilds (break your head on them you can)

seemed they all came with steering/ignition locks

also, they kept the pointy turn signal up front till what 63,  semaphores 
were used through 59 or 60 

speedo in km
