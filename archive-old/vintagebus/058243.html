List, in case anybody is looking for an early early crewcab-two earlys, not
one, I just listed mine 
on the samba.  Can I provide a quick link to it?  No, I'm not that computer
literate, but if you've been 
looking for a very complete early crewcab, I suggest you consider this one,
tilt and hoops included.
Easiest way to get to it is by typing in my e-mail address under
search-ben.cooley_at_airgas_dot_com.
I will have pictures ready on wednesday.


Best regards to all
