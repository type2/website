&lt;&lt; There was a hole in the body of the carb facing me!  I found a plug lying 
on the tin by the fanbelt and put it back in.  What is this hole and can the 
plug come out again? It had no threads, just went in with a push from a 
screwdriver. &gt;&gt;
Hi Sam,
It is a freeze type of plug.  Slightly domed, but when installed by punching 
in it speads slightly to completely fill the area.  Though you need to use a 
sealant to seal it completely.  Plus if it can out it can come out again.  
Probably need to mash the carb body around this plug to swedge the plug in 
place.  Eric&amp;Barb
