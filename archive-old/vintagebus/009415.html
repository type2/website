&gt; Steve and anyone else who may have had this problem....did your
&gt; accelerator stick
&gt; with the throttle open, or was it sticky trying to push the pedal down?
&gt; My accelerator
&gt; has had a &quot;catch&quot; when first applying pressure to the pedal. It seems to
&gt; release OK
&gt; and has never stuck with the throttle open, but it's annoying.

Pulling the accelerator cable and straightening the kinks in it fixed this for me.  I didn't pull the whole thing, just from the fan shroud underneath the bus.  That and a shot of Dub-ya Dee Forty on the throttle shaft bushings and no more sticky.
