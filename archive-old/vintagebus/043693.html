Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning intake manifold

All,

On the subject of cleaning intake manifold heat risers - do you often
find that one heat riser is more plugged than the other?  When I had
the heater boxes and exhaust off of my '64, I checked my heat risers -
the left one had maybe 5% carbon blockage and the right one was like
90%.  I cleaned them both out, but especially the right one.  Just
curious if this is normal or might suggest something on the right
side of my engine needing further scrutiny.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
