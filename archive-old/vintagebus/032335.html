Subject: How VW nuts are you ?
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.58.19991001095706.009625b0_at_pop.primenet_dot_com&gt;

VanBondo is only 50% VW nutty...
According to the scoring guide, your Volkswagen craziness experience level 
is: 50%
You love the Volkswagen, but it doesn't rule your life...

Hahahaha! I suspect testing error!
The test needs other questions.
Example:
1.&gt;Do you shop at used clothing stores for crappy looking Hawaiian shirts 
and skanky looking shorts so you can save up for your next engine rebuild?
~ even though all ten of your VWs have fresh engines?
~ and a few spare core motors on the shelf?
2.&gt;Do you drive with pistol shooter's ear plugs to deaden the sound because 
you are too damned busy to reinstall the interior in your EZ camper?
~ the camper was painted LAST Christmas.
3.&gt;Are you so sick in the head that you have used up all of your vacation 
days on travel to out of State VW shows?
~AND only three quarters of the year has passed?
~AND the Arizona show season is just starting?
~AND you are eye-balling your accrued sick time?
4.&gt;You threaten to name your children, not after family names, but instead 
choose vehicle makes/models? &lt;Catera, Sierra, Van, Vanna, Wes T., Judson, 
Mercedes, Truck, Edsel, Porsche, Moon Unit or Rover?&gt;
~OR auto related namesaskes? &lt;Ferry, Ben Pon, Enzo, Gene Berg, Hoover Bit, 
Kelly Park, Pomona, Irvine or Deano&gt;
~AND your spouse agrees... ;-)
