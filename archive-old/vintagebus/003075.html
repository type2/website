a few thoughts on the project from a non-engineer/scientist.
Laminar is right, you're simulating still air being hit by a 50 mph =
object, so you have to create a uniform moving mass of air. A grid would =
be best, but two sets of slats/vanes may be easier to make. Or, a bunch =
of thin-wall pipes bundled together. Length? who knows.=20
I've heard Ford engineers talk about designing the Pinto. It had less =
drag mounted backwards in the tunnel. They also attached elephant ears =
to the model with mixed results.=20
A Type 2 book (or website?) has pics of bus wind tunnel models. It shows =
a few front ends that were placed on the body of the bus.=20
Some nerds are using internet-ed idle PC's to do pieces of complex =
computations. We can take Guif's virtual Type 2's and run some tests. =
Elephant ear mirrors vs. round, safari windows, dog's head out window, =
tongue out/in, etc. Important stuff.=20
