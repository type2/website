from the scrap pile.

Thanks,

&gt;     I liked that bus you had put alot of work into it.  Keep saving them
&gt; that should be the goal here on this list to keep as many away from the
&gt; crusher as possible. If you have visited the John's web site you can see
he
&gt; is a good of metal worker to keep this one from the scrap pile. That bus
&gt; should be a show winner or in a magazine!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Keep them Running!

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;It is a sort of subset of the custom vs. stock resto schism. Though
&gt; it seems that the stock resto freaks get a fair share of dissing (you'll
&gt; hear
&gt; &quot;vintage nazi&quot; a lot for anyone who is not pro custom), not just the folks
&gt; who make a DD slammed sunroof panel dressed up tart out of what had once
&gt; been
&gt; a decent honest working bus.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        I normally try and just brush off all the comments I have gotten
from
&gt; the list, but am tired of the narrow minded, uninformed &quot;opinions&quot; many
&gt; people seem to form about a bus they know VERY little or nothing about.
Let
&gt; the record show, I have NEVER dissed on anyone's VW project or bus on this
&gt; list.
&gt;
&gt;        I beg to differ about the shape of my bus before I started it.
This
&gt; bus was bought, for $400, from Lavere's, and was minus ALL it's parts, and
&gt; very rusty, with the wrong doors, gas tank, no engine lid, nice toyota
high
&gt; back seats up front, welded down!!, no side windows, no engine, had a HUGE
&gt; hole cut in the roof, and all the supports running side to side had been
&gt; hacked out, I am not mentioning all the rust that was ALL the way through
&gt; the
&gt; rain gutter, and bondo'ed over, and the 200 hundred holes drilled over the
&gt; last 40 years or so, which I refer to as home improvements.  That is a
much
&gt; better description of the original shape of my bus, not a &quot;decent honest
&gt; working bus&quot;.  My bus stoped being a decent honest working bus MANY
decades
&gt; before I saved it.  Not many people would have taken the time, money, or
&gt; effort to do ANYTHING with this bus.  Please try and not diss me for
SAVING
&gt; another VW from the crusher.  And I have saved my fair share.
&gt;        Take a look at Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz I built.  A lot of people had
&gt; plenty to say about me building my bus (bad stuff), but VERY few stood up
&gt; and
&gt; said &quot;hey good job on Dans bus&quot;.  I think if you look at the pictures,
&gt; you'll
&gt; also agree again, not many would have fixed and saved that bus the way I
&gt; did!
&gt;        Not to diss anyone, but if the issue of my bus is the donor bus
parts
&gt; from other buses, I have seen pics of &quot;hoopty buses&quot; that were cut up that
&gt; actually ran and drove.  Nothing I cut up was ever gonna be restored!
&gt; Infact
&gt; I didn't even cut them, I bought the parts via the internet, from people
&gt; just
&gt; like all of you!!!
&gt;        Can we stop beating this dead horse!  We all have our own way of
&gt; building our VW's.  Can we all just let each other enjoy VW's as a whole
no
&gt; matter how we build them!
