Subject: re: belt broke / ouch hot gen?

Hi Andy:
Generators do depend on air from the shroud for cooling.  If the wrong
tinware is used it is possible, I suppose, to not get sufficient flow for
cooling.  I'm not sure without looking at a generator, but I  _think_  that
the brush covers are supposed to be there to keep dookie outta the brush
assembly.  Therefore the flow exits the rear of the generator around the
pulley.  Hmmm - a pulley with vanes to help draw the air through - Honey can
I buy a milling machine?

&quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued
by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well
for themselves.&quot;
