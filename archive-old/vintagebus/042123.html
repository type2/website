&gt; whether to use the standard lap belt or a 3-point harness.  I have read

Are you talking about a full over-shoulder harness? (which would generally
mount to a rearward point._dot_usually a back seat bolt hole in a normal
car..)

Or are you talking about a standard 3 point shoulder-strap seat belt?

If you really are refering to harness i would HIGHLY not suggest it.  with
such an unsupportive lowback seat as a bus has, I can forsee serious back
injury in an accident..not to mention the potential illegality for street
use. (a harness doesnt allow you to move. In most cars you have to
unharness to change radio stations...in a bus you'd probably have to
unharness to hit 3rd gear!)


If a normal belt, I'd suggest checking the archives again. There has been
much talk about this.  The biggest concern is that the B pillar is not
designed to support the pull from a belt, and withouth proper
reinforcement the bolt woult pull our, or the entire pillar would bend in
a crash....leaving you with a useless shoulder belt.  And depending on the
belts design, possibly a useless lap-section as well.

my few cents.
