Subject: downshifting problems
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id MAA90669

My bus seems to shift fine while accelerating, but when i go to slow down, and
try to down shift, awful grinding noises, and the shifter is often difficult
to move into the lower gear.

I have recently changed(about 6-8 weeks ago) my transmission oil and rear gear
box oil to a GL-4 that i got from a jiffy lube type place. Last fall i had a
rear wheel bearing start leaking on me, and when the mechanic refilled it(i
was on the road and unprepared to change this), he refilled the boxes and the
transmission with a GL-4/GL-5 transmission fluid. After reading a bunch of
posts saying that this was not a good idea, i drained and replaced with the
straight GL-4. This work was done at a VW dealer/mechanic.

Has anyone had a similar problem...any suggestions
