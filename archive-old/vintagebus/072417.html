Murals of Jerry Garcia, on the camper--
Why would we all want to look the same ? That's Boring !!  Wearing tye-dye in a bus, i would agrue, lends you to &quot;look(ing) the same&quot; it's like going to a Lead Sled show with a white t-shirt and pomade in your hair thinking you're an individual that stands out! Both are the expected &quot;uniforms&quot; for those scenes. I find it refereshing to see a nice bus without any reference to the dead plastered all over it, how played out is that?  --But LOTS of other people as we cruise on down The
Golden Road--  Me too and all I have are travel decals and asolid stock paint job on mine. I guess that's not too boring if people are waving to me as well.
