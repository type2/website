&lt;&lt; Hello everyone.
      The other day I bought a '67 bus.  The breaks need work, and I thought
 it would be a good idea to replace everything to do about the breaks.  What
 all would be required to do a complete break replacment?
 
 Thanks,
 Stuart &gt;&gt;

See what happens when you break your brakes :-))
