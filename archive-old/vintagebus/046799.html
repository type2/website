Subject: Truck bed section
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi All,
   I know I've asked before about a small section of truck bed (approx 1x2ft) 
solid rib pattern and can have surface rust. Nothing has materialized as of 
yet and the weather is showing signs of wanting to warm up (outside Chicago). 
I have almost everything I need to start to put the 57 singlecab back 
together (no ambo fan yet/center brakelight). Its almost ready for paint, I 
just need the section to fix my bed and about 25 more degrees. 
                                                         Steve 57
