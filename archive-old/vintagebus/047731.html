&gt;ever hear of the british carb called the fish? not a 4/1/99 joke!
&gt; manufactured or sold in the USA by a guy named Brown (lost all info on
&gt;this )
&gt; this carb has multi fuel capacity by  rotating the metering tube on the
&gt;throttle shaft for infinitely variable fuel metering (Fuel- air mixture
&gt;is dispersed through jets on the throttle shaft ) the only problem with
&gt;this carb that i have heard about is icing up, not a problem on Oahu :-)


the fish carb was reviewed in the April-May 1959 issue of foreign car giude.
It was reported that the carb not only improved acceleration, but also raised
gas mileage.  The carb cost $42.50 back then and included the carb, adaptor
base and linkage.  There is too much info in the article to type in.  I do
not have a scanner, is there any specific information you are looking for?
