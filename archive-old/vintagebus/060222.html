Subject: rhino liner


&gt; I have line-x, a similar product in my toyota. I have been very happy with
&gt; it and wish I would have had it in the 68 sc. Lifetime warranty. I highly
&gt; recommend it, Its a nice non skid surface the dogs can actually stand on
&gt; when you take the corner. It would be nice in the belly box too.
&gt;     I have seen some trucks that had a few wood strips that sort of
matched
&gt; the bed slats down the inside of the gates. Looked cool, but probably not
as
&gt; functional as diamond plate or something similar. I often thought of
&gt; reinforcing my gates with angle iron at the top and bottom edge and
diamond
&gt; plate or something to cover the inner face. they where kinda bowed when I
&gt; bought it and they where pretty beat up by the time I sold it.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone out there had the bed of their truck done with Rhino Liner?
&gt; &gt; I'm not gonna be going stock, so considering it as an option.
