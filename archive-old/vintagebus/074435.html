Subject: Re: [VB] bus manual best source also old ads

The best best manual is teh 63 VW Transporter Workshop Manual, which was published back in teh day.   It is reprinted by Bentley, and id often called &quot;the Bentley Manual&quot; on this list.  Covers 63-67 buses.   It has all the wierd bus stuff and lots of lovely pics.   Costs more, but worth it.  :) Dark blue cover.   

Also get an idiot book by John Muir, available at any used/new bookstore worth its salt.  Cheaper,  for all acVWs.

&gt; I need to buy a shop manual for my 67 bus- simple
&gt; Is there just one shop manual, because some wording of 
&gt; advertising gets 
&gt; me confusedthat there may be 2.
