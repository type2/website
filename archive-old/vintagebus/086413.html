Subject: OCTO Meet (Huntington Beach) Shopping list

Hi All,

I want to thank all who responded to my questions about quieting down my
bus.  I will be looking for a stock muffler at the OCTO meet next weekend.

This list has been a fantastic education.

I have purchased all of the suspension and brake pieces from a Porsche 944
to convert my 1967 to ball joint, IRS and disk brakes.  I've also read a
good deal about the conversion.

I will be looking for a narrowed ball joint front beam.  Does anyone else
have any experience with this conversion?  Wagonswest has a narrowed front
beam for $650.  I could probably do the welding myself, but I don't know how
one goes about shortening the front torsion bars.  Are there any other
options?

Again, thanks for the entertainment and the education.  My goal is to go
camping with my daughter before she thinks I'm not cool enough to hang out
with.  My ex doesn't think I've chosen a &quot;suitable&quot; vehicle, so I figured
I'd call it a Porsche with a VW body!

Clark

Wish list for OCTO:
Stock muffler
67 blinkerlight relay
Narrowed ball joint front beam
12V bulbs for my gauges
Gas tank to body seal
Driver's side door striker
Westfalia curtain rollers for the front curtain
Hydrogen-powered rocket motor
