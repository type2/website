The new type 1 beetles cost a little over 8000.00 dollars in Mexico now. You
can go to the dealer and buy one if you have Mexican Citizenship or a
residence in Mexico. There was a time when they were 6500.00 for the City
model (carbureted engine) or 7500.00 for the Classico model, FI, alarm, AC
and chrome hubcaps. They have discontinued the City model and currently only
make 1 model, kind of half way between the City and Classico. If you go to
Nogales Mexico, you can pop in at Beetlemex's conversion shop and watch them
transform new beetles to early pans to bring in the U S. You could probably
buy your F I engine from them there also, though I haven't heard of them
selling F I engines. There is one company in the U S that imports both the
turn key carbureted and the Turn key F I engines, but then again I haven't
seen them with any F I engines as of late, only the turn key carbureted
models. Again these are Beetle engines and NOT bus and there is a
difference. I tore down a Beetlemex and a VW Mexico replacement engine and
they have different pistons. The Beetlemex were flat top and the OE VW
engine has the low compression dished pistons. The other difference was in
the valve size. The Beetlemex engine had larger valves then the OE VW
engine.

I am told by my Mexican roommate that a brand new Mexican air-cooled beetle
costs around $4000 U.S. in Mexico.( a lot cheaper than the 13,000 those
importers ask for the new ones on old pans!) it seems logical that buying a
powerplant there for one would have to be less than the $1200 companies
charge here just for the long block. i would bet that a case would cost
around 100-150 bucks there especially since places like JC whitney sell them
for about 300, typical markup is 100% so 150 seems responsible. i have
driven
a new beetle and i was amazed by the performance of that engine. its also
equipped with a catalytic converter so i'd feel less bad about driving a
stink pot., modern fuel injection, electronic ignition, hydraulic lifters,
spin on oil filter, makes my mouth water.  THese engines supposedly meet us
smog requirements, safety issues are all that hold the beetles over the
border.
