&gt; Actually, the old man did have a pickup truck.
&gt; He used it to carry around radio parts.

&gt; It was a later truck, Like a 64 or so, same logo on the side.
&gt; Similar atleast, its been a while since I saw the pictures.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Um, would radio stuff be transported in a pickup?  Doesn't make sense...

As I recall, the TV repairman (played by Don Knotts) in the movie
&quot;Pleasantville&quot; transported some very whiz-bang TV parts in his singlecab!
Perhaps the logo from it is the one you're looking for! :)
