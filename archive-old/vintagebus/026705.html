Subject: Brake tool; New Bus Dog!

Today I got my new brake tool from RMMW. It is a wrench with a 6 point
7mm box on one end, an 11mm flare nut wrench on the other end, with a
couple of offsets in the middle. It is made by K-D, looks very well
made. The package looked like it had been hanging on the shelf for
awhile... I can't wait to try it out!

A couple of weeks ago I got myself my very own bus dog! A lot of bus
owners I've met at camp-ins had dogs (most very well mannered), and I
wanted one, too... His name is Dante. He is a well-mannered, 11 month,
100 lb. Rott. He was with my brother-in-law Dave at Everybus as a small
puppy (so he's experienced). He loves to ride in the bus! Glad I have a
bench seat, 'cause he's too big for a bucket...
