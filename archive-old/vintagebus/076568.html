Subject: RE: [VB] Beetle tranny on reduction boxes ?

Jamie
Well this is how I did it, well Gary Zink at Gary's Transaxles in Kent,
WA did it. The core swing axle tranny from a 72 Super beetle has a 3.875
Ring and Pinion. The gears used were: 1st  3.78 2nd  2.058 3rd  1.217
4th  0.821 I use both a type 4 oil cooler and a remote cooler as is was
getting hot during the summer. The remote cooler though does not have a
fan on it. I also switched to a smaller top pulley. Couldn't be happer
with the setup now. Shawn

Shawn,
I am very interested in how you did this.  I have a 1904cc also and want
to transplant it from my '71 to my '60 DD.  Do you run hot?  70 mph at
2700 RPMs seem like the fan would not be moving fast enough for cooling.
Thanks
