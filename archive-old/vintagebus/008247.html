&gt; down)?  They both seem to work, but when both are used with the two
&gt; different gauges(one new, one old) they both read reverse and only half
&gt; full.  They do work within this range though.(giving me a broad idea
&gt; about my gas situation).  Has ANYONE gone through all this?    My bus is

Yes! I have the same problem. My original gas gauge died. I have a 12v. VDO
gauge, which matches the other gauges, so I installed it. When wired
correctly (I think) the needle stays on zero. When wired backwards, the
needle says empty when full, slightly above 1/2 when empty. This can make
for some unpleasant surprises. Maybe I'll try to get a stock 6v. gauge.
