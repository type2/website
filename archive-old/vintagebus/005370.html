Attention all you trivia buffs out there. VW Howard is having a 30 question
Trivia contest at Buses By the Bridge. The semaphore year was one of them
but has now been replaced with a harder question. I think you guys are going
to be hard to fool, but I think I do have some stumpers. All the questions
and answers were taken from a very popular Volkswagen Bus book. Custom
BBBIII beer mugs will be the prizes (1st and 2nd) . Free contest open to all
who attend BBBIII.  Don't forget the Boy Scout ALL YOU CAN EAT PANCAKE
BREAKFAST Sun. morning, only $3.00 per person. If you want an event flier
email me or Ronnie your mailing address and we will mail one to you.
Hope to see you in Havasu!
John VW Howard
