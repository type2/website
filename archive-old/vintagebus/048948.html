Listees:

I have been doing research out the yin yang on tilts and bows.  Here's the straight dope as of December 10, 1998:

1) Whether it be a Single Cab or Double Cab, there are only TWO bows, not four as someone posted earlier.  There are also two bow caps that sandwich the longitudinal wood members to the bows (maybe where he got the four).  The only other piece is for a Single Cab which is basically a piece of flatstock steel that screws down into the wood at the center point between the two outer bows.  It's shaped similar to the caps but only flat, the caps have a curved edge to wrap around the wood ends.  Hard to describe but easy to see.

2) DG - Derrick Gregg is no longer making bows.  I spoke with Derrick at length 8 weeks ago and pleaded with him to continue making the bows.  I had heard from several sources, including Matthew Henricks, that his bows were very nice quality and affordable.  I believe around $300 for the set.  He said no way, he was tired of making them, too much work.  When he was making them he would wait until he had enough orders to do 6 sets at a time.  I also asked Derrick if he'd sell me the jig that he had made so that I could start making bows myself.  He never returned my phone call so I took that as a no.

I've been researching making the bows and have yet to come up with an affordable way of doing it.  I will be meeting with a very knowledgeable 75 year old foundry owner over the Christmas holidays to see if he can help me in fabricating bows.  There seems to be a big need out there for them, plus I need four sets, so I'd really like to answer the call.  As with most of my crazy projects, I'm not in it to make a bunch of money but rather provide something that bus owners need and can use, but must cover my costs and some of my time.  If I can come up with a way to make sets for under $400 then I'm going to do it.  Otherwise I'll just keep hitting the swaps.  My other concern is that I'll only make the bows if they will end up looking as close to original as possible.  It would be simple to make something that will hold up the tilt, but for me that's just not good enough.  They'll need to look original.

If anyone wants Derrick's phone number pmail me.  Maybe if enough of us show interest he'll start up production again.  Also, I have two sets of original bows, one SC set and one DC set.  If someone needs info or pics to try and get an idea of what they look like I'll try and get something to you that will help.  Please, no bow kickers tho.  I barely have enough time to ship out the 50 orders of bed slats I get everyday.  NOT! :)

Peas.

Robert
