Well' how big are the trucks in Fresno?


Apparently not big enough.  It's still sitting there.  It's been a month =
now and if I hadn't sent my money, I would have gone with another company=
.  Stay away from Hurst Auto Transport.  I hope to have better luck this =
week.  Ohio vintage is coming up and I will be w/o bus if not. :(
