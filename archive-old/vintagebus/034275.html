&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 After letting the 62 sit for a couple weeks,
 I thought I'd better fire it up and take her around the
 block a few times. It's got a fairly new battery (3 mos), but
 it was deader than a doornail. I figured out that I had
 left the radio on the last time I drove it, so It's been 
 suckin juice for about 2 weeks. Now it doesn't want to
 take a charge (6v _at_ 6amp). Is this battery toast??
 Can it be serviced?? Or should I take it back and play 
 dumb? BTW does everyone else's radio stay on when 
 the key is off? Never had a VW with a radio that worked
 so I'm not sure if it is wired right.
  &gt;&gt;

wierd- the battery should take a charge even if you left the radio on.

I believe the original radios were wired so they could be turned on w/o 
theignition on.

I put my music in that way so I can play music while parked w/o leaving the 
ignition on, but some people prefer to have it hooked up to the other fuse so 
only works while ignition on.   I guess you could hook it up so it only works 
with the headlights on if you want.
