No, they only coat the outside. You should have whatever stuff you need
welded to the boxes (header ends) if necessary, and they should be fairly
neat but don't have to be stripped - they do that there. Only the outside
is done. more...&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; For a header the full dip is the way to go as moisture is contained on the
&gt; inside of the header in the form of condensation when the motor starts to
&gt; heat up.

If you want guaranteed inside outside coating on the header, contact

I used them on my header in 1994 and it still looks great 8 years later.
