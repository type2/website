  Nevertheless, Ivan Hirst, Heinz Nordhoff and importers 
like Ben Pon still had to overcome a strong negative 
perception of Volkswagen in order to sell cars. Those 
first beetles that were sold to the British army had 
come from the same factory that produced V-1 rocket 
bombs, which had rained down on Britain a just a short 
time earlier. It was easy for people at the time to look 
at the beetle and Bus and relate it to unpleasant 
vehicles like Kubelwagen and Schwimwagen that shared 
some parts and designs.
  As I said, it makes their tenacity and achievments 
that much more impressive.

&gt; The Post-War &quot;VW&quot; is not the same company as the Pre-War KDF factory.
&gt; 
&gt; I highly recommend getting one of the better VW books and reading up
&gt; on the history; some of the Keithe Sueme books have a really good 
&gt; chronology.  Specifically look for the names &quot;Ivan Hirst,&quot; 
&gt; &quot;Heinz Nordhoff&quot; and &quot;Ben Pon&quot;

&gt; &gt;   It makes me realize just how successful Volkswagen was 
&gt; &gt; to be able to sell cars to countries it had waged war 
&gt; &gt; against just a few short years earlier.
