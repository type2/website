For another one of my hobbies (Vintage John Deere Tractors) I uses JB weld 
to fill cracks and missing sections of the steering wheel.  Then sand then 
paint.   Haven't had any problems with the JD wheels, I would give that a 
try on a VW one.

Hope that helps,
Mike

falling off 1966 bus steering wheel?  I was planning to get some bondo fill
it in and sand then paint it up.  Would this be a waste of time?  All help
