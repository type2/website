&lt;&lt; Is there a way to test a regulator without the use of a generator? &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Not really.  You would have to build a electronic contraption that would 
simulate the voltage and amperage of a generator for the specific regulator.  
Which would be beyond our capabilities right now without schooling in the 
electronic field.
