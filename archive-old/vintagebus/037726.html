&gt;eveytime i've tryed to short cut a PITA job i wound up &gt;haveing to fix something that wasn't broke


I agree, but offer a couple of possible easier solutions that have been successful for me.

#1 Good old fashioned caustic, kill the salmon oven cleaner, and a stiff wire brush and a good scraper. spread out a tarp, that you can through away, you'll need two or three cans, and don't directly spray it on the wiring, let it soak, as long as overnight, once you get all the gunk off as good as it will come, throw the tarp away, wipe it down as best as you can with 5+ roles of paper towels, then rinse like hell with your garden hose.

#2 not has good, but it worked ok was a foaming citrus cleaner that i got from a detail shop.

#3 the best, in my opinion, sandblasting, pay someone the 100 or so bucks, save your back, your lungs, the salmon.
