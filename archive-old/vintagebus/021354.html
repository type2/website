Subject: Re: [VB] more tire pressure

any idea what appens if you runs tires at pressure greater than reccommended?

the tire wear on the rear of my 61 indicates (by wear at edges) that they are 
underinflated- while they have been at 40psi  (for years) when the 
recommended max is 35.  What if I bump it up to 45psi?  Are these things 
going to burst on me?  ya i know I should buy new tires that are better 
reinforced etc, but still, the question still remains.  and no one says they 
have P205/75 R15 in a LT-   and one tire guy I asked was saying certain tires 
are LT when they did not say it in the line stamped on the tire?  what gives? 
 Is this a load of horse hockey?  What above 80 ratio tires- or is I get euro 
size is that ratio 82% or something?  How do I know it is euro sized?  What 
does the P mean?  If I am going to dump $300 or $400 bucks on tires I want to 
get the right  goods.   The amount I pay for powder coating and new tires 
will be more than I paid for the bus.  geez.  What if I get real tall 195s?  
I don't care what size the bus came with (no 185/75/15s please), I care about 
ground clearance, what it does with these tires, and with this gearing the 
205 75 15s give good freeway/hill climbing loaded.   God, I can't believe I 
am writing on a tire thread, how boring.  bla bla bla.  Why don't I go knit.  
Or go to the dump and use their scales to see the rear weight/ front axle 
weight/total weight of the bus.

ps safaris suck in the rain.  It's been rainy the last few days.  Watch it 
drip past that seal.  Drip drip drip.  Time to swap the windows for the 
winter I guess. No they are not FS, don't ask.
