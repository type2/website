I'm wondering if they had to shut down vintage racks out of necessity?
PIP didn't seem like that big of an operation and to be the supplier for
roof racks for the new whatever you want to call it might involve alot of
gearing up.
I assume that PIP is in business to make money and if they were offered a
contract to produce the roof racks they were surely commited to producing a
certain number or they could probably be sued.  So VW may have not directly
stopped them from making racks, but they may have had to concentrate all
their efforts on the new ones just to keep up.  I'm sure they were going to
make alot more out of the new racks than the old ones.
Does this seem likely?

John
