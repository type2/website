&gt;  Is there any way to find out what the M-Code was for a particular vehicle 
&gt; by using the VIN? Is this possible to trace...perhaps it's on the 'letter 
&gt; from the factory'.

Hi Jay,
Only by getting a letter from the factory is it possible to get a list of 
M-codes for it now.

&gt; If the title is clear and the police check comes back favorably, is there a 
&gt; problem with buying a vehicle that no longer has  an m-code plate?

Check the plate on the right forward engine compartment and check it against 
the chassi number stamped in the engine sheet metal on that diagonal piece in 
the right rear of the engine compartment just forward of the rear apron and 
left of the battery tray.  Check for any sign on the top or bottom of this 
stamped area being cut and welded into place.  If it was there is a good 
chance the bus was/is stolen!
