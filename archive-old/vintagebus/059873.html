Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

OK bud, I hear ya. No forged stuff.

One more question. If I go with larger P&amp;C's, do I run the risk of decreasing reliability and
longevity? Reason I ask is I'm thinking about maybe putting in 87's just to give me a little more
push going up hills. Good idea or not?

Kevin, Like I said before. You don't need to go &quot;forged&quot; to get your
longevity and performance. A welded CW casting and standard P/S set will do
what you want without mortgaging the house. Like everyone has been saying,
slow careful work with balanced components will spare you a lot of heartache
later. I am using a standard CIMA P/S 1641 (87mm) set with a welded CW
factory cast &quot;F&quot; crank from Berg that has been 8 doweled (my choice, you
don't really need it). My rods are factory 311 rods that have been sized,
shot peened, and balanced. The CIMA pistons were balanced for weight. I'm
using standard cast lifters, cam, (double thrust bearings) and push rods. I
reworked my rockers and rocker shafts, cleaning all oil holes, replacing the
washer stacks, and putting on swivel feet. I use a cast 30mm blueprinted oil
pump and dog house cooler. My heads are new 041 with 125lb springs and SS
intake valves. The new cylinders were hand lapped into their head position
and deck height was set at .060. I retained cooling flaps and used a new
thermostat. I am running standard exhaust and heater boxes. After 500 miles
I pulled the engine, stripped it of sheet metal, and retorqued everything. I
currently have 27000 miles on this daily work horse in my SC and I don't cut
it any slack. Like all of the engines I build, I use them but don't abuse
them.

It is currently a 1600 DP. Since I'm rebuilding it, I could go bigger but
I'm don't care much about
speed. My goal is to build an engine that will last longer than a stock
rebuild. I thought that if I
got a forged CW crank and forged P&amp;C's I could get more miles out of it.
True or no?
