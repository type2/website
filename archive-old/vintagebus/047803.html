Before anyone starts crying in their (German) beer, this thing has as big a 
hole in the floor as it does in the roof.  Rocker rust is about knee high.  
Not a candidate for restoration unless you last name is Gates, Rockefeller or 
Fitzpatrick.  8-)

Roof section, sunroof mechanism, skylight glass are already spoken for by a 
friend.  No middle seat.  Everything else is up for grabs.

I have yet to take a complete inventory but it appears almost everything is 
there.

Jail bars
Rear seat jail bar
rear seat
Belt line trim
12V clock
12V gas gauge
Radio
**BLUE** front and rear mats - (will only be sold to someone with a '66-7 Sea 
blue deluxe.  When I had a Sea blue '66 Dlx I couldn't find these anywhere.)

Pmail me if interested and I will try to put together a complete list with 
prices.

Thanks,
Dan
