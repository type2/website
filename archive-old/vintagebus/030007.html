Just for reference, the numbers on our 59 ddr w/t all match.  After a camper
conversion in 65 and a rescue in about 85 our engine plate was off but we
have it.  It appeared to be held on with screws.  The one behind the
passengers seat is riveted on (and painted.)

  We ended up with a vehicle with swapped titles once, took a bit to work it
out but it was worth it for us since ours was restored and the other one was
close to parts.  Maybe the PO accidentally swapped plates and it can be
cleared up with the PO.

  Maybe the PO was not being honest and there could be a salvage title or
something similar for your state.  What state are you in?

Good luck
