The Arizona Bus Club would be happy to donate some t-shirts to your 
&quot;Volkswagen Odyssey&quot; raffle.  Is this the proper address to send them to?

Omaha VW Club
4974 Corby St
Omaha NE 68104-4467

In fact, while at the Tillman's place this weekend, working on the Jerome 
Jamboree raffle bus, we thought it might be a good idea to see if any other 
bus related clubs out there would be interested in swapping some t-shirts 
that could be used for raffle prizes or whatever. If there is any interest in 
this, please e-mail me and we'll work something out.  We have a few Jerome 
Jamboree event shirts from last year, as well as some club shirts, both 
tie-dye and solid colors.
