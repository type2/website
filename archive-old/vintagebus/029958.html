Subject: What a Load

Got back a little while ago from a trip out to the Ojai Valley and came back
with a LOAD in the '60 double cab.
The truck was loaded with a complete Chevy 350 Vette engine with all the
trimmings, a transmission, two engine stands, a large cart and other assorted
items.  All total about 800+ lbs.  This is the biggest load I've had in the
truck since the engine transplant.  I have to say, the only time I knew that it
was loaded, was with the additional breaking time that I had to allow with the
weight.  It just pulled up the hills and at no time did I have any trouble with
it.  About 240 miles round trip and well worth going out there.

No, the engine is not going into the double cab, the 2L type IV is just fine
thank you.  The 350 is for my jag.  I'll leave the westfailure distinction to
Kyle. :-))

Happy Friday &amp; Happy Holidays,

Scott
