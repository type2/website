Subject: Brought another one home + parts....

Well I brought home another bus today. This is the '59 that I 
mentioned earlier in the week. It turns out it's a '59 original 
safari window Standard. It was delegated to parts bus status for 
whatever reason. So it's missing a lot of the little stuff. It does 
have what appears to be the original small nut tranny set-up. Front 
end and steering box is there as well. The funny thing is I could 
have bought this bus for $75 a few years back, but passed on it and 
bought that POS orange/white parts bus that I talk about every now 
and then. So this fella came in behind me and bought it. He pulled a 
cargo door, engine lid, and apron off for his double cab pick-up. I 
was able to scramble up an engine lid and apron, but it still needs a 
cargo door. It's got ALL of the glass and it's all good. The 
exception is of course the glass that would be in the cargo door as 
well as the safari windows. Yeh, their LONG gone. Oh yeh, the 
driver's side cab glass is toasted.

This bus is by far straighter and has less rust than the damn '59 
Kombi I've been working on forever. In fact, I think it's straighter 
right now without doing anything to it than my &quot;finished&quot; Kombi is! 
It's got the original paint and there is NO bondo or body repair 
anywhere. There are some spots of surface rust. Not much though. And 
the only cancer is two small holes in the passenger side rocker. 
Amazing. The nose has one very small crease at the tip of the &quot;v&quot; and 
that's it. It's the straightest nose I've personally seen on an 
un-restored bus.

It's crazy to me that this bus was turned into a parts bus. The 
mechanics will most likely need a really good going over, more so 
than my '59 Kombi. But the body is choice...at least for the amount 
of $$$ of got in it. (I've got basically NOTHING in this bus)

Now, it doesn't end there. I got a bunch of parts with the bus. A 
couple of middle seats, a couple of sets of 15&quot; wheels, bumpers, 3 
saphire I radios....all kinds of stuff.

At this point, I'm open to selling most everything that I put 
pictures of. If you see something you want, just email me an offer. 
If you want to see pictures of the bus and parts, go here:

Keep in mind that it's the orignal paint and has been sitting outside 
and not driven for at least 20 years. And I really don't want to cut 
the bus up at this point. I think I'm gonna try to get it on the 
road, or sell it to someone who wants to do the same.

I need some help identifying some parts that were in it. You experts 
can help me out. Here's the URL to go straight to those pictures:

Now...the coolest thing of all. On the way home I stopped in a small 
town to take a pitstop and a nice dressed southern gentlemen walked 
over to me and asked me if I wanted another one of those old vans. Of 
course I said (very calmly) &quot;Sure&quot;. It turns out his mother-in-law, 
who is in her 80's has one at her place. Back in the 60's or 70's, 
some &quot;hippies&quot; were driving through town and their van broke down. So 
they just left it. He said when he was younger he fiddled with it and 
got the engine to start, but he could hear the rod knocking right on 
top. So that was it. It's sat ever since. He called his wife and 
asked her if her mom would wanna get rid of &quot;that old hippy van&quot;. She 
said yeah. So we exchanged numbers. I'm gonna try to find it and 
check it out in the next few days. He said that it looked like the 
one on my trailer, but it didn't have that third window. So I'm 
thinking maybe it's a panel converted to camper or something like 
that. We'll see.

More later.
