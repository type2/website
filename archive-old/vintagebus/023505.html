Through a coincidence, I have met someone who is looking for a pair of long

axles for their lowered Bus to exchange for a set of big-nut '66

axles/brakes/etc..  On my '54 Single Cab, which has a Bug tranny and rear

end conversion done by the PO, I just happen to have these items.  I would

prefer to return to the stock reduction box configuration so I wish to do

the swap.  The Bug rear end in there is of the small-nut variety.



Because I still have the complete Barndoor front-end, do I need to be

concerned with the brakes/axles/etc. I use in the rear?  I assume the '66

big-nut brakes are larger.  Will this be problematic?  I know I must change

spring plates as well since the Barndoor ones are still on there.



Also, given a similar year, say '65, does the Bug transmission nose cone

mount differently than a Bus one?  The Single Cab has a custom made mount

for the Bug nosecone (luckily the split-case mount is still fully intact in

I ever go that route).

The barndoor reduction boxes are differnt than the later 36mm splitty ones.
I have seen a later transaxle bolted in, but there was no way to mount those
funny rear lever shocks the barndoors had.    I am not sure if the spring
plates were changed (hold on to yours if you do that!   Talk about a hard to
find part!)  


The center section bolt up for the nose cone is the same for any split case
tranny- which means with you putting a tunnel case one in you need to keep the
adaptor stuff from the one you are removing.   

Brakes- well yes the brakes from a 66 bus are much bigger than the rear of a
barndoor.   The barndoor takes the same wheel cylinders on the back as on the
front of oval window bugs, and the front are barndoor only.    The brake shoes
are the same all the way round on barndoors.   So you will be putting bigger
brakes on the front than the back.  Remember that  in their infinite wisdom VW
installed a single wheel cylinder on the front of these buses.   It may be a
good thing to put smalled brake pads than the 66 type on the back, or you
really will have a messed up brake ratio front to back, which could be tricky
in an odd situation.
