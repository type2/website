&gt;I don't know if this is possible, but could the rancho tranny actually

This is supposed to be a stock '67-style tranny, so I don't think that's it.  You do raise a good point, because IIRC the symptoms didn't show up before 
I adjusted the free play.  Could be I have it too low BUT it happens *as* I'm pushing the pedal down, not at furthest travel.  So I don't see a logical 
connection between travel and this symptom.  But I'll back the wingnut off a turn and see - thanks.

At some point soon I may go ahead and yank the engine to give the clutch, release bearing, gland nut, and front seal a good squint anyway.  I've got 
a growing punchlist of things to check/fix with engine out anyway: front tin, heat exchangers, an oil leak, reinstall flaps, and clean out my preheat 
pipe (ugh).  I may do the drill &amp; weld method on the preheat pipe to get it really clean, 'cause jooking a wire in there is just such a PITA.
