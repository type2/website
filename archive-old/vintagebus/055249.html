Subject: Re: [VB] clunking sound from fan

I reached around and, although big nut is tight as hell, I got fan to move
side to side slightly by tugging on it.  Then restarted engine and clunking
is now worse.  I guess a shim must have cracked, or I messed something up
when putting the fan back on between the gen shaft and big nut.   I guess
this means another day spent pulling motor,  yada, yada....AAArrrghhhh.  For
all the cool and handy engineering I've found on busses, this generator
replacement has really been a bugger.  Not a complaint though, just another
lesson learned.

&gt; &gt; 1.  Did I miss something in the diagnosis I've done so far?
&gt; &gt; 2.  Is there anything else to try with the engine in?
&gt;
&gt; Reach around front and try to wiggle the fan both side to side and
&gt; forward-backwards. Engine off of course. Then take the belt off and try it
&gt; again while holding the pulley. Generator/alternator bearings might be
shot,
&gt; woodruff keys wallered, nut loose, etc. Check for rags or paper towels in
&gt; the fan while you're back there. Gotta keep looking.
