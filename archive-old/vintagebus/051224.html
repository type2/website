Subject: RE: [VB] rack questions

Later racks also seem to be shorter than spits'.  I almost bought a later
rack(also full length), prior to purchasing mine from Tom Connor.  Looked
OK, although I didn't like the curves on the ends.  When bolted down, the
basket did NOT clear the curve in my roof.  Pressed the whole thing down.
You see, I put it on the car in the dark, and couldn't figure why it was
being sooo difficult to tighten down.  After all was said, and done, I
decided to wait out the proper fitting rack.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am considering buying a full length industrial roof rack
&gt; tomorrow. How do I tell if it is for a early or late model. The
&gt; zvw tag is no longer legible. I have seen racks that have the
&gt; straight side bars on the front, but this rack has them on the
&gt; side with the bent side bars facing forward. I hope this makes
&gt; sense. It does not have the horseshoe style clamps it has clamps
&gt; that are about 2&quot; wide and 6&quot; long that go from the gutter to the
&gt; threaded rod mounted on the rack. It is similar to the rack on
&gt; this green bus(almost a burn victim).
