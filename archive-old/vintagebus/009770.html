Subject: Awesome netmeeting chats

Tonight I had a wonderful time chatting with Paul Ledbetter of www.acvw_dot_com,
Courtney Hook, and Kirin Jacobsen via net meeting.  It was absolutely
awesome how good we could hear each other and chat for free and like we were
all old buddies.  For those with web cams, there's the optional video
conference mode as well!  If anyone would like to do net meeting chats with
me, let me know and we can work out a chat.  No long distance and all
windows 98 systems come with it!  :-)
