Subject: Turn Signal Switch routing??

How does the wiring harness from the Turn Signal switch typically run on
66/67's?  I know it comes down and through the groove in the Speedometer
housing.  Where does it typically route from there?  Does it go up and over
the package tray and behind the cross ways nose support?

Man it feels good, after 2+ years, to be getting this close.
