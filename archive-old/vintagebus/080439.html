Subject: Re: [VB] 2nd gear pops out - rebuild myself or have someone
  else do it?

 pull the motor and tranny yourself.  You can remove the RGBs and axles 
yourself. Idiot book and Bentley will help with that.  

then pay someone else to rebuild the center section... It takes special tools 
and skills and stuff.. I wouldn't even go there.  It's what 3-400 to get a 
center section rebuildt.

I'm treading on new turf here, so I'll ask for advice from those that
have been in my position. I find it increasingly difficult to keep my
poor SingleCab's transmission in second gear. At first, it would pop
out under deceleration, so I coasted in neutral. Eventually, it got
worse to the point where it pops out under medium acceleration or if
I hit a bump while babying second gear up to speed. It's time to
rebuild. Now I am comfortable with engine removal as well as
transaxle removal, and I do have access to whichever tools will be
necessary - however I have never torn into one before. I do live near
an assortment of VW shops that could likely complete the job, but at
what cost? It would seem that I could save myself some serious cash
by performing this operation myself. What does the list think? Smart
idea? Dumb idea? I noticed a coupla' good resources in the
Library_at_Type2. Any further recommended reading?
