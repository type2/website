Someone sent me some fantastic pictures of an engine test/rebuild stand.  The stand utilizied the part of the clutch houseing that has the starter holes and pressure plate lever.  What is the difference in the size off this part from year to year?  I can't bolt a 36hp on the same one that I could a pancake motor???

thanks for your time
