Subject: [VB] RE: Stupid door question ?- Me so solly boss

Apologies to you Jerry, I was only thinking of a bus that I had ruined a few
years ago. It just sounded too familiar to me. I never post anything that is
utterly false unless it is obviously wrapped in humor or beer induced Friday
night psychotic [ ;-0 !! ] episodes. What I wrote was true to the incident to
which I was familiar.
To give a real answer to your question, the glass, upper frame, inner and outer
door handles and basic door will still have value. Perhaps a plasma cutter and
a spare door that has damage to other than the hinge and a skilled welder would
be viable solution. In past years I paid $60. for a bare lower door shell based
on lack of availability, immediate need and specificity of a '67 only passanger
door. On the otherhand I literally gave away a set of door similar to what you
described. Value all depends on supply and demand. When the spouse demands that
I clean out the supply then I sell cheap.
Sorry if I stepped on anyones' deal. I wish that I could say that everything
was worth a straight trade for Fort Knox. If you wish for private info on
specific issues then I'd advise not posting publically to the list and failing
to include a request for pmail replies. No intention from my 20 to cause anyone
heartburn.
I'll go back to lurking...
