&gt; Hi Thomas,
&gt; If one was to use downshifting constantly one would just be increasing the
&gt; wear and tear on both the engine and tranny not only due to causing more RPM
&gt; changes in the engine, but also by reversing the wear on the parts.



I guess I better start driving like this,,,, reverse osmosis?  Wow,, If I drive
long enough,, can i &quot;reverse the wear on the parts&quot; until they are NOS again?


Confooosed in Canada!
