Subject: Re: [VB] 1953 Barndoor on Ebay

&gt;I always wondered that.  It's a waste of CPU/bandwidth to process all those
&gt;piddly-a** bids, like $12 on a twin-turbo 930 or such nonsense.

&gt;&gt;Why place the starting bid so far below the reserve?


It's a psycological tactic.  Once people start bidding, they get the Crazy
Bidder Menatality, with concentric circles spinning in their eyes,
maniacally determined to win the auction at any price.

They also fall into the Previous Investment Trap.  Any time they've already
spent searching the various auction sites, watching the auction, analysing
the item being auctioned, dreaming about what they'll do with whatever
they're bidding on, etc, etc, gets counted as invesment which will go to
waste if they don't win.

Got to go now. I've get auctions I'm watching, bids to make, bids to make,
bids, bids to make, bi bi bi bids to to ma ma ma make  [drool, stammer,
spit, hiccup, choke, roll eyes back like slot machine reels, swallow
tongue, etc, etc]...
