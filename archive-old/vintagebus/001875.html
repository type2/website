Subject: Oil cooler leak?
Date: Sat, 2 Jun 2001 21:22:14 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I finally got around to pulling the engine out of the 69 camper today to
look for the leak. I had taken it to the car wash and sprayed the
compartment down a bit last week, but still very dirty. When I pulled the
fan housing off, I thought it would be obvious where the oil was coming from
but it is not. There simply is oil everywhere! The case is covered; the tin
above the cylinders is covered. The cooler itself is amazingly clean. How
can I tell if I am on the right track? The cylinder fins are covered in
nasty oil. I would have thought my overheating episode would have burned
that off!

What does a leaky front seal look like? There was some oil in the bell
housing. Clutch was dry. The throw out bearing was being held in by only one
clip. I guess that is where that funny noise was coming from. I found the
clip in the little offset area in the housing where the starter comes into
the housing. Wonder how that got there!

On the subject of over heating, I did find some garg on the fan. Fibrous
long hair like stuff caked in oil. Not enough to cause any blockage, but I
suspect enough to slightly decrease the efficiency of the fan. Does the
&quot;Hover bit&quot; bolt on to the front (fif) of the oil cooler? If so, I found it
in pieces under the cooler, or was that some thing else important?

Any input appreciated.
