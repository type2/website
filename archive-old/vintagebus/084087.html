Subject: Hinge cover photo needed...

Hi everyone,

I'm thinking of writing a bit about the mysterious &quot;hinge covers&quot; for 
the side cargo doors on early buses in a upcoming Transporter Talk 
column.  Can anyone out there send me a nice close up shot of a factory 
installed hinge cover on a &quot;high hinge&quot; bus for possible use in the 
article?  I already have nice close ups of NOS covers and seals not 
attached to a bus.  What I really need now is your high resolution 
digital photo(s)of installed hinge covers pretty quickly, like by Monday 
night if at all possible.  Thanks for any assistance you can lend!

On the same subject, what is your personal theory on the hinges 
purpose?  I've only seen them factory installed on the forward hinges, 
anyone seen different?  Anyone ever locate part numbers for the hinges, 
seals screws, etc.?

Sorry for the short notice and thanks for your help!

Bill Bowman
