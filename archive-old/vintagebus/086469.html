Subject: Re: A New Engine.

Hey Chris,

I will concede that my mother is VERY sensitive to certain  
frequencies, enough so that she won't go to movies. She has always  
been that way, so I understand with sincere empathy that this is a  
real issue for you.

You might consider getting some nice Bose noise canceling headphones  
for the highway.

I drove my bus back and forth to college. As I drove down the  
highway, I sang songs as loud as I could. Eventually the engine noise  
sounded musical to me and I relaxed and enjoyed the ride. As the  
bikers say, Loud pipes save lives.

Conrad
