&lt;&lt; I cracked a little L shaped piece of metal that bolted to my cooler last

Hi Chad,
Yes, that is what many volks call the Hoover bit.  As our AC VWs are air 
cooled any missing pieces of cooling tin is not a good idea unless you live 
in Alaska, Norway, Siberia, or some other cool climate.  The L-shaped sealing 
bracket helps keep forced air from leaking out of the shroud before it is 
forced through the dog house oil cooler.  So it would be best if you have 
your welded up!   Eric&amp;Barb
