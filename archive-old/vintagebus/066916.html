&gt;I do have to go back in and check the connection on the high/low dimmer
&gt;it will change states sometimes when the steering wheel is being turned.

It could be that the brown wire from the switch to the dimmer relay is
grounding out somewhere.  The dimmer switch is just a momentary contact
to ground.

&gt;My brake lights would not come on, it seems 54 brings in the signal from
&gt;the brake switch and then travels out on 54f up to the turn signal, so I
&gt;disconnected 54 from the box and spliced directly onto 54f so that way
&gt;my hazards would still work (the hazard signal is generated inside the
&gt;box).

That will work.  The only difference from stock is that if you have the
hazards on and step on the brakes, the hazards will probably &quot;freeze&quot;
with all lamps on until you step off the brakes.  Inside the box, 54F
is connected to the wiper/common of a SPDT contact.  54 is connected
to the normally closed contact and 49a (the pulsing signal) is connected
to the normally open.  When the hazards are on, 54f isn't connected to
54 anymore, so stepping on the brakes has no effect.
