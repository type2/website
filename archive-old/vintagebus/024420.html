Subject: Subject: RE: Counting VWs (Friday)

Happy Friday, here's a few more for the list:

'66 Westfalia     SO-44 Daily Driver
'66 13 Window   64,000 original miles
'67 Sedan with 59 sunroof
'56 Hardtop sedan
'83 Gti

I need another garage.

I purchased the Deluxe about a month ago from an elderly gentleman in
the town I work in. I've had my eye on it for about two years, and I
bought it the same morning it went up for sale. It was originally owned
by a local church that only used it on Sundays, then Jack bought it in
'79 and only drove it around the local area. It's all original,  lotus
white, a walkthrough, 6V, 1500 sp, Stewart Warner gas heater and no
radio.

The Other Everett
