Hi everyone,
 My trip back to Portland from Tucson was very uneventful.  Total cost was $
885, 1477 miles, and two days.  The two days were a fun filled, 17 hours the
first, and 11 hours the second.  Anyone see me in  my Ryder truck and a
graffittied 23 window?  Sure got a lot of attention.  Pretty much Interstate 10
to interstate 5 all the way.  Shiesh! did I have a lot of stuff at my parents
house!  I thought I would have had a lot of extra room on the '15 foot truck,
but 12 balloon cruisers, parts boxes, a compressor, and seats pretty much
covered the floor.  Getting it to fit into my single car garage was a feat, but
it all fit nicely.  
 I have been collecting parts for about 15 or so years with the intent of fixing
up the 23 window, and when I was loading and unloading the truck I realized I
have too many parts.  My theory was having as many parts of something I need
would make restoring it a lot easier, true if the multiple parts are what you
need.   So, here is a list of things I have for sale (all items are used and are
plus shipping.):

(Note: I have shot from the hip on all prices, I have no idea what this stuff
goes for or if it even has value, therefore all are negotiable)

*full set of 21 window belt-line trim.............$80
*Never installed set of lowered spindles (Wolfgang)...........$175 (I paid 350 +
100 core that I never sent...ouch 450!)
*Two Sekurit bent corner windows.....(trade only for SIGLA BCW's - I had em but
I broke em!  :( )
*1 Symmetrical rear bumper aluminum trim (non-slashed type).........$10
*4 pcs - front bumper aluminum trim............$15ea
*4 - 15&quot; bus rims (dismounted).............$15ea
*2 sets of front window frames for driver and passenger door incl glass - need
resto all in various conditions (all need wing latches).....$40ea
*Misc. knobs.......$1ea
*Misc. jail-bar end pieces.......$5ea
*3- Post '62 bilstein jacks (bilstein in raised lettering on head) .....$10ea
*oil bath air cleaner (engine ceiling mount type).....$20
*Pop-out cargo door side step - Single door width - unrestored (foot lever
frozen doesn't work with belly pans).......Make offer? 
*Rear symmetrical (66-67) bumper blade - rough, but useable............$20
*Never used 3 year old front repro bumper from Wolfsburg west (slight surface
rust) slashed style, no over-rider's or holes...........$75
*Front bumper blade - rough, but useable .............$20
*Front bumper brackets..............$10ea
*Rear seat full length kick panel - decent shape ..........$40
*Rear apron Push button type with rare pea-shooter cuts...........$30
*Gas tank '67 (hump on top in good condition).... $30
*Pop out chrome window latches (small type not spoon)...........$10ea

I have a lot of other used stuff, so let me know what you need.  I might have it
and hell, I need the room!

And here's a list of things I need (E-mail me WITH prices, and trades always
welcome):

*Two pcs of deluxe engine louver trim pieces
*40 horse air-cleaner bracket (triangle type) I think there are two types and
I'm not sure which one I need.
*Two SIGLA skylite windows ( pref. no bubbles....bubbles hidden under rubber OK)
*Two SIGLA bent corner windows &quot;
*Stale air 40 horse fan shroud
*Decent shape original black walk through cargo area floor mat (Hey! I can
dream!)
*Two slashed style rear bumper trim pcs
*Rear apron church key type (small pea-shooter cuts OK)

 Anyone interested in a complete front beam (post - '66) drum to drum with a
torsion bar, I  left one outside by my parents well in Tucson. FREE, I'll send
you directions if interested.  I am unsure of the condition of the king-link
pins, but the torsion bar and bracketry and the drums and backing plates are a
very handy things to have extras of.  I couldn't see me lugging this around when
I didn't need it.  Maybe Dyer could use it?  Dyer ya out there?

Thanks,
George of Portland OR
