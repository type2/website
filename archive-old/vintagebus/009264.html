Hi Michael

If yours is the 14th then you should have a production date of 08/01/64 or
thereabouts? What is your date of production? Actually what is the
production date of the first SO42 Westfalia???

I am starting to think that for the '67 Model year with approx 70 made per
day: To get to May is 8 months from August 1st, x 20 working days in a
month, x 70 =11200 which is awfully close to my Fabrik No: 11101

Therefore, mine would be the 11101 SO42 Westfalia built for the '67 year and
yours would be the 14th SO42 Westfalia built for the '65 year. Remember that
the this brass tag also records the year.

Does this theory sound reasonable.....

Hi Scott-

As far as I know the brass plate that you are referrring to did indeed begin
with the So-42's. I have never seen a similar plate on so-23's, 33's 34's
etc.

And yes that farbrik number is indeed the number yours was in the whole
westfalia schema, i.e. how many had been made.

Trivia time my 65 westfalia has fabrik number 0014 making it the 14th so-42
westfalia ever made.

Michael
