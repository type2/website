another tool to use or to try would be a nut splitter or a very sharp
chisel to split it. you must align the chisel with the stud and strike the
nut on one of its sides firmly to get it to crack. often times i can get
the nut to split and either unscrew it or just peel it off the stud with no
damage to the stud itself.  one thing to be aware of is that if you use
those copper self-locking nuts is that they have a tendancy to pull studs
out of the soft aluminum heads when you try to remove the nuts the next
time.  i also have some nos/vw/german exhaust kits with steel nuts that
have a heli-coil in them.  old-time mechanics said they liked these best
because you could get the nut to come off without damaging the stud, even
when rusted, and the helicoil would stay on the stud and could be peeled
off more easily than trying to get a stubborn &quot;regular&quot; nut off.

&gt; I haven't had that problem since I started using stainless nuts, though. I
&gt; know some folks use brass nuts too. I think the main thing is to just
&gt; not use plain steel so the stud and nut don't rust together.

&gt; &gt; nut firmly attached to it. I figure that was better then breaking it
&gt; &gt; off
