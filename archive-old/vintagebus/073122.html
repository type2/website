Subject: Re: [VB] 67 camper steering column color?

Westfalia's don't necesarily follow that rule. I have a '65 Westfalia that has a white (silver beige) wheel and column. I know that this is how my bus came and I have seen a few others that are also like that. I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the color of the bus and or year of manufacture. I &quot;think&quot; most of the ones I have seen with the white color are Dove Blue.
The steering wheel horn buttons are a little more difficult to find as they are white with no wolfsburg center.
