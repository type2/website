Practice is good. As is welding with gas.  Use as small a wire as you can.
That will be .23 or .023 I can't remember.

If you are just starting out, I'd suggest you take a look at Kelly's page.
http://www.metwiz_dot_com for some pictures of how he goes about welding VW sheet
metal.  Don't think you're going to be welding long beads though.  At best do
maybe 1/2 inch sections, I do less.  Make sure you jump around from end to end
to keep heat down to a min.  I learned that on a nose section I still have to
fix. Use a air hose or a spray bottle (I know Eric will say this will weaken
the metal, but I'd rather weaken non structural metal than risk warping a piece
that will be a bitch to fit later) to cool your weld.  It will help you move
along faster.

Take the time to make the parts fit as close as possible.  This, unfortunately
is the hardest part about sheet metal welding.  You want a tight a fit BEFORE
you start zapping away.  A tight fit will help you from blowing through at the
edge.  BTW you will blow through the metal a lot when you first start...I
know.  Just be patient and do small little zaps to build up the hole and keep
it from getting bigger.  Don't get to antsy and go to fast....welding takes
patients.  If you keep building up from the weld bead onto the un-welded
portion you are more likely not to blow through.

Lastly, I highly recommend spending the money on a instant darkening helmet.
These can be expensive, but I personally wouldn't weld with out one.  It lets
you concentrate where your weld will start with out the guessing of the &quot;flip
and guess&quot; mode of the older style helmets.  This is very valuable when you're
just starting out.

Just my 25 cents worth.

Currently fixing passenger rocker and wheel well close out (thanks for the
parts Kelly)
