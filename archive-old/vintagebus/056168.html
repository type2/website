Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p


S'pose I should join in. I drive a barely running bus *every* day. My other
bus is a bicycle. Oh, and don't think it runs poorly for lack of attention;
no matter what's fixed, it just wants to give me grief (hence, it's name,
&quot;Grief,&quot; a kinduv ironic, misnomery bad-ass monikor addressing its flat
black over flat forest green color, while also being a namesake usually
associated with  military operations to intone that menacing bravado such
things demand).

And yet ... there is certain cause for celebration getting from Point A to
Point B. The bus I drove daily previous to this ran forever with minimal
problems for 20 years. Just basic upkeep. This splittie, Grief, though, far
prefers theater to the mundane.

But, nonetheless, thanks to Grief, giving me grief at the most inopportune
times in the past four years (unlike my previous splittie in its span of
20), I found this list.

Not a bad trade.

Craig.
