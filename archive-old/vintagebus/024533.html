Subject: Dual Carbs/Stock Exhaust

Anyone out there running kadrons, 1776 and a stock exhaust? I'm
considering pulling off my extractor so I can get a little more heat
with the stock muffler. I know it will be restrictive, but will it
overheat the engine? I have stock valves and a stock cam, so it
shouldn't be much of a problem. I could put my 30 pict -1 back on, but
it ices up when its chilly out and the duals do not ice up.
