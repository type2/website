Steve, 
  Its not a kombi, it is a sunroof standard , just like Dave Heards, but
newer. Probably the thing that makes this bus uncommon, not rare, is the combo
of bench seat and being a SS. Kent Schzocke from St. Louis used to own a bench
seat model , which is now owned by Emmett Goldsborough in Maryland. Most of
the SS's you see are walk throughs, like my brothers.
   
   All sunroof buses, double door buses, and Binz crewcabs came with belly
pans, for structural support.
                       Mike
