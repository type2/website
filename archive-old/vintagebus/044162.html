&gt;&gt;Getting close to paint on my westy and I'm thinking about picking
up a gallon today at the paint shop. Will one gallon do the job?&lt;&lt;



I just painted my 66 and it took 1/2 gallon of white to do the top of the sides and roof and not quite 1/2 gallon of gray to do the lower sections of the body.  The darker color didn't take as much so I would say that if you're painting a darker color, 1 gallon should just about do it!
