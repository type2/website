Subject: Re: [VB] signal canceller was Sticky/worn...

What's the proper position for the signal cancelling
plate on the bottom of the steering wheel?
It has 3 mounting holes, and the cancelling tab sticks
down for about 25% of the circumference. So that tab
can be at 3 positions under the wheel depending on how
you mount it.
I guess if VW was REALLY smart, they would have offset
one of the holes, making all three holes line up only
one way.

My signal cancels if I turn the wheel just a bit and
sometimes won't stay on.

Another question if I may.  Does anyone have
&gt; experience with a
&gt; possibly worn turn signal switch that will not click
&gt; or &quot;Stay&quot; to the
&gt; left or the right.  It will mostly just spring back
&gt; to the off
&gt; position.  Is it gunk and crud that is stuck in
&gt; there somewhere or are
&gt; there stops and things that can get too worn over
&gt; the years?  What can I
&gt; do?  WD-40?  Thanks, --JD
