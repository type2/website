Having worked Auctions for several years now, I thought I would chime in on
the subject.

What every one needs to rember is that E-Bay is an Auction.
The concept of an auction is to sell an Item to the person who is willing to
pay the most for it. At live auctions you usually only have a few seconds to
throw in you bid raising the price until only one person is willing to pay
more than anyone else. This usualy happens with 300 or less people able to
bid, As with E-Bay , the whole online world is able to bid. Because of that
a time limit is imposed. The current price is always posted because that is
the idea behind an auction, To get the most for an item as possible. It can
work the other way also, If the price is low you dont want to bid high.
An auction serves the seller by making the most $$ for him/her and serves
the buyer by giving him/her what they want at a price they like.
Just rember to set a price limit for yourself and you will not regret your
purchace.
