Volks,

I started to compose an involved progress report and then said, heck...
save the electrons :-)  I have put it at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus

Got to &quot;During&quot;.  Eventually there will be lots of days and I will need to
make an index page, but for right now there is just the one.

Executive Summary (that's &quot;teaser&quot; in bureacratese :-):

o The bus was delivered last Wed, 11/24, in good shape.
o I got it cleaned out and sealed up (new rear glass, tape front glass
  hole)
o The engine turns (even better when the trans is out of gear (ask me what
  an idiot I fealt like :-)).
o There is a lot of rust (what a surprise! :-)

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.

'73 Westy (awaiting VA inspection)
