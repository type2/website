Hello Everyone,

It is Thomas Burleson. On 8/21/99, my family (wife and 3 children)
were killed by a drunk driver. I was seriously injured. Neck was
broken in 4 places, broken collarbone, 2 broken ribs and a broken
nose. Plus I was bruised from the top of my head down to my right
knee.

My 1964 Bus was completely totaled. The man that hit us literally
drove through the passenger side of my bus.

I know that several list members have sent me cards, etc. I thought
everyone might want an update. The halo was removed on 11/23/99. I
have made a complete 100% recovery. There are no limitations on what I
can do. Basically if it hurts don't do it. I start physical therapy next
week.

The man that hit us is still in jail. The trail should start late
spring or early summer. His lawyer is very good at delaying the trail.
The state is ready to go.

I have settled the civil suit. I recently bought a 2000 Dodge ram.
Last Dec, I bought a 1968 vette. I know, I know. it is not a bus. I
would prefer another bus. However, I sat behind the wheel of a
friend's bus. I could not get out  from behind the wheel quick enough.
I believe my days of owning a bus r over.

If anyone wants to email me off list that is fine. my email address is
sixty4_Bulli_at_worldnet.att_dot_net.

There is a Bus Club in Az. that has contacted my neighbors several
times. I do not remember the Club name. feel free to contact me off
list.

Everyone thanks for your cards, prayers and kind thoughts. They helped
more than u will ever know.


Sincerely,


Thomas                          mailto:Sixty4_Bulli_at_worldnet.att_dot_net
