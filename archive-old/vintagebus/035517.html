BTW parts list says 

211 817 773 Gasket- air duct,  up to ch 215 190 000
211 817 773A    ditto from 216 000 001

 I thought that seal to stop the flap in the closed position was only found 
in later 64-67 or so busses?
 I put one in my 57 because it seemed to form a tighter seal.
 Plan to do the same with the 56 camper.
 I think they put a glue inside that vent at the seams of the sheet 
metal,like a black paste/rubber and it deteriorated.
 Lookslike rat droppings up there but they are really dried out rubber.
 Both my 56, 57 and 58 busses had little rubber bits to keep the thing from 
smashing when int he downward position.
