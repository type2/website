Your Bus sounds perfect right now but yes, what you want done can be done by
someone who knows how to color match and blend paint.

You'd be surprised how many &quot;Original Paint&quot; Buses have done this...

Hi guys,
I have a bus that has awesome original paint that buffed out really shiny.
Problem is I'd like to fix the 1% or so with some early signs of rust- under
the windshield etc. I would prefer to keep the original paint and have a few
spots ground, dings fixed, and some paint sprayed without doing an entire
paint job.  Is this adviseable or will it look ittyshay overall? The bus
looks really good as-is, but I'd like it to be near perfect and prevent
further rust down the road.  Thanks for the advise.
