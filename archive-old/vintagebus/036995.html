&gt; Thanks all for the advice, sorry I was not very specific but I do have two
&gt;  front springs that have been stored in grease paper and the rear torsion 
bar
&gt;  has been re-indexed to lower the truck. Nothing has been cut or welded
&gt;  (thankfully  !!) What is the appropriate angle and the best way to re-set 
the
&gt;  rear torsion bar/arm. The rear arm is under no tension whith the rear in 
the
&gt;  air and the transaxle removed.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks

you need an angle finder.   Red the section on the rear torsion bars in your 
Bentley.  If you dont have a (Bentley) 1963 Transporter Workshop manual go 
get one.   You have to find out how far off you present angle is, do the math 
to set it back right, turn inner bar this was each spline is x degrees, the 
spring plate is y degrees.  mark first setting before taking spring plate 
off,  (punch dots on spring plate and torsion bar).  The correct angle-- and 
pictures is in the book.   You can buy new rear tosion bushings (same as a 
bay window bus) at your VW dealer- install with talcum powder.
