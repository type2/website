&lt;&lt; if you use a bug tranny, you need to get the tranny out of the swing axle
bug,
 and pull the axles off it, the ring gear needs to be turned the other way, or
 you will have 4 reverse and one forward gear.   things need shimming in there
 with the cover plates. put your reduction boxes on it, and install.    &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
The problem with using a stock pre-1969 swing axle bug tranny is it has a .89
fourth gear.  The bus and K. Ghia used a .82 fourth.  Using the bug tranny .89
in a reduction gear bus will result in a loss of 5 MPH and you thought that
stock trannyed buses were slow to begin with.    Eric &amp; Barb

ya- a bug tranny does have a slower fourth gear.   However, it can be done,
and it sounded like the guy was sounding out possibilities, as he didn't have
much info/help where he was.  Thanks for pointing that out though.    
Although many people complain that buses are very slow due to the original
gearing, I have actually not been one of the complainers, as I don't mind
driving in the slow lane.

Clara
