Kirin Jacobsen of the VintagBus and I think the VintagVw list is wanting to
take a greyhound bus down here to SE Nebraska next summer and ride along
with me to one of the VW events.  He and his buddy Pete ae currently 14
years old and will need to clear such a trip with their parents.  I told
Kirin if he needs online references,  I can get them so basically all I'm
asking is that for those of you who have met me in person (and even those
who've simply known me on the list), to send an email to Kirin and tell him
what my online and in-person reputation is.  This will help him clear it
with his folks.  His email address is:  kirinjacobsen_at_hotmail_dot_com

Thanks!
