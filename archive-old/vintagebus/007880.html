Subject: bearing puller herring puller - transaxle leaks

After a very long break, during which I finished painting the house to stay
in the SO good books, I'm back to por-15'n the bottom of my bus.  In the
process I want to fix a couple of transaxle leaks and do my rear brakes and
check the bearings in my redux boxs, por-15 my brake drums and backing
plates  - someone told me that he thinks I have a bad bearing. I really had
a tough time getting a bearing out of a reduction box - I broke two bearing
pullers, one I bought - cheap piece o' crap and the other I rented - another
cheap piece o' crap.  Anyway, I did get it out but I broke it and it came
out in pieces - sh*t.  Anyway, what is the deal on these things, the idiot
book makes it seem fairly easy - I surely do -hope the other side is
easier - it took me a 1.5 days to get that first one out - ok, lots of
breaks but still ......

So, I'm hoping that I can replace the gaskets under the side covers of my
transmission - I'm starting to get the idea that it may not be as straight
forward as I originally thought.  Will I need any special tools for this?

Also there is an oil seal inside of the cover that houses the bearing in the
brake backing plate - I cannot get this out - it seems to be ..... glued
maybe?  So what's the deal on those things?  Shouldn't they just pop out?

I recently took my bus on a 3000 mi trip but before I left I took my bus to
a VW place.  They have a wrecking yard outside of town and a dealership in
the city.  Apparently, they have one of these ol' German mechanics that we
hear about  and he is supposed to be great - trained in Germany and working
on air-cooled cars since he was conceived - I was hoping to have him go
through my BN2 before I install it. Anyway, I was going on a long trip and I
wanted someone to fix my axle boot leak (I tried a few times and it still
leaked).  So, they took my bus and turned the axle boots such that the bolts
where on the top and they told my that my transmission was losing oil around
the side covers.  I noticed to today when I took my boots off that there was
actually a big hole in one - right at the bottom - they turned it so it
would leak!  (I doubt it was the ol' german guy that actually did the work)
These boots are less than a year old! What's the deal on those things! Also,
they don't seem to fit exactly right - my bus is a 60.

Anyway, I guess I'd better burn some incense and say a prayer to St. Muir
and maybe the bearings on the other side won't be as bad.

TIA
