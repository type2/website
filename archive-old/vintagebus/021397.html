Has anyone else started having problems finding 6V bulbs?  The local VW FLAPS 
doesn't carry them and the only place I could find them was the place in town 
that has lots of NOS and vintage stuff.  Then it cost us over $30 for all the 
needed bulbs, and we didn't even get headlight bulbs.  Over a buck a bulb on 
average.  Anyone else finding that more stuff than ever is becoming 
'obsolete'?

yes, I noticed that it was harder to find 6V bulbs in oly, Al's didn't have 
them, but Schmuck's did.      Schuck's is also Kragen and Checkers and a big 
chain and you could probably order bulbs through them.
