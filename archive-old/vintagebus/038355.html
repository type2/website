Make sure you use the right seals.There are a few different variations
depending on the case and cooler inlet/outlet size.the reason for this is
the later cases had larger(I think) ports and when fitting a later cooler
adaptor to an early engine you need a seal with two different OD's for it to
work right.Look in a new gasket kit there should be sets of different color
seals red,black,white and green if I rember right.Might be the problem.Hope
this helps.

Subject: [VB] Massive oil leak!!!


I replaced the seals in my doghouse style cooler a few weeks ago. I
immediately noticed the bus started running hot. I took it apart again to
see what the problem was, and discovered I had replaced the 2 seals that go
from the engine case to the cooler block with the wrong seals(too thick). I
have now replaced the seals with the correct ones and the motor leaks ALOT
of oil. Has anyone ever heard of the block between the motor and cooler
warping? The bus did get hot 5 or 6 times! Thanks,
