Stock is the best way to go in my thoughts. The type3 pulley is probably the
problem as I had a similar problem when a parts guy sold me the wrong pulley
by mistake. Tom's advice of pushing the Gen back might work but be careful
it does not rub the back of the fan shroud. It won't exactly hurt it for a
long distance but the noise is completely annoying. This happened to me as
well when I put a bent fanshroud on the motor that went into the 54 SC.

&gt; We are still in Cottonwood, just outside Jerome.  We are having a
&gt; problem with the belt twisting inside out when we reach high RPM (3500 -
&gt; 4000).
&gt;
&gt; Situation:
&gt;   generator pulley is from a 6 volt type 3
&gt;   Crankshaft pulley is new brazilian
&gt;   belt is 15350  (15/32 width - 35.0&quot; long)
&gt; pulleys are slightly offset ~ 1/4 &quot;

&gt; Our concern with going back to stock
&gt; is that we will be back to the 1.6 pulley ratio versus the 2.2 that we
&gt; have now and it will affect the cooling capability.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
