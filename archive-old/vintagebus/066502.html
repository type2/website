Subject: fuel smell

i have this brutal smell of fuel inside my bus, i had this last year right
before i put it in storage-i never found out why, it just went away...well
the smell is back again.

i checked all my fuel lines, and the ground around my bus and i don't see
any evidence of fuel leaking.

this smell is not just a pure fuel smell-it has a little hint of something
burning...

I was wondering if maybe some how some fule could have spilled onto the
heater tubes or something, but i imagine that it would not last there, ie it
would go away after driving it on the raod for a while.
