&gt; More than anything, I'm just trying to make sure my doors are lining up 
&gt; exactly like they need to, so I can check something out that is related to 
&gt; all this.  Can anyone else measure thier gap to see if 1/4&quot; is 'normal' or 
&gt; not?

Hi Eric,
First you should check your bus dimensions to the ones in the &quot;Workshop 
Manual Volkswagen Transporter&quot; section A-23, page 1.  After all your bus 
could have been &quot;repaired&quot; at one time!
Our two running buses have 1/8&quot; clearance at the rear of the door and about 
3/16&quot; at the front.  Though the 1960 walk thru camper converted panel van has 
its passenger door 1/16&quot; farther back than the others.
