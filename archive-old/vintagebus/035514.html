Hi John,
Best way we found to replace a broken bus wing window latch is to fix it!  
Almost all bus wing window latches when they break is in the base casting.  
We buy the new original pre-1967 bug wing window latches.  The base casting 
in 55-67 bus and 53-66 bug is the same!  Remove the pin that holds the bug 
handle/latch to the base casting.  Then lightly sand the bug chrome base by 
hand (Though having it powder coated would be better!) primer, and black 
paint the base to match the bus wing window latch.  Then install the bus 
latch handle pieces/parts (Replace any of the internal bus wing window parts 
with the bug pieces.) with graphite grease to increase latch lifespan!
