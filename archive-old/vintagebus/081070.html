Subject: 1st Annual Texas VW Classic

Drove to Fredericksburg, TX for the 1st Annual Texas VW Classic 
today. A coalition of TX VW clubs put it together. Have to say it 
looks like me going to Ennis is a thing of the past. They had great 
turnout for a first time event. 150 or so cars in the show I'd say. 
It was at Lady Bird Johnson Park in beautiful Fredericksburg. I 
missed out on the Saturday events, but heard it was tons of fun. 
Really only could swing the show. That was great. Weather was a 
little wet early off, but quit quickly and we had a nice overcast 
day...no hot sun. Really nice show weather.

Lots of nice VW's and cool people. Of note was Charlie from Austin's 
original condition 21-window safari window bus. It's got the 
maintenance records written on the inside of the engine lid in black 
marker! Another note, my buddy Raoul had an accident on the way there 
and totalled his killer yellow Super Beetle Baja. What a shame.

I posted a bunch of pictures. Great effort and great show put on by 
these Texas clubs. Pictures are at:
