Subject: Re: Bus Suspension Contraption
Mime-Version: 1.0

The original VW tool for the Beetle had support (a flat bar) for the front
of the chassis, and two vertical flat bars mounted vertically with rounded
cut-outs to matct the torsion bar tube at the rear.  Thus you could remove
front and rear suspension without the rolling fixture getting in the way.
It was open at the front, so you could raise the vehicle on a lift, then
lower it onto the fixture afterward.  I have used the Type I fixture, I
suspect one for the Type II could be made similarly...
