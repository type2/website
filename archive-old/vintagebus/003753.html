Hey NQ
             Take a look at the Kit this Australian company sales.  From the
main page click products.  Then select Spitwindow Type 2:Suspension.  With
the exchange rate there less then Wolfgang.  They are producing an updated
kit and I can't wait to get mine.  I've been emailing the guy for some time
now.  Decided to order one, so he's putting a kit aside when the new ones
are done, for me.  Should be pretty nice.  I've started collecting parts
now.

&gt; Does anyone here have a Wolfgang IRS kit for a split window bus they'd
like
&gt; to sell?  I've got a few parts that are worthy of trade but I'm looking to
&gt; buy without the price tag and this is why used is okay.  I like the
&gt; reduction boxes but I like the low maintenance and less potential for
leaks
&gt; that you find on a IRS equipped machines.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to hear both sides of the story about converting to IRS and
not
&gt; WHEN USING a T4 2L engine.  I know Scott Fraser will have some comments to
&gt; make...anyone else?
&gt;
