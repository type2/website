And, if you're getting goggles, buy the splash-proof variety.  Those
little bits of stuff fly through the vent holes in ordinary goggles.

As a teacher, I am very conscious of eye safety, to the tune of a class
set of goggles ($500) and an ultraviolet cabinet to sterilize them ($700).
Still, this is better than a lawsuit for loss of an eye (average award
$5,000,000)

If you find conventional goggles to be uncomfortable, adjust the strap.
Usually they are adjusted too tight.
