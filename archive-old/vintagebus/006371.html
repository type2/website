ya I have seen that one too. It has been sitting down town for the past 2-3
years at a buisness, untill recently I guess. when I talked to the owner he
said that it was 71 that had a nose job back in the early eighties. It also
has had the back portion of the of the cab replaced (bed line to below
window) with flat sheet metal.
I was going to buy it back then but decided aginst it due to its various
hacks.
BTW the owner back then also had a early single cab split with the extra
wide bed. I think he is still down there I will need to go down and look
some time soon. It was kinda over by the Swiss tavern but up a few blocks if
I remeber right.
