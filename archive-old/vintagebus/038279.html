I have used the stuff a number of times and have always been very happy with
the results.

I use two coolers. A small Coleman to hold the dry ice and any stuff that I
want frozen and a large one to keep the stuff that I want cooled cool. 

I insulate the dry ice with a couple layers of cardboard and then bag it in
the small cooler. I get pieces that are about 8 inches cubed so I can fit
three insulated blocks in at a time. I the wraop the small box in a an old
sleeping bag.

One of the blocks keeps the large box extremely cold. One has to introduce a
lot of warm beer to use up a block in a day. When one 'melts' you open the
small box just long enough to grab a new box and chuck it in the big box.

I have had an arrangement like this keep me in very cold beer and ice for
whiskey for four days in the height of summer.

It works well if you are on a budget but if you have the money and the space
a good quality three way freezer is the business.

Later 

Michael
