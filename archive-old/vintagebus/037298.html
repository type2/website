&lt;&lt; Thank goodness. I've had that one too. I pulled into the gas station in my
 '68 Crewcab and was asked
 
 &quot;Just what is that?&quot; &gt;&gt;

Can't tell you how many times I've been asked &quot;Did you do that yourself?&quot; when
driving my '63 Crew.  Then you tell them it's factory and they don't believe
you.....
