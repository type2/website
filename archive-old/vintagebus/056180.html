Subject: Hello, newcomer here with some quick questions

Hello, My name is Jason and I just joined this list. I have a 64 split
window bus with a 71 bettle engine in it. I'm having some difficulty with
the charging system and was hoping someone here could help out a bit.

First of all, I have been told that there is no way to test the generator or
regulator to see if they are functioning, I find that hard to believe,
anyone know how I can check them?

When the engine is running, I get zero voltage coming from D+ and likewise,
zero on DF. I saw something that said to tie DF to +12v and measure D+, but
I did that and still get nothing. I just replaced the generator, so I'm
fairly confident it's good, but the regulator is about 6 months old and
could have sustained some sort of damage in that time (the engine threw a
rod and was replaced so who knows what else could have happened.)

Can anyone point me in the right direction here? I'd love to get this thing
running so I can move on to body work :-)

Jason Shelton
