En réponse à Andre Hryn &lt;hryn_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;:

&gt; I've got a few friends in Europe that are &quot;Vintage VW&quot; fans like you. I
&gt; may
&gt; get you in touch with them... I just need to talk to them. To start
&gt; looking
&gt; for your Bus go over to Everett's website and search ads. You might find
&gt; a
&gt; few Buses for sale in your neck of the woods... Check:
&gt; www.thesamba_dot_com/vw

thank's a lots ... I ve look in the VB archive and I found some links on this 
site ... I will look on it a bit more un details ... 

&gt; Good luck and welcome to the list,

thank's for your help and your kindness ... 

Olivier
