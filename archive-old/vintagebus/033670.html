Subject: RE: [VB] Overreving

   What happens is the larger intake valve has air besides the cam moving
the valve. The valve float is created by the suction of the piston pulling
the valve down to far, actually hitting the top of the guide and hammering
it out (at higher rpm's). The duel springs will keep this from happening.
This is what I was informed of by the machine shop. The owner of the machine
shop learned about VW engines by building racing engines for AUTOCRAFT for
15 years, so I listen to what he says, weather right or wrong. I don't like
rev limiters as they cut the spark off and cause misfiring. I will be more
careful and look at my tach when revving high and try to keep it under 6500.

How will the new guides be better equipped to handle the higher revs?
I can understand changing the springs -  I recently learned a *VERY*
painful lesson in valve float - an will henceforce keep my engine
rev limited to ~6500.

Are there any lighter valves available?

Sounds like you need a rev limiting rotor, too.

&gt;    Well I found out the problem with my new 1800. I lost the intake valve
&gt; guides due to overeving. I build my engines to rev high, but didn't do
this
&gt; one to the limits of what it will turn. My tach was broken (damn VDO
crap).
&gt; My heads are at the machine shop now getting new guides installed and duel
&gt; springs, instead of the single (which are good to 6000 rpm's.  This engine
&gt; will rev to close to 7000 rpm's and I have no problem running it at 4500
for
&gt; short periods and up to 6000 for hill climbs. I am going to install the
new
&gt; tach I have to monitor this situation a little better.  I am extremely
&gt; pleased with the performance and the power and once I get a few bugs
sorted
&gt; out I should be real happy along with the DD.
