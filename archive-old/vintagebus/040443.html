I'll toss in my dos equis here. In earlier splitties, the ice box is in fact less useful because it's just a cooler with drawers. You can improve the insulation with spray foam and new seals on the door (be creative). I used to buy block ice and it would last 2-3 days in all but the worse heat. I fabricated a shelf for this above the drain plate (using an old aluminum cookie sheet). This plate maximized space in the cooler and I always felt the aluminum radiated cool...but I was a stoner back then, so maybe *I* was radiating cool. ;)

Another option, if you're looking for function, is to get a later icebox with the water tank in it...if you can find a water tank worth having. In my '70 westy, I logged thousands upon thousands of miles and I can say with confidence that I never went thursty...even when cotton-mouth set in. I also have relatives in NC with excellent wells. I would fill up my tank at their house and it would last a long time...genuine spring water in my home on wheels.

For my next bus, I've taken it a step further. I recently purchased a dometic fridge from a Type2 listee in CA and had him ship it to me. This gives me an actual 12-volt fridge and a propane cook stove. I'll be sure to figure *something* out for the water.

Alas, I have sold my good '64 Standard and I'm considering a '74 camper...so I may be splitless for a while...at least until I can get the '64 21-window on the road. I realized that I need a camper bus for my needs...but I managed to save another split along the way (that's 2 splits and a bay saved from Purgatory; I figure one more will get me an audience with St. Pon.)

Oh well, the buyer won't take delivery probably til sometime next month, so at least I have one to drive until then.

Take care! Joe
