Happy friday all you volkies

Hooked up my heeter tubes and insulated everything, got a nice warm blast of
air on my windshield.

Two problems:  exhaust smell.  Seems like I ran from my muffler pipe, a hose
to the cab.  Likely a leak in the heat exchanger, right?  My plan was to block
one, then the other to see if I can isolate the leaky one...Any other bright
ideas there?  How do these exchangers work anyway? does the hot exhaust gas
plumb thru the middle and the fresh air is in the outer shroud?  Is the
exhaust smell coming from the somewhat loose outer shroud being contaminated
from engine compartment air or likely from a leak in the inner exhaust
pass-thru?  Am I making sense here?  may day may day.......

The other problem is the wipers.  What a joke.  They indeed turn on when
asked, but kind of float accross the top of the windshild crud, kind of waving
hello to the  window or trying to dry it with a fanning motion.  On my 71 loaf
there was a spring that held tension against the glass.  How can you get the
blade tighly pressed against the surface of the glass.
2nd problem, part two....squirters, or more correctly lack of them.  Does
Germany not have the car infront of you spit muddy icey schmegma on your wind
shield?  What year did squirters become available?  I can live with no
freaking gas guage and my whole engine diagnosis hanging on two measly lights,
but c'mon no windshield squirter?  Has anyone rigged one?  I am thinking about
some sort of bladder up in the eyebrow vents actuated by some sort of button
that would dangle out of the interior head vent.  (I hate to drill holes).
This would have gravity on our side, dribbling down on the glass instead of
requiring squirting up.
Either that or keep reaching out the window with a rag at stop lights.....
Whats up with this &quot;Rain-x&quot; I read about on Hoover Sermon pages?

Thanks for any insight..
