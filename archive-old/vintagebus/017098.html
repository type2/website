It doesn't take months.  One thing that will do it is putting your e brake 
on while the bus is still moving.

&gt; &gt; Sounds like it was driven a lot with the e-brake on. Ouch.
&gt;
&gt;I would have thought so too. But this happened on my own bus. I have done
&gt;some loopy stuff in it but to the best of my knowledge driving around for
&gt;months on end with the e brake on is not one of them ;-) Would it require
&gt;months of driving to do this or would a day or two be enough?
&gt;
&gt;The e brake cables also seem to move feely enough with the drums and shoes
&gt;off. Is there any reason other than the e brake having been on that could
&gt;explain this?
&gt;
&gt;If there isn't then the only thing that I can think of is that the mech 
&gt;that
&gt;I sent the bus to for the front end overhaul drove it around with the e
&gt;brake on. He is the only person who has driven this bus for more than a 
&gt;mile
&gt;other than me for a couple years.
&gt;
&gt;Later
