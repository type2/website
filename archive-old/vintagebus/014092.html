also please be carefull while opening the engine comp. if you have a  fire, 
if there is any kind of lack of oxygen, when that door opens you would need 
a bottle of b.b.q. sauce for your face because it would be charred. i saw in 
high school that the advice was to (on those sorry front engine type of 
cars) spray the extinguisher into the grill first. i am not sure if this 
would work on our superior machines' vents, but if you have a spare second 
during the fire i hope it might save some eyebrows.
