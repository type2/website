 The recently purchased '67 came complete with some pretty sloppy steering.
 Local NEATO boss Neil Picket was kind enough to drive the bus and crawl
 under to check it out for me. His diagnosis was a well worn drag link and a
 beam in need of lotsa grease. Steering box seems fine. Also the steering
 wheel is about 30 degrees off but it is my understanding that a proper front
 end setup should correct that. I wanna go ahead and straighten out the front
 end mess and put some new tires on the bus before I start driving it. I will
 at this point refraim from starting the tire war on the list. If you have
 tire recomendation please p-mail them to me:)
 
 As long as the draglink is being replaced should I go ahead and replace tie
 rods,damper, and or anything else? It looks like BusDepot_dot_com has most of
 what I need parts wise. Any recomendations on what kinda puller I should
 get? I am gonna replace the schocks. I have driven KYBs on a bay for a while
 and felt ok about them but I have been cautioned that KYBs feel quite stiff
 on a split. How about Boges of good ol' cheap Monroes up there?
 
 I recently spoke to a gentleman that drove a 1965 bus for about twelve
 years. When he purchased it in the mid 80s it had EMPI antisway bars
 installed on the front and rear. He stated that the bus handled like no
 other had ever owned. Anyone install an aftermarket antisway setup?Is it
 worth it and is now the time to do it while other front end work is being
 handled?
 
 I really wanna do this right and do it once so I can move on to other
 mechanical areas of repair so any advice is welcome.

I belive Neil knows what he is talking about, so get you a new drag link and 
get it put on the car. Or do it yourself .  I us ethe BFH method.  ( If you 
want to double check his diagnosis, or just see the deal, lie under your bus 
looking up at the steering stuff and have someone gently wiggle the wheel in 
the loose area.   Read the idiot book chapter on steering. )  Ask them to 
center the steering wheel, it is an adjustment on the drag link.   Buy you a 
grease gun and several tubes of grease and a floor jack.  Jack up the bus on 
the front beam, and grease the suspension till fresh grease comes out.   Get 
ALL the zerk fittings- there are four on each spindle, as well as the 4  on 
the beam and the one on the swing lever, and older busses havethem on the 
drag link and tie rod ends, brake cables, and more!!!!  I grease at every 
3,000 mile service, cause grease is good and easy and more fun than replacing 
steering knuckles.

you should have an anti sway bar on a 67, they were introduced in 66.



don't  fix what ain't broke.  I am sure you will find more to repair that is, 
so dont burn yourself out on the steering.  

I have been driving my 65 westy for about 3 1/2 years, and it's not all fixed 
yet.   ANd I should get new tires.  I have a list of things to get done, some 
aren't done cause of money, some aren''t done cause of time, but I did what 
NEEDS to be done to have a driving bus.  cept I think it's time to examine 
the brakes again.  That I can't put off like I can replacing a slightly worn 
steering box. (about two inches of play in the steering- at my outer 
allowable limit.)   Besides, I'd like to get a nice White steering wheel if I 
could.  dont many of us?
