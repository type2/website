Thanks to a fellow liste and some reasurch at Pomona today, i finally
know what interior trim i need.  I am looking for one 21-1/2&quot; and two
14&quot; interior front door trim pieces.  Can anyone help me locate these in
good shape.  Also looking for 2 aluminum coat hangers, a dash pod trim
ring and a clock with a clean bezzle.  Can anyone help?...
FS.  $6,500 and needed a total go thru.  I was hoping to find that
elusive middle 2/3 seat or a engine lid, but no.  We left SOTO preaty
.....-- - - - -  -

I have some aluminium coat hooks- the ones used on the 63 and earlier deluxes.
Are those what you are looking for?    What are you looking for the engine lid
for?   one with the elbow prop (59-dec 63) or with the spring( dec 63- end 65
model)
