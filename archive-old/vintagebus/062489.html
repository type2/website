Subject: Flipper door handle on a 65 bus?

Hi,

I always liked the more elegant flipper front door handle. Is it 
possible to put that on a 65 bus? If not, anyone need one?

I never really liked the later-style bus handle because inevitably the 
key slot gets warped from key insertions and it gets a bit sharp on the 
thumb when you press in the button. I have several (about 5 of these) 
and they are all about the same.

When I used to drive my bus, I got in the bad habit of not closing my 
door just so I didn't have to engage the lock button. Maybe I should 
just give into the SoCal thing and put solenoids in my doors and shave 
the handles.

Conrad
