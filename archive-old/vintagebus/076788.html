Subject: Re: [VB] Re: front shift coupler &amp; screw?

Ya I was ordering some stuff from WW the other day, and asked about the front 
coupler, when he said it was $20, I said ''You're sh*$$ing me!&quot;   for a 
freeking inch or so piece of pipe with a threaded hole tapped in.   FWIW, if your 
threads are bunged up you can drill another hole and tap it to the right size 
(same as the ubiquitous 13mm biolts holding your bus together... thinks its M8 
x 1.25, but check the bolts 1st I may have the numbers wrong.   I am generally 
really impressed w/WW and Rich who answers the phones there is a really nice 
guy, but when I got  the front coupler for my 61 I felt the ID was a bit 
large.   Still, it works.  That said, if I need a front shift coupler again I'll 
find a piece of pipe and drill a hole (or two as the case may be) and tap them.  


I always find alternating heat and squirting it w/ water to cool it down 
(sizzle stearm) really helps.   90% of the time I can get it apart w/o destroying 
the old front coupler. 

Often a local VW place will have the screws.  Heck, maybe the dealer does.

&gt; Billy -

&gt;     Since you have a 65 you will have the late coupler. I just went through 
&gt; this on my bus.  I ended up getting a coupler and screw from wolfsburg west a 
&gt; bit expensive $20 for coupler $2.50 for screw.  Their website shows none in 
&gt; stock but when I called they had one.  I cut mine off with a dremel tool, it 
&gt; was a pain but I didn't damage my shift rod. 
&gt;     I assume you will change the plastic bushing at the front of the rod?
&gt;     
&gt;     good luck
