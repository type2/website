I have found that with any kind of towing, one must make certain allowances
for the performance and maneuverability of both vehicles.  This method is
not any different.  The towing vehicle has always been a truck in my
cases....only once was it a full-sized pickup, and that caused some minor
problems due to the differences in bumper height.  I seem to remember taking
the corners wide, but it wasn't too bad....

&gt; What kind of turning does this allow?  Seems like the bumpers would hit.
&gt; Even using a tow bar on my type 1 limited how sharply you could turn.
