I forgot to mention one very important thing re: the external oil cooler
idea:

I will not stick one of those things on the side of my bus!!  My thought was
to mount it in that one of those recesses underneath the cargo floor...ahead
of the engine enough so that the heat doesn't feedback....and on standoffs
of some kind for good venting, and of course, the body would be
insulated.......

    Or should I use that heat in the winter?!
