Hi!

I am going to remove that silly 110vAC connector from the rear of my
bus....I'll not be using it, y'see, and I would like to install a powerful,
wide-beam reverse light that can be activated by a switch that I install
somewhere up front (can be later changed to a tranny switch when I get a new
tranny)

I will not be cutting the body of my bus, however.

So.

Does anyone know of an elegant, functional reverse-light fixture that would
fit in the hole left by the AC hookup?  Halogen would be best, btw....

Thanks,

Gene
