Rob I feel for you and applaud your decision to grab the wrench. Being a
dub owner puts you into a special category, back yard mechanic. You are
right in the fact that there are not many places you can take your dub
nowadays and suddenly you can become friendless when asking for help.
But rest assured that even tough you might be the only one under your
bus with grease on your shirt, the list IS out here to help in anyway we
can!

Keep the faith!

 But everyone on the list replied &quot;I do it in 1/2 hr!&quot; &amp; &quot;i do it with
two #5 screwdrivers&quot; &amp; &quot;i do with a piece of allthread i found walking
home the other day&quot; and someone I know said it was &quot;a perfect piece of
cake&quot;.  All LIES!!

So, I did it myself. It wasn't fun, but the feeling of being done was,
and if I had to do it again, it wouldn't be too bad.   Part of the
reason I am back into wrenching is to build up my sense of
accomplishment.

I guess the point of the story is that yeah, its gonna be hard to find
people to fix your old vw, but the more you do yourself, the more
understanding and empathy you have and also a sense of who can will do
the work properly ( and more often than not its YOU! ). It sounds like
you got a sting of bad mechanics I agree, but don't count your own
ability out, I didn't

Not even my friends will help me when I beg/bribe them, my girlfriend
helped me put in new windshield glass when I first got the bus and now
see just rolls her eyes when I mention it.

use the list - it works!
