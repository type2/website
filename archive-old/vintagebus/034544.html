1500 H series engine in a bus.  Appears stock.

Carb was dumping gas into engine for an undetermined amount of time (I
just bought it) - black plugs and lots of gas in the oil, which has been
since replaced.

Oil light takes a few seconds to go out after starting and comes on at
normal idle.  Sometimes comes on almost as soon as I take my foot off
the gas.  Revving to est. 1500 RPM makes it go out.

My guess is the bad flooding &quot;cleaned&quot; the engine to the extent that
bearings are now loose enough to reduce oil pressure.

I'm wondering if a &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump might keep me from having to
tear down the engine.  It's not my dailiy driver -- I'd like to keep it
runnable for once or twice a week pleasure trips around town.

Any suggestions on further diagnostics or baling-wire solutions
appreciated!

can you beg borrow or steal an oil pressure guage to compare actual psi with? 
 using thicker oil makes more pressure.  HD oil relief spring?  Round town 
local trips dont sound like heavy duty hauling long distances- ya the motor 
might last quite a while.  at a couple local drives a week.  dunno.
