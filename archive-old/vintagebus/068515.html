Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums, stuck steering wheels etc.

The puller there I have built and used with no damage to a steering wheel.
If made without the angle, rubber pads and also locking down the bolts to
the puller you would damage the wheel spokes. One other puller I have seen
for bus wheels had 2 forged rubber covered hooks mounted to a puller frame
that you hooked the spokes and applied pressure to the shaft. pulled wheel
off by the spokes w/ no damage. Not saying that any design is perfect but
any puller used on a 35 to 50+ year old wheel can crack the plastic, no
matter where it pulls from you are still stressing the metal and plastic
that have nothing but the molding process that holds one to the other.
