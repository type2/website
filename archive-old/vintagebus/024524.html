Subject: Snapped Valve

Ok all you engine gurus, I've got some questions for you.  I just picked
up a 69 bus that was &quot;broken down and just won't run anymore&quot;. (great
story, but I'll save that for a Friday)  After pulling the engine I
checked the spark plugs and noticed #1 plug had been banged up like some
one had dropped it before installing it.  All the others looked ok.  I
tried turning the crank and could only go about 350 degrees in either
direction.  Something was stopping it.

I stripped the engine down and popped off the 1 &amp; 2 head (figuring
something was wrong with #1 cyl) and found a snapped intake valve.  The
part of the valve that was rattling around inside the piston is about
20mm long,  the remainder of the stem was just sitting there in the
valve guide.  I popped off the other side and all looked comparatively
ok, but  #3 exhaust valve adjuster screw and nut were sitting in the
valve cover.

Questions,
Has anyone seen a valve snap like this before? What could cause this to
happen?  I checked the setting of the adjuster screw and it was only a
few threads beyond the end of the rocker arm.
