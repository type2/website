Yeah, it's a limited market but... I find myself with 2 extra Barndoor shop
manuals, here's the data:

1. Water damaged '53-'54 Barndoor shop manual, all pages there and readable,
rare, hard back cover MIA - $100
2. Nice '53-'54 Barndoor shop manual, minor waviness of pages, no damage,
all pages turn freely and smoothly and are clean and clear, one of the nicest
I've seen - $225

#1 - I'll trade for $100 of early Bus parts (no garbage) or a 1954 Bus English
owner's manual
#2 - Cash only

Yes, it's weird that I have 2 extras, these are hard to find.

If anyone is interested, let me know.
