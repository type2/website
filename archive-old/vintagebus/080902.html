Subject: PaintFest

I can setup a small webpage on MSNGroups. I don't know if this will allow 
everyone to view it or participate on it without a .NET pasport. I already 
have one setup for free but it only allows for 3MB of storage. I would be 
willing to pay for the extra space needed so that we can all upload pics of 
the Buses that want to participate. But if this is a NO NO to some because 
of the MSN factor then I will try to setup something somewhere else.

Let me know what you guys think or if somebody has other ideas sites to use, 
etc.
