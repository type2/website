Subject: RE: [VB] paint stripping?

  An old trick I learned years ago was to use OFF oven cleaner. I use to
remove the graffics from my old work trucks with it when we changed the logo

ronnie

my new to me 63 flip seat was repainted metalic green with the OG tukis
paint still underneath. I am going to try the oven clener tomorrow to see if
I can remove the respray, otherwise it's a lot of scrpping and sanding

Subject: [VB] paint stripping?


can anyone recommend a good product/procedure to
remove a layer of cheap rattlecan paint without
harming the original paint underneath? The spraypaint
on top looks pretty old, and in some spots i can
scrape it off with a fingernail!
