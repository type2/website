&lt;&lt; Does anyone see any flaws in this?  Please let me know if this sounds dumb
 or not - I think it just might work.  I know it isn't show-quality but for
 those of us keeping our VWs going on a shoestring budget,  we gotta work
 with what we have. &gt;&gt;
Hi No Quarter,
Well we thought of that also.  The main thing that is not going keep the rust
away is the plastic against the sheet metal.  This will keep the moisture
longer and wick it behind the plastic due to capillary action.  Instead we are
looking at a VW shop bullitians manual we have.  VW had bleprints showing how
to cut and shave styrofoam panels to fit the areas in the cargo walls and even
ceiling.  Plus paneling blueprints to cover the insulation.  This and using
tar to coat the sheet metal first should do the trick without rusting.  We are
starting to remove and replace the rusty metal in our panel and do a body work
and paint next.  Then are planning to try out styrofoam panels from our local
hardware store.  Eric &amp; Barb
