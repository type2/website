For those of you in the area who are interested, the Arizona Bus Club will be
'carabusing' to Tucson for Southwest Bug In.  The caravan will leave the
&quot;Fry's Electronics&quot; parking lot on Baseline Rd. and I-10 at noon on Saturday,
Oct. 24.  We'll take our time getting there since the SW 'Slamboree&quot; won't get
out until around 4:00 or 5:00.  Horizontally Opposed members may be joining us
as well.  e-mail or call if needed: JDStanton5_at_aol_dot_com........(602)877-8662.
