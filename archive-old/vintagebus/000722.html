&lt;&lt; I think this is Mark Stephens PROformance in Tehachapi, they heat-treat 
Type IV
 heads the way AVP in Sacramento does... supposed to make 'em last a good long
 time... they sure are expensive, though. &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Great, thanks for the info!  Expensive compared to?  How much are type 4 
heads going for now?  Rebuilt/new?  Or if you are comparing type 4 to the 
type 1,2 &amp;3 engines one has to remember that type 4 engines last over 200,000 
miles (Have seen a few over 300,000 miles.) easily in much heavier late model 
buses.  While the earlier 1,2 &amp; 3 engines seem to be lucky if they get over 
100,000 reliable miles a rebuild in the lighter earlier bus.
It would be very interesting to know if the valve seats tendancy to drop out 
is due to overheating, warping of the heads or having the aluminum head 
material expand faster than the steel seat.  This could be due to too high of 
RPMs/hot weather.  Knowing how often this happens in N. Euro compared to S. 
Cal would possibly be helpfull.  Eric&amp;Barb
