&gt; Just picked up a sunroof for the '65 deluxe. It'll need some working
&gt; over, but while I wait for parts and a Bently manual, I have one
&gt; question.  Why does it say &quot;Golde&quot; on the handle?  It's a chrome handle
&gt; with two major pieces, the handle pivots away from the center. Is this
&gt; stock? Who or what is Golde? Auf Deutsch for Sky?

Golde is the company that made the sunroofs.
