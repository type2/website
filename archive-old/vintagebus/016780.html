I have documents stating the Camp Box was available up
until end of SO-23 production...some where mid `61...I
have a dated late `60 Camp Box-mosaic price run down
sheet in Gernman on Westfalia letter head...

&gt; I always thought the &quot;campbox&quot; kit was pre '59. 
&gt; But, a friend of a friend just bought the Mango bus
&gt; that's been up for sale in the So. Cal. area for the
&gt; last few months, with the &quot;dealer provided&quot; original
&gt; campbox kit similar to Thom's.  This bus originated
&gt; in Carpinteria , CA. just a few miles down the road
&gt; from Santa Barbara.  It's supposedly documented that
&gt; this bus came from the delaer with and early campbox
&gt; kit.  And we all thought '61 only had the SO-23 kit.
