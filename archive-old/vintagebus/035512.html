Subject: Re:  [VB] preheat tube
To: pjblanch_at_usa_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com

there is one style of preheat pick up tube for the left, 
another for the right.  
THey are not mirror images though, the left is straight, the right kinda like 
a J. 
    bugs and buses used one of these through 67,  the 1500 67 bug used 
Both!!!!.   Some of the buses used neither, but instead a pick up from the 
heater box, though, and not from by the head.  with the heater box pickup, 
the tube goes forward past the #1 cyli, through the front tin, and attaches 
to the heater box, which has an outlet.  then you have pressurised  warm air 
to the air cleaner- hm- how does that change things?

the air cleaner was moved to the right about late 63.

However, now I'm a bit confused. I'll send you a picture of a '67 bus
compartment straight from a sales brochure. (I ripped it off of a listmember's
website. I can't for the life of me remember who it was.  Could this person
provide a link for people here?) This picture shows the paper preheat hose
entering the tin on the left side of the engine to get air from the #4
cylinder, not the right side to get air from the #2 cylinder.  Is the '67 a
one year arrangement in that earlier vehicles had the hose on the right hand
side?

Is the &quot;J&quot; part there to make the tube stick straight up instead of at an
angle like what happens with the straight tube?
