   Keep your eye's peeled when they show this on TV. Being Havasu is a
overnight stop, the race here will be getting a lot of coverage (TV). The
London Bridge Bullis (Buses by the Bridge 2002) and hopefully all the other
VW Bus owners plan to all park along main street when all the &quot;race cars&quot;
come to town . The start finish line is on main street so hopefully they
will be interested in seeing a row of early VW buses lining the street and
will film us.  Those of you who know me can be assured that I will be
harassing the TV crews to do just that. If they can show Terry Bradshaw
driving a Deluxe bus through a brick wall on TV they can  show a row of
buses parked along the street.

From listening to Bill Collins' presentation on the subject at the
Kelley Park dinner, the average joe doesn't have a snowball's chance
in hell of seeing that $250k.

BTW, the Great Race is a time-and-distance rally, and not a true race.  

The professional teams, who are the ones who actually have a shot
at the money, have entire semis full of support equipment and spare
parts, and teams of mechanics who go over the car each and every night.
I'm willing to be that with this kind of effort, even if you *did* win,
you *might* break even.

about 
&gt; the rules the auto to be entered has to be a pre-1960 race car or
motorcycle, 
&gt; all other cars must be pre-1951.  So it looks to us that one would have to

&gt; enter a 1950 BD or if you could get VW to release the 49 prototype to
you.....
