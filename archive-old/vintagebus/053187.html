Subject: RE: [VB]  my new bus/here we go

Rumor has it that there is going to be a VW Freak (vehicles, not the people)
show at the Classic this year. I heard about that and had to go by this bus
just for that. It does run and drive. It has been a work in progress for
over 20 years!! and will probably take me that long to finish.

ps go to Everett's site and see more pics in the gallery
