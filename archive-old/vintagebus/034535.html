&lt;&lt; I've been kicking the idea for sound deadening and insulating my 66, I know
the
 bagged insulation idea will cause trouble, the plastic will hold condensation
 and sweat moisture. But there are foam sheet's that might work. I know from
my
 windsurfing and surfing there are a couple of types of foam closed cell and
 urethane (coolers and 
 surfboards) surfboard foam soaks up water like a sponge but is easy to sand.
 Closed cell foam won't water log but is a bitch to shape. I think that in
thin
 enough sheet it might work.

Find a roofer and ask him for a roll of rubberized membrane material. It's
been used for the last few years as an intermediate layer on roofs, especially
flat roofs. Its used extensively here in Florida and is usually guaranteed for
at least 10 years. Its totally waterproof and is self sealing from punctures.
It comes 1/2-3/4&quot; thick and is easy to cut to form. Many auto restoration guys
are now using this for insulation and sound deadening.
