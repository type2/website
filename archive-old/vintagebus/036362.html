&gt; Hello bus gurus.  I have a question or two.  The first is just a
curiosity.  
&gt; Part number 211 721 631A  and  211 721 631B.  It seems the B is for
early bus 
&gt; and A is for late.  Am I confused or is this one of those oddball VW 
&gt; contradictions?
&gt; 
&gt; - - --  -
&gt; the one with the prefix A is earlier than the one with the prefix B
(and 
&gt; there may be C, D, E, F etc versions)
&gt; 
&gt; 211 721 631  is lever- accelerator cable (LHD) from ch 20-117 902  
(58 , 63 
&gt; ed)
&gt; 211 721 631 B is lever- accelerator cable (LHD) from ch 20- 117 902
(mid 67 
&gt; ed)
&gt; 
&gt; I figure version A is the same thing.  evidently they tried to
improve the 
&gt; part, but as you know, they still get bent.  oh well.  nice to have a
new one.
&gt; ..........
&gt; The second question is on part number 211 425 119.  What are these? 
I 
&gt; couldn't find them in my books.  They are a grommet or bushing of
some sort.
&gt; 
&gt; - - - - - 
&gt;  well, the 4 section is front axe/steering, but I dont see a 425
group.  hm  
&gt; ????\
&gt; ......
&gt; __________-------- steering dampner bushing--------------

&gt;                    just something to do
&gt;
