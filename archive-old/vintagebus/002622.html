Nope, not really. I suppose if you wanted you could remove the spring plate
bolts, large tranny mount nuts, clutch cable, accelerator cable, shift
coupler and possibly brake lines, and leave the fuel line and wiring to the
engine hooked up, provided there is enough slack. Then you could move the
tranny back just far enough on a floor jack to make it next to impossible to
remove the nosecone and reinstall it. Don't know why you'd want to. Unplug a
couple of wires and the fuel line and drop the dude. It really isn't that
bad. You're going to be 95% there anyway. It has to be done, might as well
get on with it. Replace your brake flex lines and rear shift rod bushing
while you're in there.

Merry merry and happy happy
