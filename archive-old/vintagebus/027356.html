Subject: Floor maddness

Was writ:
&lt;&lt;  One thing I was wondering, the carpet + padding was lain down on
some 
plywood, which was *damp* and rotten when I pulled it out (it folded!),
yet 
no rust on the floor.  What gives?  Is it because the primer was still
there? 
&gt;&gt;
Hi Andrew,
Yes, you were lucky not to find more rust there!
Eric&amp;Barb

I'll second that. When I lifted the plywood on the 65 Westy all I saw
was straight through to the dirt and grass. Not much left to rust.
Thanks to Ronnie for parts and local help for welding support The
Batmobile is in the home stretch. It will still be a long stretch bot I
can see it now. Momma take me home. I wanna paint the Westy.
