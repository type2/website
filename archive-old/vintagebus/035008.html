&lt;&lt; I checked my parts manual (thanks steven howell), and there is only one 
part
 # listed for the light switch.  Does that mean that the euro busses came
 equipped with a five (5) terminal switch, but only used 4 of them? Hmmm.&gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Our 1960 panel camper conversion has a four terminal Euro switch with no # 57 
terminal in it even though it needs a five terminal US version.
 
&lt;&lt;Let's say I keep the current headlights.  When I find a switch, do I need 
one with screw terminals, or with pull tab terminals, or is there a 
difference? &gt;&gt;
1960 was the last year VW used the screw terminals.   Eric&amp;Barb
