Subject: Towing with a Freeway Flyer

Trying to decide between stock and FF.  Conventional wisdom seems to be that my 1600SP will be enough to power it over Florida's mountainous 
terrain.

Next question.  I have a small boat that I regularly tow behind my 71 westy with this engine in it.  Almost unnoticeable (I said it was a small boat).  I'll 
be selling the 71 and putting the engine in the 65 standard, which is the one with the to-be-replaced tranny.

Anyone towing stuff with their FFs and non-monster motors?  Boats, utilities, Pucks, whatevah?  I'd be towing to campsites and boat ramps within 
about 100 miles of here, max.

Man, I'm getting the vibe that I need to use a stock ratio and get happier with going slower.  Fortunately I don't *have* to use the Interstate.
