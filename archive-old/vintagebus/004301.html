&gt; If you would get over being full of yourself,

Mmm, yes, you are correct of course. I really should work on that. Soon as I
get through being full of **it. Speaking of which, I have to agree that the
term Westfailure (proper noun) is probably the second most common word in
the English language. And your use of it bothers me none. If I gave a hang
about it, I would have registered it four (4) years ago when I named her
that, at which time I, as well as you, were on the Type 2 list before it
split. The reason I didn't do that is because I thought it sounded a little
affected (as in full of oneself) to name a domain after a pet bus. In
retrospect I see that the two are not mutually exclusive. It is indeed
possible to maintain the purity of being full of oneself and yet still not
commit a certain act that would demonstrate it. In my reality, Westfailure
means a stretched 67 Westy with a 360 horse Chevy V8 and a Ford rearend. In
your reality it means the failure of Western civilization. Of course, how
silly of me not to have seen it at once. I was reading through all of the
pithy economic treatise on your site and I of course felt ridiculous for
having thought that it had anything to do with VW buses.

Humpty Dumpty was pushed. (actually, it was a market correction due to the
unsound equity position of the wall)
