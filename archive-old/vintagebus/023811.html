Subject: 1776 Berg motor help

in my 1964 doublecab i have a Gene Berg 1776 motor--kit #2 i'm told.
about 1500 miles put on in 2 years. motor was assembled by previous
owner who was a vw factory trained mechanic who lived in Utah--now
&quot;Pearl&quot; the 64DC is in Phoenix and 115 degree heat
question #1 of which i get lots of differant answers  valve setting???
.04 or .06?? motor
does not have chrome molly pushrods. timing??? has mild cam--fully
balanced--new case--lower compression--dual Kadrons--main jet size? idle
jet size?  motor runs great now!! has GB dip stick oil sensor, after 1/2
hour driving , still had about 3/8&quot; before contact to light up oil
light, running deep sump--and oil filter 4 3/4 guarts of oil--
would 20/50 weight keep motor happy?? now a tranny question!! &quot;Pearl&quot;
has a 3.88 rancho--the two side plates that hold the axle boots LEAK!!
could be dried up gaskets because truck was not driven much--do not feel
like pulling tranny for just a pair of gaskets--so can i CHEAT and slit
the gaskets to fit onto the tranny and seal with sillycone or some other
sealer?? has anyone tried this short-cut?? results?? or ?? pull tranny
and do it right?? talked to a person who slit 3 gaskets per side,
staggered the slits and used a sealer and never leaked again!! i'm open
to your opinions and or ideas--thanks

1964 VW hearse  1964 VW double cab--and &quot;other&quot; vws-- i drive'm
