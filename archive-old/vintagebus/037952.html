&lt;&lt;Hi David,
Black is what we have and there is a fuse holder at underdash level.  Just 
check the wiring diagrams at Thom's web site for which place to hook it up to 
the main fuse block.&gt;&gt;

The P.O. of my bus claims it came originally with an ambulance fan.
He actually robbed it and sold it seperatly. =(
I believe him since there would be no reason to rob a stock plate as they 
seem to be pretty easy to come accross.
It has a single black wire, no fuse anywhere and it connects to the positive 
side of the wiper switch.
My singlecab (same thing, fan missing, but has wire!) did the same thing, 
down the side and connected to the wiper switch.
