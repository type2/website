&gt; &gt;The &quot;all's well&quot; 12:00 position is correct if the gauges are mounted
&gt; &gt;one above the other, for the same reasons.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a preferred position if you only have one gauge?  Just curious.

No, I guess that comes down to what you would prefer :-)

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm in an ergonomics course this semester, and this is supposedly how
&gt; &gt;they orient all the gauges in them nuclear power plants.
&gt;
&gt;Have they shown you the picture of the nuke plant control room with
&gt;beer tap handles on the control levers yet?  (Reference the book,

Yep.  That was a great idea too.  maybe you should put a heineken handle on 
your hazard switch, and a michelob handle on your headlight switch so that 
you can tell them apart in the darkness just by feel ;-)
(okay, maybe I should pre-empt any &quot;michelob light&quot; comments right here and 
now.)

Ok, bus content now.  For the past two days I have been cutting away rusty 
parts of my bus.  &quot;So what does that leave me with?&quot;  I ask sometimes.  When 
I bought my bus, the rockers on both sides were toast.  Fortunately, some 
donor rocker panels cut from an otherwise straight burned out '67 kombi were 
included by the PO.  The story of that particular bus is a sad one, but I 
won't get into that right now.  I have left the entire rocker assembly 
together, i.e. outer skin, and inner rocker so that I can weld the whole 
thing on.  No sense dissassembling it and then piecing it back together on 
the bus says I.  Anyway, the donor rockers are in pretty good shape, but 
surface rust is beginning on the inside.  Since I don't want to do this 
again in 5 years when the donor rockers rust through, I have been trying to 
figure out the best way to de-rust, and then rustproof these sections.  My 
ideas are as follows:

-take both rocker assembly pieces to get acid dipped, and then galvanized.  
Would the galvanization make it harder to weld them back on?  I'll be using 
a standard 110 lincoln gasless mig, if that means anything.

-have both rocker assemblies sandblasted, and then try to get POR15 into all 
the inside rust hiding places.

I like the acid wash/galvanized idea, but I have no experience with this 
process.  Would it work the way I'm hoping it would?  The main reason I like 
it is because it involves dipping the rockers, and that way the liquid can 
get everywhere (theoretically) and make these rockers last awhile.  Any 
reason why I shouldn't pursue this idea?

Thanks!
