Subject: Re: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

&gt; &gt; I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is
&gt; &gt; positioned a 9 o'clock and another is at about 4 or 5 o'clock. Both have a
&gt; &gt; steel tube attached that is cut-off and bent over to seal it.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; That sounds like an oil pump for a auto-stick bug or KG.  Do you have any way
&gt; to send us an image of it or have a 1968 on type 1 Bentley manual to see if
&gt; it matches the auto-stick oil/hydralic pump?

Yes, I can take a pic and post it. Did the autostick use the engine oil pump to circulate the tranny
fluid?
