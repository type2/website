 The 1964-67
bottle has a black straight surfaced knurled collar that screws to the white
opaque hard plastic bottle.

Sounds like the NOS top I have.  Still working on getting an NOS bottle.

  The pre-1964 bottle has a collar that is black
and triangular in cross section, has scallops cut into it for hand gripping
instead of the knurling, and instead of a long thread to screw on it goes on
like a pharmacy bottle and only turns 1/3 of a turn to open/close.  The
plastic bottle is more translucent, instead of hard white plastic, and is
very flexible, and has a strong smell when near your nose that reminds us of
old collaspable water bottles for camping.

Sounds like it is time to start the search again.  Anyone out there have an NOS pre 64 washer bottle they want to part with?  How did the flexible bottle hold up?  What do they cost if and when you can find them?  Do you ever find them?






you have to decide if it makes a difference to you and decide if
you want to use an early bottle if you can find one, or use a late bottle
till you find a early one.

Well I am trying to go all out to be correct, but I will use what I have until I find the earlier one.


the early
ones are chromed plated machined brass that look like a machine gun turret

These are the ones I have, and mine are pretty nice looking if I remember right.  I'll have to be very careful with them now that I know they are different than the later ones.

Thanks for the info.  The more I find and the more I learn the more parts I need.

Richard
