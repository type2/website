When I went to my local NAPA, they not only did NOT have GL-4, but gave me a 
whole song and dance about how it hasn't been made for years, is NLA, and I 
should buy what they have on the shelf.  So I left, and had to get it clear 
out in Tanglewilde, at the auto parts store near the res..  Al's Auto used to 
carry it, but they got bought up by Schmucks/Kragens/Checker's and have 
changed their product line.

&lt;&lt; Kevin,
 Hop on down to one of your local NAPA auto parts stores.  They sell GL-4 
 by the gallon and it is made by Sta-Lube.  Its around $12 list.  Amsoil 
 also makes a GL-4, but it is synthetic.  A friend of mine put this in 
 his single cab I believe, but I have yet to hear the results.  If I 
 recall correctly its a little more spendy, maybe double the price?  I 
 went with the Sta-Lube.
 I think many of you would be amazed at the parts availability at NAPA or 
 some of your other auto parts chain stores.  Theres a lot of stuff they 
 stock for air cooled dubs, and if they don't stock it, many times they 
 can get it over night.  No affiliation, other than I buy lots of parts 
 from them at work and am pleased with 99% of what they do for me.
