&gt; I didnt that the valves in our busses have interference at any
&gt; position. no?

As you said, some modern engines self destruct when the timing belt breaks
and some are designed not to, but I figured that must've been a newer
development in engines...  I've owned and driven and worked on VWs for
several years now, and there's still a lot I need and want to learn...

Sure will be nice if all that got trashed was just the cam.
