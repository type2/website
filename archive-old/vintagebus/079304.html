Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing r.box core plugs

Hi Tommy,
Wide side toward the brake drum.  We install this spacer (211 501 303) inside 
the already assembled bearing cover and axle seal, and then slide all these 
pieces onto the axle into place after installing the O-ring.  Otherwise we have 
had occasional problems with the axle seal getting distorted when the spacer 
(especially for some reason with the earlier spacer) is installed after the 
bearing cover and axle seal are in place!
