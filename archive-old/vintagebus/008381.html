Jason:
I have no experience but I have an opinion: When you need an engine, you buy
it from Ronnie.
Anyone with any credibility on the list will tell you the same thing.
He'll send you a good new mexi-motor for a fair price, and if you have a
problem, when you call on the phone RONNIE answers, not some anonymous
counter-jockey.
Stay out of the magazines, pay attention to the list.
