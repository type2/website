Subject: Single cab FS at big HWY 5 lot
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was heading down the I-5 Saturday morning (on my way
to pick up a 69 Westy in Yuma, AZ)

And we were just north of the 91 freeway, on the right
(West of the freeway) was a huge car dealer.  I think
it was the used car section of a new dealership. ANd
they have three or four big platforms facing the
freeway, one car on each.

Out of the corner of my eye....no, it can't be...

YES!
There was a single cab on one of the platforms!

It was 2-tone, Light whitish(?) over a sort of khaki
color. Didn't get long enough a look to see early vs.
late, price, etc.

But it was pretty shiny.

If you're heading down the 5 in So. Cal keep an eye
out for it.

Jason
