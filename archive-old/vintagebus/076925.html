I'll second that. and it works great on your real vinyl leatherette seats!  
My 53 sat in the desert for ages, good against rust but the seats got really 
dry.   It has helped restore suppleness to them. In a BIG way.   Unfortunately I 
didn't find out about glycerin until the material on  bottom of the front 
seat was cracked to bits, so it has a cover on that.  Plus glycerin is cheap and 
even good for dry/cracked skin, so no need to worry about getting it on your 
hands, it's a good idea to!

Hi Craig,
Slather on some glycerin onto the rubber and let it set for at least 30 
minutes.  Then wipe off the excess glycerin and enjoy the softer more 
flexible OG 
rubber!  Repeat once or twice a year to keep it that way.  Glycerin is 
availible at any drugstore or chemist as those in the UK would say.
