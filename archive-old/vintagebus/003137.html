&gt; The article is true and VWoA is on the warpath, (check my post on
&gt; trademarks). I got a phone call from a supplier in Colorado and he read me
&gt; the text of the article over the phone. Thank goodness his products are
all
&gt; licensed and Genuine VW,(hence his prices)five minutes later Thom posted
it.
&gt; This has been going on for a while and they are working their way back to
&gt; there motherland after raping the West Coast.

I just bought a T3 &quot;VW&quot; hood emblem from WCM. Is that an infringment?
