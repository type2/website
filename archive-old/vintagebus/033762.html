There is no problem importing vehicals from Japan. My favorite story is of
all the OG 356 Porsche's the Japenese bought before the market got out of
control and when it reached it's peak sold the cars back to the U S at a
very high profit.

http://www.oldcars.co.jp/ is the major one I know about.

I have seen pictures &quot;stolen&quot; from eBay or my site for Buses that have been
purchased by them.

I do not think it is true that cars cannot be brought back because:
1. That sounds like propaganda and
2. I heard mention a year or two ago of someone buying a VW from a Japanese
seller to brought to the USA.

I'm afraid of anyone with a briefcase at a show, money or not.

Regards,
Everett
