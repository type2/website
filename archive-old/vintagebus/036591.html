&gt;  they are at 0.016. Dizzy in car, the little digital dwell / tach thing
&gt;  says right about 0.42.

 are these using the same scale?-  just checking.   leave dizzy in car.  open 
idiot book to adjust points page, open engine compartment, sit on milk crate 
behind bus.  look at cool drawings.   shift into neutral and turn engine 
round with wrench till the little plasticy thing the points ride the dist cam 
is on the point of a dist cam lobe.  wipe the feeler guage on your jeans and 
make sure the .016  fits through just touching each side of the points.  
adjust as needed, recheck, when good, snug down the screw, and recheck.  Then 
adjust timing

&gt;  Thermostat system seems to work great. I watched the little bellows
&gt;  expand as the engine warmed, maybe 5-10 mins. I watched the bellows
&gt;  contract as the engine cooled, much longer.

cool beans!

&gt;  Oil bath air cleaner didn't work out. The fitting for the carb that I
&gt;  have is for an air cleaner on the right side, and my hanging bracket
&gt;  is on the left.  just couldn't make them meet up. 

 the only difference  between 63/64-on the left 1500 aircleaners and 64-67-on 
the right aircleaners is the breathing air tube location- whether the air 
cleaner is on the right or left the air breather tube connection should be 
towards the center of the bus- towards the engine.   So if it is on the left 
you need a long breather tube, like a 40hp. thats the deal  with the 40hp 
style-  the ones with the triangle bracket you attach at the coil screws, I 
have had to make and adaptor piece so THAT kind with the metal tube from carb 
to cleaner lines up right when used on a 1600, but the 1500 kind should fit 
the same- you are using a shortish metal piece on top of the carb, then a 
rubber connector piece, then a metal piece that bolts to the ceiling hanger 
bracket right?  I hope that helps.

&gt;  I have one of those VDO tachometers. So maybe my bus isn't really high
&gt;  tech free. I bought it a while back thinking it was important for
&gt;  something, I forget exactly what. Today I find that while the digital
&gt;  meter says I idle at about 850rpm, the VDO says 1200. I have been
&gt;  concerned about over-revving my engine, since the VDO says maybe
&gt;  4500+rpms at 60mph. But now I don't think so much of the accuracy of
&gt;  the VDO and would like to ditch it.

curiouser and curioser, said Alice

So I ask you volks, who I trust more than cheap electronics
&gt;  (I don't know if it's a compliment either):
&gt;  How fast can I drive my bus?How fast can I cruise my bus on level
&gt;  ground without putting undue wear and tear on that little engine? Is
&gt;  60mph for hours on end a reasonable request?
&gt;  The bus is 1145666 with 15&quot; wheels and a 1600dp single carb motor. No
&gt;  overheating problems or any of that. I have the stock tranny with the
&gt;  RGBs, 
-------------
the little nut or big nut RGBoxes?  the difference is crucial when 
determining speed at rpms safely.    

If you have BigNRGBoxes and a speedo allied to 15&quot; rims, I would say 58 by 
the speedo is good with all 4 wheel the same size.  because my 61 has a 4.37 
r&amp;p, .82 4th, Big NRGBoxes, and does 58mph by the speedo at 3K all 4 wheels 
the same size.   your actual gearing may be different,    taking 58 and mult 
by 1.26 then divide by 1.39 to similate LNRGBoxes the speed would be 52.5mph 
at 3K.  then agin you may have a bug 4th, 52.5 gets dropped to 48.5mph.  
which bites  wheere is that thingy in the archives how to find the gearing by 
spinning the tire /motor? then again those math things never did much for me- 
I find the happy speed by ear.     to me 3K is the happy speed- go just a few 
hundred rpms faster and the engine sounds means it is working mucher harder - 
also it is a good cooling engine speed-
