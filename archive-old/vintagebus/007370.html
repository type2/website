i will be doing my duties at the sema show
empi, saw, scat, bugpack,etc.  this is the social part.
then on to all of my importers ,who also have booths,
this gives me the chance to rag on them about
importing more BUS parts, etc,  then i will talk
to the reps from FAG and SKF about bearings
(why aren't all your bearings made in germany)
yada yada yada, and then on to all the beauty
queens (sighing posters) and to look at all the lastest
and greatest new cars and there accs., more decked
out new beetles then you could imagine.  then on to looking for
new sources for parts ,as all countries are also represented there
i go for 2 or 3 days, but it takes 5 to see it all, like the company that
sells the tools
to make your own cables ( all right 63 and earlier e-brake cables???)
and tons of other stuff, if it's auto related, it's there!!!!!!!!!
next to the tire area, it's huge, will talk to cooper tire, last year they
said they could
make any tire i wanted, minimum 50 to 100 tires (185-15 or 195-15 six plys)
should i step up to the plate??????????
so thats the run down on sema, will try to hook up with Beto for dinner
i love this korean bbq place there, there is a bbq in the middle of the
table
and you cook your food on it, pretty kewl in my opinion.

now on to my new bus, am picking it up on friday due to lack of
a reliable tow vehical (mine), my friend  (i have 1)is letting me use his
1999 F#_at_d
4 door fwd F350 diesel truck to go get it, around 600 miles r/t
at 15 mpg at 75 mph, should be a blast and fast!

the bus is a 1 owner 1965 hardtop deluxe, that was used by a church
since new for it's bussing duties, it has been parked since 1977
when they heard the beginnings of a rod knock, (what do you mean
that you have to check the oil in 12 years), it's all original, faded paint
and all, 3 dents (minor) , and the only rust is at the cargo bulkhead
do to somebody stealing 2 pop-outs and the rain sitting under the floor
mat there, thank god the front sat lower then the rear. middle seat and
drivers side deco stolen as a few other minor parts, original headliner
is perfect, as is front seats and floor mats, only need the middle seat
now, the clamps are all there as are 3 of the beauty rings, will probaly
find the 4th lying around the bus somewhere, according to the owner
the engine has never been removed from bus!!! all parts there, govener
decals on shroud and all, both bumpers, etc. can't wait to get home, as
i have never owned a deluxe and this one needs to be done right,
so it's out of my realm and will be for sale, don't want the vintage na#is
pissed at me for not doing it right, and i like commercial buses anyway,
don't have to worry about beating-em-up, got something to trade!!!!
like a 59 walkthrough double door panel, double cab, don't need
another camper, well maybe a 59-61 flip top westy,

anyway this is about it for now
got some of wolfsburg mirrors in today (brushed aluminum)
arms and clamps
mirrors nice (have vw and vw part # on them
arms look good (proper left and right)
clamps suck (really cheap repo's)
will order some of FLAT four clamps from WCM (stainless and real nice)

thats all volks
lots of new items soon (really)
and tons in stock
