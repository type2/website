Subject: Puyallup Meet camp out!

Hi Volks,
Just in case some of you all are coming out to this meet and need a camping 
place.  The Wetwesties are camping out at Dash Point Park just North of 
Tacoma about 20 minutes away from the Puyallup Fairgrounds where the meet is 
held.  Last year we were the only ones from the Wetwesties that stayed 
overnight at the campgrounds and only two other groups of VW owners showed 
up.  This year the entire Wetwesties group have given up trying to camp at 
the fairgrounds due to Nazi like rules there and no faculties other than a 
grass lawn for the $$ they hassle campers for.  Compared to very nice 
campground with beach and woods to explore.  Plus real restrooms, with 
showers!  All for $8.00 a night.
