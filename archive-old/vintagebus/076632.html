Subject: Re: [VB] Re: How much air ??

There's actually a formula for figuring out proper air pressure.

The two figures on the side wall are the &quot;maximum&quot; ratings, not the
recommended.

Lets say for example, the tires on my 1964 bus are rated 1433lbs _at_ 44psi.
That means, for every 32.5618 lbs, I need 1 psi of air in that tire.
(1433/44)

Unfortunatly, not every state prints out the vehicle weight when state
inspection is completed, so finding out how much weight is on each tire
might be difficult. Our state does, so we're lucky. My 64 Deluxe bus with
all interior in place (plus a tool box to the left in the back, and driver
up front) weighs like this:
          left    right
front  904    838
rear   970    838

Almost a perfect 50/50 weight ratio in this case.
Anyway, by the formula, my pressures should be this:
             left    right
front  27.75    25.73
rear   27.07    25.73

Take into acount for the good chance of extra cargo or passengers, I set
them all at 29-30psi. If going on a camping trip or am planning on being
loaded for whatever other reason, I put the pressure up a bit higher to make
up for the weight. My gas mileage does not change much between runing 44 psi
and 29-30 psi (900 mile round trips are good for finding out things like
this), but the ride sure is a lot better, and how it handles with a sidewind
is better.

To figure your tire pressure, use this formula:
M = maximum wieght rating for tire
P = maximum air pressure rating for tire
W = actual weight on tire
(W/M) x P = recommended pressure setting.

 It is recommended to add a couple pounds to your final figure to make up
for any extra cargo or passengers that may have on occasion.

You can double check this pressure formula against 'normal' cars if they
have stock sized tires on them. Check the vehicle weight in the door jamb,
do the math with the sidewall on the tire, and you'll see it is right in
synch with the pressure the manufacturer recommends. There are exceptions,
like most trucks show the rear tire pressure as the max pressure, most
likley to be ready for carrying a heavy load. A bus owner might want to max
the rear tires out if they plan on hauling heavy loads with any regularity.

Tire pressure is dependant on the weight applied to the tire. I would
venture to say that at least 90% of the cars on the road have overinflated
tires. A lot of people seem to see the words &quot;maximum 44psi&quot; or whatever the
max is, and figure that the tire should be filled with that 44 psi. But read
the fine print on the tire, and it will tell you to check the owners manual
for proper tire pressure. This is plain to see that the tire manufacturers
do not recommend the tires filled to thier max as the recommendation.

The Type 1 Volkswagens (Beetle and Ghia) are relativley light vehicles, and
do not use as much air pressure in it's tires as even the modern &quot;compact&quot;
cars use. Tire pressure is crucial to how a vehicle handles, too much, or
too low of tire pressure can effect the vehicle greatly. And with the
(roughly 40/60) weight ratio of a Type 1 (light front end), and for
swingaxle VW's, correct tire pressure is very important for handling and
saftey.

Most people get numbers they think are too low, and wont try it. Too bad.
One example to me is, look at the Ford Explorer fiasco of a few years back.
Tire pressure was recommended to be 26 psi in the Explorers running the
Firestone 235/75R15. In 7 years of running an maintanence shop, I NEVER had
anyone that thought 26psi was good, and insisted on us setting them to the
max of 35 psi.  All those Explorers running on tires that were 35%
overinflated. Is it just a coincedence that most Explorers were running
overinflated tires, and the tires on the Explorer were having troubles?
Honestly, Firestone and Ford are probably the only people that know for
sure. Whatever the case, it's obvious overinflation did not help the
situation.
