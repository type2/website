 OK... been puttin up with this since I got the truck
('62 S/C)... On a hard take off, not tire smokin or
nothin, just a hard acceleration from a dead stop, or
takin off pullin a heavy load, why does it wheel hop
so bad? Its all stock.... not lowered, or raised. Does
it have anything to do with the drive axles turnin
backwards, is it just a truck thing, or am I way
off... The real question is there anything that can be
installed to prevent it. Its really annoying. 
 I know, alot of questions, but please bear with me...
these buses are a &quot;little&quot; different from B*gs&lt;LOL&gt;
Thanks,
