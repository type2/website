Subject: Re: [VB] What size radial tire ???????

While these are one size small, they are the correct size for bays and
vanagons, and are often used on splitties with 14&quot; wheels.

http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/index.jsp?autoYear=1979&amp;autoMake=Volkswagen

Go to the above link, use the vehicle model menu to go to 'Vanagon Camper',
and then click on the '185/-14' link.


There are some load range C and D reinforced tires on this page, starting
at only $45 (plus shipping) for a Continental!
