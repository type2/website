&gt; Does anyone know where I can find a rebuild kit for my '67 master cylinder?

Hi Gene,
Check out Hemmings Motor News for places that will bore out your old 1967 MC, 
and install a pressed in brass, bronze, or best yet stainless steel liner 
into it.  Then it will last just about forever unless you fill it wil 
sulfuric acid.
  Or check out the 1972 and later bus MC for pre-1968 buses article that we 
wrote up in the type2 library.  The only drawback for this conversion is the 
brakes are require 7 or 14% more pedal pressure, but only costs about $50.00 
including some junkyard parts.
