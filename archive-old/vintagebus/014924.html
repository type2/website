&gt;  --- I used a GPS device that I have a lot of experience with, so
&gt; expect
&gt; the MPH figures to be VERY ACCURATE.

Well, with Selective Availability still on, they will be good to +/-
2MPH or so.

&gt;  --- The rear tires are 185R14 brand new tread and pumped up at
&gt; 50PSI.

Tire sizes vary.  What we need is the distance travelled per
revolution.  Mark the tire and ground, move the bus forward one turn
(ten would be better) and measure the distance travelled along the
ground.

&gt;  --- I have a 1967 Westy with large nut redux boxes (1.25 ratio,
&gt; right?)
&gt;  --- The RPM gauge is a 1 year old Suntac that I hooked-up.  Who
&gt; knows if
&gt; it is correct.  Seems right at idle... if the numbers don't jive,
&gt; let's take
&gt; a closer look at it :)

I wish you would have asked before BBB, I would have brought along my
digital lab strobe so that we could have checked it!

&gt;  --- I spent at least 30 seconds at that exact speed and RPM to make
&gt; sure
&gt; that the GPS was right on and that I was getting as close as possible
&gt; on the
&gt; numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is what I found:
&gt; 
&gt;  ==== 4th Gear ====
&gt; 
&gt;  2500 RPM I was going 40MPH
&gt;  3100 RPM I was going 50MPH
&gt;  3700 RPM I was going 60MPH
&gt;  4000 RPM I was going 65MPH
&gt; 
&gt;  ==== 3rd Gear ====
&gt;  2500 RPM I was going 28.5MPH
&gt;  2650 RPM I was going 30MPH
&gt;  3100 RPM I was going 35MPH
&gt;  3575 RPM I was going 40MPH
&gt;  4000 RPM I was going 47MPH

Numbers seem OK, except for the last reading.  It yields an RPM/MPH
ratio of 85 where the other numbers give numbers around 88-89 for 3rd
gear.

Get out the ruler and let's see what the other numbers boil down to!
