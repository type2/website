Thank you list for all the great suggestions.  I believe now (after hearing 
from the list) that the problem is with the length of the rod that goes into 
the Master cylinder.   I dont belive that there is any freeplay in the pedal 
(this is a new vehicle to me so I don't know all the settings on it yet).  
When the brakes did lock up, it was all 4 that locked up.   I went to the 
back drivers side tire and loosened the bleeder valve and all 4 brakes 
released.

So, tonight I will go and adjust the rod length so the master cylinder 
travels the entire stroke and there is about 1/8 freeplay.

Can anyone explain why the master cylinder only releases pressure at the end 
of travel (i.e. no compression of the cylinder)?  Is there some kind of 
orafice that the piston passes only at this location that allows for fluid 
release?  Just my curiosity getting the best of me!

I will report back tomorrow on what I find under the bus!

Thanks Again,
Mike Lynch

Folks
A little thoughtful troubleshooting will go far here.

On a single circuit system a hose problem will provbably be just affecting
one wheel, a MC problem should be affecting all of the wheels.
On a Dual system with 2 ports being used a MC problem should affect just
the fronts or rears and a brake hose just one wheel.
On a dual system which uses 3 ports (ex 68-69 type MC) If both rears are
affected it should be a MC problem if one rear then a hose. The fronts
although they are on the same  circuit have 2 seperate holes for release
so any combination of problems in the front could be either hose or MC.

Thinking about it a second could save a little trial and error time.
cheers
