Subject: Brake Pedal won't go down. Brakes are smokin'

I have a brake problem that I haven't seen addressed directly in the
library...Here's what happens.
Tonight driving back from the office, I noticed at a red light that the
brake pedal wouldn't go down no matter how hard I stepped on it. Soon after
that I smelled something cooking, my driver's side front brake I suspect.
Drag on the bus for the last couple blocks was pretty noticable. This should
be elementary for you veterans, I looked for this condition in the Muir book
but couldn't find it.
Seized wheel cylinder? Collapsed hose? Fried brake shoes?
I've been reading the brake threads the last few days, and agree that this
is no area to experiment with, so I'd like some tips...
