Happy Friday everyone,

I've been waiting to post this question to the list.  I have a single car 
garage at my house that I am outfitting to be the new home for my bus.  It's 
small, but it's what I have.  I'd like to build a workbench in the back of 
the garage that will span its width (prolly around 10-12 feet).  The bench 
will be used for all kinds of repair (I hope to rebuild my front end this 
summer, for example) so I want to build it sturdy.  What do y'all have for 
workbenches?  Am I best off building my own, or is there someone that makes 
a nice bench/table of this size at a reasonable cost?  Is there anywhere on 
the web, or books/magazines containing plans to build your own?  Any advice 
and BTDT's would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Mike A.
