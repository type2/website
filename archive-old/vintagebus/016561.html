To the Friendly and Knowledgeable List Members,

In the spirit of overhauling voltage regulators and rebuilding fuel
pumps; 
here is some old school tuneup tips using the ubiquitous vacuum gauge.

Why post this to the vintage bus list? Because our demographic
is the least likely to be owners of engines with long overlap cams
or smog and EFI stuff  that mess up gauge readings. 

This is a compilation of about five or so old instruction sheets and
repair manuals.
There is a section in Tom Wilson's How to rebuild VW air cooled engine
that use the vacuum gauge.
(This book rates right up there with the idiot book, how to hot rod vw
engines by B. Fisher,  Service Repair Manuals by Bentley, etc.)
I've tried, by using Wilson's specs and other vw repair books to avoid
American V8 bias
and adjust the readings to reflect that of a volks.

These readings are analogous to medical lab tests  such as,
titers for viral infections or ESR testing. 
The results are going to vary from individual to individual
and will tell if a patient is getting sicker or how the body is
performing 
relative to itself and changes in it's environment. 

Ergo, like head temps in air cooled engines the readings are not
definitive
but very helpful in  trouble shooting.
Please forgive the cryptic nature of the rest of these notes,
but I've typed enough as it is.

Thanks for staying with me so far.
Here Goes!

General formula:
Atmospheric Pressure - Pressure inside intake manifold = Gauge reading in
&quot; Hg

adjustments for elevation:
Zero to 2000 feet above sea level is Okay; if &gt;2k then 1&quot;/1k' elevation
increase

attach gauge down stream of throttle plate

ENGINE FAULT / SYMPTOMS AND GAUGE READINGS:

Normal Engine: 18&quot;-22&quot;Hg, 6-4 cly. engines lower (again V8 bias)
valve overlap needle causes needle fluctuations; constrictor valves are
placed in the gauge hose barb (.015&quot; on mine) or pinch hose until
fluctuations go away.

Sticky Valves: rapid intermittent drop (each time the valve is suppose to
close)
	-spray penetrating oil on stem or in intake tract to see if valve
	unsticks and reading returns to normal
	-pull plug wire, no RPM change?

Ignition Miss: see sticky valves

Weak or Broken Valve Spring: fluctuates rapidly between 10&quot;-20&quot; Hg at
2,000 RPM;
	weak springs, &quot;Hg goes up as RPM goes up, 
	Broken springs; rapid fluctuations every time valve attempts to close
	(even at 	idle)

Worn Valve Guides: Lower than normal reading with fast fluctuations of &quot;3
Hg on each 	side of reading with engine idling, pointer steadies out as
RPM increases
	Readings at idle 14&quot;-19&quot; Hg

Leaking valve: point will drop 1&quot;-7&quot; Hg at *regular*intervals, burnt
valve; regular drop of 	aprox. 5&quot; Hg (think- tight valve clearance?)

Intake manifold leaks:3&quot;-9&quot; Hg Below normal; change leak, spray carb
cleaner at 
	suspected leak, if RPM increases, it's a leak.

Late Valve Timing: 8&quot;-15&quot; Hg at idle

Late Ignition Timing (or uniformly close valve clearance): 14&quot;-17&quot; Steady
 

Poor Compression, piston ring defects: open throttle, increase to 2k RPM
	close quickly, should jump 2&quot;-5&quot; Hg or more if rings good,
	drops almost zero if bad

Blown Cylinder Head Seal: Drops 10&quot; Hg each time cylinder fires at all
RPMs

Spark Plug Gaps Set Too Close: floating between 19&quot;- 16&quot; Hg

Incorrect Idle  Air - Fuel Mixture; floating between 13&quot; -17&quot; Hg (slowly)
or slowly down to a 	lower reading, adjust to highest value.

Restricted Exhaust System: Incase to 2k RPM, close throttle quickly
	-normal; drop to 2&quot; Hg then back to 25&quot; Hg quickly (normally quick)
	-choked exhaust; 
		not more than 5&quot; Hg greater (compared to 25&quot;)than normal &quot;Hg and
	 	seems to stop momentarily in it's return to a normal reading =
		partial restriction

		Slow drop to zero &quot;Hg = choked exhaust

Choke Test: (Ignition off, no throttle) turn starter, gauge should
increases to 18&quot;-21&quot; Hg,
	 if low, check for manifold leaks, throttle failing to close fully

Fuel Pump Test: Run engine on  carb float bowl gas, put gauge in tank
side of fuel pump
	- should go up to 10&quot; Hg

Gas Line test; same test, put gauge at petcock (reserve)end of gas line

That's all Volks!
Aloha 
Ken
