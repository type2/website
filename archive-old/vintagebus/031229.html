Subject: touch ups

I went down to the local paint place out of curiousity yesterday.  There 
are a few spots on my 62 that could use touching up due to chips and 
scratches and what not, and I would like to fix some of the deeper ones. 
  Some just add character :)  Anyways, I had the lady look up L380 
Turquoise for me.  She had to dig out this old book with pages and pages 
of auto paint chips for cross reference.  After some real digging, we 
found it.  It was actually in her computer too, but she just wanted to 
make sure it was correct.  The book listed it as a color for 59-61 and 
we were looking in the 62-64 section...  I was quite suprised they had 
that information there.  I guess they do a lot of classic cars, so they 
use those books a good bit.  They do work for people from CA to NY, out 
of a little city here in Wisconsin...  Tower Paint, maybe some of you 
might know of it???  Anyways, I put in my order just for a 16oz spray 
can of paint.  She says it will be *exact*.  For touch up I can just 
spray it into a dish or plate or something and put it on.  For other, 
larger, areas I can spray it on.  I have no need to do that now though...

What is the best way to blend in the paint either for a large or small 
area?  I'm not familiar with painting practices... so I'm not really 
sure what to do.  I'd like to make it the least noticable as possible, 
so that it blends right in with the shine and everything.  If anyone 
could let me know, that'd be great.

By the way, it cost $15.70 with tax for the can of paint.  I put in for 
my order yesterday and she says it should be done Monday.  I guess they 
get pretty busy.  Who knew?!
