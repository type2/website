Subject: RE: [VB] Side Tents for $49!  UPDATE

Well, our site got hammered, and we've already sold out of the $49
factory-second tents. Wow, that was fast!  If you ordered one, and we
haven't already called or emailed you to inform you that we had to
cancel your order, then we expect to be able to fill your order. They
should all be shipped by Friday. Congrats to those who were quick with
the mouse. :-) 

We do have a few of the $79 budget-priced awnings left, though (see
below).  They are likely to sell out pretty quickly, too, so hurry if
you're interested.  Thanks, and have a happy and safe New Year!!!

&gt; On a similar note, we have a few of our $79 budget-priced awnings
left, 
&gt; and need to clear them out as well to make room for the upcoming new 
&gt; model. These are brand new stock, NOT seconds, and are $79. The
&gt; optional side wall, which was originally $50 extra, is now $19.95 with

&gt; purchase of the awning, so you can get the whole package for under
$100.
&gt; (Or order two side walls, and the awning can be enclosed on all but
one 
&gt; side, almost like a tent.) The side walls simply attach with velcro
loops
&gt;  when desired.
