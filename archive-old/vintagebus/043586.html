&gt;My ignition coil slipped from it's bracket and started shorting
&gt;(sparking) with my intake manifold while the engine was on.  The
&gt;positive lead wire to the coil slipped off and the engine stopped. 
&gt;While I was seeing all this going on (I was back looking in the
&gt;compartment by now) I noticed electrical smoke in the cab but do not
&gt;know exactly where from.  Now, I got everything back together but my
&gt;horn, wipers, and turn signals do not work!  All of my fuses are good. 

If you're really sure that the far right fuse is good, look at the top
terminal for that fuse.  See that really fat red wire?  That's probably
your problem.  Either that or you have bad connections at the fuse
block, like from the back where the push-ons are to the front where the
fuse clips are.

Another tip: If you give the year, model, and US or Europe when asking
electrical questions, you will get more precise answers.  :)
