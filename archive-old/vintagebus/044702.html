Hi there--
You are supposed to have 15&quot; tall by 4.5&quot; wide. These rims have 4 more 
notable &quot;slots&quot; on the outside of the center. The 14&quot;s are from 63? on and 
make it alot easier  to find a good stiff sidewalled LT tire. The 15's on the 
other hand are very hard to find a tire for (Ask me all about it---even w/ 
alot of advice, I'm still scared to order tires. I'm gonna do it this weekend 
!). 

BTW-- would the 205/75/15 fit my 59's wheel wells for sure ? Any other 
advice? I know Ive prob already asked numerous times . . . just want to be 
sure . . .(E+B?)
