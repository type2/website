&gt;I didn't test anymore but it isn't looking too good. Last hope is that
&gt;the wire is bad or the ground on the motor isn't doing it's thing.
&gt;Worst case is that I got to find another wiper motor or something.

Pull it and take it apart...the cover over the windings comes off just
like a valve cover and you can check out the brushes, etc.  See if you
can spin the armature with your fingers - maybe the grease in the gearbox
is too old and thick, or maybe the shaft is rusted.  The gearbox comes
apart too, but make sure you find _all_ the small parts - there's a tiny
shim or thrust washer on one of the shafts.
