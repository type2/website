Subject: Owners rights.....

I received an &quot;anonymous&quot; (no name, just the email addy) email today
from a list member telling me that I was basically an a$$hole for
selling *my*, repeat *my* '56 Single to someone who will most likely
send it overseas. I know this is touchy ground with alot of you, but
when I get offered my asking price for a car, I'm selling it. I don't
care where it goes. I know some people get attached to their cars. I
have a couple myself I would never sell no matter what the price. Those
are my &quot;keepers&quot; not the cars I sale for a living. But would it really
make sense to tell someone you aren't going to sell them something
because of where it's going to end up?

I was also told I was an a$$hole for wanting to make my '59 Westy look
earlier............ Who cares I'm still doing it, and if I sell it and
the guy (asian, german, african, who cares!!) with the big bank account
wants it to look like a '59 I can bolt the OG bumpers, tail lights and
decklid back on. No harm done!

No flame suit required, I can take the heat.
