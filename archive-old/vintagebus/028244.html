Subject: [VB] update - Tom Good in Vermon 

At the risk of pointing out something seemingly obvious, I hope Tom or
anyone else on the list
that might build one of these things be very, very careful lest a
weldpoint may snap. Just hope
nobody puts themselve under it or even near where that weight might
swing should something bust
loose. Other than that. . . looks like a great idea. In fact, I want
one!!!
