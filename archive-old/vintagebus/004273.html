Don't forget the NQ admonition:  Use Parafin and a Torch.

Chris
&gt;
&gt; &gt; That's a common problem.  I just went thru this last
weekend, luckily vice
&gt; &gt; grips worked for me.  I've seen everything from liquid
wrench to torches to
&gt; &gt; cutting to get these things off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I've fixed this several different ways...
&gt;
&gt; I've used a cut-off tool (whizzer wheel) to cut the
bushing/tube lengthwise then
&gt; use a cold chisel to cut the last bit and pry it off.
&gt;
&gt; Another time I liberally doused the stud and bushing with
PB Blaster for 2-3
&gt; days.  Works great if you have the time...
&gt;
&gt; I've also applied heat from a propane torch for 10
minutes.  After bushing is
&gt; nice and hot, douse with cold water.  Repeat this (heat,
then rapidly cool) a
&gt; couple times. This usually breaks the rust.   Finally heat
a bit then use the
&gt; vice grips to &quot;unscrew&quot; the bushing off.
&gt;
&gt;     Hope at least one method works for you...
