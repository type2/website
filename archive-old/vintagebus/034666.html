Subject: Beetle Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I know this in no way belongs on the TYPE 2 list but here goes:
I need a speedo for my beetle.
I want a kilometer one.
I wasn't sure whats correct.
Its a 59 beetle.
Clear needle I can guess. Is it 0-100? 0-120?
Anyone have such a speedo correct for a 59 beetle?
It can be less than perfect.
Thanks-
Greg
