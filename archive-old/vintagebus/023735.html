Subject: Sunroof help.

Can anyone tell me what type of screw that golde (VW) used to fasten the
sunroof losking hook to the  lock mechanism?  It looks to be some sort
of large diameter, short thread (5 or 6mm) screw.  I can rig something
up, but thought maybe someone out there has a unit they could look at
for me so i can get the right screw in there.

Clara, would you possibly know this?

Thanks

Matthew
