Subject: Re: [VB] re: International shipping

There is a *major* misunderstanding by the general public just
what constitutes 'clearance' of a check.  You can take one of these
checks, deposit it in the bank, and within a few days your bank will
tell you it's 'cleared' if you were to ask them. However, it takes
a while for it to really *clear*.  This delay is what is working in
the scammer's favor.  On top of that, in most instances of this
scam, they want you to *wire* funds (the change) - you can't reverse
the wire transfer.  It's akin to writing a bad check for cash - lots
of cash.

&gt; check given to him for a computer once.  He gave the merchandise to the
&gt; buyer (in person transaction) because the checked looked (and was
&gt; legit).  Only problem was that it was stolen!  When he went to B of A
&gt; they told him it was no good.  He was hosed big time!
&gt; 
&gt; Just make sure the money is in your account.
