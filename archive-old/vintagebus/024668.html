I read the report that apparently Josh died from CO2 emmissions. Could it 
have been accidental?? He seemed to be so full of life, so full of 
happiness and love, it is very hard to understand how this could be.

I didn't even know him, but I sure wish I had.

I think a fitting memorial for BBTA would be an annual case lighting.
