Subject: Re: [VB] new window seals, glue???

how temporary is that.... could be a while... I know how those things go.  I 
was going to paint my 61, and didn't replace all those window side/ corner 
window seals, then ~7 years later I finally do the seals, a year ago?  Well still 
one corner and one pop out to do) 
and the bus still isn't painted.


I never use glue, I use roofing tar spread on the bottom ledge and corners 
thinly.    It can be cleaned off with gasoline or wd-40 or similar solvent 
before painting is done.

With sekurit glass you can pop the window out and reuse the seal.   I did 
this with the back window of my 65 westy when it got real paint.  I used an NOS 
seal with molded corners and it was a blessed joy to use.   And to reuse.

In fact if you got to costco in your friend's bug, and he ends up getting a 
large floor jack and one of those shelter things for his bus and other large 
things and you get back to the car and you realise there are too many package to 
fit on the roof rack and it's too long to fit in the bug you can kick the 
back window out and have the boxes sticking out hte back window hole, 

and he can put the rear window back in later.

 But it you do that w/ laminated/sigla glass you tend to break the glass.

hi all, i just got my order in. i ordered my 2 front windshield seals and my 
rear window seal. my question is, is it ABSOLUTELY necessary for me to use 
window rubber glue for the seals? im going to just use these seals till i get 
enough money to get my bus painted, then im going to replace all of them again. 
so these are temporary seals. thanks in advance.
