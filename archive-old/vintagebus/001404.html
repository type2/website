Hey all,

	I just got back from the Golden Gate Chapter of VVWCA meeting.

Kelly Park details -

	All new rules still apply.  If you want to park your inside the park, you
will need to 'show' the car or be a swapper.  There is no general or 'club
parking' inside the gates.  'Show'-ing the car means that you must park in
your Type area.  It doesn't matter if you have a slammed panel or a rusted
out Singlecab, you will be parked with the rest of the busses in the Type II
Class.  There will be no 'modified' award classes, so your slammed bus will
have to 'compete' with all the rest of the busses. (This applies to all type
vehicles, bugs, type 3s, things)   Show categories for Type IIs are Luxury
Class and Working Class.  My advice is if you want to hang with your
buddies, make sure they are in the same Type Class and you all enter at the
same time.

	I asked Rick Spohn about trailers.  He said that small trailer that are
obviously part of your show vehicle are okay, but it will still be at their
discretion to let it in, due to space limitations.

	This year the Golden Gate chapter has already had meetings with the San
Jose Police and Fire Marshals, Phelon Avenue will be barricaded so as to
prevent disturbing the residents that live on that street.  There will still
be only the single entrance into the park and lining up for entrance will be
on Senter.  There will be no line queuing in the lower parking lot as was
done last year.  In fact, that parking lot will be inaccessible until the
morning of the Event.

	Just to prep you, the show area for the type 2s is the back corner
(Northeast corner?) running along the back road.  The swap area will remain
basically the same. except the area where clubs used to gather is now part
of swap row.

	Additional info at http://www.ggcvvwca_dot_org/ComingEvents/KelleyPark/kp.html

	That's about it.  I hope this helps.

Remember that the Red Barn/BYOB Event is the SATURDAY April 21st the day
before Kelly Park.  There will be camping available for Friday Night, but
NOT for Saturday Night.  Strictly Vintage IIs will host a casual bus show
with original and fun awards.  Additionally, there will be a raffle for
prizes donated by local shops and clubs!  See you there!
