Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt; mused:
&gt; I saw a RiceBoy yesterday with a boot-like device
&gt; akin to the club.
&gt; This was a self-imposed booting - I watched him
&gt; install it!

I had a set of these back in high school.  I think it
was called a &quot;spider&quot; and they worked great!  A friend
of mine had two of them as well.  When we road tripped
up to NYC, we (my buddy, me and 4 of our friends)
piled into his loaf, booted the bus when we got up
there, and didn't get towed or booted by New York
City's finest the entire weekend!  I think because the
boot was impossible to get off unless you had a plasma
cutter or some blowtorch setup on-board!
