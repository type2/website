They are called kalahari. Not sure if they ship overseas. Seems unlikely cos
I suspect that most of their stuff prolly comes from the States anyway. I
think that they are an amazon associate or something because the pre
discount prices are close to the dollar prices on amazon. The writeup for
the Bentley is at:

The South African Rand (no we don't trade with peacock feathers) trade at
about 6 to 1 to the Dollar.
  
Thanks to all those who responded to my ISBN Q.

Later
