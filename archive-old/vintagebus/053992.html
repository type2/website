Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

I smacked my nose with one of those 4-way lug wrenches one time,
gave it a good spin and *BLAM* - right in the nose!  My nose has
never been the same since then, either, I think I messed it up somehow.

&gt; Last night I was working on the engine and had my left arm across the top when my steel watchband crossed the terminals on the alternator. It welded the links together and burnt my right thumb while I was trying to rip it off my wrist. A 3&quot; by 1&quot; patch of skin came off as one piece, except for the skin that came off today all crackly. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Of course, my busspouse was standing there and thought I was gonna lose my arm.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the dumbest thing I've done since when I was trying to get an old tie rod off and was banging on a prybar, I hit myself square on the forehead with a four pound sledge. My wife missed that one, but later had to ask why I had a big knot on my head.
