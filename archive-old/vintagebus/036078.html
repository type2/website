I am sure that was the name in the 70s.....way before Jeff Walters

but Jeff did  start &quot;one eyed duck&quot;

and who in the hell started  &quot; jealousy &quot; windows ?  
when I told that   to Jeff he just stared ! 
he had no idea what I was talking about.........

Anyone know when the SOTO meet is ???????
