&lt;mazzie_at_sierra_dot_net&gt; (Mike &amp; Sarah Mazzie) asked:

&gt;&gt;I was about to do the valves for the first time on my '63 bus (40hp)
&gt;&gt;and I see in the official VW workshop manual that it calls for .008
&gt;&gt;on the intake valves and .012 on the exhaust valves.

It depends on the rocker arm setup that your engine has.  If the rocker 
arm supports have bevelled edges, and a slit in them, then the correct
adjustment is .004&quot; for both intake and exhaust.

But if the rocker arm supports have a solid square cross-section, then 
the correct adjustment is .008&quot; for the intake valves and .012&quot; for the 
exhaust.  This is the less common of the two types, but you could 
possibly have it.

Taking advantage of the loosening of the list rules on Friday, and
hoping that he doesn't start a flame war, the ex-VW mechanic states his
opinion, while working on his third cold one of the evening:

&gt;&gt;That differs greatly from Muir who basically says .006 all around. 
&gt;&gt;Who's right? 

Muir's book is helpful, but it's not the word of God.  He wrote for 
people who had limited resources, in terms of professional tools and 
experience, but who wanted to maintain their VWs themselves.

Some of his techniques are clever innovations that enable the average
driver to effectively make various repairs. 

But some of what he says is pure crap.

In no case would I follow his advice if it contradicted a genuine
factory manual.  Volkswagenwerk A.G. was deeply rooted in the German
cultural traditions of thoroughness and accuracy, and its shop manuals,
while not perfect, are very reliable.

When the late model engines were introduced, the factory recommended
valve adjustment was .004&quot; for both intake and exhaust valves.  Dealers
in the U.S. found that American drivers experienced burned valves much
more frequently than European drivers.  Some of the reasons for this
included the following:

o Many owners didn't properly maintain their vehicles, and were much 
  less fastidious than their European counterparts in having their cars 
  serviced at recommended intervals.  In particular, many of them didn't
  change the oil and have the valves adjusted on schedule.

o Many VW engines were routinely subjected to heavy loads for which 
  they were not designed:

  + Aftermarket air conditioning units, while not recommended, were
    very popular in southern states.

  + Some drivers used their VWs to pull trailers.

  + The abomination known as the automatic stick shift made its 
    appearance in the U.S. market.

o Prolonged high temperatures in the summer are more common in parts of 
  the U.S. than in Northern Europe.  Engines that run hot are more 
  prone to burn valves and suffer other failures.

In response to this situation, Volkswagen of *America* changed their 
recommended valve clearance to .006&quot;, without making *any* change in 
engine design.  The theory was that since most drivers didn't get the 
valves adjusted, they'd tighten up, so the extra .002&quot; of clearance
meant that fewer owners would complain about burned valves, because 
they still had some clearance.

But, .006&quot; is not what the designers intended.  Opening up the 
clearance reduces engine efficiency, because the valves are open for a 
shorter duration.  It's kind of like installing an &quot;un-performance&quot; 
camshaft.  The result is a loss of mileage and horsepower, and possibly 
an increase in valve train wear, due to excessive slack.

What to do?  Set your valves to .004&quot;, and be sure to adjust them every
3.000 miles.  That and changing your engine oil at the same interval
are both the least expensive and the most effective things you can do to
keep your VW running for a long time.

I've driven several engines well over 100,000 miles following this 
regimen, without any significant engine problems [footnote 1].  This is 
in Houston, Texas, where the temperature is frequently over 100F in 
the summer [footnote 2].

\end{soapbox}

As I said at the top, I don't mean to start a flame war with this 
diatribe.  If you disagree, that's fine, but please do so politely! -;)

Cheers, Bill

[footnote 1] Not counting the time I drank Jack Daniels all night, with 
             Lone Star beer chasers, and then proceeded to engage 2nd
             gear instead of 4th while accelerating downhill on a
             freeway.  That tore the flywheel half way off the
             crankshaft!

[footnote 2] High quality SAE40 oil, full flow oil filters, oil coolers,
             and air scoops also help contend with summer heat, but
             that's a topic for another day.
