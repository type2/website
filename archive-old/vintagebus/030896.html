Subject: [WetWesties] '57 panel for sale
Message-ID: &lt;3AE73D43_at_webmail&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all:
My neighbor has decided to sell her blue '57 panel with double pair of
cargo doors. It still has the original Hella 3rd brake light, both pressed
bumpers and  a nicely done wood veneer interior. Very little rust, considering
the age of the vehicle: some bubbles below the cargo doors on one side, and
quite a bit at the front floor. The cargo floor is really dry,amazingly
enough. The bus has one of those vintage search spot lights attached to its
roof, which can be guided from the cabin. Paint is bad outside, but original
and shiny inside. It has some non original lights added in the rear (common
problem). Has (according to the owner) a very recently rebuilt 1600 with dual
Delortos, new tranny and brakes. Transmission from those guys in Bend, OR with
such a good reputation, the name escapes my senile memory right now...She said
the bus runas great. All this is from a 5' inspection I did today, I'm sure I
am missing details.
She wants $5,000. A lot of money, but this is a rare bus plus she might be
flexible, who knows.
I can get her phone number if anyone is interested.
