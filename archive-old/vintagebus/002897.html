&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know of a source for the net that goes in the back cargo area of a

&gt; &gt; &gt; Westy interior.

&gt; &gt; I thought only 1969 pop top Westies had them......
&gt; &gt; Does a split window Westy have them??   Never seen one.....
&gt;
&gt; I think the answer is no.  But.....if you want to use one out of an early bay,
&gt; you just need to install the snaps.  I think they are a very close match,
&gt; since the hatches of the late splits and early bays are the same.
&gt;
&gt; Look on E-Rip Off auctions.  I seem them all the time.

Now you are talking of the bug screen.
I was thinking the other person was asking about the cargo net that is in the
upper rear section of a 69 Westy.
