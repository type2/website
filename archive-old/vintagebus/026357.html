When I was in Japan in 1993 on a business trip, I was overwhelmed by the
Japanese love for automotive clubs and organizations. There is a devoted
club for every make including VW. I susbcribided to CAR Magazine, a
Japanese mag nearly an inch thick,$140 Us a year sub rate, lasted one
year only) which covers many old models and their clubs.  Ads run by
companies promoting VW type 1 and 2 are scattered through the mag.  One
issue had a report on 60 or so type 1 and 2 meeting. the color spread
focused on a split window shorty bus that had been reduced in length buy
a  few feet. The rest of the busses were all unmodified, as were many of
the type 1. VWs are collector cars in Japan. British, German, French and
Italian cars are well represented . Yes, you can insure a left hand dive
car in Japan, as a matter of fact, some cars are not avalable in RHD.
BMW comes to mind.
