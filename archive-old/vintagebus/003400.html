Well, actually that's what it is. Window in a back hatch on my Explorer is
frameless and has this seal around. It hungs on two hinges and has one lock
in the middle. The whole thing is sealed well and has never leaked, well, so
far. I don't think it would be that big of a deal to design something
similar except that windshield should be made from laminated glass. I'm not
sure if I want to start from scratch and do it all but to retrofit safaris
with different seal might be in the works. Frameless safaris? I don't think
it would look good. Just my opinion.

Later,

&gt; &gt;Makes me thinking. What about seals that F*rd is using on rear hatch
&gt; windows
&gt; &gt;on the Explorer? I got one of these. With a little work these might fit
the
&gt; &gt;safaris well. Do we have to go with what they sell us? Heck no, just keep
&gt; &gt;trying the alternatives. I will try for sure and see how this will work.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good idea Andre - if this this works, let me know.  I want to try my idea
of
&gt; a frameless glass.  I'll try to work on this design in my spare time...
