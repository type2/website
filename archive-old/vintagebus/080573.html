Subject: RE: [VB] Something broke....

Had somthing similar happen last Sunday on the way to work, stopped for gas, 
went to restart and BANG! Tack-Tack-Tack-Tack.  Trailered home and found a 
sparkplug had blown out, swapped out heads for spare set of 041's I had, 
have less power now than before but higher oil pressure and lower operating 
temps.  WTF? (Please pardon the insinuation of profanity by way of acronym)  
Probably dropped CR but haven't had time to check compression.  Tomorrow I 
promise.
