Subject: Re: [VB] Windshield Wiper and Washer Info

6V motor fed 12V turns twice as fast, not slower. Up until yesterday
mine went too fast, kept throwing the pass side linkage, bought an $8
resistor from FLAPS and now it is peachy keen. Cleaning up commutater
and regreasing gears sped the motor back up a little, could be this is
your problem?
Anybody know if those little &quot;bushing caps&quot; (only seen them in
Bentley) that go on the wiper shafts are available?

This may be a dumb question – but I can’t find a manual washer pump
(the
rubber part) for my 65 Sundial in any of the parts lists.  Any
suggestions
where to purchase?

Also – my wipers run R-E-A-L  s-l-o-w   – I believe the PO (took me a
while
to figure out that acronym!) didn’t convert the wiper motor to 12v
when he
converted it.  What is the recommendation?  Should I put a “reducer”
on it
and run the existing wiper motor – and will it help the speed?  Or is
there
another option?  How difficult is this?

Brings up another point – my hazards don’t blink – the big red light
left of
the steering column comes on steady.  Is this a 6v-12v related
problem?  Any
thoughts?

Thanks –
