Subject: Re: [VB] Roof Rack Locks

&gt;Hiya list,
&gt;Does anyone know of a lock for the early bus racks, the ones with the
&gt;horseshoe-type clamps?  Since they have a wingnut bolt that screws down into
&gt;the clamp, I can't use the normal types of locks.
&gt;
&gt;My son's 66 Sundial has a half-rack, the same kind of early rack as mine.
&gt;It has a link of chain welded to each of the wingnut screws, and a lock
&gt;placed thru the link of chain and locked onto the foot of the rack.  Pretty
&gt;simple, but it works.  I'd like to be able to disuade thiefs with bolt
&gt;cutters as well.  Any suggestions?
&gt;

I'll probably get blasted for this, but here goes....................

If somebody wants your rack / stereo / chrome hubcaps / etc. No matter 
how well you *think* you have them secured, you will come out to your 
car some time and find them gone.

The problem with &quot;locking&quot; them to your Bus / Bug, is your not looking 
at the whole picture......... What's the weakest link?
The clamp itself. It's a thin guage piece of metal bent to fit under the 
lip of your rain gutter. I've personally used allen head bolts instead 
of wing bolts thinking I was smart only to have someone show me what a 
screw driver placed under the clamp will do. Leverage pops those clamps 
right off!!

Chains and cables eem like a good idea, but thet're not.........

Mr. VW Smartguy was at Pomona one time with a *CHERRY* OG westy rack on 
his Bus. He took it to the car corral Saturday and left it overnight. 
All of us were telling him, &quot;take the rack off&quot; But no, he says he has 
it handled. Out comes a big cable and lock that he proceeds to wrap in 
an out of the rack, etc. then under his Bus.

Cool, I guess..................

Until we roll in Sunday morning, and guess what, no rack!!!
There was a nice (cut) cable and lock there though.

Mr. Thief probably bought a bolt cutter from one of the vendors for $10


The *only* way to keep the rack on your car is to weld it on.

Just my 2 cents, and the reason my racks stay in my shop unless I'm 
using them.
