I received this from Chris Huff this evening.  I thought I would pass it on
to everybody. The hubcap now has gone international !!!!!

Subject: Auburnn Hills and the Tao of the Tour


Dear Folks,

Sorry to be so long in updating everyone about the Auburn Hills Show but I
didn't want to bombard everyone with double doses of trip reports (also
posted to the Vintage Bus and Type 2 lists).

Jamie Rivers of Cambridge, Ontario, Canada has the Tour Box and Hubcap now.
The plan is to celebrate the Tour there in Canada for a while and then move
the Hubcap back to Detroit and from there to Kevin Ahlgrim in LaPorte,
Indiana and then on to Chicago and points north and west for a while then
head south again to our brethren in Alabama and Mississippi then on to
Texas!

The Show itself was a lot of fun. We got to meet many Type 2  and Vintage
Bus listees and Tour Drivers there and had a chance to see some really
beautiful VW busses and bugs. The pass in review was great and the museum
was open to everyone there. Volkswagen really tried to make everyone feel
welcome and thanks to Jamie Rivers we are going to be written up in
Volkswagen's newsletter and a word or two was dropped in the museum
curator's ear about the Tour memorabilia. We shall see what happens from
there.

A photographer from the Detroit Free Press showed up to take pictures of the
hubcap and I got an e-mail from Sally Farhat of the &quot;Freep&quot; when I got back
saying that she wanted to write up a piece for the Monday paper. I missed
her e-mail while I was gone so I don't know if the article appeared or not.
I did check the on-line copy of the paper and found nothing so that may not
have panned out. I know that we don't particularly care about publicity, but
it will help &quot;the cause&quot; when the Tour winds down and it's time to find a
place for the Hubcap and Tour Souvenirs

Speaking of the Souvenirs, they are great!!! There is more fun stuff in the
Tour Box and at the suggestion of several Tour Drivers and Friends, I went
out and got a bigger box (photos of which are on the web page at
http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff). I don't know how that will work out as a
practical matter, and it won't hurt my feelings if we have to sideline it,
but we might give it a try and see what happens (seems like the whole modus
operandi of the Tour). I can't wait for you guys farther down the line to
see this stuff! For you guys who have already driven, I will post the
catalogue and photos I have of the goodies on the web page soon.

As far as I can tell, the only thing that seems to be missing from the box
was the purple stuffed bird. Whoever has that, please let me know and I'll
arrange with you to forward it to the Venerable Keepers of the Tour Box
Memorabilia so we can keep our stuff together. If you notice anything else
that is missing, please let me know and we'll try to track it down.

For you guys who get the Tour Box in the future, I will be asking you to
make photocopies of the log book pages so we can post those on the web page
and for you to send along a list of stuff you put in the box so those who
have driven before will have the fun of knowing about those too.

I have photocopies of the log book up to Sunday May 21st (courtesy of the
really nice folks at the Marriott) and will be posting either scanned copies
of those or typewritten copies to the web page too. Some of the drawings are
really cute and should be enjoyed by everyone so I'll get on that as soon as
I can. I also have a copy of Charlie Ford's extremely moving story of how he
came to have &quot;The Mothership&quot;. I don't have Charlie's current e-mail address
so if any of you have it and wouldn't mind forwarding it to me, I'd like to
write him for permission to re-print it on the web page.

I can't thank Steve Dolan and John Hartranft enough for their role in
getting the Tour moving again. Steve drove all the way from Alexandria to
Detroit just to bring us the Hubcap and Tour box. He left at eleven o'clock
on the day of the show to drive back to Virginia so he could go back to work
the next day so if there's ever to be a &quot;Loyal Order of the Great Bus Tour&quot;
he should be given the first medal.

John really knocked himself out helping to arrange for the Tour booth and in
actually setting it up and running it throughout the Show. He didn't get to
hang on to the box for very long but he sure put out the effort to make this
thing work and will probably be instrumental in moving the tour back into
the States.

I want to take the time to thank all of you for your continued interest and
support. It seems like such a silly thing to do on the surface, but this
Tour has done more to bring VW lovers together than any one thing short of
the Vintage Bus and Type 2 lists themselves. And it's been great FUN! I mean
how often do we get to act totally goofy without having to explain
ourselves?

Whew! This is a long newsletter! If you get sick of all this and want me to
take you off this list I will do so if you will hit the return response
button on your e-mail program and type &quot;Take Me Off This List&quot; in the
subject line.

I will update you on Jamie's leg of the trip when he let's me know what
happened and what is planned next!
