Luckily, I was able to find the part number for the switch I used to make my 
6V wipers 3 speed in my 12V camper.  It's NAPA number HC6332.  Be sure to 
install it on the wiper side of the switch, because it does have a small bulb 
in the switch which could run down the battery if installed on the hot side.

Good luck, and let me know of any problems.
