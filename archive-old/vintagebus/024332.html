After searching for such information,
I ran across Car Care Specialties
many months ago.
They finally have a good website.
http://www_dot_carcareonline_dot_com/

They don't just promote one product,
but explain the differences between
various ones, and under what conditions
one is better than another.

Overall these people do what I consider
a very good job.  I was thinking about
doing something along these lines, but
he's doing a great job.  Spend some time
checking out the recommendations. You
can get some of the products locally,
but usually at a higher price.

They cover vinyl, tires, rubber, paint,
car covers, and a whole lot more.
Why one should not use silicone is covered.

The product you were referred to is called
303, and is a decent product, but there
are better ones.  I have some and it seems
to work, so I'll use it on the S*b*r* but
not on my bus or the Q*e*t.  You have to
try several FLAPS to find this stuff or
the other recommended ones.  Different
places stock different stuff.

&gt; Hello again,
&gt; I am writing regarding my front rubber matt on my '65 kombi. I am 
&gt; trying to find the right cleaners/chemicals for it to keep it from 
&gt; drying out and cracking. I have heard that armor-all is bad because 
&gt; it contains silicone, but I am not sure what doesn't contain silicone. 
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also interested in stories regarding products to use oin the 
&gt; vinyl seats, as my rear seats have the original vinyl, which is 
&gt; generally in great shpae and I would like to keep it that way.
&gt; 
&gt; The previous owner recommended a product called &quot;323&quot; I think, but 
&gt; i have been unable to locate that.
