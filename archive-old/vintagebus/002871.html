&gt; Does anyone know off hand if the rear seats from  a 68-71 (or even newer
for
&gt; that matter) bay window bus will fit into the rear passenger area of my 67
&gt; bus. I suppose I could measure myself but I wanted to see if anyone on the
&gt; list has ever had success with trying this. Seats seem to be getting
pretty
&gt; scarce!

Yes they will but......
1) They are 2&quot; shorter in length. You will need to make 2 new, longer
brackets for mounting the seat back to the side wall.
2) The seat bottom comes in 2 styles: on one, the middle leg is identical to
the outer 2. This seat bottom will not fit. The middle leg sits where the
heater tube is.
On the other, the middle leg sits back farther than the outer 2. This bottom
will fit with no problem.
The seat holddowns line up perfectly.
