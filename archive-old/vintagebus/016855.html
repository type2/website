Subject: RGBox Seal/Another one on the road

In regards to the RGB stub axle seal...

****Was written about RGB seals*****
Ronnie set me up with kits w/seals and a DIFFERENT
seal that he said 
was the
proper one,he said save the seal from the kit for a
bug.I have had no
problems with them on the 59(2500 miles) with a small
nut gearbox.The 
seal I
used looked wider than the seals in the kit.

***And was written********
From: Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I'm having a chronic leakage problem - does that
mean I'm not seated?
&gt; Is there something fundamentally different with the
Mexian seals available now? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
About a month ago while on a three week road trip, I
had to make another emergency pit stop at Ronnie's
shop in Lake Havasu City, this time for a leaking
RGB/axle seal leak. Ronnie helped me change the seal
in about an hours time and to this day it is still
sealing just fine. I remember him telling me about a
'special' seal that he uses?? I would recommend
calling him for info on what he is using.
And by the way, thank a million Ronnie again for your
help.

And BTW.. I just got another Bus back on the road
today!! A 66 Kombi that sat for 15 years in a
backyard.
