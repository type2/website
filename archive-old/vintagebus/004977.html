&gt; Theatrical lighting &quot;gels&quot;.  Basically sheets of colored plastic that
&gt; don't mind sitting pretty close to a 500W light bulb.  They come in
&gt; lots and lots of shades, but I don't know which ones are right for a
&gt; Bus.  I bought about three sheets a few years ago for something else
&gt; and they were about $5 apiece for about 2 square feet (0.36 m**2).
&gt; Check at theatrical supply stores in the nearest big city, or maybe go
&gt; over to your college theater department and bum some

I found some at a local art supply store.
