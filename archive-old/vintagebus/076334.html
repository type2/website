Subject: Re: [VB] Re: help id sc gate part numbers

the latches changed in 67 from the 90 degree bend in the end where you grab
it to a curved end. I was told once that was a 67 only latch but holding
them side by side they looked the same as the latches on my 68 single cab
did to me.

&gt; A friend has a tri- star (4 WD Vanagon DC w/ extras) He bought extra gates
for it from a Canadian dealership.  Another friend she has a double bubble
truck.  are the bay truck latches the same as the splitty ones?  I have no
idea.
