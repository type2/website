Subject: Re: Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

John Baker asked:
&gt;Will someone please explain to me why they think that
&gt;it was the hippies who started cutting out fenders?!?!
&gt;

its the unfortunate, GROSSLY exagerated stereotype that sweeps thru this 
list towards any bus owner that may have had long hair or been to a Dead 
show... im surprised our moderator hasnt thrown a gas can on the fire yet, 
he loves &quot;hippies&quot; :-)
