&gt; An oil leak developed at the oil pump cover. I

&gt; will need to replace it tomorrow.

hm, I have a leak there too from my new motor.  not too bad though.

The generator light is on. The voltmeter
&gt; is showing that it is not charging either. I'll have to think about this one
&gt; a little more to figure out how to trouble shoot it.

did you polarise  the generator?

everything hooked up properly?

brushes in good shape?
