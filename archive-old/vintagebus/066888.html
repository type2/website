&gt;as per list reccommendations i have been to the local radio shack and not
&gt;only did they have the 8amp fuse, but they had a fast acting and a slow
&gt;blow version of the fuse.

You want the fast-acting fuse.  You're correct about why slow-blow fuses
exist - they get used with loads like motors or perhaps really, really
huge capacitors (bigger than any you're dealing with here) that draw
big spikes of current for a short time in normal operation.  In your case
you're trying to protect the transistors in the inverter.  The inverter
probably shouldn't draw any huge spikes of current in normal operation,
so you need the fast-acting fuse.

&gt;I also picked up a 470 microfarad capacitor to try to repair the second
&gt;inverter i have. this one does not have an arrow on it, so i guess it is
&gt;non-polarized, so I could hook it up either way, right?

There are such things as non-polarized capacitors.  Does the package
that your cap came in say &quot;non-polarized&quot; on it?  If it does, then hook
it up either way, but if it doesn't, then it should be polarized.
Sometimes there will be what looks like a row of dashes near one lead,
which are really negative signs.  Occasionally, there will be a + near
the positive lead instead.

&gt;as matt suggested-for $4.99 [so you were off by 99 cents matt ;)]

I was using an old Rat Shock catalog.

&gt;i was a little confused about your instructions for hooking this up matt.
&gt;you suggest &quot;Connect the positive lead to the wire between the inverter
&gt;and the radio and the negative lead to ground.&quot; that sounds like three
&gt;wires would need to come out of the capacitor.

Ah.  This may make more sense:

Connect the positive lead to (the wire between the inverter and the radio)
and the negative lead to ground.

Picture:

__________                                               __________
         |                                               |
Inverter |-----positive wire-----*-----positive wire-----| Radio
_________|                       |                       |_________
                                 |
                             capacitor +
                             capacitor -
                                 |
                                 |
                              ground

Like I said before, this probably won't _cure_ the problem, but may allow
you to run the radio a little longer or a little louder without it cutting
out.
