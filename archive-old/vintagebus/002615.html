Hi Everyone,

&gt;First off, this E-mail list is a VERY appropriate forum for discussing
&gt;these matters, in fact ANY matters concerning pre-1968 Transporters
&gt;and anything to do with them.

    I totally agree with Bill here. If someone needs a good bashing, so be
it. I wouldn't want to hear about it every day for a year, but I like to
know problems other people have. Maybe some of us can save time and/or money
let alone hassel.

&gt;After Jeff passed the torch to Steve Nye and eventually on to Dave,
&gt;SOTO seemed to evolve more and more into a Club in which you
&gt;would benifit most if you were Southwest based, more to the point,
&gt;California based.  Nothing really wrong with that, but long distance
&gt;members depended almost solely on their only link, the newsletter,
&gt;which became fairly eratic.  Out of frustration, a group of SOTO
&gt;members in the Boston area a long, long time ago split off with a
&gt;different idea and formed NEATO (NorthEast Association of
&gt;Transporter Owners).

    Being from the midwest I don't know anything about SOTO. I've never got
the joke about the illusive and prized SOTO Newsletter. Now thanks to this
list it is a lot clearer. Hell I didn't know that NEATO arose because of a
poorly run SOTO.


&gt;Now I didn't write all this just to be singing the praises of NEATO vs.
&gt;SOTO

    I will, if you're not in NEATO, you should be. Check NEATO out. I think
you will be very satisfied with the club. As Bill pointed out, no one person
does everything. Regular elections keep the club fresh. If there isn't a
Chapter near you, start one, it's easy.
    No club is perfect, I'll admit that. I am in about a dozen different
clubs here and there. Not all are VW related. I think NEATO is the best one
of them all. Not because it is a Split Bus club. But because of the people
that comprise it. The newsletters are great. Are you looking for a hard to
find part? Put an add in &quot;The Old Bus Review&quot;, it's free to members. Do you
have a good story to write? Send it in to the newsletter. I know must of us
like to write short stories. I see it here on this list all the time.

&gt;  Tightly linked with LiMBO, these
&gt;two Clubs even created their own &quot;Tourist and Transporter Directory&quot;
&gt;as a tremendous benefit of membership to assist it's members while
&gt;out on the road.

  The TTL as it is called by NEATO and LiMBO members is invaluable. To me it
is worth the price of membership alone. It can get you help, parts, or even
a place to stay from other people just like you, Bus people.

  If you want more info on how to join NEATO you can p-mail me. There are
quite a few NEATO members on the list. Some of which do hold office. I don't
recall ever seeing anything bad said about NEATO. So what do you want to do,
join a club like SOTO and look in your X-Mas stocking every year for a
newsletter or join NEATO.
