Subject: generator pulley

Hello guys and gals,
I've been helping a fellow listee pull the engine on his bus and replace
the generator.  We have the engine out, and the generator out...the
backing plate and fan switched over...but there is just one thing we're
hung up on.  How do we get the old pulley half off of the old
generator??  The outer half of the pulley comes off no problem...like if
you were changing a fan belt....but the other half of the pulley is
another story.  We tried a BFH...prying a little...and all to no avail.
It doesn't seem like its bolted on anywhere...but just pressed on.  Is
it just crusted to the generator??

Thanks!
Isaiah
