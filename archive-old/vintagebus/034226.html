i just traded a 1835 for a PORSCHE 356 B engine that i'm going to put in my
1966 hardtop walkthrough delux, can't wait to cruise at 4 g's rpm, and to
top it off all the external parts of the engine are chrome and it runs like
a top, beats putting in the SUPER 90 engine (fresh) that i was thinking of
putting in!

ps. po made a cool mount to use stock VW cable and i'll make the rest of the
tin to seal off engine compartment, no doghouse for me, never needed it in
one of my porsche's.

 Okrasa in a bus


OK, tell me that I'm stupid....

I'm starting to look at what engine transaxle to put into my '59 and I found
a top end Okrasa kit containing the heads and carbs....  Would the carbs fit
in a '59?  I have talked to several people about putting a Judson in a bus
and was told there wasn't enough height so I question the carbs on this kit.
Also, anybody have any experience with Okrasa stuff?  Is waaayyyy over
priced these days?

Thanks

David
