Hello Fellow Bus Fans!

Saturday, we had our first local bus meet in Greenville, SC. The info
was put out by word of mouth and via the lists. We had around 15 buses
show up. I was very pleased! About half the folks were people I've met,
the rest were new friends!

Our next meet is the second Saturday of February, at the same place. I'm
thinking (if it is not too cold) to also have a local camp-in that
weekend at Paris Mtn. State Park...

re: Flower Power: I don't mind if the value of buses go up... I've got
mine, and it is the kewlest ride in town... Those that want one, eat
your hearts out!

david
