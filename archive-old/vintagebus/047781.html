I had a screw into the body break off when I changed the decklid recently
(think it had been there a while?), and I started small with a drill bit and
moved up the the next size, next size (slight differences) very carefully as I
did not want to thrash the threads in the bus, got the old broken piece out
successfully and put it all back together with....GREASING.... the screws for
a easier time next time.  But this is for a broken off screw- yours spins and
does not come out?   There is probably (I have not seen it) a captive nut in
there that broke loose on yours.   hm....pita.   You could drill out the head
of the screw, take the decklid off, and look farther into it, or...?
