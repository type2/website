Subject: Re: [VB] Carbs again....

Have you checked for vapor lock? The symptoms are
similar. Do you run a metal tube for fuel that runs &quot;
too&quot;close to the engine?

&gt; 112.5 main 60 pilot, also with 65 pilot.
&gt; Symptom.
&gt; 	Engine cranks and cranks when warm. Timing static
&gt; on the 009
&gt; around 11.5, dynamically timed to 32.
&gt; 	Engine finally gets going (with gas pedal help
&gt; usually) runs
&gt; rich stumbling angrily for a bit, then idle returns
&gt; to fine.
&gt; 	If cold, good, if sits for a while to cool, then
&gt; good, 10-25
&gt; minutes after run, bad.
&gt; Since mixture seems good, and runs nicely, where the
&gt; heck do I look for
&gt; this problem? I thought a dirty pilot, but not that.
&gt; Then I figured fuel
&gt; pressure problem, but wouldn't it run badly all the
&gt; time?
&gt; If the float was stuck and not kicking the fuel shut
&gt; off, wouldn't I
&gt; have a mess?
&gt; 
&gt; Al, still wondering about solexes...
