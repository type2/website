Subject: Bogus electrical short?

Hello list,
  I was wondering if anyone could shorten my tracking down time.  Here
goes:   My ignition coil slipped from it's bracket and started
shorting(sparking) with my intake manifold while the engine was on.  The
positive  lead wire to the coil slipped off and the engine stopped. 
While I was seeing all this going on (I was back looking in the
compartment by now) I noticed electrical smoke in the cab but do not
know exactly where from.  Now, I got everything back together but my
horn, wipers, and turn signals do not work!  All of my fuses are good. 
I did however notice that most of my fuses were too high an amperage.  I
have practically all 30amp's! Stupid.  But does anyone have any
suggestions on were to focus?  Everything else works except those three
things.  Help? 
 Thanks,  J.D.
