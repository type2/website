Wonder if it was an airport bus- you know to move the luggage to the plane 
And back?  Saw a double slider 21 window in yellow with limited slip 
differential and mountain gears (lots on that M code tag)  that had been 
ordered as an airport luggage bus.   Guess they wanted the sunroof so they 
could toss the bags in from above.
