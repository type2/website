Since my deal on a 65 went down the drain and I have to probably move soon
I've got a few things that I want to offer here to someone that can put them
to good use.
For grabs are:
1600 DP OG engine case (73 bug case) (good condition?)
Sekurit pop-out glass (I think it's 4 or 5 pieces)
Split window gas tank
6V starter (rebuilt)
doghouse style cooler
generator with fan

all for $20.00
come and pick it up.

I'm located in the Chicagoland area.

Andre
