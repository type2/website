&lt;&lt; ok....what gauges do most of you run on your buses?&gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
We run oil pressure, oil temp and voltage gauge.  We tach out our trannies 
for only fifteen minutes to write down where 1,500 &amp; 3,000 RPMs are in each 
forward gear.  Will soon be installing new VDO head temp gauges we have 
picked up for almost nothing at the swaps to see how they do.

&lt;&lt; why would an oil pressure gauge be better to start out with?&gt;&gt;
If one can not afford to get both oil pressure and temp gauges the pressure 
gauge shows more of what is happening in the engine.  When oil gets hotter 
the pressure it can be pumped up to drops off so the lower the pressure at 
the same RPM/MPH/Gear, the higher the temp.  On the other hand if the oil 
pressure drops this will not be shown by an oil temp gauge until after the 
engine is toast.

&lt;&lt; I just did a search on the web for oil temp gauges, and found a bunch of 
companies selling them. I have sent email to all re:obtaining a 6v version of 
their gauges.&gt;&gt;
Please keep us all informed on what you find out! 

&lt;&gt;
In electronics almost anything is possible!  It just depends on how much you 
want to spend!

&lt;&lt;Has anyone ever done business with this company, or know the reliability of 
their products?&gt;&gt;
We have never heard of them!  Will be interesting to see/hear about thier 
products.

&lt;&lt; What is the range that i should eb looking for with any gauges ie:   oil 
temp -180 deg  to 300 deg?  &gt;&gt;
That would be the minimum.  Would be better to be able to measure at least 
150-250F.   

&lt;&lt;one more question about gauges, what about digital vs. analog?&gt;&gt;
We prefer analog.  Digtal read out when the pressure/temp fluctuates can 
become a sudden blurr of numbers.  The needle of analog is alot easier to see 
it's position at a glance and if fluctuating suddenly up or down is also easy 
to figure which way it is going!   Eric&amp;Barb
