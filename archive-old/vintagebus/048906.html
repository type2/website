I am new to this list as of today.  I am looking to buy a bus in good condition in the Southeast.  I live in North Alabama, and I never see buses for sale.  If anyone knows where I could find a good bus, please let me know.  I don't want a basket case, I need a good straight daily driver, that is ready to be restored.

Thanks,

Bryan
