Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] VOA strikes again

Boy, I'd love to see how 'PM' could be made into a VW logo.

I work at a VW Dealer that also has Lincoln/Mercury.  I feel sorry for
those of you who have never tried to buy parts for cars much newer than
our old buses.  I got yelled (yes, actually yelled) at last week by some
irritated old lady because a sunvisor for her 93 Villager is NLA ('Not
Replaced' is the Ford term).  Just 3 weeks before, I received my new
sunvisor for my 86 vanagon syncro.

Don't even get me started on Merkurs and Scorpios!!

VW is just like every other car maker out there.  They all supply parts
where the volume is - NEW.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hopefully for awhile that will satisfy their need to harass people trying
&gt; to keep alive the very vehicles that they show virtually no support for.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Kelly, you know, I think Volkswagen is just wasting their time chasing
&gt; all the small-time users of their name.  The truth is that the Volkswagen
&gt; name is out of date, what with its 1930's lumpenproletariat overtones.  VW
&gt; would do much better just to let everyone use their present trademarks and
&gt; pick a new name, more in touch with their present corporate identity, and
&gt; which no one else would want to use.
&gt; 
&gt; How about, say, Philip Morris?  Its present owner doesn't want the name
&gt; anymore, it has built-in brand recognition, and nobody else will want to use
&gt; it.  And best of all, it fits their new corporate style.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Grant
