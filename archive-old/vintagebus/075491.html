Subject: Re: m-codes/middle seats

&gt;From: &quot;ronnie chase&quot; &lt;ronniechase_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if m-427 might be the walk through fronts with a full
&gt;width middle seat. anyone know?

Most of the M-code lists around crap out around 300 and pick up again
in the 500s.  The consensus seems to be that many of the 300 and 400
series M-codes mean required equipment for a particular country.  For
example, 303 is Italy, 396 is England, 430 is US (including dual circuit
brakes).  My '64 (built November '63) has M 426 which doesn't show up in
any of the lists I have found.  Roughly, earlier Buses tend to have
separate M codes for each piece of different equipment and later Buses
tend to have a 300 or 400 series M-code according to original destination
country.

You can research M-codes a bit at the VintageBus Registry:
http://vintagebus_dot_com/registry/  Put the M-code number in one of the
&quot;search&quot; boxes and hit the &quot;list format&quot; button for all the details,
or hit the &quot;stats format&quot; button to get some summary tables of all
the Buses in the Registry that have that code.

&gt;Also wondering about the possibility of a aug. 63 built bus coming with
&gt;a 62-63 style middle seat. still has 15's and pull handle front doors.

My Bus came with MX-140 (aka MX-265) * so I can't say for sure.  Doliwa
says:

12 Dec 1963  1 178 188  Seats and seat-backs:  Front seat bank support
                        rod changed.  Seat and backrest (purchases
                        seamed/lined with pleats.)  Upholstery welded
                        together; was sewn.

The second sentence in German is: &quot;Sitz- und Rueckenlehnenbezuege mit
Biesen gesaeumt.&quot;  At any rate, it appears that the seat upholstery
changed in December, so your Bus might have the &quot;62-63 style&quot; seat.
