Subject: Re: [VB] In need of full length split bus roof rack 10'

&lt;&lt;  do have a 6' bay unit for trade if needed or will sell later when I find 
a 
 10' rack.
 
 The only &quot;new&quot; option I have seen is Tom Conner's racks but they seem a bit 
 pricey and shipping to the east coast sounds miserable.
 
 Thanks,
 Adrian Pillow &gt;&gt;

You could get a 4' rack and have two racks on the bus. 

Tom makes nice roof racks.  almost as far from you as a person could get and 
still be in the continental US. though
