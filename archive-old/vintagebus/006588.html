Call Olympic powder coatings in Santa Ana, Cali. they are probaly one of the
best in the country, if you have powder coated faucets or shower doors they
probaly did them, along with tons of VW, Porsche and bicycle parts, I have
been useing them for over 15 years and have never had a complaint.

Does anyone on the list have any experience/recommendations for getting
powder coating done near Palmdale, CA or northern LA. I would like to get my
wheels and bumpers done for my 59 deluxe. I am looking for a place that can
duplicate the correct white.

Thanks, 
Paul
