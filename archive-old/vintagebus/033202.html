Is the shifter in the front at the floor the forward (tunnel) style or the 
rear (split-case) style?

&lt;&lt;Hi All,


A few days ago I posted a question regarding my vin and engine type for my

'59 double cab and got a response from Clara:


She said

&quot;thanks for including your VIN, as it was a mid year change.   The &quot;modified

36hp&quot; motor aka bastard 40hp was introduced at CH # 469 447 on May 19 1959.

There also changed at this point to the tunnel case tranny from the split

case tranny.  So, yours is one of the very first post 36hp buses.   In the

36hp buses it is a bit tricky installing a motor with the later heater boxes

as they tend to hang up.&quot;


Well, I just went and checked and I found the following:


- VIN 469869 (all three tags match i.e. the screw on one in the engine

compartment, the stamped one by the engine and the one behind the seat)

- Engine number 3047914 (with cast generator stand... so it's a 36 hp

right?)

- Also it appears to be a split case transmission (i.e. there are bolts

holding the two halves together).


BTW, the tag behind the seat reads 361, UP 265 BLUE (Dove Blue I presume)


So gurus.... what's the deal?


Thanks


David&gt;&gt;
