&gt; check this camper out.

Now,

this is humorous...

This camper was for sale at $10-11k.  The web page contained detailed
pictures of its conversion from a &quot;walk through&quot; to a &quot;hack through&quot;

I wont go into details, but i had some P-mail conversations with the owner
in which he assured me that this modification added value, and i took the
contrary point.

Now, it is on e-bay and this &quot;value adding&quot; modification has been glossed
over, though it is at least visible in one picture, though just barely.

caveat emptor,

Steve

p.s. to be fair, i have no idea who is auctioning it off, or if its even
the same owner.
