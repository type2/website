Subject: Re: [VB] Most important of all, . . . these days

&gt; We have recurring threads, tires, rims, dizzys, lights, carbs/jets,
&gt; etc.  But here's a thread I've not seen on the list in the three years
&gt; I've been on:  mpg, or to our friends across the Atlantic and Pacific
&gt; ponds:  kpl.

In Europe we don't use kpl (lilometer per liter, but liter / 100 km).
I do not know about Canada. It feels awkward switching from one unit
to the other but one gets used to it. I know the following

10mpg (H2) : 23.6 l/100
20mpg (bus) : 11.7 l/100
30mpg (golf) : 7.8 l/100
50mpg (kawasaki ninja) : 4.7 l/100
x mpg -&gt; 3.78/(x*1.61) l/100

In the list, there is one vehicle that I do not own, guess which one
it is... I find that people are more concerned about fuel economy in
Europe than in the US, likely because fuel is more expensive there,
maybe it's also a cultural thing.
