&gt; Yeah, but did they make a sign and a speech and put flowers on you?
&gt; Were there hundreds of people standing around the end of the production

Nope, just lubed, adjusted my knobs, filled my tank, denoted too much weight in
the back end, checked the valves, noticed occassional exhaust leak and kicked
me back out on the street. Members of the OG production line are taking dirt
nap but still have fans all over the world.  Parts are getting harder to find
and seem to be &quot;one of a kind&quot;. =)

Thanks to everybody for the completely unsolicited birthday greetings. Subject
thread over- but Tom Brioulette's birthday is today.
