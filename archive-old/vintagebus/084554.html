Subject: Re: [VB] Wrong Muffler?

 Sounds like you have a 40hp bus muffler.   There are lots of these around NOS, which is nice if you are running a 40hp in your bus.  But it sucks if you buy one thinking it is for your 1600 and it is too narrow.  I have picked those up for $10-$20 at swaps for when I run a 40hp in a bus.  A fresh air 40hp muffler looks amazingly like a 1600 muffler.  A 36hp one is quite different looking.   If the muffler is like a cylinder, please let me know, I'd love to buy it from you.
 
The 40hp is narrower than the 1600.   So the muffler is narrower.    Also the rear tin is narrower.   
Sometimes you find a muffler is maybe 1/8 inch too wde or narrow, as heads can be different amounts apart depending on how much the heads have been flycut and/or how much the cylinders ae shimmed out.   But an inch or two sounds like the 40hp muffler is the culprit.

So I bought a &quot;new but dinged up&quot; bus muffler from a VW shop about a year 
ago for the 1600SP I'm rebuilding.  In attempting to fit the muffler to 
the heads, it seems about an inch or two too narrow (i.e. with one flange 
on one head, the other muffler flange would need to stretch an additional 
1-2&quot; to fit on the other head).

The muffler is a stock muffler - or at least an Ernst or whatever.

I know that these mufflers sometimes need a little cajoling and prying to 
fit properly, but it seems like just a bit too far to be &quot;right&quot;.  Is it 
possible that I have an older style muffler - like a 36 or 40 HP muffler?  
Would a 36/40 HP muffler look different than a 1600SP muffler (i.e. 
more of a round shape, or something) or would it be different at all?
