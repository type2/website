I've done it before, but because I got a good front beam from a '68 for
free.  We had to cut out and turn the center section to lower it, and then
it was a guess as how much to turn.  I probably wouldn't do it again because
I probably won't get another '68 beam for free again, and the gain wasn't
really that great in comparison.  I'd put my money in rebuilding the
original beam.

One man's opinion.
