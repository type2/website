Subject: [VB] Engine Main Seal/Clutch Replacement Tips?

Hi Guys,

My clutch has been slipping on occasion and the TOB used to chirp quite
badly...funny thing is, now that I ordered the replacement parts, the single
cab has been running 100%, no chirping-no slippage? Weird, but I believe I
should replace the clutch and main seal before I have more problems.
I ordered a 180mm clutch kit and engine main seal. My engine is a 1600cc 6
volt electrical, so I hope the 180mm is correct? Anyways, I have never
replaced either of these parts before and I am looking for some tips to help
make the job a success.  Thanks for your advise :-)

-Tom
