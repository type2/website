&gt; Thanks for all the replies.
&gt; 
&gt; Update: The engine is out of the 71 and I saw that the front seal was
&gt; leaking. Off with the flywheel to replace but could not see any evidence of
&gt; an &quot;o&quot; ring, or the gasket between the crank and flywheel. I put it back
&gt; together with a new front seal and no gasket the same way it came apart. Did
&gt; I mess up?

The O-ring is there.  It's often a silver color that makes it hard to see
against the steel of the flywheel.  Use a sharp pin to feel around the
outer circumference of the surface against which the crank seats.
 
&gt; The end play the way I did it was .005&quot;. This is without the gasket and only
&gt; the two shims that were there.

Close to the wear limit, but within specs.
 
&gt; Also, I torqued to 240 per Muir, but read 253 in Bentley tonight. Is that a
&gt; big deal?

5% isn't a big deal.  You'll get a chance to retorque it when you look for
the O-ring again :)
