Hi, Volks!

I would like to sell my 1967 Bus and don’t have a good idea how much to
ask for it. If anyone can give me a rough idea what it’s worth from my
description here, I’d be delighted, and offers are of course welcome.

It’s a white 15-window (2 louvered, 2 popout) 12 volt model , in pretty
good running condition, 220,000 miles on it. Key number is 30L009 for you
sleuths.

The good news:
The engine and transmission both have less than 1000 miles since a
rebuild. They were both built by my mechanic of 10 years who is very
careful and competent.
It got a new carburetor and fuel pump with the rebuild, and also had an
auxiliary oil filter added.
The tires have less than 1000 miles on them.
The battery is 2 months old.
The paint is original, and it has never had any body work done.
It has been in my family since 1968, and has been driven gently and
treated well. We have lived in California or Arizona the whole time
except for 2 years in Iowa.

The bad news:
It’s been sitting for about 5 years since the rebuild, just driven around
the block once in a while. (gas in tank is useable)

The following are missing from it:
Wing window handle (right side)
Sliding window handle (driver’s door)
Exterior handle, side door
VW emblem on front
Most of the interior panels
2 hubcaps
Spare rim+tire
Both front seats (and the original mount for the driver’s seat has been
cut out, so you would not be able to just get another seat and stick it
in)
The first piece of sheet metal inside the engine compartment that you
would remove if you were about to take out the engine.

Other problems:
The gas gauge isn’t working, probably a bad sending unit.
The turn signal lever assembly is a little loose.
It won’t signal a right turn. Turn signal relay? Loose connection? I
don’t know.
 Brakes may be weak.
There are a few very minor dents in the front, and the engine compartment
door has a moderate dent/bend.
The rain gutter has a few bent places.
There are a lot of little rust spots (none deep)

Breaks my heart, but I have to sell. Thanks for your help.
