Subject: FS: T3 oil cooler 

Hi everyone,

I bought a used T3 oil cooler a while back that it looks like I will not 
need anymore.  So I offer it up to the list so someone else can use it in a 
bus.  See Ronnie's posts on how he really likes this cooler mod.  Apparently 
it has 33% more surface area than the normal doghouse cooler.

I figure it might be good for a 5-10 degree temp drop.  But that is subject 
to debate for more or less.

The only install notes are that the oil pressure sender bung must be plugged 
somehow.  Probably can get an Aeroquip AL plug for it.

$20 + shipping takes it home (I am not making squat on this so I cannot go 
lower).  Willing to trade for &quot;go fast&quot; parts (need some Berg stuff), or 
Jalousie window screens.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
