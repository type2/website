&gt; Anyone remember a fellow by the name of Todd Hill from a couple of years

&gt; several folks on tranny rebuild deals and some never got there trannys back
&gt; from him at all and he moved off to Ohio or something! What ever happened to
&gt; him anyway? Be careful out there. I finally had Volkswerks Transaxle in CA
&gt; build a freeway flyer for me. Pricey but no more tranny troubles.

At least you got your transmission back!  Some didn't.

I am currently running a Todd Hill &quot;rebuilt&quot; in my '71.  It has actually
lasted several years.  When I sent it to him it was popping out of 4th.
It no longer popped out of fourth, but it started dropping out of second
on deceleration.  I suppose that this is an improvment, but not worth the
$600 I paid.

Live and learn...
