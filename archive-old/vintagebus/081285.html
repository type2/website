Subject: Re: [T2] VW Boat

I picked one of these up about 7 or 8 years ago from a guy in central
Oregon, Paid $400 for the thing wich included oars and life vests. I used it
for two seasons with my wife and then one night in LA, it was stolen :-(
I would pay $1,000 for one like it if I could find one today.
