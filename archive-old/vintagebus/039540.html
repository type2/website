Hey Thom,
   The other hedberg is my Dad, he's the one that turned me on to the list 
in the first place, he was always telling me about all these &quot;cool dudes on 
the list&quot;, so I thought I would give it a try! Its really nice to have two 
old busses in the house and I can't wait till we can both caravan to shows 
and show off our busses (mine is a 63' panel, and his is the rarer 62' 15 
win dlx) and I thought I had something to show off! Later

   -Christian
