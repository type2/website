Thom, list, et al,
Having grown up in the mountains on a cattle ranch, 
I remember the neb making his own ropes out of hemp twine with a hand
cranked machine.
later everyone went to plastic rope. 
when we moved to the valley, the minors were pretty cool excepting the
ones who were growing pot.
There was three incidences that I can look to: 1, the dealers open at all
hours to the north of our farm. 
they buzzed me at night while i was out irrigating pasture. 
It wasn't a state helicopter hovering and shinning a search light on me.
These yahoos buzzed me at low altitude and i hit the dirt. 
i guess it must have been fun to scare a local hick like that.
2, that outfit ended with a double murder suicide.
3, the other was a greenhouse setup north of our other farm.
their guard dogs got to roaming with packs and killed some of our calfs.

when I got into busses it wasn't because of  hemp hippie cool.
the old world / utility / work aspect did
(i don't think I'll ever lust after a deluxe)
Aloha

PS
in my stent as a roadie,
I allways got my gate $ cut up front from hippie promoters 
because they liked to blow it on weed with the rastas after the gig
(dern macrobiotic wannabes)
