Find a mechanical advance unit, perhaps a 383 dizzy.  I see VJ 4 BR 8s every
once in a while, I just bought one a while back for my '54, those might only
be suitable for 36 ers, though.  Are you going to run the
no-accelerator-pump carb.?

That VJUR 4 BR 8 is for a 36 hp Bug engine.

I didn't understand your plug wire question, why would you need to cut the
ends off?  Aside from what the reason is, mine unscrew.

bossguitar_at_aol_dot_com response:

I'm not sure what size carb I have.  All it says is Solex on both sides and
has the number 830984 stamped on the back.  And as I said before, it has no
place for the vacuum advance to go.  Everett suggested I get a mechanical
advance 383 dizzy for a distributor.  I'm not sure what a 383 dizzy is though.

The plug wires on a 25hp engine go into the side of the distributor cap and
somehow connect in the inside of the cap top.  I still don't understand if I
need special wires or I should just cut the ends off a 36hp set.
Ideas?
