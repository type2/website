Rhunes29 writes&gt; Northern Cal who really wants to
trade a '60 panel for my bug. I need advice..

Maybe we could get a better idea of what advice to
offer you if we knew what kind of shape YOUR car was
in. I have tried to get you to send a description, and
some pictures for over a month now, no dice. If you
don't have a digital camera, you can take developed
photo's to any Kinko's and have them scanned and
placed on a diskette for a minimal fee. Considering a
trade is hard to do without pics of your car. In all
likelihood, a car that is only missing taillights is
going to be missing, and or hiding a lot. Like that
saying goes...if it sounds to good to be true....it
is.
