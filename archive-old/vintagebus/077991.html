Subject: Re: [VB] flames

&gt;&gt; Shouldn't the flames be coming out the back vents in an ACVW????
.....  i offered the thought that the flames
&gt; were from the incredible speed... the friction between nose and air made
&gt; flames.  like re-entry dude.  ;-)

Does that mean that he can't display a 0-60 in 11 minutes sticker on the rat
DC if he has flames on the front?
