I took photos of the rear brake to show what NOT to do on your bus :)  PO...

I also took a picture of the springs and so forth so I know how to
re-assemble.  Does this location and type of spring setup look ok?

This is a 1967 Type2 Westy Camper.

Thanks to all.

Wholly Crap!  I'm glad I got that axle nut off... One of the star screws was
out ALL THE WAY, I mean ready to fall out.   The other was all the way in...
The drum is destroyed from the one shoe being worn down to metal and the
other one looks brand new :)  At least I can get away with replacing only
one shoe :)
