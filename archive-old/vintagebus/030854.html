Subject: re: more copyright

OK.  I'll shut up right now and wipe the egg off my face.  I did not
read far enough down the FAQ.  The previous post, as I'm sure you all
caught was WRONG in the context I placed it in.  I neglected to see the
first line.  It was for works created AFTER '78.  Here is the paragraph
I meant to quote.


&quot;For works published in the years 1904 through 1963, the copyright
lasted
for 28 years from date of publication; if the copyright was not renewed,

it lapsed, and the work went into the public domain.  Another 28 years
of
protection could be obtained by filing a renewal, for a total term of 56

years (1906 comes from the fact that the U.S. effectively switched to a
47 year second term in 1962, and 1962 minus 56 (the old maximum duration

of two 28 year terms) equals 1906).  If the copyright was not renewed
after its initial 28 year term, the work lapsed into public domain.
Generally, all copyrights secured in 1918 or earlier lapsed at the
latest
in 1993 and are now in public domain (1993 (last year) minus 75 equals
1918).  Copyrights secured in the period 1919 through 1949 continue to
exist only if they were renewed, and expire in the period 1994 through
2024.&quot;

So, depending if VW renewed or not,  it is either in the public domain
currently or will fall into the public domain in the year 2010.  Only 9
more years ;-)  Anybody want to call up VW and find out??  ;-)

Steve
