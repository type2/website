What do parents here do for child safety?  Brand names and model names of
booster seats would be helpful.  I need something that will work for a 2
year old child over 40lbs and exclusively with lapbelts.  (He'll probably
be 3 by the time we need to use the new seat.)  My bus is a 66 split
walk-thru.  I do have some belts to install for use with the Z-bed, and
will gladly drill those holes.

while not being able to help you with the child seat dilemma, I believe that
66 buses came with seat belt mounting holes in the back, even if seat belts
have never been installed.  There would be a big white plastic pug with a
phillips head type top you unscrew and then there is the threaded insert thing
to mount the belts to.
