Wow, what a great Idea ..... but .... what if you had the water source on
your roof rack and had a hose that somehow went into the engine compartment
.... where it went into a small radiator like thing that just got warm from
being in the engine compartment - the things with fins on them  ..... maybe
it could be mounted near the battery tray on the side the battery isn't. As
the water warmed in the engine compartment it would re-circulate back up to
the reservoir on the roof rack ..... after a 6 hour trip wow .... would you
have a hot shower ....

Guess I better find an ashtray and put this thing out .....

&gt; i know this subject is a little old, but i'm kind of behind on VB things
(i
&gt; have that other life to live). I came up with a good idea for a camping
&gt; shower setup in a bus that any of you are welcome to steal/borrow/make use
&gt; of. first you open your back hatch. see how it stays open above you? now
&gt; imagine a curtain rod going around the whole hatch with a curtain
attached.
&gt; now imagine a shower spiggot (sp) clamped to the little panel below your
&gt; window with a hose running to it from a water tank located above the
engine.
&gt; see where i'm going with this? pretty neat huh? for a base, you could get
&gt; one of those plasic water heater stands from home depot and drill drain
&gt; holes in the bottom (so you don't have to stand in mud, defeating the
&gt; purpose of taking a shower). and voila! now you have fully imagined a neat
&gt; little shower with a sun window. how you pump the water is really up to
you.
&gt; you could use a hand pump or one of those electrical pumps that are found
on
&gt; later model westy sinks. also, if you have a monza-style exhaust, you can
&gt; use it to hold your soap! (bumpers work too).
