Skid Marx writ:

&gt; Does anyone out there know of someplace other than Stockton Wheel that can
&gt; widen some steel VW wheels?
&gt;
&gt; I was recently quoted $90.00 each from them to widen 2 wheels from 4.5
&gt; inches to 8 inches. That seems a little steep.

From the point of view of someone who owns a metal working business and a
lot of liability insurance, that sounds like a bargain. I wouldn't touch a
set of wheels for 10 times that amount. (Imagine the lawsuit when one wheel
fails)
