Hey all,

Like I said yesterday my bus is kicking some nice heat, however yesterday it 
was smelling a bit like exhaust and making be feel a tad weird (could be 
psyching myself out but don't like to play w/ carbon monoxide).  When I 
hooked up my heater the drivers side had the metal vented tube thing that 
goes from heat exchanger to tube then to bus body.  A fellow list member 
kicked me a long tube to fill the gap from the heat exchanger to bus body 
(no metal vented thing).  I wasn't too worried but notice the exhaust smell 
and that I did have the proper metal thing in my bus bit box.  Is it real 
important that I put that thing on?  Could this be letting exhaust gasses 
into the heat system.  My novice bus logic tells me to retorque the muffler 
(its a cheasy 4 tip monza type) and possibly replace the muffler gaskets.  
Any other ideas.  If I haven't made since so far w/ the above exclamation 
the metal thing is like a moped muffler looking baffle thing that appears to 
disipate heat or something which is tottally nonexistent on the passenger 
side.  I'm also runing a 74 AK 1600 DP.

Thanks,

Eric
