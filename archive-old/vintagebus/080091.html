Subject: re:hard to find first and second

Could be the last time you fiddled with the shifter you didn't replace it in
the exact correct location.

There is a trick to replacing it in the right spot-I think it has something
to do with leaving the two bolts that hold it down loose, putting the bus in
reverse, then tightening...

Then again if that little tab you spoke of is bent-you'll probably always
have trouble. Try finding a new shifter or bending that tab back.
