Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat seatbelts

I have a '66 De Luxe that my parents bought new back then.  The
middle seat definitely didn't come with seatbelts or even mounting
points.  They had the dealer install one seat belt for someone
sitting in the center of the middle seat (that would be for me or my
sister).  They just drilled two holes, for the two mounting bolts,
right through the floor a little behind the middle seat.  And punched
two holes through the rubber mat. (They bought it at Johnson Pacific,
in Oakland, CA.)

Rust has never formed around those two holes.  Rust *has* formed in
the mounting points for the middle seat itself, so now there are
holes through the floor at a couple of those points, too.  The seat
has sat in one garage or another for most of the car's life, and is
now sitting in my garage.  I may have the unused middle seatbelt
stashed in some box or another.  It was an official gray VW
seatbelt (the stock seatbelts in this bus, velvet green / pearl
white, are light gray) with the Wolfsburg Crest on the release handle.
