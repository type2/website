Subject: contest and webpage update

Hi everyone,
   In the spirit of the holidays, I've decided to have a contest to give
away a toy bus. All you have to do is guess how many VW Micro Machines I
have stuffed into a glass Beetle cookie jar and I'll send you a 1/43 Solido
VW Fire Bus. No strings just holiday cheer. The first one to guess exactly
by Dec. 15, 2000 gets it. Pics of the jar and the prize are on my website.
  Also, I have updated my website with some of my new VW toy finds at the
various department stores. Just click on the VW Collectibles Museum section
and then hit the &quot;What's New&quot; link.
  I'm also going to get my own domain name for my website. If you send me a
name and I use it, I'll send you a little something something as well.
  See all of this and more at http://members.socket_dot_net/~rickd

Happy Holidays
