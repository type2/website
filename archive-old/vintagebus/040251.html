That's awesome! Have a good time... I've had the pleasure of meeting and 
trading/dealing with Jeff in the past. He's a pretty neat cat.
Be safe.

Whichever God that you pray to keep my family in mind.
We are off to ensure that my long time VW pal, Jeff
Bettez and his lady get married this weekend. =)

Little did I know that when I agreed to be his &quot;best
man&quot; that we would be flying from Phoenix to Rhode
Island and back amidst current circumstances. When
given the chance to back out I told Jeff that 'Best'
and 'Man' are two key words that I try to stand by.
Good thing he didn't ask me to be &quot;Best Fool&quot;. hahaha

Now on the other hand, if we travel and he decides not
to jump the broom then he will learn the real meaning
of terror. ;-) At that point we'd be supporting Misty,
his fiance' in Operation Eternal Castrating Justice.
Otherwise, we refuse to be terrorized and will
continue to give Mr. and Mrs. Bettez our strongest
support.

Buckle the seat belt and hand me a Valium...
Watch for me on TV.
