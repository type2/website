Subject: wing window rebuild, chrome latch

Has anyone out there ever had to remount the lock tab for wing windows?
Mine need to be rechromed so will have to find a way to remount them.
They are rivited in there, but it is preaty tight on the inside where
the rivit head goes.  I have a fealing that trying to put the tabs back
on after the frame is freshly painted may be a real challenge.

Has anyone done this?
Any tricks out there?
Anyone know a source for the rivits?

Thanks for the help.
Matthew
