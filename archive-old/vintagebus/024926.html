Hi Chris,
  Get some $$ together and buy a Bentley reprint of the 63-67 VW bus shop 
manual so you can do your suspension correctly.  There is plently of good 
info for buses as early as 55 in there.
Best to go with the standard 6 volt wiper motor and a voltage (Resistor) drop 
or two to get the voltage down to 7 volts at most.  Repack the wiper gear box 
filling it only about 1/4 to 1/3 full with lithium grease.  This will make 
the wiper motor quieter, faster, and more powerfull because the old grease in 
there by now is nasty thickened stuff.
  The holes in your doors are for some type of trucker mirror, though for VOA 
or aftermarket accessory.  As for the holes for the antennia there are too 
many.  So for that you should just find an antennia at Puyallup that you like 
and fill the rest of the holes.  Try checking all the buses in the show area 
and out in the large parking lot for antennias you might want to buy in the 
swap meet.   Eric&amp;Barb
