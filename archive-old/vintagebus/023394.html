 Enter it in the registry, and then do a search for yourself, and it
 will decode all the stuff.
 
 You *can put fresh-air heater boxes in an early car, but you either
 have to (ahem) clearance the two sponts on the firewall where
 they'll hit, or make some (ahem) adjustments to the heater boxes
 themselves.  

actually no, you just have to wiggle it in.   My first splitty was an early 
59 with a 1500 in it, and I didn't realise you were supposed to be able to 
roll the engine straight in for a few years.   Though I have seen people mush 
or bend or cut things to do this  :(

I was able to get repro heater boxes and a 1600 into my
 '56 with no real problems.  You also need to &quot;dip&quot; the motor slightly
 to get the front part of the heater boxes under the firewall, then
 flatten it out and it should go right in.
  &gt;&gt;

I would get one heater box forward of the firewall, line up the spline from 
the tranny, then wiggle the other heater box unde rthe firewall, then push it 
forward and attach those bolts.
