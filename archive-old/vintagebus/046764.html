Subject: Jerome Jamboree Raffle bus
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

    This year the ABC is raffling off a 1962 sub-hatch camper at Jerome 
Jamboree.  We are a little behind schedule in getting everything done on this 
bus......it may not make it to the Classic weekend, unfortunately.  We are 
trying, but not sure.  The bus is relatively complete and in good shape - 
never been hit or anything like that.  In fact the &quot;Wish list&quot; on this one is 
very simple: the cargo doors (Kombi) need replacing or at least the bottom 6 
or so inches (tops off of panel doors would work), a couple of the pop-out 
frames are a little more rusted than we would like to put back on, and of 
course, we need all the rubber.  The engine was a runner, but it's getting 
freshend up thanks to Jim Burnite of Yuma, AZ.  The body is getting cleaned 
up thanks to a hose of folks and once we get it back together and on the 
road, we will evaluate the rest of the mechanicals (brakes, etc.)  We hope to 
have a much more complete wish list up on the ABC web page soon (Kyle, get it 
Everett).

Anyway, if anyone can help us out with any of the above mentioned parts we 
would be eternally grateful and mention your name(s) whenever possible.  

TIA,

Jon Stanton
