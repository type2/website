Propane is heavier than air.  This is why, by law, propane tanks in vehicles
and vessels must be stored in a &quot;gas tight&quot; space with a vent/drain to the
outside atmosphere located at the LOWEST point of the storage space.  The
vent/drain fitting cannot protrude above the low point of the storage space,
as this would allow gas to be trapped in a pool around the fitting.

With the exception of specialized appliances like the PROPEX units, with
direct outside venting of combustion products, good ventilation is a must
when using a propane-burning appliance inside your bus/van.  No matter how
sophisticated or expensive the appliance might be, in the absence of direct
venting it's combustion products and oxygen depletion are DEADLY.

Every year people die in tents, boats, campers, etc. while using combustion
heaters, even when they leave windows, tent flaps, air vents, etc. OPEN.  If
you perceive this as an overstatement of the hazard I suggest you contact
your friendly local fire department, Coast Guard station, SAR organization,
or medical examiner for further information and case histories.

In many situations the admonition to &quot;always keep those tanks upright&quot; is
accurate.  However, RV, marine, and industrial vehicle propane tanks are
often specifically designed and engineered to be stored and used in a
horizontal position.  Storing or using those tanks in an upright position
would be incorrect and potentially hazardous.

&gt;&gt; you can get a little 5 or 10lb. tank, they are nice and small, will fit
in any westy cabinet or closet and you wont have to keep a window open.
should burn for about 5-8 hours. plenty for a weekend. the grill tanks are
20lb.ers, too big to haul around. i have a 10lb. in my bus withh a hose
running to a coleman stove and small round heater.

NOTE: BTW, ALWAYS KEEP THOSE TANKS UPRIGHT &lt;&lt;
