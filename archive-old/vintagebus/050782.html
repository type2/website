Subject: RE: [VB] throttle cable cuts trans

ok, i catually measured mine last weekend, and it's 597mm (23.88inches) end
to end. the one end snugly fits onto the accelerator cable tube that's next
to the clutch cable tube, and the other end has a flared out end, similar
to the end of a trumpet, that fits over the metal tube that runs through
the fan shroud. parts book (on vintagebus_dot_com) lists part number as
111-721-551 (shorten to 670mm), at least i think that is what it is
specifying by the description. i know there are different length bowden
tubes available for this application, but i think i found mine on busses in
junkyards. all i know is that the 597mm one works very well in my '59 with
a 1600 single port in it. it was also in my '61 with the same engine combo.

&gt; &gt; My throttle cable is ever so slowly sawing through my transmission
&gt; &gt; case. I think I can stop it with a piece of rubber fuel line, but why
&gt; &gt; is this happening?
&gt; &gt; In my bus the throttle cable emerges from its tube beneath the bus at
&gt; &gt; about the same area as the nose of the trans, then runs exposed (and
&gt; &gt; touching the trans in one spot) until it enters the short tube running
&gt; &gt; through the forwardmost piece of engine tin and the fan shroud. Am I
&gt; &gt; missing any pieces here, some kind of bowden tube or something? Was
&gt; &gt; there a housing over the exposed cable?
