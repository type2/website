have you considered a radiant heater from an old cabover camper or motorhome. my last cabover, a '73 vacationeer, had a radiant
heater which vented to the outside. it required a space aprox 12&quot;x12&quot;x12&quot; for install. would appear no worse than a elect outlet on
a typical westy. i sold that camper for $300.00
because the cabover bed was sagging. all the appliances worked fine. just an idea. good luck.
