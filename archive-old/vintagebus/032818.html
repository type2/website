&lt;&lt; I think the stock type bus muffler looks good, but a friend of mine says 
he went back to one and lost power. I need all the power I can get since I 
will be pulling a trailer. I'm running a 1600 DP with dual Kadrons.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
For 1641cc engines not pushed over 4,000 RPM the stock muffler should be just 
fine.  If your friend did/does not go over this RPM most likely he needed to 
change his carb jetting to match the stock muffler that has more back 
pressure and thusly the engine needs less fuel poured through it to keep the 
air fuel mixture at the proper ratio to provide both best HP and cool engine. 
 Which for him probably resulted in too rich of mixture!  The jetting also 
has to be changed when air cleaner/s are replaced with differant one/s or 
even when installing the engine in a differant engine compartment (Type 2 to 
1 or even to KG).  Only after 1967 did VW redesign the air intakes in the bus 
to match air flow in the bug.

PS Remind us early next week and we will see if we can figure out how to send 
you an image of a page of hitches from our 1966 dealer accessories catolog.
