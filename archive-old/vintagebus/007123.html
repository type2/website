whoa whoa whoa....hey there guy - I never EVER said &quot;Terry Mercer sent me
hate mail&quot;. and why not? because you didn't. I have no clue what your
talking about. There were a few ppl who sent me some not so nice letters,
and unless your a schizophrenic and your OTHER name begins with a G or a P,
then its obviously not you....helpful hint: don't call ppl names unless you
know your facts.  Unless of course your referring to a different Wade like
&quot;Daniel Wade&quot; or something...far as I've seen, I'm the only one with the
first name Wade, who posted referring to hate mail received. Calm down.

Subject: disc brake conversion


&gt;I have been thinking about what I need to do concerning the brakes on my
'59
&gt;and I've decided to go with discs.  My question is...should I consider
doing
&gt;the rears also since I will be swapping out the tranny.  I found a deal on
a
&gt;beater '75 and got the front axle and the transmission to do the swap.  I
&gt;called up Kennedy Engineering and they tell me that I can get an adaptor
kit
&gt;to hook up.
&gt;
&gt;Any and all help welcome...I appreciate the open-mindedness of the majority
&gt;of the list members with the exception of Mr. Brian Wittling who is a total
&gt;c*cksucking fag and Wade, who is a liar...I never once sent Wade any hate
&gt;mail of any sort but he felt the need to post to the list that I did.  I
did
&gt;however send Mr. Wittling a not-so-nice reply to his smart-ass,
small-minded
&gt;response to my original post.
&gt;
&gt;Everyone else have a very nice day.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Terry
