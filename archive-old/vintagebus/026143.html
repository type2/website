Rex,

When I put the steering box back in mine, I used 8 of the cement wall blocks.
They were laying such that the smallest dimension was vertical.  Stacking two
on the ground and two on top of those two, gave me a long platform of just shy
of 12&quot;.  I jacked the truck up one bit at a time until I was able to get the
blocks under the wheels.

Bottom line is that if the wheels are 12&quot; off the ground, you should be able to
easily get the box in.
