Subject: Re: [VB]  6 volt  to 12 volt conversion, is it that easy?

Works great and spins right up.  You will want to put a 12V solenoid on
the starter though as the 6V one will slam the gear into the flywheel so
hard that it will bounce back out and tear up your ring gear.

&gt;What about voltage regulator, that would have to be change to a 12 Volt,
right?

Right.
