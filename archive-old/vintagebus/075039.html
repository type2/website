Bob, list,










I can suggest two places to meet and greet on Saturday. 










Right after the OCTO show at JT Schmid's brew pub, I'll buy  your first pint
of 


ale or root beer! It's directly south of the Pond across Katella. We've done



this for the last 4 years or so and fill up a couple of tables. Warning,
you'll 


probably miss the Toy &amp; Lit. show! 










The VTO club hosts a campout Saturday evening, 


http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~octo.info/ at beautiful Lake Irvine, just a few
miles 


in the foothills. 






 Not sure if you can get a day pass into the area if you don't camp. About
$15 a 


vehicle for overnight.  There will be a lot of listees around the campfire.
Most 


of the AZ crew, a few of us from Fresno, etc. A Navy Dave raffle and auction
is 


not to be missed. The VTO crew are great hosts and their event t-shirt from
a 


couple of years ago is still my favorite VW shirt. 










  -Harry in Fresno














          


&gt; Greetings all from sunny So Cal. I was thinking (That can be dangerous) 
&gt; since the OCTO/Classic weekend is upon us and alot of us here on the list 
&gt; will be in town for it(OK I live here)that possibly Saturday night we
could 
&gt; pick a place and all meet up and have a lil grindage (food and drink) and 
&gt; meet one another? Anyone Game?
&gt; 
&gt; Bob
