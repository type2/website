&gt;Well i will open this up with a question of length on splitty roof
&gt;racks--they do come in many sizes---from 1/4--1/2--3/4--and &quot;full&quot;
&gt;length--so my question is--what is the &quot;correct&quot; length of a Full Length
&gt;metal roof rack for a splitty bus that was made by VW?
&gt;

Most people consider the eight foot long racks as full length.  Those racks
have three legs on each side.  There is a 9 foot long rack, and it has four
legs on each side.  Both racks (among other lengths) were sold through the
VWOA dealer network since the 50's.
I have seen early literature and bubble window literature with the same style
racks.  This is assuming you are talking about the tubular metal racks.  Do
what you like, it's your bus.  What are you going to carry up there?
