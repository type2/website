Subject: Removing Stickers
Date: Wed, 8 Jul 1998 05:40:13 -0700 

Aways back there was a question posed as to 
how best to remove stickers, including bumper
stickers and the inevitable Grateful Dead stickers 
from one's bus with the intent to re-use them
or cash them in at the local head shop.

Checking out a randomly received catalog I
came across a product that seems too good
to be true.  It temporarily releases the sticker
goo and allows removal without messing the
sticker or the surface it's on.

Anyway, I haven't tried it, and the website doesn't
say where to find it, but here's the website that
describes the product:

http://www.doumar_dot_com/undu/index2.htm

I suspect that it can be found in stationary stores.
The catalog I found it in has a website, but 
I couldn't find it on there.

http://www.improvementscatalog_dot_com

Expensive at $12.99 for two 1 oz bottles
from that catalog.
