&gt; On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right at 
&gt; the bend. I have tried many different &quot;high heat&quot; exhaust repairs, but as 
&gt; of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days.

Hi Jason,
If the hole is due to internal corrosion then the same problem is happening 
along the entire length of the heat riser tube, and once you repair it the 
problem is more than likely to rear its ugly head again, and again, and 
again.....  BTDT with house plumbing!  If the hole is due to someone drilling 
it through there then having it welded is about the only easy ansewer that 
will work.
  If you manifold was a super rare item you could cut out the entire heat 
riser out of the aluminum casting around it and the intake manifold and have 
new tubing bent, new ends welded on and weld the heat riser back in place 
inside the aluminum casting.  Since it is a commonly found swap part there 
really is no need for that level of repair!
