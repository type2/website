&gt; Type 1 powered bay window buses (stock):
&gt; 
&gt; 5.375 R&amp;P, .82 4th, and stock 25.7&quot; tires
&gt; 65mph _at_ 3741rpm, 69mph _at_ 4000rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; Type 4 powered bay window buses (stock):
&gt; 
&gt; 4.857 R&amp;P, .89 4th, and stock 25.7&quot; tires
&gt; 65mph _at_ 3688rpm, 71mph _at_ 4000rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, even with the extra cooling of a T-4, the tallest VW geared 
&gt; it
&gt; was the equivelant of putting a 3.88 R&amp;P into a stock big-nut trans. The 
&gt; 1971
&gt; Bay window bus, with the 1600DP (pretty equivelant to us putting 1600DP's in
&gt; our splitties), is only doing 169rpm less at 65mph than the stock trans. A
&gt; stock big-nut trans only spins the motor 222rpm more than a T-4 powered bus 
&gt; to
&gt; do 65mph. Interesting info, seems VW had a &quot;sweet spot&quot; they liked to keep
&gt; these motors running at.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than 195/50r15's, I wasn't sure what other size tires people like to 
&gt; run
&gt; when they do straight axle/IRS conversions. If someone tells prefered tire
&gt; sizes and gear combo's, i'll add it to the list.
&gt; 

Hmmm I thought my bus was overgeared. IRS 4.37 R&amp;P, .89 4th, and stock 25.8&quot; 
diameter tires: Guess I,ll have to wait for them tyres to wear out. Mike
