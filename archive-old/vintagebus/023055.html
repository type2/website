&gt;I have a couple of those cushions- the rear ones, if someone is

Yeah, I have the red rear cushions with white piping.  But my front seats
don't match...they're gray or maybe salt &amp; pepper (they're pretty
thrashed).  Clara, if you mean you just have the covers...email me, I want em.

&gt;hey the kamper kit 
&gt;was gone, maybe it was a Kamper Kit camper too.  Maybe I should check the M 
&gt;code tag and see if it was sent to San Francisco, what is that code for
SF?   
&gt;F?  It has older white/green plates, but don't think they are correct for
the 
&gt;year the bus was made, so it could have been a california car.  It has that 
&gt;foam stuff stuck to the walls and ceiling, you know the stuff that acts like 
&gt;a sponge to rust the bus.

Okay, let me nip this one in the bud right now.  The wood currently in my
bus was put there by the 2nd owner who rebuilt the interior and also lived
in the Bay Area.

Last night I got pictures from Greg Banfill of a 66 Riviera he has and the
interior is virtually identical!!  Right down to the knobs.  So I am fairly
confident in saying I own a Riviera.  

So how to explain the Kamper Kits writing on parts of the wood?  I would
venture to say that the 2nd owner may have had KK cut the new wood for the
interior while he lived in the Bay Area.  It certainly is a possibility.

San Francisco code is UF.  My bus was delivered into Jacksonville, FL (UJ).

I know this solves nothing in the larger picture save for maybe the fact
that Rivieras are the true bastard son of VW campers...I've never seen two
*exactly* alike.  :)
