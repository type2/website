Subject: Re: [VB] anyone got contacts

It takes a great deal of social engineering to finagle parts from the
hoarders.  They're picky who they sell to, because they expect a quid-pro-quo
when they sell something; it's not just the cash - they want an opportunity
to buy something rare from you.   They're doing you a *favor* by selling
you the parts at a premium.

It's part of the elitist culture.

In some cases, you just have to suck up and use the repro part.  If an NOS
one accidently pops up later, great, but otherwise, why postpone assembly
indefinitely for some pipsqueak items?

&gt; Either I've never contacted one of these 'hoarders' or I haven't made my
&gt; point in cash clear.
