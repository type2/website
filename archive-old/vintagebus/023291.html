Subject: Installing Westy Tent Mounts
Mime-Version: 1.0

Anyone on the list ever install a set of westy tent mounts on a bus that
didn't originally have them?  I'm sick of scraping undercoarting off of the
'54, and looking for something more fun to do.

What I'm really after is what the front bumper mount looks like; I have a
spare one, but it was from a ribbed bumper, and I'm not sure if it's the
same as the late bumper mounts.
