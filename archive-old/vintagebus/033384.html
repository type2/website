Subject: jalousie windows
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

ive had a helluva time trying to find jalousie windows if ANYONE knows where 
i can get some please email me.

just to brag....i scored my 1964 91k original mile bus absolutley no rust on 
underside (some on rockers) converted into westy in the 60's all original 
(besides camper stuff) for 500!! the story goes somebody got a really 
exspensive cost no object conversion way back and got the thickest nicest 
(for early paint jobs anyway) paint job which totally saved the bus from 
rust. orginal engine wheels jack etc retiained. this is my first bus and i 
have been reading and learning about them for almost a year now. i am very 
familiar with type ones but man i love busses way more. my resto will be 
similar to texas type 2 guys and i will be posting a site soon. also any one 
in san antonio tx email me id love to hear from you.
                                                thanks for reading
                                                  phil (another 16 year old)
