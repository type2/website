Subject: Compression ratios on SP engine + clutch disc question

SP 1600cc going in a 69 bus:

These are the numbers if I use 0.06 inch cylinder shims:

1 - 7.11
2 - 7.03
3-  7.16
4-  7.15

Would you settle for this or have custom shims made? It looks dang pretty
close to me. Is the jury in on the paper gaskets? Where would I put them
anyway with the shims in place?

The guy at the FLAPS suggests a HD clutch disc. Same size, heavier springs.
Is made for some diesel application. What do you think? (He also wanted me
to use a modified cam but I declined). :-)
