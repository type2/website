I have pulled with different vehicles, last 3 years 2 4x4 Frd bronco's ,but 
my present is by far the best, 92 Ford F-250 / dually conversion on rear and 
sleeper unit joined to cab , 5.8 full fuel injected small block. A4od 
tranny(expensive to have rebuilt ask me how i know,Also you must lock out OD 
when towing.) , the only thing i would do different is a crew cab and 
straight gear, the dually part makes it alot more stable ( no dancing when 
you hit the bottom of a hill at 65 ) I call it my 1 ton wanna be ,,Later
