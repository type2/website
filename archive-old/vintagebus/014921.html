I've seen an early '60s kombi floral delivery truck
with very nice flowers and the name of the flower
shop.  It was white inside and out with bright white
with silver lettering.  Very subtle and subdued. 
Sitting in a field, the original &quot;flower power&quot; bus.

&gt; when i got my 57 single cab it had &quot;custom garden

&gt; only read it in the right moonlight deals......so i
&gt; sanded it down and found
&gt; &quot;Qualität drapes and upholstery&quot; underneath that :) 
&gt;  In each box indent on
&gt; the gates it said &quot;pruning&quot; then &quot; trimming&quot; then
&gt; &quot;lawn maint.&quot;
&gt; Just pick a theme and go with it :) will be cool
&gt; whatever you choose.
