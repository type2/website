OK, OK from what Dr.Robt Davis said, it sounded like I was practicing my
Robert Dinero impression at the OCTO meet. =) &lt;You tawkin ta me?&gt;

My take on arrival to the OCTO meet was that I was being lead to the &quot;show&quot;
area when all of a sudden my wife started shouting that a group of people
were shouting at me to veer into another direction. God forbid that I not
heed my dear wife's insistence! The grey and black barnambulator was
immediately steered into the direction of my wife's pleading. The waving and
shouting was from my Brother in law and plenty of Phoenix Fire Dept's best
who had a nice 66 gulf blue and white bus for sale. We wanted to park next
to them. The anal pattern for parking wasnt immediately obvious when some
guy started giving me crap about how and where to park. I thought that the
person who was being &quot;Mr. Director&quot; was being overly picky. The last thing
that I wanted to do was to be jerked around all morning. I mean this was the
OCTO! There were deals with my name on them to be found!!!! (Basically, I
was full of myself and wanting to get out of the bus...)

&quot;Turn your bus around and park the other way and straighten your tires and...&quot;

At the same time I had the lovely and always cooperative Mrs. VanBondo in
the other ear while the fire department guys were swarming the bus on the
blind side. The bus has no rear window so backing the bus is always a treat.

Pffft! Being totally over whelmed, I meant to ask if the fella was &quot;joking
about how to park&quot; but my actual comment was accurately reported to the list
in Dr. Bob's trip report. The words of the silver tounged devil just came
flying out of my mouth. &lt;Sorry for being such of a smart*ss Robert!~ I'd
think that anyone who said that to me was a total jerk!&gt; Good thing that I'm
not huh? Seems that I have earned at least one broken nose that way. ;-)

My trip report could go into a twelve part manifesto but I will suffice to
say that it was an excellent weekend. The '54 Barndoor made the journey in
both directions and everyone is home safe and happy. Average speed was about
52 miles per hour excepting the 25-35mph grind westbound through Banning
pass in Friday rush hour traffic and the 30mph grind up the eastbound Indio
hill on I-10 eastbound in 100 degree heat and non-stop Semitrucks. 

Weekend Summary:
Overloaded Barndoors can go 4 wheeling in search of Christmas tree farms,
you can drive in LA rush hour with a broken shift coupler, Ralph's Markets
carry band clamps in the hardware aisle, Abduhl at the gas stn needs to
learn English, Swisher Sweets cost $1.57 in Phoenix and $2.85 per pack after
dark in Riverside,CA's scaryier neighborhoods, wires for cyls 2 and 3 should
not be crossed and 36hp isn't like the full flowed 1776 with all of the
go-fast tricks. Whew!
