yes mostly buses pre 398 xxx have the body number stamped in the bulkhead 
behind the pass seat rather than have an M code tag.      I had a bus that 
was chassis # about 443 xxx that had a body number stamped in it, though   
hm???
 a 60 panel would not have a body number stamped there, but have an M code tag

yes this is the body number, NOT the chassis or VIN number.  On those buses, 
the CHASSIS/VIN  is on the plate in the engine compartment as well as stamped 
in the area just to the right of the apron.    why there is a separate body 
number on the earlier buses I have no clue.  Like you can put a new body on 
the chassis?  what?

sounds like the inspection people were mixed up about where the VIN was and 
thought the body number is the VIN.  It will work fine for identifying the 
bus (who checks anyway?) as long as you dont cut out the bulkhead.
.......................................................
Another question about VIN numbers this time. What's the deal with the
body number on the passenger side bulkhead being different than the
chassis number stamped on the metal plate in the engine compartment. The
bus I'm referring to is my 56 panel. My 60 panel had all matching
numbers. The 56's title goes by the body number on the bulkhead so is
that correct for the VIN number. Would it be correct to dial the
bulkhead number into the vintagebus database or the metal plate engine
compartment number?

&gt; &gt; Could be but actually mine was built in Nov of 57 and to get on another
&gt; topic that I don't recall is... is my bus a 58 or 57 model year?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; According to my NEATO book, the 1958 model year started August 1, 1957.  You
&gt; are correct in that the model years do vary at times.  The &quot;standard&quot; August
&gt; model yearing schema began in August, 1955 with 1956 vehicles, thus many
&gt; people consider '55s more scarce due to the reduced model year (Jan-August).
