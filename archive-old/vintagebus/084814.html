&gt;While we're on the subject of chemicals, does anyone know of a retail
&gt;source for Ate brake cylinder paste?

The part number seems to be 03.9902-0501.2 .  Lots of sites in Germany
have it for aroud EUR10-EUR11 but none of them want to talk about
shipping costs.

(No extra charge for the &quot;VBScript Fehler&quot;)

Ebarf Germany (item 7995361621)

It also seems to be an OEM specified part for at least Porsche and
Mercedes - you might try a dealer.  There will be a substantial extra
charge for the logo.  The offical VW part number from the 1967 catalog
is &quot;B 1&quot; for a 180 g tube - for a laugh, ask a VW dealer.

I found one reference saying Girling makes a similar paste.

There is a place here in town that does brakes and clutches for vehicles
and industrial equipment.  They are a Bendix dealer, but they'll work on
lots of stuff.  Someplace like that might be a good place to check.

In searching, it also seems like some people use &quot;brake paste&quot; to mean
the stuff you squirt on the back of disc brake pads to stop them
squealing.  This is most definitely _not_ what you want to put inside
the hydraulic system.
