&gt; I have complete German exhaust systems for $99.95.  These are complete kits,
&gt; with muffler, damper pipe, tailpipe, brackets, hardware, etc.  They fit
&gt; 1500-1600cc engines, and yes, they are Bus kits (single-tailpipe) not bug
&gt; kits.  The good German stuff has indeed been hard to find in the U.S. for a
&gt; while (and terribly expensive when available), so I've been importing these
&gt; directly from Germany myself.

I just installed one of these exhausts (Liestritz) and have to say that it
was a pleasure to work with.  Be sure to get high-quality installation
kits to go with it.  The new ones have one bolt instead of two and a
wire-mesh donut instead of the fiberous one.

The difference between the exhausts isn't all that much, but the attention
to detail and tolerances in the Liestritz part eliminates most of the
banging and cussing.
