Subject: [VB] cam bore alignment


... how does one go about checking whether a cam bore is aligned properly?
is there a spec of how far off parallell to the case half it can be?
anything i need besides a steel straitedge?

That question has been around a long time, but mostly the hot rodders know
the answer. Back in the late 70's and early eighties when they started
messing with Chevy rods, type IV, porche, and Chevy mains, there came a
question of clearance. I beam and H beam rods were thinner and didn't force
the engine builder to move everything else around, but the larger
components, including Hi lobe race cams proved to be a serious clearance
problem. 

Generally, you are allowed 3 degrees tilt max on any one lifter. The pushrod
riding in the cup of the lifter tilts farther and farther towards the lip of
the lifter cup as it travels upward and centers as it reaches the farthest
point down. With a tilt to the lifter, this pushrod to lifter lip distance
becomes narrower. Super Vees ran tilted lifters to allow them to run wild
cams. The hydraulic lifters were started out in a tilted bore until custom
lifters made for VW engines became available. Then it was a matter of boring
out the lifter bores to a larger diameter for the lifters and shaving the
face of the bore down. Hydraulic lifter blocks are not as popular anymore,
but those that have them swear they are the quietist thing out there, and
they don't have to adjust there rockers every month!
