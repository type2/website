Hi,

My right rear brake began sticking and dragging. I have honed out the wheel
cylinder, reassembled everything and found that upon trying to bleed the
line, it wouldn't bleed. I tried to blow out the line with compressed air,
to no avail. Next I removed the flexible hose from over the axle and found
that I couldn't blow through it with 120psi air.

Are there some orifices or check valves inside the hose that could clog or
stick?
Anyone with answers?  Thanks.

Chris
