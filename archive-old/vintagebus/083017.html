Damn!!

Matt,

I do believe it could be made to work!!! Only problems I see is that Nixie
Tubes were not especially sunlight visible and I am not sure you can get
them in anything except 0-9. Hell, why not spell everything out in 1's and
0's in hex ascii!!  Brilliant!!   Would look Dyn-O-Mite at night!! All them
blinkin 1's and 0's. Homeland security would go nuts trying to decode that
mess.

Would take a lot off effort to collect the old parts unless you have an
electronics surplus store in your neighborhood with some old equipment that
contains enough Nixie's.The multivibrator and transformer could be had from
an old radio.

Let me know how the design comes along. Maybe I can help!  I am an old tube
guy myself. Those new fangled solid state jobs are just too fragile! Hit hem
with an overvoltage and all the smoke comes out. Those old tubes can glow
almost white before they go bad.

Chris
