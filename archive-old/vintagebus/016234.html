I found KYBs are extremely stiff and had a terrible
ride compared to stock...especially for early 3-4ton
buses.  Go with nice stock oil filled Boge or
Sachs...brazil stuff is ok but german is better.

The shocks have nothing to do with your load carrying
ability...so don't buy heavy duty or gas filled shocks
just haul stuff...it is not needed.

&gt; The shocks themselves are plain red, no significant
&gt; markings.  So far
&gt; they work great.

&gt; &gt; I run the GR-2 KYBs on my 67 Kombi.  they are a

&gt; &gt; the cheap black brazilian ones work fine for
&gt; every-day driving.
