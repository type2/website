Subject: Too much grease?

I remember Muir saying VW differed with US manufacturers on wheel grease application. Let the other shoe drop, Karl, why will the bearing overheat with TOO much grease?  
My guess is that  a nearly packed cavity would generally conduct heat away from the bearing and not warm up and flow through the bearing evenly. Then dry spots could develop and perhaps grow and strand the bearing? Kind of like frosting in a mixer, it ends up on the sides of the bowl and the beaters spin dry?
