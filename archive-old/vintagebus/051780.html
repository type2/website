Subject: RE: [VB] Need for speed - limit

Just like when I'm cruising at 80 mph and a car just has to pass me because
I'm in a bus. Then they look down at there speedo and slow back down and I
pass them again.

Hi Ray,
I've noticed this too.  Any air-cooled VW and people feel like they have
to be in front of you.  Old busses make them feel like they may even need
to go to extremes to do this.

&gt; Anyway, front tire hieght is what I'm looking for I guess. Thanks

library under tires and go down to Kabayo's contribution.
