That clip is from one of the movies in the &quot;Faces of Death&quot; series.  It is a 
series of videos that shows actual footage of all sorts of horrific 
disasters.  I believe in one they show auto crashes on the autobahn and in 
the background you can see a few beetles.  I think they were mostly 70's 
vintage.

It is a really strange set of videos and not to be watched if you have a 
weak stomach.  VERY GRUESOME!!!!

----It was said------

Heres a short video i had in my collection, Anyone ever seen this? Whats it
for or from?
