Subject: Josh Rogers Funeral Perspective

What a wonderful celebration of the life of Josh Rogers.  Josh's friends
and family need to be commended on the wonderful and tasteful job they did
on the entire ceremony.

The morning of Dec. 18, I met up with Charlie Ford at Chad Cantwell's
house.  Got to ride in the infamous &quot;mother ship&quot; to the church.  It is
always fun to listen to Charlie, but today the conversation was a bit
subdued.  Charlie and I both agreed, this was not the place we wanted to
be, but we were really glad that we made it.

We arrived at the church early, so we had plenty of time to check out the
decorations and bulletin board Josh's brother had put together.  I must
have counted at least 3 dozen flower arrangements.  The one arrangement
that really caught my eye was a two foot diameter VW symbol in blue and
white flowers.

The casket was closed during the ceremony, but was made from beautiful
walnut stained oak.  Josh would have really appreciated the craftsmanship.

The service started with Josh's brother who had put together along with one
of Josh's coworkers a wonderful power point slide show about Josh's life.
The slide show really set the tone for the service as the back ground music
was the famous tune from Steppin Wolf, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;.  Josh had a
very full short life.  Not many people can not even come close to
accomplishing everything Josh did.

By the way, I am told the slide show along with the power point viewer
program will be downloadable from Josh's web site soon.  As for Josh's web
site, his friends are going to try and keep it going for at least 5 years
so people can continue to add to the technical library.

The minister did have a lot of good things to say about Josh, including the
fact that Josh had ask God into his life about a year ago when he was
having hard times.  The minister did say that no one knows what was going
on in Josh's head last Monday, but Josh did leave a note and wanted
everyone to know that he will miss them and hopes that no one will be mad
at him.

After the ceremony, Josh was wheeled out to the foray and the casket was
opened as the attendees filed by.  I agreed with some of Josh's friends, he
really didn't look natural dressed in his suit.  He really needed a tank
top and shorts to be the Josh we all remembered.  On the way by, Charlie
did drop a type2_dot_com window sticker in Josh's casket.

On the way to the cemetery, I did have the honor of driving the '67 westy
that Josh repaired for his friend Chad as a gift.  Chad was a pallbearer
and couldn't drive his bus.  There were 6 busses and one bug along with
many other non-VW's in the very long procession.  A number of Josh's
friends wanted to drive their buggies, but it was a very cold, wet and
windy day.

A number of friends and relatives gathered after the service for dinner and
a party in Josh's name.  It was a very festive party that lasted late into
the night.  The only thing missing at the party was a famous Josh Rogers
teepee bone fire with a VW case burning on the top!

It was a wonderful celebration of life and I was very glad that I went.  It
was a good way to close out his life, but his memories will live on in all
of us.
