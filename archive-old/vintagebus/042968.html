&gt; Use roofing tar between the glass and rubber, also between the rubber and
&gt; body.  

On a newly restored bus? Heck no!  I had my large windows installed at
Beverly Hills Auto Glass at the end of the restoration, and watched them
do it. They used a special clear prep liquid to clean the rim areas, then
used a clear sealing agent, then popped in the windows. Leaks? None. The
same windows had leaked just a week earlier when they were installed
without any sealer. Then I decided to get them done correctly. 
If you are near LA, I recommend them highly - family owned for decades.
