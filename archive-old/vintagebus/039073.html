Subject: Cylinder fit?  And rods on the crank - NOT!
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 15:26:52 -0500

When test-fitting all the pieces on the engine for my 58 (dual relief
case from a 74 bug, bored out for 90.5 P&amp;C), I've noticed that the
cylinders fit into the case and into the heads very loosely.  Enough so
that I can rock them to and fro just a bit.  

Is this normal?  Is it because of the different expansion/contraction
rates of the metal?  Just looking for some reassurrance before I
continue.
---
Also, for anyone about to assemble their rods to the crank:  As you all
know, the bumps on the rods face 'up', right?  Well, this means 'up'
when the rods are positioned as they will be when the crank is installed
(spread-eagle if you will with #1 and 2 pointing one way and #3 and 4
pointing the other way), NOT 'up' when the rods are all pointing the
same direction (like a dog sleeping on his side).  But if you DO make
this mistake, it IS correctable with much nashing of teeth and tearing
of knuckles without having to re-split the case.  Not that I'd know this
for any particular reason....  :-)

Thanks in advance!
