I guess I should jump in here.  &quot;Riding&quot; the clutch is when you rest
your foot on it while driving, thus taking up the slack and engaging the
throwout bearing against the pressure plate.  The throwout bearing will
eventually toast, since it is made to be used only sometimes, not
continuously, and the clutch will slip, just a tiny bit, and cause the
friction disk to wear.  There's nothing wrong with using the clutch at
the stoplight.  The t.o. bearing a simple thrust bearing, and is
designed to be loaded against the pressure plate.  It's not necessary to
shift out and back into gear for a minute or two of stopping.  I've
always used the clutch to wait at traffic lights, and they go 50k miles
or so, at least as long as the clutch plate.  If you shift in/out of
gear at every stoplight, the clutch plate will go first, if not the
gearbox.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Have you ever removed your engine and seen where and how the t.o. bearing

&gt; 
&gt; Yes
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Am I the only
&gt; &gt; one that keeps the car in first, and holds the pedal down?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope that you stop doing that. Your
&gt; throwout bearing is pressing against the rotating pressure plate with
&gt; several hundred pounds of pressure. It's a small fairly humble bearing,
&gt; and it doesn't ask much during its life, except not to use it too much.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your concern,  another old habit to break.  As I said, 25 miles
&gt; since
&gt; replacement, could it wear in this short period? Well either way I've got some
&gt; work to do.
