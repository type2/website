Subject: Day 3   od 2nd field bus revival 

Day 2 &amp; 3 (wed &amp;Thurs) Pulled, cleaned, regrease wiper motor, tested it (nice) and replaced it.   replaced a couple side window seals while Greg pulled the engine Engine and gas tank.  The engine compartment was cleaned with copious amounts of simple green, super clean, scrub brash, and a electric pressure washer.      Pulled the windsheilds (one cracked). cleaning up around the window areas.  Greg attacked the rear brakes including new flex lines, tranny mounts and axle boots.  
new shocks
the steering damper makes horrible moaning noises like a ghosts and needs to be decently laid to rest.
 
started front brakes (everything is pulled apart) I greased the suspension and adjusted the link pins (not bad, actually) Lind talked to the upholstery guy about getting the seats to get restitched where the seams are coming apart.  I got the other side windows in with new seals.   Stole windsheilds from anoter bus to have a nice pair, they went in with molded corner seals... which were easier to install... but there was something a little wierd about them... i am not sure what.   The package from Ronnie in Havasu showed up yesterday (via Kentucky???????) so have more parts.  Lind scared up a new fuel sender to replace the dead one, and installed it and the gas tank in the shiny white engine area.
 
aim is to drive this bus down to LA for the OCTO/Classic.
