Subject: RE: [VB] re:rhino liner

Whoa, peace Rex!! I was only saying that because I've been in that
situation before!

Everyone is chatting about how they want to spray Rhino-liner all over
their buses and I was just adding a friendly reminder that this stuff is
MUCH worse than just a layer of paint or some other coating to remove. I
was using the term &quot;jackass&quot; in general and not pointing any fingers at
anyone. 

I have no beef against you or anyone else on here, just putting some
words of caution out.

My apologies for any hard feelings...

PS - Soon to be Rhino-lined too. :)

I hope at the same time he's cussing the same Jackass (me) for taking a 
basket case bus and putting it back on the road.

I personally could give a rat's ass what some new owner thinks about
what 
I've done to my bus. If they don't like it they don't have to buy it.
It's 
mine right now and IF I choose to Rhino Liner the bed....so be it.

I'm not here to serve others opinions of how what is the &quot;correct&quot; way
to 
make my truck a functional vehicle again. That's why I prefaced the 
question with the fact that it won't be a stock restoration.

I'm pretty sure everyone knows that if you don't do something stock that

there are people that won't agree. Do we have to go through this every 
single time someone on this list asks a question that doesn't fit
other's 
opinion of a stock job?

Maybe an over-reaction on my part....but being called a jackass doesn't
sit 
well with me.
