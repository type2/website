Subject: Thinking of looking for another bus . . .
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,
I'm considering selling my '74 super convertible that I drive during warmer 
months daily and getting an older vw if I can find the right one... but I 
feel the right bus would motivate me to sell the bug!
Busses i'm interested in:
'58 and earlier busses/single cab (no panels... I've already got my baby!)
15 window deluxes (I'd love a 23, but the prices are crazy!!!)
flip seat westy!!!!! 
Any other really original busses considered
ideally really solid, og paint, driver ... more og, the better (no projects, 
i've had my share of a project for a long time)
I'm just dabbling as of now, but isn't that what we all do sometimes
I'm in IL, but that really doesn't matter.
Also ragtop oval bugs...
We can dream can't we!!!
Thanks, 
Pete
