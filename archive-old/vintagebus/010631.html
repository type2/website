 &gt; Both pins seem to be welded to the handle, and lots
 &gt; of tapping, penetrating oil, and some heat hasn't  
 &gt; caused them to budge.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any ideas?
 
 More heat, more time with the penetrating oil, better
 penetrating oil(s), and (although I don't believe in
 it) prayer.

ditto.   though why do you want to take the lever out?  Can't you find any 
other way to torment yourself?  I think AOL ate the original message.  the 
two pins mean one for the Ebrake cables, and the one holding  the lever in 
place?   Does the lever even move at this point?
