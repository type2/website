Subject: Rubber seals for a 67 waste

Hi All,

I bought a 67 Westy pop top from New Mexico and am trying sort out all its
various problems.  Needless to say, every rubber seal should be changed and
my plan is to repaint so, having the seals nearby is helpful.

Two questions:

1. I assume there is more than one manufacturer of rubber seals and
different vendors probably sell higher quality.  Who sells the best?

2.  I don't want to buy piecemeal.  Is there any vendor that would be happy
to make a discounted deal on all the seals as a package?  There are door
seal packages, but I need the seals for the Jalousies, poptop, front/rear
windows, lights, all the pedals and floor related stuff, and the floor mats
and under seat mats.  In a perfect world, the vendor would even make
suggestions on what I might be forgetting. Anyone ever get such a deal?

Thanks!  I hope to be camping in this thing this year!

Clark
