From: Gary Gibson &lt;meckie_at_azstarnet_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Good question Barry.  An issue for the bus list to think about (in terms
&gt; of context) is that post modern thinkers are mostly french!  Gaby Schwab
&gt; is german(alive) and there are plenty of dead german thinkers who
&gt; fostered postmodernism, but as to the context of the List?  I'd say that
&gt; we should do theater, dance and song accompanied by bus exhaust to try
&gt; to deal with our century.  The context of the split window bus is in
&gt; some way clear to us but god knows what the world thinks.  We understand
&gt; the tacit waves from other bus drivers.  We communicate on incredible
&gt; levels  We known what we mean...
