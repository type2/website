Was discussing 6v-12v with a friend last night, 
and he mentioned that there was a heat dissipation
factor... I never considered that before.  
The larger (12v) flywheel can absorb more heat than
the smaller (6v) one can.  It is probably a minimal 
difference, but a lot of minimal differences in cooling
can add up to a cooler running vehicle.  In particular,
a cooler starter which increases starting reliability.
It's been between 101 and 110 this month, where I live,
so cooling issues have been on my mind a lot :-)
