Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Pipe question....

Because the right side of the engine heats the front of the bus......the left
side of the engine heats the rear of the bus. The right side feeds the heater
log under the rear seat on Standards and Deluxes......



&gt; Hi Real Bus People    I just crawled out from under
&gt; Ol'No Name and I have NO CLUE! Why the heat duct pipe
&gt; that goes to the front of the bus from the back on the
&gt; drivers side is capped off where the Y is at the end
&gt; of the heat tube at the back?..Why would the left side
&gt; just not hook into the duct work that runs to the
&gt; front?......It hooks up to a joint that looks like the
&gt; right side but it does not hook into the duct work
&gt; running to the front????? Got a clue?...dont need the
&gt; heat but what the heck!!!!
