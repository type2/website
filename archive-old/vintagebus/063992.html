Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights - update

I do have some wiring left from my stripped a while ago Subaru... those seem
to be a little on a smaller size (gauge) than original but I will see if I
can at least match wire colors.... if not, I'll have to visit a junk yard
(was in my plans anyway) to see if I can find any Bay windows.... (splits I
can forget about - not around here, no way) perhaps a type 3? and get some
wires. I'll be on a lookout for a donor engine.... I know how hard it would
be to find a good engine case to build on.....

I'll see if I can just piece these together and then just go over the wiper
switch... I don't want to brake it... I'll have to remove it somehow and see
if I can loosen it up a bit.

peace,

Dre

&gt; Hi Dre,
&gt; Engine oil, ozone from the generator, or even sulfuric acid fumes from the
&gt; battery or a combination of these, just do that!  You can replace these
&gt; brittle wires with new ones (Talk to &quot;No loose screw too small!&quot; David
about
&gt; sources he found.) or as we have done scavange wires out of wiring
harnesses
&gt; used in 1950s-60s-70s VWs.  We have been collecting boxes of old wiring
&gt; harnesses from totally wrecked VWs and found that the wiring covered by
the
&gt; outer sheath is in new condtion.  All you have to do is to clip off the
old
&gt; wire ends you have solder and heat shrink on new/used wiring and crimp or
&gt; solder on new all brass terminal ends.
