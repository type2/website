One other thing this brings up is the willingness of some folks on the list 
to bash Ebay but their unwillingness to pay a reasonable price for something. 
 I had the NOS German front bumper for sale on the list for several weeks.  
When folks Emailed for details I told them it was worth at least $200 but I 
would take significantly less.  Just checked my RMMW catalog today and a 
*repro* bumper is $315.  

I realize not everyone out there needs a front bumper but when you offer a 
NOS part at a bargain price to the list and nobody acts on it, a seller is 
likely to skip the list and go straight to Ebay next time.  This isn't 
intended as whining - this is a reality check for the gripers out there.  Put 
up or shut up.
