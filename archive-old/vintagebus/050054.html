Subject: Re: [VB] Fluted Bus Headlights for sale

&gt;Me too. (oops, I should have type that in ALL CAPS)
&gt;
&gt;BTW, bulbs for those are $12 from wolfsburg west.  Lars can get the
&gt;yellow ones, though.

I talked to them yesterday.  The guy I talked to said he didn't have yellow
bolbs, except maybe for the parking lights, and that there was no reason to
ever run yellow headlights (I agree).


&gt;
&gt;There are a *lot* of these NOS lights in circulation.

Makes me think that they are really NNS (New New Stock), as in Still In
Production.

&gt;&gt; five sets were sold, including at least one other pair to a VB list member.
&gt;&gt; Another pair of NOS Hella reached $152.50 w/o reaching reserve on Ebay
