The Big Kansas City MoKan Trip - Part 1
================================

 As most of you know, I've spent a lot of time and money on getting a
driveable splitty on the road.  It's a process that started February of 1999
with a rusty 1966 bus for $100 and culminated in a white over red 1967
deluxe w/o sunroof bus with a lot less rust.

 My initial road trip with my splitty was a day trip to Omaha to visit OVWC
members Rob and Justin Laffoon.  The visit was great, the trip was 'okay'
due to the sloppy steering box.  This was the trip that set the stage and
got the ball rolling towards my trip to the June 10th MoKan VW show in
Independence, MO.

 For those of you who don't like the people side of VW road trips and prefer
the technical, I'll go into that now and carry on with the day by day
intinary of my trip.  This post may be several messages long so please
forgive the length.

 For everyone's info, I'm running a Freeway Flyer trans in a 1967 bus that
has a 20,000 mile 1600DP engine from an early 70's Beetle.  It has ample
power when pulling mild grades but may the Good Lord help you if you
encounter a slight headwind or carry a few passengers. With this
configuration, I was able to pack lightly, travel around town, and travel to
Omaha even without overheating.  Once I started hauling loads which were a
mere fraction of the original 1 ton payload capacity for this bus, I would
overheat.  This was totally due to the steeper geared trans and the stock
1600DP that was lugging through the gears.  I've come to appreciate what the
VW engineers knew all along - the trans in a bus is matched to the
anticipated load and wind resistance the bus will encounter vs. the
horsepower and cooling capacity of the engine.  If you screw around with it,
it will cause you problems.  A call to Bernie Bergman as a result of a post
from C R Sauls from the VintageBus list resulted in the advice to add a deep
sump for more oil and to run a Porsche 356 pulley with belt #35015 to
overdrive the generator/fan combo for better cooling.  The result is that it
actually does work but the bad thing is that #1)You are overdriving the fan
and in my case - the fan was bone stock - not welded nor balanced so I never
knew if I was going to blow it up so this #2) resulted in me keeping the
speed to no more than 60 to 65 mph.  Actually, I could never get any faster
than that because I had lugged my engine so much from the steeply geared
trans, heavy load, and robbed it of quite a bit of power by having to
overdrive the fan that my performance was actually the same if not a little
worse than stock!  I did start to overheat on the trip several times despite
the pulley and Berg deep sump (which gave me 6qts. total cap.) but a
downshift to 3rd gear at 40mph for a couple of miles would usually be enough
to turn out the flickering green light of the Berg oil temp dipstick.
Fascinating how we tend to think that going back to stock is slow and
cumbersome and then when we mess with it, we go back to stock and find
ourselves marveling at this engineering wonder called a bus. :-)

 Would I suggest this mod?  Well, I must admit that it did get me to KC and
back with no engine damage but my mileage was terrible (around the 9 to
12mpg range), I drove with the gas floored most of the way, and should you
decide to go this route, start with nothing less than a 1776 with a welded
and balanced fan - keeping in mind that cavitation over the cylinders will
happen at higher rpms.  I'm going to put my sump on the 1776 that I built
but I'm going to leave off the Porsche pulley.  If I end up with higher oil
temps, I'll run a remote oil cooler instead.  If someone wants this pulley
and nut, it's going to be for sale soon because my 40IDF throttle stops
arrived while I was gone (from a place in California nonetheless - I had
ordered them April 25th from a place in New York) but I'll probably end up
ebaying it and turning this 1600DP back to a stocker (or more than likely a
SQP with 34ICT's and ratio rockers.)

 Another factor that I should mention is that the weather never was over 90
degrees the whole time I drove and I spent a considerable amount of time
driving in the cooler evening hours in unseasonably cool conditions.  This
was the first trip I've ever taken where overcast skies and heavy rain was
very welcome due to the cooler air it brought.  It seemed that I never had a
strong headwind for any more than 30 miles (thank God!!!) and most of my
traveling was done in crosswinds and tailwinds.  I know the trip home would
have been long and at max. temps if I had had a headwind.  I would have had
to have driven 40mph in 3rd gear for a long ways.


 With that, I'll conclude this message and start on part 2.
