   Just got back from Rex Rogers with my newest toy, gotta think of a
name for this one, maybe the Mango Ninja. This bus was originally from
Japan. Don't know how it ended up in Texas but I'm glad it did. Rex knows
the history of it better than me. He's got a great place on 19 acres,
kinda like a bus farm complete with special goats to make those mohair
headliners :), makes me want to get out of the city. Got to see his movie
star bus in person ( the 59 kombi )  And the awesome 23 window tucked
away neatly in the barn, the semaphored single cab, and half of a panel
campulator thing, and of couse the 60 Japanese Standard. He's one of the
nicest bus folks I've met. 
   I guess I'm gonna figure out what all this bus needs in the next few
days. Safari windows for sure, either OG or CE.  High hinge forward cargo
door,an engine might be nice too :)  oh well, guess I'll go fiddle with
the new toy :)
