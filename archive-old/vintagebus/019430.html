I'm fairly sure that there are two different tank styles.  Not separate from the walk through/bench differences.  One is like you have and the other is a threaded top that accepts a threaded cap.  I've never seen originals.  What year is your Westy?

&gt;Has anybody ever found just the cap for sale?  I've only seen one once at a
&gt;swap, and it was attached to a complete interior that the guy would not
&gt;separate.  I figure these are hard to come by, so I've tried to think of what
&gt;I could use instead.  One is to just shove a cork down it.  The other is a
&gt;little fancier and might even look nice -- you know those corks w/handles like
&gt;for fancy wine bottles?  I don't know the name.  But I figured that would work
&gt;and would even look like something you'd put on there.  Kinda.


Your tank must differ from mine.  The fill for mine is quite like a gas
tank fill.  The cap has two lugs.  In fact, the current cap is a chrome gas
cap with a tiny hole drilled in the center for a vent.  Came with the bus
when I bought it 15+ years back.  It's functional but doesn't look right.
