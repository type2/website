It's looking brighter day by day that Rob and Justin Laffoon and I, NQ, will
be able to make the trip to California this June in Rob's 1966 Single Cab.
We spent an 11hour 15minute straight day today prepping his SC (he drove
down 100 miles from Omaha) today and we still didn't get everything done
that we wanted to but we got a good start.

Our plan is to stay with VintagVW listee Don Boneau who has repeatedly
offered us a place to stay over the past year or 2 and has helped countless
others get their Gene Berg temperature dipstick senders at a good price.  My
goals are to do the 4 day show circuit starting with the the Thursday night
thing at Dairy Queen, then whatever is Friday (OCTO?), and then the Classic
or whatever else goes on that weekend.  We plan on leaving around June 1st
or so, budgeting about 4 days to make it to the coast and likewise for the
return trip.  All in all, we'll have 8 days in budgeted driving time, 4 days
for the show stuff, and about 3 to 5 days for other stuff in between.  I've
got a good friend in San Diego I'd like to meet up with (haven't seen him in
6 years) and I'd love the chance to meet some Southern Cali listees of which
Thom Fitzpatrick is one.

Rick Taylor of the famed Taylor Bus Farm around Berryton, KS mentioned
wanting to go and it's our firm hope and desire that he's able to make the
trip.  If not, we'll be cramped in Rob's bus but I think we would make it
okay.  It would just make for some really long days sitting hip to hip like
that. :-)

The plans Rob and I layed out is that we will head for J.P. Henricks
territory in Albequerque, N.M.  This is do-able in about 16 to 20 hours so
it's doubtful that we'll knock this off in one day.  From there it'll be on
to Phoenix where Kyle (Westfailer), Jim Ellis, and the rest of the Phoenix
crew are from, and then to Lake Havasu to meet up with Ronnie, Lou, John and
the gang.  From there we hope to make Southern Cali in Oceanside to Don
Boneau's place.

We would very much like to caravan with the desert southwest contingent but
if we find that the nostalgia and the vintage scene requires tolerating a
25h.p. barndoor's top speed, we may choose to move on ahead as we do have
jobs, remnants of what you would call a life, and responsibilties that
necessitate somewhat of a schedule.

Now's time time to iron this all out as June 1st is only 60 days away the
ball needs to get rolling.

TTYL!

NQ
