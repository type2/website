Subject: Re: Dual Carbs need Help

Hi Eric,

Did you set the throttle plate gaps at idle?
On my old pre FI Alfas, a length of garden hose worked as a 
technologically crude albeit effective synch tool.
You take the air filters off, then do the idle screw procedure as you 
described, then stick one end of the garden hose slightly into the very 
top of the throttle body. The other end goes into... your ear. Listen 
carefully to both carbs. One will sound louder. The loud one has a 
throttle plate that is open wider than the quieter carb. Loosen the 
throttle shaft adjustment screw (engine off), snug down the throttle 
plate a bit, restart and repeat until they sound the same. This will be 
your starting point. Now you can twiddle the fuel mix screws until it 
sounds happy or your tool indicates balance.
Also, be sure to check that both carbs are jetted the same. Even on new 
ones they can be different (btdt).
Also, what sort of synch tool do you have? I used to have the floating 
ball kind for my old jag saloon but afaik, they only work on the 
constant velocity carbs, like SU's, Bings, and Strombergs.

HTH,
Andres
