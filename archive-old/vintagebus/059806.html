Body men get anywhere from $20 to $40 an hour. Unless its a big area, it
shouldn't take more than 3 hours.

However, anyone that is &quot;really&quot; good doesn't have to travel to a persons
home to get work. If you want it done right, ask around to find a good shop
and get your bus towed up there.

&gt; driveable, so how much do you think one of these outlaws should get for
&gt; coming out to finish this for me?  As of right now, I know of noone I
&gt; can think of to do it, so it will probably be a friend of a friend type
&gt; deal.
