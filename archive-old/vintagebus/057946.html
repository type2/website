Subject: Re: [VB] Cruise control in a splittie! (long)

How about the low tech notched stick with 4 or 5 different &quot;speed notches&quot; in it?  Seems I remember someone out there long ago doing it.  One end on the accel. pedal and the other appropriate notch on the parcel tray.  Not really the safest thing, but neither are our busses ;-)

&gt; Well gang,  I'm almost done fitting a cruise control unit to my 64 delux!
&gt; I had always thought about doing it, and looked at the kits that are offered at the autoparts stores, but never took the step of trying it until I read Donald Gibbons page listed at type2_dot_com.    Seeing that he had sucessfully installed it into a 75 Bay window with FI (not sure if he has the 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0), I figured, I've been doing enough out of state driving, that I could benefit from something like this.
&gt;
&gt; The module itself has over a half dozen little switches that are used to 'program' the unit to fit a specific vehicle, and that has taken a lot of trial and error to get it to work right on my litte 1600DP.   Also, figuring how to get the module hooked up to pull the accelerator cable and all that took a while with some trail and error action going on there too.  But a test drive this morning, has shown me that i've finally got it working, and boy is it sweet!  It's actually freaky having it kick in the first time, like the bus has a mind of it's own, and powers forward!  Weird.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the only glitch I've run into now, is the spring on the carb is too stiff.  The cruise module can only pull so much (I think it used manifold vacuum), so if I hit an uphill grade, the unit will kick off, as soon as it can't pull the throttle anymore.  I pulled the cable by hand, and it is suprisingly tough.  I have an idea for it, and i'll get to work on that later this morning to see if it works.  Trick is, I have to find a spring setup, that is soft enough that allows the unit to pull me to full throttle, but stiff enough to pull the throttle back closed for idle.  The gears in the head are spinnin........
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the unit is the $100 item from PepBoys, made by Audiovox, model CCS-100.  It's pretty neat, and easy to use.  and it has three different way to turn itself off!  the two obvious ones are, to hit the off button on the dash, and to press the brake, but it also will turn itself off if you press the clutch in (senses the rpms going up) and I tested it this morning, and it works great.
&gt;
&gt; so anyway, after I get this throttle return spring figured out, i'll put up a page on my website showing where and how I mounted everything, what mods I had to make, and what settings I have the module set on for anyone that wants to install something like this in thier bus.  The instuctions that come with it are good for hooking up the electircal jank, but I think a lot of time and frustration could be saved for anyone that installs it on thier bus, seeing how someone has already done it.  A LOT of trial and error to get this stuff working.  So far, I've only had to drill one small hole in the carbs throttle arm, and that's all.  Even for the dash module, no drilling!
