Subject: confused about timing
Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 05:11:20 GMT

I just replaced my engine after my oil pressure dropped to near nothing on 
the highway and started running rough.
  I re-torqued the heads, replaced the distributer w/a Bosch .009, and gave 
a general tune-up to a 'F' series case engine (a '65 bug I believe).  The 
Muir says TDC is 10 degrees after the notch.  Am I supposed to adjust timing 
to TDC or to the notch on the crank pulley?  I have it adjusted to the notch 
right now, and it hesitates when I try to accelerate at first.  After I get 
going it accelerates fine except when I shift.  Is this a timing problem or 
is there something else I need to look at?  Thanks and Happy driving--Chet
