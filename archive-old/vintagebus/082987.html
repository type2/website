Subject: Re: [VB] Top Speed

I had 1600 single port engine set up with a 28pict. and Craig is correct for 
that scenario. 65 with 70 burst on the downhills.  If you bump up to a dual 
port with larger carburation like I did, and you can do 70 without any 
problem with bursts up to 75 or 80 (whoohoo!).

Chris
&gt; I am road worthy.  I was reading that the top speed of the bus is 60 miles
&gt; and hour?  Is this correct with a 1600 engine?  I need to rebuild the 
&gt; engine
