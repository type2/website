&gt; &gt;&gt;They do a pretty good job keeping the fuzz off my back for illegal head
&gt;lights.  Been running H-4's for the past couple of years (these are some kick
&gt;ass head lights), the eyebrows stop a lot of the brightness on the front of
&gt;the bus.

I've had H4's since 1974, no trouble ever with John Law...traveled in 43
states and two provinces.

Halogen is definitely the way to go, but you had better install a relay if
you get the 100 Watt lamps...my headlight switch is now a toggle taped to
the e-brake lever -- I'll have to fix that one of these days.
