doesn't seem to put out any juice (funny, worked before the

I dont bother with polarizing anymore. And you shouldn't either. 
Why?
You should get a lifetime gen or alt whatever you need. They work or they go

gen, starter, dist cap, has been following my busses for years. Look in the
archives, I must be there. 
Replace as needed for new FOREVER.
