Subject: Re: [VB] rims

............
&gt; 15&quot; wheels came on buses through 63, except 63 1 tons, and in early 64,
&gt; .......   Sometimes you see 15&quot; bus rims at swaps, they  have the
&gt; larger 'rectangular' slots in them.   bus 15&quot;s are wider than  bug 15&quot;s.
&gt; oh, larger wheels effectively increase the gearing.  And the 15&quot;s look
&gt; cooler.  As the 14&quot;s were used 64-70, there are tons more around, and  15&quot;s
&gt; end up 
&gt; being harder to find, thus cost more.

I thought 15&quot; bus rims were wider to, but according to Thom's site, 15&quot; bus
rims were 4.5&quot; w. &amp; 14&quot; rims went to 5&quot; w.????

I have bought decent 15&quot; bus rims for as low as $5-10 each at junk yards,
swaps, but they usually need more hubcap clips.

Clara, what size  rims came on 63 1 tons?

I agree that the 15's look cooler- I know volks that run them on their
64-67's just because they like the way they look.  I hadn't thought about
the gearing difference-how does that work?

I had a good set of 15's w/ decent tires/all the clips on them for sale at
several swaps, &amp; couldn't get $30/each for them-still got them-you can never
have to many wheels-wheels are good!

Tom Buese-the tire/wheel thread is being beat to death on both type 2 sites
&amp; yet I still have questions, learn sumtin new each time.
