Subject: Hockey stick prob solved
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Thanks to Ronnie, Kyle, Bill Kapatch and others for
setting the situation straight.
What the mechanic did was to install a TypeI/III piece
instead of the TypeII. Both pieces look very similar
as previously described as the extremely lazy W
between the main shaft and the ball end. No straight
&quot;L&quot; was involved in this one.
The difference is that as both hockey sticks are
laying on the hypothetical work bench, the TypeI/III
hky stick will make contact with the bench surface
from one end to the other. The TypeII will lay
completely on the bench excepting about 1/2&quot; from the
very ball end. There is about a 20-30 degree angle
between bench and hky stick at that point. It's all
about the angle of the dangle as some might say...
Various work arounds might be developed in order to
make the wrong one work but excessive wear in the
selector shafts will eventually develop according to
Bill Kapatch. It was also inferred that the wrong one
will never quite work as it should. Binding, weird
shift pattern offset and troublesome shifting could
occur.
Thanks to all who helped. The shop who did the work
were great and stood right up to the dreaded &quot;come
back&quot; without a peep or a penny more. Hopes are that I
can now shut-up and drive it for awhile without a
public problem du jour. =)
