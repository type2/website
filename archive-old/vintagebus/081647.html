Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

Hmmmm, if I'm thinking correctly, my 59 had the two metal strips up
front and the press board strips between the larger rear panels.  In
collecting double cab interiors, the early sets seam to come with a pair
of each and the later set that I have has the two sets (i.e. 4) of the
press board strips.

More thoughts?

In addition the DCs came with strips of the same material as the
headliner as the trim strips between the panels, 4 strips in total, 

the SCs came with metal (painted grey) triim strips between the 2 front
panels and the rear panel.
