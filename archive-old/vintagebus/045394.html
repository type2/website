 Did the factory make a Double Door (sets of doors on both sides of the bus) 
23
 Window?
 
 or just in someone's hack dream?
 
  &gt;&gt;
haven't actually seen a real one, but surely they made them.   I have seen a 
couple real double slider 21 window deluxes.

I know someone who is making a hack dream 23 window DD.   I think he regrets 
putting a 23 on the top of his school bus.
