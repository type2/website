&gt; The saga is at end, or nearly so.
&gt; By far Texans ordered big...but I guess that's common knowledge.
&gt; Must be lots of info hungry types out there!  (or just very smart :)
&gt; Anyway...for those who have sent payments within the past few days...there
&gt; are still 15 to 18 copies of the manual left so don't get worried.  All
&gt; orders will be filled....
&gt; But this announcement is to let you all know that these are the last to go
&gt; and I will sell till they are gone and make an announcement in a couple of
&gt; days to verify their end!
&gt; Thanks to all who followed thru with their committment to get one or both
&gt; manuals that I had printed up.
&gt; It has gone pretty well, for the most part.
&gt; Seems as tho a couple of manuals have been delivered in beat up and
&gt; tattered condition ...

Hi Steve

It must be a common problem, the package being beat up. All mine have
arrived, and the top has been torn open, but seems to be intact. And I really
do like the product! Lot's of good information!

Thanks again, Steve,
