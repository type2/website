Jay,
regarding splits (and I live in Northern Illinois) it's like they say about
Harley's...
If I have to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand.
sounds to me like you should get the Vanagon.
John :-)

Subject: [VB] Split window driveablity


&gt; Is a split window bus a reliable daily driver...say between about 1963 -
&gt; 1967? I have a chance to buy a 1981 deluxe camper ($2000) that needs a
&gt; tranny ($1500 new w/clutch if needed), and I like it but what I really
want
&gt; is a split window camper. However, I live in Wisconsin and would I be
&gt; happier with the later model bus in the long run (it has a working gas
&gt; heater)? I hope this email does not annoy the other listees and is an
&gt; appropriate post. I guess I want to hear the selling points of the split
&gt; window vs. anything later and why you drive a split. Finally, would it
make
&gt; the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
&gt; split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).
