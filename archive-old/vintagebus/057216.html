Subject: Re: [VB] Check out this custom bus!!!

I used to live in Wilmington NC, then moved North to
New Bern NC.  I drove past this bus every couple
weeks, and it does look pretty sweet.  Sad to say, it
is quite a let down up close.  The body work is older,
filler cracking out and paint flaking.  The interior
wis as described below, almost non-existant.  It is my
favorite billboard though.  Definatley catches your
attention.

&gt; Hey Scott,
&gt; I didn't have time to ask the owner many questions
&gt; about it. I have no specks on the engine. My guess
&gt; would be a good usable  1600 beetle engine. I can't
&gt; say. The interior was a let down. It had 2 raged out
&gt; dune buggie racing seats in the front. The dash was
&gt; present but not repainted. It had its origional
&gt; white
&gt; paint which was yellowed and speckled with surface
&gt; rust. The top of the doors were left open. There was
&gt; a
&gt; rug on the floor in the back. No back seats. My
&gt; guess
&gt; is that this was used mainly for a bill board that
&gt; had
&gt; the capibility of moving on its own. It was probably
&gt; driven on the ocassional sunnyday or durring
&gt; parrades
&gt; and things. Yes, this was located in Jacksonville,
&gt; NC
&gt; at a small motorcycle/dirt bike/ scooter shop. If
&gt; nothing else, it makes a very effective
&gt; advertisement
&gt; in its retirement.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; Hurray!  finally.
&gt; &gt; You know I *almost* found it on my own.  When I
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; doing a search, I used kelly
&gt; &gt; by itself and got the picture of the dog.  Woops,
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; bus here, oh well.  Next
&gt; &gt; time I guess I'll dig a little deeper.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now on to the bus,
&gt; &gt; Can you provide any info on it?
&gt; &gt; Did they keep the engine stock?
&gt; &gt; What's the interior like?
&gt; &gt; Looks like they removed the windows, did they
&gt; finish
&gt; &gt; the tops of the doors or
&gt; &gt; leave them open?
&gt; &gt; BTW, Its kind of fun driving the bus without the
&gt; &gt; windows in place.  I did that
&gt; &gt; for a while when I got my DC back on the road for
&gt; &gt; the first time.  My daughter
&gt; &gt; and I were coming home one saturday and her long
&gt; &gt; blonde hair was flying out the
&gt; &gt; bus, we had a good laugh as people drove by
&gt; pointing
&gt; &gt; and joining us in the
&gt; &gt; laughter.
&gt; &gt; I'm guessing this thing is located in Jacksonville
&gt; &gt; NC?
