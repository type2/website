Congratulations on your new bus!!

speed limiter for 1200motor
[LEFT ALIGN] KA 211 GREY  449127

KA is the port it was sent to - Kanada at port A (Alberta?)
211 is the model- panel van
grey- it was grey
449127- vin  (would have come with a 36hp motor and split case trans)

there is a NEATO chapter in Alberta- why not get in touch with some of those 
folks
Do change the oil, and I recommmend flushing the brake fluid as well.

   The Mary on the dash is a good sign!!!

the noise in neutral, does it change when you step on the clutch?  likely is 
the throw out bearing.
