Greetings to all Bus People!

I realize the subject for this posting is not necessarily Split Windishield
Vintage, but nevertheless, it is a Bus.

Does anyone know about these things?  I've stumbled across this '77 model.
The guy has had it for a number of years. It has the 2.0 liter engine.   It
has the high (fixed) fiberglass roof.  It has all the camping gear and he
&quot;says&quot; it all works.  He said it has a propane heater (I'm thinking it may
be a gas heater.) and also has air conditioning (no compressor).

I haven't seen it, but he described it as having one spot of rust through on
the right rear corner where the battery is.  The rest of it is spots of
surface rust.

And one other thing,  IT'S CHEAP!!!

I'm going to check it out sometime today.

So let me know if anyone has any knowledge of such a beast.

Thanks in advance.
