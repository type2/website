Here in WA State there are several restrictions applied to
&quot;Classic/Historic&quot; plate use.
The one restriction that is my favorite to abuse is &quot;Vehicle may only be
used for occasional pleasure driving&quot;.
That pretty much opens it up for driving it all the time!
One thing I do, and others may wish to think about it too, is that I have
photo copies of the actual pages in the DMV outlining the regulations, use
and coverage.  It has saved my ass a couple of times when dealing with the
less informed Polizei.
Had been pulled once and the cop thought that because my VW wasn't a show
car it shouldn't be allowed to have &quot;Classic&quot; plates!  So my car had some
rust, dents, torn upholstery, discolored rims, worn out window seals and
ugly paint!  It still met all the rules they laid out.
