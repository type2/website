Subject: Re: [VB] Fixing broken hubcap clips.

I would highly advise against welding.  I'm sure it's been done before but I
can almost guarantee you'll break clips.  I insisted that I never would -
I'd always be careful but after so many times of popping the cap on and off,
they fatigue and break.  If you must weld, so be it but from personal
experience, I'd much rather have the easy of replacement.
