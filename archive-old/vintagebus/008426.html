Hey VBL persons,

I've taken apart my front wheels to install new
wheel cylinders, and clean things up. and after
looking at the rusty mess I'm thinking I should take
the drums and backing plates in to get them professionally
sanded. there's a place in town that does &quot;shot peening&quot;
for 80.00 an hour; is this appropriate for this type of 
application or would you guys and gals recommend a different
approach? 

Thanks everybody,
