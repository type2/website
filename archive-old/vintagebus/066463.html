Subject: starter problems-verdict is in

well,
i pulled the starter today and took it over to a shop that works on them.
they could tell right away something was wrong with it, a bushing, and the
bendix then the starter itself was pretty fried, so they said it woesn't
worth working on-it should be replaced.

so on monday they will be looking for a 6V starter for me. if they have no
luck-mail order kicks in.

thanks for all the help-without your continued support i never would have
gotten into this mess-as i would have been too scared to do anywork on the
bus ;)

i actually kind of appreciate learning how the hell the starter thing
works-i still don't get it entirely, but i think i understand the principle
anyway.

hopefully it will be running by the end of next week.

oh yeah , i figured a really easy way to remove the starter-without being a
contortionist-the bellows for the heater tube-disconncts rather easily,
providing plenty of room to work.
