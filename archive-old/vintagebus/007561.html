I've referenced the archives, web sites, and old emails and I'm still coming
up at a loss as to how to convert my bus from a 6 volt generator setup to a
single wire alternator setup (Alt. from a bug.)  All my wiring is stock
(except for Frank Hill's solenoid conversion - god rest his soul) in this 66
bus so if anyone can tell me in a step by step procedure what I must do to
convert over (concerning what wires to cut or connect where), then I'll make
a web page with pictures and documentation so that others doing the same
thing will have some kind of reference to go off of.
