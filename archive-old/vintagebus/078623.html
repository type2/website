Subject: Sapphire IV AM/FM

I recently picked up a Mint looking Sapphire IV for my 66 SC, I had been
serching for one since it was apparntly a one year only radio according
to the archives (&lt; Sapphire  &quot;IV&quot; AM/FM was a Bendix only in '66.&gt;)
Anyway I shop tested it and the amplifier portion works but I can not
get it to tune to a station in either AM or FM. Anyway I am looking for
someone that works on these old radios. I read about &quot;Brad Clausen&quot; also
in the archives and tried to visit his old web page (
http://home.att_dot_net/~b-clausen/index.html ), but apparntly he is not
doing this type of work any more. Anyone have any leads to someone else
that does VW radio restoring/repairing?
Thanks for your help in advance,
Shawn
