Subject: Re: [VB] Diminished list activity/Jerome

            ...........
  Now....who is gonna be heading to Jerome??
&gt; I know Sean D., Ronnie, JP, Clara, Ricky and myself will be out
&gt; there....anyone else?

&gt; If anyone is interested, my family and I will be leaving So-Cal real early on
&gt; Thursday morning and making our way to Ricky's place in Flagstaff.  We will be
&gt; planning some community meals for the weekend and picking up the needed
&gt; supplies.  Anyone who is interested let me know, they have been tons of fun at
&gt; the past two Jerome.

    I will be shooting to make the Fu Residence by Thurs. nite(10 hour drive
in the DC from SLC). Count moi in for the caravan to Jerome on Friday &amp;
contributing/helping w/ the meals, etc.

Pax,

Tom Buese
63 DC w/ Carl the Great Pyrenees
