Subject: job done

Hey all...I just thought I'd let you guys know how my redux box job
went...

I ended up getting the old bearing off after a lot of coaxing...
Then I flushed out the redux box and cleaned up any crap in there.  I
put on a new redux box gasket with a bit of sealant and put the 2 halves
back together (small nut redux boxes) I put the bearing back on...and
all associated gaskets and o-rings.  Then the backing plate and parking
brake cable...  I stuck it all back together...put the drum back on...
Then I drained the redux boxes and trans...and went down to the store
and picked up some Sta-Lube GL4... a gallon to be exact.
The whole tranny/redux boxes took about a gallon.
Then I adjusted the brakes on both sides...put the wheels back on...and
that was done.

In the mean time..i took out the passengers side windshield and cleaned
up the sill...and painted it so it was nice and pretty.
...this was yesterday...I had 2 shows to be to that day..
so in the morning i filled up the trans and what not...and then went to
one of  the shows all dirty just to see who was there..and told them I'd
be back with my other bus... (this was a small get together...more of a
VW picnic here in town) and then I went back home...got some
string...and proceeded to install the windshield by myself.  It worked
out pretty slick.
So...I've been driving it again...woo hoo!

back on the road...thanks to all your help!

Isaiah
