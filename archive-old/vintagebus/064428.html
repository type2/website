Subject: Re: [VB] 40hp heads

I still have a pair of rebuilt OG # 373 40 H heads.
These are cc'd, powdercoated black, and ported
exhaust for stock or mild cam application.
New guides, springs, shims, seals, and valves
( stainless optional) .These parts alone cost more than jdd
paid for new heads. I have the case powdercoated as well.
Does anybody know the horsepower output of a 40 H engine ? :)
( I am thinking of using it as a starter for a  911 conversion engine :)

&gt; Is the 373 really so much better than the 371F?
&gt; I'm rebuilding a 1963 40hp. The heads I have are the 371F kind. One looks
great,
&gt; the other is missing some cooling fins, and I can't convince myself to use
it.
&gt; Should I be asking the swappers on the list to go through their parts
&gt; collections for one decent 371F or for a pair of decent 373 heads to sell
me?
