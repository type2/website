I saw this..it is a real shame these folks cannot get their facts
correct. Here is a quick short history of VW...find a book called &quot;Small
Wonder&quot; It is the History of VW...real long slow reading but it has all
of the facts....been outta print for a while but well worth finding... 

Welllll....This TV newspiece, states VW, a private company benefited
from slave labor.  

Not true...VW under the Nazis, NOT a private company but a company owned
and run by the Nazi Party benefited from slave labor. This is not the
same VW company in existence today...read on...  During the war the VW
plant was demolished by bombing raids...after the war nothing was left
of any form of the NAZI run VW...no management nothing...remeber they
were all Nazis, they were either dead, in hiding or on trial.  

After the war the plant was in ruins and only a some workers remained
since they had no place to go...As the Allied forces took over..the
British were given rein over the now near demolished VW Plant.  In fact,
the VW company we know today was started by the ENGLISH!!!  YES THE
ENGLISH...as I said they took over the demolished plant and started
building crude KDF cars out of left over parts...they used these for
transport only, they had no intentions of initially staring a car
company....the car was received by everyone quite well...The English saw
this as a great opportunity to help out the out of work and food German
workers....Long story short the English controlled the plant until late
`47 when the decided to turn the Plant back over to the German
people....They put Heinz Nordoff ( a German think he worked for Opel
initially) in charge...and the rest is history.

So as one can see the VW company of today really has no direct
connection to the Nazi Run KDF plant...My post is a very very short and
crude explanation of what the Book small wonder does in 350+ pages. 
Check it out for the real truth..

&gt; Is anybody watching Dateline  (it's 10pm out here)...or for you East
&gt; coast'rs out there, saw the piece they did on forced labor in German
&gt; companies durring WW2?  VW was a major user of slave/forced labor
&gt; durring the war!
