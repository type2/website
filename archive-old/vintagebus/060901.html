&gt; 
&gt; All US spec imported cars had overiders. It was the
&gt; law from what I understand. There are plenty of
&gt; people
&gt; who do not understand what restored means as well as
&gt; unmolested or original! Just look at the classifieds
&gt; on the samba. I have seen &quot;restored&quot; vehicles that
&gt; are
&gt; missing major pieces!

&gt; &gt; What is the deal with overriders on DC's and SC's?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've seen pictures of &quot;unrestored&quot; and &quot;original&quot;
&gt; &gt; trucks, some have
&gt; &gt; overriders front and back, some have them on front
&gt; &gt; and not on back, etc,
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Were they originally sold with an overrider as an
&gt; &gt; option?
