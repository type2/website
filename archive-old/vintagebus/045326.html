Wow- was that the one that was root beer bown and then got the wheel wells 
replaced and was later (by NO) sponge painted green/white?    How is the 
interior paneling holding up?  I was so proud of the warm shiny glow in 
there.   It was called nugget at one time, if we are thinking about the same 
bus... or do you mean the purple /green one that Steve got from me?   That 
must be the one, he said something about a tranny noise.  the one that had 
been sitting in Oly for years withthe 76/77 Evergreen parking sticker on 
threar window- I thought that was the classicest.   Would love to see it 
driving.

yes horns are that loud if you have a 12V bus with a 6V horn!! I think it is 
great.

 Question:  What is Clara's last name?   Is it Williams?  If so, I have yer
 old bus!
 
 This particular '66 walkthrough Westy is a bit rough here and there....and
 there's a monster what howls like a cross between a banshee and police siren
 living somewhere in the back....it doesn't like to go over thirty mph....
 
 The motor feels great...and tonight was the first time I have ever felt a
 dipstick &quot;just warm&quot; after an hour of serious driving.
 
 After a few moments of unsteadiness, I got my splitty legs back, and I was
 just so stoked that I could honk the horn...which I did....are those things
 supposed to be that loud inside?!
 
 What is the best way to remove house paint from a bus without damaging
 potentially good layers underneath?
 
 Look for a picture or two on the VintageBus gallery site.....
 
 Later!  Gene
 
 p.s.  We're thinking the bus's name might be Clara...(it was
 Nugget....that'll be her middle name?!?)
