Hi list, I need some info,:

Are the drive train in split buses the same as pre 67 beetles? and, what is 
the best way to paint a motor, ie, so it wont fade quickly due to heat, ect. 
is powder coating a good solution? ($$$ is outta the picture, I just want to 
see what my options are) (I'm painting a 1500cc engine)

well, generally these days people put 1600 motors in splitties and 67 and 
earlier beetles.   These VWs came with 1500s, 1300s, 40hp, bastard 40hp, 
36hp, or even 25hp motors originally, but usually the 1600 is installed on 
daily drivers, with the occasional 1641/1776 etc spinkled in.  The later 
cases (from 70s beetles, and newer replacement) are better in terms of dual 
oil relief, larger oil passages, better alloy.     All bolt up the same.   
air cleaner, muffler, carb jetting differences.

What exactly are you planning to do w/ what year VW?

I dont paint cases.   I paint tin semi gloss black.  Powder coated tin would 
be nice, but generally use rattle can.   If your engine gets hot enough to 
mess up the rattle can paint on your tin it's toast anyway.    Intake 
manifold would need high temp paint though.
