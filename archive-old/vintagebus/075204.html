Subject: Volkswagen 1957 -

Some time ago I mentioned that I had a VHS labeled &quot;Volkswagen 1957 thru ...&quot;
[can't remember what year it was. 70 something I think.]  I asked if anyone
ever heard of it.  Any way .. finally got around to watching it.  It was a
compilation of their marketing tapes .. Maybe one for each year .. I watched
several .. then I fell asleep.  Showed the inside of the factory ..
inspections .. painting .. building the engines .. They had a small test area
where they drove the buses and bugs around and around .. up and down hills etc
.. There were also tests done with crash dummies.  Something pretty
interesting to me was they had the technology back in the late 50's early 60's
for airbags .. I thought that was very new.
