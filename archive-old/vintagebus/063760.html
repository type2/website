&gt;&gt;Um.  You're in north Illinois, right?  NWS says Chicago got to
&gt;&gt;90 degrees over the weekend.  90 degrees is not hot.  It hit
&gt;&gt;101 here (Tulsa) on Friday and 97 on Saturday.  Around 70 to 90%
&gt;&gt;humidity to go with those numbers.

It's the humidity, not the heat.  Right!

&gt;&gt; A fully-charged 12 volt car battery will read 12.6 volts with
&gt;&gt;no load.  I'd expect the reading to be just a bit lower with the key
&gt;&gt;on and engine off, especially if the points are closed.  In the
Bentley,
&gt;&gt;VW lists no-load regulating voltages for various 12 volt generators
at
&gt;&gt;13.6-14.5 V and load regulating voltages at 12.8-13.6 V.

I'm getting roughly the same information from an electrical engineer 
where I work.  Will work on getting a VOM on it to see how accurate
everything is.

&gt;&gt;VW called for 28.5 psi at 70 degrees C (160 F) and 2500 RPM on
&gt;&gt;the 1500.  What weight oil are you running?  Are you sure you
&gt;&gt;got the right spring and plunger for the second oil valve?  Are
&gt;&gt;both springs and plungers stock?  You might be able to answer
&gt;&gt;your &quot;did I put in a new oil pump&quot; question by pulling the 
&gt;&gt;crankshaft pulley and oil pump cover - the wear marks on the
&gt;&gt;inside of the oil pump cover should tell you.

I believe I have 10W40 in there now.  I know. I know.  Single weight
only is recommended.  I've been running 20W50 Castrol in my wasserboxer
for 184000 miles and may change the bus to that and check for
improvement in oil pressure.  I have noticed that it starts out OK
(30-40 psi) for the first 10 miles, then drops off as I hit operating
temperature.  Sounds like the dreaded &quot;viscosity breakdown&quot; to me.

Both springs and plungers are stock.  One long spring, one short.  One
grooved plunger, one not grooved.  All are used, however, and I may just
splurge for a new set.  I see Wolfgang Intl has a set.  I went through
my parts stash last night and found a new oil pump, still in bag, which
leads me to think I didn't put a new one in last fall when I rebuilt the
engine.
