&gt;    I'm itchin' to get this new upholstery on my front seats that I bought
&gt;thru Jonn _at_ Wolfsden Imports last summer(!), but before I do, I need to get
&gt;new seat bumpers that mount to the divider.  I'd hate to wreck the new
&gt;threads after it took so long to get around to doing it.  I checked the WCM
&gt;catalog and didn't see 'em listed.  Is there anyone out there that is
&gt;repro'ing these??  If not, does anyone have a set to sell??  Any leads would
&gt;be most appreciated.
