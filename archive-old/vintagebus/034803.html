&lt;&lt; Q: how is the nut held in? spot welded or stuck in a square channel to 
disable it from spinning?&gt;&gt;
Hi Wade,
Pretty sure it was in a nut plate.  Which is a threaded part usually a squre 
nut in a box like cage.  The cage is bigger than the nut so the nut can shift 
alittle side to side, but still lock it from turning.  You can see a form of 
this on the fresh air engine head tin where the heat riser tin seals screw in 
place.

&lt;&lt;Q: whats the best way of going about accessing the nut once i drill out the 
screw?  Have to cut on the square channel in the back? Or perhaps start 
drilling spot welds? &gt;&gt;
Hard to say without knowning where it is on the truck.  You may just have to 
cut out the whole area.  Fix the problem and weld all of it back in place.
