 Speaking of yelling, banging, and strength, I had the most grievous time
 with my rear lug nuts when I went to remove the wheels for powdercoating!  I
 ended up sitting on the ground, one foot holding the 19mm box-end wrench on
 the lug, two hands gripping a heavy carpentry hammer, bashing the other end
 of the wrench with all my strength, whilst trying not to bash the new paint
 off of the wheelwells...I only chipped one spot..(yay!)...and swearing,
 growling, and generally debasing the ancestry of the recalcitrant lugs.
 Good thing I had ear plugs in....Michele said I sounded like I wasn't having
 fun....but I was!

well, you're welcome to come help get fire wood at the clear cut with my 
house, could find you some nice gnarly maple to pound at.  If you are angry 
about something, splitting firewood is great.  Ya, bring the DC too !  :)

but other than that- for removing lug nuts I use an 3/4 &quot;(same as 19mm) 1/2 &quot; 
drive Impact socket, on a short extension, on a Craftsman  2ft flex handle.   
  the extension makes it clear the axle nuts.  SO I stand on it holding the 
rain gutter for balance, if a kick does not un der the bolt.  If that doesn't 
work,   a couple pounds straight onto the head of the lug, then using the 5ft 
pipe as a cheater has worked on buses sitting out in WA 20 years, w/o 
breaking  anything.  Ya, sometimes you have to take the brake shoes off 
before you can tow the bus home.
================================================
No, really....I love reshaping pieces of metal with a
 hammer.  Gotta remember to grind that new sharp lip off my wrench....
 
 Have at you!   Aargh!  _at_$_at_#^*$&amp;*!
 
 And then....ecstatic &quot;yessss!&quot;  when they finally started to turn....
