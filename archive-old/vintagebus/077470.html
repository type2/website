Subject: #2 Re: [VB] Beetle tranny on reduction boxes ?

Actually, you can use the 55-63 drums on the 63 1 ton stub sxles, if you use 
thick washers under the nuts.... you don't get the bigger brakes but you do 
get the higher gearing.

Reason is that I wanta bolt-on upgrade with the best possible ratios in 
the tranny, but retain the original ride height and rear brake setup so 
the bus still looks stock from the outside and underneath.
