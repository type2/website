&gt;Hey there,
&gt;. Anybody know of a good shop in the area I could bring it too for a
&gt;little electrical work (blinkers, I think) and a quick once-over? somebody
out there knows of a local shop
&gt;that's a bit closer. I wanna get at least the electricals in order before
&gt;the trek back home (Austin, TX!!!!); I can deal with the mechanical probs,
&gt;if any.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a bunch,
&gt;jesus v.
&gt;
