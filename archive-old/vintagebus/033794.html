Subject: white top bus question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

On the white top buses, did they use a different kind of paint? My bus has a 
white top and it is really shiny and seems tougher than the rest of the 
paint. It is possible that it was done recently, I was just wondering.
Thanks,
Brian
