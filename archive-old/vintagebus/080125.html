Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

ya, worry... grease is good... your king pics love grease, if they don't get 
grease they will die.   
For example, on my 65 westy some of the zerks would not accept grease when I 
got the poor neglected bus.   With taking some out, and judicious use of 
various tools, I got all but one to accept grease.   But not the last one... and 
well I was going to get to it later... but never did
   A few years later that king pin was worn out.  coincidence?   I don't 
think so.  but mine was old and very crudded up. yours are rebuildt... so they 
should accept the grease.. I don't understand.  
&gt;Spindles are on, everything seems good, very tight....link pins accepted
&gt;grease through the nipples readily, but the king pins are so tight that I
&gt;can't get any grease to go in....should I worry?
