&lt;&lt; That is cool.  No personalized fee either eh? &gt;&gt;

The guy I talked with was a Harley guy.  I just talked motorcycles with him 
and asked if he had any better numbers than what he was going to give me, and 
he volunteered to go back and get me anything with &quot;61&quot; on it.  He came up 
with the DAS series plates.  He was pretty surprised when I showed up the 
next day wanting two more, but was very accommodating.  Not usual for a New 
Mexico MVD employee.  As I mentioned in a former post, I was asked to leave 
my local downtown MVD the day before... (it's a long story...)
