&gt;Also, does anyone have a site where wiring diagrams might be available to
&gt;be used in order to repair old radios?

You might enquire on the Usenet newsgroups sci.electronics.repair or
possibly rec.antiques.radio+phono .  SER is more about fixing it
yourself, but you can probably get some recommended shops.  RAR+P
is a bit more towards older home radios (1900s-1950s) but someone
there may also have a good lead for you. 

www.nostalgiaair_dot_com has many scanned schematics online, but only for 
tube-type radios.  

Finally, some public libraries carry the &quot;Sams Photofact&quot; series of 
schematics for consumer electronics.  Usually they keep them behind
the reference desk; there is an index volume where you can look up
which one you want and they go get it for you.  You can look at it
and take notes or photocopy it - they usually don't check these out.
Try the main branch of the library in your nearest large city.

I don't think Bendix makes radios anymore.  But if you're bored,
their Web site lists their tech support number as 1-800-AIRBRAKE
(1-800-247-2725), M-F 8-6 Eastern, or TBS.TechTeam_at_Honeywell_dot_com .
Good luck!
