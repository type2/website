Oh man, now I'm getting flamed by the Pinto and Pacer freaks. QUIT IT. A
couple of guys were pretty cool and wrote thoughtful interesting viewpoints
on my earlier comments, I replied to a couple, and some other guys were
pretty funny. But some of you guys are way over the top.
Really, in the midwest I don't see many Pintos, Pacers, Gremlins, or Vegas
anymore. Unfortunately, rust (as Neil Young said) never sleeps, and it takes
the undeserving as well as the special. I only used these cars as examples
of the opposite of what I see in the VW Bus. Namely, engineering integrity
and the desire to produce an honest product that serves people's needs. If
your Pinto craps out on the highway and I come along I'll give you a hand,
but you'll get a VW evangalist's sermon along with a ride to the next town.
Besides, once you get a ride in my split, you'll go back for your license
plates and 8-tracks and leave the rest for the rust to claim.
