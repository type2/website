Hi Les, 
From what we understand if one uses 316 SS one could drop it in the ocean for 
a thousand years without any apprieciatable corrosion.

&lt;&lt;And thirdly, is the dimetalic effect a problem here?? Or is it only a 
problem between surfaces that have not been welded??  &gt;&gt;
All we know is that there is a steel to SS wleding wire availible.
