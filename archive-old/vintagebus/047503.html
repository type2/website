&lt;&lt;The guy at the FLVWAPS said something about putting something in
 the spark plug hole and waiting for the piston to come up and stop, then
 making a mark, then turning it back the other way, making a mark, and in
 between is TDC. I'm completely lost, can someone please clarify, taking into
 account I am completely clueless here? &gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
Well you would be better off using a aluminuim degree pulley as a set up tool
for this.  Then turn the engine by hand till you have it at about TDC at #1
cylinder.  If you are not sure that you have it #1 or 3 TDC then check the #1
valves to see if both are closed and the valve lash is there.  Remove the
spark plug wire and spark plug from #1 cylinder.  Then you need to use a
screw driver that is not too long and not too short to insert into the spark
plug hole.  Now for the tricky part you want to keep the screw driver as
horizontal as possible doing this and at the same time not wedging/pinching
it between the piston and the sides of the spark plug hole.  Rotate the
engine a little BTDC &amp; ATDC back and forth until you find where the screw
driver is pushed out the farthest.  This area will be about 4-5 degrees on
the pulley so you have to find the center of this area and Walla Walla
Washington you have #1 TDC!   Eric&amp;Barb
