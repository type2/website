Subject: re 60 westy questions
Message-ID: &lt;f7f0c30c.24abc797_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

was writ:


I just recently bought a 1960 westy, it was exported to France.
My questions are:

1. Since it was in France would the bumpers be the ones with the overriders
or the European blade type?
 - - - - -  -
unless it has 175 on the m code tag, that bus would have the no overrider 
type bumpers.  (later buses have the bumper code incorporated in a big n am 
spec package, bt I dont think so in 60)   i would expect it to be euro.

2. What exactly does the D23 stand for? I am pretty sure it means that the
interior package is a SO 23, but what does the D stand for? Deluxe?
-  - - - -
some version of westy so 23
...................
3. What color is SK 654C?
- - - - - 
special Kolour- think it's SWR/Beige Grey, but not sure offhand.   Check you 
door seams 


Thank you for your help!
