Subject: Re: [VB]   High roog owner alert

Yes, they do.  FOr my westy hatch, the sold me a chunk of it
cut-to-order.  Wouldn't everything else on a highroof be the
same, 'cept the door seals?

Of course there's the cool-factor of being prveleged
enough to call up WCM/WW and say &quot;Hi, I need some rubber
for my high-roof, oh and some wiper blades for my Heb&quot;

&gt; I didn't realize there was a need for a special
&gt; highroof kit. Doesn't WW sell foam core door rubber by
&gt; the foot anyways? WCM should spend more time getting
&gt; the stuff they already sell, a little more accurate.
