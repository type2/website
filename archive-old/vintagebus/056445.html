Subject: Re: [VB] stock restos are easy...My bus, my reply

Hi gang,
Does all of this have a point?  Who gives a &amp;$#%* which one is easiest.

Next is someone going to say &quot;My dad can beat up your dad&quot;?

Get a life . . .

&gt;  &gt;A stock resto is sooo easy.  All you gotta do is do the work, you
already
&gt;  know the
&gt;  &gt;entire project's layout.. Rendering.. Just get a dealer brochure.. There
it
&gt;  &gt;is!!
&gt;
&gt; Funny he should say that, as it's not all in a dealer brochure.  They
don't
&gt; show everything, and the pics are sometimes of diff years or colours.
&gt; Sometimes they made changes and didn't print a new brochure that showed
them,
&gt; or didn't say exactly when a change was made.
&gt;      Parts lists list what is available at the time the list was
published,
&gt; not what each period of bus came with new.  Some stuff you can only tell
by
&gt; looking at loads of buses, figuring what came on what years and what
models
&gt; from eye, and seeing enough to tell what was altered and what not. Dif
years
&gt; or parts of years, models and colours came with different things.  That's
why
&gt; I love unrestored original buses. I think there should be a class for them
in
&gt; shows.
&gt;      Some parts went through changes without changing the part number.  It
&gt; took me years to find a missing taillight for my 53 bus.   The repro early
&gt; lenses for them are cr&amp;p. Seen some codged together early taillights for
sale
&gt; at a show for large price, that guy clamined they were NOS.  haha.  From a
&gt; brochure I would not have been able to tell the difference.  Took longer
to
&gt; find a correct 53/earlier bus driver door handle.  Ya, who's gonna notice
or
&gt; care?  I do.  what are the correct wiper blades and wiper arms like?  What
&gt; sort of grab handle does a 61 have?  When exactly did they change the rear
&gt; bumper? It can be hard to get info on all the details.
&gt;      What about the diff logos on dif year lenses? or installing the
windows
&gt; so the logos are in the right orientation?  Colour of sunvisor?  of
sunroof
&gt; canvas? of headliner materiel?  Try to find the correct headliner for a 64
&gt; turk/BW  standard or deluxe. Which fasteners are painted and which not?
Will
&gt; the real Blue White please stand up?  What did velvet green look like when
&gt; new, and how much variation was there?  So many little things.  It's like
&gt; dancing a complicated choreographed dance, you need to know all the steps
and
&gt; nuances.
&gt;
&gt; But if you do kustom, it's soooo easy.   Free form dancing.   Make it up
&gt; however you want.
&gt;
&gt; I just think people should have a sense of humour about their obsessions.
If
&gt; you are doing a pervertedly stock resto- admit there is something odd
about
&gt; the conservativeness and fascination with the real SWR, or whatever.
People
&gt; may not realise or appreciate the lengths gone through to make it correct-
&gt; may even think it &lt;gasp&gt; boring to do a stock resto.  If you are doing a
wild
&gt; kewl kustom, admit the extremes people go to for 'look at me' can be tacky
&gt; and passe PDQ, and people may think your taste is &lt;shock&gt; atrocious.

&gt;  Sorry, but I completely disagree with you here. Just my point o' view,
but
&gt;  when I see a custom (or Kustom...whatever) all I think is how easy it
must
&gt;  be to do that.....
&gt; . But you don't have to
&gt;  follow any rules. ...
&gt; But choosing to paint a vintage bus Fuscia metallic whatever is
&gt;  MUCH easier than finding the RIGHT shade of Sealing Wax Red. There's a
50s
&gt;  deluxe that I've seen at a bunch of shows that's SUPER bright SWR...they
&gt;  tried it, missed it and it shows. And the basic body work is the same on
&gt;  any bus...just cause you're going to paint it Dove Blue doesn't mean that
&gt;  you don't want it just as straight as the custom guy.
&gt;
&gt;  If you're going BONE stock...you just have to watch the debates online
&gt;  about which logo glass you need, which Kamax bolts you need for the rear
&gt;  apron to realize that it's a HUGE chore to go that way.
