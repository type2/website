Ok i finally took Thom's advice and some other peoples also and gott off my 
A** and registered my own domain. I wasn't sure what i wanted to register but 
with Thom's , Neil's,  Chris and Chad's advice i opted to use metwiz_dot_com
short and simple also easy for Neil to rember (grin). www.metwiz_dot_com leads to 
the bizland pages just as they were last month, i haven't updated yet this 
month. 5of the pages are done but i have a busy weekend coming so it might be 
monday before i get them up. this friday is my 16 wedding anniversary and sat 
is my b-day, plus Neil is visiting this weekend to finish the 58 so can 
return it to Asheville around the 15th when i escape to go to the Thing show
