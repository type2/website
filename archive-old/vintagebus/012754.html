&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; The best thing to do in a nut shell is to look up the tire size for
your year
&gt; bus in your year and type Bentley manual or Official VW manual.
Then take
&gt; this info to a local tire dealer who will work with you, to figure
out what
&gt; size that would convert to in todays radial metric size tires.  Ask
them for
&gt; a stiff sidewall in these new tires (Unless you enjoy getting blown
side to
&gt; side by wind and/or semi-trucks passing you on the highways.) in
either P for
&gt; passenger

IMO, there are no &quot;P-metric&quot; tires that should be put on a bus.
P-metric tires are way too low in capacity.  These tires were designed
for cars that use a much large tire size for vehicles in the bus'
weight range.  185-section tires were put on compact sedans.

Be sure that the actual load capacity (in pounds) is equal to or
greater than the specification for the original tire (usually around
1520 pounds)  The load capacity is the only load measurement that
doesn't change unpredicably with tire size.  Would you believe that a
195/75R14 load range C tire has _less_ capacity than a 185R14
_standard_ load tire?

You want the tallest, narrowest tire you can find, as that was the
shape for which your bus was designed.  Low tires spin the engine too
fast, wide tires cause steering box failures.

&gt; or LT for light truck tires.  Expect to pay about $70.00+ for
&gt; quality that will last 60,000-80,000+ miles instead of the 30,000
mile cheapo
&gt; whimpy tires that are about half the price of quality tires.

I got some nice quality Bridgestones in 185R14, load range D, for
about $55 out the door, so you may not need to go as high as $70.
Firestone dealers carry them.

&lt;more good advice snipped&gt;
