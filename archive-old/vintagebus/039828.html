Subject: HELP!! Problems with F/I engine with Carb Setup!

Hello Lists,

I hope that someone can give me a few suggestions.  I have a F/I engine that 
the previous owner tried to convert to a carb engine.  I have verified that 
the electricals are good but the engine does not start.  I believe I have 
narrowed the problem down to the fuel/carb system.  The current carb is a 
30pict-3.  I believe it has a fuel pressure regulator but don't know 
anything about it and don't know if it is actually working.  I do hear the 
electric pump running with the key on.

My question is what do I need to know and due to set up a fuel injected 
engine to run on a carb?  What kind of fuel regulator do I need and where 
can I find one?  Is there anything I am missing?  What do I set the fuel 
pressure to?

I would appreciate any information anyone might have on this subject.

Thanks
Michael Lynch
