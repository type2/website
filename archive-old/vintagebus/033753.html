Any show that John and I attend that has a Friday camp-out always will have
the famous London Bridge Bullis TACO FEAST, of course that is if someone
else is furnishing food for all, like VTO at Christmas Tree Island on Friday
night.


ronnie   London Bridge Bullis
Buses by the Bridge 2002, always the weekend before Super Bowl.

Somebody said there's no such thing as a free lunch,
but it's not true!  At Busses and Balloons V here in
Albuquerque this October 6th, one of our sponsors,
Foreign Aide, is giving a free lunch w/ a Southwestern
flair to anyone attending the show!

How much better can it get, Balloons, Busses, and free
food?  And if Ronnie and John come from Havasu,
there'll probably be a free taco or two for the
campers Friday night!

Check it out at http://onearth_dot_com/2001show/ and make
your plans to attend.
