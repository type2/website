Subject: Re: [VB] Re: fleetlines / 10 digit serial number/ pic

ya, well, you are probably one of the few international experts on them.   funny enough, I found that most of what I thought about year changes from junk yard observations was pretty accurate, after I found out how to look up things in the old literature...  So trust yourself.   Why not make a  webpage about it and invite other Fleetline owners to share their vin plates/ etc /make a registry? 

here in the USA there were only the basic versions imported, so everything else w/ options is pretty unusual, even panels and trucks after about 63 (due to tariffs)  Bay window trucks &amp; panels are really rare!!!  I've seen more barndoor deluxes  than bay window DD panels.    It's nice to find out about the other versions sold elsewhere.
