Thanx for the feedback on the sightings. my tip is for the trip to dmv, if 
you transfer ownership, and pay registration due, dmv computers do not 
require proof of insurance. i have slipped this through a few times. this 
only works if you are transfering title though. just a tidbit relating to 
importing, title, etc.
got the info from a friend at dmv, kinda sounds like a contradiction in 
terms.
zac
see ya monday
