&gt; He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
&gt; before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
&gt; think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted


Ted,

No need to be a jerk about it.  All you had to do was say no thanks.

It's not like I was going to profit off of the deal; in fact it would have
cost me money.  Nobody would place an order at the Bus Depot simply because
they could donate at the same time; if all they wanted to do was donate they
could do it just as easily at paypal_dot_com without having to buy anything.
And if they did donate it would have cost me 2% of whatever they donated.  I
wasn't going to cry big tears if you declined, but the idea had occurred to
me so I thought I'd mention it. I figured you might pass on it, as I
indicated in the first sentence, but I didn't see any harm in offering. I
certainly didn't expect you to ridicule me simply for offering it.  A simple
no thank you would have sufficed.

Don't bother to pass it on to others for consideration, Ted.  Consider the
offer rescinded.  Sorry I mentioned it.

- Ron
