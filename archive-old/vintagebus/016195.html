&gt; Hey.... I got it... You could do like I seen my dad do with an old B John Deere that
&gt; was in the middle of a swampy wooded area. The trees that had grown around it, &amp; the
&gt; mud made it impossible to get out.... so Dad decided to fully disassemble it, piece
&gt; by piece, then we carried it out by hand:) I was only 12 years old at the time, but
&gt; the memory of draggin the block on my snow sled is burned in my brain.
&gt;  All ya need is a few hand tools, generator, sawsall, and some help... so what if its
&gt; pieces when you get it home... from what Ive seen, Thom gettin pretty handy at puttin
&gt; Splittys together again:)
