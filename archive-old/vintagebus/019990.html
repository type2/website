  I picked up an NOS horn button at the red barn from 
the Aussie with the neck brace (forgot his name) for 
$75. Wife was a little stunned but saw my giddy grin and 
the fact I carried it wrapped in plastic in my pants 
pocket all weekend (taking it out to admire once in a 
while) convinced her it was a worthwhile 
purchase....besides whaddaya think a comparable piece 
for her NB would cost!?!
  So I put it on the DC for the Madera show and it works 
beautifully, no more mashing, just a light touch and 
WWHHHAAAAAAAnnnk!!! &quot;Hang up the phone and drive you 
idiot, this is a fine German antique automobile!!&quot; 
  I could get used to this NOS stuff ;) If any of you 
see me at a show, ask to see my horn button! 
  Now how do I keep this thing looking great in the 115 
degree Fresno summer?
