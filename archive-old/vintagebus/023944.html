Woo wooo!  Is my arse burning!

Although I  talked via p-mail within minutes of the original &quot;Who is
Bob&quot; posts to Michelle (the only person it would seem to me should have
been offended by my statements) who graciously accepted my apology for
being quick tongued and short witted, it seems that I pissed off a lot
of others. My apologies.  

As for my own words... &quot;pissed off&quot;...&quot;hate it that&quot;...&quot;every three
weeks&quot;...I stand firm in my right to hyperbole, as an American and a Bus
Freak, and apologize in advance if my language or writing is neither
touchy-feely, nor precise, and unsuited equally for rainbow gathering
and twelve-step meeting.
