Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

hmmm - well functionally the front most 'join' probably needs something more
rigid than a press board strip because the underlying batten that it joins
across
doesn't extend across the full width of the space beside the heater vent...

Whereas the rear join is spanned completely by the underlying batten?

And yes David the point I was trying to make (obviously clumsily)
is that the passenger's compartment door IS the same piece
(and the same as the rear cargo door on a bus) and that's why you
end up with suicide hingeing on RHD twin cabs.

Could be they did it the way I described in the later DCs, and the two metal/
two masonite way in the earlier ones

 ?

&gt;Hmmmm, if I'm thinking correctly, my 59 had the two metal strips up
&gt;front and the press board strips between the larger rear panels.  In
&gt;collecting double cab interiors, the early sets seam to come with a pair
&gt;of each and the later set that I have has the two sets (i.e. 4) of the
&gt;press board strips.

&gt;More thoughts?
