here is the most expensive but easiest way to do it, if your havin probs...
go to http://users.aol_dot_com/fordmoval/broadway.html   and check it out. You
fill out one of their forms they send you and have it notarized. Send it
back along with 140 dollars and they send you back everything you need to
get a title in your state(they register it and send you back regitration and
title). In Alabama you do not need a title but merely a bill of sale so
thats how they get around it(and thats where there located). I did it and it
worked great. Got the title back in 7 days after I sent for it. Works good
for unknown owners of vehicles

&gt;What is the best way to go about getting a title for my vehicle. I did not
&gt;buy it from the previous owner. I bought it from a tow service who was
&gt;asked to tow it away from a property.
