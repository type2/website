Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Hard/No Starting - Long


&gt; So I installed one
&gt; of the those relays-and have not had the problem
&gt; since.

I haven't had to install &quot;one of those relays&quot; in
quite some time, but if I do, I'm going to put it in
the engine compartment, because then you can start it
with a screwdriver from there.  Actually, I may try to
find one of the old British solenoids that has a
rubber covered button on one end:  makes it real easy.
