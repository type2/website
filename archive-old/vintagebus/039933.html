I have been monitoring the Windshield install thread with great interest 
since it added a couple of tricks I hadn't known and will certainly use next 
time around.  However, anyone care to comment on doing this with a corner 
windows for a 15 or 21 window?  Given the cost of the corners I am loath to 
even try these without some foreknowledge.... hints/thoughts/experiences ?
