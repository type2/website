I came up with a way to make your own roof rack clamps using nothing more
than a 99 cent tile adhesive putty knife, an eyebolt, and some tool dip.
The whole clamp came to under a dollar with my employee discount.  I used a
door hinge and a bench vise to bend the knife part of the putty knife into a
nice radiused curve to fit the drip rail on a bug, then bent the handle 90
degrees.  Since the handle already had a 1/4&quot; hole to hang it with, the eye
bolt went through this hole and the eye end of the bolt went around the
tubing on the roof rack.  It works really well and is dirt cheap.  I spent
about 5 to 6 hours cruising aisles in stores looking for the perfect off the
shelf part to use until I came up with the idea.  I kind of got away from
the roof rack development but I'll get back to it someday...
