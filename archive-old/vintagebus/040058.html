Ric,
I just went through the same thing this morning! We took a medium gauge wire 
(about twice the thickness as bailing wire)and ran it through the tube 
several times (from both sides)... it seemed like years of gunk and dirt 
tried to make a permenant home inside that freak'n tube... then, one the 
wire made it through easily, I took a pair of crimpers, bent the end just a 
little bit wider than the gauge of the wire and put the skinny (the side 
without the &quot;bend&quot;)end through all the way through, from the engine side. 
Then, I grabbed the skinny end with a pair of vice grips, and pulled it 
through. Worked like a charm. The throttle cable went through like butter.
I am sure there are several hundred ways to accomplish what you're trying to 
do... this was just our's.
Hope you get it runnning.

Anyone have some hints when the new one refuses to go in? Have all but about
3 feet with push pull push pull. I am at a standstill and had to come back
to work for a while. I hate busses sometimes. I am desperately trying to get
this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in, all
new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will start.
