Subject: Re: [VB] That plastic sheath on the throttle cable, where does 
  it go?

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; The amount of fuel line from the tank to the engine seems the right amount
&gt; for use as an accelerator tube... so replace the bus's fuel line and put
the old
&gt; stuff on the accelerator cable, and as the gas metal line grommet    :)
&gt;

Are you guys talking about the factory flexible tube that goes between the
tube in the chassis and the tube that goes through the fan shroud?
We've got brand new ones here if so:
