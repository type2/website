A group associated with the Vanagon List traveled from San Francisco to
Ushuaia at the Southernmost tip of S. America.  They departed August 26,
2000 and reached their destination in early February 2001.  Much of their
route was in Argentina.

There is a website at:
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/journeys/caravana/index.html    , with a great deal
of information about their preparations, etc.  There is also an archive of
more or less daily reports from the participants, which include a lot of
information of use to anyone contemplating such a journey.

Even if you aren't going to Tierra del Fuego, the photographs are well worth
your time.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  a friend has proposed driving to Argentina from the US(texas), sometime
next year. another friend says impossible....you'll never make it through
columbia, and there are impossible deserts to cross...

he has an aircooled corvair van, and i have the '65 kombi. we are both
thinking that the vw would be better suited, due to parts being more easily
accesible, but his van's engine might be more durable....anyway i said i
would ask the list...  &lt;&lt;
