&gt; Factory &quot;re-conditioned&quot; cases as they were called ground out a portion of
&gt; the original engine coding and replaced it with another that identified
&gt; this re-conditioned case as such.

I had a 40hp motor that had this.  It was rebuilt by volkswagen.  The engine code
under the generator stand was milled out, and then a new one was stamped in.  They
marked it with an 'X' I believe to signify it was rebuilt...then stamped some new
numbers on it. Makes a helluva time trying to figure out exactly what the engine
is by the code.  throw away your manuals cause they are useless to this.
