Hi Jack,
Actually the master cylinder to use for this is the 1971 and later bus mater
cylinder.  This will fit the 1955-67 bus and you can use a rabbit MC reservoir
or the 1967 only bus MC.  Both of these reservoirs allow refilling the MC
through the floor plate in the bus floor just like stock.  The 1968-70 MC can
not be hooked up directly to any reservoir we know of, so one has to plumb the
remote 1968-70 reservoir some where inside the cab of the bus.  Which means
drilling holes and running lines through the bus.  With the 1971 on MC, other
than the reservoir you need the same adapter plate or one made of at least
1/4&quot; thick metal to space the MC rearward.  Then shorten the adjustable push
rod or make one out of a shorter bolt and a short section of metal brake
line,a brass T-fitting, and about two hours to install the conversion.   Eric
