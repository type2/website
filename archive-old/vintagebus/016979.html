I had one of those truck side view mirrors installed on my bus at one point,
as evidenced by the holes on the drivers side door. 

sorry, but i never actually saw them, just what they did to the door.

I believ that all the side view mirrors were dealer installed, ie the buses
came without side-view mirrors.
