&gt; And old tip I read was to put the damaged book in question in the freezer.
&gt; Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't - I've had about 50 percent
&gt; success either way.

If the books are long since dried out, I'm not sure that 
re-wetting and freezing would help. I do some homework before 
trying.

If the book is still wet, then the freezing method is 
recommended as a good gamble, at least to buy time.  Ice will 
evaporate over time, eliminating most water. Shaking out the 
crystals and vacuuming helps with the remainder: then interleave 
the pages with wax paper. 

Since this is something that libraries have to deal with as part 
of disaster preparedness plans, there are some guidelines on the 
web relating to salvaging wet books. Maybe, there's something 
out there on books that are already dried and stuck together.

For instance, I did a search at Google_dot_com for:
freeze drying books

and got some of these guidelines.  For instance:
http://orpheus.ucsd_dot_edu/preservation/howdry.html
http://www.ncl.ac_dot_uk/bindery/disaster.html#Section 7
http://ublib.buffalo_dot_edu/libraries/units/cts/preservation/manual.html

A lot of these are tedious bureacratic documents, but do a word 
search and maybe you can find something useful. Try different 
searches in Google or other web search engines.
