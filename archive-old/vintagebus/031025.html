Squeaking brakes?  Not on my bus.  According to the receipts I was given 
with the bus, the front brakes were last done on 4-24-89. When was 
asbestos done with in brakes?  All mine ever require is an adjustment 
every so often.  I got in the bus one day last fall and got to the end 
of my block and the pedal went to the floor and had hardly any braking 
power.  I thought I blew a line or wheel cylinder or something.  Turns 
out they just needed to be adjusted!  D'oh!  10 minutes later I had 
great brakes once again...

Slather some grease on that drum!  I bet that will quiet em down 8~) 
Whats that Clara says?  &quot;grease is good&quot;?

ps.  In case you do not know, it is a bad idea to put grease in your 
brake drums.  I'm not responsible for you putting grease on your brakes.
