Driving my 70 westy home from work yesterday it started but seemed to have no 
go.
I drove a few miles and decided that I had to stop and check. 
I put on the timing strobe and everything was fine so I checked the fuel 
system.
There was a hole in the body of the carb facing me!
I found a plug lying on the tin by the fanbelt and put it back in.
What is this hole and can the plug come out again? It had no threads, just 
went in with a push from a screwdriver.

I guess that I will look in the manual and find out, but everything runs 
great now. It used to have a flat spot before reaching cruising and now it 
goes great.
