Unfortunately, that isnt an oil level light, but an oil pressure light.
Not a good sign. If it is a high mileage motor, probably has worn
bearings causing the oil pressure drop. Usually, though, this shows up
first at idle rather than at highway speeds...

Does the light come on when you are starting the bus, and when you shut
it down? If not, then there is a problem with the light/sender circuit
rather than the oil pressure itself. I've see the wire hang loose and
only sometimes ground against something in the engine compartment,
lighting the light in the gauge momentarily....hopefull it is something
like this, maybe the wire groundiing out at a bad spot...because this is
an easier fix...
