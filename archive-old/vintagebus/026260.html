        That's why I send mine to the slowest body shop, as soon as I can, to
get them out of my driveway!!

&gt; Why on Earth do I feel like I'm the only one here who wouldn't want to buy
&gt; a house in a neighborhood where junked cars are happily strewn about the
&gt; residents' yards?  If I spend $200K on a house (I live in CA), I doubt I
&gt; would like it if my neighbor drug home a heap and left it in the front yard
&gt; for all to see.



&gt; I have a 2-car garage and 4 cars.
