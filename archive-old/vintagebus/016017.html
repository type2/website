I question the correctness of this bus being posted as
all 'original' being a westy freak-guru of sorts for
years and years...I went over those pics with a fine
tooth comb...considerable incorrect or molested items
and details...either it is original paint and had a
bunch of detail work done and incorrectly I add...or
it has been redone all together and being pawned off
as original, believe me the mags will post-print
whatever you tell them they don't care.  Had a friend
do his own write up on his `61 westy..the wrote
whatever he wanted...helped him in selling it to the
japanese.

Also that paint just looks too fresh to me...I have
owned several low mileage all original vehicles
anywhere from 11K-40K original miles and even with
spectacular paint they do have a certain &quot;patina&quot; to
them.  That paint looks almost right outta the
gun...if the paint was that nice I can't see why so
much other stuff was detailed.  

Anyhoo...it is a very nice bus!
