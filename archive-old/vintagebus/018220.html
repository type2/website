Subject: Stubborn wing nut- solved!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just wanted to extend a thank you to everyone who
chipped in their pointers on adjusting my clutch
cable.  I didn't even know such a wing nut tool
existed.  Picked one up at the FLAPS and was able to
take the wing nut off so that I could clean up the
threads. Anywhoo, all is good on the '63.  Now if it
would only stop raining...
