I agree with Thom for the most part, ACVW only. I like to see the bays included, they're only one less model &quot;behind the times&quot; than the splits. Can't exclude the '70s Things, Type III's either. How about water cooled and non-VW hauled swap parts in the new, lower parking lot? Reserved spaces for vintage competitors? Some nice buses were excluded while Ch*vy and M*rc*d*s hauled in swap parts and stayed.  

Karl in his '78 Westy and I took the backroads to interstate 5 where we promptly came accross &quot;sprinkler&quot; Nate and his family in his camper. Lined up right behind Clara and Sam, a few cars behind Craig &amp; Rosie in the Park queue. We were across the street from a Pik-a-Part I'd never seen. No time to explore though. 
The DC did well with a fresh engine. Not quite enough power to take Pacheco Pass in 4th, maybe after it breaks in. Noticed the baby Dells have worn shafts and are leaking. Maybe it's back to the '40s or get these re-worked. 

I didn't get into the park with it, so couldn't unload all the tin I have. Somebody inside abandoned a good TIII nose with a free/obo tag on it. My find was a set of Solex 40 PII4's with 2 liter manifolds. These will go on an upright T4 engine I hope to build. Karl spotted a '79 Westy in a field on the way down, so we stopped on the way back. $50 in &quot;running&quot;  condition. Might be an engine donor. 

I posted a pic of the 10 a.m. meeting at Thom's van on www.vintagebus_dot_com, gallery. If anybody wants a pic of the red thin bug that was in the lower parking lot, I can p-mail.
