Hi Jerry,
Eight plus years ago we would have agreed with you!  We got teethed on type 
1s and could tell when hitting that 3,000 RPM range by ear in any of them and 
that the engines just were happier and cooler at that top crusing RPM.  Then 
got our 63 SC and drove it by ear.  Years later got our 60 panel camper 
conversion with 1600 DP in the cargo compartment with rod hanging out the top 
of the case!  Built a big bore 40 HP engine for it and tried to drive on the 
freeway.  Result was 45MPH top speed floored and did not sound to be 
overrevving.  Installed a tach and found it was doing 3,000 RPM in fourth 
gear at 35 MPH and 4,000 RPM at 45 MPH.  So out that tranny went and in went 
another mystery tranny to get us a stock 1960-63 47 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  Tached 
our 63 SC with stock geared tranny and low and behold we were doing 3,800 RPM 
at 55 MPH and it did not sound like it was overrevving!  Plus we could only 
get about 18-19 MPG.  Best guess is that the bus due to it's so straight 
sides to allow the engine noise to be swept away to the rear by the passing 
air especially higher up in third gear (30+ MPH) and in fourth gear, and the 
fact you as a driver are way forward from the engine in comparision to the 
type 1 driver postion helps muffle engine noise inside.  Plus the gas tankl 
and any interior are between you and the engine compartment.  We have had 
alot of fun taching for fifteen minute drives fellow bus oweners buses up 
here to show them the actual RPMs they are doing.  So far all but Clara have 
been way wrong.  So borrow a tach and see!  If you are right on with your ear 
great!  If you are wrong you will know before you run into problems.
