Rockin show...best in the mid-west.  Been hitting this
show since the first one some 11-12 years ago. 
Volkswagen of America puts this show on and it is in
their own parking lot.   They have a great museum with
some spectacular bugs and buses....low mileage
original stuff...just killer my fav!!....they only
open this museum to the public during this show and on
special occasions....worth traveling distances. The
Gene Berg cruise has made it out here (driven from
Cali to Mich!) for like the past 3-4 years.

Good show ;-)
need info email me...
