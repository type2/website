Subject: winter considerations?

It is about time I forward this info to the list. A friend of mine that 
drives a 64 deluxe but is not on the list showed me a neat modification 
he made for the winter months. He took a halogen bulb, mounted it inside 
a short piece of copper plumbing pipe, mounted it to his carb and ran a 
switch from the dash. In cold weather, he goes out and throws the switch 
for about a minute before starting. He claims it really makes a 
difference. One thing is for sure. . .the installation is so tidy, it 
looks like stock.
