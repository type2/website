the threads on my left spindals steering knuckle are damaged. can these be 
fixed by taking it to a machine shop or do i have to go out and buy a rebuilt 
one. Spindals are expensive. so if anyone has any ideas to save me money and 
get my car on the road let me know.

i feel for you.   depening on what is up, find a die that size (what size is 
it?) or athread file.   Is you kingpin good?      my drivers side is bad, and 
yesterday afternoon I put a good used (take that for rebuild costs hahaha)one 
on, there is a lot of little bits in there, lots of cleaning to find the best 
used parts rather than kick down for a rebuildt spindle plus $100 for 
linkpins.  Amazingly my needle bearing were in excellent shpae.  grease is 
good!!!!! grease your spindles.  I do it every 3K myslef.  grease is cheap.  
spindles are a lot more work than greasing.   Now hopefully that annoying 
squeak where the tire has been rubbing for ages will go away. DPOs didn't 
love grease.
