John took the bus off the market to FINISH it. I talked to him on the phone
and at this point NO amount of money could pry the bus from his talented
hands, as he says &quot;wait and see when it's done, then say your piece&quot;.

Ronnie  do=it your way

ps; the latest in John's bus saga is the addition of a BD rear engine lid.
This is being accomplished by sectioning the body over the chassis, raising
the engine deck!

&gt; Relax Ellis,
&gt;&gt;I'm chillin. =)

I have a son who is two years from entering college, a
domain where the concepts of common sense and
appropriate pricing have been ignored for the last 20
years at least. 

&gt;&gt;I'd think that you'd be extremely in tune with
common sense finances by now with kids in the house.
OK whatever...

&gt; As for your comments on &quot;common sense&quot; and
&gt; &quot;appropriate pricing&quot; I think John's $10,000
primered and slammed, deluxe barndoor roofed, double
door panel non-complete project is still more exciting
than other cars in that price range, say a two year
old Ch*vy Cavalier. 

Ellis (chillin) says:
&gt;&gt;I agree whole heartedly. More exciting is one thing.
Forking over real money is another. As a father with a
son two years away from going to College, you can
imagine what the difference would be between paying
for a semester at Harvard and a semester at the local
Community College. Sending the kid to the community
college (with architecture that sorta looks like it
has Ivy on the walls) yet paying the same price as
Harvard would be a bite in the butt. Ivy is cool-who
needs the real educational experience anyway?

And one more note on common sense and appropriate
pricing, If &quot;poor, brow-beaten John&quot; (you're words not
mine) would only have the marketing intelligence of
listing his bus as a &quot;Volkswagen Microbus Replica&quot; he
could probably get 30K for it in it's present
condition.
&gt;&gt;right on, good idea. Once again I'm in total
agreement with your marketing suggestion as an option.
He should try that one. I think that &quot;poor John&quot; YOUR
words, not mine, ought to try it. Let's encourage him
to get $30,000 by trying it. That would be cool, huh?
To suggest, as you did in your last post, that you
can't buy the bus because it is now off of the
internet and that the bus was withdrawn from the
market based on email discussions is not logical. If
you want to buy the thing then go for it. If you can't
then don't suggest that you can but are prevented by
the mythical Vintage Nazis. Spend the ten thou or get
real with pricing.
Trust me, Everyone hopes that vehicles like that sell
for that kind of money. I think it would be cool to
customize it with a P.T. &quot;Barn&quot; em circus paint job
and make it REALLY bitchen! Then add a tent.
