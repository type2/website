I don't even own a bus yet, still looking for my first, but I like the list,
it's been 
helpful to a potential owner in seeing what to look for, etc.  I'm going to
look
into the price of t-shirts and see what I can do to get some $ raised so
this
list can continue.  Ted, have you tried to sell advertising on your
newsletter,
having it sponsored by various vendors, etc., or does that go against
policy?
Seems like a good start.  I'll have a status on T's within a week for
everyone
out there.  I'm thinking logo on the front chest, pic on the back.
