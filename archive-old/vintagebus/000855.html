Hi
I had the engine out of my 67 double cab for a few months to fix the
exhaust.  While it was out, I relocated the battery to the other side, due
to severe rust in the tray.  I used genuine VW cables from a parts Vanagon.
All wires are hooked up correctly, as far as I can tell, with the exception
of the ground that connects to the generator body, which was always missing.
The problem is the generator light is on.  When I connect my test light to
the large generator output (d+?)  I get no light. I am interpreting this to
mean I have no generator output.  My brother suggested the generator brushes
are bad, but why would this happen now?  I have also rapped the regulator,
at another friends' suggestion.  Any other tests I can run to isolate the
problem?


Thanks!
