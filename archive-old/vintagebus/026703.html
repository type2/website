Subject: Headlights?? What Headlights??

I drove my '66 (6 volt) Westy to the store last night, after dark,
everything worked fine... came out with a bag of groceries, started the
bus, and ...no headlights, everything else works, taillights, parking
lights, turn signals, dash lights etc.. but no headlights...they worked
on the way over...what gives? Any ideas?
John
