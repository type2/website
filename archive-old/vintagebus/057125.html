Subject: Re: [VB] Early baywindow childs cot mods

Yeah, Beto, I altered a set of those rods to use in my
SO-42, and now use them in my SO-34, but I only had to
cut and weld the front one.  I just bent the rear one
slightly, and it was usable.  My canvas wasn't fit, so
I bought one for a split from Dawn at PLF (she's now
back in business and will be at Red Barn/Kelley Park),
so I can't answer the second part of your question,
but she could.  Pmail me for her phone number.

JP

&gt; I have an early bay childs cot (3 sided, galvanized
&gt; poles....believe both poles are 56 1/4&quot; long).  I
&gt; hoping to make use of this cot in a splitty, and was
&gt; hoping someone has done this mod before.
&gt; 
&gt; I know the poles would have to be trimmed to 55 1/4&quot;
&gt; and 47&quot; to fit.  My question is in regards to the
&gt; canvas:  Just by looking at the pole lengths, the
&gt; canvas would have to be trimmed on the ends, or
&gt; bunched up at the ends, but how does the width of
&gt; the cot differ from a split cot (pole to pole).  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping the canvas can be used without hanging
&gt; too low between the poles...
