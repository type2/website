&gt; Does anyone know if a wiper motor and set-up from a '60 is the same one 
&gt; as used in a '65?  Or simply, can they be easily interchanged?

Hi Don,
You can check this info through the parts manuals on vintagebus_dot_com.  You 
need a 211 955 111 N which was a one year only wiper motor.  Would be 
interesting to know if the 1966-67 wiper assembly could be fitted into there.
