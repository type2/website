Subject: [T2] 66 Split For Sale


&gt;I mentioned earlier in the month that I acquired a 65-66 split window.  I
did
&gt;some homework and found that this bus was delivered to the Bundespost (post
&gt;office) in Bad Aibling (down by the Alps) There it called home for a record
&gt;30 years and then in 1996 it became a meals on wheels for some peace
groupies
&gt;over here.  It then sat with what I thought was a bad clutch and found to
be
&gt;a spaghetti clutch cable with two strands left.  Anyhow I'm working on
&gt;pictures this weekend and will post more as I find out.  The best part is
&gt;that they stored in the winter since 1975 and has a whopping 50,000
original
&gt;but because of the hills down there hard miles.  More Info e-mail me as it
&gt;hits the paper here in Germany at $1000.00.  I think I'd let the list
people
&gt;have it for about 1000dm or 500 smackers.
&gt;Peace Out
