Subject: Re: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

Hi Jason,
We run the biggest (7&quot; diameter) stock &quot;D&quot; crank pulley, and the Porsche  356 
(and 911?) generator pulley.  Just changing pulley belt length on these  two 
pulleys made a huge difference in RPM ratio.  See:
_http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/060691.html_ 
(http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/060691.html) 
  We finally settled on the smaller belt and with FF tranny have  much better 
oil temp especially when we do the Olympia Wash. to Sacramento  CA. and back 
trip!  Used to have lots of trouble with oil temp on that same  route.
  Go to the type2_dot_com archives and do a search for &quot;Porsche pulley&quot;  for lots 
more info.  Since we keep our RPMs down to 1,500 to 3,000 RPM  and only go 
3,500 RPM for short burst to keep going below 1,500 RPM when  upshifting we do 
not get too many RPMs at the fan to blow it up, as happens  to drag racers on 
occasion.
