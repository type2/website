Subject: relubed clutch pedal assembly prelim report

well i just took it for a spin, went to pick up some concrete...my goodness
what a difference. There is no struggle with my foot in pushing the pedal, i
never knew it could be this good.

one quick question:what is the payload of a '65 kombi. I took about 800 lb's
of concrete the other day, bus handled well, lowered the center of gravity,
felt like I was driving a BMW.
