&gt; I am curious what the rear seat speaker looks like, can you take a Photo?
&gt;
&gt; I can't believe the radio was $60!!

Sure! No problem! I haven't looked back there to make sure it is still there
though, but I'm sure the mounting location should be visible. I could've
read the invoice wrong too. It looked something like this:

(these were the dealer installed accessories)

        radio                                    $59.95
        side step                              $15.00
        rear seat                               $15.00
        speaker
                                                    $89.95

As you see, it is a little tricky. I could've translated it wrong, but that
would mean that a rear seat was an option and only $15 and the speaker was a
freebie? I also found it hard to believe that radio was $59.95! Maybe that
included cutting the dash and wiring and everything?!?!?! Dunno. I will look
tomorrow and see if I can get a pic of the rear speaker though(if there).
Talk to you later!
