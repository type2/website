Subject: Re: [VB] Por-15 and body work etc...

A bit of overkill here. You don't need POR15 &quot;and&quot; epoxy primer. POR15 is a
primer and so is epoxy. If you applied both, then filler-primer, you would
probably have close to 10 mils of primer alone. If you have &quot;too&quot; much paint
on your car, it tends to crack and peel prematurely.

Epoxy is a primer that has very high adhesion and is very hard, therefore,
it sticks to almost anything but doesn't sand very well. Epoxy is actually
designed to apply to bare or sandblasted metal. Epoxy is so hard that, if
you don't apply your filler-primer or top coat within 7 days, you have to
scuff it with sandpaper before spraying.  Filler primer, on the other hand,
is very soft and sands well.

POR15 is formulated to apply over rust, not to bare or sandblasted metal. If
you are going to sandblast, I would put on a &quot;thin&quot; coat of epoxy, then a
sandable primer, sand smooth, do your glide coat, water sand and apply your
top coat.

It doesn't really matter when you apply bondo. Some people say that it is
better to apply it over the epoxy. I don't do that because you end-up
sanding off the epoxy from around the repair. I apply bondo to bare metal
and epoxy over my finished body work.

So anyway, I'm planning on spraying with por-15 then do I use epoxy-primer,
then filler primer, and then paint.  I'll need a bit of putty or bondo on a
couple of spots but very little ... when do I do that - between epoxy-primer
and filler primer? - or between por-15 and epoxy-primer? My bus will never,
ever be a show bus - it's a daily driver - but I'm still gonna do the guide
coat thing and I also have to paint the interior - my dash is very bad.
