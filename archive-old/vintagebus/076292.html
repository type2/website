Subject: Re: [VB] Flipseat westies

&gt; No, flip hatch westies didn't have subfloors.   Only the buses with the
sunroof or double doors both sides.   Small pop top and hatchtop westies
still have the frame reinforcement for the roof... (where the rear interior
light goes) and so they figured the subfloors weren't needed.
&gt;

What was the 'frame reinforcement for the roof.'  I plan on putting a small
pop-top on my 60.  The top is actually from a Canadian conversion company
called Dorper.  The top is very similar to the small pop-top but is, I
think, a little bigger.  I have an extra one of those roof support bows in
my bus - think that'll help.  My bus had roof problems when I got it and
since I redid the roof last summer the repair is virtually invisible ... but
still ... I got the small pop-top all painted and ready to go - just got to
cut the hole and fasten it on - anyway - what was the frame reinforcement?

TIA
