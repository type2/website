Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

&gt;From: &quot;Bryan M ,the volkswagen drivin man in Charlotte NC&quot; &lt;jezzina_at_ctc.=
net&gt;
&gt;FYI ; any photograph that is taken by a person can be copywritten by tha=
t
person Unless the subject or owner of the subject (given that the subject=

is not a copywritten object 1st) in the photograph has not given permissi=
on
to have the photo taken.
&gt;
No, this is 100% wrong.  If I look at a photo in the newspaper of a car
accident scene, did the newspaper get permission from everyone pictured
in order to print that photo?  No.

&gt; A scaned image of a 1962 brochure is not anyones, Unless of course the
rights to it have been bought from Volkswagen. Nor is a scaned picture of=

my bus that I didnt give someone permission to take.
&gt;
I was referring to photos I take with my camera.  Just to clarify, the ma=
jority
of VW literature before the 70s is NOT copyrighted, only the shop and own=
er's
manuals are, i.e. no copyright notice.  No copyright notice before 1974
(approx., I didn't spend the time to go look it up) =3D no copyright.

&gt;If Dave can infringe on VWs copyright by copying a volkswagen poster and=

the putting it on the web to PROMOTE  the sale of his items(a clear voila=
tion
of the copyright law), using a trademark VW emage to make money, then why=

is it wrong for me to use that image, He didnt create that image , he jus=
t
uses it to make money.
&gt;
Actually the poster is probably not copyrighted.  I don't think stealing
an image of the poster is wrong if he scanned it, probably just rude.  If=

he took a photo of the poster, then the photo is his property, no matter
what it depicts.  Now if he takes a photo of something that is copyrighte=
d
or trademarked and then uses that photo to make money, that, of course,
would be a problem.

&gt; As for the samba_dot_com,  The banner ads on it use Trademark VW images, do=
esnt
that constitute &quot;stealing&quot; a copywritten image? Isnt that doing the same
as what i am accused of doing? If not worse because money is being made.
&gt;
Which ones?  If this concerns you, you should contact the advertiser with=

the &quot;stolen&quot; VW images and warn them.
