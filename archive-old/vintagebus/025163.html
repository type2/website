All,
	Maybe I'm just imagining it, but it seems to me that the pre-60's VWs,
Mercedes, even french and english cars that survive today are not as
rusty as those made in the '60s, '70s and so on.  Maybe the steel back
then was less contaminated or more resistant to rusting?  I washed and
waxed the '56 Oval today and I'm still amazed after owning the Beetle
for over 5 years now how rust free it actually is.  It's really never
been properly garaged.  A friend's '56 bus seems the same.  Maybe these
survivors are just strange, lucky, or made of thicker and superior
steel?  I wonder if Ellis somehow feels that this better craftmanship is
somehow personally reflected in his millionth Beetle birth date?!
