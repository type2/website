Subject: RE: [VB] Spring plate covers, spring plate bushes and thanks

&gt; &gt; I have removed my springplate covers and wish to tidy them up, would it
be
&gt; &gt; okay for me to get the rears of them sandblasted, and then for me to
spray
&gt; &gt; them totally with POR15.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, That's what I did with mine years ago.
&gt;
&gt; cal

Did you do anything to your spring plates?  I am thinking about maybe
removing them, using to pieces of wood either side of where the splines are
with a piece of thread-all and nuts holding it together?

Or should I just leave alone?

Thanks
Paul
