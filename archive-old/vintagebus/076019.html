Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

&gt;Stan-
&gt;You obviously have me confused with someone
&gt;who ....would spend two thousand dollars and
&gt;commit much time and effort in resolving new
&gt;defects a second time.

hey, i resemble that remark!  :)

the only reason i got ANOTHER one is because that is all the 
manufacturer would do - replace in kind, NOT refund. RONNIE offered 
to replace it w/ a new 'official' vw case, but it would've come out 
of his OWN pocket, and i didn't want to do that to him. he's been 
great about listening to me scream in his ear and helping me track 
down answers and replacement parts.
