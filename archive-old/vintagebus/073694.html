Subject: Re: [VB] '56 Single Cab

&gt;I haven't seen this one but I saw a mid-sixtys double cab in similar
condition
at a local show in GA that a guy was asking $25,000 for. I think he ended-up
selling it for $18,000. Are mid-sixtys double cabs in more demand that mid-
fiftys single cabs?
&gt;
Yes, Double Cabs are usually more in demand, although I would say a 59-61
DC would be more desirable than a mid-60s DC.

Assuming he actually sold it for that, $18,000 seems VERY high to me.  It
was either perfect or it was an uninformed buyer.

Here's one for $14,500:

I would pay somewhere in that range for a mint '52 Single Cab, assuming
it also had a mint or NOS tilt.  Email me if you have one.  Thanks.
