Subject: Re: [VB] Single Port Head Help!

Hi Roger,
The head you have pictured is an early 40 HP head (pre-1964?) with the round 
boss instead of the later square boss.  You might get it to work if you get 
the repair stud that has a round wedge shaped inner end to keep it from being 
pulled through again.
