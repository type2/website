Subject: oil temp guage readings
Message-ID: &lt;5f470766.248df409_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

just put a temp sender into my  65 westy on Wed.  it is the kind that screws 
into the case replacing a oil pressure relief valve plug.

The guage has been in the bus for a while, awaiting the sender.  Guage is in 
C, which is 100C is 212F, 90C is 194F, 85 C is 186F, 80C is 178 F.   Thinking 
of putting a F one in there, with a better range- this one goes up past 300C, 
which I dont ever think I'll use on a VW .   

So what I find is that the temp gets up to 80C quite quickly, by the time 
I've gone 4 miles.  I have a thermostat installed, so this is what you would 
expect, nice to have it confirmed.

One the freeway for about 10 miles it creeps up to 90C, another 10 miles, 
close to 100C.   AT this point I pulled over to see what the engine felt 
like.   The oil pressure was reading  about 32 psi _at_ 3K rpm.   It was in the 
seventies outside, and I had a chunk of bus on the roof acting like a sail.


at the guage reading 100C the dipstick was holdable, though of course not 
cold.   Spit did not sizzle.   It kinda slowly evaporated.   I am not sure if 
it is exactly accurate this guage, as I omitted to test it in boiling water 
before installed it in the motor, silly me, and pulling it means all the 
fresh oil I put in falling everywhere.   It is a bit tricky inserting it with 
that spring and all, so there would be time for oil to spill.  

Continued for another 50 miles, and it stayed just  a tad under 100C.

Anyway.   that's what it is.  Around town it stays about 85C.   

Had a dipstick oil temp guage on this motor years ago when it was new and in 
the 61, and remeber it reading something cool  a lot on a road trip in the 
summer.  different sender , dont remember exact numbers though. though.

1600 sp dual relief case, doghouse cooler, with about 25K miles on a rebuild.


Clara  

so, being new to thisnumbers thing, is this the sort of readings other people 
are getting?
