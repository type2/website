i have not done this yet...i am a little wary of it myself. But I was
wondering why you can't take your drivers seat apart...at the pivot point of
mine it is just a bolt, no rivet...'65 kombi, maybe earlier buses are
riveted?

2nd question:
my passenger seat does not pivot like the drivers seat. The move it
forward-the whole seat pivots on the front corner. Any idea why they didn't
put the pivot in the passenger seat...has anyone ever tried to modify their
passenger seat to pivot like their driver's seat.

for all of the above i am referring to a 1/3-2/3 setup
