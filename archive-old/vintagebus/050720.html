Subject: Site w/ Vintage Color Charts? Paint type?

Coming down to the wire on figuring out what color to paint my 56 vert.  
Also going to be re-painting this spring my 60 crewcab so I need to figure 
that out too.  I just came back from the auto paint store to figure out what 
paint I was going to use and looked at the color charts.  They had a old 
Glasurit paint book but it was all in german.  I thought there was a site 
that had vintage VW color charts with names.  Anyone know of a site?  I am 
thinking a two tone color for the vert in greens or just a solid green 
pastel color.  Got to be vintage looking.  Any suggestions?

Also, I will be painting the car myself in a rented booth.  I wanted a good 
paint with lots of that &quot;show winning deep shine&quot; and was considering the 
base coat/clear coat system (?).     The lady at the counter talked me into 
using Dupont Chroma Base paint.  Anyone use this?

Thanks much...
