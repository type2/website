Subject: 12 V Gas heater available.

Earlier I had posted this on the VintagVW list but upon further examination,
the heater is a 12v.  Sorry for the misinformation.  I'm taking pix as soon
as I I post this message so you will all be able to see what it looks like.

===============
I just got ahold of a Stewart Warner 12v gas heater and I'd like to offer it
for sale to list members before I put it on ebay.  All the controls and
everything are there (it's complete) but the exhaust pipe has rusted off and
would need to be repaired.  Compared to some gas heaters I've seen, this one
is in better shape.  It hasn't been run in about 20 years but the guy I got
it from swore up and down that according to his father, it worked fine until
the day they got rid of the beetle and pulled the heater because it didn't
go with the deal.

My email address is silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

First come first serve.
