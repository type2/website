Hey Volks,

I'm &quot;almost&quot; to the point where I'll be dipping, neutralizing, and painting
my bumpers for my '66 Westy.  I don't know why I'm even asking this, because
the color I've gone and painted her is not a definable one (at least not
stock), but I guess it is your opinions that count:  If I paint my bumpers
the same white as the above the beltline parts (a close approximation of
Pearl White), will it look stupid?  Should I try to find a match to this
mysterious Silver-White for the bumpers and wheels?  Or should I just spray
on that white POR-15?  (I have a feeling that that would look even more
stupider...)

I just spent many late nights de-rusting and preparing the cargo floor and
sides ....much insulation was added, a vapor barrier, and then new panels.
I replaced the long panel and the cargo door panels because they were rotted
and hole-y, but I had to do the long panel with two peices in order to
preserve the vertical grain......oh well...I must learn to be more patient
and to grow more money.....check out Robert Davis' work on the
vintagebus_dot_com website under the Westy section to see what I wish I'd have
done&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I'll be updating my website with an interior page tonight....it will be:
www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Interior1.htm
Give me an hour from 7:15 Pacific to get it working......

Later,

Gene Cornelius
