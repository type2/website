So would that inflection be TRANsporter or transPORter or transportER?

Funny how the important tech topics trickle in all day with a few responses,
and then a pointless subject like this comes along and everyone has
something to say. I guess since Thom responded, we assume it's &quot;OK&quot; :-)

&gt;
&gt; I think the most common mistake there is referring to single and double
&gt; cabs as Transporters only. Whenever someone says Transporter, with that
&gt; certain inflection in their voice...I usually know that they mean
&gt; truck style.
