Subject: Re: Shift rod coupler off! Hurray! Shiftrod staying put - boo,
  hssss

&gt;
&gt;Do I have to do more drilling to take the set screw out?

When you got the coupler off, the set screw should have come with it.
The original set screw has a pointy end; if you don't see the pointy
end on the screw then it might have broken off down in the shift rod.

&gt;Is the front shift rod a hollow tube, and the middle shift rod slide 
&gt;into the middle?

Yes.  The middle shift rod is solid, or at least has a solid insert
in the end.  It has a little divot for the point of the set screw.
The front shift rod is hollow with a hole for the set screw.  The
middle rod only goes into the front rod about an inch.

One idea is to reassemble the gearshift, without the spring and pin
or the lockout plate, and work the gearshift back and forth.  Gives
you more leverage on the joint.

If nothing is moving it, you might _carefully_ try some heat from a 
propane torch.  Wipe off as much of the penetrating oil as you can
before you do this - the oil may catch on fire.  Have an extinguisher
handy.

Good luck!
