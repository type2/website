Subject: looking to trade for air cleaner

Wondering if anyone had a oil bath air cleaner &amp; metal connection
tubes laying around. I bought an air cleaner that I thought would work
(which it might still) but this was the style of the earlier splits
that mounted on the drivers side of the engine compartment. I need the
one that mounts on the passenger side.

let me know if anyone has one around. Even better would be someone who
needed what I have &amp; wanted to trade (since I'm a cheap bastard).
