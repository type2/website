&lt;&lt; 
 I'm looking at a 1959 Double Cab, and I'm curious as to how practical some
 changes could be.  My goal is to make it daily driver suitable without
 making it impossible to return to stock later.  Yes, I want to make sure my
 changes are mostly bolt-on and can be reversed:
 
   1) Tranny top speed and how practical it would be to swap tranny out with
 higher top speed gears (Todd Hill in Olympia).&gt;&gt;
You should get over 60MPH at 3,000RPM in fourth.  If you use a 1964-67
reduction boxes.  If you do go to the 1964-67 reductions, change the front
beam to a 1964-67 first.  You will end up with a 20% bigger brake system and
it will feel more like 50% bigger.
   &lt;&lt;1a) Redux boxes -- what years are interchangeable?  What would bolt on to
 a '59?&gt;&gt;
1955-67.
   &lt;&lt;2) Anything unusual in putting a 1600DP bug engine in this?  Is it
frowned
 upon to have to enlarge the 6v tranny to accept a 200 flywheel?&gt;&gt;
You can do that or use a 200mm 6volt flywheel and if you are going to use a 12
volt system, just change the solinoid to 12volts on the 6 volt flywheel.  With
the higher voltage in the 6 volt starter you will have less trouble starting
in cold weather.  Also we have walked buses in first gear with this starter
and 12 volt over a block with this setup when the engine died in places that
did not allow one to get out and fix things there.  
   &lt;&lt;3)  Brake parts and other stuff?  What years are of relevance
 (compatible)?&gt;&gt;
1955-63, 1964-67.
  &lt;&lt; 4)  Tail lights, head lights, wire harness, electrical in general.  What
 years would I expect to be compatible?&gt;&gt;
 Tail lights fit the hole you have, headlights will work from 1950-67, as for
wiring harness you need to get your year to avoid wiring headaches.
&lt;&lt; Again -- If I get original stuff (like engine), I intend to store them away
 and take care of them until I can do a full restoration.&gt;&gt;
 That is the way to go since the early bus engines and trannys are quickly
dissappearing, so later if you decide to you can turn it back to show quality
without alot more hunting around.
 &lt;&lt;Anything else I should be thinking of and/or anticipating?  The bus in
 question sat in a junk yard for 20 years, and hasn't been driven for
 decades.  Is a split this old difficult to find &quot;normal parts&quot; to turn  it
 into a daily driver?   &gt;&gt;
Just make sure you go through everything throughly.  As for finding parts to
make it a safer daily driver the 1964-67 parts are out there in buses that are
not restorable.
