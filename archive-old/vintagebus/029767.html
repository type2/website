Subject: Replacing P.O. installed aftermarket oil cooler
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi all,

After reading about the evils of an improperly installed aftermarket oil
cooler
(in front of the fan intake), and having to replace the trans in my '64
(1500cc) soon, I thought it would be a good time to buy a stock oil cooler and
install while I'm at it.

Question:

What do I have to purchase? Is it a straight replacement?

Thanks in advance,

Jeff
