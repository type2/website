Back in the early '90s I had a transaxle rebuilt [super premium custom
rebuild, not an exchange deal] by German Transaxle in Bend OR.  The result
was a disaster, with noise being one of several problems with the gearbox.

Their standard response to complaints [found out later I wasn't alone] was
to insist the lube be replaced with Redline MT90.  Except for costing a lot
of money, the Redline had no perceptible effect on the transaxle's problems.

After they rebuilt/repaired the box a couple of times with no improvement in
the situation I went elsewhere for a gearbox.  The later repairs and
re-rebuilds were filled with Redline MT-90 right out of the box, at German
Transaxle's insistence [and threats of warranty cancellation].

My present transaxle works OK, so I don't feel a need to use anything but
good old 90 weight GL-4.  The bottom line is that if a gearbox is messed up
inside there is no &quot;pourable&quot; miracle cure.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I have used a product made by BG Products out of Kansas. It is a gear
oil
additive, kind of like Lucas oil. I have put this in my RGB and trans and it
did help quiet down the 77 4th gear whine!  &lt;&lt;
