&gt;Oh trusted listees, can any of you tell me about the extra louvers on this
&gt;truck?  http://www.brubakerbox_dot_com/temp/67sc.jpg

The limited info I have says the two sets of louvers should be mutually
exclusive.  The Doliwa book has a page with a picture of a dump-bed pickup
with the later over-wheel vents, and a picture of an earlier regular
pickup with the rear-corner vents (outies).  The change is also noted
in the 1965 list:

---
2 Aug 65  266 000 002  Pickup: Back window enlarged.  Cooling air vents
                       on sides over wheel wells; were in rear side
                       corners.  Treasure chest door with two air vents;
                       was three.

I realize you can't always go by books and lists.  However, if this
truck came from the factory that way, I'd guess that having both
vents would be more likely to happen on an early '66, right after they
made this change.

Since you mentioned that the frame had been sectioned, and since there
is some lower-body rust apparent in the photo, my *guess* would be that
the original rear corners rusted, and were replaced with the earlier
style corners with vents, possibly in the interest of better cooling.
