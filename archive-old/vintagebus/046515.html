I have ordered this great stuff from these people a couple of times, and the 
only way you can get it is to order it from them.  The first time I ordered 
it, they sent it COD, but I guess once was enough to trust me; the second 
time I told them to send it COD and they just sent it and billed me.  Nice 
company and good products.  The Silikroil is my favorite so far.
