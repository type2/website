Subject: 30mm oil pump continued....

Hi!

I just spoke to Clyde Berg, and he says that I will be fine running a 30mm
pump without a pressure relief cover.  He mentioned that the ball in those
covers can clog with the least contamination, and leave important bearings
without proper pressure.  He also said that if I warm up the engine before
revving it to driving speed, I wouldn't have a problem with blowing seals,
etc.  I am now confused....it sounds like he was saying that a 30mm pump for
a dual relief case was fine....

Please...what should I do?

Thanks, Gene
