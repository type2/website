&lt;&lt; I removed my front drivers 
 side shock yesterday in hopes to replace it and I found that the bottom 
shock bushing was completely wedged on to the stud!! The shocks were
 so dead it wasn't even funny so I can only assume that the pounding
 of the bumps caused the stud to get bent by the bushing and as a result the 
bushing won't come off.  Its on there real good, no wd40 helping here no vice 
grips puling,  &gt;&gt;

yes, BTDT.  Found the best way to deal is to get out a grinder (and suitable 
eye and ear and skin protection) and grind a flat spot on the bushing.   do 
not quite grind through into the stud.   then you have purchase for the vise 
grips.    Worked for me.

grease that stud well before puting the new shocks on.   Grease is you 
friend.  If only the DPO had used grease.........
