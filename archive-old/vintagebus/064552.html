&gt; Hmm, I checked all of my books through 77 and couldn't find anything like 
&gt; that. My old 74 and 77 didn't have anything like that, but they sure had 
&gt; all that CA smog stuff, what a mess. Maybe 78/79 ? Or possibly A smog CA 
&gt; model ?

Hi Ray,
Good question!  We have found a forward engine tin for FI bug and the 
acellerator cable passage through this and the Bernoulli ringed shroud match 
up.  Is anyone out there on a bug list that can inquire there and report any 
findings on this shroud?????
