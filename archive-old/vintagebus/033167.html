Subject: Re:  [VB] Wheel rims - what shape are the cutouts?
To: jclark_at_supernet_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


My 65 standard has four rims with smoothly curved cutouts and no spare. 
I have a wheel with cutouts that are more angular -squared off.  Someone
told me those are Type 3 rims.  Yes?  Usable?

  --  --  - -
the 14&quot; bus rims have little small curved utouts.  the 15&quot; bs rims have large 
squared off cutouts.   what are the dates on the rims?   there is also a 
marking as to size on there.
