hello list,

I am thinking about placing another order for some POR-15.

My question is Should I get some of their POR-20 too? (I think that is what 
they call their exhaust paint)   I want to In order to coat my Heater boxes 
and exhaust.  The heater boxes are VW ones so I want them to last a while 
because everyone says the Dansk ones are crudy.

Secondaly
does anyone have a SVDA dizzy that they would part with or know where I 
could get one? I want to see how much of a difference it makes compared to 
my 009.

thanks
domonic
65 Kombi  I
