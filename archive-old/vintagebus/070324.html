Subject: Trailer Mounts

Does anyone, especially Ronnie, have a pic of the mount for their single wheel trailer and even dimensions. I am thinking about getting another rear bumper and having a hitch made for it rather than punching holes in the bumper again.  Secondly, know anyone who could make one?   Sean 65 Westfalia
