Subject: Re: [VB] quick tire question

&gt;&gt; tires, exotic 16-ply specialty tires, etc, what size tires should I get
&gt;for
&gt;&gt; my 15&quot; wheels?  I want to get them tomorrow or the next day in prep for
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; trip to KP.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I run 165-15, which is very close to the stock size. When I bought them (at
&gt;Costco) the guy called them Volkswagen tires.

155SR15 would be right for early 15&quot; Beetle, which came with 5.60-15 tires
(usually Continental).

165SR15 is correct for late (around '73 up) Beetle/Super Beetle, which came
with 6.00-15 (I've seeen Continental and Semperit) and then 165SR15 (late
convertibles had Continental TS771) tires.

15&quot; Split Buses came with 6.40-15 tires, so a 175SR15 should be correct.
These seem like an odd size, but a Michelin XZX 6PR tire was factory on
Volvo wagons sold here in the early 70s.  MIchelin and others must still
make such a tire, but they might not market it in the States any more.
Still, 175SR 15 will be the closest for speedo accuracy, ground clearance,
etc.

14&quot; Split Buses came with 7.00-14 tires, and there is much info on the
website about the correct 185SR14 tire to use.  No need to go into it here.
