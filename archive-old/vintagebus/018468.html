I didn't have much luck with the WW horse hair.  On the '55, I used
a layer of denim glued to the springs, then a layer of this brillo-pad
like stuff, about 3/4&quot; thick, on top of that, then 1&quot; (I think) 
upholstery foam on top of that.  They came out sweet!  When I did the
60, they were out of the brillo stuff, so they sold me this felt padding
instead, which I think works even better. 

It took me about 30 - 45 minutes per seat half, which doesn't include
prep work like removing the old stuff or painting the frames.

&gt; this may be a chickensh*t answer.  i reupholstered the seats in my '67 beetle.  i got burlap sacking stuff, wolfsburg west horsehair pads and tmi seat covers.  i took the seats down to their components - back separated from seat.  i spent a weekend on the project - prolly 10 to 15 hours.  it was a pain in the ass.  my hands were sore and raw from about a week afterward.  having a day job as a librarian does not lend itself to work of this nature.

&gt; two weeks ago i took the seat from my single cab to a local upholstery shop.  for $180 i received a reupholstered seat that is, in my opinion, a work of art.  the professional used the original as a pattern and material that very closely approximates what had been on the seat.  for the older vehicles, he seems to take a &quot;restoration&quot; approach.
