Dan--
I'd be (as well as many others i'm sure) interested in a safari window that 
would be able to be installed in a bus in the midwest or pacific northwest 
without significant water problems. I'm also interested in safari's that 
don't need mods to fit into earlier busses (ie a '59) or have problems from 
the start and look similar to the originals. 
That may be too much to ask, but until then, I'm not even considering a 
safari installation.

It seems as though there is a drawback for every safari out there at this 
point, but, it'd be nice to have a near perfect repro! This definately takes 
a certain kind of person w/ the right skills and cash for production!!! Are 
you thinking about working out a prototype?:)  What about really strong 
stainless steel frames? 

Good Luck!
