A friend of mine just brought a load of VW's back from the South west,
Including a couple split window deluxe's, a panel and a single cab. We
didn't talk alot about them so you'll have to call him for the info. 
 He has others (bugs, buses) available too. 

Call Steve at 724-728-2084 and tell him R.J. sent you.
