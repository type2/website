&gt; Well, it sounds like the &quot;regulars&quot; are falling off.
&gt;  Other than Ronnie, it 
&gt; doesn't sound like I will know anybody else there.
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't heard from Chuck, so I am guessing he may
&gt; not make it either.
&gt; 
&gt; so lets review, not going is Jim Ellis, Beto,
&gt; Ricky(?).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else out?
&gt; 
&gt; Mike (a possible no-show as well)

Mike 

We have been slow to respond to the BBB list of go/no
go's as we are not sure we will be able to go this

We will let you know as the time gets closer.
