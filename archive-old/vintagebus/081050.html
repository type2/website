5. Volumetric thermal expansion.
Let us consider a rectangular bar with sides L1, L2, L3. Then, assuming that
linear expansion is small comparing to these sides, it is easy to show that
V = L1L2L3 + L2L3L1 + L3L1L2 (5)
Using expression 3 for linear expansion, we get
3
V = 3L1L2L3T = 3V0T, (6)
where V0 is an initial volume. Note that this is valid only for
isotropic materials.
More generally:
V = V0T (7)
When a sample is heated, cavities in it expand at the same rate as they were
filled with the material the sample is made of.
Example. A driver pulls into a gas station and says &quot;fill it up&quot;, so the
steel
tank was filled to the very brim with 56 liters of gasoline at 10oC.
The trip home
is a short one, and the heated garage is at 10oC. How much gasoline
will overflow?
g = 950 0- 10-6K-1 and s = 36 0- 10-6K-1
Solution:
Volume of gasoline: V0 = 0.056 m3
The volume of gasoline will increase : Vg = gV0T = 5.32 0- 10-4m3.
However, the volume of the tank will increase as well:
Vtank = sV0T = 0.202 0- 10-4m3.
The dierence Vg - Vtank = 0.51 0- 10-3m3, or 0.51 liter, will overflow.
Finally, we considered that these linear and volumetric expansion laws may
fail near freezing and boiling points due to changes of the internal
structure of
substances (e.g., expansion of water near 0oC.


for the formulas (which didn't copy well!)
