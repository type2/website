&gt;I'm thinking that I need a new clutch. The van accelerates OK but when
&gt;the cam hits its power peak the clutch slips and the engine revs.

When the OG clutch in my Dad's '74 Bug went out in about 1995, it
exhibited the same symptoms.  When we got it apart, the friction
material was fine but the diaphragm springs had lost their springiness.
We replaced both pieces while we had it apart though.

&gt;72 1600+ Engine.  Independent rear suspension with late transmission.

Nit: All air-cooled Volkswagens (with the possible exception of the
Vanagon) have IRS.  You have CV joint axles instead of swing axles.

&gt;I've got no idea of what clutch assembly it might require.

It is _probably_ the same as a 1600 Bug clutch, but you can't tell for
sure until you have it apart.

&gt;Is there a basic instruction on the Type 2 archives for this procedure?

There is http://www.type2_dot_com/library/drivetra/kuhn5.htm in the Library.
When Dad and I changed his clutch, we used the Idiot manual and the
Bentley.
