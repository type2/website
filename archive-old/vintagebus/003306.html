Subject: Visitor and I'm breathing / seeking contact info on Douglas Lloyd 

Hiya folks, Dan Kinsey stopped this morning for a visit and to pick up a set
of belly pans i had fabbed for his Binz. That was the first time up close
and personal with one for me , very cool ride. in actually very good shape,
but could use a little TLC, grin,,. We don't get many jobs that are in as
good of shape as that one is. Actually a few pie jobs after these monster
rustorations and fixing some previous &quot;restorers&quot; handiwork,would be a
welcome site. Dan was a pleasure to chat with and i'm glad to have had the
chance to meet him.
The last 3 months or so have been very fubared around here with the shop
being added and now we are geared up to finish the 66 21 and Kent's 56 this
month, so we should have a good rollover around first of Sept. I've been
semi under the weather for damn near 3 weeks now and that hasn't helped
matters any at all.
Douglas Lloyds 67 is one of the next buses to come in the shop if anyone has
any contact info on him please let me know or tell him to touch base with
me, i need to make sure he's ready to roll before i bring it into the shop,,
ok later and good luck to Dan and safe journey..
