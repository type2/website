Subject: [VB] Vanagon Engines vs Loaf into Split

Couldn't tell you if it can/should/whatever
be done, but here's what I do know . . .

The engines in the air cooled Vanagons are
esentially the same as the 79 and older, with
some exhaust changes, FI changes and such, but
for overall size, the same.  BTW the '79 had
some one year only ($$$) exhaust and heat exch
components.  Vanagons went water in mid '83 or
so.  I know, there were diesels in '80, but
I'm not counting them!

While I had a Vanagon, I relied on the loaf list
for aircooled engine expertise, and the Vanagon
list to the rest.

Could you illuminate me on the sunroof standard
you checked out for another listee?
I don't even have a job/income and I'm 
asking about a probable 'project' bus, sheesh!

Also, I was told that I can fit up to an 81 Vanagon engine in the Split
without any modification.  Is this true?  I thought the latest engine
I could shoehorn into the bus without any modifications to the bus or engine
was a 79 Loaf?  What's the story?
