Subject: dual oil relief

We have an engine case number F1 998 088 but it has dual oil relief.
The book shows this is a 65-67 engine case but the dual relief is
indicated as a 70-71 (the reliefs are on the same side).  Clara said F
case was originally a 1300 for a 66 bug.  Looks like they were dual
relief # F 1 778 164 to F2 200 000, before that they were single relief.

Has anyone replaced the stock oil relief valve plain plunger with a type
3 angular grooved type plunger to get 15deg lower oil temperature (by
increasing flow through the cooler)? (Discouraged by the VW factory
according to the Chilton 49-71 VW guide)

Other Question:
Anyone come up with the plans for the 'howard bits' for the doghouse
cooler?
