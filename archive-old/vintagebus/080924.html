Subject: Re: [VB] Testing Old Thermostat

it should say on the side of the thermostat... some are 65C, I think some 70 
or 75.  which is under water boiling.  Basically I clean them with solvent and 
toothbrush first, then dropped them in hot water.   I like to clean them so 
grit  doesn't get stuck between fins which can puncture them.

Anyone know how to test an old thermostat?  I'm assuming you can apply heat of
some sort and see if it expands but, I'm not sure at what temperature it
should expand and how far.
I found this in the archive:

&quot;The test involves using an old metal pan with water and placing it on the
stove.  Only mild heat is required.  If the thermostat is working, it will
expand.  I found out long ago that too much heat will over extend the
thermostat and ruin it because it stretches out too far.&quot;
