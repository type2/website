&gt;i have looked at pix of your 58, and i have looked at an original
&gt;58 safari bus in person and there is one difference.  On the 62 and older
&gt;busses only the safari busses got the upper indent in the window channel,
&gt;this doesnt look to be added to yours..

I have been gathering parts to restore my 58 15 window for 11 years, I have 
yet to come up with an original safari window section to graft into my bus.  
so, I just put my rust free set of original safaris in the best way I could 
with what we have.  I was also only able to find one nos pre 63 dog leg.  I 
will have to modify the other nos post 63 dog leg to look correct.  same with 
my drivers side corner,  it had a large tail light hole in it, and we 
modified that to look right too.   I have had my 58 bus for 12 years now, and 
it is sentiment that is restoring the bus, not a big fat wallet.  I just can 
not see throwing away a bus like that.
I hope to see some original safari buses when i go to california, we just 
dont have many around here in north carolina.
