&gt; &gt; VW has been on the web rampage again, been after all web sites using the
&gt; &gt;  letters VW in there url. In my opinion I would and will personally 
&gt;BOYCOTT
&gt; &gt;  any VW show backed or at VW o A
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ronnie
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I know of 5 in the last week alone.
&gt;
&gt;I agree. VW would have to do some major tire licking before I would show 
&gt;up.
&gt;Why should we help out VWoA with a show when they wont even allow us to 
&gt;have
&gt;their damn letters?
&gt;


I have been sending stuff to this list like crazy tonight: Bear with me I 
want to rant, and its late Friday OK?


If I have said this before tune out, hit delete.

I went looking for a car for a friend. I decided to visit VW. I was looking 
at the cars for sale and the salesman walked up. I had a friend with me who 
said, is this your new car that really goes fast and handles well? (not 
exact words, I have no idea what car goes fast and handles well). He said 
no, that cars under the carport over there. I said I have my child with me 
(2 yrs old) so I cant test drive it today. He said I couldnt test drive it 
any day. They dont let anyone test drive it. I said &quot;why? is VW afraid it 
will break down?&quot; He didnt like that. He said VW only makes so many of these 
and that they dont allow any to go out cause they want the owner to have a 
zero mileage car. Now we are talking about a 28,000 dollar car here. I said 
WHAT? NO WAY. He said the purchaser will have to buy that car, no options, 
that color period. (Ok im smart enough to know that the early bug came in 
black only but its like 2001).
So we start discussing this car and I tell him thats ridiculous, my friend 
starts talking performance, and I feel like going into a tirade about how VW 
means people car etc. Well heres the kicker, he starts telling my friend 
about how this car performs. Opps. He goes on and on about performance. 
Wrong thing to say. My friend stops him and says:
1. VW is a low price car anywhere in the world. This car is not special.
2. My BUG will outperform this car anyday. (Hes right, my bug will eat it 
for lunch).
3. We could go to any high dollar car manufacturer and test drive.

Thoughts:
I hate VW as it is today, their parts counter looked up many parts that 
should be available (we are talking clutch parts, engine parts, simple 
stuff) that isnt, and they had attitude.


They gave my kid a balloon though. Guess that makes me want the car I cant 
drive.............
