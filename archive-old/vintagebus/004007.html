Ronnie,

The plastic cage is actually a spacer that keeps the metal rollers spaced
evenly apart... like 7 rollers or so total. even support is good. support
goes downhill when cage rots, and growling goes up.
The other upper bearing (inboard) must then do all of the support work for
that axle section.
He could probably make it there safely, but he should plan on going through
the reduction box and (IMHO) replacing all of the bearings upon arrival.
I don't think it will seize... the actual pressures and resistances between
the redux gears will tend to push the axles away from eachother... if I'm
thinking correctly on that one.
The growling is indicative of unevenly spaced rollers and improper
clearances or alignment of the gears.... something like that. Be advised
that this accelerates wear on the gears.
So, take it easy when driving...
Diana Kreb's '66 Westfalia lost a chunk or two of the plastic spacer when I
changed out the redux box oil... but there was no time to tear all that
apart and fix it right at the time. I told her in so many words that it was
not a good thing, but that I felt confident that she would make it back. She
did make it back to Vancouver from here (_at_ 4,000 miles?).

&gt;rich started loosing gear oil out of his reduction box
&gt;upon inspection they noticed that the plastic cage around
&gt;the outer bearing is melted
&gt;
&gt;1. would it be safe to drive on this say 400 miles till they reach redding?
&gt;at wolfgangs
&gt;
&gt;they say there is no excessive play on the axle, but i was concerned  that
&gt;it might seize and cause some major damage, any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;2. is there anybody in or near fresno that might be able to
&gt;help them, they are in a town called kingsberry (or something like that)
&gt;
&gt;or somewhere in route that they may nurse it to get help
