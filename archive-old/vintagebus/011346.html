 Well with spring coming sometime in the near future(i hope) here in
Iowa I need some advice on some stuff. I need to pick up a couple dog
legs, rocker panel and a small piece of front floor section.......I've
heard some not so great things about some of the repro stuff and was
wondering if anyone could steer me in the right direction as far as
getting some decent metal. In the junkyards around here a split find is
like getting to shake hands with Bigfoot, good luck! The ones I do find
are usually tooooo far gone to do anything with, except cry.So I need to
know where I can get what I need. Any and all input is much
appreciated...Thanks

Shawn
