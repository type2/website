&lt;&lt; We have a Bernina sewing machine at the house. I am not much of a seamster
 but thought I would have a go at trying to fix the seam. Any thoughts on 
what kinda needle or thread I should use? I have also considered doing it by 
hand with sailmakers thread and needle. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ncbus,
The biggest problem is that if you do not sew the new thread into the old 
holes with a machine you will make new holes and this will weaken the 
material like perforations on postage stamps.  So it might just be best for 
you to hand sew it with sail makes needle.  Best thread we have heard is 
polyester, but you really should check with your local upholstey supply shop 
for more info.  Eric&amp;Barb
