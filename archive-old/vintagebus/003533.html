Here is what has worked for me in a similar situation. I took a come along (a.k.a. a fence puller) and some scrap paneling with me. I got the trailer right up as close as possible. Jacked up the bus and put the paneling under the frozen tires, shinny side down. I ratcheted up the wire and the bus slid right on the trailer. Of course I had to rearrange the pulling point from time to time to &quot;steer&quot; it, but it worked fine. When we were home I put the trailer where I wanted the bus, chained it to a phone pole and carefully pulled the trailer out from under the bus. 

Now, getting it to roll was not so easy but at least it was at home where the pullers, Kroil, coffee, and time were.


Good luck, have fun.
