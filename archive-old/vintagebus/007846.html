 You save all your vacation days, sick days, and take comp. time for all
the overtime and weekend work you do.
 Thom, you must get vac, sick, comp time with your high tech job. Save it
all up and go for it and travel farther than kelly park.
 If not work your way like Stephen G and Clara did. Come on down to ARIZONA
and work for Ronnie and stay at his at home camp sites. You will never be
the same again.

John Howard
