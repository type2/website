Subject: re:parking my bus

i stored my bus last winter...i dont remember everything i did, but here are
a couple things-change the oil right before you store it. i heard that the
oil starts to become acidic as soon as it is run the engine-the longer the
more acidic. so much that it can eat through some part of the engine or
other.

there is also some fuel stabilizer stuff-you put this in your gas tank-i
forget if you run it after or not. anyway it is supposed to keep the carbs
from gumming up i think.

i also washed my bus to get any crap off-dont want any salt that may be on
there to have the time to eat all winter.
 hope that helps
