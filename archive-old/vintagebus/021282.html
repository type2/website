Subject: identify a westy interior
Message-ID: &lt;207c2c56.24b396f2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i just scored a westy interior today from my club presidents 66' Kombi he 
just bought then decided to sell. How do I know what kind it is? it is dated 
2/63
Its got the cabinets in back ,a z-bed, and facing the rear there is a 2/3 
westy bench w/ storage behind and underneath it. It has the faucet / fridge 
setup behind the passenger in a bench seat busnext to the bench .It also has 
a table and is in overall great condition.
How much should I have paid for this? I gave him 200$ for it and thought that 
was a pretty nice price.
thanx - pete 
59' panel
