I drive my 1966 EZ Camper everyday. I only live about 10 miles from work
right now, but during the almost 10 years I've owned it, I've lived up to
30 miles from work. I've gone through three trannies (the original, one
beat-up replacement and my current one) and a handful of engines, but it's
kept on ticking. I have a stock 1600sp and a freeway flyer and have had no
problems (knock on wood paneling). There are a handful of hills that I have
to go up and down and I barely notice them either. When my speedo was
working last month, it was usually at 65-70 on the freeway, and I always
knew I could push it harder if I wanted.

John Winkley, the pres of SV2s, used to drive his 67 Deluxe to work
everyday too. 1600dp and a freeway flyer. He lives in Oceanside, CA (San
Diego) and works in Anaheim, CA (Los Angeles)! We're talking at least 100
miles one way. He did that everyday for about 4 years. Now THAT's
dedication! Or insanity...

Yes, I think your 66 will handle daily driving!
