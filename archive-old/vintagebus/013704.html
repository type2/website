Moving right along, I decided to see what I could do about mounting a new
speaker in the bus as the paper in the old one was non-existant (or should
 have been.) The speaker I was using to listen with is out of a Pioneer boom
box that my dad yoinked from someone's trash years ago. Since this speakerwas
smaller, I decided to grind out the center portion of the existing bus speaker
(which I did.) Then I simly fit my new speaker inside the framework of the old
one and held it together with 4 wire ties. Now I have a speaker that mounts in
the stock location without having to drill new holes and run mounting brackets
and all.

i had a similar problem with my speaker, I could stick my fingers through the
paper. I ended up buying a new one from Radio Shack about $7, it fit
perfectly, no need to drill any holes. Although your method sounds cheaper, i
wonder if the sound might be a bit sharper if the speaker isn't shaking in its
mount?
