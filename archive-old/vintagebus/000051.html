 Hi All,
 I just obtained another bus today and I am having
 difficulty figuring out what it is.  A general description
 is as follows.  It has the small rear hatch window with the
 sliding bar to support it.  It has flat front turn
 indicator lights but I am not certain they are original.
 It has three non functional vents high above the working
 vents on each side. It also has some sort of funky camper
 conversion, all wood, with aluminum sliding windows that I
 have seen on another bus somewhere.
 It has an ID plate behind the passenger seat with the
 following info:
 1B 052
 360 027 178 195
 uy 211 blue 948738
 ___________________ &gt;&gt;
1B 052   - are you sure this is what it says?   this should be the build date
next line is M codes-
360- n Am specs, etc etc
UY- port shipped to, 211- panel van ( the vents at the upper back corners 
confirm this- and that it is a bench seat, windows put in by one of the 
conversion people who made panels into campers)
Blue- dove blue paint
948738 is the VIN, which puts it as made in May 1962, maybe that first line 
is 
18 05 2 - meaning production date 18th May 1962.

Thus the flat/ fried egg turn signals would be correct, and it would have the 
oval taillights like 62 through 71.

I believe someone recently posted a couple URLs with M code info, how to 
decipher the plate, and yes VW attached them with little screws.

Always make sure your title matches the VIN on the vehicle.
