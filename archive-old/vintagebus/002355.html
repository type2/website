&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This came from the Houston VW Club list. It's not really bus related but
&gt; maybe someone has seen the body?         (bus content...   I
&gt; figure the trans
&gt; problem I was having is the fact that the trans was 2 qts low on gear oil)
&gt; &lt;&lt;Charles Boucher, who was supposedly restoring my Hebmüller #6,
&gt; the oldest
&gt; in
&gt; North America, has lost the body to my car. He now will not
&gt; return my calls.
&gt; If anyone knows the whereabouts of body #6, please contact Don Garies at
&gt; dgaries808_at_aol_dot_com. Thanx.
