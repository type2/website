&lt;&lt; Clymer's manual says&gt;&gt;
Hi Tom,
That is your first problem.  Clymer is not a really good manual.  Matter of 
fact some of the tuning procedures are a good way to reduce a ACVW engine 
life span.  You really need to get the Bentley reprint of VW's bus shop 
manual for 1963-67.

&lt;&lt; I was sent a wooden alignment tool, is this tool only to align the disc 
over
 the gland nut opening?&gt;&gt;
Yes to make it much easier to install the engine on the tranny input shaft.

&lt;&lt;And *most* importantly do the pressure plate and disc have to be placed in a
 certain position on the flywheel?&gt;&gt;
The disc no.  The pressure plate to the flywheel yes!  You need to look at 
the outer rim of the flywheel for an area/s that were drilled to remove some 
of the steel there.  Then do the same inspection to the pressure plate.  If 
each has one area lightened you really want to position the two lightened 
areas at about 90 degrees of each other.    Makes a big differance on how the 
engine runs, sounds, and rattles you to deaf.
 
&lt;&lt;One last question:   My old disc was completely worn out on the pressure 
plate side, while the flywheel side was like new. What does this ussually 
indicate?  &gt;&gt;
Sounds like the clutch disc might have been too tight on the input shaft 
splines or the material on one side was soft or there was no lubrication on 
the splines.  Which there should be a very, very light layer.  Being the way 
spare parts are now a days it would be a good idea to fit the clutch disc 
onto the input shaft splines to make sure they fit properly.   Eric&amp;Barb
