Subject: Re: [VB] gettin' of the grease/mud

Hey Brian,

I buy Oil Eater in the gallon from Costco and a scrub brush.  Works great and leaves the paint.  Sandblasting won't remove all of the greasy, muddy gunk.  If you need to sand blast, you need to clean the parts first.

&gt; I have some valve covers and misc. tin with the 40 years of road gunk/oil/dirt and whatever else. They are straight and from the small areas I have cleaned off the paint is still intact. What is the best way to clean off the gunk without screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a miracle/mystery product just a way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What method?
