Subject: Re: [VB] paint gun for spraying POR-15 ?

Raymond-
www.POR15_dot_com has all the info and a free paper catalog.
As far as structural integrity goes, if it is bad, paint won't help,
then replace it. POR 15 is PAINT, just designed to adhere to rusty metal
and does a very good job. I save on the cleaner ( didn't buy it ) and
the thinner ( lacquer thinner works for me, for spray application ).
But when they say you can't paint over it without &quot; tie-coat &quot; you
better believe it. Get the black semi-gloss for underbody, it's good.
This stuff will hold on heavily rusted metal, but there's a lot to be
said for sandblasting and other proper repair procedures and materials.

I have heard of POR 15 but haven't researched it's use and how to apply it.
Is there a point of no return where the offending metal must be cut out and
replaced (less structural members ! Have to replace them), and is it used as
a primer, and if so, how sandable is it.
