Hi all. I have finally gotten some time and energy to work on Lucinda, my
poor suffering 67 Deluxe. I am stuck on the front inside brake lines. I
have some that are bent to approximate bendings, but they do not sit flat
on the backing plate and the springs rub against them. Can I drill two
small holes in the backing plate and run wire ties in to pull the brake
lines flat to the palte? Or is there another way to get them flat?
        TIA
        Mike
