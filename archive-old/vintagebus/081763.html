at you all don't realize is that I have dual external oil cooling.  I have an 
external radiator mounted on the left side louvers, and I have oil seeping 
out of every seal on top of the engine.  The oil atomized throughout the engine 
compartment is definitely cooler, though getting it to re-enter the crankcase 
has been a problem.
bad place for a cooler... makes the engine cooling air warmer (doh!) which 
will actually make your heads run hotter.  
  sounds like time to pull the motor and replace some seals, relocate the 
cooler (or ditch it)
