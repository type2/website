&lt;&lt; So I went to start up the bus last night, and I got a good puff
 of smoke out of the ignition switch.  From then on, when I turn
 the key on (first position) the starter kicks in and the bus
 wants to run.   
 
 I took the speedo out today and played with it, and it seems 98%
 of the time, I get this.  Sometimes it works normally.  The switch
 sometimes seems very stiff, too.  
 
 Could be that the switch just gave up the ghost, and I have to accept
 the fact, buy a new one and move on?  &gt;&gt;
............................

yes, get a new switch.   when they spit smoke it's over for them.  I guess 
you could remove it, take the electricals out and examine them though, if you 
really want to.

dunno what it'd have to do with the speedo through
