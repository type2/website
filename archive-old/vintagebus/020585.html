I'm going to MT to pick up a table and a number of boxes.  I should be
wearing a Tom Connor roof rack and a relatively empty bus.  I'm offering
some spare parts room if I can save someone some shipping money, in
either direction.  I'm leaving Aberdeen, WA the morning of July 27th and
am returning July 30th.  Email me as soon as possible.  I guess it's
appropriate to say first come, first served.
