I also have one on the Mother that shows the VW stick man is whacking the
brat kid with a Hazet wrench as he pisses on a VW emblem.

That really ticks off the chevy four wheel drivers around this little small
south georgia town.  Needless to say, I am the only VW bus driver.  I am
also a huge guy (6.4/280lbs.) so no one says much other than &quot;Hi&quot;.

Peace, Love, joy people!

&quot;Lessons learned are like bridges burned, you only need to cross them but
once.  Is the knowledge gained worth the price of the pain?  Are the spoils
worth the cost of the heart?&quot;
