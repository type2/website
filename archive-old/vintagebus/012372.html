Subject: Booger in Nosecone- can't quite put my finger on it...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Part III in the continuing saga of the stubborn booger in the nosecone...

Hello again Volks,

It started out being a warm day outside, for a change, so I decided to try to fix the problem with my tranny.

Pulled the engine, took the front tranny mount loose from the frame, took the 2 large bolts out on the rear hanger, disconnected the clutch cable and took the reduction boxes loose. WITHOUT taking the brake lines or e-brake cables loose, I was able to pull the tranny back about 3 inches, enough to get the nosecone off. I didn't realize that I was going to get liberally doused with tranny oil. I rolled out as quickly as I could, a little too late, and got a pan to catch what little was left that wasn't on my shirt. Oh well. 

Got the nosecone loose and looked inside. Well, there wasn't much space to see what might have been amiss, and I've never been inside of a nosecone before, so I got my buddy James to crawl under there and get the shifter thingies lined up properly. Put it all back together, linkage hooked up, engine in, wired etc... had to crawl around in the puddle of tranny oil to get some of those nosecone nuts back on.

The shifter felt better, and would go into reverse, 1st, 2nd and 4th, but no 3rd. Maybe it will loosen up if I get it rolling. Got the engine started (had to get James to jump me off). 1st seemed to be working ok, shifted to 2nd. The whole thing started bogging down, just like last time. Shifted back into 1st, bogged down again. By this time I was about a block up the street and the engine was starting to make some noise, so I backed it all the way back into my driveway.

SO, after a few hours work on a tight deadline (I'm moving out in about a week), I've accomplished... nothing. Well, except that I'm all black all over and I smell bad from swimming in tranny oil. Geez.

I've got another engine lined up, so I just need to get another tranny (and I just rebuilt one of those danged reduxes, too). Then I'll hafta tow it somewhere where I can work on it...

I think I'm ready for a shower and a beer now, not necessarily in that order...
