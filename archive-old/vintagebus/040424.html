Just thought I'd share some personal experiences of late. Saved by grace; not wisdom:

Front tranny mount broke a couple weeks ago, evidenced by very stiff shifting...almost impossible to get into gear at speed. Pulled the engine and tranny/redux box assembly and replaced the 3 tranny mounts.

After putting everything in, all seemed fine. I had tightened bolts from redux boxes to torsion bars by feel...pretty tight. Then yesterday, I suddenly noticed that I couldn't downshift to first without grinding...or without first shifting to 2nd and then down to first. Mental note: someone said to torque  bolts from redux boxes to torsion arms to 75 or 80 lbs.

That evening after work and before coming home, I sacrificed a fairly decent shirt to crawl under my bus and check the bolts. LOOSE!!!! Tightened as well as I could given gravel in my back. ALSO, the lower nuts on the engine to tranny studs were LOOSE! One was loose to my fingers!!! (I think this is what caused the grinding when downshifting.0) I tightened these too. Double checked all of this this morning and got the torque specs just right.

My question is, what sort of offering to St. Pon is now appropriate, considering I was able to trade one shirt for a dropped engine and tranny on the highway?

Also, thanks to all who have been discussing redux boxes and torsion bars lately.

;) Joe
