I having problems figuring out my numbers on my bus.
this is from the tag behind the pass. front seat:
166
430 042 025 108
TE 2312 523642 6171849

I understand that the first is date, second line is M-codes, the third line 
is export, model code, color, body number.  I do not understand the paint 
numbers and model code.

The plack on the overhead air vent pass side is as this:
Typ. 23-42
Heizg. Typ. 2/255 A Prutz   S45
Fahrgest. - Nr.     236171849

does the first line mean? The second line mean? and the third?
The in the cargo doors on the bench lower left hand coner its printed:
Westfalia - Werke K-G
SO 42  6123  1966
Ok I know a SO-42 meaning is,
