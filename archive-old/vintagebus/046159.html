And a while back Dave Easterwood told me that many commercial vehicles came
without rear view mirrors. I'm not sure he stated it explicitly, but I
inferred that passenger buses (standards) were supposed to always have the
rear view.

Well, I have a '64 green and white standard with pleated seats and no rear
view...never had one. Original interior.

well, trying to see if I have any info on that, I found that they moved the
plate to the side of the roof vent at ch # 1 200 098 (11 Nov 63) for most type
2s, at ch# 1 202 225 (14 Nov 63) for trucks.

The only mirror mention I find i that that
 at ch # 215 099 006. 
Interior rear view mirror
&quot;Now: Mirror surface increased. 
 Mirror arm bent sideways and mounted on rubber pads&quot;

Then they give a useless info about changing the grease in the rear view
mirror at ch # 215 171 616.  I care.

There is a mention of towing equipment in Aug 66.  Pretty cool.

yup- most of the rear view window less buses I've seen have been panels.
Seemed cheap to leave that off, IMHO.
