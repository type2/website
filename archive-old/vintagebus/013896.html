&gt; Having read some posts recently about how well VW trannies and motor cases
&gt; burn is always intriguing.  Sets off a picture in my mind of the high
&gt; heat, white light fun stuff around the campfire on cool nights with a host
&gt; of friends and some Rumplemintz too most likely.

Been there, done that.  I think a 36 or 25hp case would be even
better than the 1600 we burned.  Even with two pairs one sunglasses -one
of them glacier glasses -it was too bright to look at.

&gt; But have you seen where a 250,000 pound pile of titanium shavings caught
&gt; fire outside a mill in Oregon last night?  Now that must've been quite the
&gt; fire!  And not much could be done....anyone know what would happen if you
&gt; tried to douse a titanium fire with water hoses????
&gt; oooooooh boy!

The intense heat disassociates the hydrogen and oxygen, which 
then explode.  The correct way to douse a metal fire is with Metl-X
powder (available at your local fire department supply house) or with
sand (make some cool impromptu glass scuplture!).  Or wait it out.
