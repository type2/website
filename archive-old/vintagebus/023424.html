Hi Lee,

I too am struggling with overheating and need to pull my engine and track it
down... recently had to cancel a 5,000 mile trip due to it running 250 when
it should have been running 230 or less :)

Anyway -- you seem primarily focused on your distributor, that is pretty
easy to tell.  Go out and purchase or borrow a strobe light and watch it
advance with the engine running.  That will totally eliminate your concerns
in this area, as at 3500rpm you should be fully advanced (with most any
distributor).  You could always rev (at idle) to 4000rpm to really be sure
-- if you can stand being that close to the engine :)

At full advance, where it will go no further, you should be at or bellow 32
degrees.

If you have a stock pulley instead of a degree wheel, just mark some spots
as a point of reference and you can look at them more closely after you stop
the engine.

You can purchase a strobe for $30 or less if you shop around, I advise it --
as total advance is often a much better point of reference than the &quot;base&quot;
advance at 0 RPM.

What is your carb, how is it jetted?  How is your muffler?  Make sure none
of those carb to dizzy hose lines are leaking air, as that would be a cause
of overheating too.

Good luck.

My new bus has a late &quot;H&quot; block 1500 in it (engine number indicates
early bay). I fitted a Gene Berg &quot;idiot stick&quot;,
the one which goes in the dip stick hole and flickers the oil light on
when the oil temp is around 226 F.

So the question is, do carb and/or distributor make a massive difference
to ignition advance, I mean is it possible to have a distributor which
is advancing too much and causing the extra temperature, maybe cause by
the wrong dizzy or the wrong carb producing too much vacuum.  The
genuine 64 edition workshop manual talks about relly quite different
vacuum advance units with quite different advance curves, but I don't
have any information on early bay (late H block) engines
