&gt; &gt; I figure I would chime in on my recent encounter,
&gt; &gt;     Well, the other day I picked up my two front door handles from
getting
&gt; &gt; re-keyed at
&gt; &gt; the dealership...
&gt; &gt; ...and asked him how much? &quot;Don't worry about it, and bring in your
&gt; other locks
&gt; &gt; whenever you want to.&quot;  I was ready for a hefty fee for the amount of
time
&gt; &gt; it took to make them work properly because the were frozen due to years
of
&gt; &gt; non-use. But no charge!!! I have been very impressed with my experiences
&gt; &gt; with them in the past, but this one takes the cake!
&gt;
&gt; Well, don't let their good deed go unpunished!  Tell us the name of the
&gt; dealer!
