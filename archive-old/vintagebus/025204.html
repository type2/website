Subject: What year engine did I buy?? / Vallejo Show Report
Message-ID: &lt;372CEF3F.6C998566_at_mcn_dot_org&gt;

Hi all-

Just got back from the Vallejo show.  Early on it was light
rain then drizzly.  I would say the show was significantly
smaller than last years.  I was outathere by 9:00am.  No
large dealers, someone mentioned there was also a show in
L.A. too.  Walked thru the show area early on and didnt even
see a bus or truck entered.  Your typical motley collection
of them otherwise in the swap and display areas.   Swap was
decent size,  my guess about 40 swappers total.  No good
parts found for me, once again no middle seats......  My
money however was burning a hole in my pocket, so I relieve
some of the heat by forking out some reasonable cash for
what I was told is a 25 HP '54 motor in so so shape as I was
walking out.  It looked vintage, so I bit and got reeled
in.  Really don't know what Im doing when it comes to
engines.

My question is, what the heck did I buy....  really?  Is
there a spot on the web where I can look up the engine
numbers and find out?  Or is there a gracious soul out there
that can give me a hand.  Here are the specifics and out of
the ordinary details that I noticed about it:

The numbers on the block are 1690471.  The generator stand
is cast one piece with the block. (to what year did this
occur??) Has a solex 28 pci carb with a glass bowl.  all
steel fuel lines.  The air cleaner is a round symetrical
bubble type with the number 111.129.611b on it. It sits
directly on the carb. Also has LB609 and Knecht stamped on
it.  It has a spring loaded &quot;venturi&quot; type thingy at the fan
intake that goes in and out..   Never seen this before.
What the heck is it for?  It also has air ducts that go all
the way to the back of the engine underneath the cylinders.
Has the heater flaps located in this tube near the back half
of the engine.  Never seen this either.  The plug wires are
in good shape but look old.  They are clear (see thru) and
have the name &quot;beldon&quot; on them.  There are also steel tubes
next to the fan shroud just for the spark plug wires to go
thru on the way to the plugs.

Anyway, waz just wondering what I came home with.  Maybe it
belongs on a bug or something.

Happy Bussing,

Gerald
