 John Baker wrote&quot;:    &gt;&gt;There is a quite a large &quot;dead zone&quot; for lack of a 
better description between turning from one side to the other.  You start to 
drift left, steer right to compensate and at first the steering is a little 
hard and then all of a sudden it turns quick, usually too much, resulting in 
over-compensation.  Also, the steering is pretty &quot;hard&quot; once you pass this 
dead zone.&lt;&lt; 

Hi John,
Jack the front end of the bus till the front wheels are just off the ground.  
Have a friend wiggle the steering wheel back and forth while you look for 
slop in the steering/suspension.  After this visual check grease ALL the zerk 
fittings on the beam and king pins, and if you have tie rods/drag link with 
zerk fittings grease them up to!  Keep pumping grease into them till new 
clean grease comes out.  If it takes awhile to get clean grease out it might 
be a good idea to regrease in about 1,000 miles again.  Then on regrease all 
these zerk fittings every 3,000 miles.  Next tighten and slightly loosen the 
proper amount the link pins.
  As for the hardness of the steering it does sound like someone tried to 
quick fix the steering slop instead of doing it the proper way, by tightening 
the steering box too much which will damage it soon.
So break out your Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual and get reading!
