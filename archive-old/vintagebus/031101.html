Running the breather into the manifolds will cause a huge vacuum leak. I
don't think there's any way to avoid that even with a check valve. It'll
screw up your carb jetting and cause backfiring when you decelerate. I
had to learn this the hard way. 8^)

&gt; Nonvintage question: The DC has a bay beam with power assist brakes working off the vacuum under dual dellortos. It has a check valve ahead of the engine. Could, or should, I plumb the breather box to the intake manifolds? Is there a vacuum switch that opens when the dumb driver uses the engine for braking?
