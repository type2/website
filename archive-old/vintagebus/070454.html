&gt; Found plenty of post about the amount of fluid &amp;type of fluid to put in the 
&gt; tranny &amp;RGB's, but how do you check the amount in the RGB?

Hi Jason,
If your tranny and suspension are stock and not loaded till the bus is 
lowered too much, the RGBs are downhill from the tranny center section fill 
line.  Due to this one can fill everything from just the tranny fill plug, 
but filling the tranny and RGBs seems to go faster and is alot easier by 
filling the RGBs first then the tranny center section.  This is also handy 
for if you have a RGB leak on the road in addition to the gear oil in the 
RGBs and axle tubes, about the upper 1/3 of the tranny center section gear 
oil will keep the box filled enough hopefuly long enough for one to notice 
the leak!  This and brake fluid leaks is the big reason why especially on 
long trips the first thing we do upon getting out of one of our VWs is to 
walk around the bus to inspect all four tires for any signs of leakage.
