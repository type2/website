Subject: Question about Intake Manifolds

Folks--

I've never had to deal with this issue before, please forgive my ignorance.

I have a 1500 in my bus, and the smaller diameter
pipe of the intake manifold has a hole it it
(these are the ends that attach to the muffler
base). I bought a replacement manifold, but was
told that the new one was &quot;blocked.&quot; Sure enough,
very little air passes from one end to the other
on the smaller pipe (the larger pipes that go to
the head are clear). How important is it that it
be clear, what is it's function, how can it be cleared?

I tried hanger wire and mechanics wire, but had
an impossible time getting the wires to go past
the curves in the pipe. A little carbon came
out--hardly any. I got better results lightly
tapping on it with a hammer--but still not a lot came out.

Advise is welcome.

Tom
