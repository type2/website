Subject: Re: [VB] Questions from a Groovy Dude

Thanks Scott,
I couldn't agree more and I hope I didn't seem to flippant with my &quot;illusion&quot;
remark. In 1970 I pulled my '68 bug out in front of a truck that was doing
40MPH. It tore the entire front end (including axle) off and I did about 6
donuts. When I came to a stop my feet were sticking out into nothing but air
and both shoes were gone. Way back then I had a seatbelt on - it saved my life.
Regarding my bus I can bolt the rear seat ones behind but I was referring to
the middle seat where the seat itself is non stable (removeable). That's the
one where I'll probably use the u-bolt idea.

Thanks,

60's Guy

&gt; &gt;Why do you &quot;need&quot; seatbelts?  State law? I know in CA, you don't have to
&gt; &gt;have seat belts if the car did not originally come equipped with them.
&gt;
&gt; You NEED seatbelts if you want to have a chance in hell of surviving an
&gt; accident. Yes, it's state law in California, just like the helmet law.
&gt; Seems we have a way of trying to protect those who are too stupid to
&gt; protect themselves here. I've heard all of the excuses for not wearing your
&gt; seatbelts; they hurt my hips/shoulder, they take too long to put on, I just
&gt; forget, they're only for bad drivers, etc. Then there's always the &quot;my
&gt; aunt's friend's cousin was thrown out of her car when she careened off the
&gt; road...if she'd had her seatbelt on she would hav died. Yeah I'm sure that
&gt; happens...but not often enough to matter.
&gt;
&gt; The fact is that in most major accidents, it's the guys in the seatbelts
&gt; that survive or have the best chance. It's not a guarantee...you can't put
&gt; one on and drive like Mad Max and expect to live everytime. But look at the
&gt; auto racers and their wrecks. Again...sometimes one dies like Dale
&gt; Earnhart, but 9 times out of 10, they just pry those good ol' boys out of
&gt; those accordians and they walk away.
&gt;
&gt; Everyone who knows me knows I'm a pretty stock kiinda guy. BUT, the first
&gt; thing I did to my T34 is installed seat belts. When the 56 is on the road,
&gt; it'll have lap belts at least.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the rant, but a very good friend just got killed on my birthday
&gt; last weekend. He and a buddy were in his buddies 2000 Corvette. It got out
&gt; of control on a windy road. His buddy walked away...he had his seatbelt on.
&gt; My friend was a great guy, but he always gave me excuses. I'll miss him on
&gt; his birthday this month, he would have been 38. He was a stubborn guy and
&gt; it cost him his life.
&gt;
&gt; Drive safe...
&gt;
&gt; Scott
