Hi list.

I'm getting ready to hook-up the heater on DARTHVW and
I need a couple of parts/advice.

Very good idea.  Esecially as your Heat system is also your Cooling system.  
...............

I need the &quot;breastplate&quot; engine tin, the one closest
to the bumper, which the heater hoses pass through.

 This is an easy piece to find.  AN 1600 one will fit.  same as bug.  There 
are different varieties as to the preheat holes.   Those are the holes that 
are NOT the large freash ar tube hole on each siide.    Make sure you get a 
1500/1600 one, the 40hp ones are very simlar, but shlightly narrower and will 
not fit a 1600.

 Some have no preheat hole- as there is a kind where the pre heat came from 
the heater box and the hole is in the tin in front of the fan shroud
Some have a small preheat hole on the left
sme have a small preheat hole on the right
some have a small pre heat hole on each side
some have a large (same as fresh air hole size) preheat hole on the right

you can block off what you do not need
These tin can often be found at swaps for about $1.
.................


Also, I have the rubber flanges and short 3&quot; tubes
which pass the heater hose through the tin, what
connects it to the &quot;egg-shaped&quot; pod on the muffler,
..............
just mush them in there.
-- - - - - - - - 
then what connects the bottom exit of that egg-shaped
pod to the heater box? They don't fit together (about
1&quot; or more apart), so I imagine there's a stub or
something?

. . . . .
there are thicker clamps things.  You can get them out of the junkyard, or 
use hose clamps and tin can.
