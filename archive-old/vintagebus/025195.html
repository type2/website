Hi Volks,

&quot;Richard Alexander Palmer&quot; &lt;rapalmer_at_eos.ncsu_dot_edu&gt; wrote to the List:
[...]
&gt; Across the top of the shirt will be the word
&gt; NETVERGNUGEN,
&gt; which is bastardized German for interNET pleasure. It's a takeoff from the
&gt; Fahrvergnugen VW campaign a few years ago.
[...]

Please please make that &quot;U&quot; an umlaut there!  The German word for
pleasure is &quot;Vergnügen&quot;.  I'd love to have a List T-Shirt, but
I'd hate to run around with a spelling error.  I believe that Volkswagen
also used the umlaut in their Fahrvergnügen ads.

If you cannot read my umlauts correctly, the correct way to write an
umlauted letter is to put two dots above it.

You *might* consider to write &quot;Netzvergnügen&quot;, with a &quot;z&quot;, because
that's how we'd probably write it.  We do call the Internet the
Internet, but when speaking of the Net we normally use the German
word &quot;Netz&quot;: &quot;Ich suche das im Netz&quot;, I look for it on the Net.
But that is just an option.  The umlauted &quot;u&quot;, IMHO, is mandantory.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
