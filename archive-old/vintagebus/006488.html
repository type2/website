I'm going to put a T4 oil cooler on my 1600 engine.  I've got a nice used
cooler and adaptor all cleaned up (spent about half an hour scrubbing every
nook and cranny) and when I put the 2 together, my assumptions were correct
that only 1 of the 3 bolts was long enough to pass thru the cooler.  The 2
bolts up by the oil passages fall way short of passing thru the cooler.  I
need 11/16&quot; more of the 6mm stud or about a 4&quot; long 6mm stud.

Does anyone have a couple I could buy?  Thanks for the help.

One more thing - who remembers what magazine issue (either hotvws or vwt)
detailed the modification to the fan shroud to accept the bigger cooler?

Thanks all.
