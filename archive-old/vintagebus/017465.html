Subject: Re: [VB] Bumper Sticker of the Year
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In light of all of last year's Men are from Venus and
Women are from Ur-anus book, I tend to embrace:

Men are from Earth,
Women are from Earth,
Deal with it!

[My sensitive side says]
Oh gosh, Some one please quickly give me an
organically grown channeling by way of the votex of a
protected whale's crystal transponded to an overly
sensitive &quot;intuitive&quot; vegetarian NAMBLA member, tree
sitter's past life! Shhhh!, wait! ~is that Nancy
Griffith music I hear? What? Shirley McClaine out on a
limb again?

&lt;insert that Sam Kinison screaming again&gt;

Now every one shat-up while I's crank up some Hank
Jr., Jerry Jeff Walker and Lynyrd Skynyrd, adjust my
boxers, give a good &quot;out&quot; vurp and hoist the Dixie
flag. (Betty Lou Thelma Liz, fetch Daddy a beer,
wouldja darlin'? ...)
