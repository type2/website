Subject: Crappy Swingaxle boots

Just thought I'd pass this along.  I rebuilt the rear end of the 66 bus with
a freeway flyer trans back in October of 1999.  I could hardly believe my
eyes that only after sitting outside for about 4 to 5 months, the boots have
cracked to the point where they are going to have to be replaced.  They
haven't even been used on the street!  They say, &quot;Volkswagen&quot; on them and
they are just the plain black ones.  Anyone know who makes the best
swingaxle boot out there?  They have cracked along the seam and where the
hose clamps are.  I also saw a few cracks along the accordian folds of the
boot as well.
