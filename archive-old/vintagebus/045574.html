Hi Joe,
First look up Time-Sert on the WWW.  We suggest using a search engine called
metacralwer (http://www.metacrawler_dot_com) that is very helpfull at finding
whatever you want on the world wide web.  They have kits of all kind to repair
stripped threads, including spark plug holes.  Solid inserts are lots better
for areas that one takes apart on occasion.  Eric &amp; Barb
