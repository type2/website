Subject: Re: [VB] Westy birch and bus roof racks

&gt;I just got off the phone with Lenny from West Coast Classics. he is now
&gt;manufacturing replacement baltic birch panels for 64 -67 westys.cut ,sanded
&gt;and urethaned,all you need to do is install them.
&gt;Here's a link to the pics.
&gt;http://www.classicvws_dot_com/westy-wood.htm
&gt;He also is now selling repro roof racks for buses for only $250.
&gt;He doesn't have them on his site just yet , but they are available
&gt;call 714-871-1322
&gt;I have no affiliation with WCC , just a very satisfied customer.



$599 plus shipping for all 9 pieces!  How much was that plywood at Home
Depot?  $15 per sheet was it?  Must be some pretty fancy varnish...
