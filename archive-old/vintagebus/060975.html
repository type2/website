Subject: Oil Survey Results

Unfortunately we had only 52 responses.

Of the 52.
15 use Synthetic(29%)  and 37 use dino(71%).
12 of 15 of the synth users use Mobil 1.(80%)
Of the dino folk it was Bush/Gore between Multigrade (18) and
Single Grade (19) 48.6/51.4.

Where people specified winter/summer I used the summer numbers.
The temp/pressure readings were to come from a fully warmed up engine so
as to be as close to what we would all experience on a road trip.
Avg Idle pressure 16psi
Avg Hwy pressure  39psi
Avg Hwy temps     216F

This is where I wish I had gotten a lot more responses as it gets somewhat
interesting.

Avg temps for syn 218 vs dino 214.

But Avg hot idle for dino was 13.7psi and synth was 23.7 (+73%)
and Avg Hwy for dino was 37psi and for synth was 44.3 (+19.7%)

&quot;Talk amongst yourselves&quot;
As advertised it was a 'survey' draw your own conclusions.
