Well, my '71 uses six clamps for a 2-passenger middle seat.  Two for each
leg &quot;loop&quot;

If your seat has holes for the projections in the clamps, then all you
have to do is install one clamp for each hole.

I puzzled about the long and short T-bolts too, and finally came to the
conclusion that the longer bolts are for use when there is a rubber mat
between the seat and the floor.  I find the longer bolts a lot easier to
install.  Get the clamp in place, the nut threaded on the bolt, then
jiggle the seat around until all the clamps are straight and comfortable.

What I would really like to find are wing nuts to fit the T-bolts to make
removing the middle seat a no-tools exercise.

George Lyle, love my Deluxe Station Wagon!

&gt; Being I have never driven a bus with a middle seat or paid any attention to
&gt; how many clamps holds it in can anybody enlighten me.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a pile of clamps, base plates and T bolts but I don't know how many
&gt; and what parts to use.
&gt; 
&gt; short or long t bolts, with or with-out the nipple, 2 or seat base plates if
&gt; any at all, etc. etc.,
