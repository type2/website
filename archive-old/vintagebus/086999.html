Subject: A new bus!!

Gee I wish it was mine. While I was sitting in my open garage working this 
afternoon next to my beautiful bus,  a tow truck rolls up in front of my 
house. Can't see what he has on the back (my bus is blocking my view), but 
he is looking at my bus. He moves up a little and low and behold, about a 59 
is behind him. So... I walk out and he asks me where I want it!! Damn, he 
had the wrong address. Turns out he was delivering it 2 doors up the street. 
Guess I may have to meet my lousy neighbor with the barking dog.

Chris
