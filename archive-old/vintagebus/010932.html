Subject: Re:  [VB] No rear turn signal lights in a 1967 bus
To: rsneil_at_tva_dot_gov, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I am trying to figure out a cheap way to make my rear turn signal lamps
work.  I do not have the proper relay in this '67 bus.  In fact, there is NO
relay for the rear turn signal lights.  The front turn signals work, but the
relay is a non-standard (for a VW) generic turn signal relay.  I plan to
build a circuit using off the shelf relays to drive the rear signals.

I need to know how the lights are supposed to work.  If I understand
correctly, the break light and the turn signal light is the same bulb with
two filaments.  Is that correct?  I think that the break light function is
totally independent of the turn signal/tail light function.  Correct???
When the lights are off, and a turn signal is sent (via the turn signal
switch) to the bulb, the bulb will flash on and off.  When the lights are
on, the turn signal will cause the light to flash off and on.  Correct???

I am thinking about using two auto relays, with the turn signal picked up
from the working front signal.  This will pick-up the appropriate relay, and
flash the rear lamp.  Will this work??  What other considerations do I need
to think about?  Does anyone have any other suggestions?

yes you can use two relays.  you can also look for 9pin boxes in junkyards 
(bay buses, bugs) and swap meets.  any how, 

get you a colour wiring diagram.   download it for frreeeeee  off the 
vintagebus_dot_com site.

the rear lights in N am spec is on bulbs with two filaments.  one filament is 
taillights.  the brighter filament is brake lights/turn signals.   Brake 
light wires are red/black stripes.   read the diagram. 

  now why not plug the rear lights into the same relay that the front lights 
are at?   put the hind left (HL)w ith the front left (VL) and the hind right 
(HR) with the front right (VR).     use those wonderfl two into one 
conections vw used that are all plastic covered so bare wires do not ground 
anywhere.  available in dead superbeetles at a junkyard.
