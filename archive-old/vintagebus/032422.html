Shawn-

Not to be a pr*ck, but why wouldn't you want to share a picture of one of 
the rarest busses any of us has ever heard of?  And why, especially after 
some are questioning its existence, *wouldn't* you prove us wrong?  Go 
ahead, make me look like a fool - post a picture, if you dare.

&gt;Sorry you feel that way. The truck is sitting in my back yard as we speak.
&gt;It made it home after about a month of flatbed BS. It hasn't made it into
&gt;the shop yet though due to lack of $$$.
&gt;
&gt;As far as sending you a picture of it, I'll pass at this time. So please go
&gt;ahead and think of it as a lie if you so desire. There has been more than
&gt;one list member in the Seattle / Tacoma area that have seen / sat in it.
&gt;
&gt;Hell two people on the Bay window list wrote messages stating they had seen
&gt;it on the freeway. One said I think they saw it outside of Roseburg, OR, and
&gt;the other one... I can't remember where.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway make it to the Puyallup spring show next year. That will be the first
&gt;time I will drive it to a gathering, and at that point pictures will be
&gt;allowed.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for your inconvience,
&gt;Shawn
