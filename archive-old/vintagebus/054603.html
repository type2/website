Subject: wanted:rear hatch w/no rear window

hey everyone- ive bee4n working on my 58 dd panel and i would really like to have one of those rear doors (the one above the engine conpartment) that has NO window. i dont mean i want one with no glass, i want one that is jsut a solid piece of metal. i think these are UBER sexy. i would be willing to trade one with a window (w/glass) pluss cash or othere parts. if you have seen one around, or know someone who has one, please tell me. i dont car if it has a few dents as long as the metal isnt torn and there is no cancer. paint doesnt matter.
thanks,
