 a while back i was struggling with the front embelm top fastener on one of
my buses..  started with about 5 spare of the correct type fixings..  lost
them all a few times...  when my magnet on a string finally came back from
the depths of the front valence reconescence mission without any survivors.
i went for a search and rescue..  searched all my boxes of bits and
pieces.... but no, not a single thing was gonna save my planned weekend...
couldn't bare to drive my bus naked like that -- the shame!!!

alas, it was time to carry on with other jobs..  fitted my new number
plate..

eyecarumba....  thats it!!! :)

i squashed one of those plastic nuts to an oval shape with a pair of
pliers..  the springyness of the plastic was ample to push fit to the top
pin of the emblem...  a couple of turns with the long noses..
hmm... away we were! :)

a temporary fix that was used a few years ago...  still there now.
don't know if the same will work on your script?
Glynn  - no dread in fitting his emblem ever again.


&gt; Ok, I have a question for you truck owners.  I was trying (in vain) to
&gt; mount the rear &quot;Volkswagen&quot; emblem above the engine lid on my '64 SC last
&gt; night.  After losing about 5 of the mounting washers in the &quot;black hole&quot;
&gt; which doubles as the crossmember/hinge carrier piece, I gave up.  Is there
&gt; some better way to attach this thing?  A 3 or 4 inch length piece of small
&gt; diameter vinyl tubing pressed over the pins perhaps?  I'm curious what
&gt; others have done...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
