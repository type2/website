&gt; Exactly the point Gene Berg made back in the eighties. An open air dyno
&gt; test is not the same as an enclosed real life engine compartment where
&gt; you have to deal with the ventilation the factory provided you.

Hello Guys   I'll throw 2 cents in here  Any time you increase the ccs of the 
motor you will increase the amount of air needed for that motor.  Vw designed 
the openings for a small motor .  On my 59 panel running a stroker 1835cc 
with dual 40 dells i will have overheating problems if I run over 65 mph.  under 
65 and I have no problems runs 210 degrees . Anybody have the vw transporter 
and microbus  Specification guide book ??  on page 61 there is a splitty that 
came a factory scoop that allowed more air in.  Also the Australian motels came 
with extra vents (page 58)  This makes a lot of sense and backs up just what 
ray said  later and have fun  mark dearing  salem Import Service  salem va
