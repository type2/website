Subject: Sighting - 21 window on NBC news!

Was anybody else just watching the NBC Nightly News? The last story was 
on Veterans Day. They featured a few guys who were Vietnam POWs. In the 
background behind one of the guys was a pretty SWR/BG 21 window Deluxe. 
It was a nice one and was visible in the background in a lot of the 
shots. I missed the beginning of the story, so I don't know where all 
this was done. It was a current interview, not footage from years ago.
