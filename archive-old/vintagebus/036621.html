&lt;&lt; I can only speak for our Jan 30 1951 Microbus that is still in original 
condition--AB VW
 51 has 2 sets of pinstriping--there is a hand pinstriping below the belt 
line and another
 above the belt line--Being a microbus there is no bright trim along the belt 
line like a
 deluxe--But in Jan of 1951 the Deluxe had not been made yet--that came later 
in 1951. &gt;&gt;

Your the only guy I know that states all the facts, just for a simple 
question.
