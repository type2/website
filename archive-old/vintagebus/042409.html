&gt; Hi, I was wondering how much you had to pay for the tool to remove the tie 
&gt; rod ends, and where you were able to locate it. I looked for one in the past 
&gt; but was quoted such high prices I gave up.thanks.
Hi ronnie,

I bought it at archway imported car parts here in Saint Louis MO.  It was
$49.95.  Their number is 314-638-7700 and they do mail order.  They are
closed sunday and monday.

take care,

Steve
