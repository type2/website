Subject: Re: [VB] Rust on spindle

&gt;  My plan is to treat the area
&gt;with muriatic acid or something similar

rust-converters/acids are not recommended for 'critical' parts...
brakes,running gear, etc. &quot;hydrogen embrittlement&quot; occurs when the carbon
bonds in the steel are infiltrated by hydrogen in the acid, causing weak
spots in the crystal latice, which can then crack the part
catastrophically.

having said that, i slathered ospho all over my running gear over 10 years
ago - before i knew about this! -  and nothing has broken so far. i'm
guessing if you flew a jet, you'd keep the stuff away.  still, i'd try
steel wool and wd-40 first, or por-15. if you use an acid, use as little as
possible, like with a small paintbrush.

i've gotten several rattle cans of high-zinc primer at my local hardware
store; i'd use that if you don't feel like por-1$.
