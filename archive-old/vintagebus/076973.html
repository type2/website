&gt; By crossing the starter contacts I am able to start the engine.  Is this 
&gt; the correct way to do this?  Do I need to hook up the generator?  Is this safe?

Hi Jon,
That will work to start it up.  You need to hook up the generator if it is 
the type without the regulator bolted on top of it.  Running a generator without 
a regulator will result in a burnt out generator in less than a minute!  As 
far as safe it depends on how you are going to supply it with fuel and secure 
it so it does not fall off a shelf for instance.  Do have a fire extinguisher 
handy and if it is the dry powder make sure the powder inside it is not caked!  
If you can not get a sandy swoosh when you turn it upside down you need to 
pound it with a rubber hammer till it does.
