We hashed this out a few weeks ago, and the general consensus is that
some people like it, some people don't.  It would be kinda rash to
filter 'ebay' at the server level.    I'm trying to convince people
to keep the items to &quot;interesting&quot; and unusual stuff, but that's
like herding cats.

The solution?  Filter ebay with your email program.  I think every
email client out there can be set up to filter messages based on
content or sender.

One complaint I've heard a couple of times about the ebay posts is
that it tips people's hands with regards to stuff they were going to
bid on, and now they have competition.  Well, I don't know what I can
do about that.
