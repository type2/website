Subject: Vintage VW Calendars

Dear Listees:

I stopped by the local dealer today and got ahold of the parts guy who
owes me a favor....and finally got more of the vintage calendars. I
know, the year is already nearly 1/4th over, but if you would like a
calendar, and can't get one locally, drop me a check for $3.20 at
 
Jack maynard
860 NW Van Buren #2
Corvallis OR 97330

$3.20 is my cost for mailing them, and you get two. I have 20 or so, so
let me know when you are mailing the check and I will ear mark a couple
for you.

Also: I owe a calendar to someone named Taylor. I think there are
several Taylors on the list. You know who you are. Re send me your snail
and I will send you one gratis.
