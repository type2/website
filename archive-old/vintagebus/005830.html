Man - it just ain't fair.  I can't believe they junk stuff like this.  The
floor even had paint on it!

I'm kind of hoping that when I run out to Cali next year, that I can find
rust free bus.  I'll just hook it up to Daisy, tow it home, and move all the
parts from Daisy into the new bus and save my the expense of lots of body
work.  Well maybe. :-)
