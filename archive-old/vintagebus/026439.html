Hi Rich.
No, you're not having a &quot;short bus moment&quot;.  What happens when you jack
up the rear of your bus and support it from the frame and not the rear
suspension?  The suspension gets extended.  When you extend the rear
suspension, you stress the tranny boot and somewhere along the way it
leaks.  I'm assuming you use the replacement bolt together type.  Mine
do that.  The only recommendation I can make is to loosen the outer
clamp a bit and try to slide the boot end towards the transmission just
a bit to relieve the stress.  Then tighten the clamp (important).  When
I install those boots now I push them towards the tranny slightly to
achieve this.
Dave
