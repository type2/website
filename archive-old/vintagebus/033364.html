Hi everyone,
To start off, I searched the archives and no luck.
I am getting really crappy gas mileage in my 63 deluxe.
Roughly 13 mpg on the freeway. I'm only able to make it around 140 miles per 
tank at 70 mph
I have a 1600dp with a 009 and 30 pic w/ satock oil bath. Stock bus trans.
Choke is adjusted but plugs still come out black.
Do I need carb work, new jets, float, choke
I have installed new plugs, wires, valve adjustment, etc...
This is getting to be dissapointing expecially as I plan to drive to Southern 
Ca for the Classic in a few weeks. I'd really like to make it without 
stopping ecvery two hours for gas.
Can anyone offer any good suggestions

13 mph is bad.  Have you done a compression check?   

I re jetted my 30-pict carb on the 1600sp in my 65 westy and swapped the 009 
for a 010 dist a friend gave me and get 22 or 23 mpg now, up a few. from 19 
or 20 when the motor was in the other bus hopelessly unscientific I know also 
get better milage when cruising at 3K rpms than higher or lower.   And I am 
not making this up to convert people, just sharing.     

do take your carb apart and figure out what jets you have .  I like 30-pict, 
but change jets and it acts differnt.  Ericof veewee111 has a nifty tool that 
checks whether the jets are what size, then tend not to be the size they say 
(how unusual).  okay I think I have a 120 main jet (the one on the side by 
the accelerator cable)  (though i am told 116 is ideal i have a 120 in there 
and it is better that others, but I also have a 120 that bogs it out that I 
should sacrifice to the Gods) and a 135ish  air correction jet that's the 
long thing screws down into the bottom of the carb you get to the screw by 
taking its lid off, lots of holes like a flute or some such)  though I was 
running a 135 before. that actually was 125  and it seemed fine too.
