 I have looked at the later, post '67 Westy camper kits and that same
 cabinet is included in it too.  It looks very much the same with only some
 subtle changes.  Those are more common out here in Seattle, and cheaper
 too.  Just an idea to mull around...

Actually, we are sending a '71 to the junkyard. It looks to have a pretty 
compete West interior. I didn't look at it that close, so I'm not sure if 
it's the same as a Split or not. I'll probably grab the rear seat before the 
&quot;hook&quot; shows up.
