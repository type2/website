Subject: quick rear bench seat question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have an early rear bench seat with original caramel
brown upholstery (1960-61?). Inside the bus, facing
front with the driver's side being the right side, the
right most leg of this bench seat is bent inward in
back. Is this to clear the spare tire well on a
walk-thru? I have a front bench seat, so I can't tell.
 I'm selling this seat and I want to make sure iot's
not bent, Never seen a rear bench seat leg bent like
this, but then again, I haven't seen many rear bench
seat legs (sounds like how much wood could a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood - LOL) 

Thanks,
Jason
