&gt; The recent talk about propane heaters has raised a question in my weak
&gt; mind... Has anyone had trouble getting the fuel out of the bottle at 10
&gt; or 20 degrees F? I know my BBQ won't perform at those temps, I believe
&gt; the gas condenses too much to provide the req'd pressure to leave the
&gt; bottle! This would preclude the effective use of a propane furnace of
&gt; any type here in Montana when you needed it most!
&gt; Anyone have personal experience on this?

Low temperatures slow the vaporization of propane in the bottles.  Bulk
propane suppliers compensate for this by increasing the amount of propane
in the propane/butane LPG mix so it will evapoarate at lower temperatures.

Unfortunately, pre-bottled propane doesn't have that advantage.  It has to
be the same for the entire country, so folks in cold places will have to
keep their bottles warm for them to work.
