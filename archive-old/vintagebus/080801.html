&gt; Primer alone is not the answer Ron.

The POR company instructions show how to use fiberglas material, with POR
to cover holes in structures. They don't recommend this for structural
strength, or for top surfaces, but for underside parts that need to be
protected from rust. I've used the method to cover access holes that I've
drilled in my frame, where I sprayed POR inside the channels. It works.

Nothing takes the place of doing the metal work. Ask Metwiz on this list.

POR, when used intelligently and carefully, is uniquely useful for
protecting cars against rusting. I used  lots of it during my two - year
restoration back in 94-95, and no rust has occurred anywhere I used it,
including the battery tray area, bumpers, and the wheelwells.

Nitrile gloves are essential, as is a organic-vapor-rated aspirator mask.
The sprayer needs to be cleaned every 20 minutes with the POR thinner or
fast acrylic laquer thinner (PSL7002). You can thin it up to 20% with
their thinner.
