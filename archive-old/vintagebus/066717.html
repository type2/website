Subject: A neat thing I want to share

    While cleaning my bus seats today(thanks for the advice claralw_at_aol_dot_com),
I found some paper stuffed up in the seats, It was some previous owners mail.
So i looked him up at whitepages_dot_com......I found the address and phone
number, dialed it not expecting the bus owner to still be at that number. Well
he wasn't, but it was his parents house. He no longer lived with them. But his
wife was there and we talked about the bus quite a bit. They even think that
they might still have some of the parts up in the attic!!
Such a neat day.....
john
