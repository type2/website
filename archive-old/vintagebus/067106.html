with a Westy so42  walkthru kit installed by TEC.Bus and kit came over 
separately and kit installed in 65. Has theTEC badge on the pop top and a 65 
Westfalia badge inside.We know it was a U.S. conversion because there are 
nonotches on the A pillar for the child cot brackets and noelectrical outlet 
in the back or inside. Also, no indication inthe mcode for camper set up. It 
also only has one crank outwindow one each side. The molding around the 
poptop hole is different than factory.I guess it was faster to order separate 
than getting on the waiting list forafactory Westy. I don't know if this was 
done by the dealer and soldoff the lot, or if it was done by the 
customer.Larry
