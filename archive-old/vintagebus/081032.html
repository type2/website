Subject: RE: [VB] RE: oil temp.

&gt;A type three oil cooler in the doghouse with an electric oil temp sender
&gt;in place of the original oil pressure light switch should be a good
&gt;place to get near correct oil temps. The front of the doghouse tine will
&gt;have to have a hole drilled to allow the installation of the sensor, but
&gt;it seems like a good plan to me. Anyone tried that?
&gt;
&gt;Ray


yup, me. most days in phoenix, the oil temp OUT of the cooler never 
goes above 150. when i stop after a prolonged run (at a light, say) 
and the fan speed goes down, you can see the oil temps climb rapidly 
to 180.
head temps have mysteriously gone from an average of 350 to near 400, 
and i need to see if it is the gauge or for real.....
