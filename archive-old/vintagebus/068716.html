&gt; i cant find this vent in the front and the only thinf i found behind the 
&gt; seat was a number in the medal.  it is cut off cause somebody tried to giv 
&gt; this thing civic seats. they look sick but they cut the medal wall behind 
&gt; the seat.the number on the wall is 0446 and the rest is cut off.

Greetings,
The ID plate on the front vent is only on 1964 and later buses.  Plus any 
plates could have been easily unscrewed and replaced.  You will have to 
replace the cut out sheet metal behind the seats to get them from dumping you 
backward in an accident and probably turning you into a paraplegic!

i tried to look in the back where the motor is but i cant it the hood open.it 
looks like 
&gt; the handel is broke and i cant turn it,it kinda looks like the one on my 
&gt; homies bug but only broken in 2.

You need a square key for opening the gas and engine lids.  You can get a 
cheapie repro from Wolfsburg West _at_:

For now you might open it with a slot tip screwdriver if the lock is not 
rusted badly.  Once in there use a wire brush to remove the rust coving the 
ID # stamped there.
