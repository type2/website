i emailed him and he said his excuse for the poor desription was ignorance,
that he did not know that there was not supposed to be a big groove and the
oval shaped dowel pin hole in the main journal,   then he said i should have
asked him by email the condition (the same description as the ebay listing)
is what i would have got,   that was NO SIGNS OF WEAR.    in his email he
said as is no refunds.

&gt; What's been his reply about this if any at all?  I returned an item (not
&gt; from him) because it was not as advertised and informed the seller by
&gt; e-mail.  Did not hear a word and then one day I get a check in the mail
with
&gt; a copy of my e-mail.  No feedback, nothing.  But at least I got my money
&gt; back.
