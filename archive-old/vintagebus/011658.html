Subject: Maiden Voyage my 63 EZ camper

With that other GM car sold, I had to push with extra effort on Saturday and
Sunday in order to get the '63 ready for daily usage by Tuesday (today).
Drove the GM to the credit union for the final fundage/paperwork thing.

Today I set off sailing in the unfamiliar '63 on the freeways of Phoenix.
(Welcome to El Lay!) I was used to an hour of Howard Stern and A/C at 70
MPH. Today it was engine noise, hot wind, at 52-55. Geez, a 1600 DP oughta
go faster than that I thought. Yet, I had never really driven a small nut
tranny. The commute and work day was eventually completed. 
A local shop helped eliminate a few of the problems and freshman mistakes
that I had made. Silly me, trying to use a vintage vacuum advance dizzy and
static timing. The poor 30-1 wasnt set up to snuff either. Darn!, I thought
that I used to be able to set 'em up better than that!
Oh well~ the results is that another splittie is on the road and running in
fine fashion. Look for me in the white bus with green bumper &lt;ft only&gt;, red
driver's door that squeaks like a ship wreck, wheels of various sizes and
hues, and a fine Rex Eastman supplied 3/4 rack. =)
It really looks like Joseph's coat of many colors.
