Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?

Ronnie writ:
&gt;You also should use the Porsche nut (18.10) and the shims are different.
Also if you mention a club, or just about anything they will generally give
10% off&lt;

I was wondering about the nut.  I have to assume that the threads are the
same and all that.  The one big question is that the VW spacer and nut kind
of offset it to the rear, ensuring that the end of the generator shaft
threads do not bind, where the Porsche nut might bind/bottom out on the
generator shaft when fully tight..?

Glad you can verify the shims are different (I would be pissed if I paid $1
each for regular VW shims).

... I need to remember the discount thing :)  You are right that normally
PCA members get a discount all over the place if you ask...  Granted I let
my membership lapse because it is basically worthless to join in my opinion
(unless you like wine and cheese social BS - I like grease).


Take Care,
