Subject: Broken exhaust studs

While assembling the engine for my '65 single cab I managed to break two of
the rear exhaust studs, one on each head.  It happened when I was fitting
the muffler on and then needed to remove it.  Seems that those swaged 13mm
hex M8 copper nuts don't like to come back off like the 12mm hex kind that
have the slice in them.  I was able to remove the broken pieces from the
heads but the threads got a little chewed and the replacement studs have
more play in the holes than normal so I ordered an M8-1.25 kit from the
Time-Sert people for $48.  It should be here early next week.  My question
is to those with experience using time-serts to repair stripped threads.
Did you do the repair with the part in place (using an electric hand drill)
or remove the part and drill it out in a drill press?  I'm not really in a
position to remove the heads right now.  Any tips for a successful repair?
Should I use locktight on the insert?

Thanks,

Thomas
