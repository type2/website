If memory serves me, and pushing 37 it fails with frustrating regularity, the
one with the square box with ribbed straight sides was $300 or was it
$600...like I said the memory ;-)

Don't forget the double cab rack for a buck and a half (told the wife and she
said why didn't you buy it?  Didn't want to tell her I'm saving for a 600
dollar tent :-) and the big rubber tub full of deluxe bumper trim.  I saw Greg
there with a friend grabbing a few.  Didn't ask prices since those deeeeelux
thingies are way too fancy for me ;-)

I picked up a complete dog house with thermo rod, flaps, springs and flap
connecting rod for $20 (the guy even spray bombed it black, ohhhh), a mostly
complete 6V BN4 for $10 and a nice but dirty 40 hp bus only dist. for
$5(someone was selling a clean one for $50).  The heater t needs a top cover.
If nothing else, its worth the parts.  The motor runs so I'm happy.  Anyone
have a top cover for a BN4?  Anyone heard of a 6V BN4...I thought they were all
12V?  I'm only versed in the very early 6V heaters (55/56 types).

Sounds like I should start spending the night.  Most of the good stuff goes
Sat. night?
