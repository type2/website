Subject: Re: [VB] Door opening on the move?!?!?!?

If the mechanism latched fine before the new rubber, but not afterwards, I 
would wonder if it had closed and latched fully.  

or the rubber could be putting pressure on it.

does it latch into the 2nd position?   Don't trim the rubber.  eventually it 
with squish down.

Oh, look at an original rubber bus, and see re trimming for where the pieces 
overlap.  Cut large, they do shrink.   If you don't have access to an 
original rubbber bus, I can take pics and p mail them to you.


I have now and then found mechs that either did not keep the door closed or 
did not open, but that was with buses that had sat for ages.  Never had one 
die on me, but if that mechanism failed, you would have to replace it- the 
part that the outer handle goes to- the part the inner handle goes to only 
seem to mess up when someone loses the inner handle and uses vice grips 
inside, which chaws up the splines

&lt;&lt; Hey gang,
 
 I installed new door rubber in my double cab this weekend and later when I 
went for a spin the passenger door swung open on its own.  When I got home 
and inspected the lock mechanism, it seems to work fine but the latch part 
isn't fully locking out to catch the door jamb.  The door does seem to sit a 
little less flush than it did before the new rubber (it had no rubber though 
before I installed this rubber).  If I trim down the rubber will this help?  
I was nervous to do this because I don't want to loose the seal and let in 
water/air.  Does a '63 inside door handle have a &quot;locked&quot; position, or just 
open and close?
