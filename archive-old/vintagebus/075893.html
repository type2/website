Hi Eric,
Torsion bars to be of spring quality have to be heat treated to such a 
hardness that precludes cutting them with any sawing, or shearing.  In other 
words the saw would slide across without cutting like a butter knife trying 
to cut glass and shearing will only result in shattering the material.  The 
only way to cut them is with a grinding device.  The problem with grinding is 
the hardened part must be cooled repeatedly and often with water or some 
other type of liquid cutting coolant.  If the part is not cooled the steel 
will show a blue tint and the hardening of the steel throughout that area 
will be compromised!
