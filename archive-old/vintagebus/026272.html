In my humble opinion,
            While you have the front end torn apart,I'd change all worn out
parts! Make sure to check the center or pivot pin.
    Also I run my 64 with the Sway Away brand front anti sway bar and the rear
camber compensator, and I love it!!!
It makes the bus much safer and more responsive in the turns and in the high
winds here in the Great Plains.. Downside, the camber compensator will wear
your front trans. mount out a bit sooner, but I feel it's a small price to pay
for staying on the road.Again, only my opinion! Your not molesting the bus by
putting them on , they unbolt in minutes.

               Good luck,
                            woody


ps.I have been running the KYB GR2's and I'm not sold on them.Too stiff for my
old body.I'm going back to Boge's, I think.Anybody have any ideas on shocks?
Obviously I do enjoy &quot;some&quot; performance.

&gt; I recently spoke to a gentleman that drove a 1965 bus for about twelve
&gt; years. When he purchased it in the mid 80s it had EMPI antisway bars
&gt; installed on the front and rear. He stated that the bus handled like no
&gt; other had ever owned. Anyone install an aftermarket antisway setup?Is it
&gt; worth it and is now the time to do it while other front end work is being
&gt; handled?
