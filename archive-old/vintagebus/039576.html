I have a dilema. i am about to repair my corners and only found some 57's 
for my 58' d.d.panel i am real tempted to make a 57 out of my 58. i like the 
older lights but i am not a big fan of hacks or customs, this bus is a 
resurection and couldnt be worse than when i found it, just checking the vw 
world for some advise, to the extreme i was also considering adding some 
semaphores and smoothing my nose. i just dont want to insult my bus with 
extreme hacks, i just have the older and older disease where no matter what 
the year i want the one previous.
cool
zac
