I figured most of it out using the NEATO site, but I had a couple
&gt; of questions about the paint codes.  Here is the entire tag:
&gt; 
&gt; 30 9
&gt; 361 B35
&gt; SZ 2311 523622 1176847
&gt; 
-

Built 30 september 
 ( from the specifications and mods book) 

M361 was a package of options...
including M168, 181, 192, 199
168: 88amp-hour battery, 6v
181: Woo woo! Chrome Hubcaps
192: Body made to be outfitted as a camper
199: Seat belt mounting points fitted

The B35 is most likely a SO-35 westy with optional extra equipment (?) 
Listed is a &quot;B42&quot; which is an SO-42 with pop-up top, side tent and roof
rack. So from there I can extrapolate... If it was a flip seat, probably
not a pop, but maybe it had a roof rack and tent?

SZ is switzerland, like you said
2311 model 23 ( kombi) 11 paint finish ( laquer?) 

523622 523 should be upper color, 622 lower, but I cant find any matches
to these codes...might ry Thom's vintagebus registry, it is a good
source for these...or wolfsburg west's page

1176847 should be chassis # without first two digits....
 Thats all I got...
