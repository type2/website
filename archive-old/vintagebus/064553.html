Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

Hello All   Lets not get carried away, BMW did exactly what VW did on the 
trademark about 8 years ago. Also did they produce the number of vehicles 
that VW did? Is there as large of a following?  I don't think so. We can only 
hope VW wises up but I won't hold my breath. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
