Subject: Remote Email question (kind of VW related actually)
Date: Sat, 3 Mar 2001 15:29:39 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

This message technically isn't a VW post however, I strongly believe that my
question is something that many of you have wondered about in the past.  It
is VW related if you take into account that if we drive our VWs someplace,
we often find ourselves without email access.

I use Outlook Express 5.0 and I have it setup to check for email every 10
minutes due to the amount of pictures and high bandwidth emails I deal with.
What I would love to be able to do is get on the net remotely and telnet
into my personal computer (hooked via DSL) and read the email that my
machine has downloaded.  It would involve a telnet client of some sort that
would use the main master email file that outlook express is using (which is
basically a huge text file).  The idea would be that I could read my emails
and reply to them.  The program would automatically stick my composed
message in my outbox and email it within 10 minutes.  As a plus, I would
like to be remotely able to control my email such as deleting, forwarding,
etc. but I would be tickled pink if I could just read and reply to emails
from my personal machine so that I could post to the lists about my VW
travels while I'm out on the road.

If anyone knows of some software like this, I'd sure like to know where to
down it, buy it, etc.

I'm thinking there are those of you out there who have often wondered the
same thing.

If I'm grossly out of line asking this, please let me know.  I think it's
relevant and thank goodness I didn't ask any questions about banjos this
time right? :-)
