  dipstick oil temp...

re oil weight used, I put a filter pump (an oil pump that takes a screw on  
filter) on the engine in my 65, and had to switch to a thinner oil as that  
pump is much heavier duty (makes more pressure.) With 30 wt in winter I  blew a 
filter one frozen morning (a filter with the internal bypass spring!) Now  that 
engine gets 10/30, which has been fine on cold mornings and even cruising  
the central valley in CA in summer.   (bus has an oil pressure  gauge)
