&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 I'm debating on buying a *decent* 71 single cab ($1,000), should I save my 
 money for a split window double or single cab?  (ie what do yins guys like 
 better?)  (I would prefer a splity)

You call that a crisis, man I knew I never shoulda opened this mail, I 
thought you really needed help. I think YOU should get a late model. Never 
cry wolf.
