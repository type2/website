While some people sat home and paintshopped buses into BYU parking lot =
pictures instead of driving a couple of hours to Jerome,  other people =
went to the show and had a great time.  All sorts of interesting things =
happened. Terrible two's were in full force with their  &quot;club =
initiation&quot; hence the man walking around with butterfly wings and a =
leopard speedo. I swear that club is just like a sorority, and going to =
their campsite is a 'must do' at every show. A guy pulled up in a old =
skool school bus with a splitty welded to the top, hopped out and =
started making glass pipes in the back of it, very nice. Seems like all =
of the sudden i see school buses with splittys welded to the top =
everywhere...There was another one parked in the town of jerome that I =
had never seen, and theres also another yellow one with a green vanagon =
welded to the top, over by my work. Anyway back to Jerome- The typical =
clueless man risked his life to climb the forbidden hill, and was almost =
burned at the stake when he got down. I think they should tell everyone =
&quot;dont go on the forbidden hill&quot; right when you drive thru the gate, that =
way nobody can say they 'didnt know'. Then a while later I was standing =
talking to a local vintage nut, when another guy walked up and started =
freaking out about some swap stuff (some jalousey windows) which he =
thought he should be entitled to buy  instead of the man who was there =
before him...? The guy got very violent and punched my friends rare =
factory double door standard ragtop(which won best unrestored split), it =
left a small dent... Drugs are a wonderful thing arent they? I think =
someone in the Terrible two's won the raffle single cab since after it =
was raffled off, it was filled with club memebers in the back as they =
did a victory lap around the campsite. Earl brought his #176 binz out to =
the show, sporting a Busware=AE canopy, I took plenty of detailed pics =
of that for those who wanted to see close ups. Also my friend made up =
some lower gate replacement pieces, for all those gates that are nice =
but have the lower channel rusted out and had them on display at the =
show. They are exactly like the og's with the correct bends. Pics of =
those are here:
http://dropgates_dot_com/gallery/search.php?searchstring=3DNew+reproduction
If you want to buy some, see the classifieds area of my site. I think =
ronnie is also going to buy a bunch from him and start carrying them.

 I traveled to the show and back with no problems except having to =
retard my timing a slight bit,  although a friend of mine had recently =
bought a 62 DC from a listmember (had no engine so i guess he pulled one =
of another VW he had) and had the alternator fry on the way up, then the =
engine overheated on the way back and locked up after it was shutoff. He =
went to look and saw gas was gushing out the sides of the carbs as well =
and in the process of looking at that, saw that the fuel pump was =
pumping practically nothing. He replaced the fuel pump, rebuilt the carb =
and went to take off, couldnt get back up past 35mph and then BOOM there =
goes a rod out the side of the case. .... Fun filled times for him.

will have pics of the canopy and a few jerome pics up later tonight
