Jerome is not only a religion but a way of life. Once
attended you will be sucked into the cult. It's
basically a celebration of the end of Hell for the
Phoenicians...
We *do* promote love offerings (charitable
contributions) at the event. Last year I even gave an
&quot;altar call~ come to Jesus&quot; sermon from the stage to
support the needs of a bus brother. The congregation
responded with religious zeal. The congregation
regularly raises &quot;prophet&quot; to support the needs of
younger Saints in their journeys.
Your prayers for just the right raffle prize may be
answered if you buy enough alms.
Elder Garcia and his followers have sung about
expecting a miracle every day...

All VW believers are welcome at our church. Camping in
within the holy of holies otherwise known as the
&quot;Promised land&quot; requires that you arrive in a VW. The
land has been promised from the beginning of time for
VWs only. (Its a covenant theology) Limited space for
pagans and potential converts in the area closer to
the Spirit Room. (You gotta know Jerome to get that
joke). Very few virgins are sacrificed (excepting
VWFOOL_at_aol_dot_com) and fire pits/burning bushes are NOT
encouraged especially in light of this year's ungodly
wild fire season. Responsible small fire
shrines/lighting of candles have been allowed if well
attended. Our church embraces song and dancing as long
as you can manage to maintain drumming in 4/4 time and
take a vow of silence at the appropriate hour.
Blasting Judas Priest past 10:30-11PM doesn't get it!
Embracing in the spirit of family or the spirits that
your family brings has been known to happen. Do not
count on acting like the Devil or raising more hell
than the general tribe. Those persons possessed with
demons of thumping music, climbing on the rocks of
ages, smoating of rock, empowered by crystal visions,
stickiness of fingers or fists of cuffs will be
immediately crucified en mass.
Jerome is located very near the Sedona Vortex so pray
about it and make the commitment to attend. You know
what to do now... Your conscience is tenderly calling~
calling you home... We'll sing one more verse and
encourage you to come on up front now... You know in
your heart that it is the right thing to do... Answer
your calling before all is damned! Avoid the wailing
and gnashing of teeth. In the blink of an eye it will
be over. The end is near.
