Subject: sundail windows
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i have a 61 panel that was fitted with sundail inteior. Im gona restore the 
interior but am thinking of pulling the sundail windows out. Does any one 
know if there is any need for such windows, and if they are worth anything. I 
have 5 of them, two are missing the guids. The other three are in great 
working shape. I guess they are just some camper windows that are smaller 
then any ive seen before.
