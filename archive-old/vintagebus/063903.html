Subject: ruthmann speed control rebuild... Brake cylinder type

Hi All,

I was working on the v80 last night, trying to get the speed control to work
correctly so I can swing the boom around without getting whiplash.  The
system works using a pedal in the bucket that operates a brake master
cylinder bolted under the bucket.  This operates a slave cylinder near the
solenoids that either makes it go faster or slower... we haven't got that
far yet.  Anyway, after messing around with it and cleaning up the fluid
reservoir in the bucket, we came to the conclusion that the master cylinder
needs to be rebuilt.  It appears to be an ATE brand (as written on the
reservoir).  Can anyone help id the mc so I know what to order?  (i.e.
either a kit if available or a new cylinder).

For pics and a better explanation:

TIA
