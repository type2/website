Subject: RE: [VB] Engine sealant-found some good stuff

&gt; &quot;Thick as toothpaste&quot; and &quot;never hardens&quot;, that sounds scary! Especially
&gt; around the case where tolerance is critical. Permatex 3-H is as close to the
&gt; factory sealant that I've found and I have never had a problem with it in the
&gt; last 33 years.

I note that the Mexican engines come with what looks suspiciously like
Hylomar on their case joints.

&gt; It is the case sealant of choice for high performance engines
&gt; like Lycoming and Continental aircraft motors which are also air cooled.

At 0.5 HP/in^3 these aren't exactly high performance.  They're right in
line with a type 1 VW!
