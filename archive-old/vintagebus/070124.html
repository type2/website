Subject: Re: [VB] bus update

if you follow this link you will see the pop-out frames that are on their way
http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com/cgi-bin/shop/web_store.cgi?page=popouts.html&amp;cart_id=6853676_29626

the frames as most other things creative makes is T6 aluminum, which is you
ask me is better than stainless steel, but my old ones are nasty with
corrosion so as long as the rust dies who cares right?

     and
  Clementine

I'll let you know how they fit when they get here.

material (hopefully stainless steel) they are?
Thanks!
