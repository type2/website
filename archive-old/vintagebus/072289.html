Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter rod boot on tranny?

yes, there is a dust boot that goes over the end of the nose come where the 
hockey stick pokes out.   

There is also a seal in the end of the nose cone that is supposed to keep the 
tranny oil inside the tranny.

There were also dust seals at the end of the tube the shift rod goes through, 
and at the ends of the heater cable tubes.   

available through the usual parts sources. ASAIK

As long as the tranny is out, might as well makes sure all the engine 
compartment seals and grommets are good, replace the fuel line, shift bushings, etc.

 Is there a boot or something on the tranny shift rod?
 
 This is the thing sticking out the front of the tranny
 that goes to the shift coupler.
 
 My old tranny didn't have one, but the older tranny
 I'm putting (why would I freak if I said sonething
 like this about my now departed Honda, but its ok for
 my bus?!?!) seems suspicously clean in this area, &gt;&gt;
