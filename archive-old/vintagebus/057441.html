Subject: RE: [VB] Duralube/215,000 miles

&gt; I have no clue, just trying to figure out if the duralube contibuted to the
&gt; longevity of the engine or is it just good maintainance

So you put duralube now?
Its like trying to do whatever the 110 year old man did thinking youll
live that long. I think hes just one of the lucky ones.
Luck combined with decent maint  and reasonable driving habits.
