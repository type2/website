&gt; If you look at the stampings, it looks like the round mirror that I just
got
&gt; from Wolfsburg whom claimed they were NOS!... however, the VW stamp is
quite
&gt; blurred and there is also some form of yin-yang symbol as well.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody have an original so we all know what should be stamped on it????
&gt;
Those ones on eBay look the same as some originals I have, stamping and all,
from what is visible.  Didn't someone say the repros have an incomplete VW
stamp to avoid copyright problems?

1 of my originals has the part # stamping offset such that the part # is off
the edge a little, must have been a production mistake.  That's an original
Barndoor one too, they were probably doing it by hand back then.  ;(
