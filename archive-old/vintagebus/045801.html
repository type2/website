Subject: loud banging noise
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My bus has started making a very loud banging or rumbling noise when in gear .
this noise is in all gears and stops when clutch is engaged. I checked the 
tranny fluid and its full but did not drain it yet. Visually checked mounts 
and see nothing
wrong. all bolts in tranny and reduction boxes tight. Could this mean that 
the 
tranny is toast or is it the reduction boxes or rear wheel bearings. Ihave no 
loss
of forward momentum when driving and don't feel anything wroug except for the
extremely loud noise. I checked the archives but did not see anything similar
to this problem. Would  appreciate your feedback. Thanks Jim    66 Westy
