Hey folks,
I'm looking to find out the compatibility of shifter parts on my 58.
I took out the old screeching front shift rod support that had no bushing.
It has a smaller hole for the rod and a spring on the  support that pushes
down on the rod.  I replaced it with the newer type support and found that I
had no reverse.  Looking at it, the shifter was not able to come down far
enough under the lockout plate.  I got the newer larger style lockout plate
and still the same thing.  If I loosen up the two bolts it will go into
reverse fine.  I thought hey, I could just leave it like that.:)  My
solution is to put washer(s) in between the shift support and the underside
of the floorpan possibly giving some more room to get under the lockout
plate.  Any comments?   The parts I am dealing with:
Original 58 shifter (small ball and socket?)
Original 58 lever retainer and spring.
Original 58 front shift rod.
Newer style lockout plate
New shift rod support and new bushing.

Am I missing some part I am unaware of?  The Bentley (the 64-67 one)
mentioned something about changing shift plates when changing the shift
support, so I did that.  The old shift plate was kind of chewed up some
anyway.

Thanks for any enlightenment.


John
