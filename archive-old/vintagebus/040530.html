&gt;Besides the good reason that Eric&amp;Barb gave (trend indication),
&gt;you can also get that kewl racing look by rotating the gauge
&gt;in the mounting so that the needle points straight up when all
&gt;is well.  That way you just have to glance at the gauges for
&gt;any needles that are not standing straight up.  :)
&gt;
Assuming that you mount your gauges side by side (left to right),an even 
better way of orienting the gauges is to turn them all so that when &quot;all's 
well&quot; with the gauge, the needle points at the 9:00 position, instead of the 
12:00 position.  That way, the needles of the side by side gauges form a 
straight line one with another.  The &quot;all's well&quot; 12:00 position is correct 
if the gauges are mounted one above the other, for the same reasons.  It's 
easier to take a glance at a bank of gauges and see the continuity of the 
needles making a straight line one with another.  if there is an aberrent 
reading in one of the gauges, you know immediately which one, cuz it's 
screwing up your nice straight line.  I'm in an ergonomics course this 
semester, and this is supposedly how they orient all the gauges in them 
nuclear power plants.  There have been studies conducted that have shown 
that people can detect aberrations in gauge readings more rapidly than in 
other configurations.  And that's why you have the gauges in the first 
place, no?

Drawback is that it's a bit harder to read the numbers on the gauge, but if 
you've already got the gauges off-kilter to get the needle to stand straight 
up you've already got that problem.  Try it, and see what works best for 
you.
