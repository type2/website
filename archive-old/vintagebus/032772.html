Subject: identify this noise
Message-ID: &lt;429056cf.24bcdd26_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

     after my radio shorted out about a week ago.. i started hearing i noise 
that was not there before...
 it is in the trans because it stops the second i put in the clutch. the 
noise is a sort of high pitched humm that starts when i put it in third grear 
and accelerate. if i stop accelerating the noise ceases. it continues into 
fourth gear until about 55mph where it dissapears.. could this be a gear 
problem in the transaxle? a CV joint or reduction box problem.. 

any help would be appreciated..
