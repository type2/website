&lt;&lt; How would one go about cleaning a westfalia tent? &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
We lay out a large new poly tarp on the lawn and on top of this a piece of 
the tent down to clean it with dish soap and warm water.  Once soaped up we 
just use a garden hose with spray nozzle to rinse well.  Then hang the tent 
as a unit on the bus to dry well.  This turned our rat infested tent into a 
very clean one that looked new except for the two holes in the side pieces 
you could throw a cat through.  Eric&amp;Barb
