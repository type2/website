       Just my two cents worth.  Stock or custom, does it really matter?  
Back in my body shop days, I had the opportunity to work on everything from 
Hot Rods (a blown Model A comes to mind--hell to start-easier to push) to 
brand new BMWs.  It was a pay check, custom or stock.  But when I'd get home 
I'd head for the workshop and to work on one of my VW's.  Most of the other 
employees thought I was nuts!! (what's new) &quot;Why?&quot; they would ask.  The only 
answer I have ever needed is &quot;there fun!!&quot;  Thats all that matters, okay, 
maybe three cents worth.
                                                                       Peace,
                                                                           
Frank--heading for the workshop for some fun!!!!
