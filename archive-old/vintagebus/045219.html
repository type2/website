 I'm fairly sure that there are two different tank styles.  Not separate from 
the walk through/bench differences.  One is like you have and the other is a 
threaded top that accepts a threaded cap.  I've never seen originals.  What 
year is your Westy?

my 65 bench seat westy has the two tab cap, not the threaded cap.
