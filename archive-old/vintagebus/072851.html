Subject: Bus &amp; Bug owners wanted!

With tomorrow's holiday, today kind of feels like
Friday, and I have seen a couple of recent questions
regarding bug issues, so here goes: Did you know that
there is a Bug equivalent of the Type2 List??  This is
a list, which is growing every day, for TECHNICAL
discussions about the Type 1.  There are VERY MANY bug
enthusiasts sites out there, and THIS IS NOT ONE OF
THEM. The list is modeled after the T2 &amp; VB lists, and
basically use the same rules and etiquette in the bus
lists charters.  There are a LOT of people on the
VWType 1 list that own BOTH buses (mandatory bus
content!)and bugs, and this is a great asset! Anyway,
goto http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwtype1list
and sign up today.
