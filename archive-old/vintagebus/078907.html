Hi Harry --

There are a few of us in the Philly area -- I guess we just tend to be
lurkers! Welcome to the area. I see the occassional &quot;bay&quot; bus around, and
there are a few of us with older split-windshield buses. Mine's in the
garage right now with an obscure reduction gearbox leak (see separate post).
There's a fellow in Philadelphia with several &quot;splits,&quot; a woman in
Norristown was just trying to sell her bay camper on this list, and of
course you're in the neighborhood of The Bus Depot.

I was in Ocean City this weekend, and came across a red &amp; white '65 with
cut-out rear wheelwells and big tires mounted on white steel star wheels. It
seems to live at the fire house there. In past years I've seen a yellow &amp;
white &quot;bay&quot; down there that's well-kept, but haven't seen it there this
year. Keep your eyes open...

-- Rich
