Subject: Re: Long block vs turnkey

&gt; From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; If you can not or do not have the time to build an engine  
&gt; yourself.   Get the
&gt; longblock and put all the parts on yourself.  That way the engine   
&gt; will have
&gt; that much less mystery in your future when you need to work  on it!!
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb

Amen to that.  A few years back I was debating these options and the  
listees helped convince me to build one myself.  Still running (knock  
wood).  Required very few special tools -- I think I only had to find  
a dial indicator (for end play) and ring compressor, and there are  
ways around that.  I had a shop do the heads complete.  Used the  
teardown as an excuse to buy a clicker torque wrench and a few other  
tools and still came out ahead.  And I didn't even have an engine  
stand (though I recommend one).

I understand hesitation over doing the full teardown.  A longblock is  
IMO better than a turnkey.  As E&amp;B say, you'll know the engine  
better.  You can save $ if you can find some junked motors to get a  
lot of the ancillaries off of.

Good luck!
