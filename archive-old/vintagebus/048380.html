Subject: New German Side Tents $295.00
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just received a shipment of Komet side tents and these are the lowest 
priced tents I have ever offered.  I had the Komet tent in the past, but it 
was over $400.  This is the same tent, but I bought these direct from the 
manufacturer and a very good exchange rate.  You can only find the Komet and 
other new tents on my online shopping cart at www.eurocampers_dot_com

P-mail with any questions.
