Ouch, hard to get happy after that. No need to regret helping. The quality
of the recipient has no bearing on the quality of the help. You did okay, he
punked you. How can I put this nicely. It's kind of like a person with
saber-toothed crotch crickets. Once they give them to you, you won't go out
with them again. Once everyone knows they're sporting tiny livestock, they
spend a lot of quiet nights alone.

Okay, so I didn't put it nicely. It's Friday and I'm rotating the stock in
the liquor cabinet. Sue me.
