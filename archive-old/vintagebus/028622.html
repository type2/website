Subject: need westy interior light part
References: &lt;200006211424.HAA20155_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi all - The other day my overly excited dog Simon spun around
repeatedly in anticipation of our swimming as I pulled up to a lake.
Well, I heard an ugly snap and found that his rear had broken the light
switch to one of the interior, side lights.

Anyone have a spare switch available? The Westy is a 67 and the interior

lights are the striaght sided shades with a white pushbutton switch. The

broken part is the white pushbutton and cuff.

Thanks - Tim
