just FYI, my rack which I beleive is an original, is steel. I beleive it was
galvanized originally-when I bought the bus the rack was covered in rust....i
had it blasted and metalized ( a type of galvanizing, not hot dipped but
sprayed on) no rust since then(over two years ago) the guy told me it shoudl
last about 40 years....

When I bought the rack, it was shipped in pieces.  The
aluminum rails were toast.  I couldn't find replacements,
but I did find steel tubes of the right diameter.  Within
a short while, they rusted, and they look like crap.  I'm
sure I'm having galvanic corrosion issues as well, of
which I'm not yet aware.

&gt; 
&gt; why no steel?
