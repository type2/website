&gt;He knew I had run 6 volt accessories on a 12 volt beetle by installing two
&gt;6volt batteries in series and running the 12 volt from the second battery
&gt;and the 6 volt stuff from the first battery.  My friend's problem is
&gt;reversed, he wants to run newer 12volt stuff on a 6 volt rig.  What we
&gt;were contemplating is two six volt batteries, again in series, but what
&gt;we haven't mapped out is the process of putting a 12volt generator on the
&gt;motor, and at what point would you wire the original 6 volt equipment?

The stock (first) 6 volt battery has its negative terminal connected to
the body sheet metal.  6 volt equipment in the car connects to the
positive terminal of this (first) battery.  The positive terminal of
this (first) battery connects to the negative terminal of the new
(second) 6 volt battery.  12 volt equipment in the car (including the
generator) connects to the positive terminal of the new (second) 6
volt battery.

&gt;Could you run the coil/ignition/starter etc wired from the 1st battery?

Yes.

&gt;Are there any big pitfalls I'm ignoring?

The stock (first) battery that runs all your 6 V stuff may not get
charged very well.  A 12 V generator is trying to charge two 6 V
batteries in series.  The new (second) battery, if it is only running
a few 12 V accessories, won't discharge as much as the stock (first)
battery running most of the car.  The new (second) battery, if it
has a higher state of charge, will limit the current that can flow
to the stock (first) battery, so the stock (first) battery won't
charge all the way up.

I have done the same thing on ex-military trucks, except they used
24 V (two 12 V batteries) and I was trying to hook up 12 V equipment.
It worked, but I had to use the battery charger relatively frequently
to get both batteries to the same state of charge.
