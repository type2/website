 Hummmm? You guys never seem to amaze me. You send me hate mail when I tell
 someone how to lower there bus the &quot;correct&quot; way, but you give tips and hints
 on how to lobotomize his bus. THIS is what ruins buses, what happens when he
 thinks that he's in too deep, or just gives up. One more for the yard! I
agree
 with Shawn and Mike. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
It is called being subtle, in other words how many double door panels, deluxe
sunroof s are out there to install a sunroof on.  As to your &quot;correct way of
lowering&quot; we just point out the factual tech reasons why it is nowhere as good
as the stock 1955-67 suspension for bus and thusly more dangerous.  By the way
did you know that lowered type 3s have a problem with the drums cracking from
the new thrust angle that lowering does to them?  Take a look at a type3 drum
and then a 1955-67 bus drum and see which one is thicker and more robust
between the axle and where the shoes ride.    Eric &amp; Barb
