&lt;&lt; have you guys ever read that part in the bently manual about removing the
 side view mirror arm from the door hinge?  It says to work it to and fro,
 well mine snapped like the neck of a spring chicken! ill be outside drilling
 if anybody needs me
 jb/alabama
  &gt;&gt;

keep in mind that when that book was written these were fairly new cars.

I use lots of penetrating oil, and unscrewing the nut so it his flush with 
the bottom of the stem I tap up.   use vise grip to wiggle it.  yes can be a 
PITA.  be careful when drilling not to waller out the hinges so as to not get 
sloppy door syndrome.
