 Baaaa Haaaa  LOL!  That is sooo ironic.  VH1 just ran a rock 'n roll
 movie special last night and in it was a 2 minute section on Arlo and
 his band of merry dumpers and draft avoiders.  The red micro was all
 over it.  I've never seen the movie (Alice's restaurant massacree), but
 you can bet I'm going to go and find it. The micro bus was chartreuse in
 the film though.  Its not just for Thanksgiving ya know.
 
 Somewhere on the net I've seen pictures of Arlo (present day) standing
 next to the bus.  Good to see it still lives...same color too.
 
 Now where did I leave that draft card anyway?

If I remember right it was a beige grey/sealingwaxred standard micro 1964 
model year with the basalt interior.
