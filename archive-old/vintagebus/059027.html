Subject: RE: [VB] Parts needed

As a follow up to my request for help sourcing some parts I have some
updates.  For some reason I thought that the pre-heater tube was supposed to
be on the right side when it should be on the left.  Okay so I have the
correct rear tin BUT I need to metal tube that bolts to the lower exhaust
stud on the left side.  I have a right side metal tube to trade but have no
idea what vehicle it came from except to guess that it is from a '67 Beetle.
Anyway I also am looking for the semi-circle pulley tin without the hole for
the drip tube.  I would also like to find that stupid clamp that holds the
cardboard pre-heater tube away from the pulley as can be seen in the engine
compartment picture of David's Tipper.  That is mostly a luxury item however
but the other two items are mucho important so I'm hoping that someone will
have them for sale or trade:)

Regards,

Thomas
