Subject: Re: [VB] the Term &quot;Split Window&quot;

&gt; &gt; First, lemme zipper up my asbestos flame suit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; window bus then I call it &quot;my early bus&quot;  or &quot;my
&gt; 60.&quot;  Am I alone in this?  Do
&gt; &gt; I need to just get a grip?

Is this REALLY a sensible question???
I think not!
Definitely get a grip.
If I talk about my 67 panel, I use the term split
window if the person I'm speaking to doesn't
understand which model this is.
When I talk about my '77 Microbus I don't always refer
to it as a bay.....VW didn't build &quot;splits&quot; in the
70s.
If I talk to anyone outside the bus scene here in Oz I
speak about Kombis, which they presume means
everything from campers to deluxes to microbuses to
panels to DCs &amp; SCs, &amp; then go into specifics from
there.
If we want to get picky, doesn't &quot;vintage&quot; refer to
cars over 50 years old?
Even if it is 40 yrs old that'd make alot of the
&quot;buses&quot; we talk about &quot;veteran&quot;.
Should we have a &quot;veteranbus&quot; list???
Of course not.
I think I've made my point.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
