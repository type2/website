No, Oregon is now part of Columbiana, a sovereign nation of the PNW.  Oregon 
was been annexed, and all this about middle eastern terrorists was merely a

(unfortunately, we brought the American zoning regulations and neighbors and 
their feuds with us when we seceded.)

 If I'm not mistaken, I think Ronnie lives in Oregon.  Last I heard they
 were still part of the Union, but they might have been kicked out for
 not paying sales tax I'm really not sure ;-) &gt;&gt;
