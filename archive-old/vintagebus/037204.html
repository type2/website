&lt;&lt; For the first 4 days that i got it running I had  my headlights working but
tonight when showing my lights to a friend suddenly my driver side headlight
began  to smoke alot.Is this due to the addition of a 12 volt system.
 
 I'm also can't get my turn signals, horn,and brake light to work. The  PO
drove it after converting to 12volt.But it Still has all  6 volt signal
relays, etc. I looked at many of the articles on converting 6 volt to 12 volt
systems, but they are vague in
 reference to making the lights work with a voltage change since the PO was
unaviable to tell me what he has done. please help me if you can. I know this
is a stupid question and I may have missed some helpful articles from one of
the web sites or from the idiot book.Should I change all of the  6 volt stuff
out or can I
 use a voltage drop to make them work.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
First clean all your connections up, even just taking the slip on connectors
on and off will help there.  Then replace all the relays and light bulbs to 12
volt.  The horn, fuel gauge will work fine on 12 volts as long as you do not
sit on the horn for long periods.  For the wiper motor remove clean and
regrease it's gear box with lithuim grease about 1/3 full and install a volt a
drop in front of it.  You should check with House of Ghia for thier signal box
adapter which gets rid of the $90.00+ signal relay your year and 1967 has and
allows you to use two standard three prong relays that are availble worldwide
in any parts shops.  Most of all just check everything again to make sure that
things are hooked up right.     Eric &amp; Barb
