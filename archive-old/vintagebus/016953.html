This, IMHO, is the best solution.  If you're installing a new trans
in a 60-66 bus, get one of the &quot;repro&quot; (I think it's brazlian) nose
cones that has the switch boss in it.  It also has an improved seal
for the hockey stick.  I was going to put one in the '60, but they
were out of stock when I picked up my tranny, and I wasn't patient
enough to wait for one.
