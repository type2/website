Subject: cooler exploded, is my oil to thick ?
To: VINTAGEBUS_at_type2_dot_com

hey all , 
Trying to fix my cooler explosion problem , I have had some of the following 
input 
is it possible that my oil is to thick for this cold weather
the first time that it exploded it was 20w50 and the second time i used 10w30
IS THIS WHY IT HAS BLOWN UP TWO OIL COOLERS , IT HAPPENED ON START UP BOTH 
TIMES WHEN THE ENGINE WAS 40 DEGREES .engine is 1000 miles on a fresh 
rebuild.   Help please send your suggestions
   &lt;John,     
 &lt;The main reasons for oil coolers, filters, galleys etc...  exploding is too 
much oil &lt;pressure.  This may be caused by too thick of an oil being used in 
the winter time.  &gt;Nothing thicker than a 20W should be used this time of 
year!  Others  may be your &lt;oil relief valve is sticking, too big of an oil 
pump or not enough bearing clearance (between main bearings and crankshaft)  
I would suggest repacing your cooler with a brand new one and running thinner 
oil such as straight 20w or 5w-30.  Do not use 10w-30, 30w or 40w  this time 
of year especially in a new engine.  Let me know what happens!

                               Justin
