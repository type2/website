hey, just a little story...
i got a new bus last spring cuz i knew the one i had was unsalvagable. but 
the bad bus already had been registered as a historical vehicle through the 
DMV in Columbus. (an 8 week proce$s) so i just flopped the vin plates on the 
air vents and my new bus is now my old bus, as far as the state of Ohio is 
concerned. i didnt want to have to go through changing title and paying more 
taxes, so technically i have an extra clear title that i just need to 
register. i probably wouldn't have done it this way but the istorical 
registration in Ohio is a ONE TIME fee of $14.75, no emissions tests either! 
too easy. save the flames, i dont care.
