&lt;&lt; I've torn most of it apart, and I'm at the stage where I have to  remove
the plug on the back of the box.
 Bentley says to wield a nut on the plug, but I don't have any wielding gear.
 Is there any other way to do this?  Would propane be enough  heat to braze
the nut on sufficiently (doubt it)?

Hi Markus,
Well it is doubtfull if you could get brazing done with just propane, but you
could lead solder a nut onto it.  Or just drill a small hole in the center of
the plug and use a body dent puller to yank it out.  Either way make sure to
really clean the dirt and built up rust around the plug with a sharp knife or
exacto blade so the plug has a smooth exit to prevent sticking.   Eric&amp;Barb
