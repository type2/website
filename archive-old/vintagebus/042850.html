Hey folks!
Just wanted to let everyone know that I just got an original German bud
vase from my great aunt who bought a brand new '56 bug in Germany when she
lived there.  The bug is long gone, but she kept the vase.  Sorry if this
isn't all that bus related, but I'm sure that some buses where outfitted
with bud vases too!  Anyone know about how much the vase is worth?  Also,
I got an old Dinky toy of a bug from about the same era.
