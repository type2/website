At least we can agree on that!!!

Too bad he didn't feel this way when it was HIM looking for parts to buy. And his
5 minute away contact................it's not my job to track him down, that's
Dan's job. I'll leave messages when I call but I won't beg. I'm starting to think
it wasn't worth his time to help out such an ungracious soul..................
