&gt; I can't speak for any buses in Brazil, but the 1975 run of 
&gt; Brazilian splits
&gt; assembled in South Africa had push-button rear aprons, no 
&gt; crank-start. And
&gt; as for the German buses assembled here from 1955 to 1967, I 
&gt; suspect they
&gt; followed the same or slightly later changeover. My original 
&gt; 57 kombi has
&gt; the crank start, but all the 60s buses I've seen are without.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the crank start is &quot;correct&quot; for all splitty production as it
&gt; could be retro-fitted as a dealer option in the 1960s 
&gt; according to my VW
&gt; tech literature.


I have only seen one South African bus with a crank apron (fig's '57). I
made a point of searching for one for my '60 d cab every time I came across
a bus in the weeds and I have yet to come across one.
