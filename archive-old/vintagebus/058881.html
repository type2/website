Subject: RE: [VB] Flip seat Westy/ M code help

  Another thing. I looked at Everetts site for the colors and at the pics of
the bus again and it appears that the color code SK 1023 is white upper with
a sky blue? lower. This was determined by the inside of the engine lid and
doors. Has anyone ever seen this combination before and are Sikkens pait
colors all special order? Never have run into this before to ask the
question.

  I am in the process of purchasing this bus. There is no SO 34 on the
m-code plate. Where would this number be on a 1963 flip seat Westy?

here is a photo of the M code plate, it's screwed to the passenger seat
