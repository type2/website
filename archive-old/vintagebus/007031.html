Subject: ADMIN NOTE:  Type2 List archives are back online and up to date..

The archives were down the last 48 hours... had some updates to do.  If you
encounter any problems, please email me and do NOT post to the list.

Archives have been updated and indexing is running right now.  Most messages
are on-line already, but it will take a few hours to get 100%.  I also
downloaded all the current messages so archives are now current.

I am also working on a updated interface for the archive search pages...
expect that in the next 10 days.
