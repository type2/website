&gt;I have an auxiliary single-relay batt. kit installed in my '61 Westy.  I'm
&gt;having a problem blowing fuses when the key is turned on.

I'm not sure where the fuse is in this circuit, but one possibility may
be that one of your batteries is fairly low.  When the two batteries are
connected together, the good one tries to charge the low one, and if the
low one is low enough, the high charging current might blow a fuse.  (The
wiring is supposed to limit the current flow between the two batteries,
but if one is really discharged for some reason, the wire might not
provide enough current limiting.)

After the Bus has been sitting for a while, check the voltage right at the
terminals of both the aux battery and the regular battery.  You want to
see 12.6 volts or so.  If one battery is much lower than this, charge it
up (by running the engine above idle, or with a battery charger) and try
the connection again.

If you can point me to an online copy of the schematic/wiring diagram, I
might be able to give a more detailed answer.
