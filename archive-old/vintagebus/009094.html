Could be. I don't think they pay all this money just to export and daily
drive these over in Japan. I don't think they want to put them in museums as
well. Something is up.
We better hold ours as long as we can.

&gt; I think I posted this once before, back in the early eightys the Japans
were
&gt; coming over and buying up all the 356 Porsches they could, that drove the
&gt; prices up to unheard of levels, when the market peaked they brought the
cars
&gt; back and resold them for major profits, again flooding the market, then
the
&gt; crash, all the U.S. car investors took it in the shorts while the Japans
&gt; were laughing all the way to the bank, looking for the next vehical to
&gt; artificially inflat, could this be the VW transporter???
