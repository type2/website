The antennas on Safari equipped busses where mounted in the center, or on the side with a couple of bends. Some barndoors had 'em mounted over the emblem. Check out the pics in books or the websites.  I did neither because it requires holes. Get a piece of aluminum and a fender mount antenna. Shape it to mount under the mirror bolt in the front upper door hinge. Won't slap the front of your bus, gets better reception away from the body and no holes in the bus. 

The one-eyed duck mounts at the base of the windshield split. Measure twice, center punch and drill once. 

Jerome... Anybody want to play a friendly game of poker?
