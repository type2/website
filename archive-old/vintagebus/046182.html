&lt;&lt; Can ya'll help me please? I have looked at several of the websites that
 decode the M-codes. I was able to get answers to several of my numbers
 for my 65 Westy. Some are still a puzzle. If anyone can help me out I
 would be most grateful.
 
 23 4 (Date of Manufacture) - yes- 23rd  April is the birthday
 425(Seat belts or US Specs)  - seat belts is 025, i call this a us spec 
package code
 A42               - S0-42 westy with group A (some westy person knows)
 002                  - mystery, please tell  when you find out
080 -                  walk through
 108(Westy SO-42)
 UL (POE Calif.)  
 2312(Kombi)  
523907(Pastel White Ex) 
 5141996(ChassisNo) ------------actually, this is NOT the chassis number, the 
first digit (5) is the modelyear, there the 6 digit serial number your 
chassis number is this number with the first two digit of the model number 
before it, meaning your chassis # is 235141996
 ======================================================
 I am also posting an update on the restoration of the Batmobile, my '65
 Westy. I hope you enjoy it.
