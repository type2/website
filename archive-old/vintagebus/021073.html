Subject: So. Cal insurance $10.80/month

Yep. My jaw almost dropped when I found out that
insuring DARTHVW as a classic car in Los Angeles would
only set me back $10.80 per month.

Company: State Farm. We have both other vehicles
insured under them, so there may be a multi-discount,
but the classic policy is new from them. 

Mileage restrictions?

Don't think so, but I haven't received the full policy
in the mail yet.

$6,000 coverage (unrestored 21 window)


Check it out if you're interested.

67 21 window, all black with a red beltline (for now).
