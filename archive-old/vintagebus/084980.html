Subject: Re: [VB] Where are the Mcodes on 64 FlipSeat!

Hi Steve,
Good guess, but all the Flip-seat Westies we have seen or know  about were 
built on a swivel seat bus body.  So to begin with, no  rear sheet metal to 
screw the Mcode to.  
  Would be interesting to hear from OG swivel seat owners if the  Mcode 
plates were installed in the same place...
