All this talk on driving buses, how many of you have ever looked to see how
many 60's American iron you see on the road on a daily basis? Here in Lake
Havasu, population 40,000 closest city 45 miles away either direction, you
will see numerous 60's VW's driven on a daily basis, bugs, buses and bays. I
have had many out of town visiters comment on the quanity of VW's that they
see and are amazed. The heat hasn't really stopped people from driving them
here, example's original owner 64 rag, 65 sedan, 68 bug driven daily, at
least 5 splits driven daily includung Delaneys 51 Samba and that's not
counting all the kids Cal Lookers, Manx copies and Baja Bugs, VW's are made
to be driven and Havasu probally has one of the highest VW drivers to
population in the country and the heat hasn't really stopped anybody from
driving their VW's, remember it's a dry heat, Ha Ha 115 at 10 am.
