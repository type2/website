That works OK, and I used pliers for years myself, but...

Using pliers makes it harder to end up with the proper gap between the
throttle arm and the stop because you're more able to tension the throttle
wire.

The method I outlined is virtually &quot;fail safe&quot;, precisely because you
_can't_ put much tension on the throttle wire using just your fingers.

Give it a try next time.....

&gt;&gt;  I just grab ahold of the end of the cable with a pair of needle nose
pliers
and tighten down the holding screw. This also gives you something to use to
hold everything while you tighten down the screw.  &lt;&lt;
