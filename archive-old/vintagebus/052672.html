Subject: Re: [T2] yet more tires



&gt; I went to Goodyear to ask about 603vs. 89.00 and a week to deliver + 
sales
&gt; tax. Naaa.

I find the price on these varies widely.  I've bought them as cheaply 
as $55 each out the door.

Try a Firestone outlet.  Since they are owned by Bridgestone they are 
more likely to be in stock there.  Bridgestone 603Vs were OEM tires on 
1-ton Toyota pickups and Toyota dual-wheel flatbeds, so they are still 
readily available.  My local Firestone store says that they keep 10 in 
their inventory.  Your local Toyota dealer might be able to tell you 
where their customers get their tires.

&gt; The same tires were 66 ea +42 to ship from tire rack. 72.00 less and
&gt; approx the same delivery time.
&gt; I opted for the yoko 356s anyway which are 8$ cheaper each.
&gt; I told the guy that it was pretty weak that the dealer cant even get
&gt; competitive to the mail order price. He just shrugged. His loss.
&gt; Im going to the haitian place to get them mounted noone can balance 
them
&gt; anyway just to support a real small buisness.

Get a spare drum and take it with you.  The wheel can be mounted on the 
drum then the drum mounted on the machine.
