Any one going through Reno on the way to the Classic
this weekend, and would like to give a ride to and fro
(will share expenses)to a friend of mine who was going
with me. I have to bail out this weekend.....
If anyone can help out a Split Bus fanatic and
co-founder of Northern Nevada Volkswagen Assoc. please
call him at 775  359-1135

Thanks

Reno
