that the tube which carries the accelerator cable through the fan shroud had 
become displaced and was pressed up agains the carbuerator linkage. I moved 
the tube back to its correct place, but now I'm experiencing the problem 
above. &gt;&gt;

Hi John,
To prevent the tube from shifting back and locking up the carb linkage you 
need to either use the pre-1968 VW upright return spring on the cable and 
tube or install a small hose clamp on the forward of fan shroud on this tube 
to keep it in place.  When the engine is out next time install a fender 
washer and the small hose clamp on the tube to really do the job right.  
Either way once you have the tube secure tune your engine and especially the 
carb and see if that does the trick.   Eric&amp;Barb
