Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shock Replacement HELP

use penetrating oil.   also get a grinder or file and make flat sides onto 
the metal bushing so you can vise grip it off.  Careful not to grind into the 
stud.   Wear eye and ear protection.

&lt;&lt; In the process of changing out my front shocks and ran into a
 problem. The metal spacer that fits inside the rubber bushing is stuck
 on the stud attached to the front beam. Does anyone know an easy way to
 pop it off. Any help would be greatly appreciated...
