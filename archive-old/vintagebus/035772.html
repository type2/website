&lt;&lt; All--
 Recently I ordered a headliner for my 1967 single cab from Calif. Imports 
 (their #T20-2107-44) for 1965-74 single cabs.  My understanding is that my 
 headliner should be cardboard (fiberboard?) like the kick panels.  What came 
 is a vinyl, perforated headliner that looks like half a beetle's headliner.  
 And it's one rectangular piece, with no provision for the roof vent.
 
 What gives?  Is this completely wrong?  Does it have to be cut?  Does it 
 cover the cardboard headliner?  What?  I do have the parts book, and it 
shows 
 two separate pieces for the headliner.--David

hm- The splitty trucks came with hardboard panels, and yes the air vent would 
made it wierd to put a headliner vinyl type in one.  Not sure what the bay 
window trucks came with, maybe they did get vinyl.  I would return it, and 
get or make hardboard roof liner for your truck.
