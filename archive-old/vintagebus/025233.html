Oh Tay Volks,

At the present I am &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; for Charter communications.  However
I've been a seafood restaurant cook, Furniture salesman, convenience
store cashier, Asst. Mgr. for a local FLAPS and even a factory worker _at_
Graco &amp; John Deer Consumer products.  I Love the Cable Guy thing because
it allows me to leave &quot;Janis&quot; on blocks so she can get the care she
deserves and I'm able to locate all kinds of Busses on my travels!
That's a lot of jobs but it does cover 16+yrs. with the same babe
&quot;Janis&quot;  Good to make some things last!

The Busma is with us!
