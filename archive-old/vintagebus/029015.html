Subject: RE] Options for retaining hubcap clips

Rex,
I did this on Frodo a couple of weeks ago. I used a countersunk screww
and 2 nut to lock the screw into place. I removed the old rivet by
making an x on the head of the rivet with a small chisel. I was then
ablle to drill them out. I figured that with 2 nuts I would be able to
hold one with a wrench while unscrewing the other. The countersunk
screws also fit tight in the old rivet holes
