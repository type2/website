&gt;&gt;$50 seems like a lot for such a product.
&gt;
&gt;You guys said $50.00 ............... I said get your magnets out of an
&gt;old hard drive. [...] That is free.

Right.  I mentioned getting magnets from a hard drive too.  The original
product that Ronnie posted about had a $50 retail price tag.  What I
was trying to say is that $50 seems like a lot of money for what is
probably the same kind of magnets that come out of a hard drive.  In
other words I was agreeing with you.  I think the idea of using a
magnet to pick up ferrous stuff in your oil might work, but I,
personally, wouldn't spend $50 to find out.
