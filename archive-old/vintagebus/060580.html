Subject: Re: [VB] Re: cargo door woes on 65' bus/new bus

Ya, you just gotta get them aligned properly.  It's a funny angle, they don't 
go all the way over to the side.    I try to avoid removing the rods unless 
absolutely neccessary.  Tie the upper bars in place with wire if you have to 
replace the mechanism.

Funny thing is I just acquired a new bus- 65 american camper, not sure what 
brand.  For some unknown reason the check rods and mechanism of the rear 
cargo door are gone.  And the mechanism for the front cargo door does not 
retract the lower rod.  So the thing is, I have some check rods, but I'll 
have to figure out which is which.  joy!
