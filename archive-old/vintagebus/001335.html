Try these guys. They run a VW only wrecking yard - tons of stuff from all
years. I'd call first - I think they moved from Vista to Escondido.

Interstate VW
1936 South Santa Fe Avenue, Vista, CA 92083

I don't know what your looking for exactly, but I got a rebuilt long block
from VW Paradise in San Marcos for around $400 (+ my core).
