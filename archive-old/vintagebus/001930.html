&gt;Where exactly is the ground wire that attaches to or
&gt;near the gas tank. I believe this is what is causing
&gt;my guage not to work.

Should screw into the stiffener on the engine compartment ceiling. Just in
front of the fan shroud and look up.

Additionally my high beams don't
&gt;want to switch off.  I looked for a dimmer switch on
&gt;the floor, after reading my (63-67 Bentley, $70 from
&gt;JC whitney after delivery!!!) I guess I don't have
&gt;one.

Lift up on the turn signal switch with the lights on, just like a new car.

&gt;Also, can I remove the back/closer to front engine tin
&gt;w/out dropping the engine.  Ie: remove gas line and
&gt;starter bolt plus 2 egine tine screws.

Remove the gas line, accelerator cable, and the cheesehead screws located on
each side and you should be able to pry it out of there. It may be bolted to
the front join between the upper and lower cylinder tin as well as the one
screw on each end. Will be more difficult if converted to doghouse. You
should not need to remove a starter bolt. It would be easier to pull the
motor out and drop it down a bit to do it, IMHO.
