&gt; Well, hopefully your soon-to-be widow has at least taken out a large life
&gt; insurance policy on you.  

Nope, took care of that detail myself.

&gt; When you crash, try to go in front end first,
&gt; so all the DC-specific rear end sheet metal can be used on the DC of
&gt; someone who isn't running quarter-century-old tires.

In the event of a catastrophic mishap I've instructed the wife to part
out the remains of the DC to the mailing list.  We're going to use one
of the headlight buckets for my cremation urn, though.  ;-)

&gt; Besides the tread wear, the rubber in tires degrades with time, from
&gt; exposure to the sun, ozone, chemicals, etc.  Your tires can have plenty
&gt; of tread and still be ready to pop at any moment.

You are absolutely correct, of course.

&gt; Please get some newer tires for your double cab.

A complete set of 5 new light truck tires has been on my to-do list
since before I've had two kids in college (about 4 years, in fact).
