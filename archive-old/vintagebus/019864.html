&gt;As long as the #1 mark on the rim of the distributor is in line with the #1 
&gt;spark plug at the same time.  Otherwise you might be using the #3 section of 
&gt;the distributor for #1 cylinder which will knock your timing off several 
&gt;degrees and probably cause heat damage to your engine.   Eric&amp;Barb

Hmm - good point, but isn't the #3 effect accomplished by the lobe on the shaft, about which there is nothing I can do?  That is, the alignment of the driving dog, offset 
lobe, and rotor are fixed - unrelated to alignment of the distributor body, cap, and wires.  Dunno if I'm making that clear enough.
