Wolfgang International in Redding CA just sold me new shims, rubber
seals and bushings about two weeks ago. They also sold me rebuilt
kingpinlinkpinsteeringknuckle assemblies, which did a world of good
for the handling of my rattlewagen. That was a big boost to my
confidence in this old ride, I'm glad I did it.

I'm on a search for some parts for my neighbor so that he can finish
putting
together his '61 23 window.

Looking for

1. shims - used in the steering king/link to adjust the camber.
Quantity:
enough to do one side
2. rubber seals/bushings to cover the same shims.
3. German bus nose cone

It would be ideal if the rubber seals were new, the other parts can be
new
or used as long as in good condition.

Thanks,

Scott
