....ditto for that,    and don't you need a special kind of voltage drop that 
is more specific for the radio, which is more delicate that say a wiper motor.

 Hi Albert,
 You need to reduce each item on it's own resistor to get stable proper 
 voltage.  You also need to reduce the voltage to the wiper motor!   Eric&amp;Barb
