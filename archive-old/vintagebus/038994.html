Hey All,

This is my first post here so I will tell you a little about me and my bus.
I am 24 years old and I live in Clayton, CA. A small suburb in the Bay-Area.
I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in
Dec. to be exact. I work with a small start-up internet realty application
service provider (we develop software) and am very happy. 

Now, my bus. It is 38 years old, I have owned it for four years, I bought it
way back in Oct. of 96. I knew then that it would be a long project, which
has yet to come to fruition. It is a 63 microbus, 15 window deluxe. It is
totally stripped and has been shot and sanded three times. All body work is
complete and the restoration has finally begun. I am sure I will gain much
advice and knowledge from this list, I love open forums like this.

Anyway, thanks in advance, as I learn I will pass it on-

Regards,

Seth Haynes
