Subject: Re: [VB] Hole above engine bay.

Let me explain a little further.  I don't believe there is anything special
about the bus.  My '65 standard has a round hole cut in the rear most area
above the engine.  It then had a layer of heavy fiber board screwed in
(useing the interior panel screws) with the same diameter hole cut in the
fiber board.  Then there is a fiber board insert that fits into the hole to
cover it up.  This insert is double layered, with one layer fitting in the
hole and the other larger keeping it from falling through.  Does that help?
It sure look stock to me.

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt; &gt; One of the PO's cut a really cool huge square hole above the engine, I
&gt; &gt; guess so they could get at the engine from above.  I have found the
&gt; &gt; panels to replace this hole, but on my '65 there is a 11&quot; or 12&quot; inch
&gt; &gt; round hole above the engine.  Should this hole also be in an early '59
&gt; &gt; or should the panel be solid.
