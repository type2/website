&gt; Damn and you guys think Im a price gouger!?
&gt; Ive wanted a step like this, have been offered them in the last few months
&gt; for around 150$.

Before everybody lynches this guy.It might be the style step that
moves in  when you close the cargo doors and out when you open them.
Ambulance only step!!!
Much much more elaborate than a normal step.
not sure if it's worth $800 but worth quite a bit!!
