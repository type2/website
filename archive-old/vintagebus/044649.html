Hi Boyd,
You do not mention if your engine is a SP or DP.  Both are stock!  From what 
you describe it sounds like you might have a vaccume leak on one side of the 
intake manifold.  Which would cause the air/fuel mixture going to that side 
of the engine to lean out.  This in turn means that head and those cylinders 
will run hotter than the other side and the valves especially the exhaust 
valves will stretch!
  This is one of the nasty problems with the DP especially because the DP 
only rubber seal gets old and cracks, and those silly thin metal intake 
manifold to head seals they have never seem to work well.  So DP owners have 
to keep an eye for cracks forming in these rubber seals (When replacing these 
seals make sure the metal surfaces this seal is supposed to form against is 
clean of corrosion ans smooth!) and replace them before they become a 
problem, and are better off replacing those thin manifold to head seals with 
hand cut gaskets made out of high temp gasket material.
  Find your problem and check you valve adjustments way more often till you 
get to needing to adjust only a couple of the eight valves a .001&quot; or so 
every 3,000 miles.
