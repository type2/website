I was taught that the thicker cylinder wall like stock was better for
dissapating heat.  87mm liners tend to make a engine run a little
hotter.  They are not considered too thin among engine builders when you
compare them to the slip in 88mm cylinders.  I have always thought, why
spend the money on 87mm when you only gain a couple of horses.  You
might as well stick with stock and have a cooler running engine.  90.5mm
pistons and cylinders are a great way to get added horse power and yet
still retain the reliability like a stock engine.  We have a 1776cc
engine built only with oversize pistons and cylinders and everything
else stock and it has performed flawless for the last few years.  Either
way I am sure most people would be very happy to have either engine
combo.
