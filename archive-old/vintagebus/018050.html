Learn from my mistake:

I was replacing my steering wheel. I went to put the
woodruf key (that litle half-moon piece which fits
into the steering column and makes the notch which
sticks into the slot in your steering wheel) into it's
divot in the steering column, and WHOOPS! it
disappeared. Followed by the slow grrrrrrrr sound of a
small half-moon metal piece sliding down to the bottom
of the steering column. 
Yep.
I had put it onto the steering column at too steep an
angle and it slipped through the slot in the divot and
slipped down the steering column.

Watch out for this. You have to put it onto the column
flat, just about the angle it sits at to mount the
wheel.

So, how did I get it back?

I made a trip to the local hardware store and paid
$9.79 for one of those pocket pen magnets. I made an
extension for it by making a long tube out of 3&quot;
masking tape, and sending it down the column. I got it
back, along with about 5 magnet loads worth of
rust/metal shavings. But that was a $10, 45-minute
setback.

One question: could I have undone the four bolts on
the square bottom plate on the steering box (the plate
the horn wire comes out of) and retrieved it there? I
wasn't sure what else was under that plate.
