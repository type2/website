hey all,
if anybody wants or needs them, i had a friend that works at PPG's Refinish 
here in Cleveland dig up some paint chips and match paint for these colors i 
am going to paint the westy this summer. they look pretty &quot;dead on balls&quot; to 
quote My Cousin Vinny. although they are only on a 5x7 panel right now ;) 
they are for DBC, whatever that means. p-mail for more info.
later,
Bob Margiotti
