Bendix manufactured Sapphire for VWoA starting in '60 with the Sapphire I
AM radio and it featured the large channel selector.
In '62 came the Sapphire II AM/FM
'63 brought about a new appearance 3/8&quot;x5/8&quot; buttons
'64 Motorola and Bendix both became manufacturers for the &quot;I&quot; series and
the differences for this were that the PCB and tuner insides were
different.
Bendix alone made the &quot;II&quot; for '64 and '65
'66 Sapphire III AM was made again by both companies and the &quot;IV&quot; AM/FM
was a Bendix only in '66.
Sapphire V was a 12V AM made by both for '67, but the Sapphire VI, also
12V and AM/FM was a Bendix only model.
By '68 AM only radios made by both companies and Motorola was the only
manufacturer from '70 and later.
For those of you who are not familiar with an individual by the name of
&quot;Brad Clausen&quot; and wish to have any VW radio restored/repaired....this is
the guy to send it to.
He lives in Wisconsin and is an excellent technician who does not charge
overly inflated prices for his work.  He is very fair.
I have sent radios to him...one of which would never have been repaired by
anyone, except that Brad went way above and beyond to fix it.  That's
another story for another time maybe.
Point?  If you need a repair...he's an excellent candidate.
The previous info. comes from him by the way.

&gt; I have been surfing around today, as the boss man is out sick, and have
&gt; noticed a half dozen or so Sapphire 1 radios out there.  While some of
&gt; them look similar a couple don't.  Is there a reference anywhere that
&gt; would tell me what I should have both in my 65 and in my 59.
