&gt;&gt; Is that possible?  I didn't look at it to see if the carbs were
&gt;&quot;flipable&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Your not yanking my chain to see if I would fall for the old &quot;Yea 
dude you
&gt;&gt; just gota flip the carb around&quot; trick are you?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No, I'm not joking Chuck.  If you think about it, flipping the carb 
around
&gt;would make the throttle shaft rotate the other direction.  Then the arm
&gt;would be pushing straight down on either side.  This is how my Weber's 
are.
&gt;I don't know how the Kadrons and their single barrel setups work but I 
can't
&gt;help but think that left carb need to be rotated 180 degrees.  How 
about the
&gt;rest of you - anyone running Berg linkage with dual Kads?

On the kads the float bowl is on the other side, simply rotating that puppy 180 degrees would put that thing right in the way of the linkage. I've looked it over a couple of times now and can't figure it out, but it sure doesn't look right to me either. I think Chuck should just get some berg 58's and throw on that engine ;-)
