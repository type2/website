Subject: Re: [VB] Weird timing light

Taking a wild guess here, but I think you put one end on the end of the
spark plug and the other end of the spring inside the boot of the wire. 
You effectively &quot;tap&quot; into the lead.  That's at least how my Dads old
light (60's  Craftsman I think)used to work.

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; I bought this old &quot;Dixco&quot; timing light at a yard sale for a couple of bucks
&gt; but I dont know how to use it. Apparently it is not an inductive light. On the
&gt; end of the wire where an inductive pick up would be, there is this metal
&gt; spring-like thing attached. Does anyone know how to use this kind of timing
&gt; light?&gt;
