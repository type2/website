Gary Said:
&gt;&gt;First off the Friday topic: I like to go to Berkeley and cruise the Type 2
down Telegraph Ave and have all the hippie chicks flash the peace sign at
me.
Try driving your bus anywhere near Berkeley campus when there's a Cal
football game.  Last year, I drove downtown just after a game against a
Midwest team.  I believe it was Michigan but I don't really know.  I stopped
at a traffic light beside a tour bus filled with out of towners and the
reaction was explosive.  The tour bus lurched to one side with people jammed
up against the window staring into my bus; probably looking for the hippie.
By Berkeley standards, I'm a pretty conservative 40+ year old with a dingy
stock bus.  I noticed a college &quot;babe&quot; in the tour bus giving the thumbs up
as she mouthed the words &quot;Cool Bus&quot;.  I waved back weakly, beeped the horn,
and went home.  Way too much going on downtown to try to go to the hardware
store.  
VW bus starved people from the Midwest partying in California after
defeating the home team. That's the ticket if you crave a little validation.

&gt;&gt;Second Safari windows: Everyone complains that safaris leak. On most buses
I have met the stock stationaries leak too!
Use Henry's Roof Patch!  Eric and Barb recommended this and it really does
work.  I believe the label says it's a plastic caulk but it sure looks and
smells like tar.  It cleans up with mineral spirits and never fully hardens.
