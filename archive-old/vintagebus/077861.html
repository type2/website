Hi Josh,
Be carefull of new heat exchangers!  All the ones we have seen will cause a 
hotter running engine.  The stock ones since early 1964 models not only have 
fins on the outside of the tubes inside the skins of the exchangers, but also 
inside.  These inner ones can just be seen when looking up the rear ends of the 
exchangers with a flashlight.  You should be able to find some good used heat 
exchangers in your area for very little $$$ and at worse ones that will need a 
little welding.
