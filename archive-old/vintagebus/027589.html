Subject: Re: [VB] re: fan shroud

&gt;[...]
&gt;I've been told that they were used on things (type 141)
 He said it was to
&gt;&gt;better direct the airflow into the fan. I think he called it a velocity
&gt;&gt;ring but I could be wrong.
&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what vehicle these are off of either.


Fuel injected Beetles. These are the BEST shrouds to get.
