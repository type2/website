&gt; Why would anyone want eye brows?  Eye Brows are not just for looks, they do
&gt; have a purpose.  I run H-4s head lights, the eye brows keep the my lights

In order to reduce glare in this way, the eyebrows would have to be long
enough to come between the entire headlight and the oncoming traffic!
Figure on about 3-6 feet long!  The 2-inch long eyebrows commonly used
only cut glare for aircraft flying low overhead.

If your european-spec H4 headlights are properly aimed, they will have far
less glare than US-spec sealed beams, since the lens and reflector of the
H4 lights are better made than those of sealed-beam lights.  No need for
add-ons like eyebrows.
