Subject: Re: [VB] whats this?

VOA is the vendor- this kit was designed as a lower cost option and the =
fact that Westy couldn't keep up with oders. Depending on optics/politics =
Ihave read/heard that VOA strongarmed dealers into taking x number of the =
VOA outfitted &quot;campers&quot; if they were to see of the &quot;real&quot; westy ones.

Dunno if &quot;campmobile&quot; is a tradmarked name but note that VOA chose to use =
their cheapest model (the panel van) to outfit the camper with.
