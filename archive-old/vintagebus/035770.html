&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 Scuse my ignorance. Is the shift rod bushing in that little tang that
 hangs down under the cab area and surrounds the shift rod? I know that
 I have this little tang thing hanging down but there is no plastic or
 otherwise bushing thingy in it. Looks like it could use a bushing
 thingy however. A good piece back I suddenly found that my gear shift
 stick could slide out toward the passenger side and make shifting a
 little difficult. Is that a symptom of no bushing?
 
 Thanks,
 Chris

if you have the metal tang at the guide under the front of your bus, I am 
guessing your bus is before 631  071.

if this is worn and no longer keeping the rod from moving sideways, you can 
swap out for a later guide, and put the bushing on your front shift rod, 
which would help shifting.   Having new bushings really makes it nice, IMOPBO.

both the later guide and the front shift bushing are available new.
