Subject: Re: [VB] pressed bumper styles

&gt; So what youre saying Everett, Is dont be surprised when you pull up to pomona in youre barndoor (bus content). You and youre wife jump out, you wearing a poodle skirt doing the humpty dance and her wearing a wife-beater and dickies doing the twist? (Note the dichotomy of my 50s vs. 90s styles, schweet!)
&gt; 
No, I trashed my poodle skirt turning my Bus to reserve a few weeks ago.  I neglected to keep one hand on my skirt ala Miss Manners when working on my Bus.  A sudden gust of wind blew a pleat into the running fan belt.  Whooosh!  Off came my skirt and I was left standing in my slip.  Oh, the humanity!

Bus content:
There's somebody at my new job (Intel in Chandler, AZ) with a yellow/white mid 60s Standard with tinted windows.  Somebody on the list?

- Everett
