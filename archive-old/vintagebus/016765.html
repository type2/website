The fiberglass bondo is for ghetto jobs where you have a large hole to fill.
If I have to buy it, I tell the counter guy &quot;it's for a friend&quot; because 
I'm so embarassed.

BTDTGTTS.

If you have a large enough hole that you need extra strength, perhaps you
should consider more metalwork.

Also, Bondo-brand filler is junk!  Find a bodyshop supply and get the good
stuff.  I use this stuff my by Evercoat, I think it's called &quot;feather fill&quot;
and it's 10 times better.  It has a much finer consistency, spreads
better, and doesn't shrink as bad as the stuff you get at the FLAPS.  
You can also get the hardener in difference colors, which is kinda cool.

For really light work, use a glazing compound - once again, stay away
from Bondo brand.  Their glaze is REALLY CRAPPY! I use something called 
&quot;EuroGlaze&quot; by Evercoat which comes in a squeeze bottle.  It has the 
consistency of chocolate syrup, and you use it with the same hardener that 
you use for the filler.  It's kinda runny, and you use a wide trowel and 
spread it across little dings and scratches.

Follow all of this up with a filling primer.  It's a very thick primer
that's meant to be sanded down.   Think of it as spray-on bondo.  This
stuff will fill #60 sanding scratches!  Break that down with #200, then
#320, then #400, and if you're a glutton for punishment, #600, and
you're ready for paint!
