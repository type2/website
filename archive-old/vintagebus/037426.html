But does a tunnelcase Bus nosecone mount differently than a Bug one?  I'd

hate to pull out the existing Bug rear end to replace it with a Bus

assembly, only to find I can't use the existing Bug nosecone custom mount.

the engine cases all seem to have bug numbers.   If the nose cone is different
you can use the nose cone that fits the bus, but I think they are the same.
Sorry, I have only put a bus tranny in a bus.     Swapping over a nose cone is
easy.  You can looks at the two side by side- even check part numbers, to see
if they are the same.

&gt;Brakes- well yes the brakes from a 66 bus are much bigger than the rear of

&gt;a barndoor.   The barndoor takes the same wheel cylinders on the back as

&gt;on the front of oval window bugs, and the front are barndoor only.

&gt;The brake shoes are the same all the way round on Barndoors.   So you

&gt;will be putting bigger brakes on the front than the back.

&gt;

Is that last sentence reversed?  Shouldn't that be &quot;larger on the back than

the front&quot;?

oops- yes, that's what I meant, I got my words mixed up  :(.   

 As a refresher, the situation was putting big-nut brakes (9.8&quot;)

on the back with front Barndoor (9.0&quot;?) brakes.  Are small-nut brakes (9.0&quot;

also?) suitable for the back instead?  I was unable to find the exact size

of Barndoor front drums in my shop manual...

hm- that would be better.   What are the measurements referring to?  Changing
the reduction gears could be a PITA, though.   Also will change gearing, which
affects how you use the truck.  Somewhere I read someone had put early brake
shoes on a big nut rear axle, though i do not know that this is a good idea.
But actually, if the tranny is out, changing the reduction boxes over isn't
too bad.
