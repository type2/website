Subject: Judges slamming over panel choice?
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My wife and I restored our 67 Westfalia to as close to factory spec as
possible. &lt;albeit the drivetrain is pumped up&gt; We have found that in most
every show that the &quot;judges&quot; are either fellow carshow entrants, the general
attending public, or the promoters. We have not run into a case wherein the
judging was held to the standards of a Concours de Elegance as in the
bigtime Ferrari/Cobra/Mustang/Mercedes/Porsche etc crowds.

Although I love the &quot;dubs&quot; I have a hunch that even the megadollar 23's and
splitovals that are sold to the investors at auction would fall short of
&quot;perfection.&quot; VWs were generally not created in a perfection mode. There is
a chance of over restoring any vehicle. The varnish on the cabinets story
was a good example. Factory paint jobs regularly had orange peeling in them.

So after showing our Camper for two seasons, I would advise tastefully do
what makes sense to you. Do it with craftsmanship &lt;craftspersonship&gt; and
good taste in mind. Be happy and have fun with it. USE the bus! Create good
memories in it and safely enjoy your lives. Hopefully your lives and ours
will pass sometime down the road.

I would vote for the Birch and keep the white masonite boards off to the
side. Todd Swangstu or Micheal Heron are more familiar with most of the
earlier Westfalia camper kits that included mostly white masonite paneling.
If you are worried about &quot;correctness&quot; check with them.
