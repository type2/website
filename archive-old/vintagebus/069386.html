Dave, good idea on the #10 wires from the battery to the lights. When I was
running 6 volt years ago that's what I did. There was too much line loss and
the headlights always ran yellow on the factory wires. I ran the wires through
an old 6 volt Buick horn relay that was switched with my light switch. Worked
great.

The part about driving on the road with deer got me. Do they have to follow
the same rules as bicycles or are they supposed to go against traffic?

What size fuse should these H4 have 25amp?  Looking at the webpage you
recommend helped a great deal.. However onequestion reminds. Does the Dimmer
relay stay in the circuit and that's what activates the relays for low and
high.

I'm running 3 additional 10 g wires from the battery in the back.  They will
be fused back there.  One wire for low beams and one for High beams, the
other will be for a set of Hella Driving lights.  I get off a 2330hrs and
drive 26 miles on a Country road with Deer.
