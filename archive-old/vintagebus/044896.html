&lt;&lt; I don't have howl with my bus roof rack, but some people said they did.  
What 
 kinds of racks are the howlers? so I know to stay away from them
 
 Clara &gt;&gt;
My full length rack has no howl. You can see it by going to the bottom of my 
page.
I've not noticed any great power loss or increased fuel consumption with an 
empty rack. &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/busrock/index.html&quot;&gt;1962 double
