Hi VW Vintage 2 owners,

I am thinking about taking my '58 Westy to  &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://www.vwrestoration_dot_com/menu3.htm&quot;&gt;West Coast Classic VW 
Restoration, We do VW restoration, VW for sale, VW parts, vw upholstery, 
Flat4 parts&lt;/A&gt; in Fullerton, CA for the big job.  Have any of you done 
business with these guys?

Their work looks top notch.  Total restore, what we need, runs about $15 - 
$20K...we were thinking about $15,000 is what it would take, the extra $5,000 
get's a little &quot;tighter&quot; job (decision time).  Your thoughts are welcomed and 
appreciated.

Laura &lt;~Pround Vintage Type II owner
