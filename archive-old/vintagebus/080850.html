&gt; When the engine is cold, it starts quickly and idles fine. It sounds
&gt; great, no tapping sounds, no other unusual stuff. As it begins to warm up,
&gt; a 'tapping' sound begins, primarily from the left side of the engine. Once
&gt; the engine is hot, the tapping sound is quite loud over the regular sound
&gt; of the engine. That is my problem. The engine has great compression
&gt; (130-135 all around, no leakdown), and the timing is fine. Engine idles
&gt; when hot just fine. It has lots of power and doesn't seem to have any
&gt; faults beyond that loud tapping/clicking sound coming from the lower left
&gt; of the engine block. Lower end of engine now has about 75,000 miles on it
&gt; since 1993.

Just some thoughts:

Are the valves adjusted to spec?

Did you notice anything unusual the last few times you adjusted them?  Did 
they go from rarely needing adjustment to one or two being way off?  Etc.

Can you push or pull on the flywheel and feel any endplay?  Even with the 
engine installed, you can feel it if you've got excessive endplay -- ask 
me how I know!

Before you do something like tearing down the engine, you might just want 
to take a look at the valve adjusters and push rods on the noisy side...
