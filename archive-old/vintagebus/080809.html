I doubt this will help you any, because there seem to be so many reasons
for this symptom, but, my engine was doing the same thing (no idle after
warmup) this spring, and after cleaning and checking the like-new
Brasilian carb (3000 miles), I finally threw an old German Solex in there

checked, simply won't idle after it warms up. My engine is a 1776, DP.
