Subject: RE: [VB] Accelorator cable (61DC)

Interesting you should say that.  I couldn't
get the old cable out of my 62 DC because
of that very point in the tube.  Cut the cable and
withdrew from both ends.  Cleaned tube and new cable
wouldn't go in past that very point!

I cut the tube and replaced it from the rear 
centre chassis section back with a 'gentler'
bend....I just kept thinking that breaking a accel cable
on the road could really bite you on the
bum here if not sorted out...

The tube is same size as 8mm (or is it 9mm?)
hydraulic tube and can be bought from any hydraulic
supply shop.

regards

Can anyone tell me the length of the end barrel for a
stock accelorator cable for a 61 double cab?  I have 
a new cable that had a end barrel that was about 1.5&quot;
long.  It would not go thru the tube though.  It got
stuck about 9&quot; from the rear of the bus.  (I tried to
push it thru from both ends and it gets stuck at the
same point.
