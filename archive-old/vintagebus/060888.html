I would adjust the striker plates before I would cut
the seal!

&gt; Hey gang,
&gt; 
&gt; I installed new door rubber in my double cab this
&gt; weekend and later when I went for a spin the
&gt; passenger door swung open on its own.  When I got
&gt; home and inspected the lock mechanism, it seems to
&gt; work fine but the latch part isn't fully locking out
&gt; to catch the door jamb.  The door does seem to sit a
&gt; little less flush than it did before the new rubber
&gt; (it had no rubber though before I installed this
&gt; rubber).  If I trim down the rubber will this help? 
&gt; I was nervous to do this because I don't want to
&gt; loose the seal and let in water/air.  Does a '63
&gt; inside door handle have a &quot;locked&quot; position, or just
&gt; open and close?
