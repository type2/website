hehe,
no seriously....ronnie is right, i'm gettin fewer and fewer messages.  too 
many shows? too many projects?
i for one just have too much work, a 2 year old daughter, and a pregnant 
wife.   drive the bus everyday though.

though the family did head out this weekend..._dot_camped out on the beach in 
cardiff by the sea and cruised up the coast from san diego to oceanside.  saw 
lots of busses, lots of projects and lots of waves and honks.

after eating dinner at denny's the first night get in to fire the 63 up and 
nada......damnit!...damn solenoid...so i crawl under and jump the starter off 
with the trusty ol screwdriver.
did that or roll-started the bus for the rest of the weekend. stopped at an 
picked up a starter on the way home.

get home and think...yeah, i remember jim sayin something bout a hot start 
relay back in the engine comp.   hmm.....open up the decklid and pull the 
little blue 15 amp fuse.....well, sumbitch...burnt.
put in a new one and shes fires right up....but at least i gots me a nice new 
starter in the spare stash.

anyways......
i did see a bee-yoo-tee-full  light green and white splitty heading north on 
the 15 yesterday----right between temecula and murrieta...listee?

i gotta quit smokin that crack rock...makin me ramble way too damn much
