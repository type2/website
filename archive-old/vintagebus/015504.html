The nomenclature would be &quot;made for leaded gas&quot; not &quot;made for regular gas&quot;

The leaded/unleaded-gas thing is part myth, part urban legend.  I haven't
heard of anyone having problems running an older car on unleaded. The
problem was the lead lubed the valved and seats, and running without
it caused premature valve train wear.

In either case, running super isn't going to change things: *all*
gas is unleaded now.

The &quot;knock test&quot; is a good indicator, although with these noisy beasts,
you can't always tell when they're pinging.

&gt; the heads have not been replaced. Therefore they were made for regular gas.
&gt; Does this mean I have to run super? I have gotten from the type2 list over the
&gt; years if it doesn't knock you can use a lower grade.
