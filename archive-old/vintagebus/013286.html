Subject: gas in oil bath on 60 bus??
Message-ID: &lt;19990621133651.15551.qmail_at_www0s_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Hi All-

Background- I have a newly assembled very stock 1600DP w / 1500 era bus oil
bath filter in a 60 kombi which I am ironing out little &quot;issues&quot;

Symptoms- engine appears to be running kinda hot and &quot;gas smell&quot; can be
noticed (the bus not me), this might be due to full tank of gas in bus as well
(last time bus had full tank of gas was prolly at least 6 years ago)

Problem - while inspecting the oil bath filter it appears that there is gas
(!) in oil bath filter (mixed with oil??)

Question- Assuming that the mechanic didn't mix my oil bath with a 50-1 ratio
of oil and gas, can anyone think of how the oil bath might be getting gas in
it and what this might be inidcating??

Thanks!

michael

p.s. would connecting up the heater boxes to the actual &quot;heater tube&quot; that
runs to the front of the bus have any bearing of lowering engine temp..
