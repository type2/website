hey all
I dunno how long I'll be driving Stella in this chilly weather, and her
heat is GREAT in back...but is pathetic up front.  I'm going to run
tubes up to the front from the back tubes under the bench seat (was a 7
passenger bus) for heat...I wanted to block off the front from the
back.  Has anyone ever made a cab divider? How would one do it? is
cardboard good? or should i use some thinner wood?  Its a walk through,
so I figured maybe someone did it in a walk through split.  tis why its
on the vintage list.  Its for a 71.  So any input would be greatly
appreciated!

thanks
Isaiah
