Feel free to give me those rear seats, and the deluxe molding (Chrome dont

And Ill throw some bryce bumpers on there inplace of the pressed ones.
they should offer more protection.

&gt; I like the look of the center brakelight lid, but to do it right, you
&gt;  need to taillights to go with it.  The best of both worlds would be to
&gt;  wire the brake lights to one of the taillight circuitrs and use the 
&gt;  brakelight engine lid.  You could also install some large trailer lights
&gt;  as well, and some KC-HiLites on the roof, and...

...and a 6 inch lift, cut wheel wells, weld the replacement sheet metal on 
crooked ;)
