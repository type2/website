Hello List

I ran across a 60 Kombi in Michigan the other day.  It is 2 owner and the 
present owner feels that he is getting to old to work on his Bus.

The bus was originally purchased and used by a hardware store in south 
carolina.  In 1980 the present owner bought it.  1985 he moved to MI.  He 
has only driven it in the summer in MI and he says that it was garaged 
during 10 months of winter we have (it is 28 degrees out today)
It has frt bench and no back seats were ever in it.  He put a 1600 single 
port in it and beatle trans.  Other then that stock, 36mm RGB'S, front end 
etc.
The only rust he says that it has is some slight bubbling around window 
frames.  He says that he is asking 3000  but i feel that he wants it to go 
to good home.
If any of you are interested pmail me and I could probably look it over for 
you.
My Bus-------
65 Kombi  Soon to be on the road!!!  With new brakes, engine, transaxle, 
wiring harness, rubber seals, tires etc. etc. etc.(If it could be replaced I 
probably replaced it)

thats all
domonic
