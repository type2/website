   I have used a neat filter- it is about 2-2.5&quot; ID that 
has three magnets in it upstream of a large filter 
element. It was clear and very heavy duty, very nice. I 
should have bought a couple 'cause I haven't found one 
since.
   When Lisa and I went on our trip 
(http://busforsale.home.att_dot_net/pictures.htm) we were 
running one of the cheap little plastic guys. A bit of 
grit or something got past it and clogged the #2 
cylinder jet (dual carbs) one morning. Leaned it out and 
burned the exhaust valve seat before the motor had even 
fully warmed up (just getting on the onramp). 
Unfortunatly this happened in Fargo North Dakota! That 
put us out of commission for a week, where if we had 
been driving a John Deere instead of a &quot;Damn for'n car&quot; 
we would have had no problems getting parts!
   I now check that filter along with the oil whenever I 
get gas.

When I first started drving my '55 westy, I was plugging 
up filters like no tomorrow.  I ran 2 of them in series, 
and *both* of them got clogged.  There has to be a 
better filter out there.
