Subject: Spark Plug Blow Out
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2000 08:36:47 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

On the way to the Anderson Show in Crystal Lake yesterday, the spark plug
blew out of the number two cylinder. I screwed it back in only to have it
blow out again when the engine started.
When I got to the show I coated the plug threads with JB Weld and let it sit
while I was at the show, unfortunately this was only a few hours and not
long enough to let the epoxy set up.

What can I do to repair this short of pulling the engine and replacing the
head?
I talked to a couple of guys at the show who say the JB Weld solution works
pretty good?
Others told me to get a &quot;heli-coil?&quot; and others mentioned an &quot;insert&quot; but,
never having to deal with this in the past I'm a little puzzled.

I'd appreciate some suggestions. I made it to the show and back, but I won't
drive it this way again.
