&gt; Has anyone had to adjust the door gaps on a Bus?  On the Panel I've got
the
&gt; gap on the &quot;handle side&quot;  is a bit excessive.  How are these adjust to
bring
&gt; the door back slightly?  I remember from my Body Work days we use to shim
&gt; the doors when they didn't have an adjustment there.  These door don't
seem
&gt; to lend them self to shimming or adjusting much.

I have the opposite problem on my '65 DC. The gap on the &quot;handle side&quot; is
too small. In my case, it appears that the door has been damaged near the
lower hinge. Is there any damage at this location on yours? Also, check the
pillar the door is bolted to (&quot;A&quot; pillar?). Is it damaged in any way?

The doors can be adjusted, but the plates the hinges bolt to in the pillar
only move top to bottom, not front to back. As you should know from your
body shop days, sometimes a movement up will open a gap on the bottom end of
the door and vice-versa based on the horizontal offset of the hinge
locations on the pillar.
