&gt; Is this too hot, I mean I CAN hold the stick, but I'd rather not.
&gt; Wanna get head temp gauge and oil tmep guage, just to set her up right.

Hi Al,
Well most volks can only hold an object if it is below 150F, so that does not 
sound too bad.  Of course having gauges would be the best way to figure out 
what is going on in there, and knowing what RPMs per MPH you are doing in all 
four forward gears would help greatly.  Since previously you have had so much 
fuel running into the engine it is a good bet that none of the self polishing 
the engine does in the first 500-1,000 miles has happened and cold be things 
got rougher with the ruined lubrication.

&gt; Idle mixture screw had little affect, making me think I need larger main, 
&gt; smaller pilot?

Best to install a rather small main jet like a 115 or a little smaller.  Then 
experiment with smaller and smaller pilot jets till the idle mixture screw 
functions.  Having too big og main jet can easily overshadow the pilot jet 
and the mixture screw becomes useless.  
  Once you have the pilot jetting correct try bigger and bigger main jets 
till you have no stumble when giving it the gas to take off from a stop/idle.

(Snip)
&gt; Still learning, hopefully not by too dangerous experimentation!
&gt; 
The school of hard knocks is hard and fraught with disaster, but if you take 
you time, read all you can and sometimes ask even stupid questions.  You can 
learn far more than any other way and be a much safer VW owner.
