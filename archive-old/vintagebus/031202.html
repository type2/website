Subject: new carb over haul trick was rings stuck to pistons? update

To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

After church I pulled and cleaned the plugs again and did a compression
check as well. I static timed it to 0 Degrees TDC.

I pulled the carb, a round bowl 30 pict-1, and on disassembly noticed
the accelerator pump cavity on the side of the carb was dry. After
blowing out all the passages I was still unable to get flow from the
bottom of the bowl to the accelerator pump. On the same casting 
on the bottom of the bowl as the intake for the pump, there is a 
brass plug. On closer inspection, I noticed this plug was drilled and
tapped. To remove it I took a spare bolt that holds the tail light
lens on 62 -67 us spec bugs. I filed off the end of it to the treads
and treaded it into the plug. The bolt head the head was about .5 cm
above the bowl top. I clamped some needle nose vicegrips to the bolt
shaft just below the head, inverted the carb held it tight and swatted
the vise grips with a hammer. The plug popped right off. Be careful if
you do this because if the check ball below it is not stuck as mine was;
you'll lose it in the dirt. I was able to get mine out by swatting the
bowl surface upside down on the plywood that i had set up under a
mango tree as a work bench. I cleaned it out and put the plug back on
by taping it back in with the tail light bolt.

After installation I was able to start the engine. After some more
fiddling I ran it between fifteen hundred and three thousand RPM
for five minutes. Then I did the compression check again the number 4
cylinder went up to 100 the others are still down or up only slightly.

I'm just stoked to have this thing running. Maybe with a little more
effort all four cylinders will be up.

and across the sea to our golden valley of Makaha...
goodnight world and Aloha
