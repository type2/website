Subject: Re: [VB] Rust cleaning

probably want to take the engine out, and get one of those neat cart things 
where it bolts to the bus and you can tip it over to get the underside with out 
self contorting.  rotiserrie.   ya.   Though a friend of mine had a bunch of 
foam and blankets and carefully rolled a bus onto its side onto them.   

how bad is the rust?  I mean sandpaper and power tools help.   some people 
love por 15.   do you have to cut out some bad areas?  

do you have a website w/pics?

I'm new to this site so I hope this works...

Anyways, I'm also new to restoring. What would be the best tools to get to
sand out the rust inside my engine compartment and the undercarriage of my
66 Bus?

Any help appreciated,

Kevin
