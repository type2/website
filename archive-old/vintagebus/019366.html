Hi everyone,

Here is the latest update on the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club (Chapter
of the national VVWCA) &quot;Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Festival&quot; in Auburn
Hills in May.  This is always a great Midwest VW weekend event, very laid
back and social, and because of that, many of us travel great lengths in
our VW's to attend.  This event is held at Volkswagen of America's
corporate headquarters in Auburn Hills, a northwestern suburb of Detroit. 
There are several changes to make note of.  Mark your calendars for a fun
road trip!
