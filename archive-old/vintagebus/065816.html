Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod/ heater tube lagging

&gt; Is it worth pulling out the rod to the rear or is there no need? 

Hi Paul,
You bet!  It is the only way to get both rear shift rod bushings replaced and 
completely clean and regrease the shift coupler tube.  Make sure to also 
replace both rubber seals on the ends of this rear shift rod tube to keep out 
future dirt and water!

&gt; One quickie - should the part of the heater tube beneath the cab floor and 
&gt; backwards have lagging on?

From the factory the lagging should only be from just behind the front beam 
backwards as can be seen in the VW bus shop manual in the front beam section. 
 Though it could be an aftermarket kit or DPO add on.
