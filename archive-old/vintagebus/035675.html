&lt;&lt; My speedo works fine, and so do the lights, I just wanted to make it look
right. Has anyone done a similar repair? Any suggestions, or things to be
aware of.
  &gt;&gt;I've been serious playing with speedo since about 1995.  What got me
started was a jewelry class I took in college.  The speedo bezel is attached
about the same way a stone is set into a ring.  They use what is called,
believe it or not a bezel tool.  Which is pretty much a screwdriver with a
rounded end.  The end of it looks like the curved part of a U.  To get the
bezel off you take a very small screwdriver and lightly pry the bezel away
from the speedo housing.  You may have to go around 4 or 5 times to get enough
clearance for the bezel to clear the housing.  Once the bezel and glass are
off you just undo the two slot head screws on the back of the speedo housing
and out pops the guts, face and all.  Then the drive unit can be disconnected
from the magnetic drive.  The reason for the magnetic drive is so the needle
doesn't break when you go backwards.  The main trouble with VW speedo's is
lubrication of the drive unit.  VW used some cosmic sort of whale oil (kinda
looks like ear wax-yuck!).  This stuff drys up into a solid mass after 30
years or so.  So a good cleaning an some luberplate will take care of things
while your in there.  I try and leave the faces and needles a lone.  The
needles tend to break and the oil from your fingers mars the speedo face, thou
I must admit I've had fun air brushing speedo faces.  Another one of my
strange hobbies :)
   Peace, Love, and this speedo tampering is probably against the law-so you
didn't hear this stuff from me.
