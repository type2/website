Subject: Naturalbus report 

Hello Guys and gals  Well another Naturalbus has come and gone  A good time 
was had by all About 90 buses, Worse rain I have ever seen on Friday night  
about 2 inches, Frank Biffal still built a fire :)  Cleared up and was great 
Sat,Sun.  The new Hilly Billy putt putt Champ is none other than Mr Frank (Chilli 
king, Who built that fire  ) Biffal ,  Jamie Auch won the tyed dyed motor. I 
dont think I have ever seen two guys with bigger smiles . Over a $1000.00 
raised for the Ronald Mc donald house,  Naturalbus gets a gold leaf on their 
donation tree . The carabus back for lunch on Sun. had about 40 buses way too cool . 
So all you who didnt come cause you are going to Boonaroo I hope you enjoy 
the crowd cause you missed the best campout and group of bus people ever,    
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
