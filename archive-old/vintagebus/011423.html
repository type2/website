Subject: Club Chatter Part Deux

Bus Karma being what it is, I wrote the following last night and
then wondered whether I should post it.  Low and behold, this
morning I see the note from Bill Bowman covering the same
subject.  Rather than rework what I wrote, I'll post it &quot;as is&quot;
though some is covered in Bill's post.
* * * * * * * *
Several questions have come up, starting with S*T* and ending
with NEATO, about newsletters and webpages.  I'm not Tom
Broulliette or David Easterwood or Bill Bowman so I won't speak
for them.  I can, however, speak to several issues near and dear
to bus owners who are also members of NEATO.

The various grumblings (at meet, online, etc.) have not gone
unnoticed.  No question, Old Bus Review publication is behind
schedule.

1)  As David Easterwood previously posted here, the next Old Bus
Review should be out in a week or so.  It will be the (late)
Mar/Apr issue, to be followed by a (late) May/Jun issue.  There
is general agreement that to provide the members what they paid
for, back issues _will_ be produced and mailed, just later than
the cover date.

2)  As David Easterwood also previously posted here, the NEATO
webpage is _secondary_ to getting out Old Bus Reviews.  NEATO
members pay for OBR, the webpage is free.  Those here who get a
daily dose of bus reading tend to forget those still depending on
analog, snail mail, communication.  They paid for their
newsletters without access to the webpage.  There is always the
option of making the NEATO webpage accessible to NEATO members
only.  The Type 34 Ghia Registry does this.

3)  The TTT directory (free to NEATO and LiMBO members) is at the
printer and will accompany one of the next newsletters.

4)  No one I know of at NEATO is &quot;bought&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; as implied by
several comments about S*T*.  NEATO is solvent enough to cover
printing, postage and insurance for events, and that's where the
bulk of membership money goes.

5)  Much of October, November and December 1997 was dedicated to
the publication of the &quot;Spec Guide&quot; in conjunction with the Split
Screen Van Club (England) and Bulli-Kartei (Germany).  Editing
time is editing time, whether on newsletters or books.  Those in
NEATO who did not buy a Spec Guide are missing a great deal of
good data, with (admitedly) a few errors and ommissions.

6)  Under Editor Tom Brouillette and guest editors the NEATO Old
Bus Review newsletter has consistently remained the best club
newsletter around.  I personally am in VVWCA, VWCoA, LiMBO, T34
Registry, NIVA, and SSVC so I have some point of comparison.  I
was also in S*T* ten years ago.  OBR is not a rehash of online
posts.  There have been a couple of cross-overs from Email to
OBR, but not much.

7) Editorializing myself a bit, there is bus life outside of
California.  Before the list split, while we were getting
detailed statz, I did a quick count of where list members are.
About 10% were listed as Californians.  Only 17% of the NEATO Old
Bus Registry hails from California as well.  East of the
Mississippi, east of the plains, east of the Rockies, I suspect
most of us don't care about dualing meets or S*T* at all, but are
more interested in saving and keeping buses on the road.

8) As the small print in OBR says, OBR is volunteers working on
their own time.  Tom Brouillette, David Easterwood, Scott
Stothers and others contribute their effort by writing, editing,
proofing, mailing, etc. I'm glad to be part of that effort where
I can.  OBR volunteers can only print what they get or write
themselves.
