 comes to

 Hi Michael,
 If your VW was made at least a couple of thousand or more numbers away then 
 you have a pretty good chance that it is going to be the correct part 
number. 
  Any closer and if it has any any wierd or extensive M-codes the bus might 
 have been sidelined to install factory accessories before the part change 
and 
 then finished after the changeover!  Clara has one of these buses.  Chassi 
 number too late for the pointy top corners speedo pod, but probably due to 
 factory installed safaris the chassi number is later than the official 
speedo 
 pod change over.    Eric&amp;Barb

yes- and I'd like to also say that the bus in question has a VIN only 36 
numbers away from the recorded change VIN.    So if the bus has a vin close 
to the change,  E&amp;B have it on the nose, the recorded change may by slightly 
off, especially if you have a model that is not exactly standard, which could 
be pulled off the line for something, such as 23 windows or double doors or 
extra M codes, then put back on in a different place.  But seeing a 62 bus 
with a pointy speedo pod dash, I would be hard pressed to believe it was 
original, and would look for evidence of a nose job and/ or dash replacement.

re: whether the parts will fit pretty much you do need to pay attention.   
Stuff like doors and aprons and shift linkage stuff will not fit if it is the 
wrong version of the part, unless hokey alterations are done.  I found a late 
box type shift coupler on the 59 truck I had.   Some one had drilled the rear 
shift rod and used the later version.   However, it did not go into reverse.  
I installed the correct shift coupler and voila, I got reverse.  The 
modification for the wrong part did not work properly.  I have seen a pull 
handle door on a 67 bus, but it had been put on by a DPO with hokey mods for 
where the mechanism latches.    Of course some stuff will, you can change 
transaxles, put a 67 version in a 61 bus and vice versa. I have later front 
suspension and transaxle in my 61 hardtop deluxe, no hokey mods needed, but 
If I didn't know that and went to get brake stuff and ordered by VIN I would 
get the part that didn't fit, as it has the later brakes now.  But if you put 
an early suspension in a 64-67 bus, where do you attach the steering damper? 
- the early ones have one end attached to the body of the bus.   And some 
stuff is cosmetic, do you want green or beige or hardboard sunvisors?  They 
will all fit the same w/o mods.

But the parts list is a great reference.   Even says so in the Idiot Book, 
that Peter Ashwanden (the artist) love sthe VW parts list.  Doesn't it show 
in his drawings?
