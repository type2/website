  &gt; &lt;&lt; I would rather have a stock non-counterweighted crank than a cheap

  Hi Jack,
Would you mind telling us what type of problems you have had/seen with the 
welded counterbalance cranks?  So far we have been very happy with the one 
and only welded CW crank we have been using for the last 40,000 miles.  We 
definitely think that these should only be used for stocker non-drag racing.

  &lt;&lt;The ones I saw fail were, indeed, used on larger engines. They were not 
only welded at the counterweights, but the stroke offset was welded...  that 
is they cut the crank and moved the position of the journal in relation to 
the true-axial center to make the stroke longer...you know what I mean.... 
The crank failed at the case journal, as well as at one of the rod journals, 
and we all decided after some discussion that is was probably due to the 
welding proccess weakening the hardened steel at the journals....
 The welds were also just plain ugly. The workmanship was not good. The end 
clearance between rods and journal was huge and hugely different from rod 
journal to rod journal, even on the ones that didnt spin....this is all from 
memory...I didn't take notes. I do remember that it was a 2180cc or similar 
sized engine, and it seemed silly to me that someone would spend sooo much 
money on an engine and then skimp on the crank. I saw one other welded-up cw 
units, and was also not impressed with the look of the welds.  I would still 
spend the extra and go with a forged one.&gt;&gt;
         Yes definitely.  For the big and especially the bigger bore engines 
welded rod/crank journals to increase strock seems insane to us.  The 
material welded in would be of a differant alloy than the crank material and 
you would never be totally sure that it would be melted into the stock 
material enough.  On top of all that the new alloy added on material would be 
of a compleatly differant hardness unless the modifying company is annealing 
and reharding the whole crank!

&lt;&gt;
This would be mostly be due to the amount of cranks they want to have made.  
This number is almost always huge enough for the car company to invest either 
in in shop tooling to forge, cut, heat treat, and grind the new cranks or 
contract with crankshaft manufacturing company to have thier cranks made from 
scratch.  Either way it is much easier and more importantly to the car maker 
less expensive to just have the whole crank made from billet material or 
cast, and/or forged, cut, heat treated, ground than to weld counter wieghts 
to the crank.  Since couterwieghts do not experience the high pressure that 
the small weld surfacse are to hold this new material to the crank it does 
not suprise us that this would come apart.  Since the welded counterwieghts 
are only subjected to centrifugal force, and have large areas of weld to 
adhere them to the crank they should easily hold up to the task in lower RPM 
and 69mm throw stocker uses.  At least we think, and never have heard 
otherwise so far.  Has anyone else heard of welded CW crank failure with 
stock 69mm throw in stocker use?  Also does anyone have the prices of the CW 
cranks that are good quality one piece, and welded cranks?  It would be 
interesting to see how much $ differance there is.
