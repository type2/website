It's techinally feasible, but it depends on your HP and the terrain.
I know of somone who towed a 912 from LA to the Bay Area - with a
Karmann Ghia!

You'll know in the first few minutes how feasible it will be.  You'll
probably be OK if you keep it SLOW and hit the brakes well ahead of time.

&gt; Im going to get  my splitti this weekend !!
&gt; 
&gt; i never towed with a dolly, and for economic reason i will use my Westfalia
&gt; 1973 to tow it!!  I know you will say ...man your engine is gonna blow up,
&gt; man your tranny will blow....  !!
&gt; 
&gt; its 210 km from here, but my engine is a big bore 66 mm (1915 cc ) with
&gt; weber, and the weather is around 36-40 F those time!!
&gt; I also know a split is lighter in weight than a baywindow!!  The splitties
&gt; is having all tire inflated and no brake is seized!!
&gt; Do you think my tranny could keep up ??  no major hill , almost flat land to
&gt; cross!!   i plan to travel at 45-50 mph...
&gt; 
&gt; The reason i think its possible, i saw few image from split towing light
&gt; camping trailers in the sixties... and it was 1600 cc...then a 2000 cc
&gt; should easily handle it!!
