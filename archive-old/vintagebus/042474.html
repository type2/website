Subject: more 61 progress...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10004031532480.44287-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

I made quite a bit of progress on the 61 this weekend...

First off, all the wheels brakes and everything are back together (might
have already mentioned this) and i have mounted the tires on the hubs its
ready to drop to the ground, but i am going to wait until its engine
install time to put it back down, in case i need access to something under
there.

Accelerator pedal is reassembled and installed in the bus.  I still havent
covered the holes from the PO hack though :(

Shifter installed and lubed.

Cluch cable lubed and installed.

I put in a new throttle cable and it seems to be a fair shake too long...
the package says 55-64, and my gas pedal is fixed to factory, whats going
on here?

I put my big ass group 24 battery back in, (fits great, cheapest battery
out there) All lights/wipers/etc. work except the right rear blinker/brake
light.  I think its just the bulb.  The license light needs a little help
too but i think thats just dirty contacts. Also the rear blinker is
invisible, but i think thats because the turn signal flasher is still a 6
volt unit... its a wonder it hasnt caught on fire! It clicks like its on
some serious speed freak trip.

then I Put all the popouts back in.  I ran across a couple of good spares,
so all of em are nice and sound, no delaminations (for you vintage glass
freaks all but 2 are Silga logo)

Big bummer of the night! as this is my first splitty i didnt quite
understand how to operate the latches and busted one of my long spoons!
DOH!  I busted the long potmetal part that goes from the base to the
spoon.  right where the hole is forthat rubber bumper thingy. I have an
idea how to fix it, not correct but it'll be serviceable (drill a couple
of holes through the potmetal on either side of where it snapped.  use a
piece of appropriately sized square steel stock to reinforce with matching
holes drilled/tapped. assemble with threaded steel painted silver so as
not to stick out like sore thumb)

I have found a used type3 engine that may well get me going while i build
a million mile bionic balanced wonder.  Unfortunately, i'll need to use a
electric fuel pump with it as it has no provision for a mechanical fuel
pump... but i can put a killswitch to it hidden somewhere to save me from
theft at least somewhat.  the PO had an electric fuel pump to power his
bugspray carbeurated, no air filter, mismatched heads, j tube, four outlet
monza exhaust, no front or rear tin wonder, but that pump is loud as heck!
At least the wirings there already ;)  I hope the engines good, i already
have a few nonrebuildable cores in my garage.

Take care all,

Steve
