I understand your reasoning for keeping it unique, but if it's so far gone that you're gonna have to replace most everything anyway - then what's the difference? Keep the bus and replace most all of the parts or transfer the lunchwagon stuff to another bus - either way it's not going to be original, but at least you're keeping the cool accessories alive.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Basically what someone needs to do is take a double-door and move the

&gt;  enough project as it is... &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, then it wouldn't be so unique then, would it? I don't know why this 
&gt; bothers me so much, but it does. If you were to take another panel and 
&gt; convert all of the lunch bus stuff to that, then where is the authenticity of 
&gt; it actually being a coachbuilt. It's like turning kombis into deluxes. I 
&gt; understand the current panel needs lots of work, and would be real expensive, 
&gt; but owning a one off bus like that would be well worth it. Or cheaping out 
&gt; and loosing the vin # and M # from the original will make up for the money to 
&gt; be made when it would be sold to Japan when done. Don't say it cant be fixed, 
&gt; I bet Kelly could.
