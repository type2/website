Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

&gt; I have not talked to the owner of the tire place yet. I want to see if they
&gt; are balanced correctly before I inform him of the problem. This is a VERY
&gt; small town and will need him in the future, and he also is a client at my
&gt; business. It was his employee that messed up and I am sure he will not do it
&gt; again when the owner finds out.

I hope you dont overtorque his dog next time it comes in.
Or maybe warp his cats brake drums.
