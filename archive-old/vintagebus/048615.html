Your best bet is to enroll in some body classes at a local college, junior
college, or vocational school.  Not only will you save a ton of money, but
you will be learning a new skill and get more personal with your bus!!


&gt;I was wondering if there were any of you within a reasonable distance to me
&gt;that could help me replace my dogleg with an used factory one.  I also need
&gt;some help on some MINOR pass rocker repair.  The part that needs to be
&gt;replaced is the upper part that goes  over the rubber seal.
&gt;
&gt;If none of you could help me do you know of any decent body shop.  The only
&gt;good ACVW body shop i could in MI has a 3.5 year wait.
