&gt; &gt; I've noticed that none of the Vintage Nazis have any criticism for Kyle,

&gt; &gt; I'm planning some major hacks on my '67...  Where is the line between
&gt; &gt; earning respect and drawing criticism?
&gt; Everyone agrees that the Westfailure is a crime against nature, but Kyle's
&gt; plea is &quot;Hey, I didn't do it, it was the DPO. Besides, it's one damn fine
&gt; tow vehicle.&quot;

Besides, it's living proof of what happens when you put two VW buses, a
large american V8 drivetrain, tools, and a large quantity of beer in the
same garage!
