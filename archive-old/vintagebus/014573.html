Pomona report.
Drove my 58 single cab to pomona to have some fun in the rain.
Noone wanted to give me money for it so I drove home.
Its a good thing I didnt sell since the rod bearings in the old 36 went south 
and it devloped a HUGE rod KNOCK on the way home! 
I stopped and had to tow it 50 miles to my home. =(
It didnt throw a rod...but..........
Guess my 58 singlecabs gonna have my rebuilt 1600 single port at havasu!

&lt;&lt; Hi all,


Had a nice time out at Pomona. Lots o vendors. Some good

parts, some bad. The usual stuff. Got a couple of leads on a

passenger door for my 64. Eric said he has several and Jim

from TJ says he has a good one. Ronnie says he may have one

too. Looks like a trip to Phx. Bought some POR-15 to try

out. Will report later. Tried Ras-O-Nil for rust clean up

and corrosion protection. Left a piece of steel after

treatment in a dish of salt water for a week before any rust

became visible. Not too bad. May use it as a base coat when

I strip parts of the bus.


All for now.

Chris
