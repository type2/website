Hi Matt,
First you look for wide five lug rims.  Most will have VW stamped on them 
near the lug holes, those that have a manufacture name starting with &quot;Les&quot; 
are older rims.  If you find any with a diameter of 17&quot;, give us a call and 
we will take them off your hands.  ;-)  The 1955-67 bus ones will have the 
four slots between the inner lug bolt section of the rim and the outer tire 
mounting part of the rim.
