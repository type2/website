That's what I'll do.

Thanks for  you help

What size tires did you say you are running  205/70/15?

Richard  &lt;&lt;&lt;





Hi Richard,
Yes that is the size we are running.  They are as close to the 1955  thru 
early 1964 stock tire diameter as you can get today in a radial, and  are two 
inches bigger than the ones you are running now.  Just with the  bigger diameter 
you will increase top speed, and get your speedo/odo to read  much more 
correctly.  If you have DPO cut out rear wheel  wells or the ones built after late 
1962 that are higher and wider, you can run a  bit bigger rear tires increasing 
your top speed again.
  Make sure you are running Bus rims before installing the larger  tires!!!
