Yes, mine gradually got worse...then one day..i HAD to fix it...or suffer the
consequences of a funked up tranny.  Also...keep in mind...just because its
new...doesn't always mean its good.  I've bought brand new parts that were
worse than the broken ones I already had!
I'm contemplating the pull of my engine tonight...  like you say...sitting in
front of the computer is much more comfy than that cold driveway (its chilly
here now too!) but it would make things go so much faster tomorrow....hmmmmm

&gt;  If I have to pull the motor tonight, I'm going to... going to... well,
&gt; do it.  I just don't want to.  Thanks for your help, all.  Anxiously
&gt; awaiting responses.  (Computer desk is more comfortable than the
&gt; driveway.)
