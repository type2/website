list:
i would like to discuss the possibilities
of a roller crank with someone who has
a working knowledge.
for the uninformed, this is a crankshaft
which is pressed together in pieces,
the connecting rods do not bolt on, they
are solid and ride on roller bearings.
the crankshaft also is not drilled to
supply oil to the rods, they are fed by
splash and oil-mist lubrication from a
main bearing modification. they also
seem to lack a red-line, or rpm limit ...
www.geneberg_dot_com has an entertaining
dialogue on the roller crank.
if anyone has machinist  background
and / or personal experience with this gizmo,
i have just a couple of questions.
