Friends,

I didn't know Josh personally, but I recognised him as an intelligent, true type2 enthusiast, and he did privately respond to a few posts of mine. I am sorry he is no longer with us.

I recently went through a similar state of mind myself, unsuccessfully. My friends could see I was severely depressed, but they had no idea how deep the hole I was in. I called Charlie Ford one night for some help, and he spent a couple of hours on the phone with me, which helped for a couple of days. When you are in that state of mind, nothing anyone says or does for you seems to matter very much. All I can say is that if you have even the slightest idea that someone might be suicidal, try to talk them into checking into a hospital, or get thier family to check them in. Some signs to look out for are: neglecting normal household duties, neglecting needed work on the bus, withdrawal from friends, excessive alcohol use, no appetite... I could go on, but maybe you get the idea. Medication will help, I know. 

Been there,

david
