This is a description of the splash pan as i know it. i have only seen one, 
on my 64', it is (as i understand it) a horizontally positioned plate that 
fits between the rearmost bumper and the body of your bus. the ONE that i 
have had fit directly over where the stock exhaust pipe end would be 
located.
I could be mistaken
