&gt; I've noticed that none of the Vintage Nazis have any criticism for Kyle,
&gt; with his V8 powered Westfailure, or Richard, with his late pop '67...
&gt; I'm planning some major hacks on my '67...  Where is the line between
&gt; earning respect and drawing criticism?
&gt;

Everyone agrees that the Westfailure is a crime against nature, but Kyle's
plea is &quot;Hey, I didn't do it, it was the DPO. Besides, it's one damn fine
tow vehicle.&quot;
