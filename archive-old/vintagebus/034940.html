 Are the 67 MC's rebuildable or should I go ahead and get the 71+ non
 servo and put it in? &gt;&gt;
Hi Tim,
Saw that you figured out what was mixed up in your 1967 MC.  The rebuild kits 
are availible for about $40.00 from NAPA, or you could go the 1971 and later 
route.  The latter would set you up with a system that can be repaired 
anywhere.   Eric&amp;Barb
