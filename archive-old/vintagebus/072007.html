i know somebody will pop in later with the exact time of change over but im
pretty sure its sometime in  '64.  i thought that when the 1500 became
standard it came with the big nut tranny.

ya,  it was a model year change. 64-67 was big nuts with 1.26 reduction, 63 
and earlier was 36mm nuts with 1.39 reduction.  except........... a bunch of 
63s ( 1 ton Mcode) came with the one ton 'little big nut RGBs', which was 36mm 
and 1.26 redux and the same bigger brakes as the 64-67 with unique hard to find 
drums, and rare rare rare rare rare is the mountain gears for 64-67 which are 
big nuts and 1.39 reduction.  I think a NOS set of the latter are FS on 
thesamba.   also really rare are early mountain gears, which are lower than 1.39, 
but I don't know the number off hand.  

Basically, big nuts are higher geared, and have bigger brakes.
and the lower outer on the big nut is the pricey one.
