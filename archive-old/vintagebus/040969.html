I have been listening to all the talk the last couple days about cooling
problems and I think that you Arizona guys must absolutely be crazy to drive
an aircooled VW in the summer without AC.  I always park my aircooled VWs
when it gets over 80 (my maximum comfort level) and I also park them when it
snows only because the Chicago salt wreaks havoc on floorpans and such.
That is why I have the New Beetle...to help preserve my old VWs.

Luckily we are having the coolest summer in ages to I am driving them a lot.
God I hate hot weather!!
