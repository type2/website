Subject: new engine runs!
Mime-Version: 1.0


Yup, in a few short hours, tom mink and I got the new engine assembled and
running.  what took the longest was re-doing the engine compartment wiring
for the regulator, and general wiring cleanup.  I even put the back bumper
on and everything is &quot;dialed in&quot; - I'm driving it to work tomorrow!
