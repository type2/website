&lt;&lt; So tommarrow I'm gonna get the fuse box mounted back up. How exactly 
 DOES the fuse box mount up? Does it just pop in or is there supposed 
 to be some kind of holder to keep it in place?
 
   I have used a 4 or 5 mm bolt with a wide washer and nut to hold in a
 couple of my fuse blocks. Works great, just don't over tighten and crack the
 block

hm, I can't quite envision where you put the bolt.

Hi Rex,
There is supposed to be a steel clip that locks the right side of the fuse 
box to the frame.
......................
isn't it on the left side of the fuse box?


I have seen them siliconed in place,  sort of permanent, but worked

but you can get a clip from WW I think.  I got one somewhere mail order for 
the 67 riviera.
