From listening to Bill Collins' presentation on the subject at the
Kelley Park dinner, the average joe doesn't have a snowball's chance
in hell of seeing that $250k.

BTW, the Great Race is a time-and-distance rally, and not a true race.  

The professional teams, who are the ones who actually have a shot
at the money, have entire semis full of support equipment and spare
parts, and teams of mechanics who go over the car each and every night.
I'm willing to be that with this kind of effort, even if you *did* win,
you *might* break even.

&gt; The $4,000.00 after discounts for private parties would still be a hunk of

&gt; the rules the auto to be entered has to be a pre-1960 race car or motorcycle, 
&gt; all other cars must be pre-1951.  So it looks to us that one would have to 
&gt; enter a 1950 BD or if you could get VW to release the 49 prototype to you.....
