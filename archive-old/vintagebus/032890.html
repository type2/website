 anyway, i may have a lead on a 63 for a spare, but cant recall the exact
 differences in a 63 transaxle as compared to 62 and older...
 
 i/e i know the drum and stub axle are different, i seem to recall a bit
 longer on the axle and snout, but by how much?
 
 wow, i have posted a lot today, i must be revved up by all my work
 yesterday.
 
 peas,

a 62 is only different from a 63 if the 63 has the optional i ton 
suspension/brakes package.
