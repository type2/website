there is no copyright i see on my copy, but i am extremely hesitant to loan
books-they never seem to get back to me.  i will think about it though.

&gt; At the risk of getting the copyright police up in arms... if anyone has
one 
&gt; of these they will loan I will happily scan (and return) and provide to 
&gt; Thom, if he agrees, for inclusion in the Docs section of VintageBus.  
&gt; Takers?  Thom?

&gt; &gt;May I suggest for all to read, if you can find a copy, is a book called 
&gt; &gt;&quot;SOLEX-SELECTION AND TUNING OF THE CARBURETOR &quot;  by the
&gt; &gt;ARNOLT CORPORATION (sorry to all the librarians, no other info
&gt; &gt;as far as cataloging). It's long out of print, but is invaluable
&gt; &gt;for nit-picky carb info.
