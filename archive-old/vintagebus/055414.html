Hi Doug,
As far as we have been able to tell the main differance is country of 
manufacture which means less cost in worker wages.  We have not had any 
problems with Brazilian brake cylinder and have been able to get over 100,000 
miles out of them with regular 30,000 mile or every two years maintenance of 
cleaning all the cylinders out and putting in new brake fluid.   Eric&amp;Barb
