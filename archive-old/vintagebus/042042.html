&gt; The far right hand fuse in the fuse box gets extremely hot when the lights
&gt; are switched on. This fuse seems to be the most heavily loaded of all, since
&gt; it seems to handle the main power supply from the starter (battery), as well
&gt; as serving the headlight circuit and a couple of others.

fig
you might want to get the wiring diagram and have a good look. The main
current for the lights and ignition should not actually go through the
fuse. The path should come from the terminal on the starter and go to the
top of that fuse but it should parallel then to the light and ignition
switches without passing through the fuse. if the wiring is correct then
possibly there is a bad crimp or nearly broken wire there somewhere.
