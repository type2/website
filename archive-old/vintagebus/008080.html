I just got back from a little 15 minute jaunt with the bus.  The Webers kind
of sqeaked and popped for the first minute while they warmed up.  I can say
I've definitely got more power than I had before and my quick little 4 mile
stretch at 67mph was done with little effort.  After coming back into town,
I backed in to the driveway and did the dipstick test and things were warm
but not uncomfortably so.  Another nice thing I noticed is that I've got
power past the shift points on the bus speedo - nice plus if need be.

When I shut it down, it stopped rather quickly but I would suppose that is
due to the new engine, dual valve springs, etc.  I guess it deserves
asking - will my aluminum pushrods be affected by running 1.25 rockers with
the dual 044 valve springs?  Since I'll be caravanning with Terry Wolfe in
his bus, he is running a stock setup so he told me he is 45 up hills and 55
down which translates into 3rd gear and 4th gear for me.  3rd is 45 to 50
and 4th comes next.

I better get back to the shop - I gotta get the deep sump on, vdo temp
sender hooked up, and the stereo installed.  Later!
