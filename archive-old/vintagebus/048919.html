Harry and List:

Don't waste your time on the Ventura show, unless your looking for *junk* other than VW.  I decided to bop down to the Ventura show in May.  It's only a 25 minute drive for me.  There was one poor soul selling a few VW tidbits, a seized 36 hp motor, some fuel pumps, a coupla knobs.  It was a joke.  I did happen to buy a few bodyworking hammers and dollies for around $12.

The ad always sez VW, but it's mostly Corvette, hotrods and American truck stuff.

Robert
