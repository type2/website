I got my 1966 Double Cab back on 4 wheels yesterday.  I pushed it all
over the yard... I guess I have a strang idea of exercise.  I have so
many questions.  I don't know where to start on the bus.  The cab floor
in the front seat is almost gone.  I bought the two patch panels but
they leave a big gap in the middle.  Does anyone sell that panel, or do
I have to make it?  I have to replave the rocker under the 3rd door
also.  There are a few visiable hole around the windshield, what sould I
do about that?  I was thinking sand blast them and weld the holes shut,
and the grind them down.  The passenger side dogleg is in bad shape, how
much do they cost, and how hard is it to replace it.  the drivers side
is not great, but it is better than the passenger side.  How hard it it
to install the IRS transmission kit?  Are the lower spindles worth the
money?  If I install a IRS transmission, and 3.5&quot; lowered spindles what
kind of rim/tire combo am I going to need to get?  I have a number of
14&quot; bus rims, but they are in ruff shape.  could I go with empi 5
spokes?  Does anyone have patch panels for the bed floor?  It has one
had hole and some pin holes.  I was thinking of sandblasting it and
fiberglassing the holes from the bottem, and the getting the bed sprayed
with Rhino Liner.  The truck is in really bad shape.  It has been
sitting in the south for atleast the last 15 years.  I want to get it
back on the road.  I have never driven a bus, but just sitting in my
truck is awsome!  I have some pictures on my web site it you are
interested, I haven't updated it in a while.  My bug has kinda taken all
my time away from the truck, but the bug is almost done, so there will
be a place for it in the garage here soon.  If anyone can help me please
e-mail me. I promised the lady I bought it from that I would fix it up,
and I am not going to let it just sit in my yard.  It wants and needs to
be back on the road.  I have only seen 1 other split window double cab
on on eastcoast, I know there are more, but I have only seen 1. 
Thanks   Jeremy
