&gt;A couple co-workers saod they saw a huge gathering of
&gt;VW's in Citrus Heights yesterday.  I'd seen a few more
&gt;VW's running around the streets, but attributed it to
&gt;the nice weather.

My wife and I drove up to Roseville on Saturday and while driving north on 5 (I think we 
were crossing 12 ...was it 21?) I saw a small caravan of four bugs and a bus down on a 
city street.  My wife's so cool, she asked if I wanted to follow them.  We didn't, but I 
wonder if they're connected to the Cit Heights deal?
