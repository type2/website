Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

i don't think there is any physical way for the long spring to fit in the
front (short) relief hole, especially with a plunger in there too. i could
see the short one in the rear hole though, but the long one in the short?
i'd like to see that.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt;   Could they have meant the plungers?  Or was the long spring and the
short
&gt; spring reversed.

&gt; Well, it turns out that the springs in the oil pump were reversed. Not
&gt; sure how *that* happened, but just glad that it's well again. I'm going
&gt; to pick it up now...
