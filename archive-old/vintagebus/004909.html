list :
i'm doing my first two splitties, 66 and 67 standard.
i don't have a good knowledge of the vintage yet.
i am in western new york, not much chance of local
used parts, and i need lots ...
i think clara  mentioned splittie glass pop-outs could be
had for $ 10-15 each , i need  a dozen ! my glass is
mostly sigla, the few parts on these busses without rust,
but the frames are rusted out. i don't know if the glass
will mount alone, or if frames can be found to fit them..
also looking for a set of roof glass, i have the clip to fit...
making a 19-window bus !  i would like to connect with
a used parts source... anybody ?
