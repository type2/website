&lt;&lt; It looks like it came out of a bus, 'cause it has that triangular air

Hi Kayabo,
That could be for a KG also, since they used the same air cleaner as the bus. 
 The muffler on it does look like it probably is a single tip which most 
likely would have been used on a bus, but would have fitted a bug or KG if 
someone wanted to be wierd enough.   Eric&amp;Barb
