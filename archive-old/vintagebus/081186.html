Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch thump

I had clutch issues with my 61 after replacing he TO arm.... I pulled the 
motor and messed with stuff like 5 times.   Chattering... sometimes bad, 
sometimes abysmal, some times slightly irritating.   Anyway, after the nth attempt I 
said, well,  F%^&amp; it, and shortly left on the trip south...   and noticed that 
sine I got to the bay area the clutch seems happier.... so maybe if you drive 
it it'll heal itself.

maybe

or check yr tranny mounts

This is the second clutch that does this, but when I clutch to shift I get a 
thump sound, only when engaging under load.  In other words, shift into 1st, 
no thump.  Clutch to shift into second, thump.  Release clutch, no thump, 
Clutch for third, thump, ect.  9 spring and now diaphram, same thing, only 
thing I haven't changed is the TOB, no noise when clutch is engaged, no 
noise when released when not under load.
