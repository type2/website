Guess I'll have to get one of those cool little tin oil cans with the 
squirter connection.  I just can't see slopping the stuff on the door 
straight out of the bottle, kind of messy.  

It's amazing how easily you can repair a busted door lock with just a few 
squirts of oil.  Squeeze it in till it runs back out and then try the key 
again.  WOW!  Or your lock truly is busted.  My rear hatch refused to open no 
matter how hard I yanked and pulled.  I oiled the lock and now it practically 
opens itself.  Simple solutions.  It's always a simple solution.  In 
frustration it's easy to overlook the obvious.
