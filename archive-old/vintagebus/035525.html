ok yes its screwed on PHILLIPS HEAD.  unless some jackass added some
flatheads.  but the BIGGEST THING! is DO NOT get frustrated and start PULLING
IT OFF.  you will bend and crease the piss out of it.  if its in the junkyard
not EVERY screw will come out most likely the screw heads are RUSTED to piss.
 Under where they had the rubber stripping for a long time is the good ones.
the exposed one tend to rust better.  The rubber stripping just pulls out
with the pry of a screw driver to get it started then pulls out.  SO DO NOT
JUST RIP THE trim off the screws.  best thing to do on a junker POS that is
REALLY rusted is to open the popouts or just take them those are worth money
too!  and usually the window sill is really rusted too.  Then PRY from the
Gapping rust hole in the window sill and pry it open so you can get to the
back of the screw along the belt line and use a vice grips or i perfer
Channel Locks to either break off the screw or loosen it up by turning it.
just follow from the inside of the bus you can get to just about every screw.
 ALSO TAKE THE HACK SAW!  comes in handy!  On really rusty busses the rocker
comes off with the trim.  hope this helps.  sorry for the destructive bus
content. but gotta do whatcha gotta do!
