&gt; I say again, fix the factory heater right, dress for the occation and
&gt; enjoy the ride!

Maybe he is silly but he is right! Check the system for leaks and seal where
necessary. Make sure the control boxes are ALL the way open. Make sure you
have working flaps so the motor reaches correct operating temp. Good German
heater boxes(with finns) are best. Good window and door seals are also part
of the equation. When everything is as it should be the stock heat set up
works surprisingly well.

I ran across I guy with a bus this weekend who was sporting the little buddy
heater and that would be nice to thaw the bus out before you crawl in to go
to work. Underway, stock heat can keep you warm.

Gotta get that overhead vent to seal though.
