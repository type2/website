A few months ago I posted to the list that I had found a diesel heater,found
in a junked semi tractor.
This heater is very compact(it is topedo shaped 5&quot; diameter by 13&quot; long),
German made, very very effecient and easily converted to gasoline.
I finally installed this in my bus in April.the heater has been working
great , except for when I first installed it and hadn't converted it
correctly to gas.It is made by Webasto and it's model name is &quot;Air Top
18&quot;.It is designed to keep the sleeping cabin of semi's,campers or cars warm
while you sleep.I have sent to Germany and received a complete set of
operating manuals and replacement parts manuals.There are NO moving parts in
the entire unit(except the fuel pump).It is deemed VERY safe and has many
safety switches built in.( If you are interested pmail me and I will
elaborate.)You can run it in a closed up vehicle.The heater was built in
1993 and are still made today, though they cost about $1200.
I bought mine for a $100 from a scraper, though I did have to buy $70 worth
of parts to convert it to gas.
The heater is thermostaticly controlled and will bake you out of your bus,
if you desire.I tapped it right into my fuel line ,I only have to fill up
with gas and I'm set.(no running to the propane dealer and no extra tank).
The down side is I had to drill 14 holes in my bus to install it ! A small
price ,I feel for something SO useful.
You SoCal guys won't understand.When my club,the dbg , would go camping(the
sites without electricity )
I was tired of all the bubble window guys with their propane heaters being
toasty warm and me freezing my arse off.

Here's a link to there English portion of their site.
http://www.webasto_dot_de/englisch/d_produkte.htm
click on thermo-systems then camping units.

If anybody wants more info, feel free to pmail me and I will try to help !!
