&lt;&lt; I am going to bid on some key blanks that Gabriell's Locks has for sale on 
 ebay.
 
 I have a 59' panel and want to know what I need to look for on my door 
 handles.---
 Do I need a the Letter part of the code to decide what blank is correct?\
 
 I dont know much about this subject, so please enlighten me--
  &gt;&gt;
you need the style key where the code is number-letter-number, such as 2Z3.  
this style was used 54 through 63, though the barndoors used a different key 
for the ignition, the postbarndoors through 63 used this profile for all 
locks, unless there was a steering/ig lock.    

 However, you can get the cutout blanks for $10 ea, so don't bid more than 
that
