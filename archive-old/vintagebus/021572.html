A friend of mine picked up a couple of &quot;bus&quot; greeting cards in Santa Cruz.  
The card is a '65 blue and white 21 window deluxe.  The card cost $2.50.  
 
The company that produces the card has a website with a store locator
feature.  Here's a link to a picture of the card:

Pretty cool for a couple of bucks.
