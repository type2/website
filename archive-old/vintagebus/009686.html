Thanks Woody for the info on replacement parts available for domestic camper
conversions, this has me thinking about ripping into the interior of my bus.
I need some windows too, the regular glass in mine are falling out piece by
piece.
So, If I'm going to jump into this project, I'm wondering if there's advice
on the list...
I am about to rebuild the interior of my EZ camper. It looks like the
existing camper interior is made up of odds and ends from several different
interiors. The wood shades and grains are of several varieties, and the
outside panel contours where the wood meets the inside walls of the bus do
not match up.
I have asked Amazon to search for a book mentioned in this newsgroup which
contains plans for a VW camper interior, however I understand now that these
interior plans are for a bay window, and I am working on my 66 split.
I am inviting anyone who has had experience with this to pitch in with ideas
and tips. If someone had actual plans and measurements for the panels for
cupboards, headliner, and wall panels I would be glad to ante-up for
expenses, shipping or whatever required. The PO installed some extremely bad
paneling on the wall of the driver's side and that definitely has to go.
There's some brown shag carpeting on the floor, and that's dumpster-bound as
well...unless Brian Wittling can find some stink-foots that want it.
BTW, no scoops for me please, except at Baskin Robbins.
Thanks in advance for the help.
