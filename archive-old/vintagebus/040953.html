&gt;Is there an electronic copy of the Type 2 Bentley around ?


Not yet, but there will be.  Bentley is in the process of putting all of
their manuals on CD-ROM.  They use an html format that works on both PC and
Mac.  So far the only one available is for the Vanagon, with the others
slated for sometime next year.  I am factory-direct with Bentley and will
definately have them as soon as they're out (at listmember pricing), so when
they're available, you'll hear it here first...
