&gt; Hi JT,
&gt;
&gt; 12volt power consumes my life, living in a 1987 Bluebird bus.  Also work
&gt; computers all day... so use power.

Of course, that slide-out APU generator on the Wanderlodge is bigger than
a bus engine!  :)

&gt; Live in a sunny climate, solar cells on that nice roof :)

Not a bad idea!  I know a fellow who has all his camping electrics in his
bus run from solar panels.  The prices for these is coming down bit by
bit.
