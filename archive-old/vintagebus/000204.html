Hi again Mark,
Forgot to mention you should check for wear, and tear in the starter bushing. 
 Also you would be best off to remove the starter, pull off the front cover, 
and clean out any, and all dust from the brushes wearing down.  Plus check 
these brushes to be longer than thier cages, or they are worn out, or near 
so.  Check positive cable, and reapir, or replace if nessary.  Eric&amp;Barb
