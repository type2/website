Hello list...

My right rear wheel cylinder on my '60 DC blew up a few days ago, and
although I was able to drive (I've got a dual master cylinder) with pumping,
I knew I had to fix it.  Might as well replace pads and cylinders on both
sides, right?  So I gets me parts, and finally got around to converting my
big torque wrench into a club, and shearing off another 1/2&quot; driver in the
attempts to loosen the axle nut.  So, off to J&amp;W in Sebastopol, where Hans
and Bob zapped those things loose for me, and Hans (lent/traded) a proper
3/4&quot; breaker bar for my socket.  Back to home, where tose things came off
nicely, and dissassembly of the leaky side first.

One of the first things I discovered was that in order to get the tire off,
I had to let the air out!  The tire itself is bigger than it should be, and
the space between the drum and the edge of the fender was not big
enough...oh well.  Got the parts off, and cleaned off the muck that was
everywhere, stuck a new grommet in the brake line holder thingy, and
pre-adjusted the brakes.  CAUTION!  When spinning a tire with the swing-axle
relaxed, there is not clearance for your finger between the tire and the
(sharp?) fender edge!  Ouch....that smarts!  I'll add this rather deep
injury to my list of stupid things not to do...one of the others being
chewing up my fingers between the flywheel teeth and the lower engine to
tranny stud!

Things progressed fairly normally after that....the other rear brake
assembly went back together well, and I learned that you gotta release all
the tension of the parking brake adjusters before you can get a good &quot;real&quot;
adjustment.  Now everything is almost too tight!  I may have to back off a
bit...

Later!
