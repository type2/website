Yeah, yeah, I know everyone's been thinking, &quot;I haven't heard from Everett
in a while, what's he been up to?&quot;  What?  You say that hasn't come to mind?
Liar!  Here's an update anyway, I know you want it.  Hey, it includes
another run-in with the cops...  Read on, Bus peoples:

It all started about 3 weeks ago.  I had finally decided to make the
interior panels for my Kombi.  The masonite had only been sitting on my
garage floor since before the June VW Classic, with me driving over it every
day to park, so now it's &quot;aged&quot;.  At least I drove over the back of it...
ha-ha.  Side note: 4x8 sheets of masonite WILL fit in the cargo area of your
Bus through the cargo doors, but it takes some maneuvering and it helps to
have no rear seats.  It also helps if you buy it and then realize that it
might not fit and are forced to try to slam it in there.

Luckily, I have a set of door panels off a '60 Single Cab sitting in my
garage so I had something to trace.  For the kick panels, I removed the
original panels off my under-destruction '54 Single Cab.  So... I traced the
panels with pen in hand and knee on weather-warped old panels and cleaned up
the lines with a ruler.  I traced on the face/front of the panels as I was
using a jigsaw to cut and the blade cuts face down.  I chose a super-fine
blade, I think it was for cutting linoleum (whatever... I use a razor blade
for linoleum), it had 12 teeth per inch.  Works well but I smooth the edges
with my hand or some super-fine sandpaper afterwards.  Test fit the kick
panels and adjusted the cutout for the Barndoor fuse box.

Next up was paint.  I pulled out a can of the Home Depot &quot;Professional&quot;
Machine Grey paint I used last time ('63 Single Cab a few years back, under
the responsible ownership of a listee now), test sprayed a scrap piece, and
noticed that it didn't match the color of the original panels at all.  Yeah,
the panels were dirty, but there was a super-clean spot where the center
kick panel covered the edge of the side kick panels.  Barndoors have 4-piece
kick panels, in case that sounds confusing.  Anyway, sounded like a
Quest(TM), which I'm always up for, so I took the panel with me and hit Home
Depot, ACE hardware, and my FLAPS when I got the super-dope tip that the
place for paint was Walmart.  All right, I'm there!  Found a color that was
very close to the original and it was $1 per can!  I had some doubts about
the quality, being the spray-paint connoisseur that I am, but it sprayed out
nice and smooth and coverage was superb.

After a few more trips to Home Depot for longer screws since the new panels
were a little thicker and thus harder to bend and screw in, I got the 2 side
panels and dash pod panel in.  Went to install the center kick panel and it
didn't fit over the heater tube!  Damn, must be the thicker-than-stock
masonite.  Of course, I'd painted it already...  Back to the saw!  Hacked on
it a little with the jigsaw a few times, never did fit right, eventually I
accidentally snapped it in two pieces.  Okay, back to the drawing board...
Took the original center piece and my now-busted piece and compared the
differences.  Okay, a little wider near the bottom of the panel, looks like
that'll do it.  Traced a new piece, cut, perfect fit!  Yeah, where's that
paint!?!

Next I pulled out a set of plastic (repro?) door pockets I found at the
junkyard a while back and compared them against the real pockets in my
Single Cab. It's nice having another Bus around as a point of reference...
Anyway, whoever did the form for the repros must have been on some sicko
weed that day because they weren't even close to lining up with the pattern
of the original pocket-mounting rivets.  Got a note from Rusty Van Bondo
saying he had a set, mistakenly thought he meant he had a set for sale but
it turned out they had some damage and wear so, forget it, I'm going with
the plastic repros.  A little color-matching paint, glue instead of rivets
to attach them, good as new!

Was starting a new job that Monday so I put aside the door panels in favor
of some preparatory work for the job.  Checked the Bus out, oil level,
points gap, timing, etc..  Bus looks good, should be ok on my new commute...
Wrong!   Made it to work and back Monday but coming home Tuesday in the dark
the Kombi began cutting out.  It was the same symptoms as about a month
earlier so, like that time, I stopped and blew out the jets.
That did it, started it back up and continued home.  About a mile from my
house, at the bottom of the highway off-ramp, right at a stop light, it
stalled and wouldn't start again.  Went to check things out, everything
looked fine, pulled the pilot jet again, let some fuel run out of the carb.
onto a rag to see if any dirt came out, checked fuel filter, everything was
clean.  Still wouldn't start and I messed with things for a while, checking
power to the coil, points, condenser, etc., when a cop pulls up.  &quot;We're
gonna have to get you out of the off-ramp, people come down this exit at 60
mph and you're gonna get hit.&quot;  I really had no option, the exit is in a
valley between 2 small hills and there's no emergency lane, so I say &quot;Ok&quot;.
Meanwhile, I'm thinking that if people are really coming down an off-ramp
that is 1/2 a mile long at 60 mph, shouldn't he do something about that?
Write some tickets, dammit!  He proceeds to push my Bus (via the ribbed
bumper - Doh!) to the right up a hill and into the Circle K parking lot.  I
call my wife and AAA and got it towed to my house.  A few days pass, I swap
carbs as a test and it fires right up but I can't use that carb. so I
rebuild the other one and make a mental note to rebuild my other 28 PICT
carb., too, as a spare.  I've been telling people to have a spare, too.  Oh,
well, do what I say, not what I do...  Slap in new points and plugs, the
points seem to have become pitted from all the cranking I've been doing.
Everything back to normal, or so I think.

Fast forward to the next Tuesday, I'm driving home from work, the Kombi
starts cutting out again at low rpms and stalling at stop lights.  What?  I
just rebuilt the carb!  I try to keep the rpms and my speed up just to make
it home but there's too many stop lights on the city streets.  I take a look
at the cap and rotor and they look real dirty so I polish the contacts up
with a piece of sandpaper.  My new spares are sitting at home, of course.
That lasts for a few miles with some minor cutting out so I attempt to stop
at an auto parts store along the way but surprise, surprise, they don't have
a cap or rotor for a 1955 Bus. The desk guy was the owner of a nice red Bug
and said he had some spares so we went out to the parking lot.
Unfortunately, he realized that he had left them at home, too!  So I
continue on my way.  It stalls a few more times but it restarts after about
a minute each time.  Finally, I'm about a mile from my house, pretty close
to that same Circle K, when it quits and won't restart.  I call home and ask
my wife to please bring me my spares and she does.  Slap on a new cap and
rotor, no change?!?  Something is definitely wrong here!  I give it one last
try and it starts but I only make it about 1/2 a mile before it quits again.
Ok, time to call the tow truck again...

The tow truck guy arrives, asks what's wrong, I say I'm not sure, probably a
bad condenser.  &quot;I used to have one of these, let me take a look at it.&quot;
This is when I should of said.  &quot;Please just tow me home&quot;  but I was foolish
and decided to see what he would say.  He takes a look and decided that the
ends of the plug wires are dirty and opens up his backpack of tools, first
pulling out a collection of porn magazines.  &quot;Yeah, just got those back from
my friend.  Go ahead, take a look while I fix your Bus.&quot;  I thought about it
for a second. &quot;Uh, that's ok, I'd rather see what you're doing.&quot;  He seemed
offended.  He proceeded to polish up the plug wires and the plug wire
connection to the coil.  I tried to crank it but no go.  He look at the
carb. a little.  &quot;The joints are all stiff, let me get something.&quot;  I don't
see how that could affect whether it starts or not but I give him some
leeway.  He returns from his truck with a spray can of lithium grease and
proceeds to cover the carb with it, along with the fan shroud and choke and
accelerator cable and the top of the engine.  I grimace in pain.  &quot;Here, you
can keep this. Try it again.&quot; he says.  &quot;Ok,&quot; I reply. Still no go.  He
looks at it again, &quot;Hey, looks like your intake manifold gasket is leaking
gas.&quot;  &quot;Damn, I just rebuilt the carb. and put the old one back on there.
That was stupid...&quot;  He continued &quot;Ok, let's tow it.&quot;

I dig into it the next day after work, pulling the carb. and attempting to
clean up all the grease he sprayed everywhere.  Also had to bend the
accelerator cable straight, he had twisted it somehow.   Replaced the intake
seal and condenser.  Put my other 28 PICT carb. into the dunk tank of carb.
cleaner for a real good soak and end up leaving it in there for 5 days.
(Woops!)  Then I notice the coil power wire is completely loose!  I know it
was on there when I was trying it so the tow truck guy must have broken it
when he was polishing up the coil.  Crimp on a new connector, engine fires
right up.  Let it idle for a while, shut it off, and it won't start again!
I'm getting 6-volts from the condenser connection on the coil, carb. has
gotta be ok, wait, how come I'm not getting a spark?  Check the voltage at
the power wire to the coil, 2-volts?  What the hell?  I go up to the fuse
box, yeah, getting 6-volts here, what's going on?  Mess with the connection
at the coil a little, all of a sudden, 6-volts!  Bad connection?  I clean up
the connection, everything fixed.

Decide to clean up the engine a little and am underneath the Bus when I
notice the single-tip of the exhaust looks a little crooked.  Hey, it's
cracked!  That stupid cop must have pushed my Bus with the exhaust tip!
Crap!

I consider asking the police to weld up the exhaust, even get as far as
calling the Highway Patrol offices to ask them if I can come by and have
their shop weld it up.  Then I decide that I'd rather have the exhaust and a
few other things welded simultaneously.  A fellow listee, Scott, puts me in
contact with a local guy available for some after-work welding duties and I
head over there Thursday night.  A quick weld of the exhaust and a small
hole in one of the stale-air J-tubes (I had it temporarily sealed with
exhaust tape) and it's ready to go.  He them moves on to welding up the
driver's side rear telescoping shock mount, which is a dealer-available(?)
addition that is detachable from my Bus.  It's previously been welded and he
informs me that they &quot;Brazed&quot; it (brass welding), which he explains is a
joke when it comes to suspension pieces.  He then proceeds to do a very
detailed job of welding and grinding to get all the brass out of the joint.
Hope it holds up this time...  Finally, I ask him to weld my driver's front
pop-out bracket back on (those always break, man).  I'm watching him weld it
up when all of a sudden he yells &quot;Sh*t!&quot; and jumps out the cargo area and
runs around to the driver's door.  Some sparks had gotten behind the front
seat and my rags are on fire!   He almost grabbed my handy fire extinguisher
but decided to just shoo them out real quick and onto the ground.  The top
of the back of the seat got a little melted (upholstery is crap anyway) but
other than that, no real damage.  He finishes up and we're talking about
middle seat repair when all-of-sudden another guy that is there says &quot;What's
all that smoke?&quot;  We look over and there's a huge cloud of smoke coming from
the other side of my Bus.  We all run over but luckily it's just the rags,
which have completely burned up by this time.  They get doused by beer.  I
pay the man and leave.

Results?  Nice interior, engine back in top operating condition, and a good
story as always...

Later,
