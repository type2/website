I never paid any attention to what it cost but without assembly I have
$2595.00 dollars rapped up in just parts alone (this has been over a long
time period though), and that's not counting heater boxes, push rod tubes,
gasket set, oil pump and cooler, or any external parts. So by the time I
finish this engine I will have $4000.00 give or take a couple hundred
dollars, ouch! and that's not counting my labor!!, but how sweet it should
be, coupled to the new trans I just had Rancho build for me, off I go again.
Still on the quest for the ultimate bus set-up. No flames VN, but I like to
cruise and if VW was still doing this who knows where they would have been
by now with progressive engine refinements.

Ronnie,  cruising in comfort

Ronnie,
I only have one question, and I'm not being a wise guy when I ask, what
could someone expect to spend to build the engine you are describing?
thanks
John

&gt; An 1800 is really a fairly common engine size. These are excellent for
&gt; buses.
 See it at Red Barn, KP and ask questions if you wish.

&gt; Ronnie,
&gt;
&gt; An 1800 is somewhat of an odd size engine, but it is exactly what I have
&gt; been wanting to build for my bus, bigger than stock, but still mild enough
&gt; for bus work.  What were you leaning towards as far as
&gt; cam/heads/carbs/exhaust?  Just curious....
