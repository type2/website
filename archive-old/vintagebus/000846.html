Hello Everyone,
		Just thought I'd bring everyone up to speed on my 66' Kombi Project (Yes
it is a Kombi).

  I just purchased a 66'/67' westfalia interior, fairly complete:

1. Icebox
2. folddown bed
3. closet
4. upper storage
5. folding tables(1 on the wall, 1 on the door, 1 on the icebox)
6. spice rack
7. It also came with the seat opposite the bed, but is missing the seat
between the icebox &amp; the seat(Jumpseat??)

All in very clean condition w/ no scratches.  I paid What I feel to be a
little high, but maybe that is just what it goes for.  $1200.00

I should have Pics up by the end of the week on my site, which is really the
reason I'm posting.  I'm planning a cross country trip in the spring of
2000, and I built this site as sort of a planner and a place to accumulate
info for my trip.  I know alot of you don't visit every site thats posted, I
don't either, but if you have the time check it out.  Not toooo flashy but
it serves it's purpose.

Check back often, as I still have a bunch of progress pics to scan.......

Thanks Again,


Kevin Albrecht
