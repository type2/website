I understand Jon.  If you really don't want to take it apart, that's
cool.  Try an auto electric rebuilder nearby and see what they'd want to
do the job.  Sounds like you can already remove it and strip the
peripherals off so you can hand them an alternator without all the extra
stuff hanging off it.  That'd probably be the cheapest way out for you.
Good luck &amp; let me know how you make out!
Dave
