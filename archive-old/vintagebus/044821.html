 I have seen them on either the left or right of the ashtray.  If you
 really don't want to drill holes, use the stock inspection lamp socket
 holes - look up at the bottom side of the parcel shelf on either side
 of the defroster duct.  Only trouble is that these are sized for the
 European accessory/lighter socket.  I guess you could get a Euro
 socket, install it, and make an adapter cord from a Euro plug and a
 US socket. &gt;&gt;

I heard these same plugs are used on BMW motorcycles.  There seems to be a 
large crossover between BMW bike folks and VW folks, and I believe youcan get 
the sockets for these (and accessories to plug in?) at a place that sells BMW 
motorcycles.
