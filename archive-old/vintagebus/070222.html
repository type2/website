Jerry-
Don't hold your breath on your mystery code. There are quite a few mystery
codes that we may never know. My '62 Kombi Swivel Seat has m374 as does
Johnny J's '59 Kombi Swivel Seat. Mine has a factory installed passanger
seat. His has no passanger seat but both full rear seats w/ m codes for
them. We have tried to figure the code out to no avail. The worrld may never
know.
