Hey everyone!

I thought I'd chime in for a bit just to say that I think this List is
great!  It's populated by a wonderfully diverse pantheon of VW nuts, or Type
2 nuts, and the range from green newbie who has just summoned the courage to
learn how to handle a wrench, to the amazing prowess of those who have the
parts numbers memorized and can rebuild an entire barndoor blindfolded, the
mad modmen, the &quot;I've GOT to have this here correct bolt to complete my
resto&quot; people, and everybody in between.

It's this diversity that makes for a strong, thriving community, and the
squabbles and bickering are one of the things that maintain the List's
character as a whole.

I feel grateful for the support and for the inspiration.

I also love living the life!  Ya gotta drive 'em!

Later
