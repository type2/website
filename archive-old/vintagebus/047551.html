GLEN WROTE:

Unfortunately, the 30 PICT 2 is leaking from the throttle shaft bushing on
the side of the accelerator pump. Dried it up and took it off.

So, the second question is, should I keep looking for a 30 PICT 1 or try and
have the 30 PICT 2 reconditioned?

you could inquire to see if someone ocally can rebush a carb for you.   Is it 
difficult to find old VW carbs there?


This now leaves me with the problem of the 1200 s PICT 28  acting up. Well,
I stripped it down and found small traces of soot/dust/crap behind the pilot
jet.
Looking through the recent archives this seems a little different then other
set ups. I should add that while I ve usually found the engine runs well,
and cool, last week I noticed one plug was ash covered. I now believe that
this might have been due to the dirty in the carb I ve just described, but
would this affect only one plug?

if it is just one plug, it would be very unlikely to be the carberator.  I 
would make sure the spark plug wires are all good, and do a compression check.

what doe sthe bently book say re jetting a 28 for a 40hp motor?
