Hi Volks,

I just made up some new words for the Lionel Ritchie song
&quot;All Night Long&quot;.  Enjoy...


All Night Long

well my friends the time has come
to board the Bus and have some fun
the tank is full, the oil change done
let your Westy roll on

on the highway keep it to the right
on the left lane watch them fight
they go by, Astra, Corrado, Fiesta --
forever putt on and sing along
they rush by, Astra, Corrado, Fiesta --
forever putt on and sing a song

all night long (all night) ...

people dying on the streets
they race their cars, deadlines to meet
high on sweat and adrenaline
let the morons race on

take it slowly, we have got the time
we'll arrive just safe and fine
they go by, Astra, Corrado, Fiesta --
forever putt on and sing along
they rush by, Astra, Corrado, Fiesta --
forever putt on and sing my song

all night long (all night) ...

yeah, once you drive Buses you can't love cars
come and make friends from both near and far
everybody's fixing their Buses today
join the type two list, see how we play!

http type two dot com
yeah, that's where we are
you need help or want to chat
oh, it's all there
http type two dot com
yeah, that's where we are!

and we'll have a party
all night long (all night) ...


(Note: &quot;Astra&quot; is an Opel compact car, &quot;Corrado&quot; a VW
coupe, and &quot;Fiesta&quot; a Ford microcar.  I'm not sure if
they are sold in the US, hence this note.  Feel free
to substitute other model names when singing it at the
campfire at the next Bus meet.  Oh, and the British
ought to maybe exchange &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;... :-)

Have a good weekend!

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
