&gt; &lt;&lt;  I can't seem to find a manual for my 60. The Bentley manuals I see are
&gt;  for 63 and later.Where can I get the one I need?Thanks, shawn
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; you cant.  sorry.
&gt;
&gt; VW made Transporter workshops Manuals -first one published in 1953, then
&gt; updated versions in 1955 (for your non barndoor) 1959, and 1963.  (I suppose
&gt; they kept making new versions after that)   These were originally made for
&gt; internal use within the VW organisation.   And contain warning about letting
&gt; outsiders have them.   At least some were printed by Richard Borek KG,
&gt; Braunschweig  Hahn-Druckererei GmbH, Hannover.
&gt;
&gt; What people refer to as the Bentley, is a reprint of teh 1963 edition of the
&gt; transporter Workshop Manual.  It covers 63 through 67 buses.     Do get it,
&gt; it covers your front suspension, brakes, rear suspension, and quite a lot in
&gt; between.   If you want the 1959 edition, search swap meets and look for them,
&gt; you can sometimes find an original copy.  But I dont think they were
&gt; published by Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; I think it is wonderful that VW and Bentley have responded to the rise in
&gt; popularity of the splitties by reprinting the 63 version.   It really is the
&gt; best easily availble manual you can get.

You can try it with a german version of a repair manual.
The original is from 1959 and you can obtain a copy from this manual for
example
from:
http://www.vw-axel-stauber_dot_com/
It is as detailed as the Bentley is. BUT it is in DEUTSCH. The manual
has around
450 pages and costs 99,- DM.
Just try it ; - )
