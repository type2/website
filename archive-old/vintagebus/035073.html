Actually, you run into problems with the american stock glass fitting into 
the safari frames.
The american stock glass is a little bit thicker than the original german 
stuff and using both NOS and repop seals are a B^%$H.
Dont tell them its for windshield either!!!!!
They can refuse to cut them.

as far as getting one cut for approx. $30.....yes. As for my reference to
original glass, I was speaking generally. I see people looking for original
windshields and side pop-out glass all the time. I was just making the
point that you can easily get a new piece cut. But, as you know, lots of
people want ALL original. I was just giving my point of view on the subject.
