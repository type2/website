Subject: Re:Paintin' me bus 

 Way to go jdd!
  I've taught myself how to paint also and man i could feel your pain on
having to redo things!  My first was a baja bug, what a mess!  I resanded it
right back down, repainted and it looked great!  My '61 Westy is my fourth
vehicule and my first with urethane and new hvlp gun.  It took a little
re-learning but it came out good!
  This is the reason i tell people to do it yourself, once you do it you can
paint as many vws you ever get!  Besides you'll have  many 'new' friends that
need a paint job!  Anyone with cash can get their bus painted by a &quot;pro&quot; and
then stand back and brag but you can say &quot;i did it myself&quot;, with pride!
  Well done,
    Lou in Havasu (see ya in Jerome!)
