Diana,
I'm sorry to hear about the accident.  

&lt;&lt;Anyway they'll probably decide my bus was worth about 
$100 either way.  &gt;&gt;
  
I don't know how insurance is run up in B.C. but here in Seattle when your
vehicle is deemed &quot;totaled&quot; you can get collector value for your bus if it
was in decent shape. Most unrestored busses are valued at around
$2,000-$6,000.  When my bus got in a fender bender I had it officially
appraised by a few VW big-wigs in the area at $4,700.  When the insurance
company decided to only give me $600 bucks for the damages I whipped out the
appraisals and showed them different.  Needless to say I got almost $2,000
for the damage done to my &quot;collector vehicle&quot;.  It took a while but I fought
for the proper repair value.  Depending on the overall appearance and
condition of your bus before the accident and also which type of bus it was,
i.e.. panel, kombi, deluxe, It's worth will vary.  If it is deemed &quot;totaled&quot;
you can get your money and buy back your bus for $100-$200 as salvage.  Then
use it as a parts vehicle or fix it up as some of my friends have done.
Use any and all of your receipts from parts you bought for the bus to
reinforce it's current value.  If you can prove it is a collector vehicle
and you have documented proof you were in the process of restoring the
vehicle it helps with the insurance appraisal.  Busses don't have a high
value in the mind of an insurance adjuster, so you have to convince them of
it's worth and educate them on their collectability.

I hope you are feeling better. :-)
Good luck with the bus.
