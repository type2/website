I am an advocate of rebuilding your own carbs.  You get the same carb that you know fits... Or has already been bent/grinded/cursed into fitting nicely before so fix it and put it back.  For roughly $11 you can buy a rebuild kit and for $10 more buy a gallon of carb cleaner that will last a very long time (it is toxic waste so it should have a half-life of 2000 years).  Follow your Bentley manual and some common sence (pay attention when you take it appart and do not heavy hand it) and you should be home free.  Bob Hoover used to have a great article on the initial settings to work from if you have his CD-ROM (which I do not... yet).  But the rebuild kit will have some basic instructions also that will get it done.

I dreaded my first rebuild and now I almost want to go out and find carbs to rebuild!  Sick mind I guess.  I have done a few 32s, a 34, and two baby Webers(very easy!).

Best of luck and think of it as recycling :)
