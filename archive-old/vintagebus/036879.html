    The rainy season has hit the PNW so I'm not doin' much work on the bus
but I'm tryin' to build up some capitol to put into it.  I know for a fact
that I need to get my frame blasted, top priority, asap. All the rest of
the body ok for my standards. Being that it has a sunroof and has belly
pans(already on) I was wondering what my options were to get it blasted?
Basically, the guy I'd go to is about 8 miles away in the next town over.
I know the pans are there for a purpose, I was wondering what effect
it would have if I could cut them out(so we can blast the frame and
whatnot) and then driver over, get the job done, and come back, por15(or
other neat options) and then toss'em back on? Would it
buckle? It is to big of a risk?  Any other ideas?    
thanks much!!

Are your belley pans good, are do they have rust eating them away?     I
haven't heard many people feeling they need the frame blasted- I suppose you
want to do undercoating or repaint it there or something.   We don't have salt
in the PNW, so frame rust is notthe problem it is in some climates.   You may
find it a PITA to weld them back on, especially upside down.

    I guess I don't see where your rust is- usually things rust front the
inside out here, from leaky windows.   Could you descibe the rust a bit more?

Driving around w/o belley pans is not a good idea, but for a short distance it
probably wouldn't harm anything, as long as you aren't offroading.
