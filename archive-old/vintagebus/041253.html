&gt; Fuel pump question for any still here.
&gt; Copper line coming into pump fitting is loose, but
&gt; is not leaking while sitting there.  It turns and wiggles
&gt; at the pump.  I would think it shouldn't be loose at all.  

Perfect recipe for a bus fire! REPLACE PUMP!!! I wouldn't bother with 
trying to secure it onto the fuel pump body.
