Hey list...whats up! My name is Christian and I am currently (after six 
years of sitting in the driveway) resto'in my 63 panel, Else. I have been 
following various conversations on the list and can tell that you are my 
kind of people and am really looking forward to some good chats with the lot 
of ya. I just finished the engine compartment and the rear floor pan (I'll 
try to get some pictures out there for you guys to look at and tell me what 
you think) and when you strip the shit off the bottom of your bus thats 
built up over almost forty years...I am a humble man. Painted and done with 
I am going to start on the mid section floor pan today and hopefully will 
have that done and sealed by friday when her trans. comes home from the 
shop!!!(the reason I have never even driven the thing is the dude that had 
it before me dropped the clutch and sheered the axel from the diff....what a 
mess) But so this does not turn into a babbling stumbling e-mail...I'll talk 
to ya soon guys! Right on for getting the  info out there and flowing!!!

   -Christian Hedberg
