Hey Now

  I just read the report that Robert Davis gave on the 60 westy with all
the cool missing parts!!  Sounds like the Westy for me!  Anywho.  Are
all the people who own and operate busses on this very list?(I'm joking of
course) My question is are we(this consortium, even if you lerk or post)
doing this price gorging to ourself?  A price is a price:
lazy-fair(ha-ha), pay for what you get,
whatever it can go for, the market, etc etc etc.  Maybe it's just me, but
since we've been talking about all these HUGE HUGE prices(which we've been
talkin' about for quite a while..the thread runs on for about a couple
years) the price has gone up and up.  Did we generate this and are we
making it last?  What were the signs of the other car markets(356's, I
think it was people were talkin' about prior) going down?  Can we drive
this market down?  Is this just a wait and see kinda deal?  I'm sure the
history will tell.  It strikes me as being completely amazing that folks
in the 80's had a hard time just giving away a deluxe!(if from what I hear
is true).  Ah, I'm just hopelessly envious.  =)

p.s. I saw on TV a couple months ago a strange show.  It was a concert
around 1970ish..on the shores of Cali.  The players were Crosby Stills
Nash and Young(with Stills getting in a fight!), Joni Michell, and some
soul group, etc.  The busses on this show! OH MY! There must have been a
least 60 different bus.  All years, all models.  It was the coolest thing,
but something was horribly bad: even by 1970 most of the busses that I saw
were in a total state of disaray.  It was sad...  For the busses that are
now 40 years old + or -, it's a miracle that they are even found with some
orginality left.  Here's to that old barnyard find! Oh, what was that show
called?  It was on the ocean... great gig!
