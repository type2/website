Rats.  I thought I magically cured the play.  ;-)

So this brings up two more questions.  First, my 3/4&quot; breaker bar and big
_at_$$ socket are a bit over 100 miles S of me.  Is it going to hurt anything
to drive it back?  I have the cast-iron hammer-type nut remover up here, but
I would rather not use it if I can avoid it due to the possibility of
damaging the bearings.  I've put over 150 on it as it sits with the extra
o-ring.  I'm worried I have too much pressure on the bearing(?).

Second, on my spacer ring, there _was_ an o-ring on removal.  I couldn't
find a clear illustration or picture of it in the Bentley...the ring kinda
looks like half a clutch T/O bearing to me.  I guess I'd have to go to a
bearing supply to get an o-ring for it?  If it'd help, I can take a pic of
it when I pull it apart this weekend.

Thanks, I had no idea about the Type 3 o-ring...I tell ya, it fits right in
there :-)

&gt; Take it back apart and remove the large O-ring.  That part is for type 3.
&gt; There is only supposed to be a Oring that just fits onto the lower axle.
