Subject: Got Glasurit Mouse Gray L325 / Pearl White L87 codes
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Split List, 

I have been working with Glasurit to mix up some Mouse Gray L325 (61-1/2 
through 63 passenger busses).  It has been a struggle, as this is not a very 
popular color, and was never reformulated for the current product lines.  I 
have actually never seen another mouse gray bus (VT not CA).  Anyway, I 
finally got the paint in Glasurit 22 line (single stage solid).  Here is the 
Glasurit code:

Grau SK 9713 61-01 VW CL547921

Apparently, they can mix the color if you just give them this code.  

I also got some Pearl White L-87 in the same line.  This is, of course, a 
popular color and had been reformulated for 22 line.  Here is the code:

Pearlweiss 58-70 VW WH1849

If anyone else has recently got some Glasurit pearl white, how does this code 
compare?  I am using 22 line for the more antique/original look that 
base/clear coat just doesn't have.  The code may be different in other lines. 
 Glasurit's base/clear line is 55.  There is also a 90 low-VOC.

What Glasurit lines are others using?

Man, is this paint EXPENSIVE!  A quart of color with enough reducer and 
hardener cost me $140.  ouch.  Looks pretty nasty from the MSDS too, 
isocyanate and everything.  22 line is billed as urethane acrylic.  

I have not shot any yet, but will let you know how a test area comes out when 
I do.
