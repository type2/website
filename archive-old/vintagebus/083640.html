So I  find myself with a lot of 20W-50 oil.

What's everyones opinion on  running this weight oil?


Hi Roger,
Use it for the air cleaner only then!  Multiwieght oil breaks down in  hot VW 
engine into the lower wieght listed.  So we use 10/30 Wt during  cool/cold 
seasons here and when temps are going to be staying well above 50F we  change 
over to 30 Wt..  We did try 20/50 Castrol and found the oil pressure  in cool 
weather was so high at start up that the oil cooler was at risk of  swelling or 
even blowing up.
