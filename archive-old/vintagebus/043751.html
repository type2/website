Subject: Three O's on engine case
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10107012112010.9046-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

All,

Someone was asking about an engine number that started with three O's.
While looking for something else I found this note in Bentley:

&quot;Engines in which oversize crankshaft bearings have been installed,
should be marked with an &quot;O&quot; below the engine number.&quot; (p. M-9.10)

So, maybe the three Os indicate it has been bored to three oversizes.
Just a thought.
