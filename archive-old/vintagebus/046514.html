Hello everyone,
     I remember seeing a post about someone that had replacement light
filters for the lamps on the speedometer but I can't find any reference to
it in the archives.  Does anyone have any information about where to get
replacement filters?  (I am talking about the little filters that make the
idiot lights red and green, and the high beam light show blue, and the turn
signal lights show yellow)

Also, I am looking for a good condition '67 fuel gauge.  If anyone out there
has one for sale, please let me know.

you can unscrew the back of the speedo, and stick new pieces of coloured 
plastic into the speedo, and screw it back together.    I dont know where to 
get the plastc, I had some from someone who did lights for bands.
