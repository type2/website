I had this same problemhen when I put my doors together.  I took a shim 
(like a u-shaped spacer) and put it under the bottem hinge.  It tilted the 
whole door to what I needed.  You can also move the door up and down and 
tighten the screws where you want them...not much adjustment room, but it 
should give you what you need.  I've also heard of people &quot;twisting&quot; the 
door?  I think you mentioned this...like lifting on it while it is open.  
Not recommended while on jacks!  ;)

As for the chipped paint...I chipped a small piece off my parking brake 
lever and swore at myself.  Then, I went to the shop and got some leftover 
paint to touch it up with, and made it look nice again.  Usually takes a few 
coats.  As for exterior paint, it's a bit difficult to make that look 
perfect again.  My suggestion is to just work slowly and not force anything.
Hope some of this helps ya out.
