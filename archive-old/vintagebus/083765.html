&gt; You didn't say what the issue was, so that makes it kind of hard to

your right John, I really didn't spell out the issue (whoops). but
your guess is spot on. There was nearly nothing left of the gaskets
between the manifold and head. Just enough to keep the manifold tight,
(read material at the studs) but nothing in the middle where I really
needed it to seal. I have had this issue for at least a few months,
and noticed the strange problem on my trip out west. Guess I should
have just emailed the list before I got around to doing the dirty work
myself ;) Kuddos John!
