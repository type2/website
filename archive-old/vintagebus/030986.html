&gt;
&gt; Recently, I bought a '60 (built sept. '59)DC with a set
&gt; of PRISTINE yellow with black lettered CA plates.
&gt; Yesterday, I received new plates that are 7 digits of
&gt; reflective ugly in the mail. I go to the DMV (insert
&gt; rant about lines, rudness, etc here) to fill out
&gt; a &quot;statement of facts&quot; of how I didn't want them, I
&gt; didn't request them, that I have both old ones in good
&gt; shape and please Mr. bureaucrat can I keep the old
&gt; ones?? Hopefully I won't get some by-the-book bean
&gt; counter who will deny my request!

This has been done by myself and many others.  I think Thom gave a very
accurate response on what you need to do last year or so.  Check the
archives (if that is still possible) or maybe Thom will chime in.  I
intentionally erased the entire hellish nightmare from my memory.  Ahh that
feels better.
BTW make sure the plates you have are commercial.  6 digits instead of the
car version 5.
