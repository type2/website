Subject: cleaning your air cleaner
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id IAA21560

I am hoping to clean my air cleaner, as i don't think it has ever been
cleaned...according to the library I guess i just dip the whole thing in a
bucket of kerosene, then try some tsp and hot water a few times...then back in
kerosene again...then let it dry out and hook it back up.

am i missing anything?
