Subject: Yokohama Y356 185R14 - C or D ?

Many thanks to all those who replied via the list or by pmail about
tires.  It comes down to this:

National Tire and Battery (NTB) has the Y356 in 185R14 for $59.99 ea.,
in either a C or D load range.  The tires are a special order item, but
they say that they can have them in in less than a week.  They insist
that they have the proper adapter to balance the wheels.

Hey advise that the C load range is a six ply tire rated for 1600 pounds
at 50 psi, and that the D range is an 8 ply rated at 1850 pounds at 65
psi.

My understanding is that 1540 pounds per tire is the magic number, so do
I get the C load range and have a better ride than with the D?  Or would
there be no difference in the ride, so for the same money I should get
the higher rating?

Thanks for your pertinence and input.
