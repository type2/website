Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Gear Ratio's

I thought the stock bus (and ghia) 4th was a .82, and the .89 is the bug 4th. 
 There are other stock combos than what you said, of course.

FWIW my 65 w/ 1.26rgb, 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th gets 3K at 58mph, 3500rpms at 68 
mph, which is pdc to what you wrote.  195 75 14s

funny thing is the 61 with 4.38, 1.26 and 205 75 15s has the same 58mph at 
3K, and pulls hills better (okay, the westy is heavier).    People have said the 
math does not work out to that speed/rpms several times, and you are 
cordially invited to come check it out, bring your own tach and GPS if you like.    I 
was shocked when I pulled the ring gear off and counted teeth (when the tranny 
went bad a few years ago) That early 64 gearing kicks booty.

didn't they change the gearing in the bays when they went to the 2litre 
motor?   ie a 77 is higher geared than a 73  

but I have no clue about what tires to use with an IRS or RGB free bus.  I'd 
swap it back , but that's my OPBO
