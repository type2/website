Subject: Monster Garage comes to Havasu

  I will be leaving in a few minutes to go watch the Discovery channel film
an episode of Monster Garage here in Lake Havasu. They have converted a bus
to float and drive like a boat ( a school bus not one of beloved VW buses).
I am going to try and get one of my buses in some backround shots, we'll see
what happens.
