For those of you looking for washer bottle tops, contact Das Bulli
Haus.  Yes...the sheet metal guy/girl.  I ordered some metal and a repop
washer bottle top last May.  I'm not sure if they still have them or are
still importing them along with the panels.  They are not perfect repos,
the basic shape is the same though, and they should be perfectly
functionable (I'm a long way from testing mine out), but details like
the VW logo and part # are missing.  The fit and finish need improvement
also.  $14.00 each.  Fairly pricy, but better than a turkey baster!
