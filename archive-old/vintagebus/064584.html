Subject: Re: [VB] gear oil

I first made inquiry of the various oil companies (in USA only) easily found
on the web and asked if they had a GL-4 gear oil and what happens if API
GL-5 gear oil is used in an API GL-4 gear oil application.  The consistent
and typical answer was, &quot;...if an API GL-5 gear oil is used in an
application where API GL-4 gear oil is called for, chemical corrosion of
&quot;yellow metal&quot; components may occur, such as bronze synchronizers, brass
bushings, etc. This may lead to shifting difficulties or shortened life.
&quot;[Pennzoil web site] &quot;Typically, GL-5 gear oil will have about 2 times the
active additive level of a GL-4 Product.  This additional additive can cause
problems with yellow metals such as brass or bronze. &quot;[Castrol tech email]

 The only oil companies I contacted which said they had a GL-4 product were
Pennzoil, Castrol &amp; Valvoline. Details follow:
  a.. Pennzoil Gear Plus  GL-4  SAE 80W-90  stock # 21176   32 oz bottle

  b.. Castrol  Hypoy Gear Oil  GL-4 SAE  80W-90  35  lb pail(5 gal)

  c.. Valvoline Hydro-Lube Gear Oil GL-3 &amp; 4  SAE 80W-90   part #  538   5
gal por-pail

I also found the following product in one of the local chain auto parts
stores (Trak Auto and NAPA):

  a.. Sta-Lube Hypoid Gear Oil GL-4 SAE 85W-90 part #SL24229 32 oz bottle
(div of CRC Industries, Inc)

At this time these are the product possibilities I know of in the US  if one
wants to use API GL-4 in their GBX/OD.  I bought 3 quarts of the Sta-Lube
brand for about $ 3.00 ea. (all that was on hand).  TRF sells Castrol Hypoy
(cat #TRFGL4) repackaged in quart (32 oz) bottles for $ 5.50 ea + shipping..

  StaLub (div of CRC Industries, Inc. [tech svc 800 521 3168, cust svc 800
272 8963, tel nos not verified]) supplies a fine and inexpensive dispensing
pump (product #SL4344) which makes adding gear oil  reasonably easy.  I have
one of these pumps and like it a lot - although I hope to seldom make use of
it in future.

&gt; &gt;If the Mobile synthetic GL5 uses phosphorus and sulfur compounds to get
&gt; &gt;the GL5 rating, then it will be just as bad for your synchronizers as
&gt; &gt;regular GL5. GL numbers have to do with the pressure rating of the oil.
&gt; &gt;Redline makes a synthetic GL4. Look for MT-90 under the products pull
&gt; &gt;down.
