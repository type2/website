Good morning list,

Some of you may remember the saga of the South African double cab and
its moron driver(me). For those that don't I'll give you a short
history.

Bought the van about 5 years ago from the second owner who bought it
&gt;from the first guy in the early seventies. It was fairly sound but for
rusty sills and missing loadbay gates. I replaced the 1300 TP with a
crappy rebuilt 1600TP and drove it maintenance free (almost) for 2
years.

My employment situation steadily improved and a succession of company
cars resulted. During this period(about 3 years) the van was given
little attention and was infrequently driven.

Late last year I decided I wanted to get out of sales and into the
systems development field. This necessitated a drastic drop in salary as
I had no prior experience in the field. It also meant giving up the
company car(company cars are the best cars!!!!!!!!!).

I then decided to sort my van out so as to get back to being a two car
family. Began strip down process and found more serious body cancer than
I had expected or was able to deal with. Decided to send the stripped
body in to some local beetle restorers. Got a mind blowing quote from
them but decided to go with it as the quality of their beetles was good.

Needless to say the result was not as I had expected and many niggles
remain. It also took them two tries and 6 weeks longer than it quoted.

I have been working until 2 or 3am every night to get it all back
together in time for our holiday at the end of may. I am on track after
many apparently insurmountable obstacles.

I took the van for a short drive yesterday(not insured yet) and it went
great. It has a late mexican case and is balanced from pressure plate to
pulley wheel. Can't believe how smooth a beetle engine can be!!!! I am
running it in very carefully so have been light footed but can still
feel that it is a hell of a lot more perky than that which it replaced.

I am almost done, the stuff that remains to be done is all cosmetic so
my holiday transport is secure. Thanks to those list members who have
helped me with advice and a special thank you to Thom for the wiring
diagrams on his site.

The PO fancied himself a bit of an auto electrician and had made some
pretty creative mods to the vans nervous system. I found that he had
bridged most of the wires into the engine bay after the ignition wire
had shorted and cooked a bit of the harness. Didn't occur to the silly
bugger to remove the old wires so there were a lot to choose from when
it came to reassembly of the back.
