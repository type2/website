I had asked a while back about people camping out and have since had 
several computer crashes and I have lost the info.  I was interested 
in finding out where the Box On Wheels camp out was.  Could someone 
please send me the info again?  Also, is there anyone taking hwy 101 
down to LA on friday afternoon / evening and want to convoy?
