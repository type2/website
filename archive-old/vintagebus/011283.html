&lt;&lt; Does anyone (E+B perhaps) have any pre and post Type IV oil cooler
 conversion oil temp figures. &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Unfotunitly not yet by comparing exact engines to each other.  We have 
noticed a big temperature/pressure differance between the big bore 40 HP 
engines with dog house we used to run, and the 1641cc SP with type 4 cooler, 
dual relief case engine we are running now.  The big bore 40 HP with dog 
house ran alot hotter even though the engine was of a smaller size while 
running at the same RPMs/MPH, and simular hot weather on trips we did, and 
now do with the 1641.   Eric&amp;Barb
