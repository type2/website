Could be shocks, tranny mounts (front or back), loose engine bolts
(although I'd expect some trouble shifting, since that would make the
clutch not fully disengage), or a dying torsion bar.  The shocks would
be most suspect if it only happened when hitting bumps, unless you're
really getting the engine revved *way* up before dumping the clutch.

So, I'd check the engine bolts and the tranny mounts.  Of course,
tranny mounts can fail in such a way that you can't see the
failure...trying lifting the tranny a bit with a floor jack (don't
lift the entire vehicle, the idea is to see if the mounts give any,
not rip them apart so you *have* to replace them).  The tranny has
three mount points - two next the engine, and one up front.
