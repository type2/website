Subject: New Mexi engine with 034 dizzy

 I just finished installing a new Mexi engine in a 67 beetle. Usual stuff, new muffler, dog house, 34 pict 3 and the thing 
that really made it work was the installation of a NEW 034 vac advance dizzy. Day and night difference over using an 
009 and with the price of 009's going out the roof the vac advance 034 is the only way to go. No hesitation, no over 
jetting to compensate for the lag, yadaa, yadda yadda. Just ordered 5 more to do conversations on the rest of my 
runners.
  Can wait to get my vac adapted Kadron base plate back from Low Budget Racing to put on the 1800 which is going 
into my newly to be lowered DD panel till the 1904 or 1885 are finished for it!
