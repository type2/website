Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor question

You might try cleaning your connections as well; both at the switch and at he motor.

Sean,

 

Thats a good question.  Well, they sweep all the way from one side of the windshield to the other, so if I reposition them, theyd go over one side or the other.    Usually (but not all the time), the motor parks the wiper near the center of its right to left motion.

 

Ill have to take a close look this weekend, and make sure that none of the mechanics attached to the motor are bent.

 

Thanks,

Russell

Are your wiper arms on correctly?

For the two-speed, self-parking wiper motor, what is the mechanism that
causes the motor to self park? My 67 just failed state inspection
because the motor parks the wiper in the middle of the windshield. This
hadn't been a problem to me, because I had found that if I turn off the
switch at just the right time, the wiper will park to the side, but the
state inspector didn't know the trick, so my bus has a nice black reject
sticker until I can fix it.

Just in time for a weekend project 8^)

Thanks for suggestions,
Russell
