Subject: welding with a MIG
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 2000 17:55:00 -0500

I own a 110v Century Flux Core Mig Welding machine.  My question is this.
Has anyone ever welded with BOTH a fluxcore machine, and a gas (ARGON) MIG
welder? I can't seem to make anything but popcorn welds with my flux core
machine, and am thinking about buying a real 220v Gas Mig welder.  Is there
that big of a difference in the flux core, and the gas? Or is it just my
welding skills?

Any input would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks
Charles
