 Why ?  I have a '62 and was very interested in this thread since safaris are 
 on my list.
 &gt;&gt;
 
 Its been discussed before, but post-62 busses a have a recessed area where 
 the hinges mount.
 Thom and I both had problems installing the C.E. safaris because they were 
 engineered for busses with this recessed area.
 Word of advice for anyone wanting safaris.....
 BUY ORIGINALS OR STICK WITH FIXED WINDSHIELDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
  &gt;&gt;
even if you get original, you might want to wear Wellie boots when you are 
driving you bus in the rain.
