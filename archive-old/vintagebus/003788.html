Most unfortunate about the 009. You can find a real distributor later,
though. Anyway, on startup of a new engine I like to pack the oil pump with
Vaseline. It gives a good quick prime and dissolves from the bearings almost
instantly on startup. Don't use grease, it will plug the push rods and
lifters and never allow oil through. Bad thing. Anyhoo, crank it with the
coil wire off until the oil light goes out. Plug the coil in and fire it up.
Crank the throttle on up to 2000 RPM's or so and hold it there for 5 or 10
minutes. This is to get the cam and lifters oiled. Don't even think about
touching the clutch pedal during this time or you will smoke your front
(FIF) main bearing and eat your shims. At this point I like to drop the oil.
We're using the cheapest oil we can lay out hands on, right? Yes we are,
cheap smelly dirty recycled grocery store brand oil. 59 cents a quart is
good. And we are going to refill it with it and drive for 500 miles then
drop it again. At this point you should be able to switch to a good oil. Use
of good oil for break-in means your rings may never seat, your bearings will
not work harden, your daughter will run off with a Navy troop ship, etc. Bad
mojo. I believe that you can break them in as you normally drive them,
provided you don't peg it at or above redline and go tooling down the
freeway for ten hours. Keep it under 3000 rpm's for awhile. Of course I also
think you should never exceed 4000 rpm's if you want it to last. Folks who
enjoy spinning out a lot of rod bearings will disagree. 8^)

&gt; does anyone know a good procedure to go
&gt; through with a brand new motor? to give you some info
&gt; on it: it's a 1600 DP, it has dual weber 34's, it has
&gt; the later-style fanshroud and oil cooler, a empi
&gt; GT-style muffler, a generator, bosch 009, and a blue
&gt; coil. i think that's all the main stuff.
