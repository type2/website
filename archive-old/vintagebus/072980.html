&gt; Yes, when you hear that rattlesnake noise, stop now.  Do not pass go.  Do not 
&gt; collect $200.  call tow truck.  

one of the things i appreciate most about clara's posts is the totally approachable, comprehensible way she describes things.  there's always something in her posts that i can use.  her sense of humor does not suck either.  &lt;grin&gt;  thank you clara!

cheers,
