 Welcome to the list.  The 5 word thing was hopefully a fun one-time thing and I have declared a truce with the hippy bus people so hopefully things should simmer down a bit.  It is overall a good fun, helpful group.  Glad to see that you are leaving the Chevy scene, by the way.

I joined this site about a week or 2 ago. I have already posted a
couple of questions here, and got some great responses back from some
very caring and giving individuals. People have gone out of their way
to help with my bus questions.

But unfortunately, it seems that most of the posts/talk on this site is
about truck drivers, whether you like or dislike hippies, and 5 word
contests. Is that really what this site was intended for?

This is such a tremendous resource for people needing help, learning
more about our busses, and especially for making new friends that share
a common interest. We all have such a great thing going here, it seems
a shame for someone like me, who is new to all of this, to have to wade
through all of the flaming and things that have absolutely nothing to do
with the purpose of this site, just to find out a little information.

Coming from a background in restoring Chevys, I can tell you for a fact
that VW people are a breed unto themselves. Chevy people, and maybe all
other car people, have absolutely no interest in helping their fellow
collectors, restorers, etc. They keep all of their sources for parts,
information, etc, a secret. With those cars, it's every man for
himself, and if you can't figure your problem out on your own, it's
just too bad.

On the other hand, I have been restoring vw's for about 4 years now,
(I'm a 60's guy, having bought my first new vw in 1964, and have owned
over 30 since then) I'm here to tell you that I have never met a bunch
of people that are more interested in helping out others who simply
share the same interest. I've met so many wonderful people with vw's,
who are genuinly concerned with helping others.

It's with that thought in mind that I am ready to push the send button
on this email. I wish people would stop and think about what they're
posting on this site before they do it. I'll probably get flamed by
someone for this as well. If that happens though, maybe the person
doing the flaming would be interested in buying my '65 Chevelle?
