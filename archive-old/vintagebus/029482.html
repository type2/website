Subject: Emergency flasher help needed

Hey list, can anyone help?

What is the best solution for the emergency flasher system on a 65 bus?
It is a ine year thing and i am not sure the best way to go about making
this work.

I have tried to install the kit that alot of the shop's use but i do not
think it will work.  this is the kit made by Wire works that replaces
the flasher system on everything but a bus.  (I have been told it can be
converted for a bus but how???)

Any tips out there on how to go about this?  I do not have the original
flasher unit.  Other wise everything else electrical is new.

Thanks
Matthew
