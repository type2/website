&gt; Well here's the thing - when I ran the bus again it run purrrrfectly  ?? 
&gt; and I'm still convinved that petrol was not the problem.  Anyhow I drove 
&gt; over to the parts shop and replace the leads, condensor (with a Nisson 
&gt; one!) and points and it's still sweet.
&gt; 
&gt; Who knows whether I cured it ...
&gt; 
&gt; I've still not fitted the inline filter becase I want an more 
&gt; substantial one than the $2 plastic thing.  Does anyone know if there is 
&gt; a nice modern period metal/glass one on the market ?

well congratulations on hopefully fixing the misfire problem!

about the plastic fuel filters:  i have never had a plastic one break, come loose or explode in more than 15 years of vw driving.  if you look at the vintage bus archives about the supposed danger of using plastic filters, you'll find a whole mess of folks with similar (non-)experiences.  consensus, as i remember, is that glass filters are a waste of money.

that said, it is your bus and you need to feel comfortable about driving it!
