There has to be a level of common sense; when something's wore out,
or ruined, accept it, and move on.

Trying to rehab a barndoor apron is a hassle, but I can't just
waltz out and buy a new one, so it makes sense.  But when an NOS one
comes along, I'm sure as hell gonna buy it, so I can spend the effort
on something else!
