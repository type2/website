.  I know that Westies and Sundials both used the
crank out windows.  The way to tell the diff between
a westy and a sundial is:  Westies have a window
behind the 2 cargo door windows, and the Sundial
doesn't.  The Sundials were made out of panel van,
and the windows were added by Sundial, whereas the
Westies were built from a standard bus.
***************************************
This is not always the case, I have a 67 Sundial with
the window behind the cargo doors and my Sundial was
converted from a 11 window bus not a panel.
