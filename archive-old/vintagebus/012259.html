&gt; some of them, but not all.  Hopefully someone can assist.
&gt; I.D. behind the seat:
&gt; 03    radio?       6   ??????

This is actually Production Date in European format (dd mm),
so the bus was built 3 June 1966.

&gt; 430  ????   B42 Std Westy w/roof rack, pop top and tent   J98 ????

&gt; 080 Walk thru Kombi, LHD only 108 ?????

These are actual M-Codes.  430 is USA Prep (bumper overriders,
laminated glass, red tail lights, etc.) tho not actually
confirmed from VWAG.  108 is part of the Westfalia package, exact
meaning unknown.  The J98 is a puzzler.  I have a computer file
of over 600 M-Codes, but this is the first J98 I've seen.  I know
of a C98, but no known explanation.  Can you confirm it's
actually J98?

&gt; UT  USA destined- port of entry????

UT was used for USA-bound vehicles picked up by owners at the
factory in Germany then shipped back by owners.

&gt; then for the last #s2312 523907 6163674

231 is Model number for Kombi.  All Westfalias started as Kombis then
the camper equipment went in.  2 is the type of paint.

5=special paint
23=model (Kombi)
907=Pearl White

6=1966 Model Year
163674 is sequentially the 163,674th for the 1966 model year.

&gt; It's a carb I've never seen before.

Can't help on the carb information.
