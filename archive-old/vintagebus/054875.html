Ok...I have to ask something here.

Where, and when, was this complaint addressed?? :)  My '66 so-44 has a
/popout/ window factory-installed in the closet.  My old so-67 '69 Had a
window in the closet, albeit covered.

My 75 deluxe westy did not, though..But its closet forced the spare onto
the nose.

Moms 82 Vanagon Deluxe Westy ALSO has a window in the closet, if memory
serves....at least, I recall many many vanagon owners complaining about
the closet being in the way of tinting that window...I dont use moms
closet, so my memory isnt fresh...even if I did put a transmission in it
sunday. :)

I also seem to recall all of the so-42 campers that I can think of /also/
having a window in the closet....

So, again, what is the issue that they addressed?  Was it a /lack/ of
window issue, so they added it??
