I agree...it seems to be a bit of jealousy. Add to that some xenophobia and
a little rampant racism and you have a pretty good picture. I think that
Japan-bashing brings down the image of our hobby. You'll get the argument
that &quot;they are taking these nice vintage VWs overseas&quot; which is, of course,
ridiculous as that's what we've been doing for years. I've heard of a lot
of sellers being hassled for selling to Japanese customers and that's
idiotic too. If I sell something (if you know me, you know I'm a hoarder,
not a seller) but I don't care where the money comes from. If it's for
sale, it's for sale. Unless I have a personal issue with the party
involved...I won't sell to you if you're an _at_ssh*le no matter what language
you speak! As Dennis Miller said (paraphrased) &quot;Why hate a whole group of
people you've never met...if you take the time to really get to know
someone you can always find a specific reason to hate them individually&quot;.

There are going to be some people that say it's typical for someone like me
to cry &quot;racism&quot; at this, but what else can it be? To judge someone by their
race...isn't that the same?

Oh well, there's some bad apples in every bunch. And hopefully the rest of
us can rise above their level and keep the image of our community on the up
and up.
