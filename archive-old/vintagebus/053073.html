Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

Try a dial type oil pressure guage.   I had started getting low oil pressure 
and light flickering in my 65 (motor now in 61) a couple years ago and it 
freaked me out as I was in Arizona.   Turned out the sender was bad- the 
reading on the non electric dial guage was way higher than the guage 
installed in bus.  Bought new sender, light stopped flickering at me.  It was 
dated 77- I had pulled that sender of a motor somewhere.  Just a thought.

What was the play in the oil pump when you installed it?  You put the feeler 
guage between the teetch of the gears in there and measured right?  the spec 
is i think .008 &quot;, new should be .004&quot;  might have the number wrong, it is in 
the bentley etc.

You dont actually have to drain oil to mess with oil pressure springs.   a 
bit will drip out when you pull the plug, but maybe 1/8 cup if that.

&lt;&lt;  wonder how many listees push delete when they see my address.
 
 Thanks for the replies. I tried to respond to each or to the list.
 
 Anyway,
 Today I put in a mechanical pressure gauge and at start up the pressure was
 50 psi. I put in the electric sender and mounted the gauge up front. The
 pressure on the gauge agreed at start up and took for a drive. By the time I
 got to about 200 degrees the pressure was more like 20 psi and at idle of
 around 900 rpm (a guess), down to 4-5 psi, and the light was flickering
 again.
 
 Flaps was sold out of new oil pressure springs until next week so for grins
 I shimmed them .120 inch and repeated the test drive. I put 40w oil in again
 as I did not want to change two things at once. Same sorry results. The oil
 pump is new and if it was faulty, would I have great startup pressures?
 
 When I rebuilt this puppy everything that could me micced was, and
 plastigauge used where it could be used. I had to trust the machine shop on
 # 3 main as was put on before I got it back from them.
 
 When this case was last running in the 71DP, it ran hot but I never had any
 &quot;oil light on&quot; indication of poor pressure.
 
 Other notes: The oil does not smell like gas.
 I think the vibrations may be a combination of factors as is not
 reproducible when the bus is not rolling. May have to get worse then be
 obvious??
 
 Any more thoughts?
