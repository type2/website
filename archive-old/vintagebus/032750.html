&lt;&lt; i have a 69 bus that has a doner engine + tranny if possible. i would like
 to take out the rear end of my 69 and put it into my 60. does anyone know if
 this is possible. any help is appriciated
  &gt;&gt;

the motor will switch fine, just remove the cross piece brace from it before 
putting it in the splitty.  If the 69 has a regular bus muffler, the 
taillpipe will hit the bumper of the bus, the splittys came with a pigtail 
tailpipe to avoid this.

the 1960 came with a swing axle trannys, where the tranny is attached to the 
axle tubes and there are reduction boxes  at each side.  The 69 came with a 
IRS tranny, where the sides bolt to CV joints .  It is not a straight forward 
swap like the motor is.   
but you could get it turned into a swing axle bus tranny .
