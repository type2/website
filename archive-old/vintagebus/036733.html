 on the upholstery, buy the pre fit foam from TMI it makes it a lot
easier to install, and get the sisal padding while your at it, i think
for both seat bottom and back is under 50 dollars.


as for mr soon to be a daddy van bondo, it sounds like the wrong hockey
stick
the bus one has a little bend in it due to the position of where the
hockey stick exits the nose cone, about an inch lower(on a bus nose
cone), so when you install the beetle
hockey stick (113 311 541c) fits type 1 from 1961-1979, it turns the
hockey stick so the shift lever is off to the side and it seems reverse
is hard to find, (i have done this before), a not so easy fix is to put
the trans in reverse or what ever gear you like and position the
shifter in the bus where you like it, and redrill a dimple in the
hockey stick, at least this will give you all gears, but probally will
seem a little sloppy feeling. otherwise pull the trans and put the bus
hockey stick, don't know if available new, but used shouldn't be hard
to find.

this is just my opinion and in no way tells you what your problem may
or may not be.

ps, no Y2K problems all shop and home computers running like a dream

&gt; Hi all: 
&gt; I've been working on installing new TMI seat covers on my truck's
seats
&gt; today.  As I took off the old covers ( not original ) most of the
sharp,
&gt; pointy spikes broke off.  A trial fit of the new covers show not much
&gt; extra material to work with and attach to the springs with hog rings.
&gt; Any suggestions on how to attach the covers?  BTW did I mess up by
&gt; buying 2&quot; thick foam instead of 1&quot;?    I hope not!  : )
&gt; TIA

First of all, never break off all those little triangular
thingies....Doh! ( Been there done that...:()
But now that you have....what I have done in the past is to first of c
all, replace that string stuff in the edges with some good welding rod,
oxy-acetylene stuff. like 1/32&quot; or thinner than a coat hanger...or a
coat hanger if thats all you got. Or you can re-use the stuff in the old
upholstery. Then where ever you still have a pointy thing, use it, and
where you broke off the spikes, carefully pre-drill some holes and use a
screw. This is a semi-okie fix. but if done carefully, can save the day
and be nearly un-noticable. If you are going for trailer-queen looker or
show winner, then take everything to the upholstery shop before you do
more damage.
