When I lived in Austin, TX a few years back, they enacted a simular law.
Basically they have to get a complaint in order to pursue the matter. So
they came &amp; tagged my VW 's &amp; my roomates '73 caddy limo &amp; '72 impala
convertable. The funny thing is that unless you came up &amp; actuallly tried
to start these vehicles, you'd have no idea they were in-operable. So then
if you don't comply they take your vehicles &amp;  auction them off. They end
up auctioning off about 75 cars a week. Very sad. Fortunatly I moved to
&quot;white trash&quot; west texas &amp; can stack VW's as high as I want now (as long as
the wife allows it!) It's funny that Austin has the reputation for being
liberal. Yeh right!
