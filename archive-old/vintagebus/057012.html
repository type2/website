&gt; VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. DONATES 25 VANS TO NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT

&gt;
&gt; Volkswagen will begin loaning the EuroVans, a mid-size van that provides
&gt; abundant space for people and cargo, to the NYC Fire Department beginning
&gt; this weekend.  All vans will be specially prepped and equipped by the

short-wave
&gt; radios, sirens, and logos.

Translation:  The Eurovan hasn't exactly been flying out of the dealers
and VW has a lot of leftovers that they'd have to sell at fire-sale prices
to get rid of.  Instead, VW _loans_ them to the NYFD (which isn't
exactly hurting for donations these days!) for a few months, and takes
a nice big tax writeoff.  They then get the Eurovans back with 10-15K
miles on them and sell them as &quot;low mileage used vehicles&quot; for about what
they could have sold them for as leftovers.  It costs VW nothing, they get
a nice tax break on the diffrence between the list price and what the
vehicles are really worth as leftovers, and they get some feel-good
publicity in the bargain.
