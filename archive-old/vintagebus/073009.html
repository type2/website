Subject: Re: [VB] I GIVE UP !!

would anybody care to venture a guess what happened, and what is actually
broken ?
---------------------- Clip ----------------------
I've been messing with VWs for a long time. (I use the term because most
are a mess by the time they fall into my hands).
It's hard to thrown stones at someone when you don't know all the facts
about your particular engine unless you're the one that disassembled it,
cleaned the case and reassembled it.
I've found various welds, nut-certs, heli coils and welded up oil
galleries plugs, filed on case halves not to mention the 'split it with a
big hammer' marks inside the flywheel area.
When a bus has had several previous owners and most likley several engine
rebuilds who can you blame it on?
I think you should be waiting for the shop to give a report on what
they've found.
Replacing a clutch cable can't be blamed for any cracked, broken engine
or tranny case problem ........ with my many years of experience I just
see it as a syncronized parts failure that is all too commom with VWs of
older vintage.
In other words if it isn't one thing, it's another and so goes the never
ending tinkering process to keep a bus on the road.
If you invited everybody to tell one of their war stories we'd have one
hell of a posting party.
