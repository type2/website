Subject: Source for Pop-out screws?
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b35428971966_at_[207.136.16.24]&gt;

Anyone know where I can get a good lot of the little screws that hold the
pop-out window frames together? I'd rather pay an affordable price. So
maybe if someone has the size, I could find them at a local hardware or
&quot;nut &amp; bolt&quot; store. TIA.
