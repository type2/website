Subject: rust sorry

My question has probably already been answered, and I'm so sorry if it
has been.  I looked in the Archives and all sorts of places with no
luck.  The problem is Rust showing up all over my car.  My car had
been restored and so I would really like to stop the rust before it
does any damage.  The rust is eating away at the crome rims and hub
caps.  Its the insides of the hub caps that have the most rust.  There
is also rust on the crome ring around the headlights.  And what looks
like rust on the plastic turn signal lights for the front.  What
should I do?  I can't use POR15 for these places except for inside the
hub caps possibly.  Would CLR work or would it do more damage?  What
about spraying on some 10wD40?
TIA
