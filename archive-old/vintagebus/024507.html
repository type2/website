Subject: Re: Rants: tickets, insurance, etc

&gt; &gt; off, no headlights, wipers, bald tires, no turn signals, cracked 
&gt; &gt; windshield, but if you pass emissions, you're golden.
&gt; 
&gt; Not precisely true.  We don't have inspections, but it is still
&gt; illegal to drive with the unsafe conditions listed above.  Cops write
&gt; quite a few tickets for equipment violations.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I like it this way.  It goes back to the concept of being
&gt; innocent until proven guilty.  I'd resent having to go in every year
&gt; to prove to someone that my bus is &quot;innocent&quot; and is in good repair.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be really PO'd if some inspector dinged me for having a 1/4 inch
&gt; rock chip in my windshield.  No safety problem by any stretch of the
&gt; imagination, but technically it would require replacement in states
&gt; that require perfect windshields.
&gt; 
At the risk of beating this to death, I will defend the safety
inspection.

In Utah my Safety Inspection costs me about $10 annually and is a PITA,
especially in an old car. What it should buy me is a decreased
likelyhood of someone taking out my Bus due to neglected brakes (or
steering, tires, etc) failing on them! Sure, he would probably get a
ticket for driving a poorly maintained vehicle, but that is little
consolation.

Our inspection will also only reject the windshield if the driver's
vision is impaired (a bad thing?) or there is a crack that extends
between two sides. I don't know about laws in other states. Despite the
fact that my windshield is thrashed from all the g*dd*mn freeway
construction around here, it will still pass come January if I don't
take another rock directly in my field of vision. I hope not to put in
my spare until 2002 when the construction is done!

We should all be inspecting and maintaining our own vehicles, but you
know most people driving old vehicles aren't going to do that. In this
case, Big Brother is stepping in and forcing us all to think about it
once a year.
