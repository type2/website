&lt;&lt; I know everybody uses this term, but what does &quot;dielectric&quot; mean?  It 
can't mean &quot;two electric&quot; or &quot;bielectric&quot;. &gt;&gt;
Hi JP,
Hmm, we must be the only ones with a dictionary around!  ;-)

Dielectric; noun (dia + electric) Elec. A nonconducting material - 
dielectric, dielectrical, adj. - dielectrically, adv.   Webster's Collegiate 
Dictonary, Fifth Edition, 1948.

In other word while any grease would help seal out the oxygen from getting to 
the cleaned brass connector pieces.  Most grease types have a metalic or 
other type of conductive material like graphite which would cause voltage to 
bleed across points in switches and in other electrical areas!
