Subject: RE: Tranny Problems &amp; Rancho

I've had a Rancho Tranny now for about 4000 miles.  I'm happy as a pig
in mud.

I got mine with the 3.88 and aluminum side covers on both sides.  Welded
syncros, all the goodies.  Cost about $800.

I'm as happy as a pig in mud.  It's quite. It's strong, probably
stronger than necessary. And it's clean.

The only thing I can suggest is to be sure to change the $6 boots at the
same time.

If you are going to have it that far down, you might as well redo the
redux boxes also.  Just a thought.
