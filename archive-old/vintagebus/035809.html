Now we know who the devious individual is who gets into our locked engine 
compartments.
What an obvious and smart way of checking things if you lose you engine key! 
But I think you have to remove both rear lights and a second hand available.
BTW I can't get the latch mechanism off, to replace the hole cover.One of the 
Phillips head screws is completely stuck and I have to drill it out.
