No, don't rebuild the master cylinder just yet.  Check the following:
Rubber line between frame and wheel cylinder.  The rubber gets old, can
crack internally, then pinch off once pressurized.
Wheel cylinder, make sure that both of them are in good condition, not
rusted or leaking.  The fact that you have REAL GOOD brakes on the right
indicates that there's a problem on the left.  But don't ignore the
right side. Check these same things on the right if you don't find
anything n the left.
