Subject: Empi five spokes won't fit.

From my experience if you are running the reduction boxes at stock
height the Empi's won't fit. You could maybe squeeze a 135 on there but
if you are doing this in the name of safety and to make it handle well
then I would think your best bet is to find a set of 14&quot; bus wheels with
the lip. They have the right offset and you can run a wide tire on it.
