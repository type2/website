Subject: Hula Girls!!!

Anyone who knows my friend Dan Kinsey who now resides in Florida remembers
his Binz which was recently pictured next to another Binz at the Nov. 11th
VW show down there.  Last June and July I got the chance to not only ride
with Dan in the Binz but work on that VW rarity itself.

One thing I always liked is that Dan had his accessories - his large EMPI
tach, his EMPI steering wheel, factory safari's, and the Hula Girl on the
dash that seemingly danced to the Red Elvises encouraged by the inward rush
of air from the safaris.

I went on a mission tonight on the net looking for hula girls.  I found a
lot of them but there are plenty of them that are ugly.  Some are out of
proportion and others have grass skirts that are bulky or look like a green
tinted lock of My Little Pony mane hair.

I finally found a unique Hula Girl that I really like.  There are 3 styles
to choose from.  They are rather realistic underneath their clothes but I'm
going to keep my Hula Girl fully clothed at all times.  If you wanna see
them, go to
http://www.bobbingheads_dot_net/Hulagirls.htm but keep in mind that if you click
on Item 600, 601, or 602 you'll have the hula girl version of a strip tease.
Despite this, I'm going to get one because I think they are stylish and they
look good. Hey, I can always dream. :-)

Enjoy.
