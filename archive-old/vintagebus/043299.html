&gt; I got a letter in the mail to day from my city watchdogs and it seems
&gt; that I am in violation of not one but three city sections by parking my
&gt; truck in the driveway.  I guess the clincher was the non-op German NSU
&gt; parked along side it and under a tarp.  I have 10 days to get them out
&gt; of the driveway or &quot;face further legal action&quot;.

I had the same problem but I managed to get em tagged and insured and then
there was very little they could do about it.  my city also has an
ordinance that says a vehicle that hasn't moved in xx number of days (5 I
think) is presumed to be abandoned and can be towed to the impound lot,
but this is only from the street not someones property.

(but once I did have one on the street and I moved it back and forth
between two parking spots every couple days by pushing it, it met the
letter of the law and they couldn't touch it.)

basically I told em to &quot;Stuff it&quot; and they finally let me alone, finally
got it restored and it left of it's own accord (new owner)

Now it was only one van, and it was on my own property so that may have
made a difference.

my suggestion is familiarize yourself with the local codes, there is
almost always a loophole you just need to find it.  (might talk to the
local vintage car club, there might be a antique car exemption, and most
VW's do meet the requirment for vintage car)
in this case you don't fight fire with fire, but rather a bucket, find the
legal way around it.

good luck
Bob
