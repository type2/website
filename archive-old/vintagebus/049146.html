So it's that tromp l' oel stuff?  Could be a fertile canvas for the Martha Stewart crowd. Painted on crow's feet, shadowbox semaphores, extra windows painted on kombi's and panels. Peel-off rust decals to put on just for Jerome! Painted on skylights and sunroofs! It's a vast rolling canvas. 

Made a run up to Boonville and Hopland in CA this weekend. Saw a kombi east of 5 and south of the Patterson offramp in the Central valley.  Bumperless, at a farm near other trucks.  Caught sight of an 11 window non-deluxe in Sebastpol. Then, at the Solar festival in Hopland, plenty of hippies, but no split vans!  A nice electric powered Porsche spyder gave Ralph Nader a ride to the podium, but only bays in the parking lot, and they were few.
