&gt;ok ok, no that I understand how they work, how are they to install? (hard,
&gt;easy, hurt the car? etc)
&gt;

I don't know if this was made clear, but swamp coolers only work in dry
climates (i.e. west and southwest). That's why you're not familiar with
them, they're not used in the east or southeast. I doubt you would like it
very much in Pennsylvania, not much cooling and more mildew.
