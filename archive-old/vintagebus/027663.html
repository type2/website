Terry,

I want to let you know that humiliation was the last thing on my mind.  Identity is important to all.  I would do the same if someone was using your clubs logo.  Thanks for being so cool about everything.  Believe me, I am not the logo police.  I just happened to notice the logo because I've been wearing the damm T shirts for the last two years.

Thanks again!

Steve

BTW I'm not even sure that the logo is OCTO property.  I'll look into it.
