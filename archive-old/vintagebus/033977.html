Subject: Stub axle threads messed up, know size?
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 2000 14:33:07 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Guys,
 
When I took apart the redux boxes on the back of my '64
for my rebuild, I noticed that the threads where the castellated
nut goes on are all boogerd up.
 
Either I get it turned and rethreaded, buy an new stub shaft
or see if I can clean it up with a die.
 
Anyone have ideas as well?  
 
Anyone know the thread size, pitch and diameter so I could
buy a die?
 
Joe
