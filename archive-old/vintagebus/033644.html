Take the wheels and tires off and roll it in on it's drums. That's how I
work on the upper body sections of buses (when I ever get around to it) and
works slick. You can even push a bus sideways on the drum edges if you have
smooth concrete without any cracks in it. No it doesn't wear the edges of
the drum down, at least not for me.

Subject: [VB] Fitting my bus in my garage 


Long time lurker, first time poster!!

I have recently moved from an apartment to a house with a garage.  I
finally have a place to work on my '60 Kombi.  There is only one
problem, my garage with garage door hardware seems to only have
approx. 6' of clearance while my bus measures out at about approx. 6'
1&quot;.  I was wondering if any one has ideas/suggestions for getting my
bus into the garage so I can get to work on it.

I believe that pulling the wheels off and dropping it onto some type
of wheeled aparatus would be the way to go, since I plan to do some
major work on the bus (body and engine).

I have seen small metal dollies with casters on them but no idea where
to buy them ( I am in Vancouver B.C). Are these any good.  The ones
that I have seen on the web are expensive.  Is it possible to build a
set of dollies from wooden timbers and caster wheels.  Or has anyone
made any of these dollies from metal, and how have they worked.

No, I don't want to just let the air out of the tires!

Hoping to pick the lists collective brain.

Thanks

Stew
