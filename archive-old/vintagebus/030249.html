I went and looked at that one about this time last year... braved a Blizzard
and drove 100 miles to see it.  The guy gave me 3 15&quot; bus rims just for coming
down... thought it was worth my trouble i guess... I even stayed in Madison
that night because the storm was so bad....real cool guy...had a few other
buses too...bays though.  That bus was an absolute rot box.  Thats an
understatement... I didn't feel safe sitting in the thing.  It was complete
though...had a REALLY nice rear binz only seat, all the glass, nice cut down
gates, the badge, full bulkhead, etc...even the original engine...but it had
some odd bumpers...oh yeah...had the door too.  The interior was all the
original dove blue...but the exterior had some crazy 70's paint job on it.  It
did sell...i forget to who or for what price...but it did sell.... I was going
to buy it...until I saw it in person.  Way to rotten for me...and I would have
felt bad parting out a BINZ.
I think thats all...
