Hey list---
I know that this is getting redundant, but, I need a bra for the bus and was 
planning on getting one from Dawn_at_PLF. I got a sundial repro tent from her 
last spring and am VERY impressed with its quality----
The sale went without a hitch and we were both happy campers. 
Anyway---I was going to have her make a bra to match my Sealing Wax Red bus, 
but I need it within a month or so? Suggestions?

If that doesn't work out, which I really hope it does, who else makes bras w/ 
emblems on them (I know it'd be black)

I'm gonna give her a call tommorrow and hopefully things will work out!!

Wish me luck-Pete
