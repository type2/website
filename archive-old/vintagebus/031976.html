Cool! I'm glad you guys mentioned this. They're gonna be here in Knoxville tonight.
They've been here before and I probably would have skipped it this time, but
since there's a Heb in the race I'll go for sure.

I'll be there in my crewcab, that'll probably be the whole vintage VW turnout
here in Knoxville. 8^)

&gt;And Bill Collins will be entered again in his Heb - the first and only VW to

&gt;have ever participated.

&gt;&gt;    You all know what the Great Race is, right. Well, our illustrious tourism

&gt;&gt; board somehow talked them, Great Race (sponsored by the History Channel)
to
&gt;&gt; make Lake Havasu one of there overnight resting places. So here's the deal,

&gt;&gt; on Thursday the 28 of June they arrive in Havasu, at 5pm the city is having

&gt;&gt; a little street fair in there honor, the cool part is that the streets (main

&gt;&gt; street) downtown will be lined with VINTAGE vehicles, including all the VW

&gt;&gt; Buses. so if anybody wants to come and see or join in feel free to come.
