Well i finally gave in and took the bus to a &quot;professional shop&quot;  The only 
thing that they could tell was wrong was the jets in the carb and the timing 
was just a hair off.  So now i got it back and it seems to STILL be running 
too hot.  By too hot I mean that the engine lid is way hot as is the bumper.  
The engine itself is hot and smells like its burning.  

So now im down to the very real possibility of a spun main bearing.  Just 
looking for some tips on getting in there, inspecting and repairing.  ooks 
like Ill need a new case if this is so.  i dont have an engine # on the case 
but Im pretty sure its a mexican single relief and it has that weird rubber 
cam plug.  Anyone have a source for one?
