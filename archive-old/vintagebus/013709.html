&gt;Hi ,
&gt;
&gt;I'm Marc from Montréal who's got a 1963 Deluxe Microbus 21 windows. It's a 
&gt;nine-seaters. I've bought it 3 years ago in California near San
&gt;Francisco. The engine is a Porche 912 1776 cc dual carb, it has 3000
&gt;miles. All the mechanical has been done, so everything works,
&gt;everything's new. Most of the parts are from West Coast Metric and I've got 
&gt;a brand new NOS steering wheel from Koch's. The radio is missing but the 
&gt;emplacement has not been patched. The floor pan is very nice, no rust a 
&gt;hall, yes the suspension is lowered (Californian fashion...). The color you 
&gt;see it's not the original colors, it's suppose to be coral...  It only 
&gt;needs a new interior ( seats cover, etc.), and a new paint to make it show 
&gt;winner.9000$ US obo

If you are fallowing the type 2 marcket, my bus is a good investment.

I have pics if interest....

Marc
