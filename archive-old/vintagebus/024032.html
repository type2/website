This sounds like a classic throw-out bearing symptom.  You will almost
certainly have to pull the engine to take a look.  Could be a bad
bearing, the throw-out arm may be misaligned, there may be a problem
with the pressure plate, or maybe even the clutch disk.  You may want to
try making sure the clutch cable adjustment is OK before you tear into
it.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Hate to keep bugging everyone, but this bus is acting up again.  Drove her to
&gt; work today (10 miles each way) On the way home, sitting at a stoplight, clutch
&gt; pedal depressed, I start to hear a moaning-grinding sort of sound.  Put her in
&gt; neutral, let clutch pedal out, sound goes away. Push it in and it's back. Just
&gt; had the trans and clutch replaced so I'm certain it's related.  Maybe the
&gt; clutch plate is still making contact?  What do you think?
