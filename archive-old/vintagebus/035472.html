Subject: Re: [VB] Correct torque for single port manifolds
To: aborgman_at_ichips.intel_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

On the little M 6 studs with the 10mm nuts I use the stubby ratchet, as it is 
easy to break them with a regular one.  I go for about 7fts lbs, but then 
again, I just tighten it till it feels right, hopelessly unscientific.   I 
snug both sides down, then tighten the awkward side you need a wrench on the 
final tightening first.  You have a nice new copper crush washer gasket 0 
ring in there, right, and have the manifold ends lined up well, right?  so 
you are just smooshing that copper O ring to seal it.

 So which is it folks? This is a single port intake manifold from a 1964
 1500, which is now being bolted to a new 1600 SP. 6mm studs... The Bentley
 for 1961-1967 doesn't say, just says to tighten evenly by hand. The Wilson
 book and apstockton_at_hotmail_dot_com say 14 ft. lbs.. VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com says
 6 ft. lbs. like the sump nuts. 
 
 I've tried 14 ft. lbs., and snapped one of the studs. So is it really 6
 ft. lbs. and I'm one the way to ruining more studs if I torque to 14 ft.
 lbs?
