&lt;&lt; I removed the cancer pods from my heater system last year thinking I was
 getting more than my Recommended Daily Allowance of asbestos and I can
 really hear fan/exhaust noise through the heater vents, especially from
 the windshield vents.

Hi Everett,
As far as we have seen VW never used asbestos in the heating system.  Instead
they used fiber glass cloth for insulation and sound damping.  Asbestos is
grey and soft, not at all like the white and very hard, like the long
fiberglass fibers.
