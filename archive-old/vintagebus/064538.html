Subject: Re: [VB] new bus won't start

Check all the battery and starter electrical connections, then hit as
many as you can in a day while you are at it. Might be loose or bad
connections. Also tranny ground strap to chassis (especially if the
heater boxes aren't hooked up to body. And of course main ground
strap/wire.

&gt; Argh....my new 66 won't start, it tries to turn but the starter sounds 
&gt; really weak. I have a volt meter thing and test the battery the battery is 
&gt; putting out 6 Volts
