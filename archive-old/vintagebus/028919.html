Subject: Engine update

I punched out for a couple of hours today, pulled my engine, and checked
the endplay. I used a tool that clamps to the case and allows you to
measure the endplay with feeler gauges...

I set the endplay at 0.004 yesterday, and today I measured 0.006. My
boss didn't recommend tightening it up (the instructions with the
endplay tool specify 0.003 to 0.005), so I reinstalled the engine.

I'd been missing the part of the engine seal that goes on the apron, so
I went ahead and installed it. The rest of the seals are new, and all
excess holes in the tin are covered.

My engine ran a bit cooler this morning on the way to work, but I
expected that, since the outside temp was cooler. On the way home from
work, it ran even better. It idled at the stoplights, and the light only
flickered a little at idle.

So, I guess having a sealed engine compartment is a major factor in how
cool my engine runs, but there are a couple of other factors I'd like to
bounce off of you more experienced listers out there...

1) My dual Kadrons are only tuned by ear, and I haven't messed with the
air correction jets yet, so maybe they're running a little lean...

2) I'm wondering if all the new stuff (rod and main bearings, cam and
cam bearings, lifters, oil pump) generate heat while breaking in.

Comments?
