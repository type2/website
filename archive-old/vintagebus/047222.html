 I intend to bastardize the Westy and buy nylon/plastic
 inserts for the holes, cut all of the panels out of
 Baltic Birch to match the rest of the interior and
 screw them in place. I'm over the VintageNazi thing
 and prefer a bus that works and stays together. Take
 it from me- the clips are a pain in the ass and will
 tend to pop out and allow the expensive but nice repop
 panels to warp and tweak due to the moisture. Even in
 bone dry Southern Arizona mine eventually got warped.
 Headliner and kicks remain nice.

iF YOU HAD PUT plastic under the panels, tucked the bottoms into the 
doors,attached with duct tape, before installing your door panels, the door 
panels would not have warped whether you had secured them with the snap 
clips, screws, superglue or whatever.  well, mine haven't, and it rains 
frequently in the PNW.  This with  door panels cut out of 1/8 hardboard 
rattle can grey, look fine. 

 I sanded the non seen side to make it thinner around the edges so the clips 
(scrounged from junkyard buses) would work.  Done this with several buses, 
really helps against the warp factor.  VW used wax paper, which I am sure 
worked for a while, but falls apart after a while.  I recommend plastic under 
any and all door panels, as the doors are designed for water to run through 
them, so it will, and bounce aginst whatever is there.

You can flatten old panels by soaking them with a garden hose, placing them 
flat on a driveway (avoid oil spots) put a piece of plywood over the panels 
weighed down with old batteries, toolbxes or what have you, let dry, then 
reinstall over the plastic layer.  

works for me.
