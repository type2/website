Erin, 
Could you please tell your friend to kindly push in the clutch petal when he 
starts his stalled out vee dub? It would unload that nasty Todd Hill tranny 
that he was driving around even though he knew it was sick...spins over 
faster I guarantee.
Our hero is guilty of abusing his kombi by driving it even though it pops out 
of 3rd gear going up 4% grades and Todd got no ware near it's tailend.
We all thrash our antiques and then wonder why they don't perform like that 
$20,000 SUV that just cut us off in the slow lane.
Shoot fire! ya kin buy a house an 20 acre in the ozarks for the price o one a 
dem...you know where you can stick that cell phone too.
keep on trucken
