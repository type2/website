Hi Gene,
If you are reffering to the type of oil pump with the filter mounted on its 
cover, then the ansewer for the present is yes.  We have used vintage EMPI 
oil filter/pumps that mount the filter off to the right side, but all the 
modern day oil filter/pumps have the oil filter hanging off the left side.  
Making the filter take the same space as the left side tube to the preheat 
tube in the intake manifold coming out of the front of the stocker type 1 &amp; 2 
mufflers.  We have cut, angled, welded, and redrilled the oil passages back 
through these modern oil filter/pumps so the filter is just below this tube, 
but not so low as to stick it out from below the engine.  So far the CB 
version of these made by Shradek are the best ones made today and can be 
bought for about $60.00.  If you do the cutting and champhering yourself you 
should be able to have a welding shop weld it for about $30.00-40.00, and 
then you just redrill the holes back through.
