I originally replied back via pmail to Dan on this one, but there may be
others out there that may be considering the same thing as well.

Additional info to add to the general discussion:

1.  Cable modem technology may or may not be available in your local area.
If you have Time-Warner as your cable TV company you can check if it is
available to you by going to http://www.roadrunner_dot_com.  You can put your
zip code in and it will tell you.  If you have TCI as your cable provider
the Cable modem service is called _at_home.  You can check into availability by
going to http://www.tci_dot_com and entering your zip code.

2.  DSL stands for  'digital subscriber link'.  I wont go into geeky
details, but the end result is that it gives you fast internet access and
runs over your existing telephone lines.  You need t check with your local
phone company to see if it is available in your area.

3.  As far as computer systems are concerned, Compaq, HP and IBM (and
Gateway too!) all make excellent systems for home use (if you do the
go-to-the-store route).  All are about equal  in price and performance.
Your best bet often is to see who has the best prices on any given day.  If
you do the on-line thing, you might want to look at Dell (or Gateway if
there is not a local store around you).

4.  You dont have to give up AOL if you get a cable modem or DSL connection,
_but_ you will still have to pay the $19.95 a month in addition to the cable
modem/DSL access fees.

Like I told Dan, feel free to drop me a line via pmail if you have questions
concerning computer access and systems.  Im still sorta 'green behind the
ears' when it comes to busses, but I know a thing or two about computers (I
consider that a fair trade for all you have done for me since last July
!!!!)

&gt; Hey Dan;
&gt; I would consider junking the computer (or giving it to the kids) and
getting
&gt; a new one.  Hardware pricing has gone thru the floor in the past 2 years
or
&gt; so.  For considerably less than $1500 (excluding monitor) you can pick up:
&gt; PIII processor
&gt; 128MB RAM
&gt; 13 or 16GB (I am not sure what the latest and greatest is at this time)
Hard
&gt; Disk drive
&gt; Sound, speakers, whistles and bells
&gt; --- For an additional $250 (approximate) or less, you can get a great deal
&gt; on a 17&quot; monitor as well.
&gt;
&gt; National chains like Best Buys have a good selection out there, or there
are
&gt; lots of places on the Internet if you want to go the 'on-line' route.
&gt;
&gt; ...One additional item to consider
&gt; If you are concerned about internet access, your greatest choke pont in
&gt; performance is probably  the connection speed to AOL.  No doubt you are
&gt; connecting via a modem.  There are two technologies you should look into
to
&gt; replace your modem;  cable modems and DSL.  Not knowing where you are at,
&gt; these may not be available (but one probably is).
&gt; The cost is about $150 for installation and $40 a month.  Its a little
&gt; pricey (but you can drop the 2nd phone line if you have one dedicated
&gt; computer and save about $20 a month), but your internet access speeds will
&gt; increase as much as ten-fold.
&gt;
&gt; You _could_ bump the memory (a couple of hundred dollars would do it) and
go
&gt; the cable modem/DSL route, but you will probably be ripping the system out
&gt; in a year so so anyway.  A PIII processor machine will probably buy you 3
&gt; years of 'happy service'.
&gt;
&gt; If you find something (I'm a computer geek and do H/W procurement for a
&gt; 2500+ user corporation) and would like me to help you with the selection
&gt; process, email me back.  I would be glad to help.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm looking at upgrading my (PC) computer so I can do things a little
&gt; faster
&gt; &gt; on the Internet - Mostly VW related stuff.  Would like to start a Binz
&gt; &gt; webpage and similar stuff.  My current system works but is a bit slugish
&gt; &gt; compared to my work computer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The wife can get a $2000 interest free loan from work for anything
&gt; computer
&gt; &gt; related.  Nice perk eh?  Right now I have a 100mhz pentium with 32meg of
&gt; ram.
&gt; &gt; My question is: Is it worth the money to drop $2000 on a Pentium 3
system
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; do I just upgrade what I have with more memory and a faster modem...or
&gt; &gt; something in between?  All opinions appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Dan
&gt; &gt;
