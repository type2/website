&gt;  just disconnect the latch from the inside of the body.  Then on the outside

&gt; er... yes.   I have also bent frames doing this.    but then again, they 
&gt; could probably be un bent.

Wouldnt the easiest way be to take your cordless Milwaulkee (they are the
best, never seen any other brand take a 70 foot drop to rocks and live,
hehe) drill and drill out the spot welds?

Or maybe a nice sharp wood chisel to break the spot welds...

I'm just thinkin out loud, no personal experience..
