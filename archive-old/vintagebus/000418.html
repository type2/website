&lt;&lt; hey guys...
 anyone want to decode my ID tag for me? I went to the m-code page and
 other pages but it was all a mess to me...
 my code is as follows
 
 03 5   ========production date - day/month- 3rd May
 426 114-6 popouts-======426 sounds like N american specs
 US ====port in USA it was sent to
 2213 ==== model- standard micro
TK BLW ==== colours
   1308743 ==== VIN 
 
 thanks!
 i have the small rear hatch and all too....kind of confusion since there
 was a change from 63-64 and things like that...
 i know it was built in march as my engine vents are pressed inwards..

sounds perfectly straightforward.  

64s have large rear hatches
