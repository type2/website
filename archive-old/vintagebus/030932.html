&gt;Unless you talk to every single buyer (and they are honest...how many of
us fudge on the price we pay for things??) how can you be sure of the number???
&gt;
&gt;Just because something sold fast does not mean that it sold for (or even
close to) the asking price. Especially for some of the extremely inflated
asking prices that show up in the classifieds. How many &quot;REDUCED&quot; ads do
you see week after week on cars/busses that started out WAY high???
&gt;
Yes, I completely agree.  In this particular case, I personally had conversations
with quite a few of sellers and they indicated their vehicles sold as a
direct result of ads on my site and the approx. or exact sale price.  Yes,
they could have lied and yes, there is actually some leeway built into my
claim, in addition to the many sales of which I am not aware.

In general, I usually assume anything that sells in under a day as priced
very competitively and thus garners a sale price close to, or at, the full
price.  There are VWs that languish for months on end, the perfect example
is this Bus:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/classifieds.mv?view+photo+200104082116351872
which has been on my site for about a year.  I have tried to drop hints
to the seller that the price is quite high based on the description and
photos to no avail.

Perhaps everybody got their tax refunds back?  I prefer to pay.  ;(

&gt;The site is fantastic though Everett...keep it up!!
&gt;
Thanks!
