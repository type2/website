&gt; There was a lot of stuff there but everyone seemed to still have a lot of stuff at the end of the day - rear bumpers, tin, EMPI wheels, NOS parts, roof racks, etc., weird.

That's because people are finally fed up with paying insane prices...hopefully!

As for prices, how about I didn't see a slash rear bumper for less than 100 (that was with out overiders too).  There was a nice painted one, but it was a buck and a half....too rich for me.  I think I'll end up welding the slash ends on a good center.  There was the guy who wanted  $150 for a washer bottle and the top was junk.  He also had some deals on side steps....they were only $100.  No wonder people went home with parts.  The only good deal I got was from Craig!  Thanks for the mirrors Craig.  I also got a gen. stand with filler and cap for a buck, that made me happy.  Oh yeah also bought two round mirrors from Ronnie for the Double Cab.  I was
bummed that I couldn't find the correct hump backed front seat for the DC, although I did see a nice blue 62 DC in the lot with the correct seat and verified my assumption of what the correct one was.

Matthew and I met Thom in the parking lot and he gave us a ride in the yellow panel back into the park after he was cleared to enter.  Very cool to drive down the middle of all the busses lined up, people jumping out of Thom's way...thanks Thom.

Nice show again this year, but they will need to put the swap down in the lot and kick the customs and water pumper to the curb next year!   Good to see Ronnie, Thom, VW Howard, Craig, Robert and all the others.   KP it never disappoints.

Steve
