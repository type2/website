Hey all,
The other night I went over to a friends place to play some roller hockey
and parallel parked behind a full-size C#*%y pick-up, and went I came out
to my bus to leave, the truck was gone and there was a *huge* dent in the
front of my bus!!!  I was fuming because the SOB didn't even leave a
note!  So I've been searching the town of Moscow, ID for a white/blue '90s
pick-up so I can get the license plate #.  Point of this story:  there are
a lot of idiot red-necks driving big 4x4 trucks that just don't give a
damn what they run into!  Watch out.

Adam &quot;Beefcake&quot; Bruno
