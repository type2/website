Subject: Re: [VB] blowing hot air

I don't think I'm a &quot;know it all&quot;, but, being that the Heater Tubes were
only LOOSE, I don't think that caused the engine to overheat.  Being loose,
and having the heater on should be close to the same.  So that should not be
the culprit.  The setting of the valves, and clean oil will give you a much
better controlled subject so that was a good thing. With good compression
(and I'm assuming good oil pressure, since you didn't mention the light),
the only things that I could see as potential problems are 1. Timing (I know
you said you checked it, but hey, it's the #1 overheating reason around here
in Louisiana), 2. the flaps are stuck shut on the bottom of the fan shroud,
or the oil cooler is semi plugged.

As far as the air blowing out of the heater ducts on the housing, it won't
help the engine, but the air isn't heated coming out of there, and will just
recycle back into the shroud, so it's not necessarily hurting it either.

Later

P.S. Check to see if the cylinders have that little piece of metal under
them to deflect the air,  I've seen way too many engines without them being
built by reputable shops.
