&gt; the other side of the T-fiting.  Is this a good place to get an oil

&gt; to make things complicated :)

Chris,

IMHO, this is a *terrible* place to get oil temperature!  You want a place
where the oil is moving past the sender, and at the top of a tube, off to
one side of a &quot;T&quot; fitting is not it.  The positively idea place would be
in the stream entering or exiting the oil pump or cooler, but it is damned
difficult to plumb it in there.  Most people go for temp in the sump, as
Berg's dipstick sender does and the drain plate sender does.  Both of
these have the advantage that they read the temperature of the oil right
after it has come off the bearings with a slight disadvantage that the
temperature is affected (slightly, IMHO) by the temperature of the case.
