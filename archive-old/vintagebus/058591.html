Subject: Re: [VB] Seals for the gas tank doors in the 66 SC treasure chest

My very original 62 DC did not have any seals in that area.  That said the
PO (second owner) did install a bay tank and could have removed them when
doing the conversion.

&gt; hmmmm, that's interesting... no seals eh?  I could have sworn there were
&gt; some remnants of a black strip similar to the seal on the fresh air vent
on
&gt; one of my panels when I removed it originally off my 59 dc... then again,
it
&gt; could have been some black goo a PO put there...
&gt; 
&gt; anybody else with some insight????

&gt; If so we do ot know of any seals there and have none on our two 63 SCs.
&gt; Also
&gt; the bus parts manual shows no seals for there.
