&gt;Has anyone out there installed A/C in their Splittie? I am looking for
&gt;advice on how to do it.


When I bought my singlecab it had A/C installed. The condensor was for a
bus, between the frame rails. Compressor was one of them rotary ones for
race cars, don't know who makes them. The evaporator end was from a Karmann
Ghia. It was a nice setup, fit perfect and looked factory. Made the interior
of the cab sweat, big rust promotor. Took it out and swapped it away. I'll
be driving the Ch&amp;vy if I want A/C. They're still making them, you know.
