&gt; I would be happy to make a copy or two if someone had one to loan in the

&gt; be scanned legally and put online ?

If what WW is outright selling is an unauthorized copy (from what I understand
from list mails it is) then I'd be willing to put it online for free.  If they
have some kind of permission though it's probably not a good idea for anybody
to put it online...to me the objective of putting old VW manuals online is not
to remove the market for republication (hard copies are great!) but to provide
material not &quot;legitimately&quot; published.  Bad Xerox(R) copies to me don't count
as legit publishing :-)

To answer your previous email to me (and to notify the list) I'm still having
trouble with the PDFs...I found a cache of old ones but some of those are even
bad.  If you're interested in the status, check the site occasionally.  School
keeps me busy but I hope to have everything fixed within days at the most.

BTW I need a volunteer using Windows Adobe Acrobat Reader (newest ver) to check
that the PDFs I am making work with it, I'm using a free compression format
that just might not work with it.  It should, but I'd like to check before I 
make a mess.  It works on my system but I don't use Windows or Acrobat...
