Subject: Re: [VB] Carburetor Rebuild Question

Hi Tom,
If the pin was missing and a nail was used afterward, most likely the hole is wallowed out.  Better to take the carb in question to your local hardware store and get a solid or rolled pin that will fit.  Most likely you will also need to drill the a little hole deeper and slightly bigger.  
  A quicky fix for this that can last for quite a while is to loop a paper clip around the nearest top of carb screw (with screw backed out and tightened down after) and bend the rest of the clip around cam and into the pin hole.  Having the proper pin is better than this fix in the long run.
