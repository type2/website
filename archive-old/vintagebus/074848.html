Subject: Aussie 62 Doublecab progress

Greetings All,

Thought I'd offer a few pix on progress on
my current project - a somewhat crusty 62 double cab.

Here's work on the LHS.  Inner rocker and replacing
bottom of posts.  Had to cut quite high to find good
metal.  For all you US'ers RHS double cabs still have
a suicide passengers door!

Outer rockers going on...

Had to fab and replace quite a bit of metal in the front
LHS wheel well and bottom of B pillar.  New dogleg will covver
most of this.

View from passengers cab (what you see just before the
suicide door springs open and you fall out!)

Pulled the rear subfloor out and found this (urk!)

But he's slowly getting better

Just got to work back up the outer RHS now!

DC is going to be done in a red oxide primer look.  However,
because red oxide is not waterproof I'll bare metal it and paint
the whole thing with rust bullet first!  BRMs  BRMs  BRMs (probably
Midland wheel repos still cost a fortune here) and tilt!

later all
