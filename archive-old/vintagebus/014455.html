Hi Daniel,
First off you need to change the oil if it is more than 6 months old after
being run even only five minutes.  Are those fuel lines less than two to
three years old if not then replace all of them.  Is the fuel tank full?  If
not add new fuel to thin down the old.  Charge the battery up.  It would not
be a bad idea to remove the positive wire to the coil and turn the engine
over till the oil pressure light goes out.  Replace the coil wire and try to
start it.  Eric&amp;Barb
