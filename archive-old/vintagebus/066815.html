Subject: Re: [VB] Transport companies

Hi Dre,

  When I transported the Side Loader from PHX, everything seemed to work
and I got it to NJ in a couple of weeks.  The driver called and said I had
to pick it up on Rt. 1 since he could not drive the rig through Princeton.
Since I have a store to run by myself, it was particularly difficult to
find a ride and close my store on 15 min. notice.

  It all happened so quickly, I forgot to really do my part and inspect
the bus when I picked it up, I gladly tipped the driver $20 and drove it
home. When I finally got a grip, I looked in the bed area and it was full
of grease (and a little chalk that I knew was in there).  When I cleaned
it I noticed many dents that were not there before, and the antenna and
other parts Ronnie gave me were gone!

  Apparently, somewhere, someone put a motor, front end, transmission, or
some big heavy greasy part, and stole anything that wasn't bolted down. I
was kinda upset that I paid good money and even tipped for some lousy
service.

   I don't know who's fault it was, and when I inquired to the transport
company, there was no apology, no recourse, and I learned yet another
lesson &quot;let the buyer beware.&quot;  You've got the right attitute now,
remember to slow down and inspect it when it arrives.  Don't tip if they
did a poor job.

Dre writ:

well, it's not the driver's fault you know..... I would tip him anyway....
but it will all depend on the overall experience with the guy plus on the
condition of the Bus when it arrives. I don't want to see any scratches
not to mention dents....

how much should I tip him?
