 long overdue oil change-
 how much oil do i put back into my 1600 cc engine after i drain it-and what 
 kind of filter is it? its a '67 bus. can i find the filter at a regular 
 parts store usually? is 10-30 a good decision for an oil weight?i know these 
 are really elementary questions, but i have to start somewhere-
 thanks-
 &gt;&gt;

usually the upright VW motor takes a tad under 3 qts.  Which means you should 
buy 4, as you always want to have a quart (or two) handy in the bus just in 
case you need it.  
If you have a deep oil sump you may need 1 or 2 or 3 extra quarts.  For the 
oil filter, the engine takes more oil, so dont forget to check the oil and 
not just think the list people say that 3 quarts is good.   If you have a 
filter, purchase an extra quart of oil and fill the filter before you install 
it or it will drink up half a quart or so of oil.  

 the thing is you will have to take the number off the filter you have on 
there and get another. 

Do take the little round pan off the underside of the engine , and wipe it 
clean , make a not of any thing you find on that sump plate in your little 
record book you keep in the bus. I call that a tea leaf reading.  Myself I 
drain the oil into a clean drain pan so I can see what settles to the bottom 
- helps predict the future for the engine.  Does the oil smell burnt?  like 
gas?  uniform consistancy, or are there thin and thicker bits?  Get a new 
gasket set for the oil change (usually it costs abnout a buck).

what weight?  depends on you climate.   Here in the PNW I am using 30 wt in 
winter, probably 10/30 would be fine here too.  It wont get above 50*F much 
for the next 5 months here.  If you live where it is warmer, maybe you want 
20/50.

It is a good idea to keep up on the oil changes.  Oil is cheap, and regular 
oil changes and valves adjustments are crucial.  Can stick masking tape with 
&quot;Oil change due at: xx,xxx miles  &quot; on the dash.
