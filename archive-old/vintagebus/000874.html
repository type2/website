&lt;&lt;Perhaps a spare steering column, or spare motor,&gt;&gt;

A couple friends of mine from New York regularly travel with a complete
turn-key engine in the back of their Westy.  Good thing too, 'cause we had
occasion to use it once when they threw a rod on hwy 40 just outside of
Knoxville a few years ago.
