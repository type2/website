Gabriel's does excellent work.  At one time he had a huge supply of NOS
lock related components.  He went to lots of shows and performed feats of
lock magic while customers looked on as their cars were repaired on the
spot.
I have seen some posts from him for requests for lock parts...and can only
suppose that his inventory is shrinking or gone???????
He has done work for me and I couldn't be happier.
Here's his info:
Gabriel's
1725 Long Barn Way
Stockton, CA    95207
209-475-0868
Good luck
later
