You probaly will still have to get a bonded title, that way you will get to
use the stamped vin in the vehical, The birth cert really proves nothing
being that you might not have the original engine and if it does the  MVD
(that's what it's called in AZ.) still probbally won't buy it and if they do
they will issue a new vin number . A bonded title is easy, cost 50 dollars
and is a done deal, Go to the PO and get a notorized bill of sale (hopefully
it's a arizona title) go to MVD, get the paperwork, go get your bond (at
your insurance company) go back to MVD and get your title.

if you have any other questions p+mail me or call me

Wow! You just made my day! I'm so glad I thought of this too! I was going to
get a bonded title, or whatever the dmv wanted... But I think you solved my
dilema! Wooo! So just show the dmv the birth certificate and explain the
problem? Is there a quicker way to prove that the title # is the engine
number? I thought I heard that recieving the letter from Germany takes a bit
of time... Thank you!!!!!!!
