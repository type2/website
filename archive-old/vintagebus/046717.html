Its definately a double cab because of the popout latches....but a 58 would 
be a binz which wouldnt use a cargo door handle like that.
I believe 1960 used the later cargo door handle.....
So a 1959 doublecab.
One of the safari latches looks wrong too, ......

&gt; OK gurus, by looking at the picture, name the model and year.
My guess is:

58,59 or 60 double cab with a deluxe ashtray.

take care,
