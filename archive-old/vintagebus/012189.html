&gt; I have also conveted all of my bus stearing collumns over to use a

&gt; a few lock units, but none have tumblers that are any good.  Anyone have
&gt; a source fopr these? I inquired a few years ago, but no go as of yet.

My '59 bug had a factory stEEring colmn lock, and that didn't
seem to slow them down either.
