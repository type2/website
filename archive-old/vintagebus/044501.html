 &lt;&lt; FYI, that manual is dated Jan., 1954 so maybe a 54-55 thing? &gt;&gt;
 Hi Everett,
 Our 1959 parts manual shows it as:
 111 129 703  Manifold - Induction with heat intensifying jacket up to engine 
 No. 20 - 695 355 (Jan54!)
 So this would be a 53 model year part not a 54 or 55 or used up from when to 
 the end of 1953 for VWs intended for Northern climates?  Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;


there was the 111 129 701 regular 25hp intake manifold as well as the 111 129 
703 version.   The picture in question shows an early --36hp-- intake 
manifold, which, afaik, was standard on all early 36hp vws- it is shown in a 
bug owners manual I have as well.  actually saw and handled one once (we re 
not worthy) and it was 36hp.

what is M 178?--speed limiter for 36hp?   there was already an E version of 
the intake in 1958.  wow. that is six versions.
