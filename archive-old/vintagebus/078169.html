Subject: Re: [VB] Flipseat westies

Actually flipseat westies were made from a swivel seat based bus. If you
check the m codes on one you will have a m199 code which uses the small side
gusset which was needed so the drivers seat (also moved closer to
the center) could turn 360 degrees. A walkthru bus had bulkhead surrounding
each seat.
