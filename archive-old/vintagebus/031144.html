Jay-
I too live in WI, as you know, and bought a 62 bus this time last year. 
  I drove it about 10,000 miles last year.  That was from mid-June until 
about mid-September.  That included a couple trips over to Sheboygan, a 
trip to Missouri (Misery that weekend -- 105 degrees) and other drives 
all around WI.  The times I didn't drive it were when I needed to repair 
things (of course).  The bus needed a couple things when I got it, and 
thats about all I had to fix.  Well, I did do new rear brakes, but thats 
about a 2hr job sitting in the driveway.  It was VERY reliable.  It 
always started up and putted right along.

I drove a Vanagon today at work, and it reminded me how nice those 
waterpumpers are to drive.  Well, an 81 wouldn't be water cooled, but 
its a Van a gone none the less.  Personal preference really.  If you're 
going to get a split, drive the beast.  Live on the edge -- instead of 
taking Sunday drives, how about driving it to work, or going to a drive 
in movie, or out for ice cream, etc etc.  Its sad to see them sit.

I did basically a top end rebuild on the engine over the winter and just 
replaced the tranny/engine mounts this past week and put the trans back 
in a couple days ago.  The engine will go in Saturday FOR SURE as I have 
the day off.  I can carry it over to Sunday if so desired.  After that, 
I will be driving it daily once again.

I've been driving my 71 bus daily for the past couple months now and 
just do little things to it here and there.  I recently added a DBG 
sticker to the back window.  Damn I'm cool.

Anyways, enough rambling.  Time to go get that engine ready to be 
carried out of the basement.

&gt; Is a split window bus a reliable daily driver...say between about 1963 -
&gt; 1967? I have a chance to buy a 1981 deluxe camper ($2000) that needs a
&gt; tranny ($1500 new w/clutch if needed), and I like it but what I really want
&gt; is a split window camper. However, I live in Wisconsin and would I be
&gt; happier with the later model bus in the long run (it has a working gas
&gt; heater)? I hope this email does not annoy the other listees and is an
&gt; appropriate post. I guess I want to hear the selling points of the split
&gt; window vs. anything later and why you drive a split. Finally, would it make
&gt; the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
&gt; split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).
