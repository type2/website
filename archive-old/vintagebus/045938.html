 This Bus (model #215 - VW delivery van, double doors left and right sides,
 LHD) was produced at Hannover in June of 1959, it's port of entry into the
 USA was Houston, it was initially registered to a Texas business as a
 delivery truck, and then to a private individual for a few more years.  It
 came from the factory with &quot;M&quot; codes 175 (Bumper guards - export markets)
 and 360 (anybody know what this one is?).  Since then it has been parked in 
&gt;&gt;
= = = = 
seems like they are a package for US specs- used 59, 60?, and they had the 
175 as well to round off the bumpers as they didn't change the M code to 
include that till a few years after the bumpers were dif euro to N AM spec.

I would use glycerin (available for cheap at you local drugstore) on the real 
vinyl leatherette seats.   It helps soften the material.  Bring back the 
supple ness and softness.   doesn't fix the seams coming apart though.   It 
has helped original seat material for me, prevent cracks.  good for floor 
mats too.  
sounds like a great bus.  I like the old original paint low milage buses.   :)
