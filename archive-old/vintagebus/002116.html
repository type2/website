A Local blaster in Greensboro uses plastic media on paint when possible ,
but he restores  t-models  as well as other things so he knows old metal, He
also does glass beading , uses walnut shells , and aluminum oxide.he said
sand is best and neccesary for rust, i;m sure he would enlighten you on it
if you asked , he also deals in POR products too.
If you want contact him via phone tell him Kelly aka Metwiz  told you to
call , he'll give you the straight up in my opinion.

 And BTW ,, this weekly $issing contest on different subjects is getting
rather old . Maybe Thom can set aside 1 day a week for this manly art. (that
was a joke).
Personally i get digest so i can skim the subjects and skip the ones i'm not
intrested in, later
