&gt;  If you have all new seals you will more then likely break a German latch
&gt; also if you use to much force, that's why the OG ones broke 
&gt; in the first
&gt; place.

ever had someone new to splitties in your bus who trys to open the vent window w/o pressing the button?   That could be why some of them break.
