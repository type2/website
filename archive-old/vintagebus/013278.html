I have a radiator suggestion that is tried and true.  I have been running a Subie in my 63 Double for 3-1/2 years.  For the first 6 months, I fussed with borderline overheating, and finally came up with the perfect setup.

I originally built a rear decklid, 1&quot; box tubing frame and sheet metal, hinging from the side with 3 stock hinges, to fit the contours of the truck.  I started with the little Subie radiator, which wasn't enough for the job.  My current setup is a big 3 core V6 radiator mounted in the decklid, with 2 12&quot; thermostat controlled fans, sucking air thru the radiator and out the back of the truck.

For the Turbo Subie engine that I am installing soon, I realized I woud need more, because of the superheated water.  I added a Honda Civic radiator midship, between the front and rear wheels, flush between frame rails, protected by a expanded metal grill.  This addidtion, with the 11 feet of tubing, (additional capacity) more than covers cooling.

My truck takes about 25 minutes to reach 180 degrees, before the fans kick on.  With the 2 radiators it has never been over 182 on the gage.

None of this ( the whole project) involved any cutting on the double Cab.
