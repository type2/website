Subject: Re: Fitting my bus in my garage

hmmm.... if you are talkin about one inch... DEFINATELY just air down! 
nothing will be easier than that. you wont do any harm at the 1 mph you will 
pull it in at. my house i bought in January, built in 1898, has the original 
barn in back and the opening is about 4 or 5 inches too short. i have a 
really crusty set of 14&quot; rims im gonna put the bus on and drive it into the 
barn for the winter. if thats still not enough, ill just shag around the 
block a few times to grind 'em down until i fit :-) i gotta take the 
rack/ladder off too. yea, its gonna be a pain!
