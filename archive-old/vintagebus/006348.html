Terry Wolfe has taught me the best place for a set of speakers up front.
You take 2 surface mount speakers and put the upside down on each end of the
parcel tray.  This is a dead space area that even us big fatties don't use
or creep into.  I still have to install my sound system in the bus but this
is going to work wonderfully well.  Terry installed his speakers in the same
place and not only does it sound good, it's extremely non-invasive.  You
forget that the speakers are even there.  Terry always supplies our
campsites with period correct music with this setup. :-)
