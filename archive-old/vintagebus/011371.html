Subject: Re: 67 chassis number

&gt; From: Darin Nelson &lt;darin.nelson_at_attws_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Subject: 67 chassis number

&gt; I acquired a 67 bus (well, the title says 66, but everthing else
&gt; looks 67).  Anyway, the chassis number (on the fresh air vent and
&gt; in the engine bay) says it's number 257076396.  I have yet to
&gt; find a book where this number range even exists.

The third digit, '7', means it's a 1967 model.  The sequential
number 076396 means it is the 76,396th 1967 bus made.  Judging by
that number, it was made late December 1966 or early January
1967.  If you look at the production plate behind the right hand
seat and pass it along, I can give you more specific information.

You're looking in the wrong books.
