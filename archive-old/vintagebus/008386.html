&gt;So what does the lock plate look like..
&gt;
I slapped a pic of the lock plates in my Gallery, here ya go:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/htmlscript/gallery.mv?search+lock%20plates

It's from the shop manual.  (hint, hint)

Note there are 2 lock plates, the top plate goes over the bottom plate and
the little bracket for the brake line.  The picture shows the plates in the
unlocked position.  The ones on my '60 Truck are locked/bent over on the
side toward the rear of the vehicle.

Note the brake line bracket is on the top most bolt also, it was erroneously
reported a few weeks ago that the bracket goes on the bottom.

Regards,
Everett
