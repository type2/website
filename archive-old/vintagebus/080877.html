&gt; Hi Volks- I have a type1 1776 that has run wonderfully all season. Went
&gt; out today and changed carbs (all nuts and bolts accounted for) and
&gt; ignition wires. Went to start the bus and heard a horrible knocking

hope it isn't what happened to me, somehow dropped a washer down the
intake without realizing it.   got sucked into a cyl and I had to drop the
engine and pull the head to get it out....not a happy camper..

 fortunately in my case it was more noise than damage


good luck.

Bob
