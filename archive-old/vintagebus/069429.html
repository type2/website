&gt; &gt;&gt; What size fuse should these H4 have 25amp?

&gt; &gt;divide the wattage by 12 to get the current of the lamp.  Add the
&gt; &gt;currents of the lamps in the ciruit.  Double that to get the fuse
&gt; &gt;value, and then use the next higher standard value.
&gt;
&gt; A 50% &quot;derating&quot; seems like a lot.  This formula would say to use a
&gt; 35 A fuse for 2 100 W lights.  35 A in a 10 gauge (4 mm^2) wire is
&gt; pushing the limits for that size of wire, at least according to
&gt; Bosch / DIN VDE 0298 part 4.  According to the National Electrical
&gt; Code (for AC wiring, which is admittedly a different beast), 10
&gt; gauge wire is limited to 30 A overcurrent protection.

30 is pretty close to 35!

The NEC is designed for wires being loaded continuously to their maximum
current by being hooked up to several different devices.

The headlight circuit is a dedicated wire, so the fuse is really there
only to guard against a short circuit.  A short will put a very large
current through the wire so you can use a relatively large fuse.
