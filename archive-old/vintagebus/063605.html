you can get the front coupler repro.  I had to do that for my 61, which uses 
the two screw front coupler.  The repro wasn't the greatest - the ID was off 
(WW) but works. less that $10 I think.

As heat/cooler shock treatments didn't work, I Used a grinder to slice the 
old coupler longwise.   or was it around the middle?  It's in the archives a 
few years back- wear eye and ear protection, cut he old coupler off, when off 
its easy to removethe other bits and replace the shift bushings.  DO NOT mess 
up the shift sticks- they can be a PITA to find.  I can't belive that E&amp;B cut 
that nose off that bus for me to get the rear shift linkage out, but as 
theirs was bad they really needed it to do the gear shift.

&gt; I'm in the process of prepping my '59 single cab for me to weld in a 
&gt; home-made front mount so I can use the later splitbus transaxle.
&gt; 
&gt; Learning from my old '59 Kombi, I decided to pull the shiftrod and 
&gt; make sure everything was good there. It turns out it's  stuck pretty 
&gt; good.
&gt; 
&gt; So I started out at the front shiftrod coupler. I tried to remove the 
&gt; 2 set screws and both broke off at the heads. This is the metal 
&gt; coupler up kinda underneath the cab of the truck. I guess the best 
&gt; plan now is to drill out the broken set screws. But then, it's real 
&gt; possible the coupler will be welded to the shiftrod pieces by rust!!!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering if any of these parts are available repro. The front 
&gt; shift rod. The front solid metal shiftrod coupler. The rear long 
&gt; shift rod section.
&gt; 
&gt; If they are available, or if I can find good used...it might make 
&gt; more sense for me to just cut these apart and get 'em out rather than 
&gt; messing around with them for days only to end up with something I 
&gt; can't use in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?
