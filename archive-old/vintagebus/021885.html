Subject: RE: [VB] ... a real 1835?

&gt;I have never actually met a person that has built an 1835, &lt;
Neither have I.  There are very good reasons that the 1776 is more popular
than the 1835.  Read all the Berg, Hoover, and Fisher stuff to find out why.
I think even Muir advises against it, granted it is one of the &quot;new&quot;
sections in the back which really are not written by him.  The 1776 vs 1835
is the same as the 1586 vs 1641 argument. 

&gt;I would very much like to run an external oil cooler w/ thermostat just for
the added protection if it gets a little spicy. &lt;
Overkill.  This is very easy to add later so I would save the cash for beer
until you knew that there was an overheat problem.  With a properly built
1776 you will not need an oil cooler.  1904 I would though.

&gt;along with a full set of gauges&lt;
Whenever you run an external cooler be sure to add a cylinder head temp
gauge to that list.  You should only need tach(optional), oil press, oil
temp, and cylinder temp, anything else is just a light show.  You can have
cool oil, but the engine load could fry the heads and you would never know
it.  

You may want to consider the type 4 motor swap.  Also I have heard that the
Kubbleschmidt (sp) P&amp;C setup works well, but I have never seen one.  I think
this will give you an indestructible 1700 or 1800....  If my next motor was
not a 1800 type 4 swap I would try this setup.  You may also want to
consider the 1904 which gives you the same thick walled cylinders and more
CCs, granted everything would be custom at this point.  Dave Easterwood is
collecting parts for a 1904 so you may want to talk to him about how to do
it right, Dave is an incredible engine builder.  He also only builds
40HPers, 1586, 1776, and 1904 motors.

PS:  I anyone is in the southeast, preferably Georgia, area and have some
junk type 4 stuff laying around I will be more than happy to dispose of it
for you ;)  Thanks.

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. To raise a war chest, income taxes - once reserved for the rich -
were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
