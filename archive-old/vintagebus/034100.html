I got another phone call from TMI today, they have approved all colors on
all of there new bus upholstery, I am being FED EX samples of all fabrics,
patterns and colors of what is available (will be in my possession by 10 am
Thursday). I personally have seat covers made in the Platinum for the 66/67
buses and am receiving the approved samples of Como Green, Mesh gray,
Salt-n-Pepper and also a Mesh
Red (type3) but would look cool in a non original bus if reds your thing.
I am looking forward to receiving these and they will be included in my new
Online Catalog (Grand Opening March 18). For further information please call
or email.
