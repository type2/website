Went to the OCTO meet Sunday, and the weather held out for us. Kudos to
Charlie Hamill and the rest of the OCTO crew for another excellent meet,
must have been near 150 splits. I don't know where else you can see so many
barndoors, highroofs, ambulances, and firetrucks in one place. The buses
there come in all colors, not just grey primer!!!

Finally hooked up with listee Robert Davis who has donated an engine for
this years Jerome Raffle Bus. Matt &amp; Katie, also listees, dropped by for
awhile. They have donated their 60 Kombi to be this years raffle bus.
Between the cab floors I got in the auction at Havasu and a rocker I picked
up in the swaps at the OCTO meet, this bus is going to be ready to go in
primer in a couple of weeks. We'll drag it to the ABC's Corona de Tucson
campout in March so people can see it, and I expect we'll pull it to the
OCTO and the VW Classic in June, hopefully painted!!! Should be a beauty.

Oh yeah, the Westfailure grenaded a steer tire at 85 mph on the way home.
E-ticket ride!!! Just throw a piece of coal on the seat and watch me make a
diamond!!!! Stats for the trip were 750 miles roundtrip in 12 hours and 15
minutes on the road, including 2 hours downtime finding a tire in Palm
Springs on Sunday afternoon. 15 miles per gallon average. Yeah, I know it
isn't a VW engine, but I wouldn't be making the OCTO meets if it were,
either. Have to be to work Monday, you know.

Thanks to all of the vendors and listees who have donated to the ABC raffle
bus and thanks to the guys from OCTO for a great time.
