Hi Paul,
The best thing to do in a nut shell is to look up the tire size for your year
bus in your year and type Bentley manual or Official VW manual.  Then take
this info to a local tire dealer who will work with you, to figure out what
size that would convert to in todays radial metric size tires.  Ask them for
a stiff sidewall in these new tires (Unless you enjoy getting blown side to
side by wind and/or semi-trucks passing you on the highways.) in either P for
passenger or LT for light truck tires.  Expect to pay about $70.00+ for
quality that will last 60,000-80,000+ miles instead of the 30,000 mile cheapo
whimpy tires that are about half the price of quality tires.  If your old
radials (Never mix bias and radials!) are not completely gone then get only a
pair of new tires and try them out on the rear.  Then if you like how they
ride get the rest of them replaced.  Make sure to ask the shops you call that
they have the large five lug pattern adapter so they can balance your tires.
Plus either only take in the wheels you want to have new tires put on, or if
you have take the VW in to make sure the shop does not over tighten the lugs.
 All too often to CYA themselfs they way overtorque the tires on you car to
avoid any possible loosening.  This means that they damage the rims and you
will most likely will not be able to remove a flat tire when needed some dark
and rainy night.  So unless they are going to hire a fellow to follow you
around constantly with the same tool they torqued them on for you.  Make sure
they only tighten the lug bolts to the stock 80-85 Ft. Lbs. not the 300-600
Ft. Lbs. that they will most likely do.  Eric&amp;Barb
