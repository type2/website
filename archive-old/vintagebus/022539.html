Anyone have a 14&quot; rim for sale for our '65 Westy? Two would even be better,
our spare is bent, and i want to take an extra spare for our trip to
Newfoundland. We are going to run the 225-85R-14LT tires, 28.7&quot; diameter.
Any of you math wiz's out there that can tell you our rpm at 60mph?
thanks, Jim
