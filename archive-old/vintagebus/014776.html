&gt; Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious what the engine ended up costing you.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, this fall I will be flying to Las Vegas with a
&gt; possible side trip
&gt; to just north of Reno.
&gt; 

Lester,
I spent $1250 for the engine and another 65$ for
shipping. I did have delivery of the engine the very
next day !!! Wow, called Ronnie on a Monday afternoon
and the engine was delivered to my door the very next
afternoon. 

Should you find your way up here to the Reno area,
call and we can get a couple of the local guys
together. 
Where is it north of Reno are you headed to?

Chuck Notmeyer
Reno
