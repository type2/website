Subject: RE: [VB] shocking 53 bus
Mime-Version: 1.0

Clara spake:
&gt;the lever shock is attached to the bus with two big bolts.  an arm goes
over to the RGBox and attached to a thingy that bolts through the spring
plate.
installation should be the reverse of removalbut getting to the top big bolt
is a real PITA.   very inaccessable.
&gt;
I undid mine by removing the wheel and going at it from over the top of the
spring plate with Mr. box wrench.

Don't forget the lock plate!  ;)

That reminds me that I stil need to find/repro the little curvy plates that
go from the lever shock arm to the redux box special bolt.  Hmmm, I wonder
what it feels like to drive with rear shocks hooked up.

Did you know there's a lock plate for lower front shock mount too?  Most of
those seem to have been broken off...
