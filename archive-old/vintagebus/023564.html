I know what it is.
Fixed ambulance bus side step.
Has a little peddle that you push and it &quot;retracts&quot; out from under the bus.
Also optional for standards, deluxes, westys, whatever.
Am I insane thinking I was going to find one for around 200$ is very nice 
condition?
I thought that was the &quot;going&quot; rate.
Please someone let me know if I am dreaming.....
I may have to reconsider.....

&gt; Early Ambulance side step. OK Condition. Call 8am-3pm or weekends. Or
&gt; Email anytime.
&gt;  
&gt; Damn and you guys think Im a price gouger!?
&gt; Ive wanted a step like this, have been offered them in the last few months
&gt; for around 150$.

Before everybody lynches this guy.It might be the style step that
moves in  when you close the cargo doors and out when you open them.
Ambulance only step!!!
Much much more elaborate than a normal step.
not sure if it's worth $800 but worth quite a bit!!
