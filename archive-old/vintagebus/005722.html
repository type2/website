    I totally agree w/ eric &amp; barb... go for it NQ!
    Other things to look at include the spigot bores (think that's what it
is...) where the cylinders fit into the case. If someone has driven the bus
with really loose heads, the cylinders could have wiggled around &amp; mangled
that a bit. another operation that i don't have the tools for...
    Also the bores for the oil pressure relief and control valves... if they
are worn they may need to be refaced. Maybe it was M. West that was talking
about that...? ...in regards to weird oil pressure.
    If there is a ridge detectable with your fingernail on the main bearing
saddles... bore time or case-replace time. Pay attention to the wear
patterns and their location on the bearings that you remove.
    You can balance your own rods &amp; pistons at home... even then, the whole
operating system could be way out of balance. I have yet to track down a
place in Knoxville where I can have a good race balance done. Race places
are all over Nashville, though.
    'spose until i have the full-on race balance done, I'm missing the
forest for the trees.

later...

&gt;Hi NQ,
&gt;We whole heartedly agree with Thom.  You can do a far better job yourself,
&gt;learning up close, and personal what really goes into rebuilding an engine.
&gt;Plus you can take the time to do things so much better than any shop would
&gt;do.  Like balancing, all the moving parts, installing a CW crank, making
sure
&gt;all of the cooling fins are clear of casting flash, making sure the CR is
&gt;equal, low enough, installing a full flow fiter system, type 4 cooler, and
&gt;much, much more.  About the only parts you can not do without really
special
&gt;tools are to rebuild the heads, bore the engine case, rebuild the rods, and
&gt;regrind the crank/cam.
