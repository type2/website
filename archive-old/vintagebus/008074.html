Well I've got the ball rolling with my shop project that I've been talking
about.  I've decided on building the maximum size the city will allow me - a
30 x 40 shop.  The total cost for the concrete and completed structure (no
electrical, no insulation) which is a pole shed type of construction will be
really close to $5000 so that is what I was able to borrow because I have
such a high credit rating.  I guess if you do good with previous loans, you
get a rating and the credit bureau then gives their blessing on lower
interest loan.  Like my loan officer said,  &quot;It pays to have good credit.&quot;

I'm in a position with my job to get things at a discount.  I've secured the
free services of a contractor who will bore my holes for me in the ground
with a bobcat and hydraulic auger.  I also talked to one of my favourite
contractors and he said that he not only would give me advice with building
this thing, but he would help me as well because as he put it, &quot;I love
building those things.&quot;

Anyway, one of the first things I want to do is run a pipe undergroud out to
the shop so that I can run an RJ45 cable in the house.  I can surf the net,
do email, and the main thing - put up a webcam that sends an updated photo
every few minutes so you can see me work, getting pissed off, picking my
nose, welding, building stuff, dancing around naked in the shop, and all
number of voyeur activites. :-)

I'm pleased as punch that I'm finally gonna get a shop.  I've got a busy
spring ahead of me but once this thing is built, I want people to feel free
to come on down to Beatrice and have free use of the air compressor and
related tools, welder, sandblaster, etc.  I have so much stuff I want to
build and repair that I know I'll be living out there for a good portion of
my life and I would sure like to share that with others.  I'm not going to
offer my &quot;services&quot; until I get my stuff done but maybe in the future,
Lassley Automotive will be a reality.

I've got lots of red tape to jump through with the city so they're my next
big hurdle.  Wish me luck.

I'd like to hear feedback from any of you on the webcam idea.  Matter of
fact, I would be willing to trade parts for any old beater Pentiums that are
166Mhz or higher with which to run out there.  I have a hunch that I'd be
one of the more popular stops on the web site parade.  Imagine seeing me get
pissed and throw something and then a few mintues later see one of my
crybaby posts to the list.  You could live the frustration with me.

All fer now and maybe for list traffic sake, we should limit the webcam idea
to private email unless Thom (vintagebus) or the vintagvw crowd deems it
listworthy.
