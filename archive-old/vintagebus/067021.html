Subject: VW Trend Confusing quote addendum

Uh, wait a minute. Either I am just misunderstanding what the writer is
saying, or he is absolutely dead wrong.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but
the advance port of the vac can is on the OUTSIDE of the can, and the port on
the BACK side of the vac can, closet to the dizzy body is the retard. Right?!
Am I confused? Or is there a guy driving around out there right now with his
vac lines reversed because of WRONG advice from a magazine writer?!?!?

Peace, John Baker
