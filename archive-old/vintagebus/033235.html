 &lt;&lt;  I got a new oil pump to see if that would help my lack of oil pressure.  
   While installing it, getting the gears in and backing plate on seemed 
awful 
   tough.  Just less clearance than the old one so it would make sense to 
have 
   a tighter fit I thought. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Chet,
 Remove the oil pump cover and put a straight edge across the pump and then 
 measure with a feeler gauge to see if there is at least .004 clearance.  If 
 not you need to take a piece of glass for a flat surface and sandpaper to 
 remove enough of the rear faces of the gears to provide the proper 
 clearances.   Then fix your starter problem!   Eric&amp;Barb

...I once had a similar thing, where the gears seemed a little too fat , when 
the cover was on the engine didn't want to turn freely.   turned out that the 
pump gear with the thing sticking out to mesh with the cam was sticking out 
too far and the cover had no clearance, I just tapped that in a tad and it 
worked perfectly
