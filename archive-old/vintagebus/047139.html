&lt;&lt; Also, I have two B*g swingaxles complete hub to hub, if we hunted down bus 
axles &amp; redux boxes, is it possible to install em on that trans?  &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
That will work.  The bus uses a type 1 transaxle case with different gearing 
and a R&amp;P flip to the other side to keep the four forward gears instead of 
four gears in reverse.  You do not need to install the upper axle just the 
tubes.  Then install the lower axles and thier bearings.  Eric&amp;Barb
