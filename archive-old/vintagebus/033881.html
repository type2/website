Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Front Striker plates?

the 66 striker plates are the same as 65's.  3 screws to 66 2 screws for 67

The 66 door WILL work with 67 plates if you are putting the doors on a 67.
I had to put a 67 door on my 66 and its fine.  I tried to put the plate on 
but found out about them being different.

I did take the rubber bumper thingy off th plae and put on the 66 plate.

The only difference between the doors are the locks (67 has the double edged 
keys)
