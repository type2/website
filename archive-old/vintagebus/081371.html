Subject: 30/31 flooding 

Well, I finally found out what's causing the 1600sp to start like its 
flooded when warm.  The reason...it is flooded!

Gas is leaking out of the cast gas discharge tube and down the carb( not its 
official name) when the fuel bowl is full.  I discovered this when I pulled 
the carb and removed the top.  I filled the bowl with gas to check the float 
level, only to find that gas would just stream out and down the throat.

OK now that I know whats wrong, how do I fix it.  Someone mentioned a check 
valve somewhere, but I could not find any.  I've blown air in and out of 
every passage I could find.

Any suggestions?  I'd like to not buy a new carb.

Thanks.

Steve
