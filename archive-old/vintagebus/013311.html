   Actually this conversion can be done and maintain a stock appearance. My
61 single cab has a 4.5L Rover aluminum V8/auto trans nestled between the
frame rails coupled to an 8&quot; Ford rear end. None of the engine components
stick out of, or above the bed and the tires tuck nicely inside the uncut
fender wells. You can't, at a glance tell it from a stocker, untill you
turn the key.

&gt; Thanks for all the replies, but since I only paid $500 for this bus I
&gt; don't feel too bad about cutting it up.  I've actually already done a
little
&gt; welding and cutting on the wheel wells and around where the engine will
sit.

&gt; 
&gt; I guess i'm now committed to finishing this thing off.  Whenever I get
time
&gt; I'll post some pics so you all can see the progress.  Thanks, and keep
all
&gt; the great help coming!!!
