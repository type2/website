Subject: Dizzy gear and crank timing???

I have YAQ (yet another question.)

The VW rebuild book says that the dizzy rotor should be pointing towards the
mark on the dizzy housing while the 2 dots on the crank gear are pointing
down towards the bottom of the case seam.  When I did this, the rod for #1
appeared to not be at TDC and had me confused.  The rod was actually 90
degrees off.  I had assumed that you wanted the #1 rod all the way out of
the case and then set the gear by this since you would be really close to
TDC.  My brother said, &quot;Well remember the timing with the 009 is about 30
degrees BTDC.  My rod was about 90 degrees off (or close to that BTDC.)
Maybe if anything, this is a ball park way of getting the rotor to align up
with the crank properly and then any fine tuning of the timing is done after
the engine is assembled?

Good lord - I hope I don't have to split the case again.  Someone confirm
that I did this right...please!
