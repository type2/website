        Jabber-Jabber List
              by Screwloose Feral

  'Twas Frydaye, and upon the List
    Were Minds of fetid thoughts so bent,
  Toward Topics of the rankest Grist,
    That admins cringe, but Rules relent.

  &quot;Beware the Jabber-Jabber List!
    &quot;Of emails flowing without end!
  &quot;Of Subjects Rust and Heat and Tires,
    &quot;That like the seasons come again!&quot;

  He paused his fingers o'er the keys,
    In thought he lingered, half asleep ...
  Then slow and painful typed the words
    As came they bubbling from the deep.

  And from the keyboard, one by one,
    The clicking noise disturbed the Night,
  Drove out the Silence of the Lateness,
    Sounded like a cricket fight.

  Vee, Hay! Enn, Hay! Gee, Oh, Enn!
    The keyboard groaned beneath his strokes!
  Til grabbed he mouse and with one click,
    A message sent to email folkes.

  &quot;And art thou finished yet, My Love?&quot;
     Said Wife while filing on a nail;
  &quot;About damned Time! Then go to bed!&quot;
     But said Computer: You Have Mail.

  'Twas Frydaye, and upon the List
    Were Minds of fetid thoughts so bent,
  Toward Topics of the rankest Grist,
    That admins cringe, but Rules relent.
