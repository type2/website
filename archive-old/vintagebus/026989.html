I have been running the Rancho 3.88 r&amp;p in my 64 Westy for a year and a half.I
have a 1600 sp with a header,195x70/15's and thats about it.This bus stays
pretty full most of time and sometimes with my rack.I have been averaging 20
to 23 mpg. most of my driving is on the highways around Chicago going fast
(65-70) ,but I also drive downtown Chicago on a weekly basis.However,I have
experienced an increase in gas mileage after installing a comp-u-fire ignition
three years ago.
    But I do feel the downside to this gearing is traveling up long steep
grades!! It defetinely is a strain on the motor unless you install a bigger
engine.But, for me, there isn't a steep grade for hours around here! ( my
opinions after 18,000 miles running a 3.88 rp).

&gt; I'd like to add my experience FWIW to the 'Speed vs RPM' thread.

&gt; I've been running a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th, Big Nut tranny with 195/75 14 LT
&gt; tires and a 1776 dp/30 pict-1/stock exhaust for some time in my '66 westy
&gt; and the best mileage I can get is 16, maybe 19 with a tailwind on a trip.
&gt; My daily commute to work yields 13-16 mpg at a steady 60 mph. I've tried
&gt; different jets, carbs, distributors, checking for tight bearings, dragging
&gt; brakes, etc. to see if I could push a little more from this combo with no
&gt; success.



&gt; When I changed
&gt; gearing, that's when the bottom fell out on my gas mileage. I think I'll
&gt; chock this up to experience, and I'm going back to stock gearing or at
&gt; least a 4.12 R&amp;P very soon.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has any suggestions or can point out something I may have
&gt; overlooked, I'm all ears.
