I'm in the process of installing carpet pad in my 66.  I'm using 1/2&quot; pad and
double face tape (both freebies from work).  So far, I haven't had any
problems with the installation.  I have used 3 layers on the roof as a trial
to see if it would hold (the double face).  It seems to do the trick.  I got
the idea after using a double layer on the floor and engine areas and really
noticed a reduction in noise.
