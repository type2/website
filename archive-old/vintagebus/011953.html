&gt;I'm wondering what this feels like. I've started to notice something like
a shudder when I shut the bus off. It's in the second after the key is
turned off. I have no clue what this is, but I don't think it's normal in
any way. My mind's eye says to think a!
bout that flywheel, but I kinda don't think that's it. Don't feel anything
abnormal with the bus running.

&lt;
Joe,
        I just had to tighten the big bolt up that keeps my squirrel cage
tight on my generator, though I thought is was keyed in place.  It made a
goofy sound every time I turned off the engine.
