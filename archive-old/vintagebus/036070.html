Subject: Re: [VB] Upper door jamb replacement
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Rocky,
The areas most needing to be replaced and thusly those who make replacement 
panels for are in an area from the bottom of the jack points to about 1' 
(about 30cm) above the jack points.  This runs throughout the bus 
horizontally and is caused by 90-95% of the normal occuring rust in any bus.  
So any areas especially above the belt line are only going to be availible 
from wrecked buses or NOS sheet metal.
