Subject: Re: New Engine Purchase!

	If you had the choice between a 1776 and 1915 engine for your
bus which one would you choose. It will be a daily driver and will be
running hills back and for to work with one grade in the middle. I have
a 1600dp now but the case is cracked and I don't have time right now to
build one so I am thinking of purchasing one from BAP in Arizona. The
engines are made of all new parts except for the rods are reconditioned.



Thanks in advance,
