Subject: Re: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

Markus-
When you thighten up the jam nut watch the inner nut. you maybe tighening
that one too, as they will both turn as you tighen the jam nut and take out
the tang on the locking washer between the nuts. Also tighening the jam nut
takes away some of the slop even if the nut does not turn. As a diesel
mechanic of 22 years+ I have had this happen on many ocassions when your
lock tab is part of the washer and made out of thin metal. You could take a
1 1/4&quot; wrench (a good quality one) and thin it out, grind it to clear (while
grinding it keep cooling it so not to change the hardness) and maybe a bend
or two (after bending w/ heat, reheat the bent areas and quench wrench in
oil till cool. Old motor oil is fine. Puts the temper back into the metal)
for holding the inner nut while tightening the jam nut. It sounds to me like
you inadvertantly are tightening the inner nut causeing bearing failure.
Also use hi temp disc brake wheel bearing grease.
