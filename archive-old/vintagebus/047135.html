&lt;&lt; k Heres the deal. I got another motor for cheap $$$ and I want to fix it
 and use it for a spare... The problem with it is that the Gland Nut (as
 usual... second time I found this) was not tightened enough and it backed
 out &gt;&gt;
I'm afraid even though JB Weld is wonderful stuff, it's not very good at
filling wallowed crank shaft holes.  You probably should hit the machine shop.
The first thing I'd check is that the flywheel didn't mess up the rear thrust
bearing, before heading for the machine shop.  I wonder though if they can
drill 4 new holes with the crank in the case?  I've always just bit the bullet
and spent the 22 bucks for a new crank.  The flywheel and starter alignment
should be no biggie as your just rotating the flywheel 90 degrees.  The main
thing is to make darn sure your threads in the end of the crank for the gland
nut are okay, and as you probably will have to do anyway....score a new gland
nut.
   Peace, Love, and JB Weld-a friend to Solex carburetors everywhere,
