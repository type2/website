Another tool, so to speak that I find to be really handy to have...the
output shaft cut out of an old tranny.  It centers a clutch disc like no
other!
Got to have a BIG floor jack from Harbor freight too!  Get a couple of em!
And one last thing...buy a good set of taps and dies (metric of course).
And use them on all your nuts, bolts and case openings religously!
later
