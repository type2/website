I located a shop in Blair, Nebraska that does reciprocating balancing of the
VW assembly.  They want the flywheel, rods (no bearings), pistons (didn't
say if they needed the rings or not - do I?), and the clutch assembly.  The
gland nut, dowels, etc. were mentioned as well.  It's about 130 miles one
way and I'm thinking of driving it this Saturday and dropping the parts off.
I'll pick them up later.  For $85 they'll grind and clearance everything
evidently so I'm on the way to a smooth running engine.

In anyone's experience, do the rings have to be included?  The gal didn't
say so I'm assuming no.
