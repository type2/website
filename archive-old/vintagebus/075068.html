  If people aren't anal about having to use German boots (not very many good
ones that last out there, I've tested every brand here in the desert) EMPI
makes the best split boot out there. For those that don't know EMPI's core
business is making cv boots. They make them for most major car companies and
auto parts store chains. We have been testing them for over a year now and
have not had one go bad or even look like it is.

ps. we have tested PM brand, Bilstein/Febi, Meyle and Meisterstatz all
German brands with the Meisterstatz being the best and the Bilstein/Febi
being the worse in our HOT AZ conditions. We do sell what is available (in
German) but do add the warning on longevity.

Been driving the truck a bunch since all my &quot;new&quot; cars have decided to
let me down all at once and the only thing that's reliable is the 40+
year old double cab.  Last night I finally got around to adjusting the
brakes and replacing the right side axle boot on the 62 (with 67?
tranny), and I had a few questions.

Does one boot usually go bad before the other?  One was cracking and
leaking and the other looks almost new.  I replaced them both two years
ago when putting this bus back in service.


The PO told me that a '67 tranny had been swapped in for the original
box right before I bought it.  When changing the right side boot I
noticed the part number was a 113 number.  Do bus tranny center sections
have a bug part number or is this a bug tranny center section???

Thanks.

Steve
