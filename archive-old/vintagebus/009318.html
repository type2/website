Subject: needed governor cover and the big red light

Hi all,
Took Terrapin (65 21 window) on our first trip this Weekend to Paddy's Wagens
250 miles round trip.  She ran hot and upon closer inspection of the bone
stock 1500 engine It was pointed out to me that I am getting vacuum leaks from
the governor because the cover is missing.  I was also told gas could
theoretically come out one of these holes and start a fire.  Something I do
not want so....

Does anyone have a cover for a governor that would fit this engine that they
would like to part with.  I plan on parking her until I get this fixed...

Also anyone know what the big round red lens above the windshield wiper pull
switch is for.  I looked in my 65 owner's manual and it is not in the picture,
but it is definitely on my dash and on some (but not all) splits I have seen.
TIA
