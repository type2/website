&gt; Conversation starter?? Are you serious, like your bus isn't interesting 
&gt; enough and you don't have anyone else to talk to anyways? I hate it when 
&gt; these wierdos come up and start talking about when they had one and how they 
hehe,

fortunately enough i am a wierdo, so meeting my own kind isnt too big a
deal.  I will admit though that since i've been driving a split i went
from 3 people coming up to talk to me about 71 a year to 3 people
commenting on my 61 a week.  I dunno if i like the extra attention, im
kind of a keep to myself guy, but i have definitely noticed a difference!

take care,

Steve
