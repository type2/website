Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Run On!

	I just purchased a 1776 Engine a couple of months ago and it has
been running fine. But in the last couple of tanks of gas when I turn
off the engine it wants to keep running. It has been timed and the
valves have been adjusted is it (A) Getting to Hot and need to be cooled
down with additional Air? (I have a Doghouse fan shroud and oil cooler)
(B) Bad gas and shouldn't go to Shell I have tried 87 and 89 Octane Gas
or (C) My dual baby Dells need to be Sync again? Please help if anyone
has solved this problem which I would think would have had to of
happened to at least a couple on this list at one time or another. Oh
and one other thing new wires and plugs and I have an electronic
ignition (Pertronix) with a new cap and rotor.


Thank You for your reply
