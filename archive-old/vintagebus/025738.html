&gt;that would seem to be the way to go.

It is indeed much cheaper, and requires no re-working, but a stock MC for a
61 does not have the dual-circuit feature.

Even as hard-core a 'Vintage Nazi' as i am, i still believe the update to a
'71 style MC is a very wise decision.

My Westy still doesn't have one, and with that froze-up e-brake handle of mine,
i feel like i'm taking my life into my own hands every time i step on the brakes!


Lesson Learned the hard way:
One time while driving my old '21 window home from work, i had a rear wheel
cylinder blow out.  I was comming up on a red light at a pretty good clip, and
to make matters worse, the intersection was a double-jobber, with one light
stopping traffic for *2* cross-streets!

Stepped on teh pedal, and it immediately went straight to teh floor.  &quot;oh Shit&quot;
was about all i had time to think to myself before all hell broke loose.
I made it throught the fisrt cross street OK ( going between 2 cars as they
passed each other, just like in the movies).  As i came up on the 2nd cross
street though, traffic was already moving along by then.  I missed the cars
coming at me from the port side, and to avoid t-boning a car comming ffrom the
starboard, i had to whip the bus sharply to the left, nearly flipping it over.
 I was then coasting along side a guy in a Toyota with a VERY startled look
on his face. i was going the wrong way down the street though.

Luckily all the traffic had already passed, and no one was comming at me.  After
all the traffic to the right had passed by, i finally came to a stop when i
rammed into a huge pile of snow that had been plowed up on the side of the street.


The bus nearly tipped over from that too, and was listing so hard to the port,
that when i opened to door to get out, i *fell* out of the side!

It all happened so fast i didn't even have time to shit my pants!  and of course,
after it was all over i remembered i should have turned off the engine and put
it in low gear!  DOH!

After pacing around on the side walk absolutely SPAZZING out for a few minutes,
i pushed the bus out of the snow with the help of a bum who then asked me for
a dollar so he could get some Church's Fried Chicken. (translation: cigarettes).
 After a moderate amout of freak-out time, i fianllay composed myself enough
to figure out what had happened.  I put a pair of vice grips on the hose to
the wheel that had blown, and VERY CAREFULLY drove the rest of the way home.
 Then i had to fix it that night, on ice, in wet, St. Louis winter 10 degree
weather so i could drive to work the next day since the Scirocco (the 'reliable
car' as my mom called it, because it was *new*) was broken down as usual.

Morale of the story: get a dual-circuit MC ASAP. And if not always keep a spare
pair of clean underwear in your bus.
