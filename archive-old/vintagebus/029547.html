&gt;Alan Shofield has complete cargo floor halves available, and
according to their latest catalog, pickup beds as well.  Their
new cat also shows a RHD cargo floor; I'm hoping against hope
that I can get one of those, at which point a set of LHD
cargo floors will be on the market.
&gt;
Someone once told me the front floor of their Barndoor (LHD) had been completely
recreated out of pieces of Ghia pan halves.  It looked correct to my untrained-at-that-time
eyes.

Something to look into?
