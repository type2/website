Subject: Re: [VB] pulley leak

&gt; I think the real key is the part that says air can enter the
&gt; crankcase. The crankcase is sort of a pulsing between vacuum and
&gt; overpressure as the pistons move up and down. If air is sucked in
&gt; through a valve cover leak on a vacuum pulse, there is more air in the
&gt; crankcase on a pressure pulse, and by the gas law more gas is more
&gt; pressure, forcing oil out anywhere it can get out.

If you think about it every increase in volume due to piston movement is
countered by an equal and opposite motion in an opposing piston.
This, plus the fact that it is occurring at high frequencies makes me
doubt this explaination.
I do agree that the valve cover leak must be increasing the crankcase
pressure if it is increasing leaks from the draft tube and slinger but Im
struggling to understand why.
