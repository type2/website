Subject: TMI Upholstery Below Cost

Someone ordered rear seat and center seat (w/folding back) upholstery for
his splitty and then cancelled the order, leaving me stuck with them. These
are in white smooth leatherette, and are brand new in the TMI boxes.

Our discounted price on these was $220.  (TMI retail is about $300.)  I will
sell them for $135 plus shipping, which is way below cost, just to cut my
losses.  You could order matching front seat upholstery at our regular
discounted price if you were so inclined.

Please email me directly if interested.

Thanks,
- Ron Salmon
