Subject: Re: [VB] RPM/ Gearing??

Hi Richard,
First thing is to get rid of the 165R15 tires.  They are most likely  to only 
be rated for about 1200 Lbs..  You really need at least 1525  Lbs weight 
rated tires to prevent blow outs and problems of being blown about at  highway 
speeds, by semi truck and side winds.
  We suggest you install not only the later RGBs, but also the front  
suspension.  20% bigger brakes is a great thing to have if you really want  to do 
speed like you are planning to do!
  You should be able to get all of this for less than a different  R&amp;P.
Eric&amp;Barb
