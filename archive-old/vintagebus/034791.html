&lt;&lt; Hi! I'm confused. Other than the pan that goes under the cab area and 
 covers the pedals, is there another kind of pan for under my bus?
  &gt;&gt;

generally the term splash pans refers to the pans at each corner of the rear 
bumper between the bumper and the corners of the bus.

The under pedal pan - what is it called- now I am confused, some people call 
it a belley pan, but that term was already  taken by the double doors and 
sunroof buses for the extra pans welded under the floor of the cargo area.
