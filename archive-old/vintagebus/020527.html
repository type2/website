The Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project has moved once more to its new
home:

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

The home.cwru_dot_edu page is still kicking, but the doc project isn't there.  It's
stored entirely on altasta_dot_net.  I guess nobody will visit my lame site
anymore ;-)

Thanks very much to Dave Raistrick (who you all know as the type2_dot_com sysadmin)
and Atlasta_dot_net for giving us space for the project!  The tar.gz and PDF files
will all be online eventually, right now most of them are up but not all.

And there's the addition of a new manual to report.  This is the VW Local 
Manufacture of Workshop Equipment book.  You can find this on the site :-)
The manual was loaned to the project by Alex Kuchta, scanned by me (slowly), 
and the HTML was written and the images made suitable for even (patient)
dialup users by Matt Roberds without sacrificing usability.

I just completed the changeover about five minutes ago, so there may be 
errors and broken things.  If so, please email me describing where you found
the problem so I can fix my mistake.

MUCH THANKS to Thom Fitzpatrick for hosting the project for us when NBCi
(without so much as a &quot;bye now!&quot;) pulled the plug on it.

Bus content: I drive my '67 Westy daily, with its custom Pavement Monitoring
System (PMS) installed in the front floor.  Betcha can't find that one in
any of the parts manuals!
