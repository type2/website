Subject: '61 Single Cab FOR SALE

Greetings all.

I am selling my '61 Single Cab.  I no longer find it practical to keep.  I
am located in east Tennessee.  The truck is located in Georgia where it was
awaiting paint. I haven't brought it home yet.

Here are the particulars:

-'61 Single Cab
- Gull Grey  (L361)
- 92,000 original miles
- 40hp engine completely rebuilt and repainted back to factory specs by Jake
Raby of Raby's Air Cooled Technology of Cleveland, GA (cost of about
$2000.00)
- new brakes, lines, wheel cylinders, master cylinder
- new wiring harness
- Gas tank cleaned and sealed
- new wood bed strips (white oak) from Robert Davis of California. These are
still in the box
- extra windshield glass
- extra bumpers
- new painted hubcaps (still in box) plus chrome hubcaps
-Original key   (all locks work)
- truck came from Louisiana
- it was purchased new by an old crop duster down there.  he was in his 90's
when I got the truck
- it has always been kept inside
- It was produced on February 17 of 1961 and left Germany on February 21
1961.  It was delivered to New Orleans
- gates are good
- treasure chest solid (not a double door)
- minor rust on bed seam in middle of bed
- I have two grooved repair panels to repair this small amount of rust
- solid floors
- straight nose
- everything works including the dome light inside the cab
- good transmission
- some dents on passenger's side on and around treasure chest door

I had a guy who said he would take it, but I haven't heard from him.  I'm
asking $5500.00 or reasonable offer.   Yes, I realize this sounds a little
high.  I'm hoping to weed out the tire kickers and receive only serious
inquiries.  I need to sell it before winter.  If it remains here through the
winter, I may end up keeping it and I DON'T WANT TO KEEP IT.   I have some
photos that I can scan and e-mail to SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.  I want it to
go to a good home.

E-mail me privately if you are interested and have more questions.

Thanks,
Victor
