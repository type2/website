&lt;&lt; Hi all, I bought a new front wheel cylinder last week and installed it
 this weekend, but the hard line going into the cylinder is leaking. It
 looks like the nut is bottomed out on the cylinder, but the line still
 seems to be a little loose. Is the hole drilled a little deeper on the
 new cylinders, or do I have a problem with my hard line being buggered
 up?
...................................
I've never had this issue replacing cylinders, so the last time I got a new 
one they weren't deeper.   I would take the metal line out and make sure all 
the threads are clean so you know it isn't the last threads being clogged up 
stopping it threading in. and that the crimped end is still good.   I had that go 
bad on the fuel line into the fuel pump on my 53, which was oozing gas as the 
tight nut didn't hold the metal in place tightly.   So I had to replace that 
metal line.   

Normally one replaces all wheel cylinders on the axle if one is bad, as the 
other ones tend to go bad soon.   same wth brake shoes, the idea being that you 
don't want uneven braking etc.  At least take the pistons out and clean them 
up/inspect for rust pitting and make sure the seals are good.   Ya, I know the 
57s have the expensive front brake cylinders, but you need brakes.

also check that the end of the metal line is clean and unrusted, no cracks.   
If bad, take it off and get your local brake shop to make a new one. (cheap) 
when I did this I ended up with 12mm install of 11mm nuts at the ends, but no 
big deal.  It came straight, and I used the old one as a template and 
carefully bent the new one into shape with vice grips with rags under them (don't 
squash metal tube)  i grease the threads on the metal line nut so I can undo it 
next time.   And the line where the nut spins at the end, as it can stick on 
there, meaning using penetrating spray and careful wiggling back and forth to 
undo the line w/o twisting the end off.

 This is on a '57 kombi with stock hardware.
 
 Also, I'm trying to replace the clutch cable, and I can't seem to get
 it the list 1.5ft or so, seems it's hanging up on the bowden tube. I
 tried to remove the tube, but it seems the mount on the tranny is part
 of the side plate. Will the tube slide out of the mount with a little
 force? Or any other ideas on how to get that thing installed?
 
 Thanks!!

Yes you have to use a good amount of force to take the bowden tube out/ 
install it.     Sometimes I can get the new cable in w/o messing with the bowden 
tube, but only sometimes. It's a PITA.   I always grease up the ends when 
installing so they are easier to remove next time.  And make sure you grease up the 
new cable as you install it.  Grease is good.   Grease the threads where the 
stars for brake adjustment turn into the thingy, and where the thingy turns in 
the holder that is attached to the backing plate for ease of future brake 
adjustment. grease grease grease.  make sure the springy clips are there, and 
spring against the stars so they don't self unadjust.
