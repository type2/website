Subject: Re: [VB] New Seat Covers

Nah.  Just get some of that waxy undercoating the Brits spray all over
the bottom of their cars.  I forget the name, but it is basically a
sprayable wax.  A light coat should work fine.  Sprayable cosmoline or
something like it should work too.

Steve

The name is Waxoil made by Finnegans I believe.
