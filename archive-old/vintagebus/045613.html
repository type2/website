Hi Scott,
If your head temp gauge is VDO you can get senders at any shop that sells VDO 
stuff.  From what we have heard the senders that fit under the sparkplugs get 
damaged by the removal/installation of the plugs over and over.  When we 
install the two gauges we have in our buses we will probably mount the 
senders with a large washer under the nut on the upper heat exchanger 
mounting stud to the head for # 3 cylinder.  Eric&amp;Barb
