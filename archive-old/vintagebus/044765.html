&lt;&lt; i just noticed recently that my headlight switch tnes to get awful hot 
when i
 have my headlights on. It takes about 10-15 minutes to get to this state. The
 part that is hot is the metal, i gues the plastic know stays or acts as an
 insulator.
 
 Is this normal, or does it indicate an electrical problem?
  &gt;&gt;
indicates corrosion inside the switch.  I am sure VeeWee will tell you how to 
take the switch apart, solder the appropriate bits, reassemble, and that this 
will make the switch not heat up, and brighter lights to boot.

I need to do this to my 53.  The headlight switch heats up  :(    Made me 
concerned about the possibility of an electrical meltdown.
