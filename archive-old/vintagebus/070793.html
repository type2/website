Some of you may or may not know that I am in the process of converting
my 58
panel into a mobile espresso van.  It will make it's debut at the
Volksfest in
Naches, WA September 13th.  What I need from the list is this, I need 4
names
for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW related, they do not
have
to be all bus related.  The 4 lucky winners will each get a pound of
fresh
roasted coffee with their blend name.  Thanks all, come see me at
Volksfest in
September!!!!
