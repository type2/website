Subject: Re: [VB] 6V vs 12V
References: &lt;009801c07b89$dbd550a0$15361c3f_at_oemcomputer&gt;

my point of view is as follows....
My 62 bus (http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/62.htm) was converted to 12V many
years ago by the previous owners (had a shop do it actually).  I really do like
the 12V...it lets me run nice things like a tape deck and radio and hook up to
other cars for a jumpstart if I were to need one some day... it also allows me
to run a 6V starter at mach 3.  I like this... starts much faster...and has more
cranking power on cold days...even though I really don't need it i guess...bus
is stored winters.... if the starter burns out...so what?  5 minutes and a spare
starter later...I'm on the road again.  no biggie.  I'm building a beefier
engine for the bus and also installing big nut reduction boxes and a little bit
taller tires for better highway speeds....therefore I wanted the 200mm clutch
for a more solid power transfer.  I still wanted to spin the starter over real
quick...and did not want to grind the bellhousing on the original tranny.  I
don't know why...I just didn't want to do it.  so...i went with the 6V 200mm
flywheel ... I found one already actually!
I don't think that 6V parts are really harder to come across...its just that
they are different.  I just run a voltage drop for the wiper motor so that is
still 6V...and the original radio is unhooked so that someone doesn't turn it on
by accident i guess.  I've a tape deck in my parcel tray...so that doesn't
bother me.  I guess its really up to the owner...  12V is nice (I like my H4
halogen headlights... I think they are available in 6V too?) but its not
necessary.  6V is original to some buses... but its your bus, right?
