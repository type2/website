Subject: RE: [VB] more on Safari Window latches

  Wolfgang has also switched over to OG style latchs (wide base) on all
their new Safari front windows. IZZY is not making Safaris for a couple more
months I was told.

Correct me if i am wrong, but arn't CE and Izzy using
a base that looks like the OG base?  (Not a cut down
wing window)  

If anyone is interested, i have safari window bases
available.  They are one piece, triple chromed all
steel bases that are exact to OG bases.  Both Left and
Right side.  These will not break.  I have used them
on my buses for years and have many other satisfied
users.  (I supply one of the larger parts houses for
there customers who need replacments for OG windows) 
They are not cheap, but they are correct and will give
years of service.  If anyone is interested, let me
know.  I can also assemble them for you if needed.

Matthew
