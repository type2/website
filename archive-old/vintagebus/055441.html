&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt;    As an Sinful alternative to the Busses and Ballons Show, there is that 
&gt; show in Las Vegas this coming weekend.
&gt; 
&gt;    I've never been, but am thinking about gambling....er, I mean, going.
&gt; 
&gt;    Anyone have opinions about the show?

I've heard the LV show is no good. I've also heard that the Busses and 
Balloons show is way more fun.
You can gamble at our Indian casino's and loose your money just like LV.
I really don't know anything about the LV show I'm just trying to get you to 
come to Busses and Balloons V.
We have a 3/4 bus roof rack and a brand new beetle wood slat rack as main 
raffle prizes. I bet LV doesn't have that.

Busses and Balloons V October 5, 6 2001  Mucho fun for the whole family
