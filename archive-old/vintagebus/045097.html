Subject: Re:  [VB] Masking Nose and Beltline
To: mizamook_at_sonic_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

When I painted my 65 I had the same question.  And just tape it as the bottom 
of the beltline in the corner of the curve.  If you look at original paint 
buses you can see that line wobble.  (Depending on whether Hans had too much 
the night before?)  I think Nellie's belt line is as straight if not 
straighter than when new.    Used that thini flexy blue tape which can go 
roound corners.

Hi!


I am asking anyone who has painted their two-tone buses for advice on how to

effectively and efficiently mask the nose and beltline.  On the nose:  How

is it possible to get that very complex and delicate curve right?  I have

just spent an hour and a half just applying the 1/4&quot; Thinline tape to the

nose in 3&quot; to 6&quot; lengths to allow for corrections.  Once I get the line

right, I'll overlap with 1/2&quot; tape and then begin the paper.  Are there any

tricks or tips?


On the beltline:  Do I mask just to the lower edge of the perimeter bulge,

or do I cover over the groove underneath to start the lower color just at

the top of the panel?


Photos are more than welcome if you've got 'em...


Rain and temperature allowing, I'll have the lower part done by the end of

Wednesday.


Thanks,


Gene Cornelius
