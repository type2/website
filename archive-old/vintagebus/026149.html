&gt; Now the question is how much engine do you have crammed into your splitty? 

I run a '61 with a 1600 DP with hemi cut heads _at_ 6.9:1 CR,
1.25: rockers, Zenith 32NDIX 2-barrel carb with isolated
runner intake, straight megaphone exhaust, '67 3.88 R&amp;P
tranny w/ 30x9.5 mudders and a balljoint frontend,.

The throttle is set so that with the pedal on the floor the
butterfly is wide open.

Tops out about 80mph _at_3800 rpm if I remember the numbers
right;&gt;)

I've read most of the replies. If you will remember, with
the large nut tranny came the 1500 engine. Do you really
think the 1600 is THAT much more powerful?  To double the
speed of an object takes four times (4x) the work. The HP
gain from the 1500 to the 1600 was just not that great to
think your going to overpower your largenut split.

Its your ride; believe whatever floats your boat.
