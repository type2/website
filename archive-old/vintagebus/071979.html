&gt; IT IS TIME FOR A BUS . I am not sure what to look for when buying one any 
&gt; info would be a big help .Are rocker arms and floor pans hard to do ? I am 
&gt; going to look at a 61 micro tonight .

Hi SkillWill,
Well rocker arms on the bus are in the same place as on bugs, inside the 
valve covers.  Floor pans are harder cause there is no such thing in buses.  
The floor, walls and roof are all welded together in what is called a 
unibody, so one has to replace floor sections into the body.  Best thing is 
to hit the VW show and swaps for an eye full of what buses are out there.  
Some are alot more common than others.  It took us four years to find our 
SO-34 Westie camper!
Good Luck,
Eric&amp;Barb
