I did the same thing, paid Troy and never recieved a
thing.  Last I heard was they folded but never had the
kindness to refund money or even just plain send
anyone a notice.  Its that DAMN SOTO syndrome.  (That
David Heard 'prick' still owes me $20 form `94!!)

Troy (GASS editor/owner) still puts on a show in July.
 I hit him up for a refund then...he played dumb and
let me swap for free to somewhat make up for the
subscription.  I guess a half assed attempt at a
refund is bettter then nothing.  If I were you I would
give him a call and harass him.  You probably won't
get anything, but being a PIA to him gives some bit of
satisfaction.

Too bad...he had a decent mag at one time.

&gt; I always liked the mag; remember them sending a
&gt; postcard bemoaning some
&gt; tension within the org, hope they didn't fold.
&gt; And no, I haven't had time to dig an old issue outta
&gt; the closet and phone em!
