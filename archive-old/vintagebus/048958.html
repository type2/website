I can't remember if there was ever a thread on this, but I previously searched the archives and couldn't find diddly.

Early commerical bus interior front cab door handles.  By early, I guess I mean pre '62.  Since I've never owned a barndoor, I'm lost there.  Anyway, my '60 Single Cab came to me with chrome ribbed door handles.  Very similar to early Type 1 door handles, but seem to be slightly different.  Something about the shape of the curve I think.  I also grabbed a set of these off of a '58 Kombi in a salvage yard not too long ago.  Question is, are these correct?  If so, what years were they correct?  I looked on the backside of the handle and it appears to have a &quot;225&quot; stamped in it.  No other part number that I can find.

Who has the light that can shed it on these?  TIA.

Robert
