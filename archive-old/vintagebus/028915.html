&gt; Has anyone ever tried mounting an antenna on the undercarriage of a bus?  I've been lead to believe that Mercedes and a few other auto makers in earlier times did this on occasion, primarily due to cosmetic reasons.  I've also been told that reception is compromised that much, if at all.

Robert,
You're AM reception would most likely be just ok but not great.  Any kind of shielding will reduce reception.  Cement on the bottom and metal on the top with small open slots for the signal to reach the antenna.

Now on FM, this is VHF and line of sight type of reception.  Polarization of the antenna is also important.  FM radio stations vertically polarize their signals so that the car antennas (vertical) have the best reception.

One of the tricks that is used to search out a nearby weak transmitter (ham radio), is to rotate the receiving antenna.  In many cases, just rotating it 90 degrees is enough for the signal to dissapear completely.

Bottom line is that if you spend your time listening to 50KW AM stations, and local FM stations, you should not have much trouble.  Go out on the road, I doubt you'll get much.

Now if you happen live up in the Santa Barbara area, the horizontal antenna won't work at all due to local regulations governing the polarization of radio transmitters.  Only vertically polarized antennas are allowed to operate up there.  They are trying to help the vertically challenged.
(that last paragraph was just a joke for Robert's sake)
