Subject: Re: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

&gt; I might have simply misunderstood your last post. I
&gt; was talking about
&gt; the Beetlemex style of doing it. It IS on an old
&gt; chassis, that's where
&gt; the vin the dmv looks at is, right on the tunnel. I
&gt; guess the guys you
&gt; are talking about actually had a real mexican beetle
&gt; &amp; actually lied
&gt; about what the vin on the frame was? is this right?

They didn't lie about the chassis number; they stamped
the old number on a new pan!
