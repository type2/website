Well, it's not far from Sacramento.
It has large grassy lawns for vehicles,
much more than Kelly Park.
Several parking lots.
Areas under trees for swapping.
Camping for those so inclined.
Very close to where I live.
Fishing lake too!

The Nevada County Fairgrounds in Grass Valley
is only about 30 miles east of Sacratomato.
Hod rodders, steam engines, county fair, Celts,
draft horses, and even bluegrass musicians use it.
No reason a very very nice venue shouldn't be used
for vintage VW's too.

Not much in real information, no photos, but it's something.

It just takes someone willing to step forward and do it.

Just not me, I'm too busy to even own a beater,
non-running, yard ornament bus.

I wonder if there's any place in the Sacramento area where you could do
something
like that.  Sac Raceway sucks for having shows; it's hot, dirty, and LOUD.
The drag racing noise really wears you down.

They
&gt; are having problems with the city / KPbeauracracy re having the place for
a
&gt; car show.  They also think it is a great place for a show (on the glass,
&gt; rather than a hot parkig lot,  occasional shade trees, victorian
buildings)
&gt; But the show is too big for everyone to drive in now.  SO will they move
to
&gt; another, larger,concrete place?  Or limit who can drive in?   What
criteria
&gt; for who can drive in?  25 years or older ?    show/swap only?   (but why
&gt; shove the Daily driver people out?)
