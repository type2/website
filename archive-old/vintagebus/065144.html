Subject: Re: [VB] Fog lights/Utillit

That's 'cause ebay shoppers don't bother to look around.
I remember the 'bugdawg' guy was getting upwards of $150
for Japanese lights  that you could get for $40 or so.
I emailed one bidder about that, and the next thing you know,
I get a reprimand from ebay for 'interfering' with an auction.
