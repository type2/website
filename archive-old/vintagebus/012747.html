Hey now,

I use to have a set of those old-school Aloha racks until time and oxidation
claimed them (rust never sleeps, brah).  I think you still can get repro
Aloha's at any well-stocked surf shop...  I now use a set of &quot;soft&quot; racks
(~$40) being essentially the nylon strap gig Thom mentioned with styro-phoam
tubing for buffering yer stick from the roof.  I like them better because they
hold your boards up tight against the roof and like the boards are readily
removed when in hostile surf territory (VA Beach-where my first set of racks
disappeared...)

na ka la,
