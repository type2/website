Subject: New non broken in engine blew oil out oil filler tube (un connected) while hand turning)

I am in the midst of engine install, got oil in her, and turned by hand.
Dumbass forgot to tighten the pulgs, and threw some oil out filler, during
the 30 some times I turned it to get the oil around. Tightened plugs, still
just a little oil, but not coming out. Is this to be expected until I break
in the rings (hopefully today).
TIA,
AL
