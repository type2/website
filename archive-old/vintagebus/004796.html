Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission - Help me please

&gt;&gt;Is it possible to just pull my motor and pull my transmission and leave my
reduction boxes on my bus? My guess is yes but .... I've only had it out as
a whole unit.  The ol' fella that I bought it from assures me that the
transmission, reduction box bearings, starter etc.. are all good - but he
won't guarantee the solenoid.  He would guarantee the rest though but he
wants more money if it comes with a guarantee.  I also found a guy who will
rebuild my old transmission.
&lt;&lt;

You can't pull the tranny and leave the reduxes on. You have to open the
reduction boxes to get the circlip off to pull the bearings and remove the
boxes from the axle, then remove the axle from the crown gears. You can run
the late tranny, it is just geared a tad taller. 14&quot; rims, 15&quot; rims,
whatever makes you happy. It seems kind of odd that the old fellas assurance
is free but the guarantee costs money. Pretty neat trick, that. Good luck
with it.
