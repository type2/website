Hi All-

Actually I am looking for the measurements of where to locate the little metal &quot;L&quot; bracket that affixes to the front bumper of an early 1965 westfalia. It is hard to in words what I am referring to but if you have an old westy with a factory tent that affixes to yuor bus via couple of aluminum roof mounted brackets you will know what I mean.

Thanks in advance for your replies.

Michael
