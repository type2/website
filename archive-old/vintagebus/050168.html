Subject: Re: 16&quot; rim spoken for


Erin Lassley offered a 16&quot; rim for trade yesterday and he says it was in
high demand. I hate to see one go to waste: I have a 16 in the back yard,
don't know where it came from, can't speak to the runout or hubcab clips. I
think the diameter is actually about 16 1/4&quot;. They're metric inches so
they're bigger maybe. Wide five. Will trade for good karma, you pay
shipping FOB Memphis.

First come first served. It will probably TAKE ME A WHILE to ship it, I
forget stuff and you'll have to nag me, you've been warned. Don't send me
any money til after I keep my end of the deal.
