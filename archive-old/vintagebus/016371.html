Hello everyone, I just replaced all the wheel cylinders and brake hardware
including the shoes but my front passenger side cries out in a high pitched
shrill voice when I brake fairly hard at the end of a stop. I removed the
hub and found some very shiny areas on the new shoes towards the ends of
them. I used a fine bronze brush and brake cleaner on them ( probably a
stupid move) and reassembled everything which worked for a few miles but the
screeching soon returned. Investigation revealed more of the shiny areas on
the shoes in the same locations. I have a '65 standard and I'm using Enduro
brake components. I'm getting tired of pulling the hub off and I'm no great
mechanic.  Any clues as to the solution. I kept all the parts &quot;but like
clean.&quot; as per the Muir Bible and the shoes are properly adjusted.     Jim
