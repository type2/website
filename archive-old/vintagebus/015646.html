hey,
i postedd this yesterday in response to a post by NQ. i dont think it went 
through. he said as he cruised the lumber yard people were &quot;staring and 
waving like he was in a parade&quot;.

now, i have only seen two split busses in Cleveland, Ohio ever and i realize 
people dont see them too often. but, when im cruisin around people STOP DEAD 
in their tracks and their mouths drop open. some point, some wave. everyone 
smiles. i feel like im driving Chitty Chitty Ban Bang or something. what 
amazes me most are the little kids (under 12 or so) they act like my bus is 
an ice cream truck with Superman at the wheel. they jump, scream, point, 
wave, its hillarious. i know they couldnt have seen a bus before. last year 
i just pulled in to this camp site and jumped out to register, and i hear 
this &quot;BUG VAN... BUG VAN&quot; and i turn around and there is this little kid 
with a HUGE smile on his face. he says hi and i let him jump in the drivers 
seat, definately the highlight of his camping trip. aside from always being 
in to VW busses, now the split variety, this is one of the best reasons for 
me to cruise in my bus.
thanks for reading... was this Friday stuff???
