Subject: 57 singlecab questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,
    I got a chance to go over my truck this Saturday. Its been way too cold 
here in the Chicago area to work in an unheated garage. But I just finally 
had to test fit some parts I picked up over the last few months!, so I braved 
the 30 degree weather.  
    All the vw's I've ever owned were 63+ so I don't know quite how things on 
the early 57's are. But I did look at a 63 singlecab last year and I noticed 
a lot of changes between the two years (adjustable seat! what a luxury).  I 
started going over the truck and I have a few questions that I hope someone 
can answer. 
 
                Does the cab wall have those supports that go behind the seat 
and attach to the floor? 
                Were commercial vehicle's wheels painted black? 
                And does anyone know if those early hubcaps with the lines 
coming out of the logo are repo'd or if someone might have an extra set.

  One thing that I've never noticed before was the angle of the hand break!  
I thought that it got bent to the side in an accident or something, but when 
I looked underneath its supposed to be like that. I ran it through the shift 
pattern and if the brake was straight it would run into it. All the buses 
that I remember having, the handbrake was straight up to the right of the 
boot. This one is almost even with it? When did vw stop doing this? Was this 
some commercial vehicle thing?

PS I am still looking for a 1ftx2ft piece of truck bed (doesn't need to be 
pretty just solid with no dents).
