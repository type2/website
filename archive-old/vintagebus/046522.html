Subject: New 30Pict-1 Floats??
Date: Sat, 4 Jul 1998 12:28:30 -0800

	Does anyone know if you can still get new floats for the 30Pict-1
carbs??  Mine came apart at the seam once before and I glued it back
together with some special glue (I forget what it was), but after 9
months it has decided to let go again.  My local NAPA can't get them and
I'm not close enough to any quality VWFLAPS to drop by and find out.  I
might end up getting another 30Pict-1 at the wrecking yard when I return
from my trip and using it for parts but I'd like to get a new one if
possible. Thanks for any help.
