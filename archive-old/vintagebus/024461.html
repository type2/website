Subject: Bus cover

Hi Volks,

It's getting wet around here (southeast) and I want to get a cover for
my bus since I don't have a garage. Do any of y'all have any
recomendations? I'm hoping to hear that something like the Premium
cover ($100) from RMMW will keep the bus dry. I've gotten good reports
on their Ultimate cover, but it's kind of expensive at $240.00. Anyone
have one by a different company? The cover needs to be able to stand
up to lots of rain and about three or four wet snows per year.


TIA
