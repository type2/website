&lt;&lt; I recently broke the shift coupler on my '66 Westy. I was able to remove 
the
 two halves of the broken coupler pretty easily, the square-headed screws
 came loose with a lot of WD-40 and some gentle coaxing, I didn't want to
 pull the heads off of the screws, so after I removed the lockwires I
 patiently worked them out by soaking and gently twisting with vise-grips.
 
 Now that I'm ready to install the new coupler, I can't get the rear shift
 rod and the inner selector shaft that runs from the transmission far enough
 apart to fit the new coupler in.
 I removed the gear selector and spring but can't get the shift rods any
 further forward as they are bumping against the frame member which holds the
 inner shift rod in place.
  What's the best way to get this new coupler in position?
 I searched the archives and looked in the Type 2 Library and my Bentley
 manual but found no advice.
 I'd appreciate any advice.

why do I think that cganging the couplers in the 66-67 buses (with the later 
front shift bushing) and the splitcase buses is trickier than the 6/59 
through 65s?  Yes put it into 3rd, that helps, but I think you may find 
removing the shift stick in front helps, at least you have to for the split 
case tranny buses (unless you move the tranny back), it gives a little more 
room but not sure if that is how I did it.  It has been a while since I did a 
66/67 but yes it was a hassle.  guess this isn't any practical help at all, 
but how about some moral support?  :)
