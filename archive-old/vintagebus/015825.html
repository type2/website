I undestand that NOS doesn't necessarily mean hermetically,
sterility guaranteed until opened.  I've seen NOS barndoor floor sections
that looked worse than those on running buses.  But the latches in
question had scarring from the screws that held them in the car.
Some items are comepletely useless NOS!  I got an NOS engine lid seal
in a bunch of parts once.  The second I tried to &quot;open&quot; it up, it cracked
and fell apart!  

There's a common misperception that NOS should mean perfect, unblemished
goods.  There's a corresponding misperception that NOS means big $$$
irrespective of condition.  In a lot of case, it's less work to use a
clean used part than to fix an NOS one.  

Also, some NOS items don't work well with a worn bus.  For example, I have
an NOS cargo door that I coulda used on the '55.  But with the 
tweakage in the door frame (common side-scraping) it was easier to fix
the exisitng door than to try and get the new one to match up.

&gt; other age damage.  Some items like rubber and paint from 20-50 years ago only
