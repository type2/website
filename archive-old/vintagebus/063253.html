Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

&gt; What about the dip stick sender that Gene Berg sells.  Anyone have any

I've been using them for years and they do work.   If it bothers you to
use the oil pressure light as a warning, you have to run a separate light.
If your engine runs normal temps they do tell you when you are about 225
degrees.  I used to think Gene Berg was a little crazy in his ranting
about gauges until my oil temp gauge bit me in the *ss.  Gauges/sensors can
change.  The dipstick costs $15 or so, but you have to order at least $50
to do business with them, they don't want to mess with the nickle-dime
stuff.
IF your engine runs too hot, then it's not much use.  My spare engine
started running hot after I put in a 3.88 tranny.  I just pulled the
dipstick wire off since at that point it's just an aggrevation reminding
you the engine is over 225.  The dipstick senders are a good cheap device.
Gauges have their place, but I'll never really believe one unless it's
recently calibrated to at least be close.
I keep check on the Berg senders and so far they have stayed pretty close.
