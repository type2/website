re- the engine pull- get an Idiot book.  Often found cheap at used bookstores
as it has been in print since 1969.  very useful.  cool pictures.   dumb
rambling amusing stories as examples.  get it.   before you get more advice
from the neighbor that may make more work in the future.
.....
PS I thought it was common place that if you changed your bus, you could call
it so. Like the people who like to make there buses into 21's or 23's? 
......

a rose by any other name....  yeas, but for those who care, most of the people
who convert non sunroofs into sunroofs are actually idiots, and putting a
westy kit in a bus doesn't really make it a westy, especially if you are
talking vintage stuff.
