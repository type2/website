Thanks for all the replys!  I forgot to mention some other details, however.  Myself and my local guru went completely through this motor at the end of Aug. after my fuel pump died.  At that point it recieved new cap, rotor, points, condesor, valve adjustment (after the 3years I owned it they were hardly out of spec, one or two weren't!).   Checked on the vacuum advance and it is fine.  However, the thing is, is that I have to go back to school tonight and won't be able to do a compression check until, well, christmas.  Any more suggestians are more than welcome.  

Long live the list!
Benj.
