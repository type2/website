Not many carb woes left for me...  I got the 34PICT-3 to work, but is not tuned correctly yet because the 009 dizzy is not quite timed right for the carb.  Hey it is dark here and the flashlight mechanic can only do so much :)  I will work the kinks out tomorrow or Saturday.

This evening I took the non-working 34PICT-3 off the engine in the bus to examine it more closely on the workbench and compare it to a 30PICT-3 I had sitting on the shelf.  This was a very good idea because I found that the 30 had some richer jets on it than the 34 and so I swapped them over to the 34.  I was kind of baffled in a way because the 30 had a main jet of 112.5 and increased volume in the other two jets, usually you change the main jet first.  112.5 is very small for a 1600 IMHO, granted I ran this carb for 3 years on a '69 bug without a problem!

After putting the 34 under the microscope I was still pretty baffled on why the darn thing would not work.  After removing the carb top I filled the float bowl with water to see if the carb would squirt anything, it did and squirted very well...  Then I started to wonder why the bowl was not full when I opened up the carb.  Hmm, the bowl is dry but the pump works, so I thought the bowl filler valve was faulty.  Took it out and inspected it and then did the ol' blow it out with your mouth trick, worked fine, no problem with that...  Now I was really perplexed, so in my WTF state I picked the carb top up and tried to see through the gas line inlet, couldn't see any daylight at all...  Got a piece of clothes hanger and poked the crud out, all done.  A big glob or red dirt had accumulated in there and would not budge.  I have to commend the dirt because it survived 3 days in the carb cleaner and the roughly 2-3 PSI of fuel pressure.  Put the carb back together and is ready for install.

The 34PICT-3 is set up like this:
125.7 Solex Air Correction Jet
135.0 Minuki Main Jet  ($2.25 at motorcycle shop - they had every combination you can think of too, let me know if anybody needs some)
.965   Solex Pilot Jet 

The 30PICT-3 I set up with the smaller jets like this:
75.7 Solex Air Correction Jet
127.5 Solex Main Jet
.955  Solex Pilot Jet

Needless to say the 112.5 main jet is going to collect dust.

Crank the motor for about five seconds while the fuel bowl is filling and then blaht blaht blaht.  She is a runner again!   I was very happy to say the least, still needs a good tune later though because it still will not idle right.  Also thanks to Matt Roberds 9-pin conversion flasher deal, I now have brake lights and turn signals!  This was another area of mass profanity ;)  The only remaining problem is that the left rear taillight assembly is an early model and is not grounded so no action there, need to find a bay unit to replace with and it should be fine.  Hopefully this weekend I will be able to put a bus back on the road that has been sitting, from what I can tell, since 1984 (last state sticker on the plates that came on it).  Woo Hoo!   Still looks crappy, but should make some events this summer anyway!

Now I know the time length of the list member who always ends in &quot;be on the road in no time&quot;...  No time equals two years for me :)
