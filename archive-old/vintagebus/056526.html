Subject: Re: [VB] Engine install question...

You did not give any info about your engine......

6v starters use a hex head bolt that goes thru the starter thru the trans
bellhousing thru the engine case and you put the nut on by reaching behind the
fan shroud. Horrible system since the head of the bolt turns and you need to
hold it at the same time.
12v starters use a D head bolt that goes in the same as the 6v hex head. A
little better.....it does not turn, but it will push away as you try to start
the nut.


&gt; OK, It's almost in. When I pulled it, my last mechanic only put in 3 of
&gt; the 4 bolts. He left out the one above the clutch. Now I have the motor
&gt; back in place, the two lower studs with nuts on them. How do you get to
&gt; the bolt above the starter? All I feel from the top is a hole, and can't
&gt; get to above the starter from down below.
