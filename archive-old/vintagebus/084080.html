Hello everyone,

Just a reminder that about four weeks from now we will again host 
another B.N.N.T.A. family VW camping event over the long Labor Day 
holiday weekend.  Buses and other VW's will arrive from all over the USA 
at the group campground at the Indian Creek Recreational Area on the 
north shore of Mark Twain Lake which is about 35 miles west of Hanibal, 
MO.  If you'd like more info just go to the simple event site at:  
http://www.bnnta_dot_com   I've leased the entire campground so there will 
be plenty of room and electric hook-ups for everyone!  Access is 
restricted to VW's only, so that when you crawl out of your camper each 
morning all that will greet your senses will be friends and VW's as far 
as you can see!

We hope that you can plan to join us soon!  Drive safe!

Bill &amp; Kathryn Bowman
