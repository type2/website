&gt; Hello!
&gt; 
&gt; This is something I have wondered about, and I know there are those of you
&gt; that will cringe at the thought, but wondering is harmless, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Statement:  I love everything about my in-pieces '67 Kombi except for one
&gt; thing:  That huge window in the rear hatch!
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Will this fit?

No. Different hinges, different width of hatch. You would have to
replace the whole rear body section with the corners.
Please dont.
