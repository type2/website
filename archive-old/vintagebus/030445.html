I had two Transform trannys. I only bought one. The second one came in a
bus I got from a friend. He bought that one, so I knew the history on
it. The one I bought made it 70,000 miles before I got rid of it. It
howled and popped out of second gear for half of those miles. The second
one only went 18,000 miles before it started popping out of fourth gear.
I have replaced it too.

I wouldn't waste any time or money on that tranny. Just keep it full of
oil and start saving for a good one.
