My '67 does the same. I always assumed it was the seal on the cap, as it looks very worn.

&gt; OK - So I am frustrated that everytime I fill up, and I don't mean
&gt; top-off, my tank leaks out the filler cap when I park. The streets in
&gt; Minneapolis are graded pretty steep and it can be kind of embarrassing
&gt; not to mention dangerous with a puddle of gas by the rear tire.
&gt; 
&gt; The obvious is to stop before the pump does, but I'm wondering if a
&gt; different cap might help, or perhaps a different tank, I need to remove
&gt; mine eventually to replace the level sender for the guage.
&gt; 
&gt;  Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
