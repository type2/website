the famous swap panel has been cruising the vw show circuit
for 3 years in it's 2 tone rattle can primer paint job.
the only problem is that it's now 3-4 tone being the new paint
doesn't match the old (imagine that)

ronnie   www.type2parts_dot_com
full catalog web site soon to help in your search for parts
new and used!!!!! (with on line ordering)




There is also available a two part paint from boatingsupply stores that
can be brushed on or sprayed. When cured, it is hard as nails!!!

Cannot remember the brand name. . . comes in many colors. Highly
recommended.

Les
