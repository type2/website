&lt;&lt; In retrospect I am wondering about main bearing #3. To me it *felt* a 
little sloppy and I even questioned it and was assured that it miced within 
spec before installation. What would I know, as I have never seen a dry main 
on a crank in my life. What should it *feel* like?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
About .002&quot; or 2/1000 of an inch clearance between the OD of crank journals 
and ID or the bearings.  In otherwords about the thickness of a head hair of 
those of us with Euro genes (Red heads tend to have slightly thinner hair.) 
and about half the head hair thickness of Asian genes.  First engine we 
completely built turned out the main bearings were one size too big on the 
ID.  This even though the bearings came from a prominent German OE 
manufacture of VW bearings and were vacuum packed to the cardboard with the 
sized printed on this cardboard under the clear plastic!  Resulting in low 
oil pressure especially at low RPMs.   Eric&amp;Barb
