&lt;&lt; Just a quickie:
 
 I'm removing the outer 10&quot; of my cargo floor to prepare for replacement, and
 I'll be POR-15ing (verb?) the rest of the floor after that.  I found a whole
 lotta black plastic screws and washers that seem to be serving a redundant
 purpose:  Holding a floor down that has already been welded in.  What are
 these screws for?
  &gt;&gt;
I am not sure if I can picture this, but would these be the screw in plugs 
for the seat belt mounts when seat belts were not installed?
