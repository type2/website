I've done the bus to bug muffler switch (on my '71, no cutting
required).  I couldn't tell any difference between the bus muffler and
the bug muffler despite the much smaller tailpipe flow area of the bus
muffler.

I now have a nice new bus muffler and tailpipe waiting to be
installed.  Oddly, the Dansk tailpipe is much larger in diameter than
the original bus tailpipe.  I don't know if this is significant.

I don't have the best rear hatch seal in the world, but I've never
smelled a wiff of exhaust in the cabin.  I do smell it when I turn the
heat on with the bus stationary (via the air intakes), but I did with
the bus muffler as well.

One advantage of the bug muffler not yet mentioned is that you are
less likely to ground out the bug exhaust tips then the bus tip while
negotiating rough terrain.  The bus exhaust tip is the lowest point on
the corner of the bus.
