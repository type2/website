Message-ID: &lt;FHCNAOPLFLEBAAAA_at_shared1-mail.whowhere_dot_com&gt;

I wanted to say hello to all on the list. I have just purchased a 63 Delux no sun roof. I'm not new to VW's but new to a 63 bus. I have a 64 Single Cab and a 64 Bug with many others bought and sold. Enough of an intro on me, on to why I came to this list, Pleads of help for questions I have.

1. Will the front wheel cylinders from 64-70 work on my 63 bus. I have found that they are exactly like the ones allready on my bus. They even have the same part # with the exception of a C added to the end.

2. I bought front brake shoes for a 63 and they do not match. Reading in the BBB I found that one drum was 250mm and one was 230mm. It did not state what year was 250 or 230, any one know wich is correct for the 63?

I have looked at the archives and could not find any mention of the above.

Thanks in advance for all help.
