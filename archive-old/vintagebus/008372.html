Subject: 67 bus update for 4-24-00

Got the afternoon off so I was able to get a bunch more stuff done.
Reinstalled the gas pedal and greased the throttle linkage up, greased up
the ebrake ratchet assembly, hooked up the ebrake cables, got a $12 tube of
urethane auto glass sealer and sealed the bottom edge of each of the front
windows (I wanted to stay away from doing the whole thing because if I want
Safari's later on, I want to be able to minimize on the residual leftover
mess), and installed the belly pan.  What a nice surprise that belly pan
was - even though it came from my 1966 bus, it had the extra space to allow
for the dc/mc - I was happy when I found out I didn't need to clearance any
tinwork and just to think, I never knew the difference before.  I checked my
toe-in and I was spot on at 1/8&quot; at the rims.

more later...
