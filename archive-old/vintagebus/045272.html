&lt;&lt; Very rare part:  Left-side sliding door for Splitscreen bus.
 ============================================================
  I don't believe I've ever seen one of these, although I have heard of the 
right-hand version....  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dwokin,
We have seen a couple of double slider door split screens.  One of which we 
found when we lived in an apartment in the city.  A complete DD Euro slider 
panel with no rust, including locking steering.  Only missing tail lights, 
engine, and tranny was bad.  The wrecking yard owner was willing to sell it 
for $300.00, including delivery to anywhere in western Washington as long as 
you paid gas $.  A friend of ours, and us told everyone about it that we 
could, including our local bus club.  No one wanted it, and three months 
later it was crushed!  This was about nine years ago, and still makes us 
sick.   Eric&amp;Barb
