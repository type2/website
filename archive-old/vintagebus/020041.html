Today after I got back from more training for my job as a tire jockey (there
are more ways than I thought to get killed messing with tires) I decided that
while I was dirty, I should get some work on the Westy done.  So I decided to
install the oil filter mount, it should only take 15 minutes.

Getting ready to start I noticed there was no oil.  So I went and bought some.
I'm switching to synthetic now with the filter, so it came up to over $20 for
five quarts.  Jeez.  At this point I felt that I should make the engine totally
oil-leak free ;-)  I'd always had trouble with leaks at the oil filler/
breather.  It's the later dual-port style that doesn't have the tube through
the cooling tin.  It allows oil to pool in there.  My old one had rust holes,
the new one seeped where it mated up to the stand.  I cleaned it off and
applied some permatex sealant to it.  Hopefully that will do it.  Valve cover
1&amp;2 has always leaked no matter what I tried, so I need to get a new cover I
think.  Other than that, no leaks!

After that I installed the filter mount.  I didn't want it up in the rear (FIF)
because a BN4 was going back there eventually and it may get in the way.  I
wanted to mount it in back of the &quot;U&quot; the tranny sits on, but a test fit with
the filter attached showed it wouldn't fit.  So I found an even better spot a
little further forward.  Now that it's installed, it's great!  But it's in a
really awkward position to drill holes and the shape of the mount makes it 
difficult to install the screws.  It took me over an hour but it sits straight
and tightly against the frame.  Also I somehow had the steel-belted rubber line
I bought for it cut to about the right length for that position, so I should
be able to just plug it all in and go tommorrow!

So it was more than fifteen minutes :-)  But I'm really satisfied with the
results.  The filter isn't as accessible as it would be if it were by the 
bumper, but it's in front of the rear wheels so hopefully rocks kicked up won't
be a problem.  The only thing is that I can't get to the filter while I'm doing
something at the engine, I have to slide under the bus from in front of the 
rear wheels.  But it's EZ from there!

If I were to do it again, I would have installed the mount with the tranny out 
of the car, except that I would need to know for sure where it would go first.
It would have been even more difficult if the engine had been installed so I
guess the shifting issues were a blessing in disguise :-)
