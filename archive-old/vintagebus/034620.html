&lt;&lt; I'm trying to replace my shift rod bushing and it isn't going very well.  
So it seems that my bus never had a shift rod bushing for the last 3000 
miles.  I guess if felt sloppy but ..... other than the occasional popping 
outta forth (which hasn't happened in a long time)  it seemed to shift OK.&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Just wait till you have everything in there correctly!  It is going to be 
like the differance between night and day!
 
&lt;&lt;So my 60 standard only has one shift rod bushing right?  And it should be in
 the same way as those in the 63-67 bently pictures - right?&gt;&gt;
If you mean the front shift rod bushing then yes.  There are two on the rear. 
 Be very carefull with that 1960 ONLY front shift rod!
 
&lt;&lt;One of the set screws had already been broken off and I broke off the 
remaining one (from the front coupling) now I'm stuck - I've drilled out the 
pieces of the screws but everything is siezed up.  I heated the coupling and 
tried twisting it with 2 pairs of vice grips and not luck.&gt;&gt;
We had to finally just torch the coupler in half to get things out enough to 
work on them.  Then replaced the coupler with a used one Clara had in what 
was left of another 1960 panel that we had to cut what was left of the front 
to get out the rear shift rod and the forward coupler that were rusted 
together and still took three hours to seperate.  We would suggest slicing 
your coupler lengthwise with a thin grinding disc.  Then insert a slot tip 
screwdriver in the slit and twist the driver to spread slightly the coupler 
open to loosen the coupler and allow in penetrating oil.  Afterward you can 
weld up the coupler and reuse it.
 
 &lt;&lt;So, now Ive sprayed loosen stuff on it and I'll give it some time.  I 
really don't want to cut or grind anything but ...... I may have to.  &gt;&gt;
Yup!  If you do cut either of the shift rods make sure to scribe marks 
especially lengthwise on it so you can weld it back together after making 
adjustment for the thickness of the hacksaw or other cutter used.  BTDT!  
Wish we were a little closer to be able to lend a hand, Eric&amp;Barb
