Sorry Shawn,
Everett beat me to the punch and I had long assumed the same thing that he
said.  We were treated to a long set of &quot;I'm going to get it&quot; messages but I for
one don't remember a single &quot;It's home&quot; or &quot;This is what I've discovered...&quot; or
anything.
I was disapointed and looking forward to hearing further details once you got it
home.  I figured surely it ended up less than you expected and maybe just an
early crew not a barndoor otherwise we would have been reading a set of equally
long series of &quot;just found this out&quot; messages from you.

Not being in the PNW area, you'll have to label me as

Anxiously awaiting the photos

&gt; Sorry you feel that way. The truck is sitting in my back yard as we speak.
&gt; It made it home after about a month of flatbed BS. It hasn't made it into
&gt; the shop yet though due to lack of $$$.
&gt;
&gt; As far as sending you a picture of it, I'll pass at this time. So please go
&gt; ahead and think of it as a lie if you so desire. There has been more than
&gt; one list member in the Seattle / Tacoma area that have seen / sat in it.
&gt;
&gt; Hell two people on the Bay window list wrote messages stating they had seen
&gt; it on the freeway. One said I think they saw it outside of Roseburg, OR, and
&gt; the other one... I can't remember where.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway make it to the Puyallup spring show next year. That will be the first
&gt; time I will drive it to a gathering, and at that point pictures will be
&gt; allowed.
