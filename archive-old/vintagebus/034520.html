Subject: removable cargo floor comment?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

List, two questions:
1. Do you think a removable cargo floor is possible?
2. If you do, any suggestions for materials?

BACKGROUND (skip/optional): 
So, I am also getting ready to put a cargo floor in my 63 deluxe project and 
got to thinking.  Not that it matters much, but the cab divider, rocker 
panels, belly pans, cargo floor, &quot;B&quot; (cab divider) and &quot;C&quot; beams, and all 
control tubes were removed.  Everything has been cleaned, blasted, painted 
and replaced except the belly pans, heat tube and cargo floor.  I bought 
belly pans from Alan Scofield through BBTB ronnie, and plan to put them in. 
They are not beautiful reproductions, but they will do the job.  I also 
reinforced the bottoms of the longitudinal frame beams with 
1-1/2&quot;x1-1/2&quot;x1/8&quot; steel angle welded to the bottom flange and 1-1/2&quot; up the 
side of the beam's web.  This reinforcing runs from the &quot;B&quot; beam to the rear 
torsion bar housing.

CONCEPT:
I will NOT be putting in any passenger seats in the cargo area now or in the 
future, so I don't need the plates or connections.  I do need all the storage 
I can get.  So I was thinking to weld in the regular corrugated steel cargo 
floor from the back up to the &quot;C&quot; beam (which is the most rear full height 
beam and also where the rear jack point occur).  This beam is also where the 
belly pans stop.  Then I was thinking of having some sort of REMOVABLE cargo 
floor.  Envision this:  You lift up the cargo floor, perhaps in sections, 
from the &quot;B&quot; beam back to the &quot;C&quot; beam.  There underneath are the well sealed 
belly pans nicely welded, painted and caulked in place.  Also there is 3 to 6 
inches of storage space.  This storage space would be suitable for things 
that you hardly ever need to get to like spare parts, tow rope, come-along, 
tire chains and the like.  These could be stored in oil or WD-40 dampened 
cloth and plastic bags if needed for preservation and to prevent rattling.  
Granted, it is not the most wide open storage space with the control tubes 
going all over the place like spaghetti.  Also a removable cargo floor would 
allow maintenance access to this nasty area that traditionally collects 
leaves, mice, dirt and rust as well as allowing access to the heat pipe 
insulation and the heat pipe itself if needed.  Now, what about the structure 
that the cargo floor provides?  As far as I can tell, it acts as a diaphragm, 
but the belly pans also act as a diaphragm here.  The cargo floor also acts 
slightly as the top flange of a longitudinal shallow box beam in conjunction 
with the belly pans.  This might be a problem.  However the roof of the bus 
(or in the case of a deluxe, the skylight frames) acts as a much stronger top 
flange to the whole-bus-as-beam concept as it is much farther from the moment 
of inertia.  Okay, have I sold you on this?  Good, now I need suggestions as 
to how to make this removable cargo floor.

PROPOSALS:
The original cargo floor is about 1/2&quot; deep with the corrugations.  I looked 
at hexcell and rolayex composite materials, and these seems to be really too 
fancy.  

I was thinking of putting in corrugated sheet steel, like 28 gauge 9/16&quot; deep 
galvanized form deck used for raised concrete slabs.  I have tried to find 
non-galvanized deck, but it is almost impossible.  As long as I don't have to 
weld it, just mechanically fasten it to the beams, galvanized should be okay. 
 Also 28 gauge would be easy to sort of &quot;roll up&quot; to get to the storage 
space. Like this:

I also thought (okay maybe some folks out there would argue that this has 
nothing to do with the thought process) that some real dense plywood or 
better yet formaldehyde free exterior grade medium density fiberboard or 
strawboard would be nice.  Like this fiberboard:

or strawboard:

Exterior fiberboard would be strong (500,000 psi MOE! WOW), but heavy.  I 
also thought putting down wood, plywood, or fiberboard slates and then gluing 
a rubber mat to them so it could also be &quot;rolled up&quot;.

Opinions and feedback appreciated.
