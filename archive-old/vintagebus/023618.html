&lt;&lt; I don't know for sure , but I thought I have heard similar problems with
 starters when they get too hot.  Could that be the problem?  Good luck. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The only time the starter can get too hot is if the driver just keeps running
the starter longer than 30 seconds at a time.  The misnomer of a hot starter
in the ACVW from running the engine is not possible.  Unlike the normal car
engine lay out where all of the exaust system travels just inches away from
the starter and in this way can heat up the starter and cause it to not
perform as required.  In the case of the ACVW most of the exaust system is
well away and what little coming out of #1 cylinder is insulated from the
starter by the heat exchanger.  Instead this is a sign of starter or
electrical problems when a starter can only start the VW engine when it is
cold and thusly less compression than an engine that is up to operating temp
and thusly has more compression than the starter or electrical system can deal
with.
