&gt;There's a single cab canopy FS on ebay right now, starting bid $750
&gt;http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=227462348
&gt;That seems high to me.  Any thoughts?
&gt;
Sounds reasonable to me as a final price.  Now all I need is a '52 Truck to
put under them, preferably for an additional $750.

The last complete setup I saw was $700, original, used but decent.

A guy was selling NOS hoops for $500 at last years classic.  They needed a
repaint.

I've seen some insane amounts, like the one for $2200 in Hot VWs Feb. 2000.
Isn't that the guy that has like 5 sets of them too?  ;)
