Subject: 67' Westy for sale

Hi list, I just saw this on R.A.M.V.A. I thought someone might be
interested...If interested, please do not contact me, as I know
nothing...

Michael.

I no longer have the time or facilities to maintain my Westy so I am 
putting her up for sale. Here are the particulars.

1967 Westfalia
Good running condition. Was a daily driver up to a year or so ago.
Not 100% stock although most of the stock items are there. 

12 volt electrics and dual circuit brakes, first year for these to be 
stock items.

Some rust in the usual places, floor pan, wheel wells etc. Not bad yet.

Over all she is a nice Westy that would make a fun driver or a good
start 
for a restoration. I am interested in having her bought by someone 
planning on keeping her on the road. 

I have pictures I can email. She is located in Alameda, CA which is in 
the San Francisco east bay.

$2900 OBO
