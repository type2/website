&gt; RTV has no place, and i mean no place on a vw.

that is your opinion and valid, but i have a different one.

I use it all the time, and have good results. It is a useful tool
but you have to know how and when to use it.

*sealing jug bases to case
*hoover bulkhead fitting
*on gaskets prone to leaking i will smear a LIGHT coat on the gasket
itself before assembly. (and i do mean light... take one small dollop and
work it all over the gasket till it looks like it was painted with RTV..
just a thin coat. I use black so its not obvious.  If any squooshes out
when you tighten it down you used too much.)

Well thats all i can think of... and i didnt think of many, but there is
some place for RTV on a veedub in my book. 

take care,

Steve
