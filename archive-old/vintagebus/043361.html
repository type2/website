&gt;Also I noticed on the early 67 that the big black relay has
&gt;a little doohicky mounted at the bottom and connected
&gt;to the relay.  My bus doesn't have that, could that be
&gt;my problem for always having the high beams on.

By &quot;big black relay&quot; do you mean the one that has about
nine terminals coming off of it?  If so, that's the
hazard/turn signal relay and shouldn't have much to
do with your high beams.

The relay you're interested in for the high beams is
a different one, with only about four wires coming off
of it.

For USA-spec Buses up to July 1965 (ie up through
1964 models) the dimmer switch is a simple floor-stomper.
The headlight hot wire goes from the dash switch to
the dimmer switch, and the dimmer connects either the
high or low beam wire to the hot wire.

For USA-spec August '65 through July '66 Buses (1966
models), a relay is used for the switching.  The
relay has five terminals: 

56   hot wire from lighting switch
56a  high beams
F    low beams
30   relay coil +
S    relay coil -

There are only four wires - 56 and 30 are jumped
together with an external wire.

USA-spec August '66 and up Buses (1967 models) also
use a relay, but it has only four terminals:

56   hot wire from lighting switch
56a  high beams
F    low beams
S    relay coil -

There are four wires to this relay and no jumpers.

The 56, 56a, and F (Fernlicht probably) terminals
do the same things as they did on the floor-stomp
switches.  56 is connected to F for low beams or
56a for high beams.

(The Euro versions have an extra hot wire so that
the high beams can be flashed at will, even when
the headlight switch is totally shut off.  You
probably don't have this version.)

The other wires at the relay are notionally to control
the electric foot that stomps on the dimmer for you.
One side of the relay coil has to be powered...this
is done by the external jumper wire on the '66 models and
presumably by an internal jumper on the '67s.  The other
side of this coil (S terminal) is connected to ground
via the turn signal switch.

One thing that isn't clear to me is whether this is
a latching relay or not.  On my Dad's '74 Beetle,
the high beam relay latches - in other words, the
turn signal switch contact is momentary, like a
door bell button.  It looks like the Bus relay may
not be latching, and instead depends on the turn
signal switch to do the latching for it - when
you push, the switch is mechanically kept pushed
in until you push it again.

Anyway.  You probably want to fix your lights.  First,
check for creative PO wiring.  Find the headlight
relay, and pull off the three heaviest wires going
to it...most likely white, yellow, and white/black
stripe.  Don't let any of these touch bare metal in
the Bus.  Turn on the headlight switch, and touch
the connectors for the white/black stripe and yellow
wires together - you should have low beams.  Now
touch the white/black stripe and white wires together -
you should have high beams.  Turn the headlight switch
off, and put the wires back on the relay in the
same places they were.

If the above worked, then your Bus has no creative
wiring on the headlight side of the relay.  If it
didn't, then there is creative wiring or some other
problem.  Assuming it worked, pull off the one
remaining skinny wire at the relay (probably brown).
Turn the headlight switch back on.  Take another
piece of wire and hold one end to bare metal ground.
Touch the other end to the &quot;S&quot; terminal on the
relay (should be the one you just pulled the
wire off of) and the relay should click and your
headlights should change from low to high.  If
this doesn't work, your relay is probably bad.
If it does work, then the wiring between the
&quot;S&quot; terminal and the turn signal switch, or the
switch itself, or the wire from the switch to ground,
could be bad.

I hope this helps!
