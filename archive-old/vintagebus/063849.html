Subject: Bulli Brigade &amp; parts

Ok folks i'm busy as hell and behind thats the reason i'm a bit slow on
e-mails and such , but anyway , i'm trying to justify the time away and the
expenseof the trip. I have 1 set of long bellypans (for the 3rd outrigger
style)both sides and the 2 for the middle, also if wanted i can do some
other small stuff as well. The pans will justify the trip if anyone is
intrested and they can pick up at Bulli Brigade or Mark Rafferty's shop, and
save a few bucks shipping. Let me know asap so i can get my * hit together.
The pans are $450.00 for the full set. or $300.00 for just the 2 side ones,
Also i can modify the longs to short for the later splits if need be. IF the
trip pans out i'll try to bring some a-pillars sets, and maybe some other
quick fab stuff.. No.in sig line and worse case try 336-687-6539 my cell but
its only on if i'm away from the house or shop.
