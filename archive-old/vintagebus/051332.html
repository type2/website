Subject: got hoops?

Hello bus folks,
	In my quest to find all the parts to complete my double cab, one
part has eluded me _at_ every turn.
Hoops.  I know there are a few sets out there, I just need help locating
them.  I have a canvas that should be done in 
about a week, but a canvas without hoops is hardly a canvas at all.  Please,
list, oh please help me locate some hoops.

any help would be appreciated.  thanks
