&gt; You say don't sandwtch.  What is wrong with using POR-15 as an undercoating
&gt; underneath the bus, and then using the interior and painting over it while
&gt; still tacky?  Interior rust needs to be prevented, especially in the front
&gt; floor areas, and around the lower part of the bus  panels and floor.
