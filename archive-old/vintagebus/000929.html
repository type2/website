Subject: cost of front end work?

Working on the front end is something I've never tackled on a VW, and I'm
thinking I'll leave it up to a shop. In the 10 years I've owned the bus ('67
westy), I haven't done anything up there, aside from replacing the shocks
and an occasional lube job. There's lots (5-6 inches) of play in the
steering wheel (yes, it wanders all over the road and takes some skill to
keep it in a straight line!). I'm assuming this will have to be a complete
front end tune-up - new ball joints, damper, adjustments, etc. I've got the
brakes and wheel bearings in good shape - I'm talking steering/suspension
components.

Does anyone have an approximate price I might pay for such work? I realize
this is hard to estimate without knowing all the specifics, but am I looking
at $200, $400, $600, or more? I'll take it in for an estimate, but would
like to know what to roughly expect, so that I can be prepared to go ahead
with the work when I bring it in.

Or....should I do it myself? I've done work in just about all other areas
and have quite a tool collection, by I may not have all I need for front end
work. Also, I'm currently lacking a garage, so this would be a driveway job.
Would the &quot;shimies and shakes&quot; section of Muir be adequate? I don't own a
Bentley manual - would I need one?

Thanks in advance for any insight on this.
