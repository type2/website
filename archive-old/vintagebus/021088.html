Subject: another bus speaker option

Hey!

I procured some old drive-in theater speakers which I
thought would be a cool part of my 67 21 window
display some day (hey, you can only do so much with an
old Coke cooler, hard suitcase and vintage picnic
basket)

But I thought it would actually be cool to install
them in my bus!

So I took the Saphire IX from my 69 Westy and slid it
into the dash of DARTHVW (gotta love that bigger
67-only hole). Then I hung the drive-in speakers on
the bulkhead behind the cab seats, facing back into
the passenger area, and ran the wire down under the
spare tire and out under the cab seat, taped it down
the front of the seat pedestal, under the cab mat, up
the front behind the kick panel and into the
appropriate fuse termial, and

BAM!

I'm pickin' up every AM radio station in Los Angeles,
there's even one or two in English!


I posted pics in the bus accessory section on
VWPLANET. Here's a link:

They stay put, and are a great conversation piece.

Para bailar La Bamba....
