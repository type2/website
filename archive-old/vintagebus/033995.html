When I bought some from Gabriel, he sold me two for one door, cause the ones 
he has are also very thin and weak. I threw them away. Then went to swap meet 
area and looked for a pitted handle with a good spring, and the wacko wanted 
25.00 for the pitted handle.

 Greg, there was a guy with a bag of at least 50 at the Phx. Bug-O-Rama!!!
 Guess I should have bought them up for resale...
 
 I've heard repros are available from Vintage Parts but have not called to
 verify.
