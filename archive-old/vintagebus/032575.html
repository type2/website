Subject: FUEL POLL RESULTS

ok, here are the results of the little fuel filter coming apart poll, and
has it ever happened to you.  the responses ranged fron simple &quot;no&quot;'s to
long ramblings of how a fuel filter should never be in an engine
compartment anyway.
HAVE had one come apart---ZERO  (0)
HAVE NOT had one come apart---NINE (9)
HAD ONE WARP/SLIGHTLY MELT---ONE  (1)
A SOCK IN A MASON JAR----ONE   (1)
are there any other topics i could tabulate results for?  p-mail with
suggestions, and maybe this could be a weekly thing.  Plus, i thought there
were more than 11 people on the list, why didn't you vote?
Happy bussing!
