To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all, 

Does anyone know of a place that can restore an OG
bumper?  The bumper is slightly warped and one of the
metal pieces that bolts to the bracket has rusted
through.  I'd like to get this one stripped,
straightened, and the little bracket on the backside
of the bumper fixed.  Since this is the original
bumper, I'd like to fix it rather than buying a cheap
repop.  NOS may be an option, but I thought I'd go
this route first.

Thanks,
Paul
