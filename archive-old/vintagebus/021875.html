&lt;&lt; I liked the point that using a cell phone and driving cause more
accidents than drinking and driving. Should make people think. &gt;&gt; 

&gt;I don't think that's true. I just read an article about that (but, of
course, can't remember where), but the major distraction that caused
accidents was people eating or drinking (like coffee or soft drinks) while
driving. Cell phone use was way down on the list, like 2 or 3 percent of the
distractions that cause inattention to safe vehicle operation. Not that I'm
advocating driving while phoning (or is it phoning while driving?). JP &lt;

I think I first saw this in Car &amp; Driver in one of the writers columns.  C&amp;D
is pretty good about telling it like it is regardless of public opinion,
like that ridiculous Firestone tire thing and the Audi sudden acceleration
lie from years back.  Of course the writer quoted all these official
government driving divisions statistics and stuff.

The modern media knows where its funding comes from and would not want to
loose all those big and fat advertising dollars from Verizon and AT&amp;T etc...
I think half the ads on TV are for some sort of electronic gizmo you cannot
live without and sells it as something that gives you more &quot;freedom&quot; to
roam.  Yes I like the idea of freedom coming in a bill every month, sounds
more like indentured servitude.  The media only pitches what the people want
to see and what is PC,  even the college newspapers are becoming rags of
social conformity.  Look at this issue of David Horowitz's article not being
published as a paid advertisement in college newspapers, I think only 7 out
of 50 printed it.  Again violating his 1st amendment rights to free speech,
I think if you have the cash to run an add you can put whatever you want on
it as long as it is not an illegal activity.  There is plenty subjects that
affect your life that you will never see on TV.  The last noble thing I have
seen on TV was the protest against the WTO and the media were laughing at
them!  Big business rules the WTO not basic human rights.  The federal
government is actually very good about publishing information it is up to
our &quot;unbiased&quot; and &quot;honest&quot; media to report it.  In our modern society we
are so overrun and inundated with information we often loose scope of what
in life is real and wholesome, go home and hug your family, take care of
nature, and enjoy your Spartan non-commercial bus...  That is what is REAL. 

I apologize for the minimal bus content.
