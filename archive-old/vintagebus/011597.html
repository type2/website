&gt; He must
have been having a bad day that day too.  Too bad someone who could be
such a huge resource to us has to act like the VW God.
&lt;

        At the risk of being ousted by the many &quot;Hoover-Followers&quot;, I will
be brave and stand up and agree with Rick and Michele.  Though Mr. Hoover
has been a super tremendous asset to V-dubbers as a whole, I am rather
disgusted with his belittling remarks.  Especially to the newbies.  Newbies
are the next generation and without them, you can bury our buses in our
graves.

        And the latest &quot;what I consider analness&quot; on the copyright stuff
takes the cake.   Not to put myself in any league near BH,  I have invested
tons of blood, sweat, and hours into our common love affair and offered it
to the World via the internet and anyone is welcome to steal it, take
credit for it, or sell it.  I do it for the good of our interests...not so
I have something to b!tch publicly to the whole list (that already knows
how touchy he is) about.  I think if you &quot;give&quot; something away because it
makes you feel good, you have no right to complain how it is used.

          Furthermore, I feel copyright laws &quot;should&quot; be respected on the
net, yes, but half of the software on our computers &quot;should&quot; be
registered,too.  Point being, they are both rules regarding giving authors
of a product their deserved credit and respect.  What is the difference? 
Are we hypocrits here?  And we condemn the guy that was trying to pass on
V-dub info...whats wrong here?

         If I wanted to share my insights on a subject and did not want it
copied and reproduced, I would write a book....and the last place I would
put it is on the Intnt.  I know I am going to strike a bad chord with may
of you (especially Ken Hooper), but I feel the Intnt is so cool because it
is a place the we can &quot;freely&quot; share our thoughts, ideas, opinions, and
experiences with limited regulation.   I put stuff on the Net so people CAN
use it....however they need.

        Dont get me wrong,  Mr. Hoover has been a exceptional asset to us
and someday, I would like to thank him personally, but anymore, he gets me
down.

I LOVE Buses not bus FLACK!
