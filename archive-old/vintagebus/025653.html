Ok, not exactly bus related, but I need a phone number of who to contact
about camping at Dillons Beach. Thom.... Gary..... help. A small group
of us wants to camp there in our Type 2s (there, bus content) on the
18th. Have never been there, but it is near the area where we want to
try out a restaurant.
Bob, in northern Calif.
