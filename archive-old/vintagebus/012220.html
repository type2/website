Hey Cal,
My door handles are disconnected too. It drives passengers nuts, and 
hitchhikers seem to get a little freaked out when I am letting them off, 
ya know they reach for the door, and there aint nothin to grab!
My handles are off due to a project gone lazy, but I have often wondered 
how they would fare with thieves. Imagine someone getting in then 
realizing they had no way out!
Jason S.
