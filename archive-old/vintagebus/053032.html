&gt; i've got a 1600 engine with a 28 pict carb and while
&gt; i've noticed no problems, maybe there's something
&gt; bad happening that i'm missing.  the engine runs
&gt; strong and nice and i get great gas mileage.

Rachel, 

You'll be just fine until you burn a hole in your
piston.  (Just kidding - maybe.)  If your mixture is
rich enough, I can't think of any problems except
maybe not enough top end due to breathing
restrictions.

On another note, I just took my new 1957 Singlecab
(Rachel was the one who drove it onto the trailer at
VWHoward's) on it's (almost) maiden voyage part way
across Albuquerque.  Got brakes and brake lights and
the engine runs;  what more does one need?

Well, when you run into a snow storm on the way back
to the shop, wipers would have been nice.  Or Snow-X
(Reg. TM).  But I made it and so did the singlecab. 
Woo-hoo, as they say!
