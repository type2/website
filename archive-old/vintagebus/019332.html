He won't respond to emails, he won't return your phone calls, he won't answer
your letters even after you report him to the USPS for mail fraud -- but over a
year later, you will get what you paid for.

This was my experience with him.  I bought a few &quot;no V8&quot; stickers from him out
of an ad in either Hot VWs or VW Trends, he cashed my check, no stickers,
claimed no payment and sending copies of the cancelled checks did nothing to
persuade him either.  Well over a year later, I get a letter from him with the
stickers, and a handwritten note saying he had &quot;found my order&quot;.  So at least
in my case he seems honest, just maybe terribly disorganized and/or lazy.

I would be wary of any organization steered by this man.

Someone once half-joking told me I should put the letter from him in the VW doc
project, as it was almost unheard of for him to write back...

My $.02, YMMV.
