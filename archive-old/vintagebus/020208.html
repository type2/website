Well, after class today I drove the '67 Westy up to Marietta, making a trail
of gear oil and daring the fan belt to fly off the bent crank pulley.  Nothing
happened and I got to Dave's place a little early even.

Replacing the crank pulley went quickly.  The engine idles noticeably quieter
now -- it was that bent.  Also gone is the harmonic vibration at various engine
speeds.  I kept the old one for sentimental value, if you can believe that.

The RGBs were another story.  Dave welded a bolt to the old plug and pulled it
out with a puller.  It wasn't rusty.  Nope.  But it was kind of bent, which 
was odd.  The hole it came out of was scored and gouged in a couple places,
which wasn't helping things stay dry.  However, this is the odd part: the hole
isn't even round!  The new plugs, which _are_ round, do not fit in the hole.
This explains the bent old one, I think.

We gave up on the metal plug and tried a plastic one, which at least finally
would go into the hole (not without some effort).  The edges were painted with
aviation gasket maker, and the spring plate was bolted up.  Unfortunately, it
still leaks, although not quite so badly as before.  I put a sheet of virgin
notebook paper underneath it this evening so in the morning I can compare 
better.

I'm planning on having to pull the tranny and get new RGB halves + axle tubes.
Problem is that I currently don't have a line on any.  Anybody?  Anybody?
Bueler?  I'm happy to pay shipping if I can't find 'em locally (Atlanta area).
I'm calling the rebuilder tommorrow but I thought I'd throw a line out just in
case.

So, in the end, I am going to have to pull the engine and tranny again after
all.  Good thing I have all sorts of free time to do that.  I shouldn't be 
bitter I guess, the cores I handed in for rebuilding weren't very good by 
anyone's standards.  But I would think that something that was that screwed up
would raise a red flag somewhere, and I would get a phone call, or at least a
note on the receipt.  It goes without saying that it would have been a lot less
of a PITA for everyone involved if this had been fixed before the tranny was 
ever installed in the bus.  Incidentally, the rest of the work is fantastic,
both on the tranny and on the engine.  It's just these damned RGB leaks!  :-)

Any ideas what warps a freeze plug hole like that?  I mean, it's visibly not
round.  We were thinking perhaps it was heated up or something.
