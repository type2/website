According to one of my books, the unladen weight of a single cab without tarpaulin and bows is 2392 lbs. With tarpaulin and bows, it is 2469 lbs. But that is including the tranny &amp; engine, so maybe someone has these weights for you to subtract.

&gt; Approximately how much would an unladen single cab weigh, minus engine 
&gt; and transmission?
