&gt;Him: &quot;$1200 per side&quot; &lt;
Oh yah, worth more than the bus for a stinking rocker.  LOL!  I can do a lot
of learning to weld and equipment for $1200 a rocker.

&gt; Anyway, it's $75 per hour.&quot; &lt;
Crazy!!!  The local Porsche shop charges $60 an hour and I think that is
nutty...  Luckily I can do 90% of the Porsche work myself to keep operating
costs low.

I can see right now that I am in the wrong business!!!  Thanks Kabayo, now I
need to go back to school and get a masters in welding! :)

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. To raise a war chest, income taxes - once reserved for the rich -
were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
