FYI,

This was that bus in Annapolis MD that was for sale for $160. Apparently 
the seats &quot;disappeared&quot; between the time the winning bidder looked at it 
and the time Ian picked it up. Oh well, but you can't beat a $160 bus!

&gt;
&gt; I just picked it up last weekend. I was watching it but never bid, I 
&gt; was selling a 73 bus at the same time and got stiffed by the high 
&gt; bidder. So I emailed the seller of the one in MD and asked if the high 
&gt; bidder came through. He said no and it was still available. I told him 
&gt; that I wanted it , he said 160$, the next weekend i drove up there, it 
&gt; was a 4hr drive ,im in norfolk va. It doent have the rear seats, just 
&gt; the front, it looks like there was camper stuff in it at one time, the 
&gt; table is still there,thats It. The head linner id perfict no cuts or 
&gt; rips anywhere. the rust isnt that bad .motor isnt froze up I vcan turn 
&gt; it buy hand. so im pretty happy with it:)
&gt; later
