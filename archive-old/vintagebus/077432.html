Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

Spray foam is evil.   it traps moisture....   and the cab doors are designed 
so water runs through them.  

buses that I have seen w/ spray foam insulation have rust around the spray 
foam even if they were solid everywhere else.

My next idea is a little more time consuming but I know will probably provide 
the best insulation in terms of both heat retention and sound deadening - 
apply a 3M Spray-On Urethane Foam directly to the interior metal suraface of the 
door metal that is directly exposed to the exterior, after all urethane foam
