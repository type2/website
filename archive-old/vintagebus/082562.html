Subject: Re: [VB] rims

&gt; Ya, the 15s are 1/2&quot; narrower than the 14&quot;s
&gt;
&gt; Weren9t there also 3.52 rims early on?
&gt;
&gt; Parts List say the 1 ton 63s got 14&quot; rims.  but the early 64s got 15&quot;s
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly, this means that for a short time the 64s ( which are 1 ton)
had
&gt; the taller geared  RGBs AND the 15&quot; rims.   As a taller tire covers more
&gt; distance per rotation, this makes that get lower rpms at the same road
speed
&gt; (or a higher road speed at the same engine rpms) compared to the slightly
&gt; later 64s with the same transmission/ RGB gearing.
&gt;
Hmmmmm!  I had always assumed that my  12/19/62 -63 DC was 1 ton, but it had
152 rims on it when I bought it years ago. Is there a 1 ton m-code?  I don9t
remember mine having one, but read that all USA  DC9s were 1 ton?  I also
read that 63 DC9s had a 1 year only hybrid rear small nut/large nut
transaxle-brakes, etc.  Still don9t know what I have? Help?

Tom-it takes a large nut to know one
