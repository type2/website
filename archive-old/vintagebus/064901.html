Subject: Safari Wiper shafts

I recently acquired a pair of the adapters for wiper shafts to accomodate safari windows.  These are the ones Wolfburg west carries (mount on the outside).  When I put them on over the weekend I noticed that the adapter moves the base of my wiper arms down a little.  That little is enough that when I turn on my wipers the base rubs on the nose of the bus.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there a solution or am I doing something wrong?


Enjoy your day!
