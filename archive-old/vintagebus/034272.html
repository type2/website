&lt;&lt;  So am I right in assuming that if I have power at the wire inside of the 
horn button - that is, the brown wire that comes up through my steering wheel 
sparks when it makes contact with metal but the horn doesn't sound - so since 
there is power at that wire I would assume that all of my horn wires are 
connected properly and that the horn itself is just kaput &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
When you had it apart did you clean the points inside the horn?  If you did, 
and you have it wired correctly and it works like Bosch horns the spark you 
are getting at the grounding wire means the points are closed too much.
