Hey All!

Have gotten some great pictures so far: clever ones, picturesque ones, trick
ones and custom ones. As they roll in I am looking for the HIGHEST
resolution scans or digital pix (300 dpi is best) to get the best results
off the printer. 

Please send the files to me directly so you don't clog the email accounts of
the fellow listers. The firm commitment of 20 orders seems close to being
met, so I by the time it comes together, I might be able to reduce the final
per calendar cost depending on the final count. For each one I send, I will
need to include my hard cost for mailing, your choice of snail mail or
fedex.

I should have them ready to ship by Friday if I can just get a couple more
really good shots.

This is a cool project, thanks to all!

Sam
