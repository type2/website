Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch parts

Whether to replace or reuse clutch parts...

Depends on whether you are doing the work yourself, or paying someone
else to do it. 

If you're paying someone else to do it, I'd recommend replacing all of
the clutch parts, and inspecting the throwout arm while they're at it.
Labor is expensive, and there's no sense in paying for the same job
twice. A typical clutch job here runs about $400, and includes clutch,
pressure plate and throwout bearing. Most of the cost of a clutch job is
for labor.

I use good used parts in my bus all the time, but since I work at a VW
shop and have tools and advice and used parts at my disposal (plus, I'm
doing the work on my own time, so I'm not paying for labor), it is much
more cost effective for me that way. I can pull my own engine and
replace clutch parts several times for what I would have to pay someone
else to do it.
