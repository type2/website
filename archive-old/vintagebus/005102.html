Just got a call from someone who saw my Box at the Litchfield show this
afternoon. He thought I might want to buy these busses, I don't, so here
they are.

'66 Westy turtle top. All original, complete with the exception of the
center seat and the childs cot.

'64 EZ with chemical toilet. Missing engine and minor other VW stuff. This
one is rusty and is described as a parts bus.

Call the owner, Arthur Needham at  413-533-3621 between 9 and 2:30 any day.

If you have real interest in these I would be glad to go see them and post
pictures for you. Just send me P-mail.
