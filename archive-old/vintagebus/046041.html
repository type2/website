&lt;&lt; Not willing to leave well enough alone, I replaced my windshield seals
 yesterday- I got tired of looking at the amatuer-ish job done with
 silicone everywhere on the front of the bus.  Low and behold, after
 cleaning frame, and placing new seals in, drove to work in worst rain yet
 and had tidal waves washing over me the whole way.  
 I am thinking (?) I need to get some sealant inside lip and a bead around
 outside.  I have at my disposal syringes to make this possible.  Can
 anyone with prior experience help me out with a product and/or advice
 before I drown?
 
 Thanks,
 Don Thompson

first, seal work best when they have a nice smooth surface to seal against.   
grit and rust bits (holes ?) create a non optimum sealing surface.   I tend 
to clean it up - at least the bottom shelf and the corners, wire wheel 
completely to metal, rust fix stuff, primer, spot putty to fill itty pits, 
sand smooth, redo 1st steps, paint, all these have to dry .  if really bad 
welding needs to be done, 

anyway when a nice smooth surface is there, I use roofing tar on the 
windsheild ledge, and oil in the seal where the glass goes.  The oil helps 
get the seal on the glass easily, as well as repel water.  anyway, the tar 
does not tend to harden, but can mush and reseal.   any extra after 
installation can be easily wiped off with rags and WD-40.  yes WD-40.  of 
course the tar can stain fresh white paint visably if left in place for days, 
but just use WD-40 and wipe it clean after install.
