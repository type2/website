&gt;I guess I wanted to chime in here with my $.02 on yet another supplier
&gt;Oregon Performance Products...

I don't know who you emailed with and under what circumstances, but I
thought I'd jump in here and add my rebuttal to your comments about
Oregon Performance Products.  I went back and looked at my email
responses from Joe Lociero at OPP.  I counted 14 that I have KEPT
between 6/29/98 and 11/25/98.  During this time, I was &quot;kicking the
tires&quot;, actively comparing Joe's product to others and he always took to

the time to write me back a novel to my questions, knowing what I was
doing.  Talk about pre-sales support, his was second to no body else
that I have dealt with VW or otherwise.  The last note on the 25th was
to thank me for the order that I finally gave him.  I expect my shroud
and conversion kit to arrive shortly around the 2nd week of Jan '99.  To

add further, he is as nice on phone as his emails have been.

Just trying to balance the scales
