Subject: Halloween joke

Two nuns, Sister Marilyn and Sister Helen, are traveling through Europe
in their 1965 Crew Cab. They get to Transylvania and are stopped at a
traffic light.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a diminutive Dracula jumps onto the hood
of the car and hisses through the windshield.

&quot;Quick, quick!&quot; shouts Sister Marilyn.   &quot;What shall we do?&quot;

&quot;Turn the windshield wipers on. That will get rid of the abomination,&quot;
says Sister Helen.

Sister Marilyn switches them on, knocking Dracula about, but he clings
on and continues hissing at the nuns. &quot;What shall I do now?&quot; she shouts.

&quot;Switch on the windshield washer.  I filled it up with Holy Water in the
Vatican,&quot; says Sister Helen.

Sister Marilyn turns on the windshield washer.  Dracula screams as the
water burns his skin, but he clings on and continues hissing at the nuns.

&quot;Now what?&quot; shouts Sister Marilyn.

&quot;Show him your cross,&quot; says Sister Helen.

&quot;Now you're talking,&quot; says Sister Marilyn as she opens the window and
shouts, &quot;Get the fuck off our car!&quot;
