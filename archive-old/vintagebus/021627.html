Well today I got the motor out of my bus to change the front oil seal
and something is strange. There wasn't oil all over the clutch or
pressure plate. Shouldn't there have been? Can't finish the job until
tommorrow because of a family reunion. But I was wondering what else
could have caused my oil leak. I still plan on replacing the front seal,
but am just curious as to the lack of oil.       Thaks for all the help.
