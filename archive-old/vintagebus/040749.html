Funny, I'm going through stacks of paper in preparation for an upcoming office move and lo, I discover a document titled &quot;12 Volt Conversion: A Technical Report from the Hinterlands.&quot; I printed this back in June. It can be found at:

http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm

It includes some of the information on running two 6-volt batteries. I still don't understand it all, but maybe you will.

Have fun! Joe
