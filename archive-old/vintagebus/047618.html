&lt;&lt; I'm trying to install a new windshield and was wondering if I need to use 
any type of adhesive or not. &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
VW used a sealant and unless you want to replace the seals about every six 
months you should install some kind of sealant.  We use roofing tar the 
non-fibered type.  Go out a buy a condiment container with pull off tip 
cover.  Do not use the screw open/closed mustard container type it just does 
not work well.  Apply a thin bead in the rubber channel the glas seats in to 
prevent that nasty whitish haze at the bottom of the laminate glass when the 
water attacks the plastic inside.  Apply a thin coat of tar to the body 
frame.  Then insert a medium thickness of automotive wire with the insulation 
still on it, into the groove that goes over the body lip on the outside of 
the rubber.  Tie the ends of the wire at BOTTOM CENTER.  Have a friend help 
put up the assembled window and rubber while you grab the wire ends and pull 
them inside of the bus.  Have the friend carefully apply gentle but firm 
pressure with his/her hands with splayed out fingers to spread the pressure 
of pushing the glass into the opening over as big an area as possible.  By 
moving around little by little the glass/rubber should seat down till the 
rubber is against the lip in the body.  At which point you start to pull the 
wires into the bus which in turn flops the rubber lip over the body lip.  
Keep hands on both ends of the wire and try to keep fairly even the amount of 
length you pull the rubber inside per side.  In small areas where the seal 
does not flop inside properly you can carefully use a slot tip screwdriver to 
lever the rubber over, but be carefull not to tear the seal!  Especially with 
a shaped edged screwdriver.  Once the seal is installed over the lip you 
might have to carefully hand press the glass/seal the last bit in.  Clean up 
excess tar with kerosene or automotive tar remover.   Eric&amp;Barb
