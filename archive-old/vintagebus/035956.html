Hi Rex,
You could always make a fixture and grind them shorter!
 
 &lt;&lt;Another question. What problems, if any, will I have if I end up using one 
screw to hold a side of a frame together instead of two.&gt;&gt;
More flexing at the joints of the frame and much more likely to have either 
the threaded holes the screws fit in or the screws themselfs fail.
