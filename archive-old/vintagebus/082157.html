Subject: Re: [VB] H4's and Generator

Hi Scott,
Depends on what wattage H-4s and what &quot;everything&quot; means!!  If you  mean 
55/60 watt H-4s, a small wattage radio and normal VW electrics, then  yes.  If you 
mean with mega watt stereo, off road lights, plus  running a washer and dryer 
on a 120 AC inverter, all 12 hours a day, then  no.
  If you can find out all the amperage of items used and add these up  and 
then multiply this figure by 12 volts you will have an idea of wattage  used.  
Then check out the generator code stamped in the body of the  generator, should 
be something for instance like &quot;35AMP&quot; amongst the info  stamped there.  35 
amps x 12 volts = 420 watts.  The  other way would be to rig up a temporary 
amperage gauge wired between the  voltage regulator and the main power post on 
the starter solinoid, and drive  while running all the extra accessories.  If 
the amperage gauge stays  mostly in the &quot;0&quot; through plus range, the generator is 
keeping up with  the load.
  Right now we are running a 55/60 watt H-4, in the passenger  headlight and 
a 90/95 watt H-4 on the drivers side in our 1960 walk thru panel  camper 
conversion.  Tried both with the higher wattage H-4s and the  headlight switch got 
way too hot.
