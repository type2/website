&quot;Do I get credit for the stuff that I will NEVER get out from under my
fingernails ??&quot;

Try latex gloves next time, you can get a box of 100 for about $5-10, saves
you a lot on soap.
As for the guy who can't do your front end until Monday-you either need to
learn to do it yourself, or learn to be real patient with an old vehicle...
I am not sure what your brake ailment is...what happens when you push them
down, how far canyou push, and does pumping them make a difference.

What do you mean engine is racing-is it idling high? If so you should be
able to adjust that yourself pretty easily...check your muir(you have a muir
book right?)
