Hi as of the resent post of the person looking for inie body vents
i have a set of outie ones off a 64.
i started to wonder , when they changed to the other style they just punched 
them in the other direction and upsidedown right?

so im thinking why couldnt you just turn the section over and use them as the 
outer ones?
ok be gentle i burn easily.
im going out right now to match it up on my 62 dc.
joe
