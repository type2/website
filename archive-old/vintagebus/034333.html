 Since Judsons were mentioned. I have a 36 hp unit I want to install on a 40
 hp stock rebuilt engine. I am wondering if anyone knows of any problems I
 might encounter with this? I would appriciate any input anybody has.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chuck,
The carb and intake manifold are different sizes and the pulleys in the two
engines are offset differently.  If you really want to do up a 40 HP Judson,
then put your 36 HP kit up for trade for a 40HP kit.   Eric &amp; Barb
