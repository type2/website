&gt; [mechanical oil pressure gauge] Seems like a long way to run a capillary
&gt; tube,

I haven't put in a mechanical gauge, and this is one of the reasons why.
If the tube breaks, it sprays oil everywhere and you're shut down until
you can stop the flow.  If I did run one, I'd also carry whatever it
took to plug the line at the engine in case the tube broke.  Or, I might
install a shutoff valve at the engine for less mess - tube breaks, close
the valve and motor on.

An alternative is to run an isolator, as is sometimes done with
mechanical fuel pressure gauges.  The isolator is basically a diaphragm
with ports on either side.  One port goes to the engine and the other
goes to the gauge - the line to the gauge is filled with something inert,
like oil.  This way, if the long line breaks, it's a mess but oil doesn't
leak from the engine.

&gt; but I here they are alot more accurate than electrical oil pressure
&gt; gauges.

AutoMeter says both are OK, but they _do_ sell gauges.  (Never ask a
barber if you need a haircut.)

In a quick look, none of the &quot;automotive&quot; gauge vendors give accuracy
specifications on their gauges.  Temperature gauges are easy to test, at
least at to 212 F or 100 C.  Pressure gauges are a little harder.  Some
industrial process gauges are reasonably cheap (&lt;$20) and have 3% or
better accuracy.  The main problem with these is that they don't usually
have internal illumination - you'd have to rig something up if you
wanted to see it at night.  You'd also need to come up with your own
plumbing from the engine to the dash.

&gt; Also, the VDO mechanicle gauge I see for sale goes up to 100 psi, is
&gt; this sufficient for my 63 with 15/1600 SP or do the pressures get
&gt; higher than 100 psi?

Not unless something is badly wrong.  VW says minimum 7.1 psi at warm
idle and 28.5 psi at warm 2500 rpm, with straight 20 weight oil.  The
warning light goes on somewhere between 6.3 and 2.1 psi.

As some kind of reference, the '89 Chubby pick-em-up I was driving at
work the other day, with ANSI standard 350 in^3 V8, had an oil pressure
gauge that went up to 60 psi.  At cold idle it was almost pegged; when
warm it dropped to around 45 psi.  It probably had 5W-30 or 10W-40 oil
in it.
