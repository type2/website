I'm just curios, where you live that you would need front windshields to stop a
bullet.  Is your bus of the working force daily driver type where it needs to
protect against pistol packing road rage Los Angeles psycho's or is this the
official drive by bus for your gang of hoodlems.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm
thinking you could come up with a less conspicuous and much faster get a way
car.

Sorry, the thought of bullet proof windshields just made me laugh.
