Howdy Friends!

While sifting through boxes of crap in search of potential swap/eBay parts to keep the '59 Westy project alive, I came across what I believe to be a pair of rear ribbed bumper brackets.  Since I've never owned a pre '58 bus, I'm not sure at what I'm looking at or for.

Any chance someone has a pic handy of a rear ribbed bumper bracket, or can provide me with a brief description that will either confirm that I actually do have a pair, or confirm that I don't?

The other thing I could do is take a digital image and send it to someone that can check it out.

TIA.

Robert
