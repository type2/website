&lt;&lt; why do you folks bolt the side step on? theft?
 
 I won't mention where my bus is, but my side step is just held on with with
 something like a hitch pin...I used stainless steel, but they rusted pretty
 quickly, but they are still fairly easy to take on and off. &gt;&gt;

As far as I know, all the aluminum steps came with a clamp and a spring, the 
clamp you have to drill a hole in the jack mount for a pin to go through, and 
then a bolt goes through the bracket and the step.
