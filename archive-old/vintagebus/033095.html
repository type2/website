    I had a '74 D_at_tsun B-210 that I bought new in '73.  Along about '77 or 
so, the original carb went bad and the dealer wanted too much for a new one.  
I ran across a small business here in Phoenix that advertised a &quot;Reese-Fish&quot; 
carb, boasting of improved power and better gas mileage, so I gave it a try.  
As I recall, I had to give them a carb gasket and a rough drawing indicating 
where &quot;front&quot; was on the engine and how the accelerator cable approached the 
carb.  These were sent to someplace in England where the carb was 
manufactured so that an adapter and linkage connector could be made.  A few 
weeks later, everything arrived.  I installed everything, capped off all the 
unused vacuum tubes and wires and managed to get it all to run well enough to 
get it to a dyno-tuner that was recommended by the place I bought the carb.  
Once it was dyno-tuned, I swear, my gas mileage went from 27 to 35 around 
town, 45 on the highway.  I don't remember the exact horsepower ratings 
before and after, but I do remember an increase of around 20% or so.  All I 
know is that little piece of chit car would spin rubber in 1st and 2nd 
without trying.  If I worked at it a bit, it would get 3rd, too.
    What I consider to be the most amazing thing about this carb is that when 
totally disassembled, it consisted of 14 parts (not counting screws)!  I've 
often thought that I would like to find a couple of them and build the 
manifold/linkage for a VW motor.  If properly tuned, I am sure it would be 
pretty awesome.  Anyone else ever heard of them?  &quot;Reese-Fish&quot;.
