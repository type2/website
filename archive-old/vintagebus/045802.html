Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer hitch for my bus.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

on my bus in Germany it uses the stock mounting bolts 
plus there is another plate  going up at a 90 degree angle which has 2 holes 
thru it into the frame rail and they are bolted together

So you have 2 bolts horizontal and  the 2 stock bolts for each side

There is nothing going back to the torsion bar, and I am not sure if that 
matters

The early bus ones I have seen loop over the torsion bar and are held on by U 
bolts, plus it is mounted to the forks the trans mounts on , plus to the 
bumper.

the real thing is how much weight you plan on having on the tongue, normally 
100 pounds or so is max  

If you look  at old European movies you see people pulling their travel 
trailers ( 500-700 lbs) with VW Bugs, Fiats , almost anything

Americans just like to have big pick-ups and Chevy Vans to pull stuff with , 
but the rest of the world seems to do it with much smaller cars

Oh and always use a safety chain, don't ask me why !...........
