Subject: '59 Kombi update...wiring and wipers

I havn't said much latley and thought I'd pass on my progress. I got 
delayed when we had a water pipe in the foundation of the house 
burst...yuck!!! Big mess. My bus got moved back out of the garage and 
to the shop 'cause the garage got flooded. It's all fixed now. The 
bus is back in the garage and I'm back on it. The engine fires up 
every time without even having to give it gas at the pedal. Starts 
right up and runs real smooth. So far so good!

I had gotten all my electrical stuff worked out. So now I'm cleaning 
up all the wiring for &quot;permanent&quot; installation. For example, the high 
beam switch had been taken from the bus sometime in it's life. The 
&quot;taker&quot; cut it out at the wires leaving them too short. Another PO 
rigged some short wire extentions and slammed a replacement switch 
in. So after I was sure everything was working, I pulled the original 
wires and propery connected the right guage wire behind the sheet 
metal. Now it looks nice and will last.

I need some wiper blades for my bus. Can I get away with using bug 
ones? Keep in mind it doesn't rain much here and I probably won't 
even drive around with my wipers on the shafts. I plan to enjoy the 
safari's!
