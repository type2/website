&gt;Just picked up Pressed Bumper repo's. These are for 58 and earlier buses
and are made out of fiberglass. There should/will be pictures up on VW Planet
now or soon.

Soon.

&gt;Pomona was the worst I have ever been to it was a buyers market, everybody
I talked to (seller) also said the same, but o-well, not very many bus parts
there anyway, but a lot of buses for sale in the parking lot, especially
deluxes.
&gt;
I could agree with that from a buyers side.  I bought some good stuff at
good prices.  A lot of the spots were pretty full at noon when I left.
There was still a set of original safaris for $400, an NOS roof rack for
$375, front ribbed bumper for $125, and A LOT of small stuff that I would
normally think would have sold.

The '67 Double Cab from Alaska with 42,000 original miles was AWESOME, I'll
have pics on my site soon.  A steal at $14,000.  ;)
