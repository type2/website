Subject: RE: [VB] Switches for a '67

Hey, fizzled switches are NOT good. If it was just bad shorting contacts
then replacing is OK, but if there is a high current short somewhere, don't
install another switch until you figure that out! As far as the turn signal
goes, if the switch itself is OK but the threads are stripped out of the
housing, just helicoil the housing. That will save one good switch assembly.
If the whole thing is shot give Clara a holler, she might still have one. I
was bugging her for one for my SC because the switch is bad but the housing
is OK. You can have first dibs if she can find it. Otherwise, Clara, I still
want to buy that switch!

Volk-a-maniacs,

We are in need of some switches.  Our Headlight switch fizzled smoked and
now
doesn't work.  Does anyone have a good source for these parts?  'Good'
meaning... reasonably priced.  We are located in the Portland Oregon area
but
are willing to receive if shipped from elsewhere.

We are also in need of a Turn Signal assembly.  Our current one is spinning
around the steering column, stripped out from the many adjustments over the
years.  If there is only a collar and innards replacement alternative, we
would love to entertain that as well.  Does anyone have a 'good' source for
these parts?

Thanks in advance for your help and we look forward to seeing you on the
roads.
