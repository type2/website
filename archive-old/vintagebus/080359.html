Look in the VW interchange book, it gives you all of the rpm/degree
infor on the various mechanical advance distributors and if there is a
#3 retard or not. Personally, I loved the 050 with dual points for
driving around town and to work in my bug. Power to weight with the
1600/1641/1676 and a modified 34 PICT-3 was great and gas mileage was
around 24 average on the highway. With my truck I have a different power
to weight issue which includes the reduction gears. I find that a
correctly built German 009 or a modified Brazillian 009 works best with
a modified 34 PICT-3. The 010 comes in too soon for me at too low of an
RPM and thus prevents good top end performance for those times I find
myself on the highway.

If I had my pick, I would stock only SVDA distributors for all my motors
and be done with it, but then, I'm not a rich man!

I tried a German 009 in the split a few years ago and hated it compared
with
the 019.  The 009 never seemed to get on &quot;curve&quot; until the revs were way

up...  Which is true since it is all in at 3500RPM.

... In actuality the 019 should be all in at 3500, but I think it is
only
running one spring and goes all in at 2500.  :)

The 019 has 17 degrees total advance compared with the 010 with 20
degrees.
Not sure about the 009?
