&gt; &gt; How about each listmember kicks down $25 and buys the bus. We could
&gt; &gt; hand it off from show to show like that hubcap.  There's approximately
&gt; &gt; 500 list members; if everyone kicked in, that would be $12.5k
&gt; ... raffle ...
&gt;
Interesting on the raffle idea, someone emailed me a while back, they wanted
to set up a raffle for their bus, sell tickets for $20 a pop.  But the catch
was, they would refund the money if they didn't get at least $10k.

I said that was ridiculous, they would just piss off a bunch of people and
no one would do it...
