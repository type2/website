&gt; Just out of curiosity, how close to original are the looms from Wiring Works?  I've heard they go in great and work great but I haven't heard how original looking they are.

While the colors are not perfectly *exact* - they are close enough to
make no trouble following the wiring diagram.  I think the average VW
person wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
