Subject: RE: [VB] holiday gifts (friday)

I got my 60, 15 window a full length bear claw rack
I'm getting my 60, DC a paint job (by the same people who did Rich Barkers
DD)
My 60, DD is going to get a wash and wax job (not by me)
and my 60 Westy got it's set of Clamshell lights it was missing (it's
complete now)

what else could a few buses ask for?  Maybe a set of Sprint Stars (hint
hint)

&gt; since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been wondering
about
&gt; the last few days:
&gt; how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for your
&gt; volkswagen(s)?

&gt; Ellis sez:
&gt; I'm giving mine the week off but would love new mirrors for my F-150! ;-0
