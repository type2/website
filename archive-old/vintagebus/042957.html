Glen,

This subject has been entensively treated in the last several months and
occassionally reccurs when we feel like bragging about how many spares and
tools we carry around with us. ;-)

Try the archive search at type2_dot_com for spares, spare parts, etc.
If you have trouble with that searcher, email Thom list admin.
