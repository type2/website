&lt;&lt; Hey all - I had the speedo cable break down at the wheel end on the way
 back from a trip and put it away for the winter before fixing it. What
 Im wondering now is whether I need to remove the whole cable and replace
 it from behind the dash at the speedo end or can it be done from the
 wheel end. Also, any recommendations when buying a replacement? Sources,
 country of manufacture, brand names , lube etc.
  &gt;&gt;

Take off hubcap of front left wheel.  undo the cotter pin or circlip (as 
applicable) from the end of your speedo cable at the wheel.    Take off the 
dust cap.  Push the speedo cable in, or  reach underneath and pull the speedo 
cacap.ble through the spindle so it dangles free from unde rthe bus.   
Sometimes this is a bit stuck.  Get in the bus and remove the drivers side 
kick panel.   you now see the cable.   Reach under the dash and unscrrew the 
cable from the speedo.  Now pull the cable up through THe dash tray.  

Sometimes people try to pull it down through dash tray, and mess up the hole 
in the tray for the spedo cable.   Annoying.

  feed the new cable throughthe dash tray, and poke it throughthe same hole 
the old one went through to get it to under  the bus. clean the hole the 
cable goes through with a thin screwdriver or spraying, to get crud/guck out. 
  Lube up the cable (grease) and thread it through the spindle.   put the 
square end through the square hole in the dust cap, and tap the cap in place. 
  Attach new cotter pin or circlip to keep the cable from slipping out of 
thedust cap.  drip some oil down the tube the cable goes through, and screw 
the cable to the underside of the speedo.  VOila!!!!

PS, if the cable does slip through the dust cap, the cable will not turn with 
the wheel, and the speedo will not read anything.
