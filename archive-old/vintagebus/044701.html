&lt;&lt; I've heard of the concept, but don't know if anyone has actually made the 
 parts.  I believe there was a good reason why it would be a PITA to do, but 
I 
 forget what that reason was. &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
Some of the reasons are.
1.  There is not enough room in the RGBs for a much larger upper reduction 
gear without redesigning and remcachining of the boxes.
2.  If you changed the reduction ratio from 28% for 1960-63, or 24% for 
1964-67 to say 15% reduction which might just fit the stock reduction boxes.  
The increase of speed would be about 6.5 MPH increase, or 4.5 MPH increase 
with a 4.375 R&amp;P at about 50 MPH.  These increase to 13MPH, or 9MPH with a 
3.785 R&amp;P also at 50MPH.  With a 4.125 R&amp;P the increase in speed should be 
somewhere inbetween these.
3.  Most of all after one manufactured a larger upper reduction gear.  One 
would either have to manufacture a complete new lower axle with gear or 
remachine stock lower axles to accept a new gear.  
4.  Legal problems.  If one of your new axles or gears were installed 
incorrectly so it failed and everyone onboard that bus was injured or killed 
you would have to deal with law suits galore even though it was not your 
fault that it was installed incorrectly!   Eric&amp;Barb
