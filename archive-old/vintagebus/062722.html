Subject: Anyone parting out a 63ish crewcab ?



If anyone is parting out a 63ish crew cab, please drop me a note. A friend 
got screwed out of a title and VIN/Mcode plates on what is supposed to be a 
63 Crewcab. He didnt know where to look and guy he bought it from didnt know 
where they were supposed to be located either. The bad thing is, the guy 
that sold it to my friend calls himself a VW restoration person. I honestly 
believe he took the plates off himself because the metal under where the 
plate are supposed to be were nice and clean. I assume its a 63 or older 
because the VIN plate is in the engine compartment. We wont have to worry 
about the stamped in numbers either because that area is rusted away.  With 
the VIN/Mcode plates, we can get a title.  I hate like hell to do things 
this way, but I dont think there is any other choice except to call the 
crewcab a pile of junk metal and I want to see it restored.

Thanks,
David
