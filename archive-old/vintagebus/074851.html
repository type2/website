Subject: Re: squealing noise - any ideas?

From: &quot;Ground Zero&quot; &lt;tom_at_groundzeroroasting_dot_com&gt;

&gt;yesterday.  When I have the clutch pushed in, and the engine is at idle speeds
&gt;(Mine still does not idle)  I can hear a very loud squealing / rubbing noise.
&gt;When the bus is out of gear, no clutch pressed, no noise.  It does not seem to

Generally I'd say this is likely to be the release bearing as others have said.  Or yours could be like mine, which still makes this racket after two 
replacement bearings.  Could also be problems with cross shaft or pressure plate - but USUALLY it's the release bearing.
