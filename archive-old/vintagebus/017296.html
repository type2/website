Subject: Re: [VB] 6V starter in 12V tranny...UPDATE
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here is an update, pulled the motor and bushing...she
was really chewed up and not much left of her.  Also
has taken a bit off the inside of the bushing hole in
the tranny.  This was a new bushing and starter
greased well, but lasted only a matter of months. 
Another listee has emailed with the same problem
reoccuring.

I am thinking of having the 6volt starter tip machined
down to 12volt size and running it in the stock 12v
bushing.  I am not sure running the thin one again is
gonna be safe.  Especially that the case been eatin
into a bit.  Seems that thin bushing just might not be
enough with the hole messed up a tad now.  Has anyone
tried a different method other then the thin bushing. 
Liek my idea of mahining down the 6V starter tip?

Tds
