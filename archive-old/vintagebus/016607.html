Re: archetypes; 

I'm never one to venture on to Jungian thought. And this is way off
topic, but I'm not to sure that life is maintained buy our Archetypes...
And I KNOW there is nothing Freudian about busses. Busses are about one
thing; Freedom.  Something born out of the ash heap of fascism has become
the symbol of free love, utilitarian simplicity  and rugged
individualism.
How about it ?Am I being too western in my philosophy? Those of you in
other countries is the appeal of the bus like old Harleys; truly an
Archetype or is it a Zen or karma thing?

Aloha
Ken
