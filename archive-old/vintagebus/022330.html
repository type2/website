Well, my gates are, um, &quot;broken in&quot;, but 3 of the 4 latches stay up. I
think that's how they're supposed to work, otherwise it'd be more difficult
to work the gates yourself.

&gt;Where the locks for the gates on trucks free swinging or did they stay
&gt;in the position you left them? At first I liked the two free swinging
&gt;ones on my truck, but now I like the ones that stay in place.
&gt;Just wondering.

&gt;Also is there a good free home page service that someone could suggest.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
