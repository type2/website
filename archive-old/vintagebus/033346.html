door latch mechanism and a cargo door mechanism for my 59 double cab.


The part numbers from my 59 parts book list:


211 837 016B as the latch for the front drivers side door

211 841 605D as the latch for the cargo door,


I have found a latch with a part:

211.837.015B


Can anyone tell me what year this would be for???

-  --  - - - -
letseee- 211 837 016B  is the right side (passenger probably, unless you are 
RHD) door mechanism through ch 705 619

211 837 015B    is the left side version up to 705 619    

you got your numbers mixed up there.  idiot book says  p/ns ending in odd 
numbers are for the left, and the even numbers are for the right
