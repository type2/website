Subject: Re: [VB] Poor gas mileage

I am getting a bit confused here. OldVolksHome_dot_com list the 113-905-205M 
(which I have) as originating in a 1968 Bug/Bus/Pickup. It also states 
that the dizzy has a full advance of 32-35 degrees. I have read on 
VintageBus that buses should be set to no more than 30 degrees full 
advance. My question is, while some folks are setting this dizzy to 7.5 
btc, and oldvolkshome specifies 0 btc, shouldn't I set the dizzy 2-5 
degrees ATC? That would give me 30 BTC at full advance. Am I seeing 
something wrong?

Thanks for the help,

Rocky

Hi Rocky,
Definitely would help to have the whole distributor number.  The 
&quot;113-905-205 M&quot; we use is staticly set _at_ 7.5 BTC.  See about more  info 
on this
distributor and many, many more on:
 _http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm_
(http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm) 
We found our distributor needed a disassembly (make sure to mark the  drive
gear and distributor shaft so they go back together only one way),  
cleaning,
and lubricating to get it to work correctly.
