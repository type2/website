Subject: Rough Idle

I had dual carbs (factory) on my old '72 westy.  They were great for years
until the carbs wore and went bad.  Even after having them re-built I could
never get them in sync with each other.  I remember in those days that
people took the dual carbs off of those engines and switched to a single
carb (different manifold of course).  I don't know if the fuel injection a
few years later was any better or not.  I also had dual carbs on my old
Volvo and they acted up constantly.  Since then I have been a one carb man.
