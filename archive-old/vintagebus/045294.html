I know derrick and barb from wayout salvage they are real nice people and
derrick as been a great source for hard to find parts and info, I saw that
someone posted that he's raping splits just for parts I don't think that's
true Derrick knows if there's one worth saving he'll do it. But the parts do
have to come from someplace.theres As far as him being in it for the money
its his business why the heck else do it. I have had many conversions with
Derrick and found him to really car about the old cars. I mean I needed a set
of side vents for my 66 because the PO had cut them out and put on scoops
Wayout had them sent them in 2 days (there are no spits in R.I.) I struck out
in all my other efforts to find them.
