Man, e-mail ASCII sure doesn't work very good after you send it

Subject: SINGLE, single cab?


&gt;hey guys,
&gt;  I have seen so many single cab conversions it makes me sick. however, I
&gt;have not seen one even close to this and I  wondered if anyone had any
info.
&gt;I saw it on a old black and white movie and the ppl were talking Japanese
&gt;and it had American sub titles. Basically what is was, was a single cab
that
&gt;had the passenger side chopped off vertically right before emblem and
&gt;horizontally a little above the floor line. it had the bed extended out all
&gt;the way through where the passenger seat used to be up to flush with the
&gt;nose, so you could carry extra long pipes etc on that side. anyone know if
&gt;this was a vw conversion or just a beater used at some factory?
