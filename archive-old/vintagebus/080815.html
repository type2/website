Subject: Re: [VB] Turn signal indicator problem...

Whenever I have this problem, it's a bad bulb at the rear signal or front,
or usually just a bad ground connection in the turn signal assembly
(usually right rear) - I wiggle it, and it's fine for
another year.

&gt; Thought I had this fixed a couple of months ago but it has flared up again

&gt; go out. Nine pin problem or turn signal relay??
