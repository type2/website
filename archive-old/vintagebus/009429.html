Yow,

I suppose I'm hitting a really broad audience with this, but the hours getting late.

Does anyone have directions to the Busses Doing Nothing event this weekend at Lake Shelbyville IL from St Louis?  I know how to get in the general area, but that's it.

Talk about a non-event!  It certainly is non publicized.
