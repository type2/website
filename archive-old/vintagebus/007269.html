Subject: M-code/color question

Hi there! I got back a couple of weeks ago from my ill fated bus-pick-up
trip, and have finally gotten over the trauma enough to fully appreciate
what it was i actually got... now it's time to start the repairs and
make-over :^]

From Everett's site, I got some really handy info on decoding the m-code
plate, but have not been able to figure out what the color scheme originally
was for my baby - a '59 micro. Here's what it says where there should be
numbers: GRGRUEN
Are those abbreviations for some colors in German?

Thanks for all the help!
