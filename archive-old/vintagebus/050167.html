Subject: Re: Help putting stud in for Thermostat bracket


&gt;&gt; bracket.  I want to drill / tap / whatever you call it so I can put
&gt;a stud
&gt;&gt; in.

What Mr. Lyle said. Also,

Shlep to your local deep discount tool-o-rama (I know you have one there)
and consider whether you want to buy one single decent Merican tap + handle
jobbie, or whether you want to buy a whole big set of Chinese taps and dies
that come in a little metal suitcase and run around $18 last I checked.

The thing is that magnesium is barely harder than Jello, and the other
thing is that 99.9% of the time, when overhauling engines and working on
cars, what you use taps for is chasing threads. Chasing filthy rusty
threads does not require a great deal of precision (so Chinese tools can
satisfy that requirement) and also it destroys taps right quick (so there
is no sense spending a lot of money).

If there were any daylight I would go out to the shed and tell you what
size you need but you're smart and can figure it out.
