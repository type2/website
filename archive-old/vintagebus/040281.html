Subject: 67 hatch mechanism on a 66?

I recently scored a nice 67 hatch to replace my rusted 66 hatch. I found it
was a 67 after I got there and notched the latch handle. Will this work on
my 66 which has the original stricker plate for the BUTTON style latch, if
not, does the 67 striker bolt in with out mods? I would like to cut out the
old latch and weld it in, but am condsidering running as is if possible
until paint time.
