&lt;&lt;  Not quite sure what you mean.  Expected to see rivets when I pulled the 
switch out Sat., night, but nothing really jumped out at me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
Think you are refering to the rivets that hold the rear metal bell shaped 
cover to the plastic (Baklite?) body of the light switch.  There are two of 
them and they are a small diameter (1/8?) brass tube type used in many of VWs 
electrical relays, and switches.  Rivets can be solid or hollow, triangle, 
square, hexagon, octogon or round in shape as long as they are installed in 
the correct size and shape of the holes they are designed for and usually 
have one wide end already.  Once the other thin end is installed force is 
applied to mushroom this end outward and back to swedge the parts and itself 
together.  Unfortunitly with only one this kind of joint per connection used 
in VWs allows the parts to move slightly until they can shift around like a 
loose tooth!   Eric&amp;Barb
