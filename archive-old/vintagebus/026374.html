Subject: [VB] cigarette lighters
Message-ID: &lt;38427CF1.2B8218F9_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

hey guys,
what years offered cigarette lighters, if any? Were they strictly a
dealer option?  I have one in my 63 (with a 62 dash I believe - the
WHOLE front end of the bus was professionally replaced..why they chose
the earlier dash I will never know)  The lighter is chrome and the
outlet for it is placed under the ash tray on the dash.  Perfectly
centered.  Looks original.  Dealer installed maybe?  The lighter looks
very &quot;vintage&quot;  It looks to work, but with no wiring harness and no
battery yet, I can't tell.
I've had some input as the dealers installed them to the sides of the
ash tray....but who knows.

thanks!
Isaiah
