Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt to 6 volt engine componenents

Ya, and from the heater boxes goes through the heater tube in the bus, which 
is also a crucial factor as can be rusted out.  Having swapped motors between 
my 61 and 65,  the 65 always has kickass heat, the 61 okay heat.    Someone 
mentioned added a layer of insulation aka the shiny bubble wrap over residual 
OEM insulation, this I plan to do.  Oh, I've also seen heater tubes dented like 
someone put a jack under there (doh!) which would alos reduce heat.

Your heat comes from the heater boxes on the engine. If they fit from the
engine that had heat, make sure to install those heater boxes on the
engine that's going into the bus.
