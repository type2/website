I am making the bumpers. I have front and rear, truck and standard bus.
P-mail for prices and availability. I have standard rears in stock, will
have 2 more fronts today and 3-4 weeks on truck rears (at this time, all
being made now are sold). I am also working on making front and rear
brackets and also splash pans for standard and truck rears. (splash pans are
made of steel)

speaking of non-orig., hack stuff i want to get a set of these for my '66 
freshly painted Sand/Palm Green, Hardtop (hopefully soon to be a pop-top), 
converted 12V, SO-42 now a SO-44 Westy. the question is, how much were they?

and how much for brackets?
