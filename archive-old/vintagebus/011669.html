     hey- anyone though of making a &quot;how to tune up your bus&quot;
&gt;video?    That would be cool.   
&gt;


My friend Jeff and I were seriously into making a show for public access 
called &quot;This old Bus&quot;. Our first outing with a video recorder showed us 
that it had potential, he made so many mistakes! Maybe we should bring 
the idea back, but he and I live so far apart now....
Oh well,
Jason
