&gt; 
&gt; For SALE
&gt; 
&gt; VW Bug and Bus stuff.  Most new and never used.  
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased a building with a garage.  It appears that someone had
worked on 
&gt; a bug/bus in the garage and then left stuff there. 
&gt; 
&gt; I know nothing about VWs or their parts, so when possible I have
included any 
&gt; numbers that appeared on the parts or on the boxes the parts are in. 
So, I 
&gt; hope the following makes sense.  I want to sell everything in one batch,
so 
&gt; make offer.
&gt; 
&gt; 4 rims with tires.  All 4 rims are relatively rust free.  Two front
tires are 
&gt; shot.  Two rear tires seem to be almost new, Wards Runabout snow and

&gt; 4 new chrome headlight rings.  2 deep, 2 shallow.
&gt;
