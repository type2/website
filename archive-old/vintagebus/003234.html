&gt;Amanda, does it look like our tent? We have a '65 westy.    Jim
&gt;

Nope...mine looks like most regular canopies....thick 'ol canvas...brown and
beige and cream colored stripes..._dot_canopy edges hang over a few
inches....but its BIG...three sides that clip to the top peice and zip
together at the corners....so you could leave one side off if you
like....the top peice slides through a runner over the cargo doors...real
nice....i love my tent...but no original poles....
