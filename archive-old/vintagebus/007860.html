Well it had to happen.  I was paged to the front checkout at work and
someone had backed into my baby blue 68 bus.  I was devastated but at the
same time, I was thrilled that it was only a minor hit.  I'm pretty sure
that I'll be able to fix it with some body hammers and dollies as well as a
little sanding and painting.    The guy was _VERY_ apologetic and was more
than willing to snap this picture of the bus (with me checking things out
(for insurance purposes.))

I was able to drive her home after some considerable coaxing but it sure
handled differently - something must have gone out of alignment someplace
but I'm sure it's nothing I can't fix.  We all must roll with the punches
and sometimes even laughter.
