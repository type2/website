Subject: no more yokohamas :P

Well, if you couldn't tell from recent posts, I am tire shopping. I hate it
as much as i do buying shoes.

After reading what I COULD of the archives (which weren't working) I was
looking at the Yoko Y370LT and Bridgestone 603V.

Yokohama discontinued the 370...of COURSE this is the one everyone loved!

Bridgestones are marked highway rib; the folks who wrote me who had them
seemed to like them in spite of this.
I am leaning towards these, unless someone out there has a line on 4 Y370s!!

Anyone have any experience driving highway ribs on gravel, snow, mud, etc?
I don't go off-road very often, but I do it every now and then... would
like to have a tire I can rely on to get me up a mountain :)
