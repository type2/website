&gt;    Type2parts_dot_com is pleased to announce a new product we are making. We all
&gt; know how hard it is to find the under pedal cover pans for our buses (1955
&gt; to 1967) so we have decided to reproduce them out of fiberglass.

Damn!  I've been covertly stashing these away, hoping to retire soon by selling
them on eb*y.

Foiled again!

PS: anyone wanna buy a set of repro fiberglass truck bumpers?
