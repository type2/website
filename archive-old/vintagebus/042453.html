&gt; Another point...some sellers miss including a reserve when in actuality

&gt; real unhappy with the final price.  They realize they are taking it in the

&gt; actually have any kind of transaction take place.  It may not happen
&gt; often, but it has happened to me.
&gt; later

Another thing i do is if the shipping/handling isnt listed explicitly, i
get a quote before the auction ends... If they are unhappy with the price
the item went for, they may jack up the shipping &amp; &quot;handling&quot; to get the
item up to what they feel was fair...

peas,
