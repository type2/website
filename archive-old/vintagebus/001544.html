Subject: reasonable bumper price?

We are looking for a deluxe or non-deluxe pressed rear bumper (55-58) for
our 58 23 window. We would like to hear your thoughts on what a reasonable
price might be, and if your reading this and have a bumper to spare please
e-mail us with an offer. Everything else is ready for paint so please don't
hold out on us. Thanks. Chris &amp; Gina
