Last Fall Bentley had a booth at OctoBugfest in Puyallup WA.  According to
their rep. that was the 1st time they'd done that, and he was impressed by
the huge response.  The rep took lots of notes from folks stopping by, and
seemed genuinely interested in all the input.  He said he thought Bentley
would continue this approach and have booths at future VW events.

Has anyone seen a Bentley booth at any VW events since last October?  Maybe
they need a little more encouraging, but based on what their rep had to say
at Puyallup I assumed they'd proceed with that marketing/PR effort.

FWIW.....
