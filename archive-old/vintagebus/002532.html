So I was paying so much attention at Pep Boys to the GL rating &quot;gotta get
the GL-4, not GL-5&quot; trip that I plum forgot to get the right weight.....does
this mean that I must take the SAE 140 weight and get some 90-w?   What's it
all mean, anyway?

I'm thinking that the hard-to-shift, howling tranny in our new '66 Westy may
be able to be helped with new shifter bushings, possibly new front and rear
tranny mounts, and Slick 50 tranny glop.  (Hey, it worked in my old
280Z.....when the mech drained my tranny oil, chunks of bearing race came
out.....I ignored his strong recommendation to buy the ZX tranny he had for
sale ASAP and stuck some Slick 50 tranny stuff in....I drove that thing like
a Z should be driven for several years, and it howled and shifted funny when
I got it.....but those problems went away!!!)  So, I try this with bus
tranny....if it no work, well, what did I lose?  I'll probably end up
getting the tranny and RGB's rebuilt eventually anyway.....

I do love that bus....that motor really rocks!  (WAY better than that '81
Vanagon Westy I have for sale!!!


Gene

anyone want to buy an '81 Westy?
