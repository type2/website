&gt;He's not really a VW guy (he's a Dead fan),

The bus &quot;runs flawlessly&quot;, and has &quot;$8000 of drivetrain work&quot;. If the
current owner had anything to do with that or maintaining the bus as it is,
I'd say he *is* a VW guy ;)

 but he knows 21's are
&gt;desired. My friend offered him $2500. He talked himself down to $3000. We
&gt;walked. I told my friend to show up on his doorstep in a month or so with
&gt;$2500 in cash in one hand and in the other? A bunch of Grateful Dead
&gt;bootlegs. Your thoughts?

The owner will, of course, need bootlegs with better sound quality than he
already has, and/or good stuff that he does not have. You don't know what he
has (do you?), so how do you know what to give him? If it's easy to find he
probably already has it... ;)
    You'll probably have to surf rec.music_dot_dead on usenet to find people
with those kind of goods, and even then you'll have to ship volumes of
highest-quality blank tapes to them in addition to the trinkets and
knick-knacks which go along with such requests to ensure their prompt
completion... then there's the percentage of bogus tapers out there who
you'll never hear from again :(
    IMHO, you'll be out more than $500 after it's all said and done with
(not to mention that the bus will probably be sold long before the necessary
tapes are procured). If your friend really wants this bus, it'd be less
hassle for him in the long run to come up with the $3000...

good luck...
