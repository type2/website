Sure, I'd love to get a replacement block.  Let me know what you are wanting
($)...  Although I'm still not sure I like how many devices hang off that
right-most fuse.  (Ignition, horn, wipers, dome light).  Makes one unhappy
when you blow the wiper fuse at night and can't see to change it with no
dome light :)  

As for the wire colors, I agree with you Clara, but I too haven't found an
affordable source of those wires.  In the case of what I'm doing, I am
keeping the original connectors on and using a male spade connector to
extend them.  My patch cables aren't correct, but I did not cut nor modify
the original wire.  So by tracing back to the original wire, the colors are
still there.

I do have the color wiring diagram, Thom's http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ page
is great.

On another wire note, I was looking for solutions to run a neat package of
wires from front to back of bus (gauges). Barb and Eric have suggested that
people get trailer wires.  I haven't been that happy with the choices and
quality...  While at home depot, I found that they sell some wire intend for
underground burial.  Labeled as 16/3 and 14/3 wires.  These are 3 wires of
16 or 14 gauge (stranded) respective.  These are wrapped inside a protective
cover, intended to be buried directly in ground.  Water proof, also no worry
of running it through metal holes.  Sells for about 50 cents a foot, but the
home depot I was out was discontinuing a brand and selling it for 5 cents a
foot!  I purchased all they had (100 feet of each 14 and 16 gauge).  I
suggest listees visit their local Home Depot!

did you replaced the fuse block?   I have a couple spares if you haven't
 . . .. . . . 

there should be a light on each side of the speedo - so feel unde rthe right
side and check the bulb in that bulb holder too.

please post about it - I am interested in a rheostat too.

I recommend finding a colour wiring diagram and keping to the original
colours
used AMAP.  The colours actually mean things- brown is always ground, red
hot
all the times, black hot w/ ignition on, etc.    These colours are easy to
find, but some  are not and I use pieces of old VW wiring harness.  I've
been
looking in to find souces, but it seems I'd have to buy in bulk.

Going back later when it's done with the right colours is like going back
later when the bolts have been greased- much pleasanter and easier to work
on.
