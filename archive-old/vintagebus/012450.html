Ty Hodges just sent me a copy of his chapter's newsletter,
which has an *excellent* article on tools.  It should really be on the
net somewhere.

&gt;  Does anyone have a list or breakdown on all the special Hazet tools that
&gt; came with this tool set? I am missing a few tools and need to know what part
&gt; numbers I need. This is a large kit. Metal box measures 13&quot; x 5&quot; x 21&quot; and
&gt; has 3 custom fitted wood shelves that hold all the tools. Top of box says:
&gt; Hazet 500 Volkswagen Werkzeuge ( dont know translation on that word). Thanks
&gt; for any help. See you all in Tucson at ABC campout March 27 &amp; 28.
