Subject: Re:  polishing chrome
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

I have had good luck with Brillo or SOS pads.  I don't know the grade of 
steel wool that they use, but it never seems to hurt the chrome.  Maybe the 
soap acts as kind of a lubricant to keep it from scratching??  There is also 
brass wool that is available from Eastwood that is used for polishing glass.  
It should work well on chrome since it is softer than the chrome and 
therefore shouldn't harm it.
