Subject: Re: [VB] New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

I'd spend your monies with whom ever will give you good service.  Some
would rather build it themselves so they know what is in it instead of
chancing it to someone remote.  I bought a recondition trans once and then
took it down to have some beefier side plates and a super diff in it and
was told I would have done much better to have had the person doing the
local work just do the entire job.

&gt; Hi All - Just wanted to get list opinions on this.  I am budgeting for
&gt; a new motor for my 60 dc and I have a local reputable builder who will
&gt; work with me on this.   I will be having him basically build me a
&gt; turn-key, using all the extras from my donor motor.  I have zero time
&gt; right now, having just bought an old farmhouse, and I need this truck
&gt; working now.  I can order a new vw longblock and have it shipped to
&gt; him, or he can build me a new longblock using all new parts from the
&gt; case on up.  I'm interested in hearing list wisdom on the
&gt; advantages/disadvantages of either scenario.
