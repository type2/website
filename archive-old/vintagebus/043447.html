&gt;The condesor contact plug for the points that goes inside the dizzy body 
&gt;was too big so I just put the 2 wires to the points and taped it up 
&gt;(will this not work?)

The wire from the condenser, the wire from the coil, and the wire from
the moveable arm of the points should all be joined to one another
and insulated from ground.  The condenser has to be screwed to the
distributor body for a ground.  If you could time it statically with
a lamp -- the lamp went on and off as you turned the engine with a
wrench -- then at least the coil-points connection is right.  The
condenser is harder to check, but one way to do it is to pull off
the (HV) coil wire at the distributor, hold it with an insulated
tool close to something grounded (NOT the fuel line or carb), and 
crank the engine to see what kind of spark you get.  You might try
this test with your 009 (known good) and then with one of your other
distributors to see what the difference is.
 
&gt;Is my bosche silver wanabe blue coil wrong for this mystery dizzy.

If it works with your 009 it should work with pretty much any
distributor that will fit your engine.

Good luck!
