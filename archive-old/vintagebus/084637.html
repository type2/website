Subject: More on 356 Porsche Pulley and ramblings

Well to fight the head temp grimlins I have decided to follow suit and get 
on the Porsche pulley conversion :)

I ordered the parts from Jim Klasse at http://www.klasse356_dot_com/  I am very 
pleased with his competive prices and excellent service.  Basically I said I 
need the whole thing and he delivered...  Seems simple, but how many times 
is simple easy? :(

The new pulley is roughly 3 3/4&quot; wide (OD) versus the VW pulley of 4 1/4&quot; so 
a big difference there.  I have a 6 3/4&quot; lower pulley which must stay that 
way as it is a heavy one and is balanced to the rotating assembly (by Jake 
Raby, top notch..  The pulley is Latest Rage - I should have bought Berg!).  
I have not done the math for the new ratio yet.

I am still working to get the right size belt though... TBC with new head 
temps and belt size.

Rant:
The VW pulley sucks (and this is the &quot;goldish&quot; one, not the sh1t out of the 
box defactive chrome Mexican junk) in quality compared to the Porsche parts! 
  The 356 parts are of incredible fit and detailed finish.  Even the pulley 
shims are &quot;egg&quot; shaped to prevent play in adjustment, actually I bet they 
could be used for VW pulleys as well as an upgrade.

For a total (with actual shipping! :) ) of ~$80 it is not cheap, but I have 
a feeling will be well worth it.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
