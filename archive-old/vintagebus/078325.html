Subject: Re: How much air ??

&gt;What is the recommend air in the tires of a 67 bus.

NOS Hanover air at 20 degrees C.  You can buy cylinders of it from
Wolfsburg West or BFY Obsolete.  :)

See pages B-11 1 and B-11 4 of your '63-'67 Bentley manual.  If you don't
have one, get one.  This info is also in the owners manual, but those are
a little harder to come by... prowl the swap meets.  Some later Buses will
have a sticker somewhere that lists the tire pressures, but I don't think
VW did this on splits.

&gt;The kid that put them on put too much air in and I felt like I was
&gt;floating .. I WAS .. let some air out and it is much better.

Another classic VW trick is to not fix the air pressures when rotating
tires.  Most aircooled VWs specify more air pressure in the rear tires
than in the front.  When you put the stiff ones in the front, it makes
the handling squirrelly.

&gt; ... and their revenge was to over fill the tires with air ...

In high school, one of the groups I was in had a car wash to raise money.
Most people were cool but there was one guy in a white Chevy van that
seemed to want a $100 detail job for his $5 donation.  We did a lot of
cleaning on that van, and after many complaints and rework, a friend of
mine grabbed the hose to &quot;wash the wheels&quot;.  What he actually did was
soak the front brake pads to make sure they were really, really clean.
He did make the full stop it took to get out of the parking lot, but I
think it took him a little longer than he anticipated...
