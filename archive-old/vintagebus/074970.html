Subject: RE: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

  I have run filter pumps on all my engines and most that I build, up to
1904 cc. I only use CB Performance pumps. Theirs are made in Brazil by
Schadek and have keyed gears and very nice tolerances. Bugpack, SCAT and all
others I have seen out there are made in Taiwan and the quality is fair to
good at the most. CB's are also 26 mm gears where as the Taiwan units use 30
mm gears.
  If using an old school EMPI make sure the pressure relief valves and
springs are in good operating order.
  I have an old Gene Berg filter pump here, but I think it is just a foray
into filter pumps that they abandoned, as I have never seen or heard of
another one like it. It is like an EMPI with oil relief valves, keyed gears
and the gear shafts also go into the cover plate. This one still exits on
the driver side of the pump and also has 30 mm gears.

Subject: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump


Hi All,

What are the pros and cons of these two methods of adding an oil filter
to a type 1 motor?

The filterpump is a good quality old EMPI item and I had it checked for
tolerances and it passed. The motor will be comng out and will be
stripped completely to find what I think may be a suspect bearing so
much of the work related to doing the full flow job is sunk already.

TIA

Michael
