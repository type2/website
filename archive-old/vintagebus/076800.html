it's a 2 person job to install the frame w/ new seal, as you have to push the 
frame so the screw holes line up with the holes in the hinge.  attached the 
frame to latch screws first, and took someone on the list's hint of using 
talcum powder on the seal where it'll touch the body.  ended up using a piece of 
wood as a lever to pry the frame forward to line them up.  also had to pry the 
seal so the frame wood fit, with a piece of plastic (didn't want to scrape 
through the paint w/ metal.  used a hairdryer to warm up the seal to make it more 
flexible this was really fussy and annoying.  eventually got it all lined up 
and screwed all 5 screws in.  
I managed to put mine in by myself, not a good idea I know, but to make it 
easier I fitted some longer screws to align the holes with whilst I got the 
short VW ones to fit. I found some domestic lightfitting screws to be the right 
thread. 3.5mm if my memory serves me correctly. Mike
