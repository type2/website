Greetings Fellow Bus People!

Well, here I am, once again, to seek out the advice of all the Bus gurus and
enthusiasts.  I have gotten a case of Bus Fever.  Now, mind you, I have a
'61 Single Cab.  Not exactly a full blown Bus.  And I'm not talking about
just any old Bus Fever.  I'm talking the fever that comes from those
glorious, multi-windowed models of German engineering that only Volkswagen
could have built.

Here in Tennessee, these types of Buses are few and far between.  There not
exactly nestled in the hills and hollers around the small town where I live.
So I have extended my search to the far reaches of the West Coast.

I have now found one of the Buses about which I speak.  It is a nice old 23
Window.  It appears to be all intact with the exception of the rear seats.
Hence, my first question - 1) How hard (and HIGH PRICED)  are these items to
locate?

It has been painted half of the original color.  The top half is white and
correct. Bottom should have been red.

It has a new sunroof (cover).  However, it is missing a couple of bows.
Hence,  my second question 2)  How hard would this be to repair?

This old bus is pretty much all there and rust free.  It runs and drives,
but needs brake work and a tune up.  Hence, my third question 3)  What is a
reasonable price for a 23 window Bus in this condition?


Finally,  Can anyone lend any advice regarding questions I should ask about
the bus?

I am going to request a video of the Bus so that I can  get a better idea of
its condition.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to put in their .02 cents worth.  All
advice will be appreciated.
