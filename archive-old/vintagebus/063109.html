Subject: RE: Jerome Jamboree XII &amp; XII puppies--

In Remembrance of Jerome Jamboree XII

 We also had a Multiple Birth at the Show--
 XII puppies were born just a few yards behind the announcing stage--
The owner of Female dog said there will be a LOT of &quot;J&quot;s in the 1st letter
of their names--
