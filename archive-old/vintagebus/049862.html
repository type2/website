Subject: re: brocks magazine


&gt;Brock's VW magazine as far as I see isn't a commercial site, but one of a
&gt;personal with a borderline commercial.

Of bloody course it's a commercial site, it's filled to the top with banner
advertising. I don't know why that matters but it's obviously true if you
go to the thing whose URL I am deliberately neglecting to include. There is
no rule against &quot;commercial advertising&quot; on the list so the question is
irrelevant.

However if Brock Eastman sends bulk unsolicited email one more time he will
find that all mail he sends into the type2_dot_com domain (including list mail)
mysteriously disappears. Then the question will be irrelevant twice over. 8)
