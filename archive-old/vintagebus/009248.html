Subject: The Vw Bus in Traffic

Here is a hypothesis I have..... &quot;The faster you drive your bus the more
other motorists have to pass it.&quot;

First of all I can understand why people want to pass as the bus is very
hard to see thru intraffic with the rear window up so high versus it's
modern cousins. That's OK.

But driving on a four lane residential street at the speed limit of 35 mph,
most motorists go 40 mph. If I up my speed to 40 mph the same number go by
at 45 mph. Up my speed to 45 mph and the same number go by. Don't want to
test 50 mph and see what happens probably any time...

Try this same &quot;test&quot; in my Volvo and this just doesn't happen. At 45 mph I'm
usually on my own...

Anybody have similar experiences or is this just a bad sample.
