Wow, it sure looks like someone is trolling for Japanese buyers.  Hardly
anyone on THIS continent would pay that much.

FWIW, at best the guidelines in the 'Old Cars Price Guide' would
ballpark a mint condition, trailer queen, never driven '64 DC at around
$12-13K (nowhere near the $25K this seller wants for a resto).  And a
mint condition, etc. '62 'Combi' (sp) at a mere $14K (not the $18K
asked).

On the other hand, maybe a 'phat' stereo is part of the deal?

&gt; Hey,
&gt; when searching traderonline, I stumbled across these two and felt they were pretty interesting, probably due to the prices of them and the comments like, &quot;Could not be duplicated for twice the asking price. Very desirable bus,only topped by 21 window.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Check them out:
