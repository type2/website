&gt;&lt;&lt; Can anyone tell me which is the stronger grade, and if it approximates the
&gt;'8.8' grade I've seen to often on the Kamax and other fasteners which are OEM
&gt;on VWs?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Kabayo,
&gt;The higher the number the stronger.  SAE 8.8 is fine, DIN would be about 10
&gt;in automotive use.  SAE 8.8 on VW bolts sould be the SAE measurement.

HI E&amp;B:

I wasn't asking about the 8.8.  I was asking about the grades which the
metric stainless bolts come in, and which of those is comparable to the 8.8
often used by VW.  At Fastenal, metric 8mm bolts come in '18-8' and '316'.
Do you know what these numbers mean?  It's hard to tell which number is
&quot;higher&quot;, since they seem to be from two different rating systems.

TIA,

Kabayo
