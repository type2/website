Subject: Embarking on a Journey

I own a 67 split window deluxe, and although I drive it everyday, I
never had the chance to make a roadtrip in it. that is until now.
I am packing up my family and we're heading to N.C.
So we're driving from San Diego Ca. to Asheville  N.C. and the question
is this: What spares to bring, what problems might be encountered, any
help from some of you seasoned veterans would be of great importance.
My bus runs like a champ.
Thanks
Cannon
