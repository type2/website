&gt; II doubt that
&gt; the laminate is still available new...

I was in a &quot;Togo's&quot; sandwich shop in Culver City here in Southern CA and
their tables  were covered with the closest to original SO42/44 interior
I've ever seen.  I need to go and find out their supplier of furniture and
see if I can track down the laminate supplier.  Anyone sourced a good very
close laminate  to re do the cabinets?
