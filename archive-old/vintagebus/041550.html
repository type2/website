&gt; Snapped that gland nut and the resulting &quot;bang&quot; was incredible!  Not a big
&gt; deal...removed the piece inside the threads that was left behind, got
&gt; another and installed it.  Oh....I shortened up my breaker bar...no
&gt; problems now.
&gt; later

Reading this account makes me wonder if the story wouldn't have had such a
happy ending if loctite had been used on the gland nut per the advice of
some builders.  If that broken stub of a gland nut had been loctited into
its threads it would be very difficult to get out.

I also wonder if this sort of breakage is due to overtorqueing of the
gland nut, also recommended by several &quot;pros&quot;.
