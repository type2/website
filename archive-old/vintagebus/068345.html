Subject: Shawn's transaction with Susan

In response to the email sent to the lists I feel compelled to send this
email. I am sorry for the wasted bandwidth but trust me when I say I
would have never brought it here. This is in regards to a VW Parts
transaction with Susan 

History:
I had been emailing Susan back and forth regarding some VW parts she had
in her barn over the past few months. She sent some dark pictures of
most of the parts and described them in emails. Since November I have
been trying to either get my brother to pick them up on his way up from
California, or make it down myself to do the same. Do to scheduling
conflicts from one or the other we had not connected. This week I was
required to go out of town to attend a special operations training
program outside of Portland Oregon. I contacted Susan regarding the
dates to see if they would work for her. She stated that she would be
out of town but her son would be home from his work during those days so
if I wanted to come down I could meet with him. After class on
Wednesday, myself and an accompanying officer from the class drove the
additional 6 hour round trip to Susan's house. Prior to departing though
I called her son Jeff to confirm we were still on. He stated he would be
waiting for us.

Upon arrival to Susan's property we met with Jeff. Jeff mentioned that
he had called his mom to confirm our expected arrival. Once the
introductions were complete we went to look at the parts,  the parts
shown in the pictures earlier sent via email were mainly as believed.
Unfortunately some of the other parts not shown in the pictures and ones
that I needed were a bit less than expected. Needless to say I was still
interested in the deal. I spoke with Jeff and explained that even though
some things were not as expected I was still wanting to make the
transaction. I offered Jeff a set price and he accepted it. Assuming by
acceptance, the deal was done, I gave him the cash and he helped us load
the parts into my truck. Hours later after departing the property I
start receiving phone calls from numerous people telling me Susan is
sending out e mails to public lists regarding the transaction and that
she is trying to locate me. Concerned by what I have been told by these
people regarding Susan's apparent emails I figured I should call her. I
contacted her the next morning to confront here regarding the matter.
She instantly goes off on me stating that I have stole from her and that
I must return the items at once. I explained to her how the transaction
had gone down and that her son agreed to the price. Between the time he
agreed on the price and the time we exchanged cash for the parts, Jeff
had the phone with him the entire time. I explained to Susan if he was
concerned at any time he should have call you. I also stated to her that
if I had thought for a second that Jeff didn't appear to be in the loop
with what was going on then I too would have called. Susan than goes on
about how she was going to sell it to a friend for 50% more than I paid
for it. Secondly she was going to sell it for 100% more to some one else
and finally that she was going to sell it on Everett's site the next
day. She then states that if I don't immediately drive back down and
return the parts I would have to pay her twice the amount for them. I
told Susan at this point I had no intentions on doing either but was
willing to discuss with her reasonable options to make things right in
her eyes. I then offered her two more than fair options I explained to
her that I would drop the parts off at a neutral location close to my
house and she could give me my money back (Sorry not driving another 11
hours due to no fault of my own), or though it is more than I would have
ever agreed to in person, give her the 50% more that she has stated she
was going to sell it to a friend for.  Admittly I would have paid a bit
more than I did, if needed, to but certainly not 50% to 100% more.
Needless to say I believe in karma and though not legally responsible
wish to go above and beyond what is needed to resolve the issue. I have
left it at that, and will from this point forward keep it off the public
email lists as long as everyone else does as well. 
Shawn
