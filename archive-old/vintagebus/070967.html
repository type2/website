Subject: RE: [VB] Oregon Questions

Hi Bart,

Oregon is one of the best places in the world... or at least that's my
opinion... then again, I prefer the 'Dry Side' (that's east of the
Cascades) to the 'Wet Side'.  We have wonderful mountains, deserts,
rivers, waterfalls, volcanoes, earthquakes, wind surfing, snow skiing,
fishing, hunting, climbing, high tech industry, farming, unemployment,
faltering tax system, declining schools... oh wait, lets keep this
positive :-O

Numerous clubs but the most prevalent is the wide spread 'Wet Westy'
Group. While it has a world wide membership there seems to be a
concentration here in OR (and in WA).

In La Grande, where I live, gas is about 170-180 for the 'plus' grade.

Bus content:  on the dry side here, they don't rust :-)

Good luck in your employment decision.


David
La Grande OR, on the dry side between the TriCities WA and Boise ID on
good 'ol I84, 3000 feet in elevation and 50 miles from every kind of
terrain you'd ever expect to find on this planet!




Bart asked:

   Sorry for being kinda off topic, but remeber that resume disaster I 
mentioned in my smoke rant.  Anyway I have a couple of prospective jobs
in 
OR, closer to CA that IN......  So one being in Portland and the other
is in 
Roseburg.  Any of you listees live near these places or know anything
about 
them?  What VW clubs are there and what kind of VW scene is there.
What's a 
gallon of gas cost there?
