Hmmm, was that the bus from Playboy last year?  I seem to remember it 
was from FL, and a yellow/white 21 window...

&gt; Fine Salutations, fellow List members: As a quick note, I have put my 
&gt; 1965 21 window Walk through Custom on ebay.  Here is the link to the auction 
&gt; page---&gt; 
&gt; http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=592090478&amp;r=0&amp;t=0&amp;showTutorial=0&amp;ed=992624096&amp;indexURL=0&amp;rd=1 
&gt; .... Thanks again for your time!

Anyways... Is there some secret to getting the 4th bolt into the redux 
box?  The most forward one that bolts it to the spring plate.  I got the 
3 in a vertical row in on each side, but that 4th one doesn't want to go 
in and I don't want to strip it out...

My bus seemed to have developed an exhaust leak yesterday and it has 
become a bit louder today. Its a really pleasant (to me) putt putt putt 
sound...  Its tempting just to leave it alone :)
