&gt;I guess in one sentence, what do I need to do to mount them?:)


Go find a magic lamp and start rubbing! :)

Saw a '67 Standard in one of the magazines long ago with BRM's and he had to
shorten the stub axle along with adding skinny lug bolts. Sounds like a
recipe for disaster. Maybe someone should make 14&quot;/15&quot; BRM wheel covers.
Come to think of it, I saw a similar design on an old C_at_m_at_ro the other day.
