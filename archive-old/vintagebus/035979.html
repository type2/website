&lt;&lt;  The original wiper switch is still in the bus. I pulled it out and it 
only has 2 terminals on it. Again raising the question of the 4 wires for the 
motor. &gt;&gt;

Hi Rick,
You have the wrong wiper motor in there.  There should only be two wires to 
the motor.  One power wire from the switch and one ground wire to one of the 
wiper motor mounting screws.  Eric&amp;Barb
