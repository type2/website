&lt;&lt; Hi, All...
    (1)Are the window frames on the front doors of split buses
  from say '55 up interchangeable?
............................
yes.   Actually the frames are the same 53-67, although 3 styles of sliding 
glass were used (and various logo changes)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////

    (2)The front doors on my '58 are packed full of fiberglass
 insulation. I am assuming this is not a good idea due to
 water drainage...am I right?
  &gt;&gt;
well, water draines into the door normally it should fall through and out the 
bottom.  In your case it hangs out in the fibreglass and make sthe door heavy 
and soggy, encouraging rust.   At this point I don't feel like making 
judgements like 'good' or 'bad' on this, still on my first cup of coffee and 
kinda confused, but packing with fibreglas  will help rust out the door.
