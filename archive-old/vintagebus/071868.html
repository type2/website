&gt; being that it is a type I 1600, The rear tin is missing.  Can I use the 
&gt; standard bug tin with the rear apron?

Hi Tom,
Yes, but the rear tin MUST be matched to the tin just under and in front of 
the crank pulley.

  There seems to be some &gt; tin missing underneath as well.

That has to be replaced check out the 1963-67 bus part manual on 
vintagbus_dot_com !!

 &gt;&gt; It has been some time since I have had to deal with bug engines and I 
have forgot
some things.  The two hoses off the cooling shroud connect where?  The heater 

&gt; boxes?  
&gt; 
Yes, without those fresh air tubes the engine wil run about 30+F hotter oil 
temp!
