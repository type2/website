Well, just because it's not being printed doesn't mean that the copyright
holder has given up their rights.  OTOH, there are fair use guidelines
that let you make a copy within certain boundaries.  For example, I can
make a copy of a manual for my own use as long as I have the original.  I
do this quite often when I don't want to grease up my original manual.
