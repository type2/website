Hi All,

What should be the correct color of wire to run to a set of ambulance fans?
I've checked the diagrams on vintagebus_dot_com but didn't find them listed
anywhere.  Also, where is the best place to tap into power for them.  I know
in the past, someone mentioned running a wire from the interior light but if
that is switched on and off from the switch near the steering wheel, it
would look kinda stupid to have the light on when you wanted air!

Oh, and while we're on the subject of wire colors, the diagram shows the
wire to the interior light as kind of an orange or brown color... since the
wire goes from the switch to the light and then to ground, should it be
brown... isn't brown the color of a ground wire?
Thanks
