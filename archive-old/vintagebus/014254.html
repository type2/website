Subject: [VB] The Berg Sand Seal Tool
Message-ID: &lt;19991210155723.43929.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

List:


Has anybody out ther used the Gene Berge sand seal intallation tool? It is a 
tool that lets you cut the engine case for a sand seal at home without 
taking the engine apart.

I would like to try this, but was wondering if anyone has any tips. In his 
book of instructions he said to try it out on a junk engine case first. I 
don't have a spare case lying around.

Skid.
