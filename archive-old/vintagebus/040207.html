Subject: My thoughts on this whole BBB IV, 'dangerbus'  thing....

To all:

	This thread has gotten me thinking and has provoked me to spill my
two cents.

	When Bryon got the award, I didn't think about how unsafe and
dangerous the whole thing was.   

	I thought, cool, what an effort.  But now that I've seen the way
people have reacted to the whole event, I've expanded my view.
	
	I agree with everyone that commen sense dictates that Bryon was
foolish and unwise.  But then I thought... Isn't that the whole purpose of
being young and inexperienced?...taking risks, gaining experience so that we
can better ourselves.  I bet most of you who criticize this action can look
back into your past (recent or long ago) and see some pretty foolish acts
that would make Bryon's little journey seem like a stroll down the beach.

	I think Bryon deserves his awards, but not to praise his road
unworthy vehicle and his apparent for driving the thing fro XXX miles.  But
rather for his enthusiasm and zeal to get a bus running, and taking the risk
of a journey, that he knew he may not make.    

	I hope in the end, that what Bryon did will teach him something.  If
not, then all your criticisms are right on the mark.   

	One last thought, (which is true in my case) Maybe in the end, those
that are critizing him are actually jealous of the the fact that as
&quot;experienced VW owners (and people)&quot; we now longer have that youthful,
naive, gumption to do stupid, irrational stuff anymore.
