Subject: gonna check out a '57, any tips
Date: Wed, 24 Jun 1998 05:04:46 -0700

I'm gonna break at lunch and go check out
a '57 Standard or Kombi, don't know, but not Deluxe.
The owner reports the only rust is in the doglegs and that
it is through the metal there, surface only elsewhere.

How difficult is it to do dog legs, does Das Bulli Haus
have the replacements &amp; what would a shop charge
to replace them?

Any clues to check for original or aftermarket safari's?

It has an IRS rear end, slightly lowered, but owner
reports that ebrake doesn't work and needs an adapter
to work properly.  Correct information?  How much for
adapter and source?

Adjustable front end, slightly lowered.  What should I look
for to assure it's reversible?  Same for back.

I'll report back on condition another time.

Jeff
