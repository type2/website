Robert sez:

&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for a pair of cherry pop-out frames, ones that I can just take
a screwdriver and unscrew the four screws, or that are already disassembled
waiting for new seals.  No Liquid Wrench, no drilling out, no rust on the
bottom edge, etc.  I have plenty of those.
&gt;


Yuk, yuk, snort. Stop it, yer killin' me!

But wait, I believe I saw repops of this very item in a very recent issue of
one of the VW rag (I think it was DB&amp;HVW). I believe they are being made by
Wolfgang Int'l, but it could have been Wolfsburg West.
Check it out.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
