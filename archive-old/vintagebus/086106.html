Subject: Dellorto Carbs Starting Procedure

To appease my manly ego I wanted to step up to a set of DLRA carbs for 
my bus from the dual solex setup I had before. I can't say enough good 
things about the running of these carbs, but on to my question. I have 
yet to determine a good starting procedure for these. My solexs liked a 
single pump then start. The dells don't seem to respond to this process 
and I have been trying different things every morning. Once the motor 
roars to life it only take 15-20 seconds for the manifolds to heat up 
enough to produce a nice idle. How do other dual dellorto owners get 
their engines started in the morning?

66 Westy w/ plain jane 1600 engine.
