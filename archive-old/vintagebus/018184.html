i just recently rebuilt a front beam, it had the same
problem,(would not grease) and i found that the bores
that the zerc srews into, was clogged with dirt and
rusty crud at the kingpin end, so that nothing could
get through, check the grease bores to ensure they are
clear. i used a small screwdriver(electronics
adjuster) to reach in there and dig that nasty stuff
out. good luck,
jay
