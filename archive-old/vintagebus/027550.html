OK, I am new to this list and have heard about the so-called &quot;bus-siting&quot; 
feature.  Now as a rabid VW fanatic for a few years now I have come to the 
conclusion that there is no film in existence since 1960 (barring a few 
period pieces) that is lacking a VW (air-cooled) of some type.  Since this 
discovery I have yet to find a movie missing one.  Anyone beg to differ?  If 
so name the movie and I will promptly rent it in order to prove you wrong.
