&lt;&lt;Also: is there any easy way to work on the dash wiring
without removing the package tray? You have to remove
the knee buster and the speedo cable to get the parcel
tray out. P.I.T.A.&gt;&gt;

how would you go about doing this? i am in the process of stripping my 64 for 
paint and it does make a lot of sence to take the parcel tray out to work on 
all the electrical because working in really tight spaces is no fun.
info always appreciated-..phil
