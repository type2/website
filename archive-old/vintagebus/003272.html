Now what will you do with the commission they'll charge you on it Thom? end
auction early? I know it sounds crazy but you and everybody knows that these
toys are not very common. If I get a chance I'll scoop as much of this stuff
as possible. I'm not doing it to retire or whatever. As far as going to
FLAPS, buying stuff? I don't think that here in the Midwest it's that easy
to just walk into AutoZone or PepBoys and get whatever air-cooled part you
want. It's not gonna happen. It's not South Cal. you know. These guys on
eBay selling this stuff actually do some people a favor. If they pay for it,
let it be. Maybe they don't have time to look somewhere else for the parts
or are not on this list, poor them. Let's not start another bashing
extravaganza, shall we???

it

cleaning the shelves off at Walmart you need to do what this fellow ebay
person is doing, what a great service.
