Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

I have had this problem when I put a doghouse shroud on single port heads. I
could not find the right combination of rods to clear the hole/channel in the
head to match the hook/loop on the doghouse flaps. Neither the non-doghouse or
doghouse would work. I gave up and just ran the flaps with the spring attached
holding them open.

From: &quot;craig k&quot;
&gt; &gt;Are you sure your flap rod was bent right or routed right through the head?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Never could get the thermostat to where it would
&gt; &gt;&gt;go from flaps completely to completely open.  Adjusted it so the flaps are
&gt; &gt;&gt;partially open cold to wide open hot.
&gt;
&gt; I have this problem... the culprit seems to be the little curved piece on
&gt; the flaps - the bit that the flap rod attaches to.
&gt; if it gets bent, and is no longer the proper arc, the thermostat doesn't
&gt; adjust properly. i also think that once bent, it has lost some of its
&gt; strength, and seems to be near-impossible to -keep- at the proper arc.
&gt;
&gt; also, i have found at least three different flap rod lengths, and at least
&gt; two 'geometries,' ie, the little wiggles that get the rod through the
&gt; heads. i assume that these are 36, 40, and up, but i have only built 1600s,
&gt; so am not sure.
&gt;
&gt; next time the motor is out, i'm replacing the flaps and rod and trying
again.
