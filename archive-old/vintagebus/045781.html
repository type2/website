Hi Garret,
Try Zearing Iowa, there is a VW wrecking yard there with plenty of good sheet 
metal.  

&lt;&lt;Also I am just beginning to rebuild my 1500 SP and have a couple of 
questions:
1. I have a Webber carb with a square aluminum plate on the top that is 
stamped W-223065 on the top edge and L 85 on the bottom edge. I assume the PO 
put this in, as it is pretty rigged - like the rubber eraser plugging what 
must be the vaccum hole. Is this a good carb for a stock SP, and if so should 
I go against the advice of the Idiot Book and attempt to rebuild it myself or 
just dump it for a Solex unit?&gt;&gt;
Hmm, the problem is that if you ever have this carburator go bad where do you 
get parts on a Sunday to get home?  You might be better off rebuilding a 
Solex and using that for a while.  Then rebuilding the Weber and seeing if 
you can get it to work again.  If you can then keep the rebuilt Solex on 
board boxed up and clean just in case.  Also by doing this you can find out 
which carburator is for you.

&lt;&lt;2. I am debating weather or not to use bigger pistons and cylinders (the 
1600 size). I plan to leave everything else stock. I have been told that they 
will bolt right on in place of the stock ones with no additional mods needed. 
 Also, what is a good brand to use?&gt;&gt;
Brazilian is best for both cost and longevity.  You might be happy with a 
1600cc size or if you plan to keep your RPMs down, the slip in thin walled 
1641cc Ps&amp;Cs have been great for us over the last 30,000 miles.  Either way 
you really should consider the doghouse cooling system or better yet the type 
4 cooler in the doghouse.  To help cut down the chance of dropping # 3 exaust 
valve.  Eric&amp;Barb
