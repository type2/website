Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Castrol and BP

Hehe..now this is a good one....oil, tires, and beer all in one thread =)

Here's my vote...
Oil - Castrol HD 40 WT.....tried Mobil 1 once, but the sumbitch leaked like a sieve with that stuff, so I went back to the Castrol.  From VanBondo's estimated 30-35K and my mileage, the 1600DP is at approx. 65-70,000 miles.

Tires - If you saw me at BBB7 or at OCTO, you damn well how much I love my new tires... Bridgestone Dueler AT's, 205/75/15's in front and 215/75/15's in back.  Extremely heavy winds and  lotsa rain coming to work today....I love em even more =)

Beer - Been taking a fancy to Rolling Rock lately....though I miss my cheap Lone Star and PBR - I've always been a sucka for cheap beer.

&gt; At the moment Mobil1 15-50, but no real advantage except emptying my wallet. 
&gt;  Next up is the HD30 Wal-Mart el cheapo brand to try it out.  If that is 
&gt; junk back to HD30 Pennzoil or Castrol.
