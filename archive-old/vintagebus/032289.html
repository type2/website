Hi all,

Well, I got back last night after 6.5 hours each way. Had a great time as
usual. It's always fun meeting new people and this year was no exception.
Thanks to John, Ronnie and the whole Havasu gang for putting on a show this
much fun every year.
  I had the extra detour of picking up Roger Nange at the SD airport (after
he broke down on his caravan with Rachel) so he could make it out there.
But, it is always nice to have company on a long trip! We stumbled across a
bunch of VTO'ers in Parker and made the last couple of miles in with them
(including Rich's 50 Panel!). Christine was reading the trivia on the CB,
and I gotta say, they were probably sick of SV2s answering! :^) (by the
way, John announced that Christine is pregnant, so maybe next year,
there'll be another VTOer in AZ?)
  Had fun shooting the breeze around the fire with Roger, Chris, Greg,
Wade, Jason and Everett &quot;FB&quot; Barnes. heheh. JP scored the free tranny AND
the cover shot on the local newspaper. As I was introducing myself to NQ I
realized that I'm pretty much a lurker here, so I'm going to change that. P
&amp; C were in their matching outfits as usual and always great to talk to. It
was good seeing Melissa and Jerry too (by the way, this August is their
25th Anniversary, but you didn't hear it from me).
  Among the missing in action were Clara and Ellis. Maybe next time!
  It looks like I averaged just below 20 mpg for the 550 +/- miles and 6.5
hours each way.

Bye for now...

Scott
