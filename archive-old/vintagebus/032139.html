&gt; Hi all,
&gt; *Brrrrrrr*. Try replacing your entire accelerator cable assembly outside in
&gt; 17 degree weather sometime.

&gt; Steve,

    Good job on your accelerator cable . But... I do have one question.  SNOW
???
Do you drive your bus in the snow ?  NO SALT in your neck of the woods ?  Do
&quot;they&quot; put down anything on the roads ?  I have been in Ohio too long !!!!  If
you
hear the word snow in the weather .....all good VWs head for the garage.    I
drove my single cab year round from 1967 to 1971. I remember it doing well in
the
snow but the salt sent it back to the earth .

yup, snow in the PNW.    I put the chains on the truck today.  Icy roads.
Ick.  saw some sliding around.  I don't think they salt here, but in some
downtown streets they put sand down, which cleared the ice off.    The rural
roads can be pretty slick.  It does not snow here like in Ohio, I doubt this
will be here for  a week.  It did however, snow in San Francisco yesterday,
according to my brother who lives there, the third time in a hundred years.
My feet are cold, the heat is like a mouse's breath when it is below freezing
out.   Next step, BN-4 Eberspacher heater into the westy, which has a starting
problem now.  :(  Click Click 

swept the snow out of the bed of the truck before putting it back in the
garage.
