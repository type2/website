For the  life of me I can't figure out HOW the HORN circuit can operate by  
hotwiring the ignition coil!
This has happened to me before...
The  horn already has power,, and needs a ground to complete the circuit! ... 
 
putting power to the coil straight from the battery can't possibly cause  the 
horn to operate!..... but it does!

sorry,, I know you want  to  make your engine run.. not fix the horn  
circuit...

hey JaMIE Do you know Doc and have you seen his bus. He and it have won  many 
crusty bus awards.  LOL  Also he is from Tenn.  :)   (Just picking on ya Doc 
you know I love ya man )   IT is strange isn't  it. My guess is some how it 
completes the ground circuit that make the horn  blow.  OH  Doc take a screww 
driver and manually make the points fire  by opening and shutting them with the 
key on. carefull and don't let it shock  you  later  Mark D
