&lt;&lt; Just press in/out, yes?&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Best to pull them out after you have drilled and threaded then use a stud or 
bolt a large washer and a piece of pipe.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Do the guides need to be reamed, or anything?&gt;&gt;
Once you have pressed the guides in after heating up the head and chilling 
the guides to get the interferance of both down to a minimum, then you have 
to ream them.

&lt;&lt; What size reamer?&gt;&gt;
Depends on the size of the valve stems.

 &lt;&lt;no chance i can pull the guides out of Steves heads and reuse them in the 
SIR heads, is there? &gt;&gt;
    Nope!  Eric&amp;Barb
