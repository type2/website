hi all,

as you all may remeber i was having some troubles with the carb on my
61... raw gas coming out of the intake manifold (i hadnt tightened those
booties enough on the DP manifold, i fixed that too, hehe)

Well, last week i bought a brand new 30/31 pict square bowl carb, about a
hundred bux, 10 for the DP adapter.

Threw it on and it still wouldnt start, turns out my plugs were fouled
from running too rich.

So, i got sick of fiddling with ignition... i have a compufire on my 71
and havent had to touch the ignition in a couple of years, except for a
dizzy cap gone bad. So i went and bought a compufire and some new plugs
etc.

Then i couldnt get it to run still, no matter which plug wire i checked i
couldnt get a timing signal... the gun just wouldnt flash, so i got out
the voltmeter (fancy test bulb, heh) checked voltage to the coil, good.
Checked that the compufire was triggering properly, good. scratched my
head and decided  it was the coil and went to autozone. Bought myself a
nice High voltage coil.  the kind that says to use a ballast resistor.
You can use it with a compufire with no ballast resistor, and get a much
higher spark voltage. But if you have to go to points on the side of the
road, itll burn those up without the resistor, so carry a spare coil or a
ballast resistor next to your points/spare dizzy...  the gun still wouldnt
flash even with teh new coil, so i borrowed my neighbors gun.  It worked
fine.. so it looks like my cheapie timing gun kicked the bucket.  Got it
running.

I installed the compufire with a dual vac dual advance dizzy.  The retard
vacuum can is toasted, only the advance side works so i timed it as if it
was a single vac dizzy at 7.5 btdc.  There had been some discussion on the
T2 list wether this was safe for your engine or not.  I researched and
found out the mech advance is the same on both styles, so i figured that
only hooking up the advance would make it a SVDA.  So far so good, runs
cool... set it for 7.5 at idle with the vac unhooked, checked total
advance it was 26 or so.  Hooked up the vac and under load i could get it
a bit over 30, idle stayed at 7.5... so i would call it a success.  Time
will tell i suppose.

Finally, the bus had been a bit squirrely on the road.  My tie rods, swing
lever bushing, draglink, kingpins are all pretty tight so i figured it
must be the steering box.

It needed about a half turn of adjustment.. and it was BONE DRY! So if you
get a bus check that steering box immediately... you can save it if it
leaks but not if you run it dry for a couple of years i bet.

Tightening up the box made my bus MUCH easier to drive... total only an
inch of play or so before steering starts.. it was maybe 2-3 inches before
the adjustment.  I am going to replace the tie rods and adjust the
kingpins, and i bet that will get rid of the last of it... but thats not a
big priority as its pretty good as it is. (well, i want to adjust the
kingpins anyway, havent doe it yet, like to make sure theyre good...)

The bus now starts with one turn of the key usualy, and idles rock solid
and smooth, i reccomend highly new carbs and compufire... its a great
combo. The vac dizzy makes it pull like a tractor.... 

Coming up this weekend is the Junebug Jamboree.  I wanted to pull the
engine and put in my thermostat bits, but i broke my toe yesterday and am
hobbling around so that may not happen till next weekend. (broke my toe
tripping over a chair in my living room, no funny bus story there...)

take care all,

Steve
