Subject: Brake/Directional Problems

After cleaning all my contacts, I've got all my lights working now except for 
the right rear side brake and directional. Left side works fine. I have tail 
lights on both sides working fine. One thing I noticed...the right rear tail 
light goes out when I step on the brake (but no brake light comes on). This 
is an early 61 Single Cab (640494) converted from 6v to 12v but maintaining 
original 6v wiring. What should I check to find the cause of the problem? 
Thanks again for all the help. This is a great group.

Sue
