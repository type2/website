Jason -

First of all, you didn't say where you are!

Second, you are correct in your first question.

I haven't had a running vintage bus since 1984, but when
going through our garage in preparation for a flea market,
I came across not one but two boxes of VW bus stuff!
Including what turns out to be a bug windshield wiper motor.
One of these days I figure out what year it is and find someone
who needs one.

You never know, what is junk to you could be of value to another.
Heater boxes rust to junk in the NE US.  A couple of busses
I've looked at need some tin, heater boxes, etc. .  
You really didn't think any of us would say to scrap it didya!

I didn't try to sell any of it at the flea market, nor did I include
any of it with the non-engined '66 Kombi I recently sold, I
have kept it all!  (along with a coupla goodies FROM the Kombi).

If you really don't care to make a profit, but want to see it get 
into the hands of someone who can use it, do what we did at
the flea market, sell it cheap.  If someone expresses interest in
an item, make sure they go away with it.  Radio control car working
$10, child's bed $15, Crock Pot $2, jig saw puzzles (complete) $.50,
you get the picture.  If they hesitate YOU negotiate them down.

We had a large pile of free stuff, not the best quality, but still
useable, and the price was right.  We donated the remaining
5 boxes of stuff to benefit the Chernobyl Children's Project (we
have a kid from Belarus staying with us for 6 weeks).  We started
with about 40 boxes or thereabouts.

We had many people come back for more.
Sure, we had dealers buy stuff and turn around and resell at
a higher price (don't like that), but that's all part of the game.

The point is to get rid of stuff, not to make big bucks.  A lot of
people forget this and go home with stuff they could've sold if
they had remembered the basic rule, I don't want to haul it home.

Post what stuff you have, where you are, and a price
low enough to appeal to anyone.

Someone out here will have a need for it, or at least be crazed
enough to take it off your hands.  Jim Thompson (Old Volks Home)
is trying to keep used tin in stock, so always needs more.

Am I nuts, or does evey VW owner gather more stuff then they can use? I 
have 10 or so heater boxes, bug and bus style (yes all nothing special) 
tin parts like crazy, fan shrouds (about 5 or more non doghouse and no 
not 36hp, although I know where to get a nice one). Misc. generator 
stands and oil fillers.

My question is, I want to get rid of some of this stuff! I am this close

to scrapping it all at the metal recycler. Anyone want any of this 
stuff? Carbs, and distributers as well.

Is there any value or is it all just old stuff? Nothing vintage or 
special, just old vw motor stuff taking up space. Should I try and sell 
it or just scrap it?
