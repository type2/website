Subject: RE: [VB] Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels



  I used to import them and now Wolfgang Int. does. They could use somebody
back east, but the company in Michigan is getting real close to releasing
there made in the U S A exact copies of the bus panels.
  What they have made dies for so far are, complete (correct) front floors,
rockers (inners and outers), doglegs (early and late), working on rear
corners and also complete cargo floors. I am no longer involved in this, but
am being updated on the progress. No release date as of yet.

I'll be importing at least one shipment of panels from Mr. Schofield in
England, and if it works out, I'll be the new US importer.  If anyone wants
something, drop me a line, and I'll make sure it gets included.
If you want to see what's available, you can check out Alan's site at
