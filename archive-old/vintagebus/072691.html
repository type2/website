Subject: Side Window Inner Rubber Seal

Hey All-

I am in the midst of putting new WCM windo rubbers on the side windows of my 65' bus. Aside from the joy of those rediculously small slot head screw that secure the window to the hinge have run into another problem...

The &quot;inner&quot; rubber seal (can recall P/N ) that forms a lip on either side of the bus window body hole seems about 1&quot; too long. In other words I have 1&quot; extra rubber left over which means the seal won't sit flush against the body. Has anyone else run into this? Sure I could bus out an xacto and cut the rubber but that seems just stoopid- mebbe I am missing something obvious. As well does anyone know if these seals were originally glued in place or was it just a pressure fit?

Thanks

Michael w/ 65 standard in TO (current SARS capital of North America- cough cough)
