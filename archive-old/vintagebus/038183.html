&lt;&lt; Obviosly, option 2 is the desireable choice. Now comes
 my question(s). The original paint was sea blue/white.
  My favorite old bus color is Sealing Wax Red/Beige
 grey. They didin't offer this combo after 64 or 65. In
 67 the red was Titan Red with white.
  &gt;&gt;

Well any red and white will most likely get your bus in the magazine some 
how, they love that color combo. I think if you are gonnna take all that time 
to paint and go the stock route, why not make it OG? But it is your bus and 
at least you aint going with some yellow and white (worst color combo ever), 
or something even worse, like metallics and pearls.
