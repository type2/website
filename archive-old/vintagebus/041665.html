GEX has a reputation of producing engines that successfully exceed their
warranty of 12,000 miles, but not by much.  I managed to get 40K from the
only one I will ever buy from them, and that was in a carefully-driven and
carefully-maintained _bug_.

Check the archives for lots of info before you consider buying from
them!
