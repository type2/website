Subject: help with M-code plate

I just signed up with this list, I have been a list member on the Type2 and 
Vanagon list for sometime now. What brings me to this list is I discovered 
an old split window camper that appears to have been abandoned. I found it 
when my dog got out and I chased him around the neighborhood and low and 
behold three doors down in the backyard of the house behind it is this red 
and white camper. I went back today and got the numbers off the M-code 
plate. I deciphered it the best I could and was hoping you guys could 
correct any mistakes I made. It reads...

02 05 0

374 A23 168 181
UL 231 SK 654C 602487

My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is this

2 May 1960
374 ?
A23 SO-23 Westy interior
168 88 amp battery
181 Chrome hubcaps
UL  USA don't know port
231 Kombi, RH cargo doors, LHD
602487 VIN

I am not sure on the paint codes but I think I got everything else. If 
someone could look over this info for me I would appreciate it. If any one 
has any comments on this model year I would like to hear them before I try 
to acquire this bus. It is in need of a restoration, the passenger side 
doors have been left open, there is no engine, and the wheels are half sunk 
in the ground. All comments welcome.

Thanks,
Nathan Wood
85 Westy
74 Bus
