Hi listee

Why is there no Front floor section for sale on the market ??One of our
friend says he have a NOS  complete front floor section...  so they used to
have made such floor so why nobody is able to get the hand on the machine VW
used to make such floor ?? (moldering?)  Do Vw sell such machine that is
obsolete for them but useful for us ??

Objet : RE: [VB] WTB: Front Floor section


I had a hard time trying to get the front floor for my 65 DC. The only place
you will be able to get the piece you need is from a donor. Even then, many
people wont cut it out for you cause its a real pain to get one out without
thrashing it. For my car I found a list member (Ton Mink) who took pitty on
me and hacked the floor out of a single cab for me(Tom, the floor looks
great!). He even shipped it here, the kind soul he is! Keep your eyes peeled
on all the sites and lists for wrecked or junked busses. Lots of busses have
the part you need cause its usualy the ends near the dog legs that rot away.
The PO of my DC used a metal trash can and wood screwes to make a floor.
Looked nice, but im a real stickler for stock :) Good luck!
TJ
