Seeing as the angle of the steering wheel doesn't lend itself to
adjustability, I think your best bet is to add some sort of pedal extendor.
Be careful though, what ever you do should be solid for obvious safety
reasons. (don't want to hurt the bus :).... Just kidding.) 
I am not sure how many inches you need to add but, that is the avenue I would
pursue.  
Good luck

Steve
