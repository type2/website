Hi Jim,
For that tie the seat belts just to the seat frames.

&lt;&lt;Also, I have no outside mirrors. What is a good way to get the hinge pin 
out of the door hinges and put the window post in without to  much damage to 
a nice paint job.  &gt;&gt;
Best way is to do it with the original VW tool (Good Luck finding one!).  
Most likely you will just have to apply penetrating oil daily for weeks or 
even months till you can hammer and punch them up and out.   Eric&amp;Barb
