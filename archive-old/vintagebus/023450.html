Hi Vince,

Great info... can you tell me a bit more?  What type of oil cooler, any
special cooling accommodations.  Where are you measuring oil temp.... I
assume VDO gauge.

Is yours a stock 1967 Transaxle with redux boxes?  Are you saying 70MPH in
4th gives you 4100RPM?

Oh yha, what carb(s) you running?

Thanks again.

To Jack and all.
my 67 with a 1600 dual port and extractors cruises at 70+on flat ground at 
half throttle. Temp at &lt;210 in the summer, tach at ~4100. WOT on flat sea 
level is 85+ at 4600+ and after 15 minutes, temp rises to 230.
I usually shift at 4200 +/-
30,000 miles on the rebuild (stock parts by commercial rebuilder), I use Red

Line 20W-50 synthetic oil and change at 3,000.
Works for me.
