Here are some of the comments I've gotten concerning my 58 single cab
(mostly from my co-workers and friends):

&quot;It's definitely....  uhhh.... unique.&quot;
&quot;I'm embarrased to park beside it!&quot;  (I've been going out of my way to park
beside her brand-new Suburban everyday since she said that.)
&quot;The guy I dated in high school used to drive one of those.  In fact the
first time we ever...  never mind.&quot;
&quot;Was it built that way or is it a custom conversion of some kind?&quot;
&quot;Do you have to wind it up to make it go?&quot;
&quot;I haven't seen one of those in years!&quot;
&quot;That's the most butt-ass ugly thing I've ever seen.&quot;
&quot;Oh.. my.. God!!&quot; (remember Higgins from Magnum P.I.?)
&quot;At least is isn't orange!&quot;  (my 73 Westy is faded-original orange)
&quot;Looks like fun.&quot; (followed by a silent laugh behind my back)
&quot;Can you really do that??&quot; (as we DROVE home on residential streets at idle
after the accellerator cable snapped)
And of course, like Everett (and most the rest of us), &quot;When are you going
to get it painted?&quot;
