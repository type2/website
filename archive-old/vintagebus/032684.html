i don't know, since they don't weigh non-commercial vehicles on the way
out.  i guess some literature would have a weight? i'd guess about 2250 or
so, unladen.
and the gas prices (in monterey) are down to an astronomical $1.71 for the
cheap stuff. can you say &quot;rip off&quot;? and it only gets more expensive further
up the coast.
also, apparently, according to the news, california now has an energy
SURPLUS and is selling off the eletricity it bought. at a LOSS, of course. 
this is due to the cooler than expected weather.
