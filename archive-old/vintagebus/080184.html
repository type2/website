Subject: Re: [VB] Finally... and brakes

This *is* bad. If you have little particles in the grease and the 
bearing is pitted and discolored you need to replace the bearing.

I see you have already left on a 150 mile trip. I hope the bearing holds 
up. Replace it before the next trip.

Fill the low place in the hub between the bearings with grease, but 
don't pack it in against the axle, that's too much. Also, when you 
replace the bearing, put new grease in even though you just repacked the 
bearing and hub. One metal chip in the new bearing is one too many.

&gt; O MY GOSH!  Where is all the grease?  Drivers side bearings are bone dry and
&gt; what little grease there is has been filled with particles for way too long.
&gt; This looks bad.
