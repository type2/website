As the brushes wear in, the springs might not keep enough tension on
the brushes to keep them in constant contact with the commutator,
which would result in more arcing and pitting.  Sometimes a piece of
grit or sliver of copper will also become embedded in the carbon brush
and score a groove in the commutator or slip ring.   Although I've
never used it, there is something called 'commutator chalk' used for
cleaning and polishing the commutator surfaces when replacing brushes.
