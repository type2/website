chuck from reno, don't know his list name called me about 9;30
this morning from needles cal. asked where my shop was and informed me
of a charging problem he was having, didn't realize that i also have a
complete repair/resto shop besides my parts sales (new and used), after
about 2 1/2 hours
he showed up fighting head winds for the 60+ mile drive to my shop only on
battery
but he made it.
figured out the problem, replaced brushes and voltage regulator, red light
out
and down the road he went, by the way he was in a very nice 67 sundial
camper
with a 12 volt/120 electric (factory installed) fridge truely an awesome
option
nice to meet another listy, see there bus and help them out, thats one
reason
to stay on the list.

ps;  radio's and windshields back in stock (split bus)
        another shippment of sheet metal arriving soon
        to include  complete front floors, doglegs, rear wheel arches early
and late

cab bed
hope to have complete stock of sheet metal soon
