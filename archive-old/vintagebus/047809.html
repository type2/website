Subject: Red lite ON!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's a tricky electrical puzzle.  I just exchanged my turn-indicator switch 
for a used one that seems to work.  Also took the fuse box and switches out 
to check wiring, and remove the paint a previous owner had sprayed over the 
wires, which made them hard to identify.  Now everything's back together and 
working, with one exception.  When I start the engine, the red (generator) 
lite comes on, and stays on till I turn on the headlites.  Then it goes out.  
The dimmer switch doesn't work, and I seem to be stuck on hi-beams.  Does 
anyone have any ideas?  --John Tomerlin
