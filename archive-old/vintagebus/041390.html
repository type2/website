I think I paid $1.50 for the linkage, which wasn't too much for my budget.
I usually take the path of least resistance to get the job done quick as
possible (which may not be quick).  It's always good to try and innovate
if you don't have the right parts available.  Nice thing about VWs is you
can mix and match quite a few parts and get by.
