&gt; I have 1 of those odd ball bay window pulleys, they are cast backs, balanced
&gt; with a stamped steel front, I'll dig it out and check the offset, it also
&gt; came with a cast STEEL generator stand, hows that for durability.

I have shattered on of those before. I dont think the offest or
fuctionality is any different though. I seem to remember replacing it with
a common one I scavanged.
