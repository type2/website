Subject: Child's cot pictures anyone?

Volk-a-maniacs,

Now that we have officially opened the camping season with Memorial Day
('Thank you' to those that deserve it.)  I need to find a camping/sleeping
solution for our '63 bus and the 2 year old daughter.  Sure, she will probably
kick me in the ribs for this season, but we might be able to set her in a
child's cot a few times if she is fast enough to sleep.  Hopefully, that will
make for a few more comfortable nights of sleep.

I've looked at a few of the usual sites for a good set of pictures of a
child's cot, and I can get the gist of where it goes.  How it functions, but I
would like to see some detailed pictures of how the bars set into the hooks.
My bus apparently had the hooks at one time, as the holes are still there, but
the angle bother's me for some reason.  I need a few good pictures to
understand... one of those visual/tactile learners.

With the pictures, I am thinking that I can make something functional work
just as good as anything original, but at a much lower cost.  The last show I
went to, some guy there had a cot and the bars for $75.  C'mon, it is just a
little bit of canvas and a couple of metal bars.  Get real.

Unless someone has the hooks, the cot, and the bars for a reasonable
price...?

Anyone have some good pictures posted somewhere?
Thanks in advance,
Greg
