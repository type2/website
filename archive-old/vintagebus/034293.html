	Okay, you have a new old factory 12v 66 Kombi with a 1600 single
port sitting in your garage. It's been shipped via truck some 2000 miles.
After re-attaching the ignition wire to the solenoid, she starts, runs a bit
choppy. After it warms up, it stalls. Worse, there's a red generator light
on. You look at the fan belt and see it is ready to fly off, so you remove 5
shims and tighten it. But the G-light keeps glowing. You vow to get her
runnin' smooth and get that light to shut off over the weekend.

	What do you do now?
