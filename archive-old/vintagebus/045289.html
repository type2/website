Hi Patrick,
You should be able to pick up a spare starter for your local wrecking yard fro
very little and even if the starter turns out to be bad the solinoid probably
will be good and can be transfered to your present starter.  Make sure you
check your battery cables and if you have the slightest doubt replace them and
see if that makes a difference.  Also get your brakes apart, cleaned, greased
and fixed now!!!!!!!!     Eric &amp; Barb
