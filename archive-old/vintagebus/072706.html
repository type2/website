Subject: &quot;Busses by the Falls&quot; details wanted

I was recently contacted by &quot;Randall Petersen&quot; &lt;asic00_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt; who is
currently seeking additional information and details regarding &quot;Busses by the
Falls&quot; in Niagara Falls, Ontario, June 20-22.

Although a website is said to exist for the event (URL Unknown) general
information is still needed.

Exact event location and venue name, a graphic map, promoter contact names,
email addresses, phone numbers, anticipated costs/fees, etc., would help. 

Being in Arizona, I will not be attending nor do I know any of the above
desired details. Please pump all correspondence via public email lists, the
official event website or popular &quot;German car&quot; related websites.

I would encourage the promoter or promoting club to add these bits of wisdom to
their website and contact Mr. Petersen as a courtesy. I would also encourage
adding this information to theSamba_dot_com via everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com.
Good luck in this regard. I truly hope that everyone who can attend this event
and have a great and safe time.
Peace,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
