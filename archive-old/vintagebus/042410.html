Subject: boot for shift rod...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10002281534330.86872-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

In my torching of the front shift rod i have melted a boot that was there
and am having trouble finding a replacement...

It went behind the coupler and sealed between the shift rod and the
chassis tube to keep nastiness out...

i think the pn is 211 711 167a, but im not sure.

Anyone know where i can get this or if there is a suitable replacement
available (like a honda rack and pinion boot or something??

thanks,

Steve
