come with new spring plates.

&gt;
&gt;4sale this is a new kit from wolf gang int
&gt;www.wolfgangint_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;Straight Swing Axle Conversion
&gt;
&gt;. Pre 1967 bus owners can now lower the rear of their
&gt;bus 3 1/2î or more, removing the low geared reduction
&gt;boxes and obtaining enine saving highway gearing. The
&gt;basic bolt-on kit comes with spring plates, axle
&gt;tubes, gaskets and complete instructions. Other
&gt;components needed are 1968 bug or any swing axle type
&gt;3, long axles and brake assemblies. You can use your
&gt;existing bus tranaxle; however, you will need to flop
&gt;your ring gear over. Another way is to use an entire
&gt;trans out of a bug or type 3. Sold on an exchange
&gt;basis for the spring plates. This kit lowers the back
&gt;at least 3 1/2î, there is no way to raise this kit
&gt;from there. If 3 1/2î is to low see the IRS kit.
&gt;2501101 (T2,55-67) $189.95
&gt;2501101CO (Spring plate core, T2,55-67) $100.00
&gt;
&gt;their cost is 289.95
