the arms on my side mirrors are rusting, i believe the PO told me he had
gotten them from Wolfsberg West(this was about 3 years ago) The door still
opens and closes pretty easily....but since I have access to a mill shop I was
thinking of refabricating these out of a higher quality stainless steel....or
should they be chromed...any ideas or suggestions...TIA
