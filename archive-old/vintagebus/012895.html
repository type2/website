A while ago I asked a question about mixing oil-filled
shocks up front and gas shocks in the rear of a Bus.

Got some good responses about oil-filled vs. gas.  The
general opinion was not to mix the 2, no direct experience
really with a mixture.  Opinons were that oil-filled give a
better ride, even on lowered Buses.

Anyway, I drove for a week with oil-filled up front and gas
on the rear and then decided to put on oil-filled to see if
there was a difference.  The oil-filled are Monroe LE10002
shocks (Barndoor-suitable super short shocks).  The gas
were KYB Gas-A-Just &quot;lowered shocks&quot; as my Barndoor has
shorter-than-normal rear shock travel.

Results?  No real difference between the 2 sets in terms of
ride quality.  I consider myself able to tell since I can
tell when my front end needs greasing.  :)  It did feel
like I had a bit more cornering ability with the gas shocks
in the rear.  Overall, an improvement just having rear
shocks at all, I had previously been driving with nothing
on the rear.  You get tossed about *a lot* more from wind,
trucks, etc. with the &quot;no-rear-shock&quot; setup.

I suspect switching the fronts from oil-filled to gas would
have a more noticeable change a every Bus I've driven or
ridden in with gas up front had a crappy ride, lowered or
not.
