Hi Steve et al,  sorry, truly no offense intended by not quoting fully.   I 
didn't realise it was all crucial, I wanted to save bandwidth.    Of course 
you can express your opinion, no problem.  I didn't mean to imply anything 
else.

BTW  &amp;  OBC,  talking about importing/exporting buses,  some individual 
imported my 65 westy into the US, it was originally sold in Germany by the M 
code tag (no port code means Germany right?) though it was ordered w/ N Am 
bumpers/ wiring/ miles speedo like they bought it there INTENDING to bring it 
back.  I think it was an Air Force guy.   Seen a number of buses individuals 
have brought over, most of the unusual ones are, like the sliding door 
sliding&amp; sunroof 64 standards I saw, a weenie wagon (SO1) etc, though a 
friend has a sliding sunroof standard with a Seattle port code.  (odd!)
=  == = = = = == = = =

If you're going to quote me put the whole thing in will ya?

I did say that I know that there are US people importing and exporting.  If 
you want to send your bus back...go ahead.

Since this dude solicited ME I get to express my opinion on his business 
&quot;opportunity&quot;.




 Whatever.
