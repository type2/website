Subject: cylinder head temp gauge

hello all...
I just picked up an EMPI cylinder head temp gauge (60-140 degrees
celsius range) and all I got was the gauge with a thick wire coming out
of the back...and the light bulb in the gauge.  I'm wondering how I go
about hooking this up.  It looks just like, and is the same size as, a
bus gas gauge.  it has the 2 threaded posts and the light bulb fixture
on it just like the gas gauge too... but other than that...it just has
this fat wire coming out of it.  I imagine this goes to the sending
unit.  I've never hooked one of these up before...and have a few
questions.  for one..how does it get power?  does one just run this big
fat wire to the sending unit?  How should I mount the sending unit...and
what part of the head should I put it in?  Where can I get a sending
unit for it?

Thanks! - Isaiah
