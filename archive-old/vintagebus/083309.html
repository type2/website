Subject: Re: [VB] Urethane tranee mounts

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone out there using urethane trannee mounts rather than the standard 
&gt; rubber ones? What is the difference?

From my experience, the cheap urethane munts crack. The 'nicer' ones distort 
over time which among other things, makes it  a pain to remove them the next 
time you need to (can't get a wrench or socket on the countersunk nuts 
anymore).

I love urethane in many other places in the VW, but trans mounts is one 
place I refuse to use it for anymore. Good OEM rubber mounts are plenty 
strong.  My bug was doing 12.20's with sky-high wheelies with regular rubber 
mounts last year. I only switched to solid mounts early this year so I could 
fab up more frame horn bracing to the mount itself. Otherwise, no problem.
