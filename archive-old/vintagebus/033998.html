Hi Steve, &amp; Rachelle,
You never want to justy crank down the steering tightening screw.  With the 
front tires slightly off the ground and steering centered.  You then loosen 
the lock nut, and tighten the screw until you just feel it hit bottom.  Then 
unscrew it about 1/8 turn or a little more, and retighten the lock nut.  
Check that the steering does not have any tight spots in it while turning the 
steering from side to side.  If there is any tight spots loosen the screw a 
little more until the tight spots are gone.  Most likely though the steering 
box is little if at all your trouble so you will have to completely go 
through all of the front end to remove all slack.  This is very easy to do 
and will make your bus much safer if you have the VW bus shop manual or the 
Bentley reprint of this to use as a referance.   Eric&amp;Barb
