Subject: 65 door panels material source

What is the best material to use for interior panels for a 64-67 bus?
I have redone all the screw in panels with 1/8&quot; hard board and they work
great.

The front doors and rear hatch use the snap in clips.  the ones that you
can get right now are too short to use with 1/8&quot; material.  What are you
all using.

Also,  the rear corners need some sort of material that can bend alot.
hardboard does not bend much at all.  I think the factory used some sort
of paper material.  What are you all doing here?

Lastly, what color should these corner panels be painted?  I beleave
that they were not covered in material but left painted with some
texture.  My bus has a grey S&amp;P interior.

Thanks
Matthew
