high elevations do to get there cars to run better?
Hi Joel,
You can also adjust the air/fuel mixture leaner since the engine does not 
need so much fuel due to less air availible.  Of course readjusting the 
mixture sometime before you get down to your normal altitude is wise to 
prevent it from running to lean and thusly too hot.

&gt;&gt;A Big-Sert version of the Time-Sert can return up to a 9/16&quot; hole to 
12x1.5. It
can't help me with the 5/8&quot; holes I've got in my otherwise lovely RGB. &lt;&lt;

Darned, we we afraid that might be the case!  If the oversized holes in your 
RGBs have threads you can have a machine shop drill and tap a set of 5/8&quot; 
bolts with 12x1.5 tapped holes through them.  Wrench these bolts into place 
and mark for cutting to be slightly below the surface of the RGBs.  Back out 
the bolts and hacksaw each about 2/3 of the thickness of the bolts thickness. 
 Wrench the bolts back down and bend off the heads.  File/Dremil any high 
points and make sure to drill and pin the 5/8&quot; threads to prevent these solid 
inserts from backing out.
