Hello everyone,
I know there has been alot about bus graveyards and places to buy parts on 
here lately, but is there anyone who has or knows the whereabouts of a 
Deluxe interior in half decent shape that they are dying to sell?
I don't care so much about the door panels but it is the bench seats that 
I'm looking for. They can be re-covered so just the frames in decent 
condition would be a blessing.
We'll be down to the seattle shows in a week and a half and could have a 
look there. Whatever the case may be.

Andy
