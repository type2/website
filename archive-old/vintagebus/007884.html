Subject: Burning Man

I have noticed lately in Pmail and on the list, a few people going to the
Black Rock Desert for Burning Man.
Who all is going?
I live about 100 miles from Black Rock, probably the closest listee. If
anyone would like to get their bus washed off or at least get the dust and
dirt off afterwards and is going to be heading thru Fallon, let me know.
That way I can meet some of ya in person.
