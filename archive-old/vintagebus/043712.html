&gt;I finally got that seized to bolt off of my Westy, and put the new shock on
&gt;with lots of anti-seize.

I think you were the one complaining about penetrating oil the other 
day.  :)  I have no personal experience, but I have seen many people
online swear by &quot;PB Blaster&quot; penetrating oil.  Around here Wal-Mart
sells it.  Maybe you have already tried it and found it wanting, but
I thought I'd pass it along.
