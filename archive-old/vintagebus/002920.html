I said that any offers would be considered.  I paid $225 plus shipping for
the BN4 myself, $35 or so for the glow plug (from a listee, correct me if
I'm wrong), and $40 for the spare pump.  I'm asking for less than I've got
in it (I recall a recent thread here...).  I guess I'm a retard then, eh?
I'm not making any extra money but I don't want to eat this thing.  $175 is
a better deal though, I wish it would have been up for grabs when I bought
this one.
