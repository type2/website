Subject: Copper or steel brakelines?

I am going to replace my brakelines as a few of the grommets are breaking
up, and as they are the original steel ones I think it would be safest to
replace them.
I can get complete brakeline kits easily in the UK, but some companies sell
them with copper lines and others sell them with steel.  I am not going to
get a true answer if I ask the companies and I expect other people have
replaced their lines before.
So any reasons for choosing one over the other?  Or  should I just make my
own lines out of copper?

Thanks
Paul
