&gt; You!  Where did you buy that single cab?  I'll bet you bought it from GERMANY!
&gt; That's what's driving those prices up over there...!  German buses should stay
&gt; in Germany!  I get so upset when I see a good German bus go to the states.  
&gt; Bah!  You should all drive Escorts!  ;-)


Hey now!  Whats wrong with Escorts?  I bought my race car for 170 
bucks.  (Do you smell clutch?)  Let the escort rust and the buses rest.  
I just busted a shock tower mount.... and guess what.... I'm not going 
to do a damn thing about it!  (thank you rust lords)  I busted it on the 
escort that is...

Maybe the Japanese will want to buy my escort in 30 years.  It'll have 
&quot;rust in all the usual escort places...but a great project!!  Needs a 
clutch.  99% complete!!! - $35,000.... comes with fold down back 
seat!!!!!!  Rare statioin wagon 4 speed model!!!&quot;
