Subject: Re: [T2] Way too much money....


&gt;I posted about an estate auction last month near Conrad Montana, 50+
&gt;vintage cars, sold by a big auction outfit.
&gt;I couldn't even afford to get in to watch (letter of credit from bank)
&gt;but a buddy of mine from Great Falls was up there and bought an old
&gt;Buick or something.
&gt;He said the '65 23? Window with &lt;45k miles went for ~$18,000.00!   the
&gt;72 station wagon with 55k miles went for $5,000.00.
&gt;I don't feel so bad about not getting up there to witness it now.

I went to one in 1995 near Dalton, GA where some big carpet money fellow 
passed away and his family was selling everything off from his collection. 
He had a big warehouse with HVAC full of EVERYTHING - wagons, carriages, 
Lambroghini, Ferrari, VW, Porsche, Deusenberg, Mercedes, etc. These cars 
were often selling for prices well into the 6 digits. Got in courtesy of a 
friend of my father's and watched the bidding while I tried not to show my 
shock at the prices.

The guy had 2 DOZEN sixties vintage Jaguars - many the same body, same 
year, and same color. Didn't understand why but I liked looking at them. 
They were also selling huge crates of car parts all lumped together (you 
didn't know what was in there) and about a dozen cars that were in need of 
a restoration (barn queens).

All in all a couple hundred (?) cars. Many went WAY high (highest was close 
to $400K for a mid thirties Mercedes convertible. This guy was so rich he 
had  staff on duty and if he wanted to drive a car he would call ahead and 
have them get the car out, install a battery, and get it warmed up for him....
