Subject: Re: [VB] safari windows

The safaris glass is smaller than the windsheild glass.   You would need to 
get safari frame, seal, windsheild glass, latches, dasg tabs, etc, sounds 
like close to a full set.  Sounds like you have the bits thewing nuts thread 
into- the brackets at each siode and the middle.    Probably a company that 
makes safaris would sell partial kits, could ask at least.

 In my recently acquired van both safari windows had been removed. I 
 would like to now put them back in. Does the windshield glass fit the 
 frames?
 
 I am missing the wing bolt hardware and the lock tabs that hold the 
 twist locks at the bottom of the windshield.
 
 Also needed are stainless steel sheet metal screws to reattach the hinge 
 to the bus at the top of the windows.
 
 I'm looking for these hardware items and only find full kits for sale. 
 Does anyone know where I can find just parts? Thanks for your ideas in 
 advance.
