&gt; think Franklin's VW Werks does a bunch and has a good webpage, so 
&gt; check that to see what is involved (scary).

&gt; My words of wisdom are do small things that are reversable if you ever 
&gt; want to bring it back to stock.  These old busses are rare these days.

FWIW........

I drive multiple &quot;slammed&quot; Buses with no problems. I do *all* of the 
work myself, so the cost is low, but if you need to have some else do 
the work, be prepared to drop some coin. Adrian is correct, getting a 
Bus down low *and* doing it right is difficult. Not brian surgery 
difficult, but difficult nonetheless. If this is something you've never 
done before, don't. Find someone (reputable) to do it for you, or at 
least to guide you. I realize that location may be a factor, but their 
are a number of places, myself included, that can do the work Franklin's 
does at about 1/2 the cost.
