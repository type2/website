I can say that eBay has helped me get parts I needed for my bus without
spending a lot of money. Every time I look at something I check with a few
sources to see how much I should pay without going crazy. But true, not
everything arrives as described. Can you do something about it? not much
really. I can only say that without eBay I wouldn't get the parts I needed.
Here, in the great Midwest there are no swap meets and shows are sporadic. I
can only say, do your homework before you bid and bid accordingly.

Later,

&gt; I've bought some HTF trinkets on there too, and I can defend it as a good
&gt; place for that.  BUT!  You need to have your cautious head on.  And
&gt; the common-sense one.  In the example of the seatbelts, the auction
&gt; text said &quot;new&quot; - it should have occured to the guy to find out if they
&gt; were available somewhere else.  Can't really fault him for not knowing,
&gt; and I too have been suckered the same way.  It's a learning process.
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, there's still a lot of blatant misrepresentation on there.  I have
&gt; personally bought parts purported to be NOS, only to get them in my hot
&gt; little hands and find they were not.  Chrome polish does not turn back
&gt; the hands of time and magically make something NOS.  Nor does
media-blasting
&gt; and rattle-canning.
