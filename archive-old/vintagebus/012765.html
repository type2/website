snip..

It makes a big difference if the bumpers are ribbed,
slash, or pointed. And if the trim is for a 23/15 or 21/13

.............

can't see the diff that the number of windows (or lack of) above the roofline
would make to beltline aluminum. obviously the rear door is significantly
different on &lt;64 and &gt;64 and so is the trim

if anyone can find a way to ship the drivers side aluminum (the one that runs
&gt;from behind the front door all the way to the rear hatch) i would like to know
it.

fwiw the aluminum is *very* easy to bend/warp unininetionally. so that long
drivers piece would be a joy to ship you can also bend it back pretty easy but
would rather not fool w/ it

do you also have the rocker trim pieces? these are often missing on rusted out
busses..


window bus.
