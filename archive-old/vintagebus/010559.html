Just as a warning, this will be a long one. 
    In April of '99, after a long time searching newspapers and the Internet 
for a good type 2, I instead found a '54 b*g in Benicia.  I live 5 minutes 
from Pomona, so I had a 6 hr drive each way. I paid $800 for it and was very 
excited. After spending another few months and $600 on parts it ended up 
sitting in the driveway for 1/2 a year. Because of the high price for parts 
and the search it required, I spent another 6 mos. trying to trade it for a 
bus. Many of you on the list responded to my offer for a trade. I finally 
decided on a '58 from Northern California. I made arrangements with the guy 
to get it and we met in Harris Ranch in Central Cali. some of you might also 
remember the story about it falling off the trailer on the way home. I took a 
lot of heat from you guys for that one (sorry). A few weeks after buying it I 
found a later Westy kit for $150 in Ventura, it had everything but the sink 
and the jumper seat. Luckily those were the only things that the bus had in 
the interior for some reason. That was yet another story when I had an 
electrical fire on the way to go get it. But I loaded up my truck and had it 
all towed home for $400, ouch!
    So after doing about as much as I could with my limited skill, my mom 
decided to help me out (financially) if I just took it to a mechanic to get 
it running. I told her it would only cost about $250. I was told it was 
converted to 12 V, but for some reason it only had a 12Vstarter. That is when 
the money started pouring out. The first thing I did was spend $200 on all 
new tires. Then I spent $30 on a 6 V coil and $60 on a battery. Then she said 
it needed a starter, that was another $130 (ouch) The muffler it had was full 
of rust holes, and needed a new one, the cheapest I found for a stale air 
type 2 was $172 at BFY. Then after trying the carb that was on it, then 
buying one from a friend that didn't work (another $40, but he gave it back 
to me) I had to buy a rebuild from BFY for $92. THEN CAME THE MECHANIC 
BILLS!!! It was $400 for new wiring that had been butchered, so the total 
cost to get the motor to turn over was $530. This did not include the brakes 
or the throttle and clutch cable. I know you are all thinking I should have 
done this myself, but I am only 19 and have never had to do any serious work 
on my previous VW's. To be on the safe side, I had the entire brake system 
replaced except for the drums. I got all new pads, master cylinder and metal 
brake lines for $467. Then when they finally went to test-drive it, it would 
not go into a single gear. This meant that the motor had to be pulled and it 
was another $200 for the throttle and clutch cables, and a new clutch. The 
only thing that is not stock is the return spring. he had to rig something 
like the original out of spare parts, so if anybody know how to get on for a 
36hp I'd like to hear from you. 
    After about 2 years, and a couple thousand dollars, he gave me a call on 
Friday and said &quot;Come get this thing outta' here.&quot;I was stuck at work and had 
to wait all holiday weekend to finally get it this morning. It took a lot to 
hold back the emotions as I first let that clutch out and felt her roll for 
the first time. I can't explain the joy I felt driving it home. Luckily my 
parents are cops because the bus has no plates, is off the books, and none of 
the electrical is hooked up. The headlight buckets aren't even there. 
Needless to say they followed me home. At the Pomona show in July, I bought 
the '56 plates and a '58 sticker for $75. So now I have to hurry up and wait 
at the Dmv to get that baby street legal. 
    Now that it is in my driveway again, I can't wait to get the interior in 
and start piecing her together. This is my third time on the list, but the 
last 2 times I didn't actually drive a bus, so I couldn't ask for much help, 
and could never offer advice, I can't wait to start hearing from you and 
especially to being able to offer my own advice from experience. If you made 
it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my story!!! :-)

What I have:
+Westy kit including the table, z bed, closet, sink, children's cot, and 
curtain rods. 
+both bumpers   
+original, but cracked taillights
+most the glass

What I need:
+Rear bumper brackets
+the 2 popout windows in back
+a rear apron
+all new rubber and seals
+all the handles, in and out
+new speedo, needle broken and not hooked up
+wipers (can put off though)
+ANY ADVICE OR HELP ON HOW TO GET THESE PARTS!!!

I also have 2 extra drums that my mechanic said are good and worth money. If 
anybody has any of these parts, I would be willing to make a trade, since I 
am more interested in parts than money for it... THANKS AGAIN  :-)
