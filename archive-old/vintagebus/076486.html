Subject: Reverse grinding

I accidentally posted this to the wrong list, but received some good
advice anyway.  Any other thoughts from the correct audience?
I recently purchased my '64 and I cannot get it into reverse when it's
cold (without major grinding).  After driving for at least 15 minutes I
can work reverse, if I'm really careful.  Warm up in the driveway
doesn't help.  I had a local mechanic (VW spec.) look at it, and he felt
that both the clutch and the trans were in good shape.  The only clue he
offered was that the clutch lever is longer than stock.  I have replaced
the clutch cable and adjusted properly.  Clutch does not slip.  Trans
does not pop out of any gears.  Anyone have any ideas?
 
Other than this, loving my bus.  It's a trade-up (for me) from my
previous '71 Westi.
Thanks,
