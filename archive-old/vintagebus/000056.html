Hi Jim and NQ,
Actually you have the case machined for a lesser thickness in the #1 main 
bearing area to remove the damaged case material that would allow a STD 
bearing to move too much front to rear.  Then with this new thickness you 
either by a new set of bearings with #1 bearing having the same thrust 
measurement as the case and/or to save case material here for future rebuilds 
you have the new #1 bearing also machined since they are not produced in 
.005&quot; increaments.
  No way do you want to just use thicker thrust washers.  Eric&amp;Barb
