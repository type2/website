&lt;&lt; My thoughts are that the 6V flasher was never changed.   &gt;&gt;

Hi Jim,
First get the lead out and make sure all your lights are 12 volt or risk 
melting original parts and lenses!

&lt;&lt;  Where is the flasher located in the bus? &gt;&gt;

Uner the package tray in front of the driver kick panel.  If your blinker 
indicator on the dash just freezes on when the signals fail your blinker 
problem could easily be a need for ground wires to each tail light bulb 
holder and to the battery ground strap.  Otherwise in any pre-1970ish bus you 
just have lousey dimly flickering tail light signals that are near impossible 
to see at night, and due to the running lights camoflaging the signals rest 
of the way to oblivion you get rear ended!
