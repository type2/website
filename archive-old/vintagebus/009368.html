well i really didnt want to be so negative about the whole thing, but im
bummed about the mirrors, and the not getting quotes or a catalog and all
that, in the meantime i did some research in the archives and well it seems
like alot of people have had similar experiences with them, so lets just say
that situations like these
really seperate the     boys    from the men,  or we could say the   boys
are back in town, or maybe    boys   will be    boys, or     boy    im glad
i didnt order anything else, or how bout..............well i guess thats
enough

&gt; I for one would like to know who the supplier is that you bought them
&gt; from.
&gt; Companies that are only interested in a customers money and nothing else
&gt; can suck my...
&gt; If you let the list in on the supplier...maybe we can all gang up on them!
&gt; later
