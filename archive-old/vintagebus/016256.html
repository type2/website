Sure thing... I suggest that you all buy it for my
relatively reasonable price and hack it any way y'all
want. You can then make the profits. Same with the
suggestion that &quot;let old so and so sell it for you. He
can sell anything...&quot; Let old what's his name hook up
his clients and he can take that profit as well.
Emailed this person and magically havent heard back as
of yet. Hmmm...
In the meantime I seriously have a baby and a
liberated unemployed wife to support. Next subject.
