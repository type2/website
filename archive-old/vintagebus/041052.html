Subject: Stereo Installation 8-track to CD  -  theft deterrent

Someone recently asked about stereo installation so I thought I would reveal
how I did it in my 63. I started off getting an under dash Pioneer Super
tuner 8-track tape player. You remember the ones with the big round dial.
Anyway their was one small hole in my tray along the passenger side. Not
knowing what the hole was for and not wanting to drill any more holes. I
decided to bolt the under dash bracket down with only one bolt. This was
fine because the lip of the tray kept it from moving.
The novelty of the 8-track was pretty cool for a while, hell I even went so
far as finding a guy that still could record to 8-track and had him make me
up some tapes. Though about 9 months later the tape player quit working and
within another week or two the radio faded out.

So after this I took the radio out. I decided to gut the radio and make it
into a case that would hide a CD player. These old 8-tracks have wider and
taller bodies then our newer DIN chassis radios.
To do this I unscrewed the box and removed the tape mechanism and tuner
portion. Next I took the faceplate with all the metal parts that were
extruding from the inside and spread epoxy into bottom edges of the parts. I
then took the plate over to my band saw and cut all the parts off flat at
the edge of the face plate. The epoxy kept things from springing out and
flying all over when cutting. Once this was done I positioned the tape door
closed and filled the back of the faceplate with polyester filler (bondo).
This was to fill in the cavities in the cut parts and to create a flat
finished surface when the face plate is open.

Next I took a couple of small hinges and attached the faceplate back to the
body case (from the under side)
Now the 8-track box was complete. To put the CD player in, all I did was
measure the height and width of the new radio verses the 8-track tape box
and cut two square wood spacers for it, I finished the one that would be up
front in black vinyl. I then slipped the cd player inside the spacers and
placed it in the 8-track box. All that was left was to bolt it back together
and hang it back in the bus.

Now I have a nice stereo that looks like an old 8-track that no one wants to
steal.
If anyone wants pictures I will send / post some
