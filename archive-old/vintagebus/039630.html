I FINALLY got my bus home this past weekend,I heard it run before I baught 
it,It had a really strange sounding knock but I wanted the bus anyway.Well 
ten months later its finally in my garage.I put a battery in it and turned 
it over just to hear it again and still couldnt figure it out.I pulled the 
motor last night to find all kinds of nice suprises! It had been converted 
to 12 volt, but the bell housing hadnt been clearanced very well,if at 
all.The fly wheel is kinda chewed up also.this thing had a ton of end play 
on the crank,I pulled the fly wheel to find the gland nut to be torqued to 
about 30 pounds!The thing is,the motor sounded really strong other than the 
knock,no smoke or anything like that.Do you guys think its still ok? I 
figure the fact that it was hitting the bell housing and had a loose fly 
wheel pretty well accounts for the noise so........
                                                         TIA,Carl
