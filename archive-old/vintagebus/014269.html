	NQ.

	Listen to every one here on the list. Don't do any thing you'll be sorry
for later. This is the time of the year that most all prodjects get put
on hold. Sh*t I don't even have time to clean the shop. What with
Christmas, banquets, partys, and what ever, theres no time for any VW
play. I'm looking at about 1 month min. just to finish getting parts for
my daughters car. Hang in there, take some time away from Daisy, and
enjoy the holidays.

	MARRY CHRISTMAS to you and your family from me and mine.
