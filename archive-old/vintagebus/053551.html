It should be working just fine.  It appears that calweb shut both the mail
and webserver sections of vintagebus_dot_com after they received notification
that we'd transfered the domain-instead of giving it a day or two for
cached dns records to expire.

By today, though, it should be fine again.

If all else fails, you can reach it at http://vb.icantclick_dot_org  which was
for temporary inhouse use to get the new site up and running.
