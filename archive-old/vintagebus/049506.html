Subject: Re: Rear wheel bearings 65 bus

A few days ago wuz writ:

&gt;The upper and lower inner bearings are 6306 with the C3 rating (hardness
&gt;or durability). the lower outer bearing is the N207E roller bearing, also
&gt;C3 rated, and the upper outer bearing is the 6305 also C3 rating.
&gt;



My mechanic-supply friend is looking in to getting me some of these
bearings wholesale, but he has a question: sealed or unsealed?
If they are supposed to be unsealed, would I gain anything (longer life,
less noise, etc) by using sealed? Would they not work?
Hmmm?Hmmm?

If his prices seem to get reeeeeallllll low with volume perhaps a list
buyis in order......
