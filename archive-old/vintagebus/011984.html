&gt; Anyway, I buy the bus and I get the kinks out of it, put on new rubber and brake shoes and start driving the dog piss out of it. It ain't got no radio and it goes really slow, so i cut a hole in the dash and install a Kenwood with big-*ss speakers (maybe a woofer pointed toward the road). But for about $400 in bus stuff and $600 in stereo stuff, I got me a satisfying ride and I get a lot of looks as I cruise through the neighborhoods deliverying pizza. Very acoustic if you get the amps up high enough.

Um, you wouldn't have a dash to cut a hole in...  Your best bet would be
to install an early two-fuse-block deluxe dash, then cut a hole in *that*
