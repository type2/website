&gt;Engine is a 1600dp, 009, 34 pict-3
&gt;
&gt;There's your problem right there

I'm going to have to politely disagree here.  I don't believe there is a
right or a wrong when it comes to dizzy selection.  It has more to do with
driving style than anything else.  I've driven VWs with both the centrifugal
advance and the vaccuum advance.  My biggest gripe is that the centrifugal
advance seems to tucker out once you get the RPM's to a point and then you
are almost forced to shift to have any power.  The 009 on the other hand
just keeps the power there for me whenever I need it.  I must admit though
that you can't beat the centrifugal advance for good solid grunt torque.
You can pop the clutch in first gear and not kill the engine with it.  Seems
the 009 works better for revving engines and if you knew how I drove - well
then, I rest my case. :-)  I suggest trying both and then go with the dizzy
you like best...
