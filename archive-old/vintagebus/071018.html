Subject: RE: [VB] blinker troubleshooting

Hi Don,

You may just need to pull the switch off, clean it up inside with some
good electrical cleaner and put it back.  You also may what to put a
little electrical grease in there to make things smooooth.  However, you
may find either a broken wire or the contact gone at which time you'll
want to find a new switch.  I believe the 65 switch will work.  Sometime
in there they went to the high/low beam switch in the ts switch but I
think that was later.

BTW, any of those relays you tried have the screw terminals?  If so,
don't throw them away as they can be fixed.  Also, if your bus has the
screw terminal electrical connections, you may also want to consider
swapping over the wire cabling so you can retain them and not have to
switch over to those nasty spade connectors.... or at least that's what
I did with the 59 dc...

Don asked:

&quot;I'm going through the electrical in the 60 dc I just brought home that 
I had stashed in my brother's yard (we've called a truce here at my 
house:)  and here is my first electrical question.

None of the blinkers worked.  Replaced with generic three prong, 
tightened some connections, and now have all but driver's rear blinking 
correctly.  Regular lights work, brake lights work only on passenger 
side though.  Checked 5 terminal strip, and found that indeed the wire 
entering it from switch and exiting to driver's bulb has no current.  
All others work fine.  So now I assume my troubles are in the switch, 
correct?  If so, what can I do once I take the switch apart to try and 
remedy this, and what should I leave alone?  In a pinch, Can  I swap 
the switch over from the '65 that is working fine?&quot;
