 Ok, I went and actually looked at my two engines.  The 1600 does not
 give any appearance of a washer, crush or otherwise, between the oil
 pressure switch and the case. &gt;&gt;

The type 2 senders I have seen have a cone shaped area above the threads.  
Instead of a crush washer the body of the sender seals against the engine 
case.  Do not overtighten because there is a casting line on the boss and 
they have been known to be weak areas and crack slightly and leak.
