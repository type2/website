I distrust such long URLs.  Let me know if it works for you.  Anway, this is
a Beck/Arnley part that sells for about $35.   You can see in the picture
that it was rebuilt by APRA, whoever that is.   The diaphram looks like it
was pried apart with screwdrivers and reassembled  by  paleolithic
ancestors.  Whatever.  As long as there's some new rubber in there, it might
work for me.
