Subject: No Brake Lights

Well Volks, my DC is now stopping fairly well.  But nobody but me
realizes it.  First a little back ground of what I have done on the past
coupla weeks:

I replaced my single master cylinder with a new dual 67 type.  I had a
few problems but with much thanks to you guys, all is well.

Now I have no brake lights.  I have tried putting the brake warning
light on the front and back of the master cylinder as well as swapping
the wires.  Still nada.  I have checked the fuses and swapped out most
for new.  Still nada.  I checked my bulbs and they both look good.  I
cleaned terminals and checked grounds but still....yup you guessed it,
nada.  Once I find my volt/ohm meter and long test wire, I will check
the long wire going from front to back but I don't think it's it.  Time
has taught me that when something goes wrong look at what you %&amp;#$_at_ with
last.  That would be the master cylinder.  I'm gonna go drink beer now
and ferget bout it till morning.  Hope ya'll are having a good weekend!
