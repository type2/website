1750 is just the starting bid.  I think it is way too much for this
bus.  I paid 1500, for mine.  1967 combi/camper no interior, except for
rear seat, no bumpers.  But it runs, have had it for two years now. 
Only major problem was an eletrical problem that couldn't be traced,
bought new wiring harness to fix.
