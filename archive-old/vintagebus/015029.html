Subject: cab door hinge pins
Date: Tue, 01 Feb 2000 03:10:22 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello listmembers,

In one of Bob Hoover's sermons, he advocates replacing the cab door  hinge 
pins with stainless steel pins.  Sounds like a good idea, anyone have a 
source for them?

Went to the junkyard today, pulled a front cab floor heat distributor (foot 
warmer) off of a '66 standard, I'm looking to graft it into my'64.  I got 
the tube behind, and the distributor.  The bentley says that its a pretty 
simple procedure, seems pretty straightforward to me.  Anybody done this?  
Words of wisdom for the inexperienced?

Thanks!
