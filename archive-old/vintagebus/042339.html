and the answer is:  it is the vacuum operated choke unloader!  To get it
out, you remove the plastic disc under the heating element and flip the
choke to a notch past wide open, then pull it out.  The alleged function
is to crack the choke plate a hair at full choke.  I sure do hope one
comes in the rebuild kit 'cuz nime is toast :-(

I will be adding pictures of the choke unloader removal to the carb site
soon.

Thanks to Andy Pechenik, Dave Jersey and especially JP Hendrikse!
