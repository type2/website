Subject: Deluxe trim removal...how?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Dear Fellow Bus Nuts

I am having a bus disassembly problem. I am deconstructing a '63 Deluxe
walk-thru in preparation for resto. On the back of the metal panels behind
the driver and front passenger seats there is an aluminum strip about six
inches up from the cargo area floor. The strip covers the bottom of the
interior panel that is pop-rivited onto the metal and the top of a rubber
covering. My question is...how does one remove those metal strips? Do they
pop off and if so what is the best way to do it without butchering them.
Thanks!

Stewart Alcorn

PS I'm having this sent CO Dawn.
