 I've got the same brochure and it too is marked VWOA 1963 is it a westfalia 
provided kit?  Anybody know the manufacturer &gt;&gt;

Hi Chuck,
It is another VOA approved dealer made conversion of the panel van into a 
camper.  Rivera was another of these made by a dealer in Oregon.  There were 
probably a hundred or more differant camper conversions for the panel van in 
N. America from the 50s through the 70s.   Eric&amp;Barb
