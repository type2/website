&gt; Listees,

&gt; I'm in south florida and I need tires. Does anyone know a dealer in this
&gt; area who has the Yokohamas or any other recommended tires for our beloved
&gt; but finicky buses?  I prefer to go to a place and have it done, rather
&gt; than mail/online order, as I don't have any facilities here to balance,
&gt; air up, mount tires.

Any Firestone dealer can get RD-603 Bridgestone tires.  They are stock
replacements on 1-ton toyota pickups, so they aren't all that hard to
find in the proper 185R14 size.  Firestone is owned by Bridgestone, but
Bridgestone doesn't use Firestone factories to make their tires.
