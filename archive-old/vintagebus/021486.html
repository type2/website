&lt;&lt; Wolfsburg West told me theirs are NOS, not repros.  That surprised me
 because the color is not exactly the same as one I took off a Commercial Bus
 at the junkyard.  They also said they were almost out of them?

From what I have been told (by Charlie Hammil), Primer hubcaps are different
colors, there are red ones and grey ones, and the grey ones are shaded to the
bus's color.
