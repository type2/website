Subject: Re: [VB] RE: car fire

 I highly recommend  a Halon extinguisher. I've had 2 engine fires and put 
them both
out quickly by having an extinguisher handy next to the drivers seat.  Two 
quick puffs
of that halon and that fire was out!  There was no mess except some smoke 
stain
to wipe off.  The second fire I used a white powder extinguisher. It put out 
the fire
but what a mess!  It looked like someone tossed 5 lbs of flour all over the 
engine.
Never again with that stuff!  Halon is expensive but you car is worth it. My 
first fire
started with the carb float springing a small pinhole leak, filling with gas 
and 
sinking down to the bottom of the bowl. This caused the float valve to stay 
open,
the bowl overflowed and the gas ignited. The second fire was a similar 
reason. The car hadn't been drivenfor several months, the full bowl dried out, the 
float sunk and
the float valve got stuck in open position. When I finally fired it up the 
float valve
stayed stuck in open position, the bowl overflowed with the resulting fire.
   Since then I have carried Halon extinguisher handy.  You will be glad you 
have it
when you have your first fire..............
