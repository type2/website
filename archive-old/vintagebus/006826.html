From what I understand copper will sweat and increase waterin the line,  PVC
is better or rigid pipe, also you can add a desicant water trap and then use
a inline water trap at the Gun. My compressor is a 5 HP 80 gal duel stage
compressor, I run at 125 PSI with 15 cfm and my compressor will keep up with
my blast cabinet with no problem.

Hello All....

I would rather be on the road to Jerome!  But here's a copy of the plea for
info/help that I might be sending to the autobodystore_dot_com BBS:  If anyone
has knowledge that they'd like to send to me, feel free!   TIA!

&gt;Situation!  Please Advise.

I'm setting myself up to paint cars (among other things).  I figure that if
I get the required equipment, I could paint/restore more than one....

I've got a serious water problem, however, and I don't know how to tell
if it will continue to thwart my efforts.

I am currently sandblasting, and I am noticing water spurts after about
20 minutes of continuous work.  Here is what I am using:

DeVilbiss 6.5hp/60gal compressor (10.5 cfm_at_90)
50 ft. of 1/2&quot; copper pipe ending in a loop with drain valve
DeVilbiss Regulator/Water trap/Filter (small...got it at Home Base..?)
50 ft. 1/2&quot; air hose
DeVilbiss disposable water/particle filter (I've gone through 3 so far..
...in less than a day!)
Campbell Hausfeld 30lb portable sandblaster

I am running at 90-100 psi using 30 mesh sand. (works great)
I will be painting using an &quot;Advantage&quot; HVLP gun with catalyzed primer
and single-stage urethane paint at 10 psi at the gun.  Using less air, do
you think that my water situation will go away?

BTW, the compressor is running almost constantly with the sandblaster.
I hope that this monster is not too wimpy to power a spray gun!
I am assuming that a sandblaster is very air-hungry.

Do I need to buy yet another water trap?  I am really getting poor, so
whatever I do, it's gotta be cheap!

I am already letting the petcock on the compressor tank bleed a bit
during operation.

Please check out the pictures at this site...I spent the day yesterday
putting up the 50ft of copper to get the trap away from the compressor
and to act as a condenser, but now I'm just getting frustrated.  Help!?

Thanks,

Gene
