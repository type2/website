Good question Barry.  An issue for the bus list to think about (in terms
of context) is that post modern thinkers are mostly french!  Gaby Schwab
is german(alive) and there are plenty of dead german thinkers who
fostered postmodernism, but as to the context of the List?  I'd say that
we should do theater, dance and song accompanied by bus exhaust to try
to deal with our century.  The context of the split window bus is in
some way clear to us but god knows what the world thinks.  We understand
the tacit waves from other bus drivers.  We communicate on incredible
levels  We known what we mean...
