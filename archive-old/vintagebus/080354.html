Subject: RE: [VB] Gas cap

Speaking of vapor lock, I'm going to make a short story long, or is it
the other way around?

Anyway, mid June I became a victim of out of school pranksters (why
can't school go 365?) and became the not to proud owner of half a litre
of water in my gas tank. I assumed it was gas station condensation at
first and kept my tools in the truck for when it quit, spare fuel
filters, carb, and fuel pump. It was a daily thing up until the 19th of
June and it was becoming too frustrating. This was way too much water to
have been service station condensation. Finall July 5th I drained the
gas tank and was flabbergassed at the amount of water in the drained
fuel. Thinking I got it all from jacking the truck up on each side to
tip the tank, I replaced the fuel filters (one inline and one to the
carb), and put on another carb. It seemed to run OK for a few miles and
then start the chugging again like it wasn't getting any fuel. I'd get
out and check the fuel filters for water and flick them a few times and
notice a siphoning up to the carb. After that it run fine to work. After
work I'd get to the two or three mile mark and have the same problem.
Long story, but I finally rubbed to brain cells together and thought
that this looks exactly like vapor lock. Having purchased a new gas cap
over a month ago at Ovals I decided to swap out the carb again to a
fresh rebuild off the shelf and change the gas cap. After the tune up it
seem to run just fine and I got to work without a hitch. We'll see if it
takes me home agin, but that looks like the problem, on top of
everything else!

I have a repro gas cap that if I run a seal in it I get vapour lock.

So I am after an original bus VW logo cap - I see a few of these at the
swapmeets, but they are never cheap - how can I tell that they are
definately split ones?

Is it possible to see the vented part or is it within the crimping?

Thanks
Paul
