Subject: Re: [VB] Fw: Big nut rear axle seal question

The only things you use in that kit are the two paper gaskets, small o ring and the seal that presses into the cover that goes over the bearings. 
I have been told by a respectable trans builder to never use the metal spacers in those kits, they are too thin and will not make a good seal on the bearings. 
make sure the spring is still on the pressed in seal and that all are torqued properly. The drum is what compacts the small o ring. Are your spring plates in good shape?
