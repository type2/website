Subject: Tilt reproductions

  For me, having the correct grommets and color are not 
worth another 200 bones and 3 months lead time. But then 
I'm not out to impress show judges/vintage Nazis either- 
I use my truck daily and to camp in. I had a hard enough 
time deciding to spend $550 on one (until I saw it on my 
truck)!
  Taught fit, good materials, and quality construction. 
stayed in place all weekend and the 4 hours/60-70mph 
home. I'm a happy customer and give Tom's DC tilt two 
thumbs up.

He is just doing the canvas. It's nice, and works, but 
it's not 100% original
looking. Wrong hardware, wrong colored grommets, and the 
wrong colored canvas.
But for $500 they be good to &quot;use&quot; If I was going to 
spend the money I'd buy one
from Dawn at PLF for a little more that was correct.
