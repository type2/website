ok, after much searching and help from the list, it appears as though it is
bascially impossible to get a 6v gauge(unless you get lucky and find one at a
swap meet, or use a mechanical one)

so now that i realize that i need an inverter of some sort, i went to jc
whitney and they have two different inverters to change from 6 to 12 volt.
high current and low current, price varies from 59.99 to 89.99.

what i would like to have hooked up is a oil temp gauge, oil press, and
tachometer....eventually i would like to hook up a stereo so i don't have to
use the little portable one i use now. i don't need ear popping sound, ut i
would like to be able to hear it while driving on the highway.

do i need a separate inverter for each device(definitely need to change what i
will try to install) which inverter should i get, and do you have suggestions
as to where to tap into the electrical system? I was planing on keeping the
stock radio(i like stock if i got it) and having a separate radio(not sure
where i am going ot install it yet) so i can listen to fm and cds during the
long trips...

thanks for any suggestions..
