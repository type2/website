Subject: Re: 65' brake system question

From: Tracy Bonin &lt;icculus22420_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Hi, I have a 65' Splitty that I'm restoring.

Wow!  That's a long Splitty.  Limousine?

&gt; The pedal just goes to the floor, and will stay there unless I flip it back up with my shoe or something.

There is a return spring that should cause the pedal to come back up even if there is no pressure in the system, so in addition to the other things that 
folks mentioned to check/replace, I would add that one.  Perhaps the pivot fot the lower half of the brake pedal lever is sticky.

IIRC, if you're getting no pedal and the fluid isn't pouring out somewhere, it's the master cylinder; else it will be a leak in the lines, hoses, or wheel 
cylinders somewhere.  Add some fluid and see where it goes.
