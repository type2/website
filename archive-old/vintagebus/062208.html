Subject: RE; [VB] Hoover Bit Update and DP 1600 engine tin question.....

Hi Scott,
On our Doghoused engines this seals completely.

&gt;&gt; Also, why does the back tin on the engine not fit tightly to the rear of 
the casearound the flywheel? My immediate guess is that this is not important 
askeeping the front engine tin tight to keep the exhaust heat out??Comments 
anyone....Scott'67 Westy  &lt;&lt;

The ones we have tried do fit the FW properly.  We do weld a engine screw 
mounting point on the left side of this forward tin to both help keep it in 
place and seal to the #3 cylinder tin better.
  We had a friend who got a bus that was midding the complete forward tin.  
We installed a oil temp gauge and a few weeks later pulled the engine and 
installed the forward tin piece.  She noticed a twenty degree drop in oil 
temp right away!
