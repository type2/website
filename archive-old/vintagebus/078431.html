Subject: Re: [VB] 1200 40hp case to 1600

Hi Paul,
The 40HP engine can be bored for 1500/1600 P&amp;Cs.  The biggest problem is 
wether or not your engine case is an early model or not.  Early ones have no 
replacable cam bearings, the case is the bearing surfaces.  These cases can be 
bored for replacable cam bearings, but finding a shop that can do this is getting 
harder and harder.  As for the rest of the internals you will have to replace 
the 64mm throw crank and install a 1500/1600 69mm crank.  Plus you will need 
1500/1600 heads.
  Personally we would leave the cylinder bores alone.  Buy a Scat cast CW 
64mm crank or perhaps one in the 70s mm one.  Then have a set of 40 HP rods 
machined for the crank and install 40 HP big bore P&amp;Cs.  This will give you at 
least a 1500cc engine and if you go to a longer throw even more this will increase 
not only your cc size but your torque even more.  Buses need more torque!
  Either way make sure to get your compression ratio down to 7.1:1 or less 
for dailly driving.
