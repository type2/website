&gt; If any one has any suggestions, or know of camp outs, shows, or junk
&gt; yards, or just wants to visit let us know.  We are planning to leave
&gt; around 4 July, or whenever the bus work is done, but we hope to have
&gt; some email connections enroute.  We have the AIRS lists with us and hope
&gt; not to have to use them except for non-emergency visits.
