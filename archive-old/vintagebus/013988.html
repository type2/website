Subject: [VB] Compaq TV ads featuring 23 window
Message-Id: &lt;199911141715.LAA24756_at_vpop.hypercon_dot_com&gt;

Has anyone seen the Compaq computer ads that prominently feature a 23
window?  I noticed them this weekend on a local Houston UHF sports &amp;
news channel.  I haven't watched one all the way through yet --- just
spotted them while the TV was on in the background as I was cooking &amp;
cleaning up the kitchen.

I think that there are at least two different ads.  The ads are for
Compaq's Presario line of computers.  There is a family with two or
three kids and parents in their forties, and they apparently have just
bought the 23 window, as well as a Compaq computer.  In one sequence
there is a segue to a CAD/CAM skeleton picture of the 23 window.

The 23 window itself is '61 or earlier, as you can clearly see the
pointed front turn signal lights.  There's a spare tire, without a 
hubcap, bolted to the front of the bus.  The color of the bus is rose 
pink --- I forget the official name for that color off the top of my 
head, but it was a genuine stock color.  The bus itself looks to be in 
excellent shape, but not necessarily a restoration.

I'll keep my eye out for more sightings, and let you know if I see this 
again.  This could be part of a national ad campaign, or it could be 
part of a test marketing plan --- Compaq's HQ is here in Houston, and 
I'd guess that the UHF station has lower advertising rates than the big 
network stations.

Cheers, Bill
