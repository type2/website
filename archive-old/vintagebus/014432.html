I was curious to see if anyone has seen a little oil baffle for a 36h.p. 
motor.
I tore the motor down this week, and under the generator there was a little 
ZIG ZAG shaped piece of metal that was inside there.
Purpose was to keep the oil from oming back up and seaping out through the 
seal under the generator. What goes down, will NOT come up.
Pretty neat, asked a bunch of the oldtimers from around here, none of them 
had ever seen anything ever like it.....
Anyone ever seen one?
Curious to see....it looks too well done to be homemade so Im sure there are 
others.....
