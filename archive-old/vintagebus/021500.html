&lt;&lt; Need some help.  I just bought a 65 split window and the person that had it
 before but a 1600cc engine in it.  The engine runs cherry but the starter is
 blown.  He said he has been through 3 starters.  I need to know what kind of
 starter to get.....also I heard that since the bus is 12 volt that I need to
 get a converter or something ?  Need some help....I'm totally lost.....  Thx
 fellas.....by tha way....this is my first VW
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
First you are going to have to remove the engine and figure what you have in
there.  6 volt or 12 volt, starter, flywheel, and what size is not only the
inner dia. of the bushing but what size is the outer dia.?     Eric &amp; Barb
