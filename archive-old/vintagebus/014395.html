Hello All,

Does anyone know of a source for information on Sapphire Radios.  
Specifically for a 67 westy. Assuming of course that it even came with one.  
I found a Sapphire III. It is a six volt and obviously too old. Anyone 
interested in it, give me a p-mail.  I also have a sapphire XVI and a couple 
of Sapphire XVs.  I might be able the find the correct one but I don't know 
what I'm looking for.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Boyd Smith
