&gt; Hello All
&gt; 
&gt;     I ask the list a few weeks back where I could get seat belts for my
&gt; 67 bus and I was told I could get them at Wolfsburg West. But I need to
&gt; know where to mount them in the Bus.


Eric,

In a '67 there should be holes in the floor just behind the middle seat
for that seat's seat belts. They're under the floor mat. They will
probably have plastic screws in them. You'll have to cut holes in the
mat to be able to use them. The back seat belt holes are on the front
edge of the engine compartment behind the seat bottom. The same plugs
will be in these holes. No need to cut anything to use them.

John
