Hi Gene,
Best to go through the clutch parts and measure what you have.  Start with 
the clutch cable.  Then measure the distance from the forward part of both of 
the engine case that the tranny seats against to the forward end of the 
clutch pressure plate on both engines.  Measure the clutch discs for 
thickness and maybe try switching the pressure plate to see if on of them are 
out of whack of the FW.
