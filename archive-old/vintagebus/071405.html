Subject: New Dash Tables are In

We now have an updated &quot;reproduction&quot; of the dash-mounted front tables
originally offered as an option on '74-79 Westfalias.   This table
mounts to the dash between your front seats, using supplied clips. While
it was stock on '74-79, it's useable on most VW years/models.  It can
mount to any vertical surface. This is a great add-on for camping, etc.,
making good use of otherwise unused space, yet more compact and easier
to store than the Vanagon Westy front table/arm arrangement. We got
these from Just Kampers in England, where they have been a runaway hit.

I put &quot;reproduction&quot; in quotes because, while the dimensions and
configuration are close to the original (except for an improved leg
design), the table is in gray laminate instead of the '70's dark
woodgrain vinyl of the original.  You can see a picture at

The price is $69.95, and the part number is A6770.   Website order link:
