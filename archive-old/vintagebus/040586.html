I helped a couple from WA heading for Baja and no they had not heard of the
list.  They got a printout from a guy in San Francisco.  None the less they
were very nice people and it made me feel good about helping them.

Just a question for everyone who has helped out someone.  Were they from the
list?  I've had 3 people contact me and I did some welding/fabrication for
one
and none had ever heard of the &quot;list&quot;.
