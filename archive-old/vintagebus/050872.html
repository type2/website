Subject: RE: [VB] Inside front door handles

64 did away with the pin as well as the icepick handles.  Unless of course
your like me, and have a 64 made in late 63.

&gt; 
&gt; What year did they switch from the roll pin attachment to the screw
&gt; through
&gt; the handle attachment??
&gt; 
&gt; My 62 has the mech. with the threaded mount, but someone took the older
&gt; handles and drilled a hole through them and bolted them on.  I want to put
&gt; the correct ones on.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
&gt; See ya tomorrow :-)
