&gt; What is the purpose of small lines in a brake system ???

Brake systems run very high pressure, but virtually no flow.  Small lines
can have thinner walls for the same pressure.

&gt;  &gt; Like George said, if you push X amount of oil into one end of the oil
&gt; line,
&gt; &gt; then the exact same amount of oil will come out the other side. Oil line
&gt; &gt; size does NOT change this.

&gt; &quot;What goes in must come out&quot;. Einstein ? Dr.Spock ?

Dr. Ruth?

&gt;  &gt; Now, the speed at which the oil travels through the oil line will change
&gt; &gt; with oil line size, but, regardless of oil line size, once the oil line
&gt; taps
&gt; &gt; back into the main galley, the oil speed is the same.

The only loss will be pressure, if the friction of the fluid passing
through the hose is too great.  The faster the fluid flow (in linear, not
volume, terms) the more the resistance.  Large lines decrease the linear
rate of flow.  That is why Porsche runs _really_ big lines to their
front-mounted oil coolers.
