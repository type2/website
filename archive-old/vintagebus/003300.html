Hi All,

I bought a (NOS?) set of euro head lights for my 59 double cab from Lars
Neuffer way back in September 2000 and they were missing one of the center
bars that go in front of the bulb and one of the springs that keeps tension
on the mirror.  The bar is about 6-7 inches long, with a 1 inch diameter
disk in the middle and spans from one side of the large mirror to the other.

I've tried repeatedly to get Lars to send me the replacement parts and he
has said he would in the past but that was back in January and I never can
get a response from him now.... anyone know if he's still alive?????

So, does anyone have one of these cross bars and possibly the spring?  If
needed, I can post a pic of the exact parts I need.

Thanks in advance


David
