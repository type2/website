&gt; Is there any way to electrically warm the water in a particular vessel?  I
&gt; have a harbor freight parts washer, which uses a water-based solition, and

&gt; 
&gt; Is there something you can immerse into it to do this?

any sealed heating element.  they make small versions for fish tanks, they
hang on the side of the tank....nothing more then a heating element, like
what is on an electric stove, sealed up.

if you want a homebrew, get a single burner electric hotplate, tear the
elemebt out, get the knob and all way back out of the way, seal the
electical connections where the wires attach to the element waterproof
(brush on electrical tape comes to mind, a helthy dose..) fab a hanger,
and insert.  the element itself shouldnt have a pproblem with the water.
do realize that if you turn this thing up a good bit it could likely burn
the side of the parts washer...;)  

i would probably try to be sure that the wire&gt;elment connections stayed
free of the water, but if the seal is good, you should have much trouble.
9maybe even seal the bastards in epoxy...)


the parts washer circulates, right?  then you should not ghave much
trouble with something like this.  just dont get it to hot.;)

all disclaimers apply, eh?  water and electricity to not mix under normal
conditions..;)

later...david
