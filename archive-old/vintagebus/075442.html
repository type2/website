&gt; My friend got a transmission that he was told came out
&gt; of a 69 bus.  I have a 1600 DP engine (12V) that I
&gt; wanted to test before installing, so I borrowed his
&gt; tranny and hooked the engine and starter up to it.
&gt; When I electrified the starter, I heard the solenoid
&gt; click out and the starter motor began to spin freely.
&gt; However, it did not engage the flywheel, so the engine
&gt; I looked closely at the tranny and the VW number on
&gt; the bell housing started with &quot;411&quot;
&gt; Anyone know anything about a tranny like this? Is it
&gt; something other than bus? Maybe Type 3 or late bus??

sounds like an auto tranny bell housing from a type 411 VW.  needs a
different starter, auto tranny starters have no nose bearing
