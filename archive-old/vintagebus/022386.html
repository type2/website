Subject: Bentley pages and carb adapter
Mime-Version: 1.0

I know this is kinda frowned on, but we just bought my wife a 1970 bug
convertible. (I made her a convert!) It came with a new canvas top, and a
bunch of new bowes. The top is off of it and will need to be fully
installed. Is there anyone out there on the list who's got a Bentley shop
manual for a 1970 era bug? I need a copy of the pages covering the
convertible top. Anyone game tp photocopy, scan, or fax them for me? pmail me.

Bus Content: Has anyone used one of those carb adapters that lets you run a
single port carb on a double port engine? I'd like to use a 30-Pict 1 on my
1600cc double port instead of the 34-Pict that's on it. Thanks for any info.
