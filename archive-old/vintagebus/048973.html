Hey listees,

     Extremely nice Type 2 swamp cooler accessory for sale.  This cooler is very nice---no dents, no dings, no scratches.  Since bus windows slide from side to side this cooler attaches to the rain gutter on top of the bus and vents ice cold air into the cab.  This swamp cooler looks brand new and was manufactured during the early 50's.  Very cool accessory and I have never seen one before on a Type II.  Price---$375.00.  Thanks.

Greg
