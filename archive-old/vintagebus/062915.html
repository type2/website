Subject: Totaled Bay

  Today I went to the Grand Canyon to rescue a bus that hit an ELK. When the
owner called and asked if I would go get it I said sure. I was told that she
had just hit it (the ELK), but upon picking it up she not only hit the 500
lb. buck but rolled her bus also. Wait till I post pics. It's amazing that
she came out OK, I would have thought someone would have died in the
collision. Just goes to show that our buses can hold there own against some
big old buck.

ronnie  pics will be posted on the planet shortley in the gallery

ps. The elk died but was picked up imediatley by some hunters to butcher. 1
gone bus, 1 freezer full of meat.
