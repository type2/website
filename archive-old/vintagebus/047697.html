&lt;&lt;What kind of undercoating is it?  I'm not aware of any &quot;factory&quot;
undercoating (E&amp;B? C?)
&gt;&gt;

I don't think VW offered it...but dealerships would do anything to bill you 
an extra buck.
My 57 was coated EVERYWHERE underneath.....entire engine compartment too, 
gastank, rear of decklid, etc. etc........Ahhhhh what a mess.
