&gt;Solution; well my soultion at least....I have now been semi-hemi cutting my
heads
&gt;per a Gene Berg cutter via my local Machine shop.  This semi-hemi cut will
bring
&gt;a stock 1600 sp or dual port down to around 7:0-1 compression.

I have found the same thing.  Last total engine rebuild I did, I had the
heads semi-hemied. They came out to about 60cc I believe.  No shims needed
with stock cylinders.  This was for my engine, always measure.
This was a single port as well and the intake fit fine.
One thing to take note of is that you can possibly increase your timing by
up to 4 degrees.  Apparently this is because of the way the flame travel is.
As I understand it the Porsche heads had this design and were allowed more
advanced timing.   The only thing that worries me about semi-hemi cutting is
that there is less of a heat dam in the heads, but I've never heard much bad
about it.
