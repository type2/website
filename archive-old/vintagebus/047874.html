&lt;&lt; A question of inexperience... My oil temp guage is reading about 120. This 
 is after about 20-25minutes of running.  I know that the sensor may be off 
 caliber but I don't want to drain all my oil just to find out. I've got a 
 print out of how to adjust the bellows but I'm having trouble understanding 
 them. I don't know where the &quot;flaps&quot; are that the article talks about. Could 
 anything else be causing a low oil temp? Do i need to run it longer to 
 really tell if there is a problem? Any advice? I've checked the library but 
 no real answeres. Thanks for any help in advance.

thermostat, assuming you have a 1600 style upright motor, the flaps are in 
the fan housing, on each side.  you cxan see the sheet metal screws attaching 
them from looking in the engine compartment, kinda just forward of the intake 
manifold.  If you reach around in front of the fan housing reach to the 
bottom, if there is a metal bar across from side to side that is the 
horizontal linkage for you thermostat flaps,

look under the motor at the right hands side - see how the tin under the 
motor has two parts, and one part is a square you undo 4 screws (if all 
there) and remove.  ABove that = look-   there may be a bracket bolted to the 
engine case with an accordian shaped thing with a rod sticking out the top of 
it and going up towards the fan housing.  

if you dont see this stuff, but just a threaded stud sticking out of the 
case, you have no thermostat.  sometimes some of the stuff is there, and you 
may have the bracket and theermost, but no vertical rod, or the flaps and 
vertical rod may be there, but no bracket or thermostat.  

IThe accordian shaped thing is the thermostat.  When cold (under 65-70 C) it 
should be all contracted, when above that temp it expands, and thus the rod 
in its head goes up, which being attached to a flange on the air direction 
flap,  opens the flaps in the fan housing on the right side which activates 
the connector over to the left side and opens them too.  

If it is expanded when cold, it is bad, kaput, no good.

the flaps in the fan housing are almost completely closed when the thermostat 
in shut.   thus the air from the fan goes through the fresh air tubes, (and 
oil cooler if doghouse, though the oil is not circulating through the oil 
cooler at this point due to the oil pressure relief system).  As the heads 
and cylinders are really not getting much cooling air, the engine warms up 
more quickly, and when the thermostat gets warm enough, it opens, which opens 
the flaps and lets cooling air go over the heads and cylinders.  when it 
cools too much, the spring attached to the vertical linkage helps pull the 
flaps closed again.

this is really a sinple effective,  and elegant system.  One thing is that 
sometimes putting around town in winter my thermostat never opens, but the 
engine is warmer and  thus heat is better.  also think- you do get bigger 
heat VOLUME when thermostat is closed. Defogs windsheilds very fast.

you adjust the thermostat by removing that square piece of tin under it, and 
loosening the 13 (14) mm nut holding the bracket, and moving the thermostat 
and tightening the nut down again.

there is also the tin that just has a hole for the bolt holding the 
thermostat to the bracket, and the tin w/o holes at all, that while less 
common, are really a PITA.

but i doubt that the thermostat would make your engine run 120 F.  In fact, 
it should make it get up to 65-70 C (149 - 158F) pretty fast.
