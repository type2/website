Subject: Re: [VB] didn't do so hot with kelly park

I have blown up about 3 of the cheap pulleys that you get aftermarket now a
days.  I now carry an NOS pulley that has the locking tabs, instead of the
cheap Double D cutout in the wheel (don't know what else to call the center
that fits to the generator, but it's flat on both sides).  Everytime I pull
an engine apart, I look for these Generator pulleys that have the two
locking tabs that lock the front pulley with the back pulley, and have only
found 3 in 10 years.  If you ever find these, keep em, they work great, and
don't strip/blow up, or at least none of mine have.

Later
Charles

&gt; Well, great trip there, uneventful.
&gt; Great show on Saturday.....lots of nice busses, nice people, great
&gt; atmosphere.
&gt; Nice bbq on Saturday (Thanks Roger!), sat in line Saturday night.....no
cops
&gt; even....
&gt; One of the first in the door at kelly park.
&gt; Trip home kinda blew, about 10 miles north of King City (260 miles from
&gt; home) I had the front inner generator pully come apart, no spare. =(
&gt; The nice gentlemen from Aussie stopped and dug through ALL their stuff
&gt; thinking they had one but no luck, he believes he sent the box with the
&gt; pully in the other car!
&gt; Towed it 60 miles to Paso Robles (Thanks AAA!) and stashed it in my
&gt; grandparents garage.
&gt; Guess I'll go grab it this next weekend.
&gt; Do people carry spare pullies? I would never have thought for this to
&gt; happen.
&gt; Hope everyone made it home alright, and had less troubles than me.
&gt; Greg
