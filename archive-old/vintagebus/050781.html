Subject: RE: [VB] throttle cable cuts trans

yes, there is a bowden tube available for this. i think it should be
readliy available, although i don't know the length.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; My throttle cable is ever so slowly sawing through my transmission
&gt; case. I think I can stop it with a piece of rubber fuel line, but why
&gt; is this happening?
&gt; In my bus the throttle cable emerges from its tube beneath the bus at
&gt; about the same area as the nose of the trans, then runs exposed (and
&gt; touching the trans in one spot) until it enters the short tube running
&gt; through the forwardmost piece of engine tin and the fan shroud. Am I
&gt; missing any pieces here, some kind of bowden tube or something? Was
&gt; there a housing over the exposed cable?
