&gt;I also had an idea for fixing rocker panels, at least under the doors. It
&gt;seems to me that, once fixed, this problem of rust is likley to reaccur
&gt;because water collects in this area. My idea is to use &quot;sign foam&quot;. It is
&gt;a material used in the sign industry. It can be carve with ease. By
&gt;making a cuved block of this stuff and epoxying it in, there would be no
&gt;place for moisture to collect, ever. I am still thinking about this one,
&gt;because I would like my bus to be as original as possible, but the idea
&gt;of curing this problem FOREVER may induce me to sacrifice my purist
&gt;leanings.
&gt;
It would be nearly impossible to fill every void completely, and the one you
missed would find the water. A guy in the bus club had a bus where someone
completely filled the rockers with expanding foam through the drain holes.
Complete and utter destruction. I would think a better idea would be to try
to get some kind of sealer all over in there and expand the drain holes.
Maybe open up the inner rocker at the bottom or something. Water and crud
will get in on top of there, it needs to be able to get out.
