I know that this is a bit of a generalization.. but..

my (limited) expereince with gas heaters is that they are expensive to fix and tempermental.

they have to be in top running order or i think they are a bit of a fire hazard.

i know people like ark mirvis and jb's heater service in colo (?) sells glow plugs etc. for them. (they advertise in hvw's)

gas heater parts are pretty $pendy..

imho it is simpler, cheaper and less strssful to put on a warm coat

up here by the time it is cold enough to warrant a gas heater usually means the salter truck is out onthe road  which means my bus is not!
