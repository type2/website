Subject: 21 vs 23 - which is more rare

(we interrupt the rocker/hippie bashing &amp; basher-bashing to bring you this important message)

I had this question posed to me, and the more I thought about it, the more interesting
it becomes.

Which is more rare: a 21-window or a 23-window?

Common sense would tend to dictate that the earlier the car, the rarer it is, 
and it's a good rule to go by.

But since 23's have always been more popular, they get restored
more often than 21's, which people frequently won't restore a 21 unless
they're in indecent condition to start with.   23's were made from
'51 to '62, so there's not as many years of production of 21's, but
those few years saw heavier production of all models.   

Later buses had a better chance of surviving just by being younger.

Also, here in the states, there was a trade war with Germany in the 60's,
which slowed down the importation of buses for a while; or did it?

Go to a show, and you're liable to see more 23's than 21's, but I think more 21's were made.

Anyone have hard-and-fast numbers to back up either argument?

The vintagebus_dot_com registry shows 143 51-62 and 181 63-67, 9 of undetermined year.
