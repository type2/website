Subject: swing lever bushing - musings

Hey everyone,

I'll just measure out everything when I get home tonight for a replacement 
center pin bushing.  Last night as I was working with it, I happened to 
glance at my new set of link pins and bearings, and a thought struck me.  
Has anyone ever thought of engineering a set up to put a set of needle 
bearings into the swing lever instead of the bushing?  I'm not sure if there 
would be enough clearance between the pin and the mount on the beam to fit a 
needle bearing.  The bearings for the link pins are a smaller diameter, and 
thus wouldn't work, but cracking out a bearing catalog, maybe I could find 
one that would work. One of my wonders is if the surfaces the bearings would 
roll on would need to be hardened (i.e. the pin, and the indide of the mount 
hole on the beam).  If not, then it's just a question of finding a bearing 
that would fit.  Oh, then you would need to have some way to seal the 
bearings up.  Hmm, this is getting complicated.  Anyway, just thinking out 
loud....

Mike A.
