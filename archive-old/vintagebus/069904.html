&gt;Is it okay to just grease the rod and the bushes and fit it, or should I 
&gt;put something else into the tube to prevent rust and keep shifting slick?

Last night I started working on my '59 Truck again (after like 8 months or 
something). I left it with the main shiftrod rusted and broke off in the 
shiftrod tube. By rusted I mean it's &quot;rust-welded&quot; TO the shiftrod tube. It 
broke off right around there when I tried to remove it. Most of the 
shiftrod is still in there and I've gotta figure a way to get it broke 
loose at the rusted spot.

I tried using penetrating oil and it didn't budge. I also used phosphoric 
acid and it still hasn't budged. I left it at that point hoping maybe some 
of those chemicals will break it loose.

Regardless the tube definatly has rust on the inside. I'm wondering what 
I'm gonna do to clean it out. What to do to prevent the rusty inside of the 
tube from getting worse. At this point the tube appears to be very much 
intact. I'd like to keep it that way.

So....any suggestions on how to deal with THESE problems?

p.s. The problem of locating a replacement shiftrod was solved by Greg S. 
of Elgin Tx.
Thanks Greg for letting me swipe the shiftrod off that parts bus!!!
