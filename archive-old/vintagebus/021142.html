Subject: Re: [VB] AN INTERACTIVE VINTAGE BUS EMAIL!

1.)  13 years old.  Neighbors across the street had a green '66 that just
sat parked.  We used to pretend we were driving in it.  

2.)  Car - '71 Plymouth Duster,   VW - '75 Dasher.   Bus - '61 15 window
Deluxe

3.)  Both my busses run!   '62 Mouse Grey Standard daily driver and the
above '61, running, but awaiting resto

4.)  My favorite is '61 or earlier 15 window Deluxes.  I think the look
is very clean without the skylights.

5.)  Stock for me, unless it's an engine or tranny.  Like the stock look,
the feel of custom.

6.)  Only if he tried to melt my brain.  Otherwise I'd tour him in my
bus.
