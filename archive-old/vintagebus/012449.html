   I just crawed out from under my bus, no switch on the trans or no wires
so I looked under the dash
and sure enough there's a funky looking switch attached to the speedo
cable.The wheels aren't on the
bus so I hooked my cordless drill to the cable, turned the key on put it in
reverse and there you go
lights!!! The only problem was the drill must have been to fast because it
burnt out the brand new bulbs
                                                                           
                                                             jim
