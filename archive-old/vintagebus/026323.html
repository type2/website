Looking for some tips out there.  I tried to assemble the upper door
frame for my bus last weekend.  I have done this many times before, but
not with this much trouble.  Anyone have any tricks for seating the
upper window frame into the door?  I am having trouble getting the
rubber mid seal to seperate so the frame can seat to the door.  I have
all the correct cutouts in the seal and all the hardware in in good
shape.  Nothing is bend and these are the frames that came off the
doors.

Thanks
Matthew
