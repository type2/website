Subject: Re: [VB] 6 or 12 volt tranny?

Hello Guys   The easy way to check is to stick a 12 volt flywheel up in there 
and see if it  hits. also use a new 12 volt stater bushing to check the fit 
at the bushing.I mount the flywheel to an old crank to help check the flywheel 
clearance in the bellhousing saves time and troubles. Just heard of someone 
having problems with a motor turning in a fresh painted 21 window that tried to 
drag the bus to get started and wrecked it in the process. Live and learn   
Later and have fun   Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va  540 389 8587
