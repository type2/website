Nobody was born knowing bodywork.  Nobody.

Here's my suggestions:

* Buy a book on the subject.  There are lots of them out there, and there's
even one that *specifically* deals with VW bodywork, although it's not
bus-specific.  (Maybe I should write one some day? Hah!)

* Start small.  Pick a small ding or dent, work it thru.  Just focus on
that one small area, forget that the rest of the bus exists.  

* When you get more confident, bust into something that requires welding.
Patch the battery tray or front floor - something that takes some work, but
the end-apparance isn't all that significant.

* When you get those done, try patching a rust hole or two in the body.
Start with a small spot before you tackle something like a rocker.

* Move onto the big jobs, like rockers, or sectioning portions of a door.

* Take your time (this is my biggest weakness) - don't get in a hurry.

* Buy the right tool at the right time.  Buy good tools.  Don't go to HF on
an tool-buying spree; you'll probably end up with the wrong stuff.

* Be creative.  Think the problem thru, and come up with different ways to
get the job accomplished, then pick the one you're most comfy with.

* Don't be afraid to screw up.  Anything is reversible.  

* Post questions to the list as you go along.

* Take lotsa pix.  Get them developed frequently.  They'll inspire you
later when you get to a tougher section, because they'll show you what you
started with, and what you've accomplished.

* Don't bite off more than you can chew at one time - divide the bus into
small sections and do one section at a time.  

* Take an area, do the cutting/bending/welding, then do some rough
bodywork, then move on to the next section.  Then you can do all your
finish bodywork at the same time, and not re-do work.
