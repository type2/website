Subject: RE: Wiring harness or what I did over my thanksgiving holiday

Congratulations on the new harness, Mr Dodson! Takes a brave man to jump into
that snakes nest!  I also have a ' 63 bus, a deluxe. I'd love to have a new,
correct,
color coded harness. Trouble shooting a harness thats 41 years distant from
the
correct configuration (color wise) is no fun as you've no doubt learned.
Some of the things that keeps me from jumping into that project are the
modifications
to the electric system over the years that (I think) would compound the
difficulty. For example
some years ago the bus was wired for the nine pin box / emergency light
relay.
The one called out in the ' 63 - ' 67 BENTLEY, section E-13 page 3.
(My bus has been up-graded to 12 volt.)

One thing concerning that &quot;big&quot; hazard light-------
&gt; the ' 64 has a big light on the left side of the dash for the hazard light.
&gt; my ' 64 (November ' 63 production) has it. I think this officially didn't
start untill August 1963,
&gt; but that was at 1 144 303, only about 11 days production after your bus.

My bus,  1 062 827   with a production date of 31 January 1963 has the same
light on the left side
of the dash.
Hhmmmmm. To paraphrase the famous Mr Muir from the idiot book....is this a
&quot;first water mystery&quot;?

One last question. What is this DOLIWA that was referred to several times? I
assume it's a production
list or progressive refinements for the bus?  Is this something a everyday
person like myself might be able
to purchase or is this one of the &quot;holy grails&quot; that one must give-up their
first born to Volkswagen to access? :-)

Anyway, nice going on the harness!!
