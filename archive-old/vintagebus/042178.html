&gt; Both cars take the same grade of gas at $2 a gallon 

Just for fun, I looked up another high mileage car:

VW Golf TDI:  42 city, 49 highway, 45 combined, MSRP $16745

For four grand less than the Prius you get virtually the same mileage.
Diesel is also a bit less here at the moment than gasoline.
Also, I doubt that VW is selling the TDI at a loss like Toyota is the
Prius!

Plus, the TDI would get along better with my bus!  :)
