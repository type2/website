&gt;What is a fair price for a good set of the 15&quot; wheels (unrestored but in
decent shape)? &lt;
$5 each at a junkyard from my experiences....  Sometimes with a decent tire
as a bonus.  Usually I give the decent tire to the used tire shop that yanks
the tire off when I redo the wheel as common courtesy.
I say give 'em away to a needy soul, and keep the good karma.
