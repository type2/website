&gt; The book shows this is a 65-67 engine case but the dual relief is

&gt; case was originally a 1300 for a 66 bug.  Looks like they were dual
&gt; relief # F 1 778 164 to F2 200 000, before that they were single relief.

I used to have a 40hp engine that had a dual relief case. It was a later
model replacement engine that was bought at the VW dealer. I had the
paperwork that showed all that when I owned the car. It was just a bug,
though, so I sold it 8^). Maybe that's what this one is.



&gt; Has anyone replaced the stock oil relief valve plain plunger with a type
&gt; 3 angular grooved type plunger to get 15deg lower oil temperature (by
&gt; increasing flow through the cooler)? (Discouraged by the VW factory
&gt; according to the Chilton 49-71 VW guide)

Don't mess with your plungers. There's no free lunch. If you could get
15 deg cooler oil that easy, then VW would have done it.
