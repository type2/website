Well here goes (donning fire proof britches),,NO-ONE that i have found makes 
a panel or part that fits perfect ,,not even some of the NOS panels that i 
have worked with go in with out tweaking or the used stuff ,,each bus is a 
bit different even with used and old stock stuff ,,,,,Wolfsburg has pretty 
good stuff but all have there good and bad points ,,i don't have time at the 
moment but i'll try and post a page with the sheet metal parts i use and like 
the best if that helps and anyone really cares that is ,hopefully i can do 
that in the next couple weeks ,,i use WW rockers most of the time inners and 
outters both sides ,,outriggers and inner nose sections and rear corner 
bottoms ,,Alan makes a great tall rocker for the drivers side if you need it 
a bit short on the rear end but i can deal with that ,,RMMW outriggers suck 
,,anything else i will use and thier heater tube sections are a waste of 
money huge pipe looks like crap ,,dog legs your on your own ,,no -ones fit 
alan's included ,,but if you work with them you can make they fit ,,not easy 
but can be done (PITA),,note ,,side post sections ,front post sections on 
drivers side inner ,close outs area behind the front wheel and at the rear 
wheels ,old style rear wheel wells(sections to fix cut outs for big tires  
,lower outter valance area and lower section of nose ,,,,i fab all these to 
fit the bus i'm working on as i need them ,,i'm working on some more parts 
and stuff i may even start supplying after i get the jigs made and tweaked 
,,some are the above parts ,and then some not mentioned still in thinking and 
planning stage,,,As for Alan Schofield,,his parts used to be great ,,but 
,,the last jack points i recieved were brazilan with vw stickers on them 
,,not the fabbed ones he used to sell ,,i can modify WW jack point to that 
quality and savebucks ,,( the fabbed ones were great ),,,thats my opnion and 
mine only ,,its your call not mine ,,i can work with most anything i get my 
hands on ,,oh on the inner nose section of Alan's ,,good thick steel ,,,to 
damn many parts,,and don't resemble the old ones ,,i don't use them period 
,,,ask NPBUSGUY_at_aol_dot_com what i said about those things ,,i can't spell the 
cuss words ,,Grin,,l ,,i really don't mean to put down anyones stuff ,,but i 
have my prefs ,,and you asked ,,so i'm just redneck enough to tell you what i 
think ,,,,
