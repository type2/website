&gt; The &quot;usual suspects&quot; for goop include 3M, Permatex, and Loctite.
&gt; Digging around, it looks like &quot;3M Scotch-Grip Rubber &amp; Gasket Adhesive
&gt; 847 - 847-L - 847-H&quot; might be a good candidate, but it doesn't come in a
&gt; spray can...

The problem here is that most of the goops are adhesives.  This
translates to &quot;a bear to remove and clean the next time&quot; which leads to
more leaks.  Better to use a non-adhesive goop when the goal is simply to
help a gasket seal.
