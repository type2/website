Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to open pop outs

Hey that's a good idea!  I don't think it was my advice, though.   I recently 
put a new outer seal on the popout in the closet of my westy.   I never open 
the closet window anyway.   I am waiting till cooler weather to replace other 
scrapers.

&lt;&lt; Clara,
  Have you forgotten your own excellent advice? Talcum 
 powder your window and door seals.

 &gt; Do you have new outer scrapers?  The ones over here also stick the window 
 &gt; closed.  I hear that in about a year they become easier to open.  If it 
isn't 
 &gt; the seals, you can try adjusting the pop out latch, where it attaches to 
the 
 &gt; pop out frame.

 &gt; &lt;&lt; My pop outs are very hard to open. I have spoken with a lot of other 
people
 &gt;  in the UK and most others have the same problem but noone has a perfect
 &gt;  solution to fix it. &gt;&gt;
