 &quot;Wouldn't 59 euro taillights be the same as US-spec by that time?&quot;
 
 yep... but with the amber turns. (on the top)
 but, dont get 'em from Cali Imports, their repops are s#it!
 just my $.02.
  &gt;&gt;
the round red glass version was used then.   The 62 on oval plastic 
tailalights have euro/US versions, and so do the taillights for the brake 
light decklid buses, but the mid 57 through 61 are just the round red glass 
where ever they were sold, except if you are in Australia, where you get and 
other round glass taillight, amber fo rthe turn signal if I got it right.   I 
saw this really neat book at Banres and Nobles called VWs orf the world, 
written by some British guy who had traveled a lot all over and took pics of 
VWs in many countries.  It covers bug and rabbits etc, not just buses, but is 
really nifty.
