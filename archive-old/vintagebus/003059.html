When I got keys made for my deluxe, I just took the code to the locksmith,
and they looked it up in a book, and made me a set of keys right there on
the spot.
The only problem I had was that they didn't have the correct key blanks, so
I ended up going to every VW dealer in St. Louis and digging through boxes
of blanks all day.  Not that I am complaining or anything!

It is also fairly simple to re-key the locks to fit whatever key you may
have..

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
