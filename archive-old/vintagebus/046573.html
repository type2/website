Subject: Re: [VB] fixing tires on the road
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I carry two tyre fixing tools with me.
The first is the fix-a-flat-in-a-bottle aerosol can, and it generally works 
great. It will get you from some awkward place to where you can remove the 
tyre to work on it.
The second is a tubeless hole plugger.
That consists of a circular rat-tailed file tool for roughing the area where 
the nail penetrated your tyre.
Having cleaned it up there is a tool that inserts a rubber string thingy.
I have used both of these on the road with great success and carry a foot 
pump and a 12 volt compressor to re-inflate the tyre.
