&gt;Well we thought of that also.  The main thing that is not going keep the
rust
&gt;away is the plastic against the sheet metal.  This will keep the moisture

That was what I was afraid of.  Although it appears to be one step better
than raw insulation against sheetmetal, it still apparently doesn't cure the
rust problem.

&gt;to cut and shave styrofoam panels to fit the areas in the cargo walls and
even
&gt;ceiling.  Plus paneling blueprints to cover the insulation.  This and using
&gt;tar to coat the sheet metal first should do the trick without rusting.  We
are


I work at a lumber yard and we carry Owens Corning and Dow Foam insulation
board.  We carry it in sizes 1/2&quot;, 3/4&quot;, 1&quot;, 1.5&quot;, and 2&quot;.  I assume this
would better than the polystyrene variety which is inherently more messy
than Dow Foam board.

I do have an observation here to make though.  If moisture will condense on
whatever you put in the walls of the VW, then what would make Dynamat, Dow
Foam, Plastic, Insulation, any better/any worse than the other material?  If
you must indeed use a tar coating, then why wouldn't it work to use tar and
then use my idea of insulation in sealed plastic bags?  The tar doesn't know
or care what it's being applied to or what is being stuck on it.

It appears to me that using tar to apply plastic bags full of insulation
would work, but due to settling and the awkward unstiff nature of an
insulation-stuffed bag, it would make dow foam board more practical if not
just plain simpler to work with.  Am I getting this right?

This all brings to mind several questions - who is actually going to
volunteer to slather tar on the inside panels of their VW?  Is tar the best
solution to this?  How do companies like Dynamat get by with using their
product without causing rust?  What do manufactuer's on today's auto
manufacturing front lines use to accomplish what we're trying to do?  Could
we accomplish the same thing by applying styrofoam to the interior panels
rather than to the sheet metal?

I know this has all been hashed before but I think the result ended up being
applying something right to the sheetmetal.  I hope I'm not coming across as
flame bait.  I have a sincere interest in wanting to insulate my vehicles
while battling one of my worst enemies - rust.

Thanks for the help all.
