Kris and List:

I've been researching this exact same issue.  What I have found now on numerous original buses and have been told by several *knowledgeable* VW people is this:

The underneath color of a bus is the exterior color of the bus.  Granted, it is over a grey primer.  On two tone buses I've been told that the undercarriage is the LOWER color of the bus, but I've personally seen it both ways.  Go figure.  My *new* '59 Deluxe is Sealing Wax Red over Grey Beige, yet the chassis is Sealing Wax Red.

I'm getting ready to spray the underside of the Light Grey (L345) '65 Double Cab Light Grey, easy since it's one color.  I'm going to paint the front beam, steering box, etc. black.  Whether it's absolutely correct or not doesn't matter much anymore to me.  It'll be close enough and look great.

Robert
