Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-06-03

Feels like i've been to hell and back....let me exlpain.

I hadn't done much with the Double Cab this last week. Mainly I've 
been organizing my storage house with some new shelves I aquired. I 
brought in my stash from the attic at the shop out on the ranch. I 
was amazed to find things I forgot I had. Everythings nice and 
organized in boxes on the shelves now and I can more or less find 
stuff when I want to.

So I got up yesterday morning and started to install the emergency 
brake and speedo cables I got earlier in the week from Ronnie.

The speedo cable went in without too much trouble. I fount that the 
little hub cover thing was missing on the drum, so I grabbed one out 
of my nice organized parts house. I picked up a little clip from the 
hardware store to hold the cable in place and was done.

  I decided against springing for the 1 year only brake cables at 
fourty something a pop, and got the later $8.00 ones. I had been told 
that other folks run them and just fab up some kind of spacer sleeve 
to make them work. So I picked up some scrap condiut. I ran the cable 
up front and then saw exactly how much was needed. I cut the spacer 
sleeve and banged on it to make sure it would fit just right. Worked 
like a charm! Did the other side to.

I took the truck for a drive around the neighborhood. The speedo 
works great. The emergency brake seemed to be working...except the 
handle wasn't functioning correct. The button wasn't working and so 
you pull on it and it wouldn't stay in place.

When I got back I got to looking at it and figured it was rusted up 
real good...bent a little too. I looked at my Bentley and tried to 
follow the directions for removing the handle. Unfortunatly the pin 
holding it in place wouldn't budge...and it was hard to get at. I saw 
there was a little room on each side of the handle between the mount 
and the handle that I could get at the pin. I figured I'd cut it out 
and just replace the pin with a bolt or something.

Out comes the reciprocating saw. Worked just like it was supposed to. 
Didn't mess up the handle or mounts either. Only thing is the middle 
part of the pin still in the handle wouldn't budge. I tried 
everything from banging it, to heat, liquid wrench...and finally 
tried drilling it. I didn't get to far doing that when I realized 
that I had a BIG job ahead of me. I decided to use one I had in my 
parts stash instead.

Now, the problem with this one was the same, the pin was rusted in 
place. Only difference is the whole pin was there. I had tore apart 
the mount on the donor bus I had got it from. I got at this one with 
the heating torch and bucket of water. I banged on it after each 
time. After a long time of patiently doing this, it moved and I 
banged the hell out of it and got it out. Cool!

Then I realized what I had done. I had bent up this handle real bad. 
The heat had softened the metal and when I banged on it it got 
tweaked and all warped up. I did my best to &quot;jesse james&quot; it back 
into shape but wasn't having luck. After 1/2 hour of this I finally 
decided to make some relief cuts into it and weld it back. So that's 
what I did. I cut through it almost all the way in 2 places and got 
it more lined up. I worked on it for about 15 minutes then welded it 
back up. I put the button mechanism back in to test it.

It worked! Amazing. So I cleaned it up and painted it. I sanded the 
rust off of and lightly greased the moving parts. I installed the 
f#cking thing and hooked up the cables. Finally...a working emergency 
brake!

I can't explain how much of a pain in the ass this was. I hope to 
never take one of these out of a bus again. It was a learning 
experience and that's about the best I can say about it.

I finished off the day today by removing the cracked windshields. The 
rubber looks new and looks like the guy cracked the glass trying to 
install it. So I've got some rubber to use. Also have some extra 
windshields out in the parts house.

On to another day....
