   If I recall right the WEBER copy was a copy of a carb from Japan that I
 have only ever seen 1 of.

well, I took the carb off the 67 camper than has 94 tags on it yesterday, and 
put a regular old (german used) solex 30 pict 2 on it   hm- anyone have the 
specs for jetting that carb on a 1600 in a 67bus?  Jets do make a difference- 
I need a chart - poster maybe to hang in the garage- fed gas to the pump from 
a gallon can, swapped batteries,  engine purrs!  in spite of the holes in the 
muffler.  It needs a drag link and rear brakes  (I did the fronts Sunday) 
before I'll try to drive it, and a few other things.  In fact, I have a full 
page of things to fix and/or check.  anyway.  the old Ate brake hoses were 
bad (surprise).  The front left drum was hot to touch after I got it home- 
about 10 miles.   I had used  brakes to stop it to hook up the tow bar- and 
it cleaned the drum off real nice- the left one was surface rusty.   And when 
I pulled the brake line clip out, it was UNDER the undercoating.  nice shiny 
pearl white paint under there.  Original brake hose?  

I took the W cab and undid the lid- so gummi inside.  this old gas smells 
icky. It is soaking- I'll be curious to see If I can get it to work,     It 
does have the W logo on it, and says made in Brasil on it, so sounds like it 
is one of those knock offs I guess.

other interesting thing is the air horn.  has an air pump and two horns.  
they say made in Italy, and have the Bosch logo on them.  I wonder if that 
works.
