Subject: Re: [VB] bus advice

You might not even need  new wires! It could be a bad switch or even fuses/bad connections which would be much cheaper to replace. I would assume LA has plenty of VW shops that could help you.
 
Vintagebus_dot_com has color wiring diagrams that might help you out as well.
