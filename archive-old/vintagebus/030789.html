Subject: What this &quot;List&quot; is all about--

Lately there have been some remarks about the quality content of this list--I just want to
say i just completed a great transaction with a member of the list i have never met. Pete
was selling something i was interested in--Turns out i had something he wanted--within a
few e-mails the deal was done. I few days later i received my package via UPS--It was
VWonderfull--Pete seems as thrilled as i am over how well his deal fits my Bessie!--This
is what the &quot;List&quot; is all about--Thanks Pete!!., uj
