Subject: 1960 15 window progress

    Well, I got all the brakes done on the front, they looked new but very
crusty, replaced 1 inner wheel bearing I destroyed getting off, they also
looked new. The front backing plates were covered with grease due to the
fact that the PO never reinstalled the grease seals. It looked like they did
the front brakes but couldn't get the inner bearings off so reinstalled the
drums without pressing in the grease seal, they were the original metal/felt
ones.
    The center pin is worn out, but don't have time to replace it before
Jerome, but I did replace the tie rods and the drag link is still good.  New
master, hoses and brake pedal return spring. A word of caution Wolfsberg
West brake pedal return springs are made off a little and need some fixing
to fit.
    I started to buff out the paint, amazing how old VW paint holds up,
being careful as to not erase the logos.
    Today I will turn the bus around and do the rear brakes, service the
trans and try to fire up the existing engine that is in it. If all goes well
I should be driving it by this weekend.
