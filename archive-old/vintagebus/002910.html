&gt; &gt; George,
&gt; &gt; You're forgetting the best cookies in the world and great bread.
&gt; &gt; I used to do a 100 mile bike ride every year that started and ended in
&gt; &gt; Solvang, couldn't get enough of those cookies after the ride &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yep, the cookies and bread are pretty good, have to give 'em that!
&gt;
&gt; Another good bakery stop is in Bishop, CA.  Schat's (yep, the name is
&gt; Dutch) bakery is an institution there and does a booming tourist
&gt; business.  Their Chili-Cheese bread is to die for.

We used to stop someplace in bishop for Sheephearders bread years and years
ago, back in the late 50's I think( am I admitting to being over the hill?)
&lt;G&gt;


&gt; &gt; Also, used to live in Morro Bay and always made up reasons to get down
&gt; &gt; there just to buy bread and cookies.
&gt;
&gt; Morro Bay!  We're heading up thataway soon to visit our inlaws in
&gt; Atascadero.  Nice country, lotsa buses.


Atascadero is a great little town.  Have you ever been up to Paso for the
Hot Rod meet?  Gathering at the A&amp;W, looks just like over the hill in Fresno
(American Graffiti)

Morro Bay is where ( if I'm not misteaken) Eric Meyers (Simple Shoes) has
had a bit of work done for some of the cars in his collection.  I only had
the Baja when I lived there but did see a lot of busses.

Jon
