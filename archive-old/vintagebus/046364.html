Subject: NOS front floor, nos metal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

We just welded a NOS floor in a 62 23 window about a week ago. Very nice fit.
Sorry it was the last of our floor sheet metal stock.
The reason VW does not have the die/stamp for the floor or any other early vw 
sheet metal is that the factory tears down the machine and  reuses it for new 
volkswagen products, ie Jetta's, Golf's etc etc. If I remember correctly the 
only die/stamp remaining from the good old days is a bug hood. A fact I 
learned during a tour of the Wolfsburg factory.
