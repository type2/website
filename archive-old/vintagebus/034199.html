&gt; Staying with the vintage parts is always better than some radio shack
&gt; special!!!
&gt;
&gt; That is after all why we like the &quot;vintage&quot; automobiles.  If it is new or
&gt; not original....  Go buy a new beetle or some other anonymous vehicle!!!

Oh yeah.  Modern technology like that new  radio thing...who needs it?
Besides  a working radio might drowned out the sound of that vintage squeal
coming from the original wheel bearing.  Those OG bearings look so cool when
they are original and unmolested.  Go vintage.  Keep it original and broken
;-)
