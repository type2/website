   Hi Volks (sigh),
 I am sad to say that my '61 Westy Hatchtop will not be ready for the trip to 
the Jerome, AZ. campout:&gt;(  I have flat run out of time.  Since the passenger 
side was damaged in a thunderstorm.  I have not been able to fix it correctly
and move on with the restoration, oh sadness is me!  After one full year of 
continuing work, I will slow down and do it right!
 Now for the humiliating part, I will have to talk to Ronnie ( Old Volks himself),
about driving a single cab to Jerome.  Woe is me, oh the groveling, begging,
tears!!!!! (Not Ronnie, ME!).  My wife and I are definitely going, so we'll see
ya there!  I can't type anymore, OH THE PAIN!!!
   Lou (sigh) in Havasu
P.S. BBBV for sure!!!!!!!!!
