&gt; Right.  And to get it flowing again, you either pull the knob out all
&gt; the way, so you're on reserve, or crawl under the bus and push it
&gt; back
&gt; to be drawing from the main.
&gt; 
&gt; Or is that not how it's supposed to work?

I don't think so :)

All the examples I have seen (and that's not too many) have cables that
work both ways!
