Isn't this the Way it always is Brian?

&lt;BIG SNIP&gt;
I kept a sharp eye out for my
turn south onto 54.  Only it turns out 54 is marked east and west, even
though it *distinctly* travels north &amp; south on the map.  GGGRRRRRR...  I
miss my turn...   I turn around for a second pass...  and going from this
way, the exit is marked AFTER the turn-off, and you can't see it until
you're past it.  I miss it a third time.  Turn around again, this time
turning onto the West-bound ramp.... There is a turn you're supposed to make
on the ramp, but it's not well marked... and I miss it for a FOURTH time...
turn around again, and from this direction you CAN'T GET ON going west!!!
Well I'm pretty damned steamed by then,
