Subject: Re: [VB] Sundial upholstery





&gt; Does anyone know if Sundial Campers came with ALL of the upholstery
&gt; matching, as opposed to the front seats remaining like they came from the
&gt; factory

Ours did, in fact all the material including the front privacy curtain is
the same. Thought it might be a recover, but the campbed and seat are
obviously factory.
