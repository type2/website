Hi Terry,

Welcome out from behind the lurker's curtain.
I occasionally get to Omaha to see clients, and although I don't typically
drive my '66 camper, I'd like to get together sometime and take a look at
your Westy.
Let me know if that sounds like fun.

&gt; I have always stopped a little short of a complete fill 'cause the heat
&gt; from the motor seems to cause enough expansion in the fuel to make it
&gt; leak out the filler spout. The 20-30 mile rule sound like a good one.
