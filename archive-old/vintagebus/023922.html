Subject: Type IV Upright Conversion #1, Report #1

Well OK, as promised to some of you, here is Report #1 of what should be
a somewhat continuing series of reports detailing the process of
converting a Type IV motor to go into where a Type I motor used to be. 

Conversion #1 will be my neighbor and going into his '73 Thing.
Conversion #2 will be me and going into my '60 double cab.

He beat me to the punch and was at the junk yard the other day and came
home with a complete '79 bus engine.  Reading Joe Cali's book about the
conversion, there was a statement that the completed/converted engine
just weighed 25 lbs more than a Type I engine.

As we took off a complete type I engine off of the engine stand and
replaced it with the complete type IV engine, neither of us could
imagine how that would be so.  The comment &quot;that engine is a PIG&quot; seemed
to be the refrain of the afternoon.

Layer by layer, all of the outerwear started to come off, Fuel
Injection, wires, cooling metal (NOTE: this is not cooling tin (read
lightweight), while it is aluminum, it adds up in weight).  All the
discarded parts started stacking up in a pile.  The cooling fan was
removed from the crank and the last big piece of cooling metal was able
to be removed.

We stood back and now we had a pile on the floor that looked like it was
bigger than the engine and probably weighs as much as the engine. 
Looking over at the engine stand was now something that looks quite
familiar, a Type I motor on steroids.  Some rough measurements yielded
some interesting numbers.  The engine is about one inch longer (crank
end to crank end) and about two inches narrower (valve cover to valve
cover).

That was enough for one evening,

Tommorow - the degreaser &amp; cleaning followed by breaking the engine down
and full inspection of all parts to determine if its a workable core.

Until Later
