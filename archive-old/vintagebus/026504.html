Subject: [VB] PLF, Dawn Smythe
Message-ID: &lt;3856AC14.55FB_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

I have known Dawn Smythe since I got a call from her a couple years ago,
stranded on the freeway near my house (20 miles or so) with a seized
engine. I went out and towed her in to town, found her a used engine for
the trip home, and she and I slammed it in her bus in the gravel
driveway outside my house. 

She was an excellent guest, and when she found out that I would be
restoring a 67 westy soon (actually it is  still on a back burner) she
gave me one of her  very nice pop-top canvas' in thanks for the help.

 I later purchased another canvas for a 71 bus, and then after I let a
friend use the one I had been given for a more immediate restoration, I
bought another split small-pop canvas from Dawn.

 I know of at least two other people in my our Oregon club who have
purchased pops and canvas tents from Dawn, and they have always been
thrilled with the product. But the orders were never delivered quickly.
Dawn was always very honest about her backlog, and gave estimates from
between one and three months for certain products. I have never heard of
her failing to deliver.

Dawn recently relocated her entire business and family to Arizona. ( Or
was it New Mexico?) I received several emails telling about the move,
with new snail addresses and email addresses. I didnt even have any live
orders with her, but she paid me this consideration anyways, as a
customer who may need to get in touch. 

My point is that I find it hard to believe that Dawn has dissappeared
and wont be heard from again. Much more likely, she is getting her act
together after moving, and will shortly be getting rolling again.

As for Todd Hill, I thought he had gotten square with everyone before he
disappeared???? Does he still owe anyone a tranny or money? If not,
maybe we should all stop dissing him on the list. And if so, maybe those
owed should be the only folks with any right to be slamming him???
