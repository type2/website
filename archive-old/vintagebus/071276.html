Subject: Re: [VB] Back up lights

Did the nosecone have a place for the switch on all '67 nose cones?  Or just
on the nose cones that were in a bus with reverse lights.  My '67 is an
early '67 without reverse lights, so I'm asking if it would have the switch
or not.  Where on the nose cone is it located?  Thanks.

&gt; there is a switch.  either you have one in the nose cone (67 nose cone)
which
&gt; mean if you don't you have to remov ethe tranny to swap nose cones, major
&gt; PITA.  But if you do pull the tranny you might keep in mind the reverse
light
&gt; switch nose cone.   That activates a switch when the bus is in reverse.
you run
&gt; a wire from the coil 15 to an in line fuse to the reverse light switch on
the
&gt; tranny, then back and to the reverse lights.   I did this on my 61,
thought I
&gt; put a pic on the samba, not sure.  attached a 67 bug style reverse light
to
&gt; the bumper.
