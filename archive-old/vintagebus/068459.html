Subject: Re: [VB] California &quot;Pink&quot; slips

Funny thing I've noticed about CA titles and regs. when it comes to trucks.....most 1/2 or 3/4 ton trucks are registered as &quot;commercial&quot; vehicles on the title.  My 93 Ford p/u had the same &quot;commercial&quot; on the title.  Also had a 62 Singlecab in Vegas with a &quot;commercial&quot; CA pink slip.

Another thing I've noticed is that alot of buses with og black or og yellow plates have &quot;commercial&quot; truck plate number sequences.  My 63 EZ Camper has normal &quot;passenger&quot; car black plates with the AAA 123 sequence.

Most panels and trucks have the truck plates with an A12345 or 12345A sequence.

I can understand Kombis and Deluxes being considered a pass. vehicle, but the strange thing is my camper was originally a Panel.  Maybe the dealer made the distinction when sending in the registration.  Mike Alcorn's Sundial also has the pass. car black plate sequence.

Damn...I just realized how bored I am to be writing this crap =)

&gt; Yeah, I got mine for the DC back in December and noticed that.  Mine
&gt; has a 'commercial' title for some reason, so I thought 
&gt; that's why the
&gt; color difference.
