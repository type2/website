&lt;&lt; I am told that the place for the pop out latch to screw into on the * 
body*  
 is in a slightly different place in barndoors with the horizontal bitframes 
 than in double cabs with the horizontal bit frames, and the latches do fit 
 funky in the wrong vehicle &gt;&gt;

From memory...Where the latches screw to the body both early and late have a 
three hole screw pattern, kind of a triangle on it's side.  The two screw 
holes at the base of the triangle are the same both early and late but the 
earlier latches the point of the triangle is closer in.
