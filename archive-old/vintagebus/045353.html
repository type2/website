Bob,

I thought it was the fellow before Ken who came up with the 'Sermon' name.
(see below.)

 &lt;&lt;  To refer to your own writings as
  &quot;Sermons&quot; is a little over the top.  To recommend a stranger to buy a
  Toyota is a little presumptuous.  To refer to the people who ask you for
  help as &quot;little kiddies&quot;  is just plain f*cked up.  The boy is silly.... &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;

Jack (and the List)

The 'sermon' appelation was coined by Mr. Richard Kurtz, the fellow who
created the archive.  (You can imagine my reaction :-)  But Richard put a lot
of effort into collecting the articles and creating a web-site, all at his own
expense.  One doesn't look a gift-horse in the mouth.  To poke a little fun
back at him, I started adding 'sermonettes' to my articles :-)

As for recommending Toyotas to strangers, Toyota does it all the time :-)

Actually, the Toyota is a very well-made vehicle that requires only modest
amounts of maintenance compared to an early air-cooled Volkswagen.  When
someone indicates they are unwilling or incapable of maintaining an antique
Volkswagen I often recommend they buy a Toyota.  I own one myself.  It
belonged to my late brother.  I keep it as both pet and rememberance.  It's a
nice little truck, which is why I recommend it.

As for &quot;little kiddies&quot;, perhaps that should have been Big Kiddies.  When
you're sixty years old, most people are 'kiddies' .  Especially the foolish
ones who don't check their facts.
