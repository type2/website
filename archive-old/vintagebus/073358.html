&gt; &gt;A user on my site recently found these &quot;tools&quot; when removing his bed from
&gt; &gt;his truck, hidden down
&gt; &gt;underneath for years. Can anyone guess what they are, what they were for,
&gt; &gt;or if they are even
&gt; &gt;related to VW?
&gt;
&gt; Cow tools.

How many people will catch that GL reference?  :)

From the looks of the pictures, they look like something made to hold the
edge of something (gates, perhaps?) a set distance away from something
else that has a ridge running along that the two &quot;feet&quot; can straddle.  The
threaded T-handle whatsits look like they thread into the two hook
parts, perhaps as a height adjuster?

They don't really look &quot;finished&quot; enough to be factory tooling, but who
know?
