The Tri-State VW Club will be trying to improve on what Troy Hezenrauter
has made so
wonderful...
First thing we're trying to do is get more people to come out and camp
Friday evening. We should have the concession trailer going and
sandwiches and fries will be available. We're also going to have a
pancake and sausage breakfast at 8am Saturday for a very reasonable cost.
By coming out Friday you also get to pick the choice campsites (i.e. the
flat ones).
Saturday the show should be as nice as ever, weather man says It's going
to be just right for cruising the swap lane or checking out the fresh
restorations in the car show area. We'll also be having some kids games
including a &quot;Paint the Honda&quot;, Tri-State VW Club logo coloring contest,
and a radiator fill contest. At 4 o'clock a Homemade Spaghetti dinner
will be available to all for $5 per person. In the evening the
festivities will continue with a pampered chefs party for the ladies at
6:30, and the VW parts auction for the guys. Troy also has a competition
of some sort planned. Later on in the evening a bonfire will be
constructed for everyone.
Sunday is usually a laid back, pack 'em up and head home day. This year
we will be blowing up a Honda at Noon. As usual a bacon and eggs
breakfast will be available at 8am. We will also be handing out the
participants choice awards #1, #2, #3, plus a promoter's choice, club
choice, and 5 novelty awards including - Dirtiest oil, Most oil leaks,
Best work in Progress, Hard Luck, and Best Camper at 2pm.

Hope to see everyone there, I think I'll have a name tag on - just
introduce yourself....

P.S. John gave some good directions, I have a map I can send to anyone
you may need it. Just send me a message to brotherhoodvw_at_juno_dot_com
