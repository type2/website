very reliable.

No S**t.  This happened to me.  I stripped 2 of these damn holes and my
local flaps used up all his inserts trying to fix them.  I still have
one hole stripped and another one that the bolt will only go in halfway.

    Ihad to use a small jack to hold the spring plate up just a little
bit so it would be even with the RB.  A royal pain.  What is &quot;time-sert&quot;
and how do you do it?  Also, what size insert do you use when repairing
these stripped holes?
Thanks,
Jon- &quot;3 bolts on either side&quot; 65 standard
