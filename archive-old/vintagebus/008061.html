&gt; Try POR-15 http://www.por15_dot_com. They have an Auto Fuel Tank Repair Kit
listed on their Restoration Kits page for $49.95. I ordered one of the
Motorcycle Tank Kits from their site and it arrived in 2-days. I haven't
used it yet so I can't comment on the product first hand. I do know many
others who swear by their products though.
&gt;
I actually have one of these 10 gallon kits I've been taking to local shows
trying to sell because it was from a project I no longer own.

I didn't want to keep it around because I figured the chemicals had a
certain shelf life.

If anyone wants it, the kit is unopened, make an offer.

Everett
