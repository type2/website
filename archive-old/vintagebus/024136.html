Subject: last chance - rough 66 deluxe (and bays) going to crusher in
	Providence RI

List,  I have been off line since before the holidays so please disregard if 
this has already been posted.  (I did do a quick archive scan).  A guy named 
Eric Goepfert in Providence RI has a rough 66 deluxe he is going to cut up on 
Monday.  I just heard about it.  

Anyway there are some pictures at:
http://spacehead.homestead_dot_com/theyard.html

his home page is at:
http://spacehead.homestead_dot_com

there is a classified ad at:
http://www.classifieds2000_dot_com/cgi-cls/ad.exe?P1+C17+A0+R68185+Q351425321+View
AdDetails

I am not going to be able to do anything with this.  

Please contact Eric at 401-274-8402 or spacehead_at_hotmail_dot_com (Eric Goepfert) 
NOT ME :)

Tom Good in Vermont

PS. Here is the message I got from Eric:

Well let me send you over to http://spacehead.homestead_dot_com
Press the vw sale button (at the top of the page) for photos.
I will be  cutting it up as that I have not heard from anyone and I could 
use some of the clips. I am packing up monday and must have the yard cleared 
(or arangements to the like) by the time i leave (I am dissolving this 
garage space)If you are interested and can remove this bus please email me 
or call 401-274-8402 as soon as possible
I check email in the morning and eve
I check phone messages at noon or so and in the evening at 6ish.
I will be sending it(and the 69,and the 79 high top) to the shredder as that 
I have no other choice(sad but true)
All the doomed busses have great beams(79 has a booster)and transmissions.
I am in Providence RI
Please contact me if you can devise a plan.
and as for spreading the word please do, I would like for this stuff to get 
recycled back into the vw community rather than into tin cans.
