&gt; this is actually not so. in fact, the curing process seems to have
&gt; literally NO END since concrete keeps changing. It is very mysterious
&gt; stuff. all of the chemical reactions which go into its formation are not known.

As I understand it, the curing process depends upon water.  The curing
process continues within the slab where water remains, but as I understand
it the idea is to keep the surface wet so that the entire thickness of the
slab will complete most of its cure rapidly (as in a couple of weeks).  I
had always understood that drying out stopped the process, but I'm just
going on what others have said.  To be safe, I keep things wet for a lot
longer than a typical concrete contractor would.

&gt; &gt; ALSO, it will eventually crack, despite rebar, thickness and careful
&gt; formulation and curing. and crack control joints. In my other life i
&gt; was an architect, am married to an architect who specialized in
&gt; concrete structures. cracking is the nature of concrete, not a bad
&gt; thing, it is just what it eventually does no matter what.

Yeah, the guy who did my slab was amused when I told him to add more
joints and the  actually measured their depth.  No cracks, though!
