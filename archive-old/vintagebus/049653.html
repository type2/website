&gt;    *Sears Craftsman Two-Stage Oil free compressor (model# 919.167770) + 25'
&gt;hose $513.00

Take this back right now and get an oil-lubed compressor... over on the
OleCh*vyTrucks List, there has been copious discussion on what a P*S these
things ares. Especially the Sears ones.
On the other hand, my Sears 5hp 50 gallon 5hp oiler compressor has been
going for years, and I got it cheap as a rebuild. In fact, a broken hose
recently caused it to run non-stop for four hours while I was at work -
cooled it down, changed the oil and it seems to have suffered no damage.
Guy down the street had one in a shed for 10 years and never even topped
off the oil. Still going when he closed shop.

It doesn't work as well as a REAL compressor, but I didn't spend $900+, either.

YMMV.
