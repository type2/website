well that just it i didnt bitch and moan i just stated the facts and asked
for an answer and prices on other stuff, i mean $58 is not the deal, having
a good dependable supplier is and having a web site means that you should be
capable of doing business via email, or at least have sense enough to
respond to the ones that are ordering or have ordered, thats a matter of
filtering email, etc

&gt; I think the main problem here (besides crappy mirrors) is relying on email
&gt; for this type of complaint.  Sure I realize it's easier to bitch and moan
&gt; about something via email rather than over the phone (just like it's
easier
&gt; to bitch over the phone than it is in person) but until you get someone on
&gt; the phone and let them know you arent going to put up with crap like the
&gt; mirrors they sent you, not much is going to happen.
&gt;
&gt; Be more assertive, pick up the phone, talk to the man in charge!
&gt;
&gt; just my $0.02
