Subject: RE: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Out of the hundreds of engines I have done over the last 28 years I have had
very few oil leaks at the oil pump, either at the body or the cover. The
reason why is that I blue print each and every pump I install. Everything is
flat where it should be and fits snug into the block. I actually install the
pump BEFORE the block halves are torqued with a liberal amount of P-3H. This
insures tight seal, always. The pump covers get worked over on the flat stone
until perfectly level. Any cover with excessive pump gear grinding gets
tossed. I also massaged the inlet and outlet channels in the pump for smoother
flow.

If you buy a new voltage regulator for your generator you must polarize it,
but not the generator.

I have heard that they all leak. That may become acceptable if after a
reasonable attempt it still drips. Meanwhile it is my mantra: fix the oil
leaks, fix the oil leaks, ....

&gt; did you polarise  the generator?
There are only two wires to the generator. I had them backwards at first. Then
I checked my other engine and reallized I had it wrong. So I switched it. The
light is still brightly lit. Maybe after having it hooked up wrong it would
require polarizing?

&gt; brushes in good shape?

Brushes looks like they are pretty long. They don't look worn out and they are
in place. This generator did work less than two months ago fine.
