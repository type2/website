 This is the stuff


	It looks to be the same product I am using. I have found that Home
Depot will carry a flat or two and then it takes them a while to get it back
in. ABC might be the company they stock but if not it is the same stuff. I
have a roll that has clear plastic on one side and has a white plastic you
peal on the other.

I did something similar to my car recently (not a VW) and it worked really
well.  I couldn't find any of it at Home Depot or Lowes but did find it at a
company called ABC Supply Company.  They offer it in 33.5 foot lengths and
whatever width you want.  I used the 12&quot; wide stuff and it was $33 for the
roll (so, about $1 a sq. ft.).  Here is a link to their 36&quot; wide stuff.

and the 12&quot; wide stuff.

You can order it online or go to your local store (which is what I did)

Hope it helps.
