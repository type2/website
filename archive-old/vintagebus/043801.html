Subject: Re: [VB] Choke n me out!

&gt;When the vehicle is cold and the choke power wire attached it will not
&gt;start.  Pull the choke power wire off and it will fire up and run
&gt;instantly.  Reattach the choke power wire and it runs fine like normal.

As others have said, try adjusting the choke first.  The only thing I
have to add to that is that normally, having power to the choke should
make it come *open*, eventually.  In other words, having the wire
hooked up should be working towards helping you, not hurting you.
I wonder if maybe your choke has a short or otherwise a lower-than-normal
resistance which is helping to drag down the voltage on circuit 15
(hot with key on).

The only problem with this is that I can't find a good reference value
for the resistance of (any) automatic choke.  After a bit of Googling I
did find a value of 18 ohms for a late 80s Honda (12 volt).  This says
that it is about an 8 watt heater, so to get the same heat out of a 6
volt element, it'd have to measure about 4.5 ohms.

You might pull the wire off the choke and measure the resistance 
between the choke terminal and the body of the carburetor.  Anything
over a couple of ohms is probably fine; anything much less than that
(like zero) probably indicates a problem.

Another way to tell this would be to pull the wire off the choke,
turn the key on, and measure the voltage between the wire and ground.
Then hook the wire back up (key still on) and measure the voltage
between the choke terminal and ground; if it's dropped a lot then
this may be the problem.

Again, adjusting your choke is more likely to fix your problem and
can't hurt in any case.  Just thought I'd throw this out.
