&gt; Hello everyone,

Actually, if you apply (hand-sprayer bottle) some POR Metal Ready or
equivalent phosphoric acid dilution to the bare steel, it will keep and
not rust pretty much forever. Rinse off before continuing body prep work
when ready.

When my deluxe was in the resto shop, there was an old vintage porsche
totally bare metal, sitting there for years - it had been sprayed with the
above stuff to hold it while the owner agreed on a color. Funny, but in
typical body/resto shop fashion, that car was still there when my deluxe
was finished, 19 months later.
