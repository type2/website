&lt;&lt; I was about to do the valves for the first time on my '63 bus (40hp) and
 I see in the official VW workshop manual that it calls for .008 on the
 intake valves and .012 on the exhaust valves.  That differs greatly from
 Muir who basically says .006 all around.  Who's right? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
It depends on which engine you have in there, or if you still have the 
original engine, what has been done to it.  The original early 40HP had long 
studs to hold the rocker arms on, and required the .008&quot;, and .012&quot; valve 
lash.  VW then manufactured a later 40HP with shorter stud there due to the 
problem of the earlier longer studs pulling out thier threads in the heated 
aluminium.  This shorter stud used the .006&quot; measurement on up the the last 
of the upright engines.  VW put out a short rocker stud kit to repair those 
early long studs soon after the short studs became standard.  Lastly your 
original engine could also have later 40HP heads on it!  Eric&amp;Barb
