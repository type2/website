Chech the archives, there was a long discussion/thread about this a while
ago(may 6-9months ago.

I think Bob Hoover wrote in reccommending Bon Ami(which I think is just like
ajax, but slightly different). This was just for cleaning, then cerium oxide(I
think) and a polisher for getting rid of the minor scratches.I think Eastwood
probably sells something like this, but he reccomended getting it fdrom an
optician's store because ist was a lot cheaper.

Not sure if I am remembering this exactly, so check the archives, if you can't
find it there, let me know and I can look-I believe I have a print out of that
somewhere...as I intended to do it to my windshields, buit haven't gotten
around to it yet.
