&lt;&lt; I just got my 1963 single cab on the road and need some heater cable help.
 One side is supposed to be longer than the other.  Does anyone know by how
 much?  There are none in it presently.  Or does anyone have the pre-bent NOS
 type they could sell to me or at least measure? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gary,
It seems to change if you have a bench seat or a walk thru.  Since your bus is
a single cab truck it should be a bench seat.  Really the best way is to
install the cable with the heater knob barely threaded on it's mount.  Crawl
under the rear and pull on the ends of the heater cable to take out slack and
measure the differances of length from the tubes to the ends of the cables
between them.  If one side is longer than the other then clamp a vise grip on
the shorter end to keep it from being pulled back into the tube.  Go up front
inside the bus and remove the heater knob and pull lightly on the cable evenly
at first and when the vise grip stops the one end of the cable then pull a
little more on the other cable end and make your adjustment.  Remember to only
adjust for only half of the measured distance that you got off the cable ends.
In other words if there was a 1&quot; measured differance, then only move .5&quot; to
the shorter side.  Good Luck, Eric &amp; Barb
