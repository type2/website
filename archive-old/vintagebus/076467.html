Subject: Re: [VB] Our classic VW's, not

In Georgia, no classic cars, only antique ones. Must be 25+ years old (and
even lowly VW's qualify). Picture on the tag is a Model T. Now that's
antique!

   I was just informed through motor vehicles that VW's ARE NOT considered
classic cars. Motor vehicles bases there information on what is supplied to
them by CCCA (classic car club of america) I went down their list of
CLASSIC's and nowhere was VW to be found!!!!!!, but our motor vehicles does
consider them HISTORIC.
   It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic plate
requirements to see what other states think and/or use as their guideline
for classic car plates
