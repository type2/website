Subject: SC in NC Junkyard

FYI,

During a trip Wednesday to recover a '76 Westy, Roy and I found a single
cab in a salvage yard.  It appears to have been there since the late
70's (inspection sticker is dated 1977) and is pretty rough, but I've
seen people fix up alot worse.  The side gates are straight, but the
tail gate has been replaced with a decent home made one.  The driver's
vent window is the only glass missing, but both windshields are cracked.
Rear window is in good shape.  I don't know my early bus model features,
but it has the bullet turn signals and small round single taillights
(pre 1962?).

The bed was full of leaves and other debris. I would expect that it is
rusted out, except that the treasure chest is in reasonable shape (at
least compared to my '69 that has a hole in the bed behind the driver's
seat and, as a result, no treasure chest floor left at all).

I observed no significant dents or body damage, beyond the rusted
rockers and front valance area.  The cab floor was covered with debris,
but the cab appears to have remained reasonably weathertight.  The bench
seat is still there, and the cab bulkhead doesn't have the huge dents
I've seen in all too many trucks (including mine :-( ).

I'm not the most qualified inspector, but it looked to me as if it were
at worth least acquiring as a parts vehicle, if not a resto project.

We weren't able to talk to the yard owner, his wife allowed us to go in
and look at it, but she didn't have any information on it.  This is one
of those junkyards in the mountains that seams to be more landfill that
salvage yard.  I didn't spot any other VWs, but it's hard to tell with
all the trees, ridge lines, and hollows.  I don't know if they part out,
sell whole vehicles, or both.

I put some pics of it up at:
