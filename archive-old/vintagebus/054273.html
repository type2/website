does anybody know what m-code 798 is?  i know i posted this about a year =
and a half ago, but nobody knew then.  im checking again to see if =
anyone figured it out.  ive checked the archives and type2 library =
again.  i also did a search on thoms site and only 4 buses came up with =
that code (one of them being my 65), and the other 3 were all 65's as =
well.  thanks!
