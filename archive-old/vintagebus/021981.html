&lt;&lt; In an attempt to replace my decklid hinges I descoved that the screws from
the
 hinge to body are stripped out. :( Anyone had to deal with this and know of a
 damage free way to get them out?

Hi Norman,
Buy a few cobalt 1/8&quot; drill bits and if you do not have a set of numbered
drills then buy a set.  Drill first with the 1/8&quot; in this case or a drill bit
of half the dia. of the fastener shaft to be removed in smaller cases.  Make
sure you drill as straight as possible and if nessary use a square you can
make out of carboard to check the drill bit angle in two places 90 degrees
apart.  Then drill slightly bigger and bigger drill bits until the threads
start to show.  Use a tap of the right size and threading for your use to
remove the last of the material.  Instead of the normal one turn in half turn
back of tapping you will probably be better off doing it in a half turn in
quarter turn out and remove the tap often to make sure to keep it clear of
debris that can lock up the tap and cause it to break.  In case of holes that
are not upside down that will not allow them to unload these debris via
gravity, you can use a nail with a strong magnet attached to the nail head to
attract the steel shavings out of the hole you are working on. 
   There are others who will advise using easy-outs which are hardened steel
and if you break these off without taking precations you will spend hours of
time grinding out the easy-out since they are not drillable.  The only times
that it is advisable to use a easy out is when the fastener has just been
installed a little while ago and greased well when this was done.  Even then
it is more important that you drill all the way through the fastener and can
get to the other end of that hole to insert a punch and hammer back out the
broken easy-out.          Eric &amp; Barb
