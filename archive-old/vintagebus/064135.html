Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Q

&gt; Anyway, I was thinking
&gt; that if it worked I could use it anyway for other
&gt; projects ('70 Westfalia). So here's the question(s):
&gt; can I test it myself to see if it works? And if so how
&gt; do you do that and what do you need? It is also one of
&gt; those Bosch ones that has the three prongs on it plus
&gt; the sending (B+ ?) terminal, it's off of a '74 Bug.

You should go back and get the harness with the plug on it and the voltage
regulator under the rear seat, left side.

It is not a Bosch unit, it is a Motorola. Look at the edge around the pulley
and you should a M in a circle. The M looks like bat wings. You need the
matching Motorola regulator.
