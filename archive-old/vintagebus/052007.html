Subject: Fuel Tank Swap Smells

Hey,

A while back I performed the fuel tank swap, retrofitting the 70's tank in
my 63' Panel.  The problem I am having is a very pungent smell of gas.  I
tightened the clamps on the filler neck, but the smell is still there.  I'll
pull the engine and tank, if need be, but I was wondering if the hose coming
out of the top of the tank, needs to be vented.   I plugged that hose when I
installed the tank because It didn't have a place to go.  Could pressure be
building in the tank,  causing vapor to leak inside the cargo area?
Also I should mention, the PO had cut a hole above the engine, like later
model busses.  I have it sealed fairly well for your garden variety engine
smells, but not well enough it seems!

Thanks in advance...

Kevin Albrecht
