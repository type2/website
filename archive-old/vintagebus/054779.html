(replying to the reply, missed the original...)

A loose setscrew at the rear coupling will do this...even easier if there
are two loose.  It still has enough grab to slide fore and rear, but not
enough for the side to side.  Possibly.

I've also seen the hole wallowed out, with a similar effect..no matter how
tight you tighten, it doesnt help....we welded the area back up and
drilled a nice new hole for the set screw..

But yeah, crawl under and watch each bit. wiggle and jiggle it by hand if
you cant get help immediately.  if it's loose, it's a problem.
