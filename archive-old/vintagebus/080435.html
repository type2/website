Subject: Re: [VB] RE: stereo install under dash -- PLUS theft control

That is the top of the line 8 track player.   I mounted one under the dash in 
my 61. 

  Anyone have Black Sabbath &quot;Paranoid&quot; on 8 track?

took an old Pioneer supertuner 8-track tape player and gutted the
insides. I then hinged the front face to fold up and down. I installed a
CD player on the inside and mounted it under the dash with the original
&quot;u&quot; braket. Now I just flip the face down on the 8-track and play my CDs
or listen to the radio.
When I am all done I flip it back up to look like a &quot;worthless to
steal&quot; 8-track tape player.
