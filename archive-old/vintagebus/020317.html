 Man I felt like a loser.

Loser? Not in my book! Everything happens for a
reason. You don't know it but perhaps you were
protected from a more dreadful fate than
herking-jerking and almost bumping of head on
windshield. It must have been the will of &quot;Jah!&quot; ;-)
According to the book of Aerocool 4:20 it is written,
&quot;Relax and look forward to the next time. Life goes
on. If your friends abandon you for not showing up to
the OCTO/Classic then they were never friends to begin
with.&quot; You still have the best bus. -just not at those
events. =)
Everyone- have a great week,
