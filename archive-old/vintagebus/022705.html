Subject: Got Myself a Sundial?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey folks...nice to be back on the list and with a new Bus!

Last month I bought what I believe to be a 63 Sundial.  In the meantime, a
lot of questions have come up as to whether or not it really is a Sundial.
The interior was redone by the 2nd owner (I'm 4th) in a cheap dark
wood...so if there was a badge, it's gone now.  It has louvered windows,
not awning-style, but what gets me in all the research I've done is that
the driver's side set of windows consist of louvers-solidpane-louvers.  The
only reference I've seen to those are on Rivieras, but the Riviera
information says they didn't start until 1965.  I've got a whole bunch of
pictures on my website (see sig, click on &quot;1963 Sundial&quot;) and I would
appreciate any ideas from all of you.  I even wandered the archives for an
hour and found no definitive answers.  My only hope may come this Friday
when I get prints back from a set of negatives I found behind the kick
panels last weekend!

Thanks in advance, 
-Taylor
