&lt;&lt; you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to the right, and
 vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber, or bumpsteer.
 Has anyone done this themselves? I know many of you don't agree with
 lowering a bus, but I think the lowered buses that I've been seeing in
 HotVW's look really good. &gt;&gt;
Thats how the previous owner of my 59 lowered it. poor thing, scraped the 
ground all the time. You have to grind out the back of the spindle so it wont 
bind up, Thats the only modification I noticed, but there may be more. Or, If 
you're in my area, you could trade me your nice stock front end for the 
lowered one. I've also got a type three tranny and custom springplates 
that'll make the ass end drag too. Yours for your reduction box tranny.
