I don't think any of the split-window buses came with an access hole
above the engine.   I feel I need to qualify that, or Clara will come
out with &quot;there was M-code 987 for the Sumerian market with had that&quot;

&gt; One of the PO's cut a really cool huge square hole above the engine, I
&gt; guess so they could get at the engine from above.  I have found the
&gt; panels to replace this hole, but on my '65 there is a 11&quot; or 12&quot; inch
&gt; round hole above the engine.  Should this hole also be in an early '59
&gt; or should the panel be solid.
