There is a modified SP intake manifold with fuel injector ports welded on
the ends. There is a air throttle body that mounts to the carb mount and it
has an anemometer, vac port, and electric choke. Have seen them but not on a
running engine. Anyone have pics of one in a car, I would like to see it.
