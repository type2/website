Ever here of a spitznagel?
A.K.A. nail gun.
A.K.A. slide hammer w/o drilling holes.
Thats probably the best way.

&lt;&lt; I was admiring the iron oxide formations on my '62 bus last weekend -- ah,

the wide open spaces of the rotten rockers!  Well, at some point, this

ex-church-bus had a luggage rack mounted onto the roof.  The kind where you

have to drill holes of course, to make my life interesting.  At the front of

the roof it looks like a branch whacked it.  It's not an extraordinarily

large dent and it doesn't extend to the drip rails, but it has made the

overhead vent in the cab separate a touch from the roofline.  It's mostly

all attached but the dent has pushed it down in places.  The PO had

ingeniously filled the gaps with spray foam.  Darn clever, those POs.


My idea to fix the rack holes is to grind at the ragged metal inside the bus

(it's like they simply drove nails through it!), weld it up when it's all

smooth, and grind again.  I'm sort of at a loss for the front

dent/vent-coming-off-sorta mess though.  If the vent can come off, I would

think the best repair would be to remove it or pry it down a bit, and fix

the dent that way.  If it can't, or is difficult to remove/replace, I'm not

sure how to best approach it.  Any suggestions on how to remove the overhead

vent or what to do in general?
