Her is my take on this.The quality of a lot of the aftermarket parts is so
poor,what would you rather have?Something that was built for the vehicle by
and/or specificaly for your vehicle or something that just fits and looks
cool?Why do Lenny Coop and Douglas get more money for their interiors than
JC Whitney?Would you rather put in 5 starters this year for $20 that were
&quot;rebuilt&quot; by a five year old in Thiland or spend $80 on a Bosch unit that
will probably last as long as you own the vehicle?I for one do a lot of
research on the parts I put on my vehicles as far as company,quality,history
and past experince.If I can find something that will work and not affect my
and others safety as well as not having to chase problems and/or redo at a
later date I will go with that product.I am having the bench for my
singlecab recovered locally because the person does a quality job with
materials that are very close in apperance and quality for about half of the
west coast rate,not because I am cheap but because I will use this as a
truck and would be freaked out and pi**ed if I scratched,tore or hurt it in
any way.I am thinking about putting in safari's and if so will refurbish an
original set.Just my point of view nothing against you.

Ya know, I am gonna incurr such a wrath for saying this, but *nothing* on a
bus should cost that much (save for engine, paint or body work).  I've been
writing an article on my beef with eBay...how it's artificially inflated
the prices on the used parts market, but I realise now that you don't
always need eBay to get outrageous prices.  Before anyone starts, I'm not
trying to pick on tds here.  I've seen these senseless price blowups
before.  I know this is going to start such a loooong thread (and I better
check email from school today) but if company X is selling safaris for,
say, $300, then what about original safaris makes them worth the extra
$100-300?  I'm not saying people don't have a right to try to get what they
can for parts, I just want to understand the logic behind it.
