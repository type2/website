Subject: Riviera Campers...now I'm a little more confused.
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey all,

Kirin: Gorgeous camper!  Worth every penny!

But I was checking out the pictures of it and it got me even more confused
about Riviera Campers (an easy thing to do).  I believe I have a '63
Riviera, built out of a panel, with jalousies all the way around except
that the driver's side has the long picture window.  Emailing with John
Howard (who had a '64 Riv. at the time) proved that both picture windows
were identical.  I'd have asked for interior details, but the 2nd owner
rebuilt the interior at one time...no idea if it was an accurate rebuild.

Anyway, I later found pictures of a nice '67 Riviera which also had the
picture window, but had sliding windows instead of the jalousies.  Okay, I
figured, '67 was far enough from '63...they probably made some stylistic
changes.

Enter Kirin's '65 (reportedly the first year Rivieras were built).  It
looks like he has crank-out windows...almost a more Sunidal-esque feature.
And no picture window!  Plus a different tent-mounting system: mine uses
Sundial style tent whereas Kirin's has that big sliding piece.  No, I'm not
trying to say he doesn't have a Riviera...I'm just trying to piece together
some history or facts that'll help me decide whether or not mine is a
Riviera or a home-job.

Thoughts?  Comments?  Should I just bring a bunch of pics to LA next weekend?
