This is just absolutely great Thom!  Man - whenever I find an old bus, it's
got so much rust in it.  Those buses look like piece of cakes as far as
bodywork is involved.  I can tolerate dents better than I can deal with
missing pieces of metal due to rust.  You're fortunate to find them in this
kind of shape.  Enjoy!
