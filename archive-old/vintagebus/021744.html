So the replacing of the front wheel bearings went pretty well, they were
all discoloured and a couple were pitted really badly, tho now I seem to
notice more sloppyness in the steering.  I haven't really looked to
closely at it, maybe I will today.  Maybe I should replace the fluid in
the steering box - I topped it up last fall with 80-90w and I read
somewhere only 90w should be used?

it should be okay-   use gear oil in it.

Anyway, I'm wondering about my rear bearings.  I was told they should be
repacked and I do notice a &quot;howl&quot; sound from back there.  But the &quot;howl&quot;
is about 30% of what it was before the front bearing replacement :).
The Mango has no interior or insulation and tires (205/65/15's - I
think) that need replacing soon and I'm very inexperienced with
diagnosis via sound.  So I should just go in as far as the first set of
bearings in the rear, right?  No need for me to go near the reduction
boxes, right? *gulp* Other than to check fluid levels, right?  Do I need
a puller of some sort to get the ball bearing out?

well, it ...could... be a tranny noise.   Have you changed your tranny oil in
the past year?  If not please go ahead and do so---  drive it around first to
warm everything up, then drain the center section,    put the plugs back in,,
 jack on eside up, pull the tire/rim, drain it,  fill it,  repeat other side
and lastly fill the center section.    All magnetic plugs should be cleaned
of metal fur.      take your time and let it drip.     After new oil,  go for
a drive and see how it sounds.
