I would go for the $695 exchange swapout.  The price sounds very reasonable
(I had my longblock rebuilt for $700 this summer).  Although you may be
compitent enough to do the rebuild, there are no gaurantees that you wont
make a mistake and wind up stripping the engine again (?? maybe even
spending the $695 anyway ??) because you forgot something.  Whoever rebuilt
the engine for sale at CRAM (more than likely)has done many engines before
this one.   There is no substitute for repetition.

Once the engine is back together, you dont want to go back into it again.

(my  $.02 worth)






&gt;I'm debating whether to rebuild an engine since I need the experience or
just do a long block swap - $695 exchange at CRAM in Omaha.
