Subject: RE: [VB] ARC vs. MIG - torsion bars

I probably got the wrong book but correct information. Probably the backyard
book from Wilson or whatever. Now I am going to have to go look it up again
to make sure I wasn't shooting off my mouth. The only reason something like
that stuck in my mind was because I have to replace the ones on my 67 SC and
I have been having a back and forth conversation with Clara to come over and
replace them at her place for my fresh 40hp. I'll look it up again. Maybe it
was BusBoys catalog? who knows!

&gt;According to the 63-67 Bentleys, the welded end torsion bars are the
&gt;replacement for the separate leaf bars. Separate leaf bars were to be
&gt;used until stocks ran out, but the welded end bars were preferred.

I can't find where the Bentley says that.  On V-6 4 it mentions that the
non-welded bars can only be used with the torsion arms with sealing
washers, 211 405 103 A andd 211 405 153 A, and says the welded bars will
remain available.  It does kind of imply that the welded bars are a
&quot;universal&quot; replacement.
