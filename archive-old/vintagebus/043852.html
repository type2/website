Hi eric and barb,

I would strongly disagree with the word definitely. I would say 4 bearings
per side were a necessity due to lowering the gearing.  Once you have 2
gears there, they have to be supported both ends to mesh properly unless
the shafts are fixed and stiff, which they are not in this case.

If you think about it, a stub axle is a lever, the longer part of the
lever is where all the force is placed, thus the force would be multiplied
by the leverage... Unless of course the backspacing of the rim manages to
get the forces centered squarely between the bearings... on a beetle axle
the short part of the lever takes the force, so less will be transmitted
to the bearings? (i'm not an expert, but from contemplating the RGB Vs bug
swingaxle setups, the forces seem more balanced in the bug one... I am all
ears for an expert opinion.)

So, i'd say the 4 bearings *may* be to make stuff stronger, but i'd say
&quot;definitely&quot; would be going too far until we could have a competent
mechanical engineer weigh in on the subject (not me to be sure.. i'm just 
an amateur)

take care,

Steve
