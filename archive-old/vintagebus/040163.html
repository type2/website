Hey Derrick,

Loosen up the little screw on the points and postion the points against the 
distributor shaft at the lobe w/ your .016 feeler guage in place.  You want 
that gap setting to hold while the lobe it pushing on it.  After the points 
are good and screwed spin your motor and make sure they open and close and 
have the proper gap.

Hope this helps,

Eric

the points do not open and close.  I'm following the points
&gt;adjusting procedure as suggested by Mr. Muir, and since one of the first
&gt;steps is to check how the points open and close, I can't move on to the 
&gt;next
&gt;step! &gt;Derrick Pacheco
