[...] does anyone own a service manual other than me? 




&gt; &gt; When driving in a straight line, my steering wheel spokes are at 1 &amp; 7
&gt; &gt; o'clock.
 'cos it is a keyed shaft, I can't see how to
&gt; &gt; get them to 3&amp;9.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't this have to be adjusted from the point of view of the
&gt; tie rods?
