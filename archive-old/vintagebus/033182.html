ITS SUPER EASY to just take out the window assymbly whenever you want and PLUS
you have a TRUCK they should fit pretty good in your magical TREASURE under
bed hideaway.  just don't put any bolts in the window assymbly and then you
can pull them out or put them in whenever you want. how hard is that?
