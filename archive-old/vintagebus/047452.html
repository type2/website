This is the only message I've been able to find for 'm.putman'.  

Apparently this was the message which caused the young lady such ire.

  I just read your Sermon about Freeway Fliers and I am hoping to be able to
drive my bus with some regularity, but a commute to work for me involves 2-3
miles and only 35 mph! :-) THIS speed and distance is okay, right?  I agree
with you in making it as close to original and new as possible! :-)  Thanks
for all of your helpful info (very good for new girl-owners like me! )

 Michele,
 
 Driving an antique occasionally is surely better than letting it languish in
the garage.  However...
 
 The fact I have forty years experience with Volkswagens, a shop full of tools
and spare parts up the wazoo makes it practical for me to drive an old bus
literally any where I want to go but it has become obvious that my occasional
trip reports have given many a false impression of the durability of old
Volkswagens.
 
 Firstly, the fabled reliability of early-model Volkswagens is nothing more
than a reflection of the service they receive, and they are high-maintenance
vehicles, requiring ten times for preventative maintenance than the typical
modern-day vehicle.  Secondly, the skill-level needed to perform that
maintenance is about two orders of magnitude higher than any you'll find at
the local quickie-lube.  And finally, the price of brake and suspension parts
is rising steadily while many body repair panels are already unavailable.
 
 The bottom line is that unless you're qualified to do the maintenance
yourself, keeping an antique Volkswagen in-use and on the road is liable to
cost you more than a luxury vehicle.
