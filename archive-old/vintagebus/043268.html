&gt;
&gt;When I brought my 66 camper home a couple of months ago, it had 
&gt;absolutely NO working lights.  [...] Now, the last NON-working lights,
&gt;which may be the most important, that I need to fix are the Oil temp
&gt;light, GENerator lights, and Speedo light.

The Muir &quot;Idiot&quot; manual has a good procedure for the oil light and the
generator light.  By the way, the oil light is an oil *pressure* light,
not oil *temperature*.  Anyway, the main thing to realize about both
of these lights is that they should have power from the ignition switch
at the speedometer, and are grounded by the oil pressure sender and
voltage regulator respectively to turn them on.  In other words, the
switches are in the ground side of the circuit, not the hot side as
is more common.

By &quot;speedo light&quot;, do you mean the general illumination bulbs so you can
see the speedo at night, or the green arrows that flash with the turn
signal, or something else?  If you mean general illumination, then you
have to look to the headlight switch and associated wiring.  If however
you mean the green arrows, then all three of your broken lights (speedo,
oil, generator) may share the same problem - a missing power feed from
the ignition switch (circuit 15).  The green arrows work the same as
the other two - they get power from the ignition switch and are grounded
by the turn signal flasher in order to light up.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
