Subject: re:stuck drum tool

I haven'thad this problem before, but I have needed a puller before-for my
lower pulley last time. Anyway I just got mine at my FLAPS(A*t*z*ne) They
had a pretty cheap one, that I could borrow. They take a deposit, then give
it back when you return the tool. Basically it is liking buying the tool
then returning it(except they know in advance what you are going to do) I
ended up keeping mine, it cost about $20, it isn't very good, but good
enough for that odd time when I need it. If you think you will use it a
lot-try something else....

good luck
