Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?
To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My garage has the '58 Westy, tons of broken landscape equipment (grrrr!) 
while my Porsche is living outside with a car cover, my Blazer's paint is 
starting to peel up from over exposure and all of the good landscape 
equipment is destined to live on the work trucks.  Something has got to 
change around here...I think poor Mike is coming home on this Friday to a 
very long &quot;Honey Do&quot; list for the weekend.

Cheers Type II Owners!
