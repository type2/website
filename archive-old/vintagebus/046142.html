&lt;&lt; My friend is having problems with his battery severly corroding to where 
he has to clean it off every week to get the bike to even start. I believe 
it's a new battery but doesn't the changing weather have something to do with 
it and proper ground. &gt;&gt;
Hi Cory,
There is at least three possible causes.
1.  The voltage being generated is too high causing the battery to boil too 
much and forcing acid out of the battery.
2.  Refilling the battery too full with distilled water which again causes 
the battery to over flow acid all over.
3.  Not properly cleaning the battery posts and cable clamps with a water 
baking soda solution.  Soak cable clamps in the solutrion and wipe the posts 
and top of battery with paper towels soaked in the baking soda solution.  
Carefull not to get any baking soda into the battery cells!

  For any VW owner using a battery box to contain any acid from the battery 
from getting to the VW sheet metal is a wise move!  Do not be fooled into 
using the chemically treated under battery mats.  They work for a little 
while, then the acid overcomes the nuetralizing chemical, where upon the mat 
turns more and more acidic and becomes your worse enemy!   Eric&amp;Barb
