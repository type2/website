The Wolfgang ones are so misshapen I'd be surprised if you could
get glass in them and get them to assemble.

&gt; I do believe Wolfgang makes some though I dont think the quality is great but 
&gt; that is NOT thru personal experience, only based upon what friends have said. 
&gt;  Dave Palmer from Creative Engineering also makes some but I have yet to see 
&gt; the quality.  Personally if they aren't that far gone I would rather have 
&gt; them blasted and such.
