&lt;&lt; Way to go Clara. I have often thought it should be fairly easy to test
 this. Weird thing is Gene Berg supposedly did some testing and said that
 they made the engine run hotter. I don't remember for sure but I think I
 remember reading that. I don't see how. Someone mentioned trying to keep
 the aircooled engines cool sitting &gt;&gt;

Actually I email gene Berg asking for any tips or info.   I got a reply 
saying they'd sent me some articles if I sent them money.  they also said that they 
found the scoops made the buses cooler.

hm, were you talking about scoops, or an electric fan in front of the regular 
fan?

It's been in the low 90s the last couple days here.  Now my bus gets up to 
170 to 180 oil temp just putting round town on a quick errand.    I might even 
install the drivers side safari on my 61...
