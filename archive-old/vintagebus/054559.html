&gt; Mike &lt;turkisbus_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; asked:
&gt; Why is it that almost everyone who has a puck, seems
&gt; to tow it behind a camper of some sorts?? If your bus
&gt; is a camper, why do you need to pull one too?

&gt; Start with a ratty single cab, an agreeable girlfriend who is a &quot;sport&quot; a

&gt; Stay home and watch NASCAR. Drink beer. Wear
&gt; headphones. Disconnect web access to save money. Drink beer- what ever is on
&gt; sale- when you can escape to the market. Advertise Puck on VWPlanet. Dream
&gt; about owning a ratty single cab.
