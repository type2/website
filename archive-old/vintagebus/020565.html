Subject: 61 westy for sale B I G project
To: list bus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

On my route a spotted this 61 westy. Used to be swr,
used to have safaris, used to have flip seat interior.
Missing lots of stuff, the guy said it runs and
drives. He asked me if 600 was fair, I said sure,
never called him back. Its in Sacramento. Total
project. His number is 916 247 0594, but I forgot his
name.

Good luck
 Mike
