There were quite a few probing transaxle question and answers in the past
with a well informed but now gone (and not so well remembered) listmember.
The point being that to properly re-build a transaxle the cost of the
desireable replacement parts would run into the mid-hundreds of dollars
and when you include reasonable labor costs of qualified people that a
cost of 800+ dollars might be expected. 
To re-do a tranny for 450 a significant number of parts would have to be
reused which would make me a bit wary. Of course a careful shop might
select only the very best of used bits and reject any worn or marginal
parts. But we have the GEX model as an example. 
So Caveat Emptor.

(This is by no means meant to disparage any supplier but just as a warning
against false economic pitfalls)
