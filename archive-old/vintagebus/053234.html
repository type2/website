Subject: problem in italy

With the mechanics help I contacted the local
&quot;in-charge&quot; yesterday. Apparently someone else put
claims on the bus just one week ago but no one has
heard from the man since. He has another week to have
the camper removed from it's stagnant location and
then it is up for grabs again. Once again, I will let
you know...and thanks for the additional help the
other day...I've chekced things out more thoroughly
and yes, it is easier than I thought assuming the
other interested party doesn't follow through.
