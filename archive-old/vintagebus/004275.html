&gt; does anybody have any info on this modification?

The bay window beam into split has been discussed ad nauseum. Plenty of info
in the archives. For a brief synopsis, it goes like this. 68-69 beam bolts
into splitties. 71ish torsion arms fit into said beam. They have disc
brakes. Simple bolt in except that the front of the bus will be a couple
inches higher. For another flavor, the Westfailure has a late bay beam in it
with vacuum assist disc brakes. Top two bolts into original holes, bottom
had two new holes cut into beam flange to match holes on frame. Bolted right
in, no mods to the stretched and boxed V8 Westy frame. Standard drag link as
near as I can tell. Will need to go to dual circuit master cylinder,
proportioning valve seems to be based on peoples tastes. If you search the
archives you can read about disc brakes, bay beam swaps, and VeeWee's
detailed descriptions of the dual circuit master cylinder conversion until
your eyes bleed.
