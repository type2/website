Subject: Re: [VB] plugged riser = burned rod coz why?

&gt;From: vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org (craig k)

&gt;
&gt;...i had a question about a muir Statement of Law, ie: plugged heat
&gt;riser = burned rod. 

I can't find in my Idiot book where he mentions throwing a rod on his
engine and linking that to a plugged heat riser.  He does mention it
under the &quot;Other Diagnostic Considerations&quot; heading at the second or
third page of the &quot;Engine Overhaul&quot; chapter, saying just &quot;A plugged
heat riser will cause a rod to burn.&quot;

Just thinking out loud about it, the accelerator pump is there to
give the engine an extra shot of fuel when the throttle is opened
quickly.  It needs lots more fuel Right Now or else it stumbles.
If the pump isn't working it doesn't get the fuel, but even if the
pump is working, the liquid fuel still has to be mixed with air
to burn.  The heat from the heat riser would tend to help the
liquid fuel from the accelerator pump evaporate - if the heat riser
was plugged, the fuel may not evaporate so well and the engine
still stumbles.  In effect you're running lean, which probably means
running hot, which might be the &quot;rod burn&quot; connection.
 
I don't think the heat riser is big enough to cause exhaust back 
pressure considerations if it gets plugged up.

I don't know if any of this is right but I figured I'd throw it out
here.
