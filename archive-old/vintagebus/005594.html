Interesting site that has tones of &quot;grate&quot; boot legs of dead shows. I had to
go to the FTP site and down load all the shows I could find that I had
attended in a VW Bus. http://www_dot_deadshow_dot_com
I then burned them to CD's. I plan on sending the CD out to be copied to -
believe it or not - 8-track, for both of my busses have them. I think all
pre 1972 buses should have a nice 8-track tape player in there dash and
surprizingly ebay is a cheep place to get them.
Please don't flame me, or kick me off the lists, I realize this should have
probably been sent on a Friday.
Be kind
Shawn
