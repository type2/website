Subject: Busses by the Sea 2001 Update!  Now there's a website.

I cant believe its taken me this long to post this.  Having a child will put
the world on hold I guess.

THE WEBSITE IS FINALLY UP! http://bus.beachin_dot_net  All the info including
directions and pics are there.

If any of the attendees from last year have pics of last years event please
email me the url, I'd like to link back to you.

I'll be adding info to the site regularly as I answer more questions from
people that I forgot to include.  Please remember to email me if you are
planning on attending so I can keep the Campgrounds updated.
Also, if anyone would like to help out I'll need a few hands to haul wood
for the Bonfire on Assateaque Island Saturday night.  Here's the info one
more time.
