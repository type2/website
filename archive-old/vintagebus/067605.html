Subject: RE: [VB] more heat questions

I assume it was fresh propane-it was a brand new container, i just bought
for this use. The Procat I got was from t*rget_dot_com. Approx $85. I think I
will return it, and put the money towards a  real VW Heater, which I assume
will not smell so nasty.

Kevin,
  Did you use fresh gas? If it was old, the fumes probably leaked off
leaving
the nasty smelling parts. Or the supplier put in cheaper componants.

  I have no expertise with any of this, just helping explore the
possibilities.
The high here will be about 65f+ !

  After the last time the Procat came up on the list, I looked on e-bay. A
dozen or so new ones for sale, wholesale cheap.
