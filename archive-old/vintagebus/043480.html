&gt;The wiper motor in my bus seems to not work anymore.  [...]
&gt;Looking at the moter, it doesn't seem to be anything all that 
&gt;special. It seems like, with some minor mods, that some kind of 
&gt;generic 12-volt replacement could be put in it's place.

The '63-'67 Bentley says you can replace the brushes in the motor.
Have you tried popping it open and checking for obvious trouble -
broken brush wire, worn brush, etc?  An electric motor shop is
the &quot;official&quot; place for brushes but a well-stocked hardware store
should have a selection of power tool brushes that may work.

For advanced trouble, you may have to find a sympathetic motor
shop or junkyard.  You could either take the rotor assembly out
and have it rewound to 12v, or take it out and browse the cores
of other DC motors until you find something that will work.

I'm assuming that you've bench tested the motor sans linkage.
My Dad noticed that the wipers were getting tired on his
'74 Bug and was thinking expensive thoughts, like a new switch
or motor.  One weekend he took the wiper arms off, all those
seals and washers, etc, polished the *rust* off the shafts,
lubricated the shafts and the rest of the linkage, reassembled,
and wow!  Speedy wipers once again!  We should all be so lucky... :)
