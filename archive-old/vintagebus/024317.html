Subject: RE:  throwout bearing - update

&gt; Well, I verified it.  I did indeed order, receive, and install the
&gt; clutch kit (pres. plate, disk, TO bearing) that Bus Depot sells for the
&gt; 71-79 bug.  I should have got the one for the 62-70 bus.  
&gt; 
-SNIP-
&gt; 
&gt; So, what do you all think?  Can I get by with what I've got?  It seems
&gt; to work, but feels a little wishy-washy.  Will I damage anything (other
&gt; than the clutch itself) if I continue to use it?  Such as the clutch
&gt; operating fork or the transmission itself?

My vote is fix it now! Doesn't the &quot;newer&quot; Bug throwout have the square
tabs and rectangular clips? I don't see how it could align properly. 

If it comes apart while you're driving, you may trash the cross shaft,
pressure plate, maybe the clutch disk, throw crap into the starter
housing, and leave yourself stranded or dry-shifting. As is sits now,
you only need the throwout, pressure plate (get one with a center ring,
so I'm told) and retainer clips. For the time it takes to pull the
engine, I say bite the bullet and fix it now.
