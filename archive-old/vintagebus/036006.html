  It's in London, the guy just brought it in from Portugal, LHD I believe,
it's a Kombi, semaphore bus, has Safaris too. Theres a lot of new metal let
in, like the whole floor &amp; chassis, the top corrugated bit isn't on yet, New
bulkhead complete etc. etc. Some big holes where metal has been cut out for
repair, like around the rear wheeltub (there isn't one). Whoever is doing it
has welded in some box section bracing bars to keep it straight, so a half
decent job at least.

	Sounds interesting, I might know someone. Where is it Damon?? RHD?
Kombi?
	As I'm sure most people on the list would agree, you can't have too
many
	projects sitting in your garden!!
