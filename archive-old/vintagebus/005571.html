Subject: Re: [VB] windshield, ventwing glass prices?

I generally pay about $50.00 US for all of the glass from a scrapped bus.
Usually a mix of logoed and non-original glass. This is obviously at the end
of the swapmeet, when the seller just wants to go home without reloading,
but that's is all I'd pay for the whole lot. No, I ain't selling any. I give
it away when it pleases me, and I use it when I need it.

&gt;    I am needing both front windshields and the passenger side vent wing
&gt; window for my '67 kombi.  I have a friend who has all the pieces but
doesn't
&gt; know what to ask.  Of course, I want to get them as cheap as possible but
I
&gt; don't want to rip him off.
