If you take the bleed hose and go UP prior to going
down into the bottle, any air coming out of the brake line 
will go UP to the top of the loop and not back into the bleed 
fitting when lifting one's foot off the brake, further easing the 
one person operation.

Greg,
The air rises to the top (duh) so you have to bleed from the top bleeder
to
get all the air out.  However, the dirty, contaminated brake fluid is
heavier than clean fluid so you must bleed the bottom to get all the
dirty
fluid out.  I use a clear bottle with a hose from the bleeder into the
bottle.  That way you can just open the bleeder screw and slowly pump
the
brake pedal to pump the fluid/air into the bottle.  You don't need to
close
the screw between pumps (as long as you pump very slowly).  You can see
the
fluid change color as you pump the dirty fluid out until it flows clean.
This method also allows this to be a one person job.  Be sure that the
hose
extends down into the bottle far enough to be under the fluid level.
You
have to add a little fluid to the bottle to be able to do this when you
first get started.  Be sure you don't pump the reservoir dry or you'll
have
to start over.
goforit!
