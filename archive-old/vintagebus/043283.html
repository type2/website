Subject: Bought me a 65 Neunsitzer!

Well, the Jerome karma must be some powerful mojo, 'cause last Wednesday
night I was showing my event photos to the gang at the Tallahassee Vintage
VW's monthly meeting and moaning about how driving Ellis's '63 from PHX 
to Jerome had given me the yearnin's -- and someone mentioned knowing
about a '65 bus for sale, just on the market, cheap....

Around these parts, splitties don't go on the market too often and the
ones that do are usually trashed, rusted, or &quot;improved&quot; -- but I took a
look at this one &amp; couldn't turn it down -- almost complete (except for
rear interior), and pretty original, straight &amp; low-rust, with pretty good
mechanicals (12v conversion). So for the first time in 18 years, I'm a
splitty owner!!

I think it's a neunsitzer (model 2212) - non-walkthrough, lapbelts &amp;
popouts just like the M-codes say (what's 002 or 425, anyone found out?).
Delivered to USA, W(ilmington?), paint codes velvet green/blue white
exterior, mesh gray interior, though at present the whole car is basically
grey primer on the exterior.  Seems to have original floor mats, original
cardboard luggage area floor, nice looking original upholstery on the rear
of the cab divider.

Needs a minor amount of rust work -- cab floor, right rocker, battery
and one area in the cargo floor, plus some surface rust on the roof,
raingutter, and popouts.

Popout frames are a little rough and the rubber in them is to laugh, so
I'm mulling over the possibility of replacing them with the six westy
jalousie assemblies I (presciently?) pulled from a junkyard last Feb. if I
can do so without major boogerage.

Anyone got spares of the following:
washer reservoir
blockoff plate (yeah, sure)
ashtray for cab divider
1 popout latch
square key
gas cap (yep!)
right visor
door pulls

--if so, drop me a p-mail.  That's the short list.

This is a driveable car and I got it for what I consider a real good price
-- only fly in the ointment is my wife sez I have to figure out which of
the three (60 Ghia vert, this 65 Neunsitzer, or my 71 Westy) will be
parked &quot;elsewhere&quot; now :-(  AND my college freshman daughter is eyeing it
with serious lust.  In fact both wife and daughter have shown more
interest in this one than any of my other cars.  Must maintain
ownership....

Anyhoo, had to brag.  This thing really fell in my lap so I'm still not
feeling the full impact -- but tickled to death to be driving a splittie
again!
