Subject: Oil light always on

Well, almost ready to start the DP 1600 on the floor for its run in.
I've hooked up a speedo with an oil light so I can make sure its got
pressure.  The problem is that the oil light would not turn off after I
cranked the motor over for 5 seconds or so.

I removed the switch and oil shot out of the hole, so I assume there is
some pressure.  Possibly I've not hooked up the light correctly.  Here
is what I did.

Hooked sender (mounted in block) to light bulb connector (installed in
speedo) via wire.

Hooked power wire to positive spade on speedo

Grounded speedo to - terminal

The light is now on.  Will not extinguish with engine cranking.


I checked this with a new switch and grounded the switch and then
actuated the switch to simulate oil pressure.  The light always stayed
on.  Could I have two bad switches or am I hooking this up wrong.
According to my wiring diagram this is correct.  I know this is simple
stuff folks, but I'm stuck.

Steve
