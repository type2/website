Any fellow listees out there used POR 15 paint?
I spoke to the distributor here yesterday and he recomended using it as a
sealer/undercoat in the bus roof gutter,as well as an underbody paint,engine
bay paint etc etc.
Would it be advisable to use a seam sealer in addition ?if so under or over
the POR?
How does it react with other topcoats and is it as good as it sounds?
Any experiences or opinions would be appreciated!

Thanks
Phil
