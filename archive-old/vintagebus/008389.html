Ah well I missed last night so here's the latest:

As you all know, I cleaned and painted the front window frames.  After 5
hours of drying time, the POR15 was still tacky so I moved on to other
things.  First I reinstalled the wiper shaft grommets, then the wiper motor,
speaker, radio, and the speedo.  I also cleaned up the windshield squirters
and reinstalled them.

Now when I went to hook up the Sapphire, I got to thinking about the
backlight and how it's 6v.  It'd be quite a hack to control it once I
convert to 12v so I took apart the radio and installed a 12v bulb.  Now I
can have my dash lights dimmed and not worry about the light in the radio!

Pretty much it for now...
