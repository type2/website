I am looking at the front and rear bumper assemblies (complete) and the
complete exterior trim (belt line and rockers) that I have had for some
time.  I am wondering how much they are worth now.
They are in very nice condition and I am thinking of selling them.  Maybe.
All replies appreciated.
later
