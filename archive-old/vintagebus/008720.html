Subject: Verification of Urban Legend?
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2000 19:45:37 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Today at work, on the table lay 3 duplicate emails that some kind soul
printed out with intent to distribute.  I was wondering if it's urban legend
or not.  The title of email was, &quot;How to Eliminate the Loss of Points on
your Driver's License.&quot;

Supposedly the author of the email verified this with a buddy of his that
works on DMV computers or has done programming on them.  What you do is say
for instance, you receive a ticket for $75.  You send in your check for an
amount a tadbit higher than the fine like $82.  The DMV will then issue you
a refund check but when you receive it, never cash it - just sit on it.
Supposedly the incomplete transaction never finishes it's removal of your
points.  Sounds plausible yet hokey at the same time.  By the huge list of
forwarded email address headers on the printout, I'm sure a handful of them
were cops.  Act fact, these deals won't last long - you know what I mean.

Anyone have and comments on this?
