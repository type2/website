Would any kind soul have connection information for the main harness that goes
from the cab to engine compartment on my '67 Split? The guy before me painted
the interior, and disconnected everything! I've got the schematics, but it
would be a lot easier if someone has got the connections involved with that
particular harness as well as colors.

I found a smaller 3 wire harness(cloth covered) running down the drivers side
which looks like it was added by a previous owner, but its cutoff at both
ends!

Is there a drawing of the bus somewhere which shows the harnesses and where
they run? I checked the archives and couldn't find anything.

Thanks kindly.
