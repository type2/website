1963 Double Door Panel ex-Lone Star Beer delivery truck. I'm the 4th owner. 
Still has original Lone Star paint job on the outside, factory blue inside 
cab and engine compartment. Has cab divider, radio block off, and original 
seat covers. Little rust under windshields and bottom of cargo doors. Front 
floors will get some POR15 to keep them from rusting through. Never been hit 
(hard). Rear Bumper is a little bent. Engine and front beam/brakes have been 
upgraded to later model (65) 1500cc. Has some electrical gremlins that I 
haven't tackled yet, otherwise runs and drive excellent.
1961 Westfalia.  About the rustiest bus I've ever seen (next to that Samba 
Ronnie had) Bought it for $75 only because it had a Blaupunkt 3 band 
radio/amp combo.
Anyone want to buy it?
Thanks,
Brian
