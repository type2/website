Andy,
         I've done this like 10 times in the past 6 years.  My first try I 
sent the plate, waited three months and it was authenticated.  Then I moved 
to Jax.  Tallahassee is part of my sales territory so I bring the plates in 
myself, wait 30 minutes and then they are authenticated.  So, yes, you need 
to mail the plate, however I would try to go there myself.  You would save 
the three months  that it took for me to get my first one.  If you like, I 
could do it for you.  I have authenticated plates for two of my other 
friends.  I think I need a copy of your registration, the plate and $33.50?  
Somewhere around this figure.  Your choice.
Drive 'Em

&gt;they killed the collectible plate (all cheer!!)
&gt;I have tags. white on red for 68-69
&gt;blue on orange!! for 64. i bought them for like 20.00 each the problem was
&gt;getting info on registering them. jerry Dasson sent me a copy of the paper
&gt;explaining it. from what i see you have to send the info to tallahassee?
&gt;is this right? It says to send a description of the plate. is that ok or
&gt;do I have to send the actual plate.
&gt;tell me how you did it to ease my way.
&gt;thanks
&gt;
