Subject: EveryBus shirts - last call!!!!!

Howdy y'all...hope everybody is getting ready for EveryBus this
year...should be another fantastic event...
Anyway, if you're planning to pre-order your t-shirt &amp; dash plaque, which
I strongly encourage, as the few I will have onsite usually are gone
within half an hour or so after my arrival, then I need to have your
orders in hand by Friday, March 25th, which is 1 week from today...so get
them in the mail ASAP! Thanks to the folks that have already sent theirs.
Information, pictures, prices, etc on
http://www.teamspatula_dot_com
on the tshirt page...

www.everybus_dot_com
See you in a few weeks!!!
