Subject: RE:coffee cup holder for vintage bus?

Was questioned:
&gt;I am wondering if anyone has designed a cup holder for a 67 or older bus. I
&gt;wish I had one in my 57 double door van. How are you all dealing with this
&gt;popular accessory?
&gt;Dave

At Wally world or the like I picked up a couple of cup holders designed to
mount through the air conditioning vents of a &quot;regular&quot; car. I replaced
the clamps that hook into the vent with a couple of long bolts and rubber
washers for spacing and protection of the dash paint. I made several and
gave them away to my Buskatier buddies. The angle can be adjusted to meet
the curve of the dash and will support a regular can/bottle no problem.
