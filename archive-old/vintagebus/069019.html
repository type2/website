Subject: RE: [VB] Shocks for a 63singlecab

Check for original shocks!   


Especially on that westy.   8-O



Sam asked:
I have been thinking about shocks lately as there have been several
threads 
about them.
My 63 singlecab, driven 95% of the time unloaded, must be getting to
need new 
shocks. Any suggestions?
