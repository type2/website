[Selling]
 Thanks Samba.

AUG-GY, 60 crew-cab

the one bus you always said,...  I'de never sell it
&quot;dude&quot;...... &quot;Told&quot; your O.L..... she could leave
before you would sell your bus,... shit.... now i have
to eat those word's. Goes down tough.
 
It left Ore, today bound for far N.E.


I know this truck will remain in the U. S.A. &amp; thats
important to me, it will be used in the manner it was
intended to be, as working truck, not abused, kept dry
in the winter. Not sure if the new owner will feature
it in his web site.www.pinkneystudios_dot_com 

 it would add a another element of class.
