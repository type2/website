Subject: RE: VW vendors (was CB &amp; Oregan ect.)

Before this thread gets killed, I thought I'd put in my recent experiences.

I'm not so sure I should go into great detail, but I recieved this same
kind of &quot;rude&quot; customer service on the phone as others have described. The
vendor in my situation was Komet. I'll never do business with them again.
Oh well. I was just buying junk from them anyway. I guess that's what I get
for investing in cheap stuff. Enough said.

On the other hand, I recieved GREAT customer service from RMMW. I hadn't
done a lot of business with them because of there high (IMHO) prices. But
getting treated well on the phone &amp; have the stuff at my door within 2 days
was worth the couple of bucks extra.

I also want to comment on the great pre-customer service I've recieved from
Todd Hill. He answered my questions &amp; gave me great suggestions. When I get
done with the '59 &amp; start my '62 deluxe, I'll DEFINATLY be getting a tranny
from him.

Vendors should really be aware of how much affect &quot;having a bad day&quot; can
have on their business. Word of mouth is everything. And now with the
internet, all it takes is a few keystrokes to let people all around the
world know how someone has handled his customers.  In my opinion, there is
no excuse at all for treating a customer bad.

My 1 cent.
