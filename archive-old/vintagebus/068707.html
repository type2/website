&gt; I wonder why people go mad for the small round mirrors and usually shy away

Hi Mike,
We tried the larger present day aftermarket elephant mirrors and had problems 
with them wiggling at highway speeds so badly that one could hardly tell what 
was being seen in the mirrors.  Went to the small round mirros, no wiggle and 
plently of vision.  Plus the smaller mirrors do not block so much vision out 
the wing windows and are more aerodynamic! ;-)
