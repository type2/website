&gt;[Rebuilt tranny] Second gear has a little bite to it until the oil has
&gt;warmed up some, then it smooths out.  Finally, third gear has popped
&gt;out about five times in 300 or so miles of driving.

Transmission mounts OK and torqued to spec?  Shift-rod coupler and rods 
OK?  Joint at bottom end of gearshift greased?  You can adjust that plate
on the cab floor around the gearshift if it's hard to get into gear
and/or if you think it may be contributing to 3rd popping out (like if
you can't move the gearshift far enough into 3rd to get it *really*
well engaged).  Just loosen the two bolts and slide it around.  There 
may well be other things but most of these you can at least inspect and
possibly fix without pulling the tranny again.  :)
