 Ya, I'd sure miss an event because I had a couple of windows that didn't
have the logo on them!!!! DUH!
 Sometimes I'm more amazed at the people on this list everyday! Thom, keep
that non-logo glass you offered up; If I need it to get a splitty on the
road I won't care what it says, or doesn't say on it! Don't need to attend
that show very bad do you Frankie!?
