&gt;I have the first New Beetle Turbo sold by my local dealer, just &quot;had to 
&gt;have
&gt;it&quot; and 24,000 miles later I still don't regret it. I have never confused 
&gt;my
&gt;reason for buying my NB with my reason for owning 2 air cooled beetles and 
&gt;3
&gt;split window buses.
&gt;You will never see my '66 Westy  or my 64 convertible sitting in remote
&gt;parking at O'Hare, but my NB is there about 30 per cent of the time. I 
&gt;don't
&gt;expect to get what I paid for my NB, because when I sell it, it will be 
&gt;used
&gt;up.
&gt;My NB is an appliance, something I bought for utility and service. The
&gt;aircooled VW's are in a different league altogether.
&gt;I enjoy you guys who drive your buses exclusively, but that's not my life,
&gt;it's yours.
&gt;I'd like to have a new microbus too.
