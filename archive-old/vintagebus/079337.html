Subject: Re: [VB] oil relief plug removal help

Hi Don,
The treaded plug that keeps in the spring and oil relief piston, is steel in 
an aluminum and magnesium alloy engine case.  Because the differances in 
metals the threads between these two parts corrode slightly which causes a press 
fit.  To remove the plug take a hammer and give it three good raps.  This will 
vibrate the corrosion so it gets powderized, and the plug will unscrew easily 
unless someone cross threaded it before!
