Well I decided to go against the advice of many listees and local gurus when 
they had told me to run a starter relay to solve my problem.

My brothers westy has this relay on it and for obvious reasons.  Spaghetti.  
But my kombi has nice almost untouched wiring and had never had a problem 
like this before.  In my mind if the bus has been starting for 30+ years and 
then finally decides not to, there is a problem.  Intalling the relay would 
just be a quick fix, causing me to ignore the true problem whatever it may be.

So not wanting to add extra wiring and the relay I set out on an adventure.  
I first started a couple months ago at the fuse block then moved back to the 
starter and battery.  Each time I would clean the connections it would appear 
to be fixed.  For a little while.  Then it would start doing the same thing.  
Not starting.

So after each failed attempt I would get a little closer to where the problem 
actually was.  I removed the ignition and a previously broken connection was 
cracked again (bad soldering job by me) so I repaired it again.  I worked my 
way forward this time from the battery to the fuse block.  Checking ech 
connection that I could get ahold of.  

Well a couple days ago I got it.  FINALLY.  Appears to be a combination of 3 
bad connections.

1.  ignition switch connection broken.
2.  2nd terminal from the right on the top at fuse block loose making bad 
contact.
3.  bad connector at selenoid.

After repairing and or cleaning and re-crimping these connection, the bus is 
starting each and every time and quite fast I might add.  

Not saying anything is wrong with relays really, I just HAD to find out what 
was going on.

Happy as heck that my bus starts again!
