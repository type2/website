Subject: Re: [VB] importing goods to USA

I sold a '66 Westy Dormobile to a fellow from Cincinnati Ohio back in the
early 90s. Anyway, he took it across a low traffic border crossing, told the
US customs official what he had and what he paid, plus the relevant duty.
The US customs guy couldn't find the regulation highlighting the duty and
ended up charging him $50 to basically get him out of away. I seem to recall
he should have been charged 4+ times that amount, but can't remember
exactly.

Subject: [VB] importing goods to USA


&gt; I have been asked by a number of people in the last few days about
importing old
&gt; cars to USA from CANADA
&gt;
&gt; I have no personal experience doing this,, but I do know bringing a 25yr
old Vw
&gt; Bus into CANADA is extremely easy,,
&gt;
&gt; Mike Moore pointed me to this page which has a great deal of information
on
&gt; everything,, not just cars
&gt; http://www.customs_dot_ustreas_dot_gov/impoexpo/impoexpo.htm
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has personal experience with U.S. Customs at the CANADIAN
&gt; border,,especially with Vw's over 25yrs old, it would be nice to hear
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
