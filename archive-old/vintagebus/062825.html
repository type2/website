Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio

  It seems that mosy people who run the 356 pully also run at 3000-3200
rpms, which in turn would probally be the same as 3800 with the stock pully.

  I did a simple test with fan speed in my bus. At 3800 rpm's it was blowing
air out of the defroster vent like no tomorrow, as I increased my rpm's the
air started to slow down. At 5000 rpms it was almost half of what I had at
3800

Hey Ronnie,
Do you or anybody else who has maybe done the math, know the % change in
fan speed using the 356 pulley?  I was thinking since I was now running a
3.88 with late reduction boxes, 215/15 rear tires that maybe that would
take up the slack and I would turn slow enough.  I do cruise at 3700
though.  I have a 914 engine in it now but am running a standard T1
fan/alternator.  I know you aren't too partial to using 356 pulleys, but
if you gear way up the engine is making more heat along with pushing less
air from dropped rpms.  I ran the thing up Tijeras canyon 80mph the other
day and it probably got 240-250.  Maybe this isn't that bad for T4 engines
though.
John

&gt; you run the Porsche pully and the engine at 3000 rpm's.  I would be afraid
&gt; of handgernadeing the fan and don't want to spend the money for a welded
&gt; one. I have had fans start to come apart on me before.
