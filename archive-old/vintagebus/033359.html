&lt;&lt; Can anyone confirm the interchangability between the cooling fan of
 a doghouse shroud vs a standard upright?  I have a pile of standard shrouds
 and just found a doghouse shroud but it is missing the fan.  Someone told
 me that the old uprght fans were wider.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
You have to use at least a 33mm wide fan and a 35mm works much better.  The
earlier you go the thinner the fans were.  The measurement is taken between
the two discs of the fan on the outer edge.  Also suggest converting your
doghouse tin to use the type 4 cooler that is 40% bigger than the doghuose
cooler.   Eric &amp; Barb
