Subject: Re: [VB] Carb and manifold take-outing


&gt; Short answer:  ... you
&gt; really should pull the motor to change the manifold.
&gt;
&gt; Long answer:  You CAN change the manifold without pulling the motor,  I
&gt; suppose, but you would be doing yourself a great disservice!  ..... e&amp;b


&gt;actually, I have swapped the manifold boots on a DP with motor in situ, and
&gt;feel it is easier than pulling the motor.  if you have a DP, you can do it in
&gt;situ.

i just took out/replaced the SP manifold today - engine IN car!
no trouble at all. i also replaced my gen brushes, cleaned out the heat
riser, and put in a NEW carb. finished just in time to turn the key and
drive across town for the local veedub club meeting!

if the motor had been out, it would still be sitting there, with me under
it, wrestling it in, until after the meeting.

score one for the half-assed way :)
