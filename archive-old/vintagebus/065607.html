Subject: Re: [VB] 50MPH Whine--??

Hmmmm,

My whines a bit too, just about at identical speeds to those described 
by Jerry.  
It's not a horrendous whine  - its a slight but noticeable whine that is 
not
there at other speeds.  But apart from that the tranny  is smooth AND  
smooth shifting.......it was rebuilt (by moi - I have the tools for 
setting and measuring R&amp;P backlash)..

All rebuilt reduction boces with good gears and new German bearings.....

A very experienced tranny builder here said this often happens.  He claimed
that when you re-adjust the R&amp;P to factory specs (ie take some of the slop
out of it) the ring and pinion are taken out of their 'established' wear 
pattern
and that some noise results....I am sort of waiting to see whether they  
'wear in'
again...............

&gt; I say the whine is most likely from the ring &amp; pinion. My tranny had 
&gt; very little whine prior to rebuilding it. I wanted to put in the 
&gt; freeway flyer r &amp; p. I did and still am doing the job myself. I love a 
&gt; challenge. When I put in the new r &amp; p, the tranny whined from 45 mph 
&gt; to 55 mph. I did not rebuild the Reduction boxes. The tranny whine 
&gt; seems to decrease (or increase) with the adjustment of the pinions 
&gt; shims and differential shims. I am currently disassembling my tranny 
&gt; to re-adjust the backlash (changing the differential shims) and 
&gt; hopefully further reduce the whine.

&gt;&gt; Starting at 45MPH, I get a whine  loudest at 50 MPH  NO WHINE Under

&gt;&gt; When I have it at 50MPH with the whine and take my foot OFF the gas
