Hi Kevin,
Yes, they bolt to the same studs that hold on the sump plate.  Yes,  one has 
to tie up the cord to keep it from dragging.  They work very well  and are 
needed if you park somewhere in arctic weather, but of course you need a  120 AC 
socket.
 
Here is some being sold on thesamba_dot_com

  We think they will not fit the type 4 engine.  Will fit 40  HP through 1600.
