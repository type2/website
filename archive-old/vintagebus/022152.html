I want to remind everyone that Das Kool Bullis, the Florida chapter of 
NEATO, is hosting Bulli Brigade 6 this Saturday at Reeves Volkswagen in 
Tampa, FL.

They have a web site at:

This is always a good split bus show and there is also a big all VW show 
on Sunday about 45 minutes north of Tampa, so it makes a good VW weekend.

Peach State Transporters will be leaving the Atlanta area headed for the 
show on Friday morning.  We will be cruising slowly down I-75 South if 
anyone wants to hook up along the way.  I think we will meeting David 
Raistrick &amp; Charlie Ford at the GA/FL state line &amp; we will probably hook 
up with a couple of people in Gainesville, FL as well.

If anyone else is planning to travel down I-75 and wants to hook up and 
caravan, get in touch with me so we can set up a meeting place.

Dave
