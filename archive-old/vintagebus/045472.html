Judson will not fit in a bus post-barndoor unless you dont run an air cleaner.
Okrasa will fit post-barndoor no problem unless you want to run a Abarth 
exhaust.
It will not fit barndoors unless you notch the gastank.
Yes okrasa=expensive.
P-mail me with any other ?'s.

&lt;&lt;OK, tell me that I'm stupid....


I'm starting to look at what engine transaxle to put into my '59 and I found

a top end Okrasa kit containing the heads and carbs....  Would the carbs fit

in a '59?  I have talked to several people about putting a Judson in a bus

and was told there wasn't enough height so I question the carbs on this kit.

Also, anybody have any experience with Okrasa stuff?  Is waaayyyy over

priced these days?


Thanks
