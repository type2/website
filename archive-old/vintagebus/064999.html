&gt; After experiencing the lack of heat from Dansk HD boxes, I want to clean

I've had good luck with brazing rather than welding.  Since the metal is
thin, brazing is somewhat safer.

Don't try to weld the thin housing to the tubes.  They were not done that
way originally.  The metal was fashioned into a flange the surrounded the
tube closely.  Heat, vibration, and corrosion destroys the flanges,
leaving a raw edge.  My solution to this was to fashion a split ring from
1/2 inch wide 16ga steel that surrounds the tube.  Slide the split ring
into the gap between the box and the tube and braze into place.  The wide
bearing surface of the split ring will last longer than the original
flange.  Mine is still excellent 8 years after the work.

 Is
&gt; there any way to have these chem dipped, or should I just wire wheel
&gt; them down and paint? Was hoping I could find  a place to dip them, if
&gt; that's ok, to clean up the insides.

Not a bad idea, but be sure that the dip doesn't attack metal.  I just
degreased mine and painted them with rattlecan paint.  The occasional drip
from the valve covers keeps corrosion away.
