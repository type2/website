I still have ~30 of the original www.type2_dot_com window stickers. These are
dark blue ink on shiny silver Mylar and they are absolutely indestructible
and fade-proof. By convention they are placed on the lower left corner of
your rear window but of course you can do what you want. I have no
intention of ever printing another run of these.

We'll send one sticker to each of the first 30 contributors who send $5.00
or more to Steve. Enclose a mailing address.

Steve thinks we're flush but we need RAM, guys. Pony up. =^ )

&gt;The address for contributions remains:
