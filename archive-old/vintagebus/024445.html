&gt; I have been driving my 66 bus for about 6 weeks now and I have noticed that
&gt; my shifting has become much more stiff than it was.  I do not pop out of
&gt; gear at all and have not heard any wining or groaning from the tranny.  I do
&gt; not seem to have any problems finding gears either.  I do, however feel that
&gt; it is becoming increasing stiff and am concerned that this trend might
&gt; continue.  I also hear a rubbing or crunching type noise just behing the
&gt; bulk head when I move the shifter around into all four gears.  Kind of
&gt; sounds like rust.  Any help is appreciated.

I recomend crawling under the bus and having a look at the front trans
mount (fif). Especially if it's easier to shift after you back up. When
the front mount breaks, the shift rod ends up carrying the load and that
makes it hard to shift. Backing up makes the front of the trans lift up
and reduces the load on the shift rod.
Yes, it's a big job to replace that mount. I've done it without *totaly*
pulling the trans, but every bolt was loose. The engine was out too, of
course.
