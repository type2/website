Subject: VW Authorized Dealership Inspection

Just got back from the VW Authorized Dealership Inspection.  Didn't go as well
as I hoped.  The person who made my appointment said &quot;yes you can&quot; to so many
things, pictures etc .. Dropped off my bus .. she filled out the paperwork ..
then the service manager called me into his office .. closed the door and said
&quot;I smell a law suit and VW does not want to get involved.&quot;  In any case .. NO
.. I could not go in and take pictures of the bus when it is on the lift.
They did an inspection and here is what they wrote.

FLUID LEAK ENGINE

Customer states that she had her engine re-built and after having the engine
re-built she noticed engine oil leak.  The aftermarket shop said they replaced
the case.  Customer has concern about the after market shop doing what they
said they did.  Please advise.

Tech found a small leak detected at the case half where it meets with
transmission.  Small leak detected from overflow tube.

That was ALL .. There were also some notes not on here, that I was not allowed
to photo copy and it would not fit into the space given for her to type on my
invoice.

I jotted it down.

Something about rust near the steering box ....
and rear axel snubbers are gone.

Diane
