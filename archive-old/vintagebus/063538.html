The 1600 DP in my 71 re-acts EXACTLY as you describe. FWIW!

I have a 65 bus running a basically stock DP1600.  Only non-stock items may be
Bocar 34/3 carb (with a 137 main jet) and electronic ignition.  I have a temp
guage connected to the rear pressure relief valve.

My question is,  when I cruise down the HWY (55 +/- (mostly -)) temp on the
guage goes up to maybe 210.  When I am idling or driving around town temp only
hits 180+.  I realize that my guage may not be calibrated correctly, but my
bus is obviously running cooler in stop/go traffic than on the freeway.

These conditions were observed today, outside temp was about 78-80.

Is this abnormal?  What could be the cause if it is?


Enjoy your day!
