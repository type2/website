Well I got all your emails together, printed them, got my Idiots guide, and
wrestled with all the wires under the dash. My wiring is so bad that wires
lay freely all over the place. To make a long story short, it's the wiring.
I put one wire that had a clamp on it with another wire and finally viola,
it turned over. My new neighbor came out to see what troubles I was having.
He was be able to get the front headlights to go on, but then not the back,
and visa versa. He went somewhere and got a new switch for the headlight.
Of course that was the last of his efforts, but hey, I was happy. I got a
switch to put in.

For tonight my good friend and neighbor is loaning me her huge Dodge truck.
 I am thankful for such a support seem over the Internet. It helped so
much. And my neighbors are great.

I guess I'll need to get the wiring all redone. Wires are everywhere. And
you would not believe how they are connected, but after that I'm going to
get it painted.

Thanks for all the advice, almost everyone had the same advice and it was
good.

Peace,
Tara
