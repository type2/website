The thing people need to remember is that Bentley has to pay ROYALTIES to VW
for the right to reproduce there books, so that cost has to be factored in,
which also corresponds to amount of books printed and with VW on the warpath
they have more then likely raised their royalty fees!

[Disclaimer: I have no connection to Bentley, or any other publisher.
I do have a reasonable understanding of the economics of the
low-volume printing business.]

Most of the cost of the manual isn't in the printing, it's in the
labour of getting a clean, 100% complete set of scans.  The profit
margin on books really isn't all that high.

I also suspect you haven't actually done any significant copying/
printing at Kinko's (or any of the other print-from-computer-media
services).  I've done several different newsletters over the years,
and found that they are actually pretty expensive.  The only way you
can come anywhere close to break-even with the cost of just buying a
book is if you already own your own high-quality copier, and are
willing to ignore the cost of paper and toner (the &quot;copy it at work&quot;
approach).

Then there are the legal issues.  Unless you have some sort of
&quot;special&quot; relationship with someone at Kinko's or wherever, they'll
refuse to print anything from an obviously-copyrighted work.  This is
usually even if you have a written release in hand for doing the
printing - they've been hit by a couple of copyright-violation suits
in the past, and it's just not worth it to them to risk another (the
legal fees are pretty high, and the awards are even worse).

There's also the observation that Bentley is unlikely to grant
permission to print anything off of such a cd, since it would then
become very difficult to prove the difference between someone printing
a single copy for themselves, and someone from buying one cd, a cheap
(i.e., low-quality) photocopier, and selling a bunch to people he
knows.  So, printing even one copy legitimately becomes a bit
difficult.  It *might* fall under &quot;fair use&quot;, but I doubt you could
convince a judge of that if you printed the whole thing.  Specific
pages as needed, sure.

Finally, I would note that Bentley's price could be reduced some if a
large enough number of copies were guaranteed to be sold.  There's the
fixed cost of producing the book in the first place (scanning,
printing plates, etc), and the incremental cost (actual printing).
The latter is what the above discussion has been about, and doesn't
really change until you start getting into the thousands of copies
range.  The fixed cost, however, has to be amortized over all the
copies that are expected to be sold (we'll ignore the problem of the
cost of over-printing and storage of same).  Let's say fixed cost of
production for the number of copies they stated as a minimum comes out
at $40 per copy (not all that unlikely, really).  If you double the
number of copies that are guaranteed to be sold, then that $40/copy
becomes $20/copy, and the list price can drop by the same amount.

I doubt Bentley would tell us what the fixed cost is, but it might be
worth asking what the retail price would be at a guaranteed sales
quantity of their current minimum, twice that, and so on.  The
blue-skey theoretical upper limit on sales would be the number of
buses from those years that were built.  The realistic theoretical
upper limit is the number of buses from those years that still exist.
The actual upper limit is some fraction of the latter, and can be
estimated by comparing sales volumes for Bentley vs all the other
manual vendors for other years - the ratio is likely to be about the
same.
