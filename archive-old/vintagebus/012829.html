&gt; 1) How likely is it that damage was done to the rods
&gt; or head bolts by my
&gt; attempt to start a hydrolocked engine?

If you were just using starter power to turn it over,
I doubt it would have done any harm...

&gt; 2) How likely is it that &quot;something&quot; caused the
&gt; float to stick?  (Note,
&gt; there was no gas filter, but the tank had recently
&gt; been cleaned and sealed)

With no filter, very likely. Something as little as a
grain of sand could have got hung in the needle valve,
but I didnt think the fuel pump would allow one way
siphining... anyone?

&gt; 3) What do I do with the remains of the mechanic?

If your taking back to the same guy that F'd it the
first time, someone might have to think about what to
do with your remains:)

Later
