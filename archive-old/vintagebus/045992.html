&lt;&lt;As sad as it is, it appears the general consensus is that it is shot, and

I'm not one to disagree. Too far gone for me, so I'm parting it out now.

There were 3 people email me before about parts off of it, and I have since

built a new (1gHZ) computer and lost all my old emails and such, so if still

looking, I am officially parting it out now. I believe the sunroof to be

gone already, as is maybe the decklid and rear apron, but everything else is

still up for grabs. Oh yeah, bent door handle is spoken for too.

:-)  Keep BUGN,
