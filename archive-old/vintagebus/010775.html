I have to weigh in on this WOT thing.
To add more confusion, it was always W.F.O. to me.
The other thing I don't think anyone has mentioned is the
speed governor that should be between the carb and the intake 
on transporters.  I've only seen a few of these on very original
busses.  Most of them got taken off and thrown away very early
in life.  Does anyone have experience with them?
