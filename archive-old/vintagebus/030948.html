Yep!!
Gene Berg = Racer
 The Berg 5 and I somewhat quote here &quot;gives maximum cooling by creating the proper
RPM's&quot; basically you get a stock 1st, stock 2nd, and an in-between 3rd for use while,
you guessed it racing down a 1/4 mile strip. This way you have no low RPM's while
shifting between 2nd and 3rd, at least that's what Berg says, and I'm not going to argue
with him. It's just not what I'm looking for in this case. I have thought about it, and
I may go that route if nothing else works out, but I really wanted a taller 5th for
cruising on the freeway. No freeway flyer out there can compensate for 195/55/15 tires,
especially when been pushed by a a 2007 cc motor, not exactly &quot;mild&quot; as Mr. Pillow
stated.................
