IMHO if the bus get used for its purpose, camping in this case, does it
matter where it gets used as long as it is enjoyed by its owner, taken care
of, and kept from the crusher? Besides the Japanese need something to haul
around all the '57 Les Pauls they bought up:)

&gt;im just wondering what some of you guys might do if you were in my spot,
&gt;and what your views are about our buses going to another country, far
&gt;far away.
