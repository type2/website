I want to clarify what I had said earlier.  It seems several of you think
I'm driving around in a bus with a burnt up clutch.  I'm not because here's
why.

When I'm stopped on a hill and getting ready to take off, I do all the steps
so fast and fluid that one can't even tell I'm actually going through
several steps.  It's not like I have the new-driver's look on my face - head
cocked listening for the engine, tongue working around in my mouth helping
me think through the steps, and that dull glaze staring ahead getting ready
for the vehicle to move.  It's just like this:

Right foot on brake, tranny in neutral, clutch out (to save on throwout
bearing)
anticipate flow of traffic, push clutch in, wait split second for tranny to
wind down, shift info first.
let out clutch just to the point engine loses rpms ever so slightly then
immediately take right foot off of brake and move to gas pedal
finish letting out clutch and resume normal shifting and accelerating

When executed properly, there is no burnt clutch and most importantly, none
of that amatuerish rolling backwards at 20 mph before you decide you need to
hit the brakes and try again.

Sure the E-brake thing works great but show me where in a driver's manual
where it advocates the use of the e-brake in this manner.  I would actually
go out on a limb here and say my driving practice would probably be endorsed
by VW themselves, driving instructors alike, and chances are you would find
it mentioned in a manual somewhere.

Okay, well maybe not that far...:-) :-)  In the end it really doesn't matter
but I wanted you all to know that when I do this procedure, I don't burn
clutches.  I've driven Li'l Red (74 Super) and my 67 bus this way for a
cumulitive total of 50,000 miles and still have yet to replace a clutch.
Matter of fact, Li'l Red's pedal freeplay has never changed since the day I
put the engine in and adjusted the clutch.
