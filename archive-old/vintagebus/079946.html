Subject: Re: [VB] 65' Splitty single port, redid alot, no start, help

I'd double check the points (.016) and static time it (depends on what dizzy you have) Are all of your leads hooked up to the carb as well? Do you have gas in it? Recheck your plug wires 1-4-3-2 ect. Maybe you aren't getting gas? It could be a stuck float.
