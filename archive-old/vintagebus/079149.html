Subject: RE: NEW Side Tent  $199 with Floor - OFFER ENDS SAT.

I just received word that our container of side tents has cleared
customs, and is scheduled for delivery to us on Tuesday.  

Accordingly, the $199-with-accessories list member offer on the tents
will end Saturday evening.

For those of you who have pre-ordered one (or are about to), our plan is
to have them out the door via UPS within a few hours of when they
arrive.

Toll-Free for Orders by PART # :  1-866-BUS-DEPOT 


&gt; For anyone who orders one right now, I'm going to
&gt; include the sleeping cabin and ground sheet FREE 
&gt; with the $199 tent. This is a price that I doubt I will be 
&gt; able to offer again.
&gt; 
&gt; You can see info and pics on the tent at the following link:

&gt; 
&gt; You can get this deal by ordering at the following link:
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=A0097  It will 
&gt; come up at $229.95. But enter Referral Code TENT on the 
&gt; checkout page and it will drop to $199.95. As always, you 
&gt; will not be charged until it ships (around May 1).
&gt; 
&gt; This offer will end when 20 have been sold (or 3 days before
&gt; the container arrives, whichever comes first).
