Hello everyone.

My name is Kc Holmgren. I am a new member on this list. I own a 66 Dormobile
bus and I live in Minneapolis, MN. I'm driving it this winter. To answer
your question - yes, i might be a little crazy. But we Minnesotans have
tough skin. Plus I found a great electric space heater. Anyway, my bus is
100% Dormobile. No Westy interior. It has the Martin Walter camp box above
the engine. The only things it's missing are the &quot;Dormatic&quot; seats and the
table (the ONLY thing, ;). It needs bodywork anyway so that's why I'm
driving it this winter. I will get that taken care of in the spring or
summer hopefully. The pop top hinges above the doors and it has a
green/white candystripe canvas. as opposed to a red/white canvas. If any of
you have any other type of Dormobile, I would love to chat with you. Also if
any of you know where to find the missing seats and table, I would be
eternally grateful. Even if it's just like one or two of the seats. It also
has a BN4 6v gas heater. However, my bus has been coverted to 12v and it is
sitting dormant right now. Have any of you ever done a voltage drop on a gas
heater? Is it safe? I can only imagine the horror of the voltage drop
failing. 

I also have a website that you can check out at
http://www.limekey_dot_net/dormobile. There are pictures and info and the whole
bit there. There is also a message board. So you can tell about your bus or
share stories. This is a great list. I like what I've seen so far.
