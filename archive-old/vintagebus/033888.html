&lt;&lt; Hello all,
 I have a question about my reverse light.  My bus is an early 67 westy.  It 
 has what appears to be an added on backup light on the driver side rear 
 bumper tube.  This bus has only been owned by two other people. The fellow I 
 bought it from had the bus since 74. He told me the PO (now deceased) 
 assured him the light was on the bus when he purchased it new.  Does anyone 
 else have experience with such a light on an early 67?  Could this have been 
 a dealer added item?  The light is quite deteriorated at matches the 
 condition of the bumber it was mounted on.  Thanks for any help.

I have been planning on adding a backup light on my 65 with the sitch in the 
nose cone and strapping a 67 bug reverse light to the bumper tube.      Don't 
know if that was an option or where I got the idea, but it is tidy and makes 
sense and a backup light seems like a nice thing, I certainly wouldn't remove 
it.

Yes a backup light was availble before mid 67, but I thought they cut them 
into the bus.   Ambulances came with them I believe, even barndoors, I think 
so.   Seen the light...
