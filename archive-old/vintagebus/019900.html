  Reminds me of a friend who knows nothing about cars. 
After a rain his car was squealing due to the belts 
getting wet. We told him it was the &quot;Muffler Bearing&quot; 
and he should get a new one pronto, thinking we would 
get a good laugh when he called Kragen about it...He was 
on the phone with them at least ten minutes &quot;Yes, it's 4 
cylinder, not a 6&quot;.
  BTW- What was the URL of that spoof of an autoparts 
site?

And *don't* let him sell you GL-5 saying it &quot;supercedes&quot; 
GL-4 -
every parts monkey I've ever talked to has tried this.  
As punishment,
I send him to the back for a water pump for a '77 911.  
I let them hunt
and scratch for about 10 minutes before I let them in on 
the joke.
