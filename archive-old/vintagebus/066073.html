Subject: Re: [VB] upright motor and 78 tranny !

The buggy guys do it all the time, but the input shaft is a bit longer and
will stick into the gland nut a bit too far.  You can cut 3/8&quot; or so off.
That tranny has some pretty tall gears for a stock 1600.

&gt; A friend of mine bolted a 78 tranny up to his stock 1600 upright ! Anyone
&gt; out there ever try anything like that? His only problem were the motor
&gt; mounts--Seems a 78 tranny is a little longer--! , TWWM, uj
