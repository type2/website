I thought I would take a minute here and plug Bus Boys.  For those of us
that have been on the list for quite some time, we well remember the bad
repuation that Bus Boys from Redding, California had procured for
themselves.  Skeptical at first, I decided to order a couple of small items
from them as a test but not before corresponding with Charles via email,
voicing honestly my concerns about the past rep. of the company.  Charles
told me that they are working hard to try to reverse the damage done by the
previous owners.  I also went on to let Charles know that I would attempt an
order, despite my skepticism, and that8 I would post a message concerning
the results of the transaction on the net on the vintagvw list and type2
list.  Whether that 8post would be good or bad would depend solely upon how
the transaction went.

I got a catalog from them (courtesty of Charles - a big plus!) and placed my
small order afterwards.  This was last Wednesday and I told the gal I would
like the items sent 2nd day priority.  With the holiday and all, the parts
actually arrived a half-day later than normal.  The post office will even
tell you on occasion that 2nd day packages might not make it until the 3rd
day.  Bus Boys did their part and sent the package out on the day that they
had told me (I checked the postmark - the ass that I am) so in this case
there was no one to blame except the Post Office themselves and ultimately,
since I specified using 2nd day priority2, my fault as it was the result of
MY decision that this happened.

As a result of this transaction, I'm going to report that I'm 100% satisfied
with how my first order from Bus Boys went.  I'm still quite partial to
Ronnie at the OldVolksHome as his service, prices, and free technical advice
is unmatched in the industry IMHO.

But let it be known that I think Bus Boys is trying to remedy their
situation and at this point, I would order from again because they were
nothing short of excellent in how they handled this transaction.

(I didn't get paid to say this or get a discount or anything that B.S. - I'm
just letting you all know FYI.)
