&gt;How do I find out if my buddies 55 SC was originally equipped with semaphores?
All his wiring (and everything else) has been changed. Thanks
&gt;
Possible research:
1. Semaphores = no front turn signals, have the front turn signals (if they
exist) been cut in vs a nice factory wiring hole?  No front signals ever
= semaphore Bus.
2. I'm pretty sure the non-semaphore Buses don't have the threaded screw
hole inside the cab for the semaphore mounting screw.
3. Wiring going down the posts in the Cab?  (Easily torn out, though, mine
was)
4. No holes for reflectors in the rear?  US model = reflectors below taillights,
Euro/Semaphore model = no reflectors.
5. Semaphore turn signal switch
6. Letter to the factory - get the original destination of your Truck
7. 2 wires to each taillight = US, 1 = Euro
8. Grinder to the seamphore posts, see if it's welded up.

#2 is your strong point, if it's true.
