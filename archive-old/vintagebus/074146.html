Subject: Re: anybody know this bus?

ronnie,
it sure looks like the deluxe bus that used to cruise around haiku, 
maui in the nineties.
same colors and interior, maybe even same rack. I used to see it all 
through the 90's in the same condition. Up close, it had some rust 
under paint bubbles (what doesn't on Maui though?) I had heard that 
they had moved to the big island (unconfirmed).
FWIW,
Andres
