&gt; Hey, was wondering if all the redux boxes were the same, and if not, how to
&gt; tell the exterior difference and if they're interchangeable.

&gt;From my experience, the only interchangability issues are
Big Nut vs Small Nut.  You can interchange them, as long as
you're interchanging the boxes as a matched set of boxes,
ie the individual gears won't mix.  The only issue is resolving
e-brake cable setup.

Barndoor boxes don't figger into the equation here.
