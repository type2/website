&gt; Yeah Ellis, we've heard it before, so you're too good now to drive a split.

Ellis spouts back,
Until the next one comes along... hahahaha! (no really)

Not &quot;too good&quot; au contrare! Just the opposite.
Not good enough would be more accurate.
Not enough time, energy, health (bad back) or income to afford the over priced
- under engineered repop parts and constant upkeep and repairs encurred through
regular use. I can't~ or choose not to~ hang!
Negotiating or begging an extra tranny from a buddy for $100. to $200 when he
needed rent, paying minimally for or snagging the engine out of a $200-400 rat
bus/bug and selling the rest of it for the initial cost... Ah, those were the
days. $1000.-2500. for dry and generally straight builder bus/bug or better?
Keeping in touch with the New Mexican busbarn mafia, regularly scouting the
mythical/legendary Phoenix VW junkyards- being able to scrub just about
anything that you needed/wanted on a Saturday morning? Grabbing the local
Phoenix newspaper before day break on the way home from all night partying only
to grab a cup of Circle K coffee  a pack of those heart clogging chocolate
covered donuts, a pack of 'Boro lights in a box ($1.25 thank you) and ending up
in New River or extreme edges of the Phoenix Metro area as the sun crept up
over the horizon? HELL YEAH~! =)
I can not afford $1-2 grand for a nicely done engine, $800.-1800. for an
end-to-end tranny or possess the parts/facilities/knowledge/time and stength to
build it up yourself? Yeah, in a former lifetime. In (my) current reality? No,
come on! F that!
Too good for that? Not hardly. I barely have time to flush.

I'm so old that I can remember when:
- Made in USA was a concept and a possibility,
- Marriage was a sacrament intended for baby making, 
- the Passion of Christ was in a book, 
- Republican meant less government, less spending and pursuit of honesty,
- and when &quot;tax and spend&quot; inferred support of Domestic programs.
