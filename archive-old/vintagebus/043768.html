&gt;What the heck is this thing, Here's the photo link: 
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/jbakerccymca/whatzit

That's a Ford-style starter relay.  It was probably added to cure a
&quot;hot start&quot; problem.  By the way, using the white background for the 
photo is a great idea and makes it much easier to see.

&gt;So I crawl back under there and look, this thing is hanging by 1 wire 
&gt;that is attached to the terminal on my starter solenoid.  Upon closer
&gt;inpection there are 3 posts on it and only the one is attached.

If it only had one wire attached to it, it wasn't doing anything useful.
At best it was inert (if the one wire that was hooked up is the one with
the long red wire in the photo) and at worst it was pulling a little
extra current from the starter circuit.
 
&gt;So is this thing an old hard start relay that was by-passed when the 
&gt;PO did that push button ignition thing???

Yes, most likely.

What this means to you is that if your current starter works or at least
tries to work without this thing, swapping in a new or rebuilt starter
is a straight replacement - just hook everything up on the new starter
like it is on the one you have now.
