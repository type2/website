&gt;&gt;  Why do oil pressures get up to 80 pounds when the oil pressure relief 
valve is  designed to relieve at much lower pressure, what is it, 30 pounds or 
so?   &lt;&lt;
Hi John,
When using an oil with too high of weight for the outside temp.  The  oil is 
way too thick, this not only requires a bigger relief valve hole,  but the oil 
does not lubricate the bearing surfaces as well until engine temp  warms the 
oil up enough.  
  You can see this at work by chilling a bottle of maple syrup in the  
fridge.  Then while timing this, pour it into a large measuring  bowl.  Pour syrup 
back into the bottle and heat in the microwave till quite  warm, but not too 
HOT.  Again pour syrup into the measuring bowl.   Same opening, same amount.  
Slower to empty when cold, and in the  engine the oil pump is going to be 
pumping the same and even more ccs per  minute.
