&lt;&lt; On the advise from all on the list, I took step one this morning by 
looking for
 the M-codes.
 The old man who owned this before myself, actually lived in the bus (scary) 
and
 he was a
 welder of sorts and &quot;removed&quot; the retaining piece of metal behind the front
 seats.
 Hence, no M-codes.
  &gt;&gt;
does it have the metal plate riveted to the right side of the fresh air vent? 
 what is the VIN?  do you know what year your bus is?  did it come with a 
headliner over the front seat?  Did it come two tone or one colour?
