Well, the high voltage that the coil puts out is certainly capable of
going through the insulation of the low-voltage wires.  The question
is, why were you getting high voltage on one of the low voltage lines
(assuming I'm interpreting which wires you're describing above
correctly)?  You might want to consider replacing the coil.
