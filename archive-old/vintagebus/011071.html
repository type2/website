&lt;&lt;  I run a 6v gauge in my 12v
 &gt; car with no voltage drop at all.  The gauge works fine, it says full &gt;&gt;
I dont yet have a gauge in the 59', but I have run 6 volt gauges in 2 
previous 66 buses converted to 12 volts with out any real problems. on one 
the needle was a little bouncy (comperable to my stock 67) and on the other 
it didnt hit the reserve mark until it was about dry. otherwise worked well.
