Did anyone look at his other auctions?  $10 handling + shipping for a tail light
lense!  $50 handling+shipping for a trombone!  and the worst... $15 handling+shipping
for a super beetle hazard switch!

Bus content:  Did any busses come with a locking decklid latch that I could
use for my 67?  Now that I'm driving my bus a lot more and parking it in public
places I don't like the idea of anyone walking up to it and being able to just
open engine lid &quot;to see what I got&quot;. If you've got one that doesn't include
a $15 handling charge let me know.;c)

okay,

this item is listed at $1.00, an early bus gas gague... not a bad starting
price, so i read the fine print... $25.00 handling charge PLUS actual
shipping....

how much handling could it take to put a fuel gague in a bubble pack and
drop it in the mail, i mean get real...  read that fine print people...
