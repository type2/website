Subject: Re: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

only time I ever gave a tow driver a big tip was when I had my lowered 15
window towed home. I had just bought it at woodburn and didn't trust it home
so called AAA. This thing was LOW. The muffler was under the bumper and I
could hardly fit my hand between the muffler and the ground. Guy shows up in
a flat bed as requested, looks at the bus and starts looking around the drag
strip grounds for scrap wood, rocks etc to get the thing on the truck.
Didn't scrape once, and he never bitched! I couldn't believe it.
When I mentioned how much I appreciated it  he replied that a big hispanic
guy taught him to do that when he jerked his low rider up on the truck and
damaged his ground effects.


We had a lot of people insist on
&gt; getting flatbeds.  For classic cars we usual accommodated the request.
&gt; Some people, specially punk kids with low riders, think they &quot;have to
&gt; have a flatbed&quot;.  Truth be know, a flatbed is not the best thing for a
&gt; low rider since the angle of the bed is too great.  Sure you can pile
&gt; wood to lessen the angle, but most tow truck flatbeds don't carry that
&gt; kind of stuff around.  We had several books for each auto manufacture
&gt; that described the best ways to tow their vehicles.  Very few list a
&gt; flatbed as the only way they can be towed.  The few times recently that
&gt; I have had my DC towed I have requested a flatbed (USAA not AAA).  I
&gt; guess I'm no different than those punk a$$ kids :-)
