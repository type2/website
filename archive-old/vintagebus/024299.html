Hi John,
Have a 66 mirco delux. When I removed the the old panels in it, there
was a fiber glass batting that was full of dust and in bad shape. I
didn't replace it, but I did use a product I found at a auto parts
store. It is an adhesieve backed sound deading material. I just put it
on the metal skin of the bus and covered it back up with the new panels.
The bus is very quite and road noise is very low. 
Clancy
