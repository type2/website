Perhaps you two could discuss this over the phone in a mature manner rather than post derogatory comments to the list. Sometimes it can be hard to describe parts &amp; things through email. Don't forget how much negative postings can seriously effect someone's reputation (both the poster and the postee).

Just a thought :-)

&gt; First, some background:
&gt; 
&gt; On 1/2/00, I won an Ebay auction for a NOS 6v Bosch regulator, which I
&gt; purchased from Dan Kinsey (ThatVWGuy) for $32.02, plus $4 shipping.
