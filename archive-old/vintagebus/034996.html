Hi Ric,
Best to run the 65 pounds pressure!  The tires you are using were not really 
designed for VW bus use in mind and thusly the old fashioned VW pressure 
levels could result in tire seperation.  Which is what Firestone is claiming 
about Fords recommended lower pressure cushier/softer riding tire pressure 
levels.  Plus with higher pressure and stiffer tires you will have better 
handling, especially in cross winds and/or when a semi passes you will not 
automaticly change lanes inadvertantly!   Eric&amp;Barb
