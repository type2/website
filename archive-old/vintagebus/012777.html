i think it is best to plan on any resto taking at least two if not three times
the amount of $ to &quot;resto it&quot;

any rust you can see there is generally at least double once you start digging

as others have mentioned arbritrary time schedules are just that

depending on your attachment to your vehicle it is generally better to buy
(what appears to be at the outset) a &quot;more&quot; expensive vehicle at the outset..
you will find they are generally cheaper in the long run than you resto which
you will nit pick for its 'autheticity/correctness blah blah blah&quot;

if you can't find a nice nos bus kicking around or can't afford all the $
upfront join the rest of us poor slobs and have fun going into debt :)
