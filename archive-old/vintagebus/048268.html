get to all the middle seats again this year,    just  kidding    john



&gt;&gt;

Yes, I'll be up there.
Don't worry about the middle seats......I'm tapped out with this rustoration.
I'll mainly be scavenging for the parts on my wanted list.
Now if you guys want to sell me more 75$ seats......I don't think I can pass 
those up.
