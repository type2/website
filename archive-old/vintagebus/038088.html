Subject: Taillight Change in 57?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Have been getting some conflicting information in town about when they 
changed the taillights from bubbles and removed the taillight from the 
decklid.  Some have said that the taillight was carried over into very early 
58 but i am skeptical.  Anyone have any idea?  Looking at my 57 dlx i notice 
that the decklid is indeed a non brakelight with a brakelight hacked into it! 
:(  So does anyone know tha approximate chassis # which this change occured?  
Just trying to get the bus back the way it should be

Drive your VW!
