&gt; George, that rips it. I'm pulling my kids and grandkids out of school and
&gt; sending them to your house. What's your address and how much clothes
should
&gt; I pack !

Geez, both an interesting and civil thread with differing points of view!!!
Love it.

If I follow Georges logic, then you would still lighten up the flywheel only
to a lessor amount, what about the point that was made earlier which is to
add a Berg counterbalancer! As the berg unit is smaller dia, would there be
a formula to find a balance point?
