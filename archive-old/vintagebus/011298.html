&lt;&lt;   I read a message earlier this week that worried me.  I have a split case 
 transmission in my 59 singlecab, which I was under the impression that was 
 made in Nov. of 59.  The message read that transmissions were changed to 
 tunnel trannys in May of 59.  I don't know my tag.  Will my Chassis # help?  
 416631  Do I have the right transmission?

the change was at CH # 469 447, may 19, 1959

your sc vin # 416631 was buildt in dec 1958, a splitcase tranny would be what 
it came with.
