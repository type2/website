Subject: I can't stop myself...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10009132019180.13053-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

But soon I will be able to!  The '64 Standard is getting shiny new
steel and flex brake lines and a new dual-circuit master cylinder.
I think I have most everything planned in my mind, but I still have
a few questions...

* For the steel lines, I think I want to use the type of tube bender
  that has essentially a pulley-shaped mandrel and a little stop.
  The line is retained by the stop and bent around the (smooth)
  &quot;groove&quot; of the pulley to the desired angle.  Is there another kind
  that will work better or is this it?  Any tips on how to use the
  bender, how to get the bends in the right places, etc?

* Eric&amp;Barb's directions at the type2_dot_com Library seem to indicate
  that I will need to cut the push rod (attached to the pedal) or
  fabricate a shorter one.  I bought the spacer kit from Wolfgang
  Int'l and their directions don't mention cutting the push rod...
  they do tell you how to adjust it but it implies I can still use
  the one I have.  What's the scoop?

* Should the spacer sit flush against the M/C flange?  The spacer
  is basically a huge aluminum washer, but the ID is not the same
  all the way through...it steps down and gets narrower on one end.
  I can get it pretty close to flush on the M/C, but the &quot;nose&quot;
  of the M/C hangs up on the narrower ID of the spacer before
  the spacer is flush.  Will this fix itself as I cinch it down
  during installation or is this a problem?  (I have the recommended
  71+ master cylinder, 211 611 021 AA, German ATE.)

* Can I slit the brake line grommets to get them around the steel
  tubes?  I got the tubes in a kit with fittings already on the end
  so I don't think I can slide them over the tubes.

I have done other brake system maintenance before, like new shoes,
bleeding, changing a wheel cylinder, and changing a master cylinder,
so I'm not totally clueless.  I just haven't done this big line-
replacement project before.

I thank all of you in advance for taking the time to read my questions.  
I don't want to annoy everyone *too* much, but the brakes are something
I have to get right or nothing else in the world will matter much at all.
