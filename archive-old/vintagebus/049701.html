I haven't seen the vents running from the front lip, but I have seen two
other variations:

The first was on a 67 pick-up. It had the pre-64? small rear window, with
air scoops on eityher side of the window and ducting under the bed to the
engine.

The second variation seems to have been quite common here in South Africa.
I've seen it on single cabs and double cabs. In this one the cooling air is
drawn from above the tailgates, via a box-like contraption fixed to the
inner rear of the side gates, attached to ducts into the engine
compartment.
