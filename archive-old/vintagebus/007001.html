A lot of the new lights (Christmas) that I have been looking at are now 12
volt and use a transformer at the plug, (fire safety) I guess.

&gt;Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?  I would
&gt;love to install some this season and maybe put together a Christmas light
&gt;cruise.
Easily done- use an inverter and any regular 110 V x-mas lites you choose.
duct tape the wire and use clear package tape on the bulbs to hold them
down.
make sure to apply the tape to a dry surface. maybe there are other better
types of tape that won't damage the paint, e.g. electrical tape ( comes in
colors, do a candy cane install.
