&gt;  I don't do something the bus has a life of about 5 to 7 years.  If I don't
&gt;  go through with a restoration how can I keep the old girl going?  I am not
&gt;  one of those show guys.  If I restore it it will be for the sake of the 
bus.
&gt;  But if I restore it will the bus loose its personality?  What do you guys 
do
&gt;  to keep the bodies up so they don't crumble around you?  In the past mine
&gt;  have always eventually hit the junk yard.  HELP!

well, around here there dont salt the roads, so if you dont do anything the 
holes in the front floor and the rockers just get bigger from rain leaking 
in.   So I replace windsheild seal.   I did paint my 65 westy about 3 
1/2years ago- ya I was a bit cautious for a while, but I got over it.   It is 
nice to have a shiny bus, and nice shiny new paint dash.  The bus now has a 
collection of tiny rock chips and chips where someone opened their door into 
the bus in a parking lot and a few cracks through the paint and both 
windsheilds are cracked from roads rocks.  Still looks real good though.  Its 
been sitting since April when I started driving my 15 window - lots of  
rocker rot, old bondo, holes in front floors, faded 40 year old paint, for 
the summer.    Looks as the weather is turned, though, I might park the 15 
window in the back shed soon.  I would love to fix that one up, just time and 
money you know.  But I'll keep it out of the rain I guess that  helps.
