 Ummm, these various numbers and stats are all very well and good, but
 how many of you have A) had your odometers calibrated, and B) had your
 speedometers calibrated?  Without the first, you don't know how far
 you are actually driving, and without the second, you don't know how
 fast.  For instance, given the optimism of the typical VW speedometer,
 you're probably only doing 5/6 of what you think you are.  Similar
 arguments apply to the odometer.  I used to think I was getting pretty
 good mileage, until I clocked the odometer against the mile
 markers....

funny thing is, when I have checked my odometer against the miles markers, I 
get 3% to 6% lower reading on my bus than the mile markers (depending on 
which rig.   There fore, my milage is off, but I am underestimating it.  
However, this would not make a big difference in my estimated MPG
