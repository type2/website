Subject: [VB] 34PICT&amp;Alternator fit =(
Message-ID: &lt;19991227210219.16535.qmail_at_web1203.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

After fhutzing with an old 34-3pict for nearly a year
I finally gave up and bought a rebuilt 34-3 from the
local Bad Attitude Parts flap. I sidestepped the no
warranty BOSCAR Mexican POS model. 
Bolted that new carb into place and was ready for
action. Valves, dwell, idle, and total advance specs
were all in place. New plugs, condensor and points for
general principles. I was tired of monkeying with this
bus and had tons of other things to do with my life
than to constantly wrench on my freeking bus. I was
going to get this sum-bish once and for all! &lt;It must
be the tools not the guy handling them- right? ;-) &gt;
Boom! now I can only get half throttle due to the fuel
(accelerator)pump volume rod adjustment screw/slotted
bolt and adjuster knocking against the alternator!
Pfft! I had never encountered this before. Not even
with the &quot;old&quot; 34 PICT carbbie. (A quick check in
between the last sentence and this one confirmed that
both carbs are identical-not some variation on the 34
models.)
The counter clown at the Bad Attitude Place said that
he had never heard of such a thing as the arm hitting
the alternator. He said that I must have something
messed up.
I checked with a few local friends who work in the
machine shop of the Bad Attitude Place and it seems
that the thing to do is to grind the crap out of the
alternator housing and the adjustment screw/slotted
bolt until both are clearenced enough to allow full
travel of the accelorator arm. Also this carb has a
deadly case of the infamous 34 PICT dead quiver when
coming out of a deadstop.

Question: Is this alternator &quot;clearancing&quot; action a
common practice? Am I the only one who is tired of
having to &quot;rig&quot; most everything that I buy-VW or
otherwise? Will clearencing the alternator housing
eventually detrimentally effect its performance-or
longevity? No, I don't want the '88 Buick back- quite
yet... I think I'll order my 80 over bearings now.
