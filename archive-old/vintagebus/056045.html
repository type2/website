Subject: Re:need to raise $15,000

I have sat quite through most of this discussion, and now its time to say my
peice. I got a cease and desist over a vw emblem i had been using on my logo
on the website. That afternoon after a days work i redid the logo and
removed it. I feel like i complied to them in a timely manner. I have heard
nothing out of anyone about anything since.  As far as that part goes, its
over and done with. As far as put your money where your mouth is as Rick
puts it. Thats easy to say when its not your damn pocket it coming out of.
Me, i have better uses for my money, as in shop stuff to make the parts that
VOA  don't  make or support. VOA will cut thier own throat in the long run.
I don't piss and moan and most people on this list don't either, but they
state how they feel.  All of us don't always agree with each other but we
get through it. I flatly refuse to catagorized as a pisser and moaner or
spend my hard earned money to prove somebody wrong. To be point blank and
rude anyone trying to prove him wrong has more money than they have good
sense. And Rick , i can't fathom your reasoning for even suggesting such a
thing. You might as well just slap the folks affected by the VOA stuff.
Ok i'm done and will say no more on the subject, here or in e-mail.
