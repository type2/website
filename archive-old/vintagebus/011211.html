Saw quite a few Pucks at the Bad Camberg, Germany meet last June.  I'm pretty 
sure at least a couple were 36ers.  Don't know how effective they were, but 
90% of all VW's in attendance were driven to the meet.

&lt;&lt; Wasn't the Puck designed to be towed by a 36? Has anyone tried it? I've
 been curious about doing just that...towing a Puck with a 36. Not that I
 have a Puck, or a running 36 right now for that matter...but hopefully this
 weekend I'll solve the latter problem.
