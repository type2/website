&gt; On my local campus, I ALWAYS remember the license plate # of the clown in
&gt; front of me (sometimes behind and to the sides); that way I can file a
&gt; hit-and run/leaving the scene of an accident  report on em... will make
&gt; their day interesting, if nothing else.

Unless the dent came from the next car that parked there after the one you
noted left.  Then your day will be interesting.
