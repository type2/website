Im looking to leave between 9 to 10 AM.  I have never been to Havasu, EVER!  
So I really have no clue how to get there.  If there are any parts you would 
like me to bring that you may need for a backup let me know.  I was planning 
on leaving late evening on friday so that we could pick up all those poor 
guys in busses on the side of the road :D but I dont think that will happen.  
I'll be leaving from west Phoenix too!

&lt;fingers crossed that there'll be no fuse problems since we're not going thru 
sunset point&gt;

I'll bring some extra fuses too.  It was the 25 amp right?
