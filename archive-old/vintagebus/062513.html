 This leaves a question about where the upright part of the
&gt; spring goes:  in front of the pedal pin, or between the pin and the
&gt; backside of the pedal?  I've tried it both ways and neither way seems to
&gt; provide much back-pressure to the pedal.  I had to guess that the spring
&gt; goes between the pin and the pedal because this arrangement at least
&gt; provides some resistance--but still not enough to be effective.

I had this same situation, &amp; finally found a rusted spring still in place in
a donor pedal I removed from a parts bus. It broke in half when I removed
it, but a new WW spring slipped in between the pin and the back of the pedal
like the og spring?  gave good &quot;spring back&quot; for my 63 DC.
