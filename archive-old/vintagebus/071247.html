Subject: Safair/Window drain idea??

If the problem of rust in the lower channel of the front windows is from rain,
and moisture, setting in there.  Why not drill a couple of small holes and
insert tubes.  The tubes could have hose attached and routed out one of the
holes in the inner nose and to the outside.  Anyone tried this before or think
it would help?
