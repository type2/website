Hey man, Undo the flexible rubber hose at the back of the wheel and see if
it lets go. If so you have a buggered hose. Replace both because they are
born together and should die together.
    Also if it lets go no dolley will be necessary.

I'm ready to take my bus to him for an
&gt; engine rebuild.  The problem is my front left caliper is seized, and I
blew
&gt; a plug.
