Subject: Re: [VB] Straight Axle Kit Question (Vintage Nazi's need not respond)

Was 68 a one only year, a conversion year from 67 to newer style or is
that just
what everybody is using.  Why won't a 69 of a 67 work?  sorry for the
ingnorant
question, I just haven't done this yet and am interested in dropping my
23.

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt; The spring plates are special hacks, if you are a compotent welder you could
&gt; probably do it. The axles tubes are slightly? shortened 68 long spliners,
&gt; and the axles are just that TIII/T1 1968er, long spline/long alxes. Axle
&gt; ends appear to be stock, but the brakes are useally tIII installed swapped,
&gt; so ebrake and cyl are in TII attitude.
&gt;
&gt; You cannot use the stock 68 tubes and plates, your wheels will hit stuff, I
&gt; am told.
&gt; This is based on the wolfgang kit I just removed.
