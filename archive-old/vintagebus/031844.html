First of all, new original style tube senders are still avaiable, I have
always had these in stock, even after the sender shortage. When you use a
float style sender in the tank  (OE VW) not the VDO for VDO aftermarket
gauge one you need to install the fuel gauge vibrator ala 68 and later type
1 in order to get an accurate reading. It makes me sick when parts vendors
pass on these float gauges for our buses when they know (or should) that
they will not work without extra ad-ons.

&quot;One thing your post makes me wonder if if you have a 15 gal tank and a
sender 
for a 10 gallon tank.   If so, once the gas level is below the sender,
it 
will read empty, but you will still have maybe 5 gal in the tank.  THis
was 
how the 59 truck I had was- the gauge only read for the top 10
gallons.    
The sender works fine for 6 or 12 volts, doesn't matter.  6V gauges do
often 
keep working fine on 12V but again I have heard it shortens their life.&quot;


--  Sorry to but in, but I didn't know that you could have a 15 gallon
fuel tank in a bus.  My 67 had a 10.5 originally I believe, and my
replacement was an aftermarket that only held 10.  Man, a 15 gallon
would be nice. 
    Back on the subject, my working fuel gauge does that exact thing! 
It reads empty when I actually have half a tank left.  I replaced the
original tube sender with a floating arm one.  Does anyone have this
problem with aftermarket senders that don't reach all the way down into
the tank?  Has anyone bought an accurate aftermarket sender that reads
accurately?  Can I bend it a little so that my gauge can be more
accurate on the lower half of the tank instead of the upper when I know
I'm o.k. on fuel???  ---J.D.
