&lt;&lt; Right reduction gear leaks a lot, the tire is splattered inside and out, 
along with the wheel well.  Will do a complete write-up once we get a house.

Hi Chet,
Whoa! Stop!  If a reduction seal begins to leak all too often it means that 
one or more reduction bearings are going or are bad already.  Plus since it 
sounds like you are moving out this way you most likely are loaded down which 
just means more stress on these bearings.  Best to fix things now, than to 
have it completely fall apart!    Eric&amp;Barb
