&lt;&lt; Anyway, the 67's engine is a stock H-series &amp; currently has some
 loopy-shaped extractor (great technical description, huh?) &amp; a dual
 chamber(?) Bugpack hunk-o-rust attached. I have heard some interesting
 things about this extractor design and think I'd like to replace it w/
 the same but am considering something other than Bugpack mufflers. I'd
 like to hear of other options. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mellisa,
Well if you are going to drive you VW below 4,500RPM and not drag race it then
the stock muffler is best.  It has the stock back pressure that will give you
better MPG and keep your engine cooler if you are using a rather stock 1641cc
or less engine.  Just make sure you are using stock sized carb jets for your
size engine and then see if you need to change them to get the fuel/air
mixture right.   Eric &amp; Barb
