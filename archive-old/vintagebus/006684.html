  The reason for the duel port center section is 1. 34 pict 3 carb fits  2.
Larger diameter then stock single port intake manifold for more flow, the
single port end castings are of larger diameter to mate to center section
and have I opened up the intake port on heads to allow for the flow.
   On my last big bore single port engine I was impressed with the bottom
end and the power, I have just had good luck with single port heads, I have
stacks (at least 100) duel port heads and 80 per cent of these have cracks,
whereas in my stacks of single port heads not a single one with cracks, this
tells me something.

ronnie couple questions.
why use sp end castings with a dp manifold? why not just use a sp
(simpler) manifold?
where do you find such things?
