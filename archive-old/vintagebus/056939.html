&gt; The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a
&gt; lumber yard for a VERY long time.  So it goes to
&gt; figure that the ignition key is missing in action. 
&gt; I will eventually get around to getting either a new
&gt; key or a new switch, but I am going to want to crank
&gt; it soon so i can see if the current engine appears
&gt; salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone could
&gt; tell me how to hot wire start thie bus.  I assume
&gt; you can jump a wire between between the battery and
&gt; starter some how, but does anyone know specificaly
&gt; how to do this? Maybe some of you California guys
&gt; have done this before! Just Kidding ;^)
