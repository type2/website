&lt;&lt;       Well here's where I'm at. I have 19 days left until my maiden
 voyage of 507 miles round trip to BNNTA. This is my first trip of any
 length in my bus, and I'm a little nervous. So far here is a list of
 things done in the last couple months to get ready. &gt;&gt;

Bro, stop worrying, its only 500 miles, ROUND trip. Your worried now and your 
at home, when you get to MO are you gonna be even more worried about getting 
back to your domicile? Do you drive your bus regularly? Doesn't sound like 
it, start driving it everyday, that will work out the problems if there are 
any. Oh yeah, fill up the tank before you go.
