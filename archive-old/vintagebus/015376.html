For $1700, it beter come with a freakin' *bus* attached!

I paid $1000 for my tent, whichI felt was on the steep side, but
sometime I have more dollars than cents when it comes to bus stuff...

&gt; Yup, $1700 is a steep price -- UNLESS this is an extremely rare,
&gt; never-heard-of-before, &quot;Privy&quot;-style tent with a FLOOR.  A floor that is
&gt; undocumented in the literature.  That might be interesting.  I'd suspect
&gt; the plastic floor is a K-Mart tarp.
