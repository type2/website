&gt;  right around the nosecone is a rod
&gt; coming out of the tranny and at the end of it is a
&gt; circular plate then... a space... then another
&gt; circular plate followed by the rest of the linkage to
&gt; the shifter. what exactly do i need to buy for this
&gt; &quot;space&quot;? whats involved in this as far as taking the
&gt; tranny out and everything. thanks in adavance

That space is where the rubber center of the rear shift coupling was. The
two flat plates are the parts it was bonded to. One must remove them in
order to put the new shift coupler in. Old style coupling, the new ones
don't look the same. I have always just disconnected the forward shift
coupler and moved the rod forwards to change them, although with Arizona
buses that may be easier than in other climates. Plenty of info in the
archives on the other procedures.
