A time to restore, a time to part out ...

This thread is interestingly timed for me; I've spent the
past couple of months renovating (not restoring!!!) my
Fleetline panel, while liquidating my huge collection of
(mostly scrap) splitscreen buses. This has entailed my
selling the better/restorable buses (57 Kombi, 61 double
cab, 61 Westfalia, 67 ambulance), and stripping and cutting
up the rest. At its peak, I had 21 splits in my collection,
and there were another six splits belonging to other people
stored in the same yard. Unfortunately my garage and storage
yard were on a plot belonging to my ex-wife, and she just
sold the property, hence my liquidating the collection.

Selling the buses listed above (all needing restoration)
financed the resurrection of my Fleetline panel, which I've
owned since January 1993 and was my daily driver for eight
years and 80,000km. I've finished reassembly of the
Fleetline and tomorrow I'll install the reconditioned engine
and then we're back on the road! I'll post pics as soon as
the van is finished. Meanwhile, the stripping is only just
beginning, and it's a major task; no fewer than 10
basket-case splitties to part out and hack up. I'll also
post pics of that little enterprise ...

Turn, turn ...
