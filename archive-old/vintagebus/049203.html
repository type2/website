Gene stopped by the house after buying his new Double Cab.  It's a nice solid truck.  I had plans to go check out the DC for Gene over the weekend, but had to go out of town unexpectedly.  So we compromised and Gene came down and called me at my office on the shop owners phone.  It was like trying the seeing eye dog approach.  &quot;Gene, check under here, now look under there.  What about those, how about that?&quot;  For some reason the shop owner was getting pissy because we were tying up his business line.

It's still always good to meet listmembers in person.  It makes being on this list all the more fun, not to mention meeting nice people with a common interest.

Long live the list, Buses and people that love them!

Robert
