&gt; All,
&gt; Some mechanical mate of mine suggested that it might be possible to
get an

&gt; replacing the gears with 2 the same size give a 1:1 redux box W/O
any height
&gt; loss etc. Has this been done? Is there any reason why not?

I remember this being discussed a couple of years ago.  Before you go
too far with this you should check the cost of producing the custom
gears (I recommend a seated position when receiving the answer) and
whether the geometry of the box will allow 1:1 gearing to fit.
