Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What shocks do you prefer

Hi Volks,
We agree with Joe Clark, that having KYB GR-2 shocks,  and properly wieght 
rated tires are much better than soft sloppy  suspension ride.  We also 
installed 1966-67 stock anti-sway  bar with the later suspension on our 1960 walk thru 
panel camper  conversion, these steps really helped to get rid of the erratic 
wind  blown powered automatic lane changes we used to endure.
