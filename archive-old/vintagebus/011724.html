&gt; Why not just use a battery cable terminal puller?  Less than $5.00

Naah, that would be _logical_!  :)

Here's the battery cable maintainance routine that I follow.  It's a
bit of work up front, but _much_ less in the long run.  Works far
better than those &quot;anti-corrosion&quot; rings they try to sell.

First, you need to get the cables off of the battery.  Loosen the nut,
spread the terminal slightly, and it should come right off.  If not,
the puller mentioned above will do the trick.  Safety!  remove the
ground strap first!

Second, you need to get the thing clean.  Best way to do this is with
baking soda.  Put a couple of heaping tablespoons of baking soda in a
jelly jar or somesuch.  Fill the jar 2/3 full with hot water.  Stir. 
Dip the clamp into the jar.  It will probably bubble furiously, which
is what you want.  Repeat with fresh soda and water until no more
bubbles evolve.  Repeat on the other clamp.

Third, if the battery terminals need cleaning, use a small brush and
the soda-water solution.  Be careful to keep the solution out of the
vents or filler caps, as it will damage the battery if it gets inside!

Fourth, everything needs to dry throughly.  Allow several hours or use
a hair dryer to warm things a bit.  Be sure to wipe the grease from
the dryer before replacing it in the location where your spouse keeps
it.  Be sure that there is no remaining water on the clamp where the
bolt passes through.

Fifth, you need to provide a protective coating.  I've found that
petroleum jelly makes and excellent coating.  Work it into every nook
and cranny of the clamps and terminals.  Any spots you miss will be
where corrosion starts again.

Sixth, reassemble the clamps onto the battery.  Allow the petroleum
jelly to spooge out when you tighten the clamp.  The clamp only needs
to be snug on the terminal.  Tightening it any more will only damage
the clamp (which is made of soft lead or brass)  It should be tight
enough that you cannot rotate it by hand with normal effort.  If the
clamp ends come together when you tighten the nut, spread the clamp
apart, seat it further down on the terminal, and retighten.  If this
doesn't work, the terminal is toast.

Petroleum jelly is an old trick that seems to have been pushed aside
in favor of other anti=corrosion methods.  Too bad, as it is the most
effective I've used.
