All wireing harnesses are made by bob at wireing works, Bus Depot, aircooled
_dot_net, old volks home, type 2 parts _dot_com, all get them from bob, this should
make your decision easier.
i sell them, stock them etc. but ship all overseas, if you buy from bob you
get his technical support.

well its time to make some decisions now that my shop is getting torn
down..
Where is the best place to get a wiring harness from?  Wireworks?  John
at Aircooled_dot_net seems to like his.  Ron at Busdepot? (He's got nice
prices :)

I'd like it to be cheaper (as does anyone) but I DO NOT want to have to
splice the thing to make it fit.  I don't have the time to do this.

Please advise.

Thanks!
