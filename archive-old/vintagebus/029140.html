Could that  be the one I looked at two years ago down in Costa Mesa?  This SC
was fairly rusty and it did have a smooth rear gate.  The guy wanted 2K for the
truck (he advertised it as a '60) and when I told him that he had a very rare
rear gate...he looked at me like it didn't matter.  Truck was more project than
I wanted.  Any here buy it?

&gt; Anyone remember seeing a 58 singlecab with a smooth rear tailgate running
&gt; around int he mid 70ies?
