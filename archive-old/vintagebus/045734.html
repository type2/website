Just my experience, but the only time I drove with my safaris in my '59 Westy 
and had them leak, was on the way to Jerome year before last when they 
weren't completely latched.  It was kind of cool watching the rain bubble out 
of the windshield, but as soon as I tightened them - no problem!  However, it 
doesn't rain too much in New Mexico.
