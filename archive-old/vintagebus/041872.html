&gt; &lt;&lt; thanks for the tip on the thermostatic bellows... i know i do have one, is
&gt;  there a way to tell if it is working properly?&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Yes, two ways.  One way is to check the thermostat to be shrunk down to 
&gt; about half the hieght of the bracket it resides in, when the engine is cold.  
&gt; Then drive around for at least fifteen minutes outside temps higher than 50F. 
&gt;  With engine still running and shifted in nuetral, hop out and recheck (by 
&gt; eye only!) the thermostat to see if it is swolen up to almost the hieght of 
&gt; the inside of the bracket.  The other way to check is to remove the 
&gt; thermostat and drop it into a tin can of boiling water and see if it expands. 
&gt;  This latter test with a thermometer is the best way to really test it for 
&gt; operating at proper temp range.

Be careful!  The bellows isn't supposed to expand further than its bracket
will allow!  If you use the boiling water test, be sure that the bellows
is mounted in its bracket to prevent overexpansion.
