There is a very small one used for heating a
cup of coffee/tea/chocolate, but probably would
be too small for anything else.

Check out an appliance shop, they have all sorts
of waterheater elements.  You will also need the
adapter that the element plugs into.  Find
out if the element housing can touch electrical
ground (probably) or not.  We had a couple of big 
ones in a 6ft x 6ft heat treating quench tank at 
a previous job.  Took overnight to heat up.

Is there any way to electrically warm the water in a particular vessel?  I
have a harbor freight parts washer, which uses a water-based solition, and
if I could warm the water, it would be MUCH more effective!

Is there something you can immerse into it to do this?
