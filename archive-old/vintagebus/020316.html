Does the trailing arm move freely when you lift the bus?  Check
that first - my '54 deluxe had this problem.  

Secondly, it could be one or more broken leaves  - my '55 single had
this problem. http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=torsion+springs

&gt; So what could be the source of this problem?  My thought is that it's 
&gt; shocks, or bad torsion leaves.  Probably the torsion leaves.  Or could it be 
&gt; the torsion arms?  I'm planning on having to tear down most of the front end 
&gt; to find the problem, just fishing to see if anyone had run into this before 
&gt; and had some words of wisdom for me.  I do have a bentley manual, it will be 
&gt; my guide for fixing the front end.
