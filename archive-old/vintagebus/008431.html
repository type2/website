Hi Eric...

I had a very similar experience with a '65 bug....it turned out (after I
lost all shifting control, and had to dig into it) that it was just the
linkage falling apart.  The bushing that connected the two parts of the
linkage (in my case, this was found under a little panel in the frame tunnel
beneath the rear seat) had become so worn out that the play was causing the
tranny end up in weird positions....after I replaced the bushing, all was
well.  This was after I had to drive home with my co-pilot holding a wire
taut that &quot;sorta&quot; kept the parts together!

Anyway, the symptoms you mentioned were the same...check your linkage!

Gene
