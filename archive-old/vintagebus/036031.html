&gt;    I over heard my wife tell her friend on the phone that she
&gt; didn't mind all my vws, ( 6 bugs, 1 bus), plus me spending
&gt; every available moment working on them.  She said at least
&gt; she knew where I was and that I &quot;didn't smoke, drink or hang
&gt; out in bars chasing women&quot;!

That's funny.  It's the opposite for me.  Im out there drinking and smoking 
and working on the cars.  But my girl loves it anyway.  She is just trying to 
get me to fix up her new beetle though.

Drive your bus if it has a Tranny!
