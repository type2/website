With the heavy loads he hauled camping and long trips, that engine was always
under torque and always into the hot area. His fan system evidentially helped
the normal engine compartment vacuum and dropped the temps back into a safe
area for long duration driving. Quite frankly, I wouldn't cool my engine down
that much for my short hauls locally, but if I was doing the long loaded
stints he was....

&gt; I'll tell you another one that gave me pause. A friend of mine years ago

&gt; fan. A little too busy in the engine compartment for me!

What was the condition of his engine seals?  I'd expect that this approach
would result in lower temps if it was replacing hot recirculated air with
cooler outside air, but if the seals were in good shape it wouldn't make
much difference.
