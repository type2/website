Subject: Re: [VB] Hello

get a copy of &quot;How to keep your VW Alive, for the Compleat Idiot&quot; by John 
Muir.  Has been in print since 1969, so is widely available at used book stores , 
but is about $25 new.  read it, it is highly entertaining.

check yr local papers and thesamba_dot_com, etc.   Find a VW club in your area 
and show up at meetings.   ask people who drive old VWs

Good luck and welcome!!!!
