&lt;&lt; but another listee mentioned they would still have to be replaced.
 And the bearing has two small indentions where I hammered it out, but this
 doesn't appear to rub on the races... Same listee mentioned I should replace
 the bearing as well. &gt;&gt;

do you want to get technical??  and have the cash to do it right??  take the 
drum out and clean it spotless.  if it needs turned get it turned now.  clean 
it out all over again.  buy new german bearings.  take it to a machine shop 
and have them pressed in properly. you wont have to replace these bearings 
again.  ( more than likely you wont)...repack only the bearings.  pack them 
tight.  do not use slick fifty.  use a regular high temp wheel bearing grease 
or a better brand of grease.  like synthetic stuff you find at racing pro 
shops.  amsoil, redline, etc.  buy new seals. put it all back together.  in 
1000 miles take apart and repack bearing again.  after 2000 miles take off 
dust cap and re-set bearing end play.  you will NOT have to touch these 
bearings again for 30k or much more!!!  if you can pop the old races out 
successfully without nicking the surface at all, then do it yourself.  i had 
it done by a machine shop once and then only charged my $5 a drum to pop the 
old ones out and the new ones in.   the whole thing should cost less than $40 
tops!!


have fun, do it right once and never have to dink with it again,
zac
