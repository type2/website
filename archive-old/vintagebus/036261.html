Hi Kevin,
That sounds like a normal FW seal drip that seems to happen when the engine 
is just shut down.  If it gets as big or bigger than the length of a dollar 
bill you should replace the FW seal and make sure the area this seal seats 
into is smooth.  If not smooth, sanding lightly with fine grit (400+) will 
remove small amounts of corrosion or nicks in the surface.  So far we have 
only seen one engine that never leaked or used a drop of oil, even during two 
round trips to Corpus Christi Texas from the Seattle Washington area.
