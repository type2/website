You guys all suck! I can't believe it. I post some wheels up for sale and everyone asks for specific dates. Bill Bowman filled me in on where to look for dates and now I look
at every VW wheel I can to find the date code. I even know the difference between crows foot and regular bus wheels. Life was nice and easy until my head was filled with all
of this information.
thanks a lot,
