Subject: Oil Pumps (early and late Question)



Hi,

I pulled the oil pump out of my new engine to replace with the filter
pump from my old engine.

The pump bodies are different, the new engine has longer humps on the
outside.  At first I assumed that
this was a result of an early/late issue, but I noticed that the gear
shafts were identical in length, and it appears
that (haven't measured yet) that the gear shaft portrudes out of the
pump body by the same amount.

Is it possible that the manufacturer makes one pump body (short humps)
for both types and merely makes different gear shaft lengths
for the two types of cams?

Thanks for any info,
...Markus
