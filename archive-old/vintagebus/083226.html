Subject: Re: [VB] Urethane tranee mounts

Ronnie,

Thanks for the information. Guess I won't use the urethane mounts.
 I have been able to measure the vibration, I don't think that it could be

frequency.

&gt;   The biggest cause of vibration I have seen in VW engines as of late is 
&gt; the Brazilian pressure plate. These DO NOT
&gt; alaign properly due to the way they are manufactured and cause a vibration
