Subject: Re: [VB] was Couple new items now window latchs

I used to think the laminated sliding windows were a 61ish through 63 
passenger model thing.   But now I think it was maybe 57ish though 63 
passenger model (including westies but not kombi truck panels etc).    Good 
that the felt are now availble.
