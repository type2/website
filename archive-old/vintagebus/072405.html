Subject: laminate wood interior

well it's darn late &amp; I'm tired, but I wanted to show off the wood
flooring I put in the bus. I found a good deal at Home Depot tonite &amp;
went ahead &amp; bought 2 boxes. it took nearly all of the pieces to fill
the cargo area. Pictures are here:

Needless to say I am very happy. I even got the suicide cabinet
installed.
