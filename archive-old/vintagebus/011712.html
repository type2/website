&gt; Next time you do the static timing on your engine,
&gt; listen closely to your points.  There is a discernible
&gt; electrical click that occurs at the same time that
&gt; the light comes on.  Listen to this sound enough
&gt; times and one doesn't even need a timing light.

Dogonnit!  Now you've gone and given away my secret!  And after I've
worked so hard to convince my friends that I was psychic and could
sense the magnetic field collapsing in the coil...

Yes, this method works.  The sound is not very loud, but is is
distinctive and can easily be used if the background noise level is
low enough.  You have to turn down the Led Zep!
