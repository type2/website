Subject: removing steering lock
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id TAA30381

anyone have any suggestions for remving a steering lock from the steering
column? the key has long since been lost and apears to be in the &quot;locked&quot;
position :P

i have taken the side plate off via the two slotted screws but that hasn't
gotten me a whole lot further
