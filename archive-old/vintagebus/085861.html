Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Recommendation

&gt; I had another thought about the radio and the battery. There are two power
&gt; leads, one is to be attached to a switched power source for main power and
&gt; another to an unswitched source for the memory. I have both leads attached
&gt; to an unswitched source so that I can run the radio with the ignition off.
&gt; Gee if I were to install a toggle switch onto the main lead and shut it off
&gt; when I shut off the ignition.... Einstein, Einstein....


chris
im sure the radio uses more power with both leads hot and it switched off
than in real standby with the switched power off.
same thing happens to me after a week or so without driving.
