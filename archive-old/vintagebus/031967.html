Subject: Quick Canopy for Splitty -WTB
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Want to buy a quick canopy -PDQ - pretty darn quick! Planning on going to 
Busses no where by the arch. Skipping on Eureka - too darn hot! Rebuilt has 
less than 10 miles on it to boot. Why push it!

Who knows where to order a quick canopy for my bus. RMMW - nope. West coast 
metric - nope. Who?

Thanks. Happy trails.
