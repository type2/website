Subject: Engien analysis interpretation.

I'm a little stumped at these numbers, so want to shoot them out for further
opinions.

Engine.
7.1:1 SP 1600.
Engle 100 cam.
Brosol 30/31, jetted as they come.
Stock exhaust, boxes.
Doghouse cooling, all flaps, t stat.

RPM: 857
Dwell: 53.0
Coil 12V
Coil - .003
VOLT 12.5 (new generator breaking in brushes?)
RIpple=0.00
Vac Hg=5.4
HC=3136 PPM (woo, rich?)
CO= 3.10 (rich?)
O2=9.02 (LEAN?)
cO2=6.12
CALCUATED a/f=18.3= lean

Carb has throttle stop screw turned in a bit to hold idle.
Runs pretty well on mains, but feel a miss I can't find every once in a
blue.

Going to check for vac leak at intake again (can't see how the new crush
gaskets couldn't do the job), and recheck jetting, but don't know where to
put it, seems as the engine complains of being both rich and lean at idle.
TIA for any advise,
AL
