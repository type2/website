    Hey Andre,
        No you won't find upper vents under the bondo.
Your bus is a walk-thru panel and they did not come equipped with the rear
upper vents.
(since walk-thrus are open to the cargo area.)
    Also the heating vents in the kick-panels were added by Vw. in April of
64,so many 64's will have
the &quot;tube&quot; set up.
