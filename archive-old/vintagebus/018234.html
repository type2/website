cool!

so, is that what the radio in a 67 bus would have
looked like? I've heard that VW didn't import them
with radios, so maybe not? And the L M and U bands?
Does anyone know if the thing would get FM or AM out
here?

If the radios were put in over here in the US, is
there a chance they're all different? I saw some 67
busses at some shows with radios which looked like the
one in my dad's 72 baywindow. Big and black with knobs
practically the size of Oreos. That's a far cry from
the saphire and such radios of pre-67
