First off: Anybody who likes to camp but hates to drop a load in your
typical campground privvy should head to Mark Twain Lakes. Those toilets
were most excellent, I felt like I could take my Bentley Manual or my Idiot
Book in and spend an hour on one of those thrones. The park staff actually
woke me up Sunday morning at 5:00 am scrubbing away in there. (I was in my
tent, not a stall).
Secondly: My apologies to Isaiah, his buddy, Chris Smith and family and Ben
Hawley for holding up their progress on the way to Missouri thursday
afternoon. Shift coupler broke and I was forced to limp into a Marathon
station parking lot to await my return trip home via a friend's flatbed
trailer. I really appreciated Isaiah's help in vise-gripping my coupler
together to get me off the road, but I didn't want to make a 500 mile round
trip with that on my mind every foot of the way.
The next morning I pulled off the broken coupler, but I couldn't round up a
replacement and I didn't want to miss the event. So on to plan &quot;B&quot;, I take
all the stuff out of the Westy and pile it into my New Beetle. Since It was
Friday, I decided to wait until school let out and bring my daughter
Marcella, the first thing she wanted to know was not &quot;where are we going?&quot;
or &quot;when will we be back?&quot; or even &quot;is Mommy coming?&quot; but &quot;Did you bring my
N'Sync and Brittney Spears CD's?&quot;.
(I did)...So for the next four hours it was &quot;Ooops I Did it Again&quot;...and
various other current hits with the 7 year old crowd.
Not too much to say about the trip to Hannibal, set the A/C on &quot;High&quot;, the
Cruise Control on &quot;75&quot; and wake up four hours later to the nastiest, most
moth-eaten, shakiest, scaryest not to mention tallest and longest bridge
across the Mississippi I had ever seen. I swear, through most of it you
could see the re-bar under the cement, and probably the river under that.
The Missouri Micros have buses in better shape than that bridge is, and
that's saying something. (The MM's by the way consistently have the coolest
&quot;veteran&quot; buses).
It was great to see all my DBG buddies and I &quot;earned&quot; my official club title
of &quot;Inspector 32&quot; by crushing a fold-up lawn chair with my big a$$.
Among the highlights were meeting the guys from Nebraska and seeing Rob
Laffoon's newly purchased single cab, watching NQ work tirelessly throughout
the weekend. Seeing first-hand the outstanding paint on &quot;Frodo&quot;.
It was a tribute to the DBG that the &quot;clean living&quot; theme was taken to heart
by nearly everyone, (who kept leaving their underwear in the shower???)
It was great to visit with Woody in his &quot;Hawaiian Village&quot; site did you guys
sacrifice Wayne at the end of the event? Last time I saw him he was walking
kind of sideways.
Nice to see the Winterkorns there, Butch left something by my tent...Rob,
it's probably time to get a job now.
Congratulations to Pete for his remarkable panel van and to Neil who did the
body and paint, it was good to see Winnifried made it, sorry to hear she had
some problems getting back.
Chris Walsh as usual went way over the top with his &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; single cab
tent arrangement, I expected to see Camels tied up in front of this very
swanky nomad's boudoir.
Ron and Christy Nelson brought enough parts down to make a bus if their
single cab couldn't make the trip home.
The Missouri Micros threw the social event of the season with their post
award &quot;luau&quot; quite the affair complete with straw hats, grass skirts and
gallons of jungle juice. Steve, it was great to meet you, let's race to see
who gets curtains finished first. Bus Boy Billie and Brian Wittling,
Everywhere Ed and Nick with the cool hi-top, it was great to see/meet you
guys too.
It really sucked not having my bus there, and Woody took me aside and
advised me that I was too old to be driving a bus that breaks down, (second
time this year). He's right, and soon I'll do something about it, Lenny
Copp, don't get your hopes up just yet.
I'd like to thank Bill and Kathryn Bowman and everyone who had a hand in
planning and running this fine weekend. Next year, I'll be back in a bus
without an outside thermometer...my NB recorded 104 degrees on Saturday
aftrnoon.
I hope everyone had as much fun as I did and it'll be great to see everyone
next time.
When are they supposed to have that damn bridge fixed anyway?

Thank you Bill and Kathryn, and everyone else who organized and attended
