&gt; I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an
&gt; old transmission, and using that, but it's not real clear to me how
&gt; you do that without having the entire transmission housing hanging out
&gt; there, or doing an awful lot of cutting through thick metal.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions?
&gt;

Actually a bell housing cuts through *very* quickly with a sawzall. (I speak from
experience)

Find an old junk tranny and cut away!!
