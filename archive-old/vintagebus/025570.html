Subject: Just bought a 59 panel
Message-ID: &lt;37711fefJust bought a 59 panel*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I just bought a 59 double door panel that is in great  condition with very 
little rust.  My problem is this...I have
&gt;a big block  Chevy motor sitting in my garage that makes about 400 
horsepower.  Has  anyone put one of these
&gt;into a bus before?  I plan to tub out the rear end  and drag race at my 
local 1/8 and 1/4 mile tracks.
&gt;If anyone could help me with any problems I might run  into and/or tips and 
tricks I could use.
&gt;Thanks, Terry Mercer Oliver Springs, TN

I just finished my lunch and almost had to re-eat it after reading this. You 
might want to trade this out for a less rare bus, rather
than begin cutting and permanently ruining the body. If you are intent on 
switching a V-8 into a bus, and cutting it up doesn't 
turn your stomach, a good switch would be to a 472 Cadillac motor. It would 
have to sit in the cargo area, and you're rear wheels
would definitely extend outboard of the wheelwells. The other thing to think 
about would be checking your link/king pins in the 
front end, and putting many hundred pounds of counter weights over the front 
axle to keep it from becoming airborn when you 
took off at a light.
