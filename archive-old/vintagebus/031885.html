&gt;   I am interested in putting a straight axle kit.
&gt;  
&gt;   What I need to know is, does anyone really know how to actually MAKE the
&gt;   straight axle kit?
&gt;   What spring plates are used, what axle tubes are used, and what axle ends
&gt;   are used, and how is it all put together in the end? I am just curious,
&gt;   because it really looks like a '68 bug rear end, but I figure it couldn't
&gt;  be
&gt;   just that easy.

it is the 68 bug axles (same as type 3 swing axles) .  I believe the spring 
plates are modified splitty spring plates.  

But why dont you call up Wolfgang in Redding.  They do all that lowered stuff 
and could tell you.

they you too can have clearance problems changing oil and advusting valves
