Subject: Re: [VB] Short Turning Radius on 64 SC

huh, ok maybe I have it wrong, I have a long turning radius, no I would say
I have a short turning radius, if I don't start turning well before the
street I have to back up in the street and go at it again, THAT'S NOT A GOOD
THING!

Thanks for the support though!
