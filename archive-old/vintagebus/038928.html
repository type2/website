Subject: RE: [VB] Straight Axle Kit Question (Vintage Nazi's need not respond)

Aaron,
	The axles required are long spline long axle, they were used on 68 bugs and
I believe maybe 67-69 TIIIs, but I am not one to say. I do know long spline
long axle are not the 'usual' bug axles. 67 shouldn't work, and aren't 69
bugs IRS, which wouldn't work unless you are using an IRS kit.
I must say, I wouldn't dare drop a 23, especially a very original one, but
it is up to you. IMine just came that way, but was done so crappily it was
just as easy (just more pricey) to go back to stock, than undo all the
screwups.
One thing I didn't like was the camber attitude of the rear wheels, it seems
like you have to really slam it even ,ower than the 3.5 inches to get the
axles straight enough for near zero camber, or carry around a couple hundred
more pounds all the time. With a 1641, I could go 65+, don't know the rpms.
It handled like shit only because the PO set up nearly everything wrong, so
I cannot be a good judge of how great over stock config it might be.
If you want to lower the front, do so with spindles or beam adjusters, not
torsion bar/leaf reindexing.
You will also have to change you rear brakes, and either get overly
expensive wheel adapters, make your own, or get fancy rims for clearance.
I bet the lowered buses with big motors 1776+ enjoy better mileage, higher
speed, some more stability, and give up the camper and utility qualities
(load capacity) of stock buses, so it's all about what you use yours for...
Wishing I could use mine....Knee deep in this thing now...
Al
66 DLX no engine, trans, spindles, gas tank, wheels, interior....

Was 68 a one only year, a conversion year from 67 to newer style or is
that just
what everybody is using.  Why won't a 69 of a 67 work?  sorry for the
ingnorant
question, I just haven't done this yet and am interested in dropping my
23.

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt; The spring plates are special hacks, if you are a compotent welder you
could
&gt; probably do it. The axles tubes are slightly? shortened 68 long spliners,
&gt; and the axles are just that TIII/T1 1968er, long spline/long alxes. Axle
&gt; ends appear to be stock, but the brakes are useally tIII installed
swapped,
&gt; so ebrake and cyl are in TII attitude.
&gt;
&gt; You cannot use the stock 68 tubes and plates, your wheels will hit stuff,
I
&gt; am told.
&gt; This is based on the wolfgang kit I just removed.
