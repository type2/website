&gt; Aloha,
&gt;    I've recently been trying to fix up a 67 kombi that I just became the
&gt; proud owner of.  However, I am a little new to VWs(and this list), and
&gt; was wondering if someone could help me out with a tran/engine
&gt; question..........Am I asking for trouble by leaving my transmission
&gt; with the reduction gears?  Are the gears able to be removed and still
&gt; use the existing swing axle transmission or does/can the newer kind IRS
&gt; have to be put in its place?  I plan on putting in a 1641 or 1776 engine
&gt; as I am constantly driving across the island to surf and enjoy hitting
&gt; 60+ in order to maximize my before work surf time (uphill Kam hwy when
&gt; you're late for work is a bitch).  Any replies and experience would be
&gt; greatly appreciated.  
&gt;   Oh yeah, what exactly makes a Frwy Flyer Fly?  It sounds just like
&gt; what I need.   
&gt;   Thanks,    JD
well,

JD... you already have the perfect transmission for a splitty IMHO...

the 67 transmission has a 4.12 ring and pinion as compared to the 4.3?
ring and pinion of 64-66.  What this means is that your safe top speed
with stock tire size is around 66 MPH.  Make sure your tires are close to
the right size and you are all set, IMHO...

Changing out the transmission for IRS is either very expensive and fraught
with complexity, or inexpensive, fraught with complexity and wont work
right for squat.  Generally the cheaper option requires you lower the bus.
Once the bus is lower you need to run low profile tires... then you loose
the high speed gearing advantage you just spent so much money to get...
kind of a catch 22.

A freeway flier has a 3.88 ring and pinion WITH redux boxes. You will
be able to go even faster, but around town performance might suffer.  Its
not a bad option with a big engine, but since you have a 67 tranny i'd
stay the way it is.

This subject has been beaten to death in the past... try going to
www.type2_dot_com and searching the archives, you will have several hours
worth of reading material to peruse...

peas,

Steve
