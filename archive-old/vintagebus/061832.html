Hi all 
I'm continue to read all of your great sites And I've see that the bus
I'm dreaming is a 21 window (before 1967 if I've well understood) I've
just a question I've seen on several gallery that this type of bus have
the 2 front windows that is oppening Is it a tunning operation ? or is
it original ? 

thanks for your answer and accept all my appologies for this stupid
question. 

Olivier
