&lt;&lt; Scored a mint decklid at Phx.bug-rama today,but no one i`ve talked to
seems
 to know what it belongs on.
 Looks identical to a 58` decklid,but has pushbutton instead of
churchkey??????
 Any clues???
  &gt;&gt;
sounds like either a rigged up 58, or most likely the newer Brazilian
replacement decklid. uses 67 latch i think.
