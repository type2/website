I read the proposed bill modifications in question and this guy has
seriously misrepresented the content. It only applies to previosly totaled
vehicles and antique and special interest vehicles are exept. other
vehicles pre-81 that have been previously totaled would be required to
pass an emissions standard before being re-registered.

&gt; OK folks, this is technically against list rules since it contains no
&gt; specific type 2 content, but it is an issue that will hit type 2 owners if
&gt; it isn't stopped dead in its tracks.  I decided to go ahead and forward
&gt; it.

&gt; 
&gt; It has come to my attention that the Oregon State Legislature has it's
&gt; sights on vintage cars.  According to an article that I got from a parts
&gt; house, Oregon state rep. Richard Devlin has introduced a bill that would
&gt; prohibit the registration of ALL MOTOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED BEFORE 1981
&gt; beginning Jan. 1, 2010.  The bill would allow the registration of antique
&gt; or special interest vehicles that HAVE PASSED UNSPECIFIED EMISSIONS
&gt; STANDARDS.
&gt; 
&gt;  If you want to register your opposition to this bill (HB 3217) you can
&gt; call the Oregon Legislative Assembly's information line at (503) 986-1187.
&gt; Or the sponsor Rep. Devlin _at_ &lt;devlin.rep_at_state.or_dot_us&gt;
&gt;  or other reps found _at_
&gt; &lt;&lt;http://www.leg.state.or_dot_us/house.html.&gt;www.leg.state.or_dot_us/house.html.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;  Thank you for your time.
