Subject: Trailer hitch (68-71) and paraffin trick
Message-ID: &lt;6b669388.244fe248_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Being unable to find a proper hitch for my bus, I came about the idea to use
rear bumper mounts, weld a bar between the two, and weld a ball in the
middle. If I do it while the mounts are on the bus, ought to have the
alignment correct, and be able to pull off the bumper, and install the hitch
on the 69 or 71 as needed. Any thoughts on this??

I have a 69 parter on the farm that I bought for the bumpers that turned out
to be straight but toast, but the brackets were good. Before I realized that
the bumpers were that bad I tried and tried to get the bolts out with
penetrating oil, heat and brute force to no avail. Would not budge. Left them
there half hooked to the bus for months. Tonight I remembered a hint from the
type 2 list about using paraffin and worked so easy it was amazing. Heated
those suckers up and applied wax till it stopped melting. ALL frozen nuts
came off with no effort at all. Amazing! I used bowl wax that is made to seal
your toilet to the plumbing in the floor. Available at any hardware store for
about $1.00. Highly recommended. Warning - is flammable (like a candle) and
messy to clean up.
