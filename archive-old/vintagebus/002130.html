 Hi Robert, 
I too decided not to take a chance on the braking down.I have an oil leak 
at the pulley that put an end to my plans. With the Buskatiers, Rob, Erin, 
Justin and Rick, passing through on Wednesday, then JP, Barry and Kerry
here to caravan with the rest of the Havasu locals, it was very difficult to
make the decision not to go.  My wife said we could take her R*nger but
it just wouldn't be the same.
  Robert the high point of OCTO for me would have been to see your Westy
and meet you.  You would have wondered why your bus was 'clicking' as I
took a few hundred 'pics' of your bus for references on mine!
  Now we can relax and enjoy making our Westys better!  I'll see you down the &quot;Road&quot;!
  Lou in Havasu
