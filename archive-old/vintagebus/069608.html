Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] tranny oil: Rancho sez....

Odd, I've been running synthetic trans oil for the last 7 years, not
problems in any of the transaxles because of it. Old stock trannies, new
stock trannies, and built trannies for drag racing. Never a problem with any
of them. Everyone I know that's run synthetic in thier trannies has not had
any problems either, and that's a lot of people on all the various forums.

Go figure.....

&gt; The style of synchros used in early VW and 911 (901 &amp; 915)
&gt; transmissions do not work well with synthetic - it's *too* slippery.
