Subject: Re: [VB] 67 bus running out of gas

Yep, I got screwed because of that once.  I was on a 450 mile trip.  Luckily
though, it clogged about 2 miles from my house on the way back.  So the tow
bill was pretty cheap.  I put a new one back in.  I figure that if it took
36 years for the first one to clog, I'll be fine for the next 36 years.

&gt; Personally I remove the fuel sock in the tank.  If it gets clogged you are
&gt; pretty screwed on the side of the road.
