I just went outside and put my 10' inside the bus and shut the hatch it fits
great.
I agree with Thom about leaving boards on cars it a great way to wreak a surf
trip.
I always though one of the cool reasons to own a Bus was that you could shove
your board inside and go surf.

Ps i go to Hawaii once a year to surf where about's are ya
