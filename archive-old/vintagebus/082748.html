Thanks yet again Andy

Today I finally made it down to see Enrique who runs The Wizards in South 
Miami &amp; I just wanted to say you were right about him.  He's a VW mechanic in the 
true John Muir tradition -- very much a 60's oriented guy in that he is 
willing to do what he can to help people even while running a business that needs 
to make a profit.  He let me go through his stash of 20 or so old cams &amp; I 
found a -3, but it still was too tight a fit when it was laid into its bore in the 
case &amp; mated w/ the crank gear.  At that point I'd already single-handedly 
kept him 45 minutes past his closing time so he wants me to bring the crank &amp; cas
e back tomorrow to try it out w/ one of his old crank gears.  But now I'm 
thinking that if he has a rebuilt -MAGNESIUM- case for a price I can afford I 
should just bite the bullet &amp; spend the money here instead of trying to save the 
price of the case &amp; risking another meltdown on the way north.
