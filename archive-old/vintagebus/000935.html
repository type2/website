My '67 has one - part #113 827 503F. RMM has one for about $17.00 - I'm sure
you could find 'em at just about any VW parts supplier.

Someone opening the lid just &quot;to see what I got&quot; isn't so bad. I once had
someone open the lid of my '64 bug and take all the plug wires, leaving me
stranded!

&gt; Bus content:  Did any busses come with a locking decklid latch
&gt; that I could
&gt; use for my 67?  Now that I'm driving my bus a lot more and
&gt; parking it in public
&gt; places I don't like the idea of anyone walking up to it and being
&gt; able to just
&gt; open engine lid &quot;to see what I got&quot;.
