Subject: Re: [VB] Re:RGBox bolts [VB] There REALLY IS a point here, I 
  promise.

Correction to my own post.  The broken bolt is on the drivers side.

Anyone agree with my mechanic that the broken and loose bolts would cause
the CLUNKING noise that I have been looking for for months now ?  Or do I
believe TMFH that the noise comes from the &quot;flower&quot; in the axel ?  Diane
