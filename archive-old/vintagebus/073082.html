Subject: Buses On The River, 2003

Ya'll come back, now!  Ya heer?

It's that time of year, again...  By now, you've already
got the bus packed, you've triple checked the inventory,
and all the yard apes have gone to the bathroom if they
needed to, or not.  Now all you've got to do is sit and
wait to slip slide down the river.

Buses On The River is THIS WEEKEND.  That's right, the
event you've all heard of, many have been too, and quite a
few have gotten their britches wet for is Aug. 15-17!  

The Nolichucky River is waaayyyy up.  Be Cautious!!  The
level is currently dropping as we speak and hopefully it
will be manageable for adults AND children to float on in
tubes.  But, if levels rise again, we are NOT recommending
anyone ride it in a tube.  Though, Kayakers will enjoy it
immensely!  

Remember that we will be serving Breakfast Burritos but no
other common meals, so prepare for yourselves and you CAN
buy food locally.

http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com/busriver/busriver.html  is
the website, with directions.  The campground has nice,
complete facilities so it's an easy run for the whole lot
to come to.  We won't MAKE you bathe unless you smell
REALLY terrible, however.  After all, we don't want to
displace our TN Hippy persona thing we've so desperately
been striving for.

Your ramblin river rat,
Travis Adams
