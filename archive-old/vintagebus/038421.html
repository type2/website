Hi Jason,

As I went through his whole topic a few weeks ago, I can give you an answer
:)

IMO, and in the opinion of others -- your best investment is the &quot;type1
automatic starter&quot;.  From what I understand, this starter was never used in
the type2 -- but it is a great replacement.  It is &quot;self supporting&quot; and
does not need a bushing in the case.  It also seems to have a bigger motor
and I find it cranks harder.

Telephone your local parts store and tell get a price for a &quot;starter for a
1973 automatic (auto-stick) bug&quot;.  If I remember correctly, I paid $47 and
$12 core for a rebuilt one (Exide).  This was at a flaps that offers a
lifetime replacement on the part as long as I use it only on the one
vehicle.

Anyway, if you want to go 12v on an old bus -- my recommendation.

If you want to see photos of starters, go to http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/
&lt;-- I took photos of my starters when I was trying to figure out 6v vs. 12v
vs. automatic.

Also check the archives at http://vw.i405_dot_com/ == you will find all you want
to know about starters.  Start with searches like &quot;starter near bushing&quot; and
other variations like &quot;starter near auto*&quot;.

Need some help.  I just bought a 65 split window and the person that had it
before but a 1600cc engine in it.  The engine runs cherry but the starter is
blown.  He said he has been through 3 starters.  I need to know what kind of
starter to get.....also I heard that since the bus is 12 volt that I need to
get a converter or something ?  Need some help....I'm totally lost.....  Thx
fellas.....by tha way....this is my first VW
