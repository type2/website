&gt; so now we can reveal what part can be removed from a 1950 Barndoor Deluxe
&gt; walk-through and installed on a 1998 Corvette...... Valve Stems... otherwise
&gt; known as Schrader valves. Strangely enough, they can be installed on a 1965

Aha!

You know when I read that first part of the post where this answer was
guessed, I was incredulous! Valve stems are different in every make and
model! The stems on the valves of a fuel injected bug are different than
a carbureted 1600 DP! The stems on rabbit valves are made to take seals.

Oh, wait, you guys are talking about the valves on the tires...not in
the engine. 

Nevermind. :)
