&gt;It is a vestige of the days when I didn't WANT us to get a lot of 
&gt;hits from people who weren't list members because we didn't have
&gt;the resources to serve them all, so I deliberately left out meta
&gt;tags and such--we have the resources now so I will fix that.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I'll take out the scripts that deliberately sabotage web
&gt;spiders too.  =^ )

Meta tags yes, spiders...I dunno.  I'd say to let them in to the
first level or two, like the main pages and one level down.  If
you let the spiders into the Library and Archive pages, everyone
who has a valid email address on their contribution will get
more spam.  Search engine people aren't the only ones running
spiders...

One of the (non-VW) lists I have previously subscribed to was
archived at listquest_dot_com, which had an interesting approach to
this problem.  When you searched through messages, all the email
addresses were displayed as small B&amp;W GIFs instead of text.  Still
hackable, but it raises the bar a little (rule #1: spammers are
stupid).

Another thing that will probably happen if the sites are more
well-known is that you and Thom will get lots more direct email
asking VW questions.  (Maybe you get a lot now - I don't know).
I would say to just forward them to the list, but you may have
other ideas.  :)

I know the VW rags sometimes run articles on VW-related web sites.
Maybe a small classified ad with just the URLs would be a good
way to reach more people...?
