Subject: re:westy interior

It looks like I might not have much luck finding the rest of the westy
interior here in texas. Does anyone have any leads on where I could get
dimensions of the cabinets and front-rear facing seat for a non-walk
through and/or some detailed pictures of what the interior looks like.
Also any pictures that show how the seat and cabinets mount in the bus
would be great. Thanks , I think this much would really be helpfull for
our camping trips up to california this christmas and maybe to west
virginia this summer, and then have time to hit more swap meets for the
remaining articles. The kids ripped a hole in the z-bed seat the other
day, and I have been looking for an excuse to recover it anyways. Thanks
