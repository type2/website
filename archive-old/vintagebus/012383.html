Thanks Eric and Barb for the relpy. I will check the glass to see if 
there is a name on it. If so, what does that mean ? 
 
On the tag asked about, I figured out that 21 meant the panel van. What 
does the D next to it mean. 21 D
 
I fount out what the numbers 425 and 043 mean, but noone seems to know 
what  the 002 is for. 
 
On the third line, the UN mean where it was shipped too.  I dont know 
what the stuff after that means.   
 
UN 2112 383883 6078245
 
Also, I assume the sticker below the tag that says SAMTGRUN L 512 means 
it was painted some kinda green from the factory. 
 
One more question....is there anywhere on the bus besides the tag that 
is on the fresh air thing above the drivers seat where I can find the 
VIN number. I thought there was supposed to be a tag in the engine 
compartment to the right of the engine and below where the gas tank is. 
Atleast thats where it is on my 62 Kombi.  There are no holes that  
would mean one was even there. 
 
Thanks,
David

&gt;Hi David,
&gt;&lt;&lt; The van also has a cab divider that looks to be in very good shape. 
It does
&gt;have a pading over it, so I am wondering if that is the way its 
supposed to be
&gt;or did someone do this.&gt;&gt;
&gt;Since there was never a padded version that we know of we would have to 
say
&gt;the padding is not factory.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt; The glass window is there too. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Does the window have the Serkerit brand name on it?
&gt;Eric &amp; Barb
