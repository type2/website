Subject: How about the bumpers, painting them that is..
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, keeping with the fact that I am holding on to my original paint, I was 
curious about the bumpers themselves. They have quite a bit of corrosion on 
them (although not too terribly bad) and I was wanting to paint them.  Should 
I not?&gt; If I do, what is the correct color and how should I go about doing 
it? Thanks for the help and opinions, they have been a great assistance to 
me!! :)

    Take care,
