Can someone help Ben and I out on this one.  I can't remember all the
particulars but Dr. Joe Nodzak or something like that in Phoenix is the bus
towbar maker.  Ben - you cannot use a bug towbar on a bus.  It bottoms out
on the bumper and isn't near long enough.  The Dr. Joe towbar is about $125
shipped last I knew.   As it comes, the towbar is only suitable for towing
around town.  If you are going to take it out on the highway, weld some
triangular plates of reinforcement from the vertical angle iron axle tube
guides down to the towbar.  You'll see what I mean when it arrives.  It's a
damn good towbar otherwise.
