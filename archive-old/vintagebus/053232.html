Subject: Re: RE: [VB] N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value

Trust me - the value the insurance company puts on the bus, and
the value the DMV puts on the bus are as closely related as peanut
butter and plutonium...

DMV's job is to extract as much money out of you as they can

The Insurance company's job is to pay you as little as they can,
while extracting as much as they can.  That's why 'agreed value'
policies are a joke - they agree on that value when they calculate
your premium, but they won't agree on it when it's time to make a 
claim.

They joy in DMV thinking your bus is worth more is similar to the joy
of the county thinking your house is worth more when they re-assess your
taxes...

&gt; &gt;I dont know about you, but I wish all my buses were worth about $100 each...even
&gt; though I have waaaay more than that in 'em.  It would be so great if they
&gt; were worthless.
