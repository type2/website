As with any VW toy, be it Hot Wheel, Matchbox or Road and Track, it's very
difficult to get hold of.  The HW and Matchbox collectors snatch them box
they are worth more than the others.  I'm a collector of VW related stuff
and that's all.  When I arrived at Wal-Mart before it opened, there was
already several Hot Wheels collectors there.  When the doors opened the
manager greeted them by name.  These people are hardcore collectors.  These
people are the ones making it SO hard to get the VW stuff I want.  So yes I
have befriended a person at Wal-Mart to try to get what is rightfully mine.

&lt;&lt; I disagree.  I just got it today through &quot;contacts&quot; at my local Wal Mart
and
 this thing rocks.  &gt;&gt;

Who are you? Eddie Van Halen? Is this toy that big a deal that you have to
know someone to get one?
