&gt; I heard there was one in Oregon, wasn't it for sale for a couple hundred
&gt; bucks?

Whatever happened to the guy who claimed to have pulled a 54 Binz out of
Utah and then wouldn't let anyone photograph it or wouldn't take any photos
because a lot of people said he was wrong, were skeptical, etc?  Last I knew
he chose to just go into hiding over it or something like that.  A 54 Binz
is such a rare beast, I'd sure like to see some photos of it.  If anything,
Dan Kinsey should be allowed to know about it as he is compiling a list of
Binz's known to exist.  His list isn't very big but he's flown all over the
US in search of them.
