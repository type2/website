I don't know if any existing liens would be a problem if 
you're taking it to Canda, eh?  But th eprocedure is quite
simple to check the title in CA.  Call up the nearest Ca DMV,
wait on hold for ~25 minutes, explain the the nice, dumb lady that 
you're trying to check to see if the title on the car you're wishing to buy
is clear (don't confuse here by telling her you're from Canada, eh?)
and if there are any outstanding (or mediocre) liens, parking
tickets, etc.
She'll ask you for the VIN, look it up, put you on hold, transfer you
to her &quot;superior&quot;, etc, etc.  Lather rinse repeat.  Eventually
you should get a yay or nay answer, eh?

Actually, the last time I did this, it was quite painless, and
took about 10 minutes or so, eh?
