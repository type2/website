&lt;&lt; It looks like these have a bend in them so they will cause tension between 
the bolt and the pin/latch.  What is the purpose of this? &gt;&gt;

Hi Wes,
Those are to keep the rods from rattling in the doors from driving vibration. 
 Just like the springs against the delux chromy collars of the cargo door 
handles.  If you are deaf it will not affect you, but really drive any 
hearing passengers nuts.   Eric&amp;Barb
