Hello all.
In my searches for a RHD split crew cab that is NOT a project, I came across 
an obscure ad in a british VW mag and contacted the guy.  Here is the 
information he sent me, note the vehicles are in britain somewhere.  Please 
contact him, not me, and he will email you photos of the vehicles.  In my 
opinion of the photos, the crewcab is complete but a project, the two vans 
look pretty solid and complete drivers.

If anyone knows of a non-project, RHD split crew cab that is for sale, 
please pass me on the information.
Thanks,
Rich
