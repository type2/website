&lt;&lt; I've got a volt/ohm meter. So do you mean check the voltage between each 
connection and the ground?&gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
That will work fine.  Good to hear your VW is now working.  Still a good idea 
to go through everything to check for voltage droppage.  We recently did this 
to our 1963 SC and made a huge differance in head light and signal/taillights 
brightness and the signal got way brighter and faster to be seen better by!

&lt;&lt; Is this with the key on or off? &gt;&gt;
Mostly off.  When you test areas where they are controled by the ignition 
switch (Signals, brake lights, E-lights..) you will need the key on.  If you 
are going to test for more than a minute or two it is a good idea to pull the 
power wire off of the coil to prevent burning the points in the distributor.
