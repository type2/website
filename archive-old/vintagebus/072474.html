Subject: Help TheSamba win a Webby Award!

I became aware of the Webby Awards through an online radio station that I have
fallen in love with. (Http://www.KEXP_dot_org)

It occurred to me that my favorite &quot;German car&quot; site ought to be nominated and
the we ought to orchestrate a write-in campaign as a thank-you pay back to
Everett Barnes for all of the service that he has provided to the &quot;German car&quot;
community. Please pass the word.

I propose that we all vote within the following url:
http://www.webbyawards_dot_com/peoplesvoice/register.html

Please vote under the &quot;Community&quot; category. The Samba is not a commerce site,
it is provided as a service to our community. Other sites like eBay_dot_com,
Amazon_dot_com
would be obvious butt-kickers if it were (commercial).

I have already voted using the following URL:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw

In order to give consistent credit, we need to use the same one. Vote between
now and June 5, 2003. Spread the word and see if we can make Mr. Barnes a Webby
winner!
-Jim Ellis
