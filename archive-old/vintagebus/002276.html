Subject: URGENT- need help removing cargo doors '67

HELP! I have 3 days to get the cargo doors off of my '67 and I am at a loss
on how to do it. I removed the little plastic cap/screw and I can not figure
out what is holding the pin inside the hinge. Someone told me there is a
screw but I do not anything but allot of crud. I tried digging the crud out,
but I still do not see a screw down in there. Do I need a special tool?
Suggestions, comments, advice?
