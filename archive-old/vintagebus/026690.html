Subject: German heater

        Hi Y'all,
                One of the members of the club I'm in ,is a semi truck
mechanic, and he has been telling me of this modern German diesel
heater( which is easily converted to gasoline).Truck drivers use these
heaters to heat there sleeping compartments,instead of running there
engines all night long. He has one installed in his bubble window bus .I
have been very impressed with how small . quiet, and efficient this darn
thing is! So the other day I visited a bone yard with tons of semi
tractors there.Well one of them had one of these Webasto heaters!! They
are about 4&quot; round and about 12&quot; long, they look like a Eperspacher
(sp?) shunk down to 1/4 size.New ones run over $1200, which is way out
of my budget! Well I scored one for $100.Thermostat,wiring
harness,computer box,fuel pump,exhaust pipe,cradle, extra glow plug, and
heater itself, all included.The one ploblem is I have to drill about 15
holes in my bus to mount everything.Well it's a huge benefit
to me and my passengers so I'm breaking the drill out!
    The reason I haven't wanted to use an Eperspacher is because of how
ineffecient they are.(electrically and gas wise)
    No more freezing my arse in the sub-zero temps..
If anybody wants more info p-mail me and I will try to help.

                    woody
