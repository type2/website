&lt;&lt; during my quest to find a way to get my 1776 motor to run a little
 cooler in the 111+ heat of phoenix--with a 3.88 rancho tranny--the heat
 is mainly do to high rpms as i have been told.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jerry, 
It would help to know what dia. are your tires and what year is this bus?  If
you are running a 25&quot; dia tire on both front and back you should get a speed
of 56MPH at 3,000 with the 3.875 R&amp;P or 58MPH if you install 1964-67
suspension.  If you increase the size of the rear tires more you increase the
top speed, but keep the same RPMs.  For stock 4.125 R&amp;P here are the results
one attains when increasing the rear tires over 25&quot;, but keeping the fronts at
25&quot;dia..  For the 3.875 R&amp;P double these increases in speed.  
1. 26.5&quot; dia = 2MPH more.
2. 27&quot; dia.= 3MPH more.  Unfortunitly at this time one can not use this size
radial in pre-1963 stock bus rear wheel wells.
3. 29&quot; dia.= 6.4MPH more.

PS What Todd says about trying to manufacture new reduction gear boxes is
exactly what we found out ourselfs.  Instead if you have a pre-1963 bus with
stock wheel wells you might want to look into a special made .79 fourth gear
from one of the tranny shops in S. Cal., but expect to spend about $200.00+
for just this one gear.  Otherwise you can get the right sized rear tires, the
3.875 R&amp;P, 1964-67 suspension and be able to do about 63MPH at 3,000RPM in a
pre-1963 bus.   EEE&amp;B
