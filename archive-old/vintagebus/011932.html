It looks like several others agree to these thoughts. Apologies if too
redundant. Bottom line is that I encourage you to listen to the advice of
the others, do serious soul searching as to the intented purpose for the
redo/resto. Are you going to put in a museum or travel the world with it.
Make it nice but don't turn it into a jeweled Fabrage' Egg. Use the sucka! =)

1.&gt;
Shop around until you find a body and paint professional with whom you are
comfortable.

2.&gt;
Obtain references from persons in the vintage auto community. Do not limit
yourself to only VWs. Also ask for references from your perspective
body/paint pro.

3.&gt;
Try to locate a body/paint pro who is familiar with and experienced in
restoring the VW marque.

4.&gt;
Do business before you do business.
Write/document what you wish to be accomplished. Come to an understanding
and agreement to these items and the scope of the work in advance of
starting the work. This is fair to both you and the paint pro. Details
count. This  actually should be item number 1.&gt; You could present the list
to the various bidders to use as a baseline for comparisions of the bids.
This is also fair to the body/paint pro as it limits the scope of the project.

5.&gt;
Expect surprises in both schedule, scope of the work, and budget.
Give the shop time to do the work. Agree, if possible on a schedule of
timeline &quot;milestones&quot; at which time you and the pro will meet and confer on
the progress.

6.&gt; Use quality products. Give consideration to Das Bulli Haus as a source
of quality fit replacement panels. The possible difference in cost will be
recouped in shop labor time. Good body and paint products increase the
probability of a quality end product. Body shop craftsmanship is the
foundation of a quality job. Spraying top quality products on horse manure
will will not hide the farm.

7.&gt;
Becareful not to over restore the vehicle! I know some folks, ;-) wink-wink,
who came kinda close to doing this. Make the bus nice but remember to enjoy
it and use it when it's back together. Remember to have fun.

Good luck!
