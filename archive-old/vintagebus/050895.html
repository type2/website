Subject: 21/23 Split manual question

Hi,

A question for the NOS mavens...

There is a guy on ^Bay that is selling a 63 23 Window manual. I was 
asked by someone if this was the last year (i think it was) for a 
sunroof specific manual. Or if you bought a 21 split in 64-67 did you 
get a unique manual? If so, was it in addition to the standard 
transporter manual - or was it the only manual you got.

Thanks,
Conrad
