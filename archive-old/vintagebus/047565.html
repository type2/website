Subject: Help! Brakes Sticking.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My rear right brakes on my 1970 have been jamming.  I know its a bay window 
bus but the brakes seem to have more in common with the 60s models rather 
than the later models and you guys are much more helpful.  

The flat bar that goes between the brake pads is coming out of its slot and 
jamming the pads open.  I already know that I need to replace the turning 
stars on this wheel and would like to assume that this is happening because 
the brakes are adjusted improperly.  Does this make sense?  Has anyone dealt 
with this problem before?  The stars are on order and I will attempt to 
adjust the brakes properly, but hope someone can tell me what more needs to 
be done to keep this from occurring.  Any tips or helpful hints would be 
greatly appreciated as I would prefer not to change brake pads every month!

Thanks
