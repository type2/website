&gt; People - including VW - have ALWAYS thought nothing of running 80 over
&gt; cases. That's why they made the bearings. Think that's bad? I have a set
of
&gt; 100/20/100s!  VW made bearings that size because they felt that it SHOULD
&gt; work... mebbee not too well, but it should work.

I know GEX makes those bearings, but I thought VW recommended against even
using 60's, much less 80's. Maybe VW Brasil is making them, but I never
heard of such from Volkswagenwerk AG. I think it should probably work too,
but I wouldn't choose to use them. Or I could be completely full of $][it.
Merry Xmas to all, by the way.
