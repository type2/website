You know the best thing to encourage you to oil/grease the axles of 
your floor jack is to carry it in the back of your bus and spend 2 
hours trying to work out what the new squeak is when you go around 
corners.

I thought I had it secured so it wouldn't move, but it did, and the 
squeak was a puzzle 'til I worked it out.

Also on a similar thread, I actually find that sometimes I turn down 
the radio just to listen to the engine. I actually find that 
listening to the engine on a long trip is sometimes better than 
listening to inane music on commercial radio stations, and it sure 
beats advertisements.
