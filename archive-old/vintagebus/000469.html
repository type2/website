Subject: [VB] '58 Vent wing latches needed
Message-ID: &lt;0.926c1926.2552f232_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

As the weather gets colder the need for vent wing latches on my Binz gets 
greater.  Noticed it was quite a chilly ride in this morning!!  Would love to 
have NOS but anything in good shape will do.  Not sure which years would be 
correct.  Need both left and right.  Any help appreciated!
 
 Thanks,
