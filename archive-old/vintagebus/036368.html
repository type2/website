&lt;&lt;&lt;  all my buses start with -out a hitch no relays etc.
only the single cab gave me trouble, a new!!!! starter
clean wires and an 01 gauge battery cable solved my problem 
there, over 110 degrees daily,always drive at least 1 of my buses and
when
i get the urge i'll swap and drive another all in the same day
next week i plan on driving all 4 of my runners (need to move stuff
around to make room for another runner) i keep all my drivers at home
and the soon to be's at the shop, but even after setting a few pumps and
a couple cranks and off they go

proper tuning, clean cables, good wireing etc. and there should be no
need
for a relay ( properly called hard start switch) fix it right bandaids
only cover the real problem

only my experience

just something to do

ps. the only time 1 of my buses is hard to start is
when i park in vwhowards driveway, his bus must steal all my buses
karma. 




In addition to what Clara suggested also remember to unhook the battery
&gt; prior to disassembling and cleaning the starter connections. When
crossing
&gt; the terminals between the big red wire (comes from the ignition
switch) and
&gt; the 13mm nut wires (hot- to battery) remember to reconnect the
battery,
&gt; have the vehicle in neutral and secured with wheel chocks and/or
ebrake.
&gt; You are going to be under the bus, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Some one else had a problem with their bus not starting after a long
hot
&gt; drive...
&gt; 
&gt; It is typical around my local area &lt;Phoenix,AZ&gt; to install an old
school GM
&gt; or FORD starter relay in the starter circuit and mounted in the
vacinity of
&gt; the starter to minimize the length of the hot wire. Resistance builds
up in
&gt; the long wires running the full length of the bus up to the ignition
switch
&gt; and back to the starter. I'm not anymore than a very scarey novice
when it
&gt; comes to 'lectricity so check the Hoover comments or basic Electical
theory
&gt; references. All I know is that an appropriate starter relay can help.
&gt; Likewise check other sources for the proper install of one of these
relays.
&gt; I've learned the hard way to make sure that the battery is
disconnected
&gt; prior to messing with hot connections in an remove and inspect task.
&gt; (Bzzzzt, smoke!!!!!) ;--0 
&gt; Have one of the starter relay setups on the '67 RFH and need to put a
6volt
&gt; one on the '54 barndoor. It was the routine during the OCTO/Classic
weekend
&gt; to see me roll under the bus and jump it via the &quot;crossing&quot; method
&gt; everytime we stopped. The replacement starter button that I found at
the
&gt; OCTO didn't completely fix my troubles. Golden hearted Richard K
&lt;Rustybus&gt;
&gt; and Everette Barnes helped push several times.
&gt; 
&gt; Start with Clara's good suggestions.
