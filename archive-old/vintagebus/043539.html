&gt;&gt; I have a 65 bus with a Saphire I radio. The radio
&gt;&gt; works great and gets great reception until I turn on
&gt;&gt; the wipers.  Then I start getting static. Nothing
&gt;&gt; terrible.  I can still hear the radio, its just
&gt;&gt; annoying (the static that is).
&gt;
&gt;Mine does it too.  You might try routing the RF to ground via a .01
&gt;microfarad disc capacitor (cheap, at Radio Shack) connected between the
&gt;power terminal on the wiper motor and ground.  Keep the leads short.

If the '65 has the one-speed motor like my '64, the power and
ground terminals are right next to one another on the motor - you
might pull off the wires and solder the capacitor to the terminals
down past where the wires connect.  

While the wires are off, shine up the terminals with a small wire 
brush, fine sandpaper, etc.  Also unscrew the ground wire at the
other end and shine it up where it mounts to the body.

Does your Sapphire have a ground wire too, or just a power wire?
If it doesn't have a ground wire, you might add one.  Crimp a
forked connector onto a length of wire, loosen a screw that goes
directly into the metal case of the radio, slip the connector
under the screw, and tighten.  Run the other end of the wire to
the body for a ground - one of the parcel shelf bolts might be
handy.  *Don't* ground it to the same screw as the windshield
wiper motor!

Make sure your antenna is well-bolted to the body, and that the
antenna cable isn't broken.  If it uses the standard &quot;Motorola&quot;
car-antenna radio connector, the connector will probably have
little tabs or wings on its outside for the antenna ground 
connection - *gently* bending these out a little and plugging
the connector back in may get you a better connection.

Have you adjusted the antenna trimmer?  Bentley shows how to
do it for the German radios but most older radios adjusted the
same way.  Basically you find the adjustment, tune in a weak
AM station, and adjust it (small screwdriver) for the best
signal.  The adjustment place is usually a small hole in the
radio case, maybe behind a little cover, that is marked
&quot;ANT&quot; or &quot;TRIM&quot; or with an antenna symbol, basically a
triangle with an extra line in the middle.  This probably won't
have a real big effect on the static, but it ensures the best
match between your radio and your antenna for best reception.

Good luck!
