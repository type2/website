Listees,

In the near future, I've got to address the frame components of my beautiful
21 Window Deluxe (I will be registering with Thom's registry this week).  I
especially need to refab the rear passenger area just up from the axle tubes..
Best way to do this it to have the body of the frame.  How difficult is this
to do, that is raise the body off the frame???
