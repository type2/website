Subject: the Dark Side

Although my first one started locking up on me on the freeway after one
year (not built by Gary), my second Freeway Flyer tranny built by Gary Zink
of Maple Valley WA is awesome. I did not know an old bus tranny could shift
this smooth. I get right around 20mpg. This is with a stock 1600 (dual
Kadrons) or the 2110 (dual 40 dells) I used to have in it. It didn't seem
to make much difference. Anything smaller than a 1776 gets to be a bit
small for pulling hills in fourth. A well tuned 1776 does really good
though. For traveling any type of miles it does amazing things for your
sanity, as well as safety. We have a couple of stretches of 2 lane highway
(in each direction, maybe that is 4 lane?) anyway when traffic is cruising
at 70 and you can only do 55 it is pretty terrifying. With the flyer I can
easily maintain 65 (I kind of baby my rigs). For more rural cruising or
with more lanes for people to get around it is not much of a problem.
hope this helps,
