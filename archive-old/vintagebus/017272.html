Post your distributor number to the list.  That is what is important in
setting timing.  Total advance is the critical factor.  Different
distributors have different total advances and curves to get there.  You
probably want your total advance to be about 28-30 degrees, which you may
need a timing light with built in advance or a degree pulley to set.

I have a bosch 009. Some specs say set statically at 7.5btdc others say to 
set it at 0btdc, Which do I use? I'll try to find a timing light, I have a 
degree pully and have set the timin before but now I question the specs I 
used.
