I think I agree. They really do work!

&gt;single or dual port heads (whatever tickles your fancy)
&gt;single heavy duty valve springs
&gt;stock cam

Or at maybe a engle 110. Counterwieghted. Not a bad idea!

&gt;stock intake/oil bath/stock exhaust with heater boxes
Of course!
&gt;vacuum advance dizzy
&gt;solid rocker shafts/swivel feet adjusters
Not a bad idea at all.

&gt;doghouse
&gt;compufire drop-in module
&gt;full flow with Berg oil lines

And maybe a high flow oil pump.

&gt;balance it, too

Thats the real deal. Any engine built by you should be balanced.

You would like this engine, it will give new life to that bus feeling.

Jason.
