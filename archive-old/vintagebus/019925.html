was writ:
&quot;You mentioned that your rebuilder was just regrinding the used valves. Unless
you know there is less 40,000 stress free miles on them it is not a good idea
to reuse valves especially exhaust ones.&quot;

actually, after he took the heads/valves apart he told me it would be best to
replace them, which I am going to do. and then i will have a nice spare set of
heads...

what is the best way to clean the cooler, i would think soaking in something
like a carb cleaner, then blowing it out with pressured air...
