What is this list coming to when the list admin. can make remarks like that 
about people who do so much for not just the VW community, but for very 
worthwhile charitable organizations as well.  Ronnie and John are just about 
the best kind of fold anyone, VW nut or otherwise, could hope to meet.  
Perhaps if you would attend a REAL bus event, you might just realize what 
it's all about.  Until then, you might want to consider keeping your snide 
remarks to yourself, thank you very much.
