&gt; How then, can I let you have this quite nice ode to a beloved family

Hi Michael,
You can either start your own web page for your images or try posting them on 
Thesamba_dot_com website.  Then post to the vintagebus list the web address where 
the image/s are to the list for others to go to and enjoy!
Welcome to this list!
