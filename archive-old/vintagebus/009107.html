Subject: Re: [VB] more oil leak ?'s

From time to time a shop doing an oil change on my Type 2 with a 1600SP will
dump in a full 3 quarts of oil, rather than fiddling with precise
measurements.  When this happens, my crank pulley will sling a fine oil mist
until the oil level in the crankcase drops to the normal &quot;Full&quot; level on the
dipstick.  This is on a relatively fresh rebuild, with ~14,000 miles on it,
but I've had this happen on 1600SPs in various stages of their service
lives.

It's annoying, but sure beats a blown front seal.

And before I get flamed for actually paying someone to do an oil change...
I'm prevented from working under our bus by certain physical &quot;challenges&quot;.

&gt;&gt;  one of my volkswagens suffers the same oil-slinging-from-the-pulley
problem.  the engine did this from newly rebuilt.  better venting helped but
did not stop the oil from making its way past the pulley.  &lt;&lt;
