Yes, you are really following my dictum i guess, that being &quot;install the
lowest gers you can while still maintaining a decent cruising speed&quot; That
you can pull grades at 60 would tell me that you are golden...

I guess i prefer 1600's so i dont have more into my engine than my whole
bus ;)  but i do have a vanagon 2l layin around, if i can shoehorn that
in, i might like higher gears, you never know ;) but really im too cheap
to build a hi-po engine is what it comes down to (at least for
now...) Plus i travel a LOT so i like the idea of readily available spares
with no machine work neccecary, should i forget a spare part that becomes
needed at an inopportune juncture ;) (read mechanical failure in
nowheresville)

take care,

Steve
