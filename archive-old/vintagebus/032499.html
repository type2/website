&lt;&lt; is your bus not an investment as well as a hobby,  if nobody wanted bus's
 then they would not be a good investment, (just a great hobby)  and not put
 on ebay for big bucks to be sold to fat-walleted-rich-famous-overseas
 buyers,   maybe i am wrong ,     john &gt;&gt;

Well, when I bought my bus, I sure didn't look at it like an investment. I 
looked at it as my favorite form of transportation. But the first time I 
bought a vw it was for a totally different reason. It was because I saw one 
on the cover of Hot VWs at the grocery store I worked at and wanted one so 
bad that I was going to buy one outta the junkyard just to have one. I know 
what my problem is, my problem is that alot of  peoples concept of this 
&quot;HOBBY&quot; is different than mine. Not to buy the most stuff for it from ebay 
and then only to enjoy for that weekend in June in so-cal. I drive my bus to 
work. I use my bus. I love my bus. I really don't care if Eddie gets a bus, 
but I would like to know  why he wants a bus. I can't see him really enjoying 
his bus like some of us do. Is he gonna move furniture with it? Will he run 
errands with it. Will he get it dirty going camping? The whole concept of bus 
is alien to alot of people.
