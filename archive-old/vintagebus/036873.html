&lt;My favorite one on the 61 single cab is &quot;nice bus, but what happened to
the
rest of it&quot;&gt;

Thank goodness. I've had that one too. I pulled into the gas station in my
'68 Crewcab and was asked

&quot;Just what is that?&quot;

Its fun to drive a cultural icon. Do kids still flash you the ole' Peace
Sign?
