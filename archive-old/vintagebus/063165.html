Subject: RE: [VB] Hard/No Starting - long

Had this happen to me a few weeks back on my 67 Sundial-Thought I was going
to have to spend some big bucks to changeover from generator to alternator,
(which I had been wanting to do anyway).  Turned out that I just needed to
replace my voltage regulator.  Since then, everything is fine.
