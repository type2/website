Hi Bob,
WRONG!  Overtightening can over stress the lower axles and at best strip the 
threads off, or even crack the axles.  Those axle nuts should be torqued to 
217-253 Ft Lbs and thusly even a lightwieght fella wieghing only 125 Lbs with 
a two foot breaker bar should be able to not only break loose these nuts, but 
tighten them properly.
