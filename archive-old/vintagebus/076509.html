Subject: Re: [VB] Fresh Air Box (was RE: [VB] Vent wing latchs)

----- Original Message -----
&gt; speaking of rivets, what's the correct rivet to hold together the
&gt; overhead fresh air box internals?  I assume it's supposed to be riveted...
&gt; (mine isn't and the internals are currently sitting in a box, awaiting
&gt; installation).
&gt;

When I did mine, the only rivets I could find at the local hardware store
were 1/4&quot; and 1/8&quot;. The holes in the flap were somewhere in-between. I
really didn't want to drill the holes up to 1/4&quot;, in case I ever came across
the correct size (plus I would have to open up the holes in the rubber
gasket too), but next to the 1/8&quot; rivets were packs of small washers made
for riveting a smaller rivet into an oversized hole. Worked perfect, and if
I ever came across &quot;correct&quot; rivets for a good deal, I can put those in with
no damage done to the flap. Super cheap  too.
