Subject: Life with my &quot;new&quot; welder....
Mime-Version: 1.0

A few months back I sold off some of my VW stuff in order to get the $$$ to 
get a welder. My &quot;not so trusty&quot; little Chicago flux core wire feed welder 
had bit the dust. I ended up buying a Lincoln SP-100T true MIG gas welder. 
Only problem was...then I had to come up with the money to get the gas!!!!

Well last week I finally got a tank of gas. This past weekend I did a long 
overdue cleaning of my home shop and got myself and my tools organized to 
hopefully help get back on track with fixing some of these VW's I've got.

Last night I fired up my welder for the first time and practiced on some 
sheet metal pieces I had around. All I can say is that if you your doing 
your welding with a flux-core setup.._dot_definatly do whatever you need to &amp; 
get a true MIG gas welder. Man...it is SOOO much easier. The first little 
1/2 bead I made was perfect!. I then went ahead and ran a long bead, just 
to do it, and it was great as well...even though it warped the sheet metal. 
I knew it would, but just wanted to see what exactly would happen and to 
see how the bead came out.

I then separated a couple of pieces of sheet metal so there was a gap 
between them and welded them together in spot sections, filling the gap as 
I went. I used water to cool the spots after I welded and ended up with no 
warpage.

So now I'm about ready to start working on my wife's bug 'vert. I've got to 
do some sheet metal welding on it and it'll be good practice for when I get 
to my bigger welding project...my '59 Euro single cab truck. I've got some 
tricky welding to do on the decklid of her car. I've got an older style 
decklid that I paid $20 for. I'm gonna be welding in some louver sections 
off of her old decklid so it'll work with the 'vert. I plan on spending a 
day doing it and taking my time so as to keep warpage to minimum.

All in all I'm real happy with the welder purchase so far and I look 
forward to only getting better with my new toy. Glad to have something to 
get me excited about working on the VW's again. Also seem to have found 
some &quot;not like me&quot; music for my shop that seems to be setting a good 
inspirational tone for working out there. It seems to be a nice break from 
punk stuff I usually listen to. Looks like the VW burnout is starting to 
slowly wear off.

I do have to say that when I get my wife's 'vert done, I'll probably go 
ahead and put the 'ol &quot;For Sale&quot; sign on my '59 Kombi. I think I'm ready to 
let it go and get on to bigger and better things. That's still a few months 
down the road, but just kinda getting myself ready I think.
