&gt; &gt; &gt; no gas in face, no engine fire from metal fuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; line thru fan housing. Engine's out.

&gt; &gt; Are you implying that a rubber fuel line through a hole
&gt; &gt; in the tin is safe?
&gt;
&gt; Yup, it's double-walled neoprene, very stout. And you can line the hole in
&gt; the firewall, NOT the tin, with split VW fuel line if you wish to have a
&gt; gasket there. I don't bother. The hole was smoothed out, and the incoming
&gt; line has never shown any abrasion at all in 15 years, and two buses.

Rubber lines are passed through holes in sheet metal quite often in
automotive applications.  A rubber grommet, or even better a metal flange
around the hole will protect things well.

My '71 bus came to me with a rubber fuel line passing between the front
tin and the firewall seal.  It had been that way for &gt;10K miles, which is
when the engine was removed by a mechanic for a clutch problem.  That
&quot;mechanic&quot; is no longer in business, thank goodness.
