&gt;Now I am in the situation of letting someone borrow a bus which was running
fine to begin with and blowing a motor while they had it on the road.  I
have never been in this before and I am looking for some tips to help keep
this from ruining a great VW friendship.  Anyone have some basic &quot;guidelines?&quot;
&gt;
He wasn't cruising at 90 mph in 3rd gear so I wouldn't hold him responsible
for anything.  It probably would have blown up next time you drove it somewhere
of distance.  I say guilt him into being your engine rebuild bitch-slave
or the cash/trade equivalent of that.

P.S. Thanks for the bastard 40hp air cleaner, I think it might have been
NOS or barely used, the insides are perfect.
