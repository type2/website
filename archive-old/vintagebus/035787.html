Hi,

How is the air cooling/heating system made up in a bus? Where are the vents or
the buttons to control the air? Where does the heat come from? How come my dad
says that they are hard to heat in the winter?

How is the engine kept cool? Are their vents on the outside? Or what?

Does the small engine of the bus have any drawbacks? My friends at school say
that 51 HP wouldn't even budge it! What other size engines are their for the
bus? Whats the top speed of the bus on a flat surface.....or goin up a hill?

Many thanks!
Matt
