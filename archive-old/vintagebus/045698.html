This page is not outstanding but at least it is quick!
Jan &amp; I snuck into the campground on Saturday &amp; left very early Sunday 
morning.
But I did take a few PICS and have them on my website
There were a mass of really neat buses, about 18-20
They ranged from an early singlecab, lateish doublecab, combis &amp; deluxes with 
a few outstanding westy's with tents.
