Subject: Rancho 3.88 tranny
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Can anyone tell me if there is someone in the Phoenix area that sell the 
Rancho 3.88 tranny and about what do they go for?  The original tranny in my 
'61 DC has been rebuilt twice in the last 7 years and it started making noise 
and vibrating right after getting back from Corona de Tucson.  I think I'll 
take this as a hint that it is just too worn and ready to retire.  As long as 
I'm considering replacing, I think I might as well go for the gearing and let 
the 1915 do its job a little easier.  A good percentage of the 250-300 miles 
a week I put on the truck are on the highway, anyway.

I think I would like to keep the small nut reduction boxes, though, mainly 
for the ease of bearing replacemnet.  Anyone out there see any problems with 
this combo or have any comments/insights?  This is something I will need to 
do fairly soon as the DC is my main(almost only) source of transportation.  
That's why I ask about sources in Phoenix.

Thanks in advance,
