Subject: Re: [VB] LONG 1st jerome trip, The other side my view.

  And yet another take on Jerome

   Started out Friday morning at 6 am when 4 buses met at Circle K to head out. We left Havasu and got up to the pilot 
where we met Rex Eastman, that turned our group into 5 buses, my 60 swivel seat, my 60 DD lowrider, Tommys 61 
Westy, Steves 70 Bay window and Rex's 68 to 70 baywindow. We let Cory set the pace in the swivel seat and it maxed 
at 55 mph, glad we put the 670/15 tires on it the night before otherwise it would have been 50 mph. 
   All the buses ran flawlessly with the bay windows falling way behind on the hills. Amazzingly enough the swivel with 
stock trans and an unknown 1600 never faultered and went 55 up and down hills like it had a big bad ass motor in it.
   125 miles later we all stop at Saligman to get gas and strech our legs, use the potty, get more coffee etc. I broke out 
the infered temp gun and decided to shoot the engines in all the buses, the results
1. 60 swivel with 1600                      289 degrees
2. 60 DD 1800 stroker                      269
3. 61 Westy   1600 sp                      249
4. Rex's bay   1600                          239
5. Steves bay  1600                        228
   I could still pull the dipstick with my fingers and when I shot the oil it was oil 170 degrees!!
Just goes to show how the bays cool better
  
  The rest of the trip up was uneventful, got there, my usual spot (been there the last 6 years) was all ready, we set up 
camp and proceeded to do the Jerome thing (nothing),

  Seemed to be filling up on Friday and with the haphazerd parking it became more and more difficult to navigate 
through the event. They really need to control how people park. You would walk around then have to cut through 
someones camp to continue, most people didn't mind, but some got very defensive. On my first walk about I scouted 
out where I thought the trouble would be at night and  from Craigs account I picked the right group/area, right by him!
  All and all it was the smallest Jerome I had ever seen (this was my 8th one), but looked full do to the way people 
parked. The biggest problem I heard of was the beer thief. Somebody started to raid coolers during the raffles and 
steal beer, then that night hit about every cooler they saw stealing beer and food. They were in for a shock when they 
stole the NA beers from our camp!
   The weather was perfect for Jerome, being I have been there with rainstorms and winds that made it miserable. 
This last Jerome had the best weather I have seen in all the years I have been there.
  A kudos out to the guy who made ice runs and did it for what it cost, I did tip him more then the ice cost!
  All in all it was the quietest Jerome I have ever been to and appeared to be the most trouble free one also.
  Kudos to the ABC for putting on another great event.
  I also got a trophy for Custom bus with the DD lowered panel
