Subject: Re: [VB] Re: A new engine.

Pat did blow a head gasket but, not because of the engine or the  conversion. 
He read in the Bentley that you should use new head bolts when you  change 
the gasket. I told him that it would be fine not to. He wasn't sure of  that and 
didn't torque it all the way for fear of breaking the bolts. So now he  
bought all new head bolts and it's going again.
