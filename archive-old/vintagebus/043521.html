&gt;OK, my bus is suposed to have a govenor below the carb.  I plan to put
&gt;on there.  The trouble i am having is that the gov set's the carb (30
&gt;pict-1) over 1&quot; taller on the intake manifold (single port).  This seams
&gt;to mess up the routing for the accelorator cable.

I don't know if my Bus came stock with a governor - right now it has
a 1500, a 28 PICT-1, and no governor.  The carb doesn't sit right on
the flange on the intake manifold - there is a spacer with flanges on
either end between the carb and the manifold.  There are two long bolts
that come through the intake manifold flange, the spacer, and the carb
flange, with nuts on top of the carb flange, that hold it all together.

If I remember right this spacer is about 1.5&quot; (about 4 cm) tall.
Maybe one of these spacers is what you need, at least until you can
get the governor put on.
