Subject: Re: [VB] Berg Extractor and tow hitches

&gt; Speaking of hitches... Did we ever find anyone making them these days?
&gt; I  really do not want to have to make my own.

About 6-8 months ago there was a guy that goes by Navy Dave that made
repro VWOA hitches... I believe he was selling them for $250 + shipping...
Unfortunately I no longer have his contact info... Does anyone out there
know Navy Dave or how to get ahold of him?
