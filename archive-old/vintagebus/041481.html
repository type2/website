&gt;  In fourth gear, with a stock 1500 (or 1600 or that matter),
&gt;  you CAN NOT go to fast. They where made to run WOT all day
&gt;  long.

Ive seen this WOT thing expounded a number of times as if it was found on
some secret tablet chisled by ferdinand himself. I wont buy it until 	I
see the tablet in person.
