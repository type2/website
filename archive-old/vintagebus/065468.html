Subject: Re: [VB] RPM's

What sort of rpms are you getting now?   Is the rear axle nut 36mm or 46mm?  
The 46mm rear axle nut means you have a 1.26 reduction, and the 36mm 99% of 
the time means a 1.39 reduction.  ghias don't have redux, so if a ghia was 
going 70mph with the 
1.39 it'd be 70/1.39=50 mph
1.26 it'd be 70/1.26=55.5mph  
( ya, I'm ignoring tire size here)
Buses and ghias came with .82 4ths, but bugs came with .89 4th (lower)   If 
you have a bug 4th, it limits your top speed (but you can pull hills!) 

The 66 came with the 46mm, but it could have been swapped sometime.   The 
other thing I have noticed is that people new to VWs tend to shift up earlier 
than they should, as newer cars are quieter.  You may want to borrow or 
install a tach to find out some actual numbers.

Re tires:   I have 195 75 14 tires on my 65, I wouldn't run anything smaller. 
  You may want a 205 75/14, or even find some 15&quot; bus rims and use 205 75 15s.

How fast are you trying to go?   Is 55-60 mph way too slow for you?  Or is it 
whining the p&amp;ss out of the motor at 55mph?  Is your son happy with the 
gearing?( I mean, it's his bus, right?)

&lt;&lt; My son and I are trying to restore his 66 split window. It is in good
 mechanical conditon.He drives it daily. When i drove the low (?) gear ratio
 drove me nuts. No need for first gear really and I am not sure what we can do
 it help it cruise at a lower RPM. What I have gleaned from lurking here is we
 can
 1) put on bigger tires                         simple,cheap, what size??
 2) remove the reduction box (?)          drops the back down a few inches?
 3) Have the tranny rebult                   sounds exspenive
 
 What have y'all done? and what results have you gotten
 Thanks
