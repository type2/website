what's a &quot;cell phone&quot;? do i need to drill holes in my dash? i don't smoke,
so maybe i should look into this?  :)

i won't get around to the spare parts pic today, for all who may care, but
i may get to it on friday. yes, the puller did work excellently on Dawn's
bus--saved everyone from tearing their hair our trying to get the arm off
the shaft-and only took a couple minutes versus the ??? time that had
already been spent trying to get it off. the hammer was just an additional
luxury, although not needed due to the puller.

&gt; Don't forget a cell phone as well, unless you're good with smoke
signaling.

&gt;like the puller for the clutch shaft arm, a life saver you were for Dawn
and
&gt;those helping her. Oh ya, also your BFH.
