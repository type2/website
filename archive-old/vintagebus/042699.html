Nope,

My bus has been 12v since 1984 at least (thats when it was last driven
before i got it and it already had a 12v starter/flywheel/gen/battery...)

all that changed as far as the starter goes was better grounding of the
transaxle to the body... as i put the same flywheel and starter back in
after changing the transaxle.

peas,

Steve
