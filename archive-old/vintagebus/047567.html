er, well, it's like this.  sometimes VW decided to change the way they 
painted the buses, and sometimes between April 61 and 63 the dash is the 
colour of the top half of the bus, rather than the bottom.    But anyway, 
seeing as this is a panel which generally was all one colour that previous 
sentence is irrelevant.  the cab/dash should be the colour the outside of the 
bus was painted, whether the outside was sealing wax red, dove blue, ruby 
red, or pearl white or whatever.  The cargo area  would be grey.  why paint 
it when there is just cargo in there?  I think was their idea.   A VW was a 
cheap van, right?  the engine compartment the same as the outside of the bus.

 I'm pretty sure the cab/dash of every panel was white, the cargo bay was
 flat gray.
 
 You really should subscribe to the vintagebus list as they have the world's
 masters there for this sort of vintage/resto thing. (Er, and world's
 mastresses, sorry Clara! =^)
 
 &gt;Hello there,
 &gt;   I have just recently purchase my first panel van.  A 1962 and the
 &gt;original owner pianted it, for some odd reason with tremclad.  I was
 &gt;wondering what the original colour of the cargo area is?  the original
 &gt;colour is white but I need to know was the cargo area a different colour
 &gt;and is the dash, doors, and driver's area the same as the exterior?
 &gt;   This would be a big help for me because I am in the middle of a full
 &gt;restoration.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;Thank You
