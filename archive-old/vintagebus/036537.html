i have seen this bus in person, and it is amazing. maybe not 10 g's
but after what i've seen some junk campers sell for it is a bargin
in is all original state, interior is almost flawless, has a NEW engine
and all
associated parts, thats worth a couple g's right there, needs no body
and
or rust repair, etc. and is an original!!! bus, not molested or has had
a so called resto done to it, so go for it, sell it, take the money and
run
heck beto has a nice 500 dollar camper i sold him and he use's it, you
can
do the same, i know of a couple 67 pop top westys for around a g a piece
that run and drive!!!!!! who knows, i have had some generous offers from
japan for my 66 hardtop deluxe (church bus) but would like to see it get
restored or refurbished over here and used, but if it don't happen, it
don't happen and i will sell it to japan.

with a few buses for sale and a dune buggy also!!!!!!

First off it is a decent looking bus you have...but If
you are gettin' 10k for a late split westy with no
roof rack and wrong tent, and it is not a 100 point
show bus...take that 10K and RUN!  This buyer has
obviously too much money on his hands...not to knocj
your bus but 10k?...that is a lot of coin for that
bus.

&gt; hi guys, i need your help and opinions here.
&gt; 
&gt; i recently put my bus up for sale on VW planet, and
&gt; now i have a very
&gt; serious offer on it.
&gt; 
&gt; the problem is, it appears i might be all talk, and
&gt; no walk.  when i put
&gt; the ad up, i though, &quot;yea, if someone offers me this
&gt; amount, i'd take
&gt; it&quot;, but now i am faced with it, and all the
&gt; memories of me and my wife
&gt; and the bus, and how we took our honeymoon in it are
&gt; coming back to me
&gt; in full force.  im sure some of you know how i feel.
&gt; please tell me you
&gt; do.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i asked what his plans are for my bus IF he
&gt; were to buy it, and
&gt; he said he owned a dealership in japan, and planned
&gt; on doing a full
&gt; restoration on the bus, and shipping it to japan to
&gt; sell there. now, the
&gt; idea of my bus going to japan doesnt turn my fancy,
&gt; but i could
&gt; definitly use the money to pay off my credit cards
&gt; that ive got left
&gt; over.
&gt; 
&gt; im just wondering what some of you guys might do if
&gt; you were in my spot,
&gt; and what your views are about our buses going to
&gt; another country, far
&gt; far away.  
&gt; 
&gt; im soooo torn.  im sure im going to regret either
&gt; decision that i make,
&gt; but before i make it, i would really apreciate
&gt; any/all input from those
&gt; of you that have sold buses that you really cared
&gt; about.
&gt; 
&gt; thank you in advance.
