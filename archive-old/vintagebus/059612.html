Subject: Re: muir in a tech mag

i read the article in question at my grandpas over the weekend.
it glowingly described how the idiot book made hippies comfortable with
technology, thus paving the way for the internet and the vast grokking of
creative types and computers. or sumpin.
i took issue with the vw-bashing, however... unreliable, underpowered, etc.
when attempting to discuss the technological marvel (circa 1939!) that is
the vw engine, he glared at me and stated that 'only idiots bought cars
from nazis.'

he also made us park the rental new beetle in the garage, so the neighbors
wouldn't see it!
