Subject: Re: [VB] VIRUS 

Ditto that for me.  I have been sent the worm/virus 4 times now.  No one has
said anything about getting bad mail from me yet but it could happen.
Unless I send you an Email telling you I'll be sending you an Email with an
attachment with an Email, don't open it.

If you get an email  from me with an attachment, don't open the mail. I
opened a mail from charles overton(list member??) this afternoon and was
infected w/ the worm virus. my computer sent out alot of emails with
attachments. many went to list memebers but where returned due to a hidden
domain. If we have p-mailed look out. I think the subject line would read
