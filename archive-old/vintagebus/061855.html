I have to agree with Charles about your clutch. It's probably slipping, 
but maybe not bad enough to let the engine run with the bus stopped. Try 
this: Find a hill that you can normally drive up in 3rd or 4th gear. Get 
the bus going uphill in the low end of the rpm range for either 3rd or 
4th. Floor the gas pedal. If your engine revs up, but the bus doesn't go 
any faster, the clutch is slipping. It won't be hard to tell. If it 
slips, it will rev way up.

Did the shop have the engine out for any of that work? You might want to 
check the clutch adjustment if they did. There has to be some free play 
in the pedal, about 3/4&quot; is good.
