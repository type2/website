Hi All,

I'm just getting back on the list ater quite a hiatus.  You see I was
involved in quite an accident in my split a little over a year ago.
Broadsided by a car going 40-50 mph.  But I'm still standin...I have posted
a picture at http://www.dbsitebuilder_dot_net/66smash.asp .

Anyhoo, Although postponed, I still have a trip up to Alaska, (from FLa.),
planned.  Right now I'm building a 63' Panel, with the reminents of the
camper I had in the 66'.  Any &amp; all inquires are welcome, as I am still
roughing out the itinerary/route.  The tenitive plan is to leave in the
spring  of next year, and hug the southern states, then move up the west
coast, twards the beginning of summer.

Check out the pic, and let me know your thoughts on the trip.

Thanks

Kevin Albrecht
