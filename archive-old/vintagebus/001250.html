&gt; YOU PEOPLE ROCK!!!! The amount received so far is $559.00 and this is only
&gt; thru pen-pal' I haven't gotten any mail yet! Can't wait for Monday
&gt; delivery..........
&gt;
&gt; I thought I would answer the questions asked of me personally directly to
&gt; the list instead of individually.
&gt;
&gt; 1) A specific, LIST ONLY, pay-pal account has been set up at
&gt; tedebare_at_one_dot_net.
&gt;
&gt; 2) I know nothing about the computer end of the list, so please direct all
&gt; computer related ideas and suggestions to them. I have forwarded all the
&gt; computer messages I received from you all to them. ( I'm pretty sure I got
&gt; all of them.)
&gt;
&gt; 3) Checks should be made out to Type2 List Fund.
&gt;
&gt; You people are great- keep it coming- LONG LIVE THE LIST
&gt;
&gt; More to follow..... TBear
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; To leave the list, send an UNSUBSCRIBE message to TYPE2-REQUEST_at_TYPE2.COM
