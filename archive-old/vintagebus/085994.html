&gt;&gt;  Page K-2 12a of the '63-'67 Bentley mentions this change, but doesn't 
have a  picture.  It shows the change as happening in December 1965 for the  
mid-1966 models.  &lt;&lt;


Hi Volks,
It was also used as early as the 1963 model year with the intro of the 1500  
optional engine.  Good idea to use a fender washer, and hose clamp on the  
conduit on the forward side of the fan shroud to lock the conduit into  place.  
Otherwise we have had this tube kind of ratchet up the cable and  lock up the 
carb linkage.  Plus get the 111 721 551 Protective  tube - Accelerator cable or 
the modern equivalent below.  Either will need  shortening.
