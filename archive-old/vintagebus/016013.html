Hi,   I hope to be a member.  I think I signed up in the web site but
still have to mail my 15$ to an address in Lemon Grove.  Is there a cool
bus at this address as I could just swing buy with the 15$ as I work in
Lemon Grove.  I can never resist stopping to check out a split window. 
Anyway I should be able to get to the show at Bob Baker, cant decide to
bring the wife and kids though?........see ya                Jon in La
Mesa
