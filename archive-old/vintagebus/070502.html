&lt;&lt; If the gear oil that goes into the reduction boxes stays in the boxes and
 doesn't migrate to the center section, and the reduction boxes don't have
 sensitive brass parts, can't we use GL-5 rated gear oil in the boxes in a
 pinch?
  &gt;&gt;

The gear oil in the RGBs and center section are connected.  They mix.

try this.... next time you change your gear oil, leave the center section 
drain plugs out, and fill a RGBox.   Watch as the gear oil starts pouring out 
of the center section.  It flowed to the middle through the tube from the 
RGBox.  It's like a habitrail.
