&gt; I didnt know that story, but it sounds interesting and I'd love to see a
&gt; picture of it if anyone digs one up. I dont live in So Cal anymore but
thats
&gt; my fav burger joint whenever I go back for visits.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Reading my stepdaughter's work mag from In-N-Out;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;Jon has been a part of In-N-Out Burger since 1966, when Harry Snyder
&gt; first
&gt; &gt; contacted him to make signs for the company.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &quot;Jon's first job was to put a sign on Harry's old Volkswagen work truck.
&gt; &gt; Harry wanted the letters printed backwards on the front so that when he
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; driving behind cars on the road they would be able to read the sign in
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; rear view mirror.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So In-N-Out had a VW truck (singlecab)? Pre 1966, where is it now with
its
&gt; &gt; neat decals?
&gt; &gt;
