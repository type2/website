I am not saying there isn't something wrong inside the motor, but you said 
the compression was good-did you just get it checked?- had you recently givn 
it a tune up with new Bosch parts, set valves, adjust carb etc?   How is the 
end play?  WHy did that guy say there was something wrong inside the motor?  
what points him to think that?

 I'm wondering about the =

-  -- - - 
in the frnt of the nose cone is supposed to be a nose cone seal that seals 
the opening around the hockey stick (HS) there.   Sometimes (often?) it isn't 
such a good seal anymore, and gear oil oozes, but rarely pours.  The rubber 
cover there at the front is a dust seal.  Yes there is suposed to be a shiny 
rod poking out the front- that is the hockey stick.  There is a shift coupler 
attached to the front f that hocky stick.

In addition to the leak, shifting has gotten really weird.  The gears =

normal.  A few weeks ago, suddenly the shifting was really tight, like =

the usual play in the shifter was gone.  Now it's gone back to the other =

time.  The linkage appears fine, nothing amiss in the front shifter area =

or the rear coupling.  Is this a sign of a dying tranny?
-  --  - -
could be, but the 3rd/4th thing tells me to look first at that rear coupler- 
the one attached to the hockey stick.   Lie unde rthe bus with a flashlight 
looking at it while your helper sits in the drivers seat and while it is in 
neutral (engine off) moves the shift stick side to side all the way.  the 
coupler should hold the rod in front of it to the HS firmly with no wist in 
the coupler.   If the coupler is moving more at the front that the rear, go 
get a new couper.  also check to make sure the two bolts in it are snug, and 
also up wher ethe front shift rod holds to the rear one.    Yes you checked 
it before, but check it again.   If your linkage is all good, well  its 
preobably in the tranny.  what does the gear oil look like when you drain it? 
 chunks?   the brassy coloured sheen is bits of synchros.  some fuzz on the 
magnets is normal.

Can anyone tell me what the symptoms of a worn throw-out bearing are?  A =

friend suggested that might be why my engine seems to emit a loud(er) =

thudding sound when the clutch pedal is depressed.
- - - - -
that does sound like it could be the TO bearing.  when you have the motor 
out, remove the to bearing and spin it, it should spin smoothy.  crunchy 
spinning throwout bearings are bad.
