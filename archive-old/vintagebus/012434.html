Brad, I just got done doing the body work on my bus. This is what we did;
any rot was cut out and new metal was welded in. then we used body filler
for any heavy filling, no more than an 1/8th  of an inch thick.Then we used
metal glaze for any feathering or filling imperfections,no more than a
1/16th of an inch thick. then we sanded and blocked and sanded and block
and sanded and blocked etc.... then we gave it three coats of primer,and
blocked with 180 sandpaper, then two more coats of primer,blocked with 320
sandpaper, then a coat of sealer, wet sand and four coats of paint. Beige
gray on top, titan red below the belt line. Finally a wet sand and polish.
this was so much work, it took four months, but was well worth it!!! We
used Sikkens one stage enamel, the finish looks like factory quality. Make
sure you know what your getting in to, it's alot of work. Good luck, Jim
