NQ~
      If that fence idea doesn't work, what about
hauling Daisy to York?  There is a strong VW crowd of
2 here.  That and I'm allowed 2 student parking
permits, and I only have one. I could just tell the
dean she's mine and get another permit.  She could
just sit behind my dorm.  Cars sit all the time. 
Town's so small everyone walks or cars don't run
anyway.  Well, at least mine doesn't.  I won't need
that 2nd permit 'till next fall anyway when my double
cab is on the road :).  The only buildings on the
block is my dorm and my ex-roomy's house.  Between the
two is the lot.  He is the other VW guy (that and he
is actually in town on the weekends).  Just a thought.
 Yes, I'm serious.
