In washington and the midwest, it's limited to the area between the ground
and top of the roof.

I see a lot of earlier buses with pretty good roof rust, and a lot of
buses with rust in the lower windshield corners.  Also in the lower 
corners of the cargo doors, and the front lower section of the cab doors.

&gt; I'm assuming it means &quot;No Rust&quot; since I live in AZ.  ;)  Of course, &quot;No
&gt; Rust&quot; has it's own meaning...
&gt; 
&gt; So are these the usual places:
&gt; Rockers
&gt; Front floors
&gt; Cargo floor
&gt; Belly pans (if installed)
&gt; Battery tray
&gt; Inside rear corners (truck only)
&gt; Lower nose
&gt; ?
