Subject: I LIED!  (A.k.a. Zorm's carbs aren't ICTs.)
Date: Mon, 9 Nov 1998 11:11:33 -0600 

I LIED!  I posted a few weeks ago while trying to get Zorm's new engine
up and running that I had a pair of Weber 34 ICTs.  And I got LOTS of
useful info from everyone.  Well, this past weekend I finally had some
time so I removed the carbs again and stripped them down.  Found a piece
of crap blocking the main gas jet on one of them - probably the heart of
my problem.  Decided to replace the accelerator pumps while I was in
there so took one down to the local VW place.

The guy took one look at the pump I had and said, &quot;That's not from an
ICT, that's from one of those Weber Brazilia things.&quot;  And He's right!
It says &quot;Brazilia&quot; right on the carb.  I just didn't realize that
&quot;Brazilia&quot; meant &quot;Brazilia&quot;, not &quot;34 ICT&quot;.  Oh well, I never claimed to
be a rocket scientist :).  Then he proceded to give me a history of the
Brazilia, conlcluding with the fact that there are no rebuild kits and
no parts available for them.  No wonder I got the damned things for
cheap.

Anyway, he did pull out a bunch of different rebuild kits and found a
pair that had pumps similar to mine that I could make work with a bit of
fabrication.  So now Zorm runs.  Has good (but not great) power so I can
get on with other things now (like getting him inspected and getting
those new LT 195/75/15 tires put on!).  I'll probably put the old PICT34
back on there next time I have the engine out.

Anybody know anything about these Weber Brazilias?
