    i believe that they are manufactured in the Far East somewheres...
exported to the US of A....
    the big difference IMHO is in the fact that they eliminate the road draft
tube that is on so many VWs... at the end of the road draft tube is supposed
to be a rubber valve that lets crankcase gases out and *no* dirty air in...
most VWs have lost the rubber valve...
    the whole setup kind of reminds me of that little can underneath a lot of
gas grills that catches drippings and crud... why i don't know.
    most of the aluminum filler tubes come with a fitting in the side to
allow the plumbing-in of a crankcase vent tube to your air filter/cleaner...
to take the crankcase gases and burn them rather than purge to the
atmosphere...
    i had one once.. it used an o-ring to seal the aluminum tube to the
alternator stand... nifty...
    i'd get one again, as i am no big proponent of road draft tubes...
amazing now that road draft tubes were phased out on cars a very long time
ago... yet 99% of all heavy duty trucks in the US still utilize this very
thing.... shame on us.

&gt; i just picked up an aftermarket oil filler from a
&gt; friend of mine. it's about 4-5 inches long and it's
&gt; billet aluminum. does anyone have any information on
&gt; these? who makes them? they apparently don't leak as
&gt; much as stock oil fillers.
