Hi Paul,
If the object to be towed does not have brakes that can be accuated by the
tow bus braking system.  Then it probably is best to keep the wieght of the
towed vehicle down to 1200 Lbs. or lower unless you enjoy jack knifing on the
road.  Of couse the lower the ratio the better for safety.  This safety can
be increased also by moderate loading of the bus and keeping the towed
vehicle as empty as possible.  Eric&amp;Barb
