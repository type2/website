Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus

Basically you need a hot wire to the coil, then jump the 
terminals for the starter to make it turn over.   That
can be done under the bus or at the ignition switch.

That's it.

&gt; The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a VERY long time.  So it goes to figure that the ignition key is missing in action.  I will eventually get around to getting either a new key or a new switch, but I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if the current engine appears salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to hot wire start thie bus.  I assume you can jump a wire between between the battery and starter some how, but does anyone know specificaly how to do this? Maybe some of you California guys have done this before! Just Kidding ;^)
