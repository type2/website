A gold star to wear on your forehead for the first one to get the right
answer to this one.
'57  36 horse motor.  Bone stock.  VJR4BR dizzy.  105-110 PSI compression.
Tune up spec's are right on.  Stock exhaust, 28 PCI carb and hand choke.
6V system.
New plug wires (Bosch), dizzy cap, rotor.
Plugs aren't too old and just cleaned and re-gapped.
#1 cylinder isn't firing, 2 thru 4 are.
Lift the high tension lead out of the dizzy tower for #1, about 1/4&quot; above
it, and then the sparks jump from the lead down into the dizzy tower
opening for #1 and the cylinder picks up and the motor purrs.
Changed wires for #1 and same as above.
Changed rotor...same
changed dizzy cap....same
It's only doing it on #1.  Push the high tension lead firmly into the cap
and the cylinder dies.  Pull the lead out so there's a bit of air space
between it and the cap tower and the sparks jump the air gap and the
cylinder fires.
I've been on this list for awhile.  Haven't asked a whole lot of questions
cuz I've been able to figure it all out.  So far anyways.
I'm hoping that there is another out there that has had a problem like
this and has already figured it out.
I haven't looked the #1 plug over completely...scrutinized it so to speak
but I will be putting in new plugs tonight just to rule that part of the
puzzle out.
Thanks in advance.
later
