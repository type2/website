Subject: [VB] OT: host needed for VW doc project
Date: Sat, 7 Oct 2000 15:26:26 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Now that xoom_dot_com has been taken over by NBC(?!!) they have imposed filesize
restrictions, probably to keep the warez kiddies at bay.  The PDFs (thanks
Rex!) and ZIPs now cannot be downloaded because they are &quot;too large&quot;.  So...

(a) Anybody know a free webspace provider that doesn't have this limitation?
(b) Anybody want to host the PDFs and ZIPs?  ;-)

I can't afford to pay for space so if I can't find a solution, I'll probably
wind up removing the ZIPs and splitting the PDFs up into RAR files, which is
a lot less convenient for users.  I do not know the usage stats of the doc
project at all since I chose not to put counters on it, there's maybe 20
megs or so of files that need hosting.  I can still handle the individual
GIFs.  The site entrance is here:

Please email me privately as this isn't really bus related ^_^ thanks!  Any
help is very much appreciated.
