Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

Urm, but the noise went away when I pushed on the clutch; the TOB
should not be doing anything at that point.

&gt; My bus has developed a funny trans noise, and it's almost funny
&gt; as in 'ha ha!' funny.  I was at a light this AM, out of gear,
&gt; foot off the clutch, and I revved it a little to get some heat
&gt; flowing.  It started making a Three Stooges sort of &quot;woo-woo-woo!&quot;
&gt; sound, which gave me a little giggle, even though I know it's not
&gt; a good thing.  The noise went away when I put the clutch in.
