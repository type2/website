&lt;&lt; I have a 28 pict 1 solex carb(i think that is the designation) Anyway...how
 sensitive should the idle screw on the side of it be? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
That screw should be 1-1/2 to 3 turns out from all the way in to run 
properly.  Turned in any more the engine should stall out.  If not you have 
the wrong pilot and/or main jetting or bad vaccum leak around the throttle 
shaft or somewhere at the intake manifold!  Eric&amp;Barb
