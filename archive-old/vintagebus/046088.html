Subject: Re: [VB] More Brake Questions

Hi, I didnt look at your pics, but you mentioned a 63 bus?   Perhaps they 
sold you 63 parts.  63s are generally considered to have the 55-63 3/4 ton 
style brakes.

...HOWEVER, if you have a one ton front axle, you used the one ton aka 64-67 
front brakes- which has slightly differnet cylinders and yes wider shoes. If 
you have this you have to ask for 64 brake parts.  in 63 it was an option to 
get a 1 ton, and also sometimes a PO has swapped the beam for a later one.

&gt;  Here is a picture of the brake cylinder I picked up today.  The part #s
&gt;  referenced in the picture are for left and right:

&gt;  
&gt;  As the caption states, doesn't the new one have kind of a funky angle to
&gt;  it?
&gt;  
&gt;  Second question concerns the following picture:

&gt;  
&gt;  Obviously the parts store sold me the wrong shoes but they swore, even
&gt;  after I said &quot;I think these are kinda small&quot; that these are correct for
&gt;  a 63 type two.  Are they?  Do I have the funky bigass drums that are
&gt;  cool but hard to find parts for?
&gt;  
&gt;  I have given up hope for getting this back on the road tonight.  But I
&gt;  would still like any thoughts on getting this fixed as soon as possible.
&gt;  I have a co-worker who has been very kind in picking me up in the
&gt;  morning and I'm afraid of wearing out her generosity.  Thanks for all
&gt;  ya'lls help.
