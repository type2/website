Subject: Re: [VB] What size radial tire ???????
To: cabayao_at_earthlink_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What about the good old 205/75/15!
Eric and Barb tipped me off on this one.
I finally bought some 6-ply LT Firestone tires in that size.
A bit expensive, but well worth it ($95 a piece w/ mounting, valve stems, and 
balance). Also---did anyone else have trouble getting a tire place w/ the 
right equipment to balance wide five rims? I had to go to a really old time 
shop about fifteen miles away that only carried Firestone, but I'm happy I 
found them as I'm very happy!
