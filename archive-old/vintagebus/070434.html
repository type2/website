&gt; Reading the archives to narrow down my tire search for my 65 fakewestia, and 
&gt; one thing that confuses me is whether people are talking bay tires or 
&gt; splits - if there's any serious difference??  Is there?

Hi Joe,
Well the bay window bus is heavier then the split screen bus so the tires for 
the bay sould be just that much better than the earlier due to being 
stiffer/stronger.  What might be confusing you is that the mid 1964 through 
1970 here in the N. American market and even through 1972 Euro buses with no 
disc brakes use the same rims.
