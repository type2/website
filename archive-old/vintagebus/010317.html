&gt; I used to have a old German mechanic that when ever I would bring him a
new car to work on, it would always come back with the fuel line (metal)
secured to the left side of the fan shroud.  He would always scold me when
they weren't there.
&gt;
&gt; The line went through a small bracket that was attached via the screw that
held the shroud to the #3/#4 top cylinder tin.  I think I've seen this in a
factory book, but not sure.  Was this stock?


Funny you should mention this.  In all the years I've worked on VWs, I've
only seen this clamp once and that was about 3 weeks ago.  It was on the
line but not connected.  It's a little clamp that holds the gas line to the
left side of the fanshroud and uses the shroud bolt to secure itself.  Looks
almost like a conduit electrical clamp of some sort.  I'd never seen this
before and since I was working on a pretty original and good shape 1969
beetle, I figured it was something from the factory.  This weekend I'll be
working on a 1973 Super Beetle that had 14,000 original miles.  The fuel
pump is original and get this:  It has all original fuel lines (fire
hazard!!!).  The guy is driving the bug around town and since I talked to
him a week ago, I got him all worked up and scared about those lines (talk
about cracked POS's!!!) and that's why I got the job of replacing them.
I've never seen a more original engine in my life.
