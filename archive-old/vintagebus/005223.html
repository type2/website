 Snap-on has a super neat wrench just for changing gear oil and engine oil.
1 end has the 17mm hex and the other end had a 22mm box. It has a slight
offset and you can remove reduction box plugs with tires on. It sells for
aroung $50.00 but I think it is worth it. Check with your local Snap-on
dealer.
