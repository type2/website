Hi,

I would like to find some matching seatbelts for the '67
(usedtobeadeluxebus) The interior of the bus is bronze salt and pepper. I
have the lapbelts for the front and they are a kinda bronzesque nylon weave
and the buckles have the Wolfsburg logo on them. I you have have and want to
get rid of them let me know.
