I just did a 32/36 DFEV.  It wasn't hard at all.  If you have a space to
lay everything out in the order you disassembled it you'll do fine.  It
also helps to have a guide.  I used the Haynes Weber carburetor manual
(17.95 + shipping _at_ Amazon_dot_com).  I also used the nasty soaking stuff in
a paint can advertised as carb &amp; parts cleaner availalbel_at_ your FLAPS.
I soaked the parts for 2 days. (takes 2 - 2 day soaks because all the
parts don't fit into the can).   I haven't run it yet because the engine
is down to a long block right now for a rebuild.  The trickiest part is
the linkages.  Take pictures and lots of notes while disassembling it.
I posted the carb rebuild on my page if you care to have a look, link in
my signature.
