&lt;&lt; Does anybody know of a after-market company that makes bench seats for VW
 vans(1967)? I don't need an original, and I don't want to pay an arm and a
 leg.

if youare talking about the rear bench, they are the same through 73 or 74 or 
75.   at some point you could pull the seeat back down, and the back part was 
change, though the sits part was the same.  if it screws to the side of the 
bus you can fit it in your split, if if has clippy things on each top corner 
you can't.  where do you live?  sometimes people have extra pieces in their 
garages- maybe a listee can help you find one.
