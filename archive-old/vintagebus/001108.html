Here is a link for gas heaters,

I went to Rick Taylors gas heater seminar in Kansas city this spring and
learned alot! If he can't Hook you up no one can!


I had to buy a computer for home because of the new business I am setting
up.  Rob is helping me right now to get this thing jump started.  For those
of you who haven't heard, I am the only direct factory dealer of South Wind
gasoline heater parts for the Volkswagen heaters.  Hopefully by the gas
heater season I will have a web page up and running along with some
advertisement in some VW rags.

Ramblings from an old shop teacher,
Rick Taylor

&gt; Christian,
&gt;
&gt; Try this link:
&gt;
&gt; http://hometown.aol_dot_com/arkmirvis/heaterman.html
&gt;
&gt; There also used to be a place called BJ's Heater Service (or
&gt; something like
&gt; that).  I can't find any contact information for him tho.

&gt; Hey List,
&gt;     Killer time at BYOB and Kelly park eh, need some signs for the swap
&gt; though! I was talking to Ronnie on sunday about gas heaters and
&gt; he mentioned
&gt; of someone in colorado who remanufactures and sells them. Does any one out
&gt; there know of this and if so could provide me with a way to contact them?
&gt;
