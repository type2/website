Subject: My recent road trip...

Hi all,

I've been off line for a week or so and I'm just catching up on my e-mail
messages.  I co-drove an unassuming 15' Ryder box truck with a trailer behind
it from St. Louis all the way out to San Francisco and just flew back Monday
night.  We saw a few Busses out on the roads.  We hauled out a friend's
mega-rare 1957 VW-based &quot;Denzel&quot; race car (tied down inside the box truck) and
his '57 Porsche 356A Coupe on the trailer plus various other sundry garage
items that a moving company won't haul.  The journey across I-44, I-40 and
then I-5 was fun, frenzied and &quot;fairly&quot; uneventful.  Kathryn and I look
forward to seeing some of you soon at Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #19
soon!!!
