&gt; [Generator light came on and stayed on; new belt didn't help] Changed
&gt; the rotor, the points, and rebuilt the (remote mount) regulator/cleaned
&gt; and checked all the connections of corrosion, etc.

When you say you &quot;rebuilt&quot; the regulator, do you mean that you just
fixed the external connections to it, or did you actually open it up?

&gt; Numbers from the generator:
&gt;
&gt; Bosch
&gt; 0101206067105

Looking at other generator part numbers and doing a little Googling, the
&quot;canonical&quot; version of this is probably 0 101 206 067 .  One site shows
it as being used on a Porsche 356A, B, or C.

&gt; EG 7V 50A 26

Per Bentley, 90 mm housing diameter, generator, 7 V, 50 A, 2600 rpm
nominal.

&gt; VW2119030216

Are you sure on that trailing &quot;6&quot;?  Could it be a letter instead?

&gt; Numbers from the regulator
&gt; Bosch
&gt; 0190350030

Canonical version is &quot;0 190 350 030&quot;.  Again, Google shows a few sites
listing it as a Porsche 356 part.

&gt; VA 7V 50A

Per Bentley, variode, 6 V, 50 A.

It may or may not help, but you might look at pages 539-547 of the '67
parts manual at http://www.failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ .

&gt; These would seem to be 7V, wouldn't they?

This is the average charging voltage of the system.  To charge a 6 V
battery, you have to apply a voltage higher than 6 V to it.  The 7 V
average voltage is enough to charge the battery and overcome voltage
drops in long wires.  12 V generators are marked &quot;14 V&quot;, and some new
cars will allegedly have &quot;42 V&quot; (36 V of battery) systems someday.

&gt; It seems to me I should be running a Bosch 6V, 45AMP, W/ Regulator
&gt; attached.

Maybe.  If your Bus originally had a 1500, the regulator on the wheel
well is correct.

As John said, the brushes are the most likely problem, and if pushing
them in with a wood or plastic stick turns the light off, then change
out the brushes.

If that doesn't help, or you want to test further, you might turn on the
key without starting the engine - the generator light should be on - and
go back to the regulator and pull off the thin blue wire to the generator
light.  The generator light should go out.  If it doesn't, you've got a
short to ground in that blue wire somewhere.

You might also disconnect the battery, disconnect the wires at the
generator and the regulator, and use an ohmmeter to check both wires from
the regulator to the generator for continuity.  This isn't a perfect test,
but it will tell you if one of these wires is completely broken in half.

Also, put your ohmmeter across D+ and DF at the generator with the wires
disconnected - you should have some continuity there.  If this is an open
circuit (infinite ohms), you've got an open field coil in the generator.

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/054411.html has more information
on checking out the generator and regulator.
