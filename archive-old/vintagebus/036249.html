Hi Volks
Got a simple one thats making me feel stupid. When I rescued my 70 westy it
came complete with the infamous front spare carrier but no spare. When I tried
to mount a spare it became obvious that the stud pattern was right (wide 5)
but no way would the studs reach the wheel! Is there another piece that makes
this work or am I just a fry short of a happy meal ; )
Chuck
