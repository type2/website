hi Terry,

RE: [VB] Spring has Sprung in Nebraska

Cool that you got your bus out of storage. I went out to a farm auction
Saturday to buy a car trailer to pull my panel back from Rick's. I spent the
whole day at the auction and got a sun burn! I decided I can't buy a
trailer, they are way too expensive, even at an auction! maybe I better rent
one or do like NQ says; repack the bearings, replace the fluid in the rgbs
and tranny, and tow it back.
speaking of the wind, I thought my house was going to blow over Friday night
My front door kept blowing open and the wind was making that sound like a
train is coming.  I was afraid it was a tornado.  When I went out side the
next morning, my boat was upside down in the yard, trailer and all! I had
the boat strapped down to the trailer so I tool a rope and tied it to the
wheel and my hitch on the pick up and pulled it up right again.  The
windshield was shattered, My dash was broken due to the steering wheel
hitting the ground, my boat cover was torn and the battery was cracked,
spreading acid every where. Good thing I had put the motor in the basement
last fall. I have a $100 deductible on my home owner's insurance so I hope
they take good care of me.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
