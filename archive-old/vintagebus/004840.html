Les,
     My comisserations, regardless of how he feels about it, he's gone from
you.
    I always think that if you believe something, your life gets smaller as
the opposite is no longer possible.

&gt; All of this discussion of God and Type2's has reminded me: recently, it
&gt; seems, I have &quot;lost&quot; my best freind to Jesus. All he talks about now is
&gt; Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Honestly, the way he talks about Jesus, you would
&gt; think the guy walked on water!!!
&gt; So, my question is. . . should I find this guy a nice type II and try to
&gt; convert him??!!!!
&gt; I think I would be saving his soul, don't ya think??
