&gt; Far as I know (which isn't much past my 67), my bus came with the 
&gt; elephant-ear mirrors, they sorta wiggle a bit, and it's been part of the 
&gt; adventure for a looooong time now.  ;-)

Hi Cal,
Our 1966 printed &quot;Accessories Catalogue&quot;of &quot;Accessories Domestic Line-VWoA, 
Inc., Riviera Motors, Inc.&quot; shows the Elephant Ear, Trucker and Harp style 
mirrors in it as accessories.  Also shows the Bendix tach, the diamond plate 
steel bumpers &amp; tilt out side step, highroof accessory package tray over the 
sunvisors, wood slats kits for the all steel bus racks, by-pass oil-filter 
and lists an electronic engine lid lock they used to sell, among many other 
wierd/normal, unknown/unseen and well known accessory items!
