The  steering wheel is crooked, that is the arms from the center are not  
straight across as they should be but honestly I just noted that today,  
and have no idea if they were like that before this  work.



Hi uncleric,
What is your toe in measurement???  Steering wheel crooked requires  drag 
link adjustment, but only AFTER all other adjustments have been made.   We would 
suggest you take you bus to a different alignment place OR invest in  some 
simple tools to check your front end.
