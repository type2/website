Subject: Seatbelt anchor styles
Date: Thu, 27 Aug 1998 05:55:50 -0700

Since I can't drive the bus due to lack of brakes,
I attempted to install the PO removed seatbelts.

I cleaned the webbing by soaking in a bucket with
soap, leaving the buckle hanging out.  Rinsed a few times,
and it worked great to bring back the pliability and removing
gunk and grime.

I have 5 complete sets of belts.  By comparing lengths,
I determined which 2 were different and installed them
up front.  I assumed that the washer goes under the seat
belt anchor to space it away from the attachment and
provide some ability to rotate, and prevent pinching of webbing.

The rear belts were a different story.  There are 3 different
styles of anchors.  The ones I have are not consistent in
styles, so was unable to figure out which went where.

For those unfamiliar with the layout:  The outermost anchors
nuts are on the wheel well, fairly near horizontal, the 
remaining six on the rear near vertical wall.

The three anchor styles are: straight, slightly angled, lots of angle.
I have one slight, one with lots, and four flat, and not in a 
consistent pattern,

Which style of anchor goes where?
Which style is used for the middle seat anchor?
What color should the belts be?  Mine are an olive color.
What orientation should the ones on the rear wall be, webbing up or
down?

I think I saw one of the catalogs selling replica stickers that
would go on the seatbelt buckle, anybody remember which
catalog?

Checking the various manuals, I found a photo showing a bus
with two anchors in the walkthru area, and a mount on the 
B pillar behind the driver, along with one on the pillar behind 
the rear seat.  Obviously for a shoulder strap.
I checked my bus and found none of these.  It was a book 
published in England.  Any of youse across the pond have
these anchors?  Is this a European thing?
