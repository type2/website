Hey Guys,

My '55 single has some crazy wiring and my headlight switch gets very hot.
I decided to investigate today... This is the way I read the '55 diagram:
large red from fuse #1 goes to headlight switch.
Switch On- power goes to Black/White #56
Sends power to dimmer switch terminal #56
***********confusion is here
The dimmer has three outlets. One is #56 power from switch. I believe the
function of the dimmer is to toggle this power between 56a and 56b, one
being low beams, the other high beams. My diagram shows no wire leaving the
dimmer at terminal 56b, but there is a wire leaving this terminal in the
bus. My diagram then shows power from 56a is transferred to both #5 &amp; #6
fuse. Power from #5 is left high beam, power from #6 is right high
beam...!!! Where is the power for low beam terminals on headlights? My
diagram shows one wire leading to each headlight, when in fact there are
two. One for high one for low. Also, my theory on headlights could be wrong
here: I believe a headlight has three terminals, one is ground--one is power
for high--one is power for low. When the dimmer sends power to high, I
believe the low is turned off and vise versa when lights are at normal
position. Is this true?
*********here is how I think it should work with re-wiring-
Hot wire to switch
Pull switch sends power to dimmer
Dimmer has one input and two outputs
Push dimmer: one output gets hot, push again and this one turns off and the
other gets hot
Outputs go to fuse terminals- high and low
Two wires from each fuse- 1 wire goes right/the other left, hence one fuse
for L/R low, 1 for L/R high
These four wires go to headlights, hook up the grounds and shazamm lights
with low and high beams controlled by a dimmer relay.

Am I retarded?  Why can't I understand the factory diagram for low beams on?

My head hurts :-)
