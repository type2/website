Subject: Re: [VB] 65 Slash rear bumper



Look at this. This truck looks pretty OG and its a '67 with front slash and rear point. Maybe the
mixture is a truck thing.

&gt; My old 65 double door had mixed bumpers, pointed rear
&gt; and slash front. They were the original bumpers on the
&gt; bus. It only had 2 owners so i was able to ask the
&gt; question. It was originally owned by Pete Lovely, a
&gt; local VW dealer. He said that VW switched bumpers in
&gt; 65 but had more front slash than rear slash due to
&gt; having to replace more rears than frontsfrom
&gt; accidents, so a few vehicles came with a mix of both
&gt; bumpers until they got the numbers down on front
&gt; slash.
