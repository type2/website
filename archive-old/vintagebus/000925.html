According to the '66 SO-42 Westy manual, the official names are (in
English):

&quot;What-Not Cabinet&quot; on rear cargo door, &quot;Clothes&quot; and &quot;Linens&quot; closets on
right rear wall, &quot;Corner Cabinet&quot; in left rear corner, &quot;Storage Cabinets&quot;
under rear seats, and &quot;Ceiling Cabinet&quot; above rear hatch (I prefer
&quot;headbanger&quot; for this one, but maybe that's because I was one in
high-school).

This manual is very informative and available for download from Thom's page.
It includes some dimensions and other details for those of you interested in
refabricating/resto (including that they are indeed made from birch
plywood). I've copied all the individual bitmaps into a single PowerPoint
file for easier reading/printing. I can email it to anyone interested, but
it is large, even zipped (~2.8 Mb) - not a problem for me to send as I have
a LAN connection at work, but will be a bit slow to open over a modem at
home.

&gt;&gt; Hey Split Nosers,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   For some odd reason I thought the What-Not cabinet was the cabinet on
&gt;&gt; the left side rear when you open the cargo door.  [If not, what is that
&gt;&gt; pieces name?] It can not funtion that well in a bus that has the spare
&gt;&gt; tire well, cause that is its bottom floor.

&gt;That cabinet in the rear left corner I call the corner cabinet.   They did
not put them in the walk through westys, because of &gt;the spare tire
location.  Just in the bench seat westys.   Nice place to put stuff you want
easily acessable from the bed when &gt;you are camping.

&gt;The whatnot cabinet aka spice rack is what I take to mean the shelf unit on
the rear cargo door.  Cargo doors meaning the &gt;two doors on the side of the
bus, not the one on the back of the bus, which could be called the rear
hatch.
