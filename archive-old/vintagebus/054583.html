Subject: RE: [VB] Help with steering wheel

Hey Kyle, that sounds like the advice you gave me on how to remove my
e-brake pivot pin a while ago...

&gt;&gt;The procedure goes something like this. Sink a two and a half inch
diameter
&gt;&gt;steel bar six feet into concrete and leave approximately a foot sticking
up.
&gt;&gt;Arrange the bus over the bar and weld the e-brake pin to the bar. Call a
&gt;&gt;heavy duty wrecker in and strap around the bus at both ends and winch the
&gt;&gt;bus off of the pin. Dispose of the bus. Carefully remove the pin from the
&gt;&gt;steel bar. Place it into a bus that is missing the e-brake pivot pin.
