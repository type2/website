This might be relevant to the recent discussion about jesters hi 
engine temps in the dessert.

I have recently noticed that there is a about a 10 degree difference 
in oil temp while motoring the same route in the bus based on outside 
humidity. In the southeast it is often humid but lately there have 
been some days that the humidity was unusually low and the oil temp 
was about 10 degrees higher despite the fact that the outside temp 
was the same. Does VDO make a dew point gauge? :)
