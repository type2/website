Subject: Re: [VB] New Bus-(PICS)--suspension questions

My pics are up on the silly webpage I made:  http://mizamook.mystarband_dot_net/

And now that it's raining, and I can't drive that leaky 914, I've gotta go
install the new seals for the doublecab...

Thanks for the hints, I'll keep studying.

I hope I find that splined thingy on the wiper motor...that would make
everything great!

As far as the paint hue goes, it is definitely different...the
older/original paint is lighter.

Thanks!

Congrats on the new bus!!!!  pics? so-44s are cool.

on 66/67 wiper motors there is a nut you can undo (10mm?) then pull the
splined thingy off,and put it back on so the wipers are parked where you
want them,
without removing the wiper motor.   It is sort of in the middle, probably
hard to get to if there is a radio installed.   I can try to take a pic and
send
it if this doesn't help.   it's wher ethe shafts to the wiper pivots meet in
the middle.

go through the John Muir/ idiot book method for investigating what is wrong
with the steering, and give everything a good lube so FRESH grease comes
out.

spindles rebuild do not include new links.    Do you need new links?   you
really need to take the old ones out to check.  I think new are about $100 a
set
(takes care of both sides).  Keep any good used ones for future spares, and
keep the pins/needle bearings/bushings together as a set, do not mix and
match.
 Adjusting links and wheel bearings can sometimes take out a bunch of slop.

I've seen bad swing levers make icky noises.

there were different batches of velvet green that came out slightly
different.   also, different sun exposure ages the paint differently.  Did
you polish
the bits up?    that colour darkens with age.  Engine compartment colour is
closer to original.
