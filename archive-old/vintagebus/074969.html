  That is an original bus, including the paint. I had the honor of riding
around in that bus back at Bad Camberg 1999. It used to be an airport bus
and he still has the original warning light that goes on the roof, along
with the original suspesion and wheels. I also think that he does have the
original middle seat and it also has the extremely rare double slider only
middle floor mat! 50k is a little rich for my blood though.

if you're asking about the double sliders, it was... but the mcode for it 
(520) isnt present on the plate?? but the skylights would seem to be a hack.

that is one cool bus!!
