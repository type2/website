&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 
 Last night in my attempt to remove the front beam from my '59, I was trying
 to remove the front part of the shift rod and both of the square bolts in
 the coupler broke... damn.  The bolts in the rear coupler came right out.
 So, my question is...  Can I remove the shift rod if without removing the
 front coupler or am I going to figure out how to drill out those bolts while
 it's still under the bus???
 
 Thanks in advance.

seeing as bopth the rear and front shift rods can be difficult to find 
especially for type 2 before chassis # 835 xxx when they changed things, I 
would recommend doing what I did to my 61 when the stupif front copupler did 
not come apart.

get a thin grinding wheel and cut the thing .  the coupler that is.   I cut 
tpartway through right in the middle like cutting across between the front 
and rear rod, then cut lengthwise in two places to get the coupler off 
finnally manged to get the front part out and then peeled the reat of the 
coupler off it is kinda of trickey space to work in eye and ear protection 
are   very important

 you can can a replacemnet front coupler from Wolfsberg West, they have the 
boots to keep the grit out of the shift rod tube as well.

use grease when installing the new one, I think the tranny end one are easier 
cause they tend to have oil from the tranny on there which keeps them from 
rusting.  Stphen Gutnecht's bus had under coating all over everything under 
it, whioch had to be cleaned off to undo the front shiuft coupler for shift 
bushing replacement, used carb clkeaner for that and once the undercoating 
was oiff the front coupler came aprt easy as pie so you might consider that  
undercoiating the front shift coupler area after replacement will possibly 
make it easier some some in the future to take it apart.
