&lt;&lt; Looking at the bed of my truck, I was struck by fact that there is a bead 
of what looks like gray lead in the form of a cross.  It runs down the center 
line of the bed and then a second bead crosses perpendicular to that from 
side to side.  It looks to me like this is a seam.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Yes, it is a seam.  The gray stuff is a sealant to keep water out.  For a 
while at least....  We just wire wheeled out the sealant on our SC, and 
welded these seams up completely.  They were allowing water to seep into the 
tool bay.  This is probably the same reason the DC have thier cargo/passenger 
floor rust out so badly.
