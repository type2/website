The difference is that pointers to event announcements are not susceptible
to abuse like pointers to auctions.

 

&quot;As you know, some auction sellers

try to rustle up bids as much as they can by widely publicizing their
auction through posting repeated announcements.  It would be nice to have a
policy of moderation for this, but trying to explain moderation to some
auction sellers is impossible.  The solution was to simply ban all auction
pointers.&quot;

 

Question from uj. I have been bombarded with E-Mails to continue what I was
doing. I know that some come from the Samba, but that is not a bidding deal
and None come from E-Bay. There is one set price on The Samba,and I only do
AridZona because I can then check out the Bus for the prospective buyer, if
it is near me. I will do whatever the list managers want.  Not a problem
here. I want no special treatment, I just want to be useful and abide by the
rules.  Please let me know, uj
