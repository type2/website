&gt;The main question, is:  under normal circumstances, do I need to remove
the engine to install a thermostat?&lt;

Tom,

        You may have opened a real can of beans on this subject as there is
a lot of disagreement on this.

        Cooling flaps are not essential for cooling.  They, along with a
functioning thermostat, are essential for longetivity of the engine.  The
faster the engine reaches operating temperature the better.  

        I have performed this experiment just about two months ago on my
'69 SP (similar model as yours).  I pulled the engine and installed a set
of flaps and wired them open on my dog house oil cooler system.   This made
absolutely no difference in engine temperature!  My '69 still runs 230 at
62mph.  Any speed  faster after it is warmed up will push me into the 245
mark.  Most T2'ers agee 230 is the max you ever want to run and not for any
extended time.

        The only solutions are to rebuild the engine or else drive slower. 
I choose the latter while I am building my new engine.
