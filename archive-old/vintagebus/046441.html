&lt;&lt; but my passenger side brake light doesn't work!  When the light switch is 
on all the lights work until I step on the brakes - then the driver side

Hi John,
If your grounds for the taillights are working properly it could be the turn

dielectric grease to keep them clean do wonders!  Eric&amp;Barb
