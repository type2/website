Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus?????

The raffle bus does in fact exist, I was just at kyles and saw it in all its
beauty and glory.  Pics should be posted soon. I Couldnt get too close tho
cause of the undercover cops.

&gt;Ok where are the Jerome Raffle bus pics?  Does it exist or is this some
scam
&gt;to get us all to spend the weekend in the desert?  j/k  I have been waiting
&gt;and was curious if they were coming.
