Hi Rex,
Sounds like a loose connecting rod.  While helping to run the Vintage show 
with entry gate talked to some fellows in line about how badly thier type 3 
sounded.  Told them that it sounded bad and hoped it just needed valve 
adjustment.  Two days later got a call from Clara that these volks had thrown 
a rod through the top of thier engine and were talking about building a new 
one to get them from Seattle are up to home in Calgary Canada.  Last heard 
they had to have someone drive thier RV down to tow them home.
