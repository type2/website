Subject: As seen in 50th anniversary Car &amp; Driver Mag.

Hi Volks,
Upon reading that a photo of our 1961 walk thru panel camper  conversion (AKA 
Nermal) was in the recent Car &amp; Driver magazine, Barb  had to go out and get 
a copy.
  It is interesting that after the fourteen years and 160,000 miles we  have 
put on Nermal that finally an image has shown up in more main stream  media 
literature.  Even if it is on almost the last  page.  Having been photographed 
so many times on the road and at VW  meets.
  Some of these have been rather kooky.
  Driving into Joshua Tree Park in S. California via the NW  entrance.  It is 
a 20 mile drive from the back road highway to the  NW gate, with no turn offs 
on that road.  We were followed by a modern  jeep the whole 20 miles in.  
When we stopped at the gate the driver of  the jeep jumped out, ran up to the 
back of our bus and snapped off several  photos.  Then he jumped back into his 
jeep, turned around and drove back  the 20 miles!
  Another time we were passed in the Midwest by an American  pickup.  With 
the passenger sticking out his window at a 45 degree  angle.  Sticking out so 
far that his thighs were outside the truck, and of  course taking photos of us 
franticly.  How he did not fall out to be run  over by us we have never been 
able to figure out.
  Of course we get plenty of smiles and waves every time we  travel.....
  Here is to many more miles and years on the road!
Eric&amp;Barb
