&gt;Chris -

&gt;
&gt;&gt;So CafePress has sent me the below letter regarding my 
&gt;&gt;vintage bus items at http://www.magnobeam_dot_com/vb_store.html
&gt;&gt;A couple questions, or ponderings, for those whom have gone through this.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
Tell you what I did...............
Tried to be polite and ask speciics. They kept being vague, so I started 
ingnoring them. I figured I could be vague too. When they finally got 
around to sending me letters (previous contact was via email) I read the 
letters have good laugh and then toss them. When they tried to contact 
me by phone I givr thrm the old &quot;who's calling?, sorry, he's not in&quot; 
routine. They got tired of it and moved on. Probably to you............. 
sorry.

Greg
