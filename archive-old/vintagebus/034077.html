  I have a 3.88 ring and pinion, small nut r/b in my 62 panel (famous swap
bus)
  It is powered by a fully balanced 1776 engine specs are;
90.5 p/l
  New single port heads with 40 mm intake and 32mm exhaust valves
I don't remember the cc's but am running 7-1 compression (approx)
.040 copper head gaskets (the secret)
  High rev springs, Manley valves (pricey), silicon bronze guides
69 welded counter weighted crank balanced with flywheel (lightened 2 lb's.)
  Rebuilt rods, balanced end to end total weight within 1/2 gram (time
consuming)
  CB performance cheater cam (airplane grind)
Scat lightning lifters
New rocker arm assume. with 9 mm adjusting screws with ball ends
NOS empi single port end castings with a 34 pict 3 with 145 main jet
009 dizzy, soon to be changed to an 010 dizzy with electronic ign.
30 mm gear oil pump
CB Performance mini sump with cleanable filter (I probably will swear by
these).
Exhust is an old header i had laying around with a cheapo flaps muffler
welded on.
timing set by ear

The point I'm trying to make is that this bus gets over 27 mph cruising at
55-60 mph running 92 octane (so called)gas, with a full load, doesn't bog
down on the hills and has power to pass, YES pass other vehicles.
Driveing to Cal. cruising at approx 65-70 mph for 300 plus miles each way I
average 20-22 mph, speed does correlate to mpg. This trip has been done at
least 5 times, plus numerous other high milage road trips, i have put
approx.
18,000 miles on this engine since built without a hint of trouble.

Ask anybody who knows this bus and they can verify my facts and the numerous
people who have driven it to shows for me, ugly but runs great.

I'd like to add my experience FWIW to the 'Speed vs RPM' thread.

I've been running a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th, Big Nut tranny with 195/75 14 LT
tires and a 1776 dp/30 pict-1/stock exhaust for some time in my '66 westy
and the best mileage I can get is 16, maybe 19 with a tailwind on a trip.
My daily commute to work yields 13-16 mpg at a steady 60 mph. I've tried
different jets, carbs, distributors, checking for tight bearings, dragging
 mm gear oil pumpee if I could push a little more from this combo with no
success.  Even a recent head rebuild didn't change anything. (compression
is close to even on all cylinders-approx 125 psi)

I originally built this engine for a bug; sold the bug-kept the engine. I
didn't like the 4.37 R&amp;P so I tried the 3.88 thinking I had the torque to
take advantage of the taller gearing at freeway speeds and 13-16 mpg is the
result. It looks great on paper, until you actually get to experience it
first hand.  I think a well-built 2 liter with dual carbs might make a
better choice for a 'Freeway Flyer', but I'm not going there.

I'd be real curious to see what you guys that are running straight axle
conversions are getting in terms of mpg. And be honest!

BTW, when I had the original transaxle, I was getting up to 25 mpg with the
same engine sporting Kadrons and single quiet muffler. When I changed
gearing, that's when the bottom fell out on my gas mileage. I think I'll
chock this up to experience, and I'm going back to stock gearing or at
least a 4.12 R&amp;P very soon.

If anyone has any suggestions or can point out something I may have
overlooked, I'm all ears.

Everett
