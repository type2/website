Hi Jerry,    In a message dated 98-11-02 10:24:05 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; 1) Can I convert this pop top to a canvas sunroof fairly easily?&gt;&gt;
Sure by selling your bus and getting a sunroof bus instead.
 
&lt;&lt; 2) Anybody have a good source for Safari windshields. Are they hard to
install?&gt;&gt;
Yes, swap meets and VW classifieds.
 
 &lt;&lt;3) Recomendations for a good restoration type manual for interior/exterior
and wiring diagrams?&gt;&gt;
The idiots manual By John Muir and the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 vw bus
shop manual.
 
&lt;&lt; 4) Best way to lower vehicle height? I haven't looked at the wheel size
yet,
 but if its 15&quot; will going to 14&quot;' get me lower and are there any downsides?
&gt;&gt;
Check the list archives, lowering is a forbidden thread on the present day
list.  Make sure that you do want to lower your bus and by how much.  Many of
the easier ways of lowering are not only bad for your bus ,but can plant you
and your passengers 6 feet under.  As to going to smaller sized tires than
stock you reduce your top speeds in each gear.  If you want more info from us
on this last stuff, Pmail us.       Eric &amp; Barb
