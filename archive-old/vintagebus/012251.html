Subject: &quot;L&quot; sticker/repro's scans??
Mime-Version: 1.0

snip!


&gt; Oh yeah, here is the icing, the panel still has the silver rectangular
&gt; sticker under the code plate with the paint number and color of paint in
&gt; German (L512 Velvet Green)

hey that reminds me. does anyone know if these stickers are being repro'ed? alternately does/can anyone provide a high res scan of an original sticker which can reprinted on a colour printer.

specifically i am looking for &quot;pearl white&quot; but would really be interested in any

fwiw the &quot;original&quot; silver stickers seems to defy peeling off! any time i have everr tried to remove these stickers off of junkers busses they disintegrate in my hands
