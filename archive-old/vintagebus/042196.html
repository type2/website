&gt; ok heres the scoop....
&gt; 
&gt; i have a new mexico 1600dp with a type 4 oil cooler.
&gt; when i put oil in 2.5 quarts filled it to the top mark.
&gt; i have a gene berg dip stick sensor. i coldent drive 
&gt; more than 5 miles without the light coming on.
&gt; 
&gt; now all my tin is correctly installed all my seals are 
&gt; in place. my timing is set a 7.5 btc. nothing is in my 
&gt; fan either, now here are my questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. since i have a bigger oil cooler should i pour in 
&gt; more oil? and if so how much more?

The type 4 cooler might hold another ounce or two of oil, but not enough
to make a difference in cooling.
&gt;
&gt; 2.if i have to put in more oil should i just put in a 
&gt; deep sump?

Deep sumps don't help.  They just make it take a bit longer to warm up
the
oil.
 
&gt; 3.since its a 59. type 2 and it originaly had a 40 horse
&gt; the vents on the side arent big enough?

Possibly, but unless it's 100 plus I'd doubt that it makes much
difference.

&gt; 4. if the vents arent big enough should i put in air 
&gt; scoops?

I'd want to investigate all other options before bodging up the outside of
the bus.

&gt; oh and it was a about 90-95 degrees f. outside but i 
&gt; wasnt able to go more than 3-5 miles.

Have you checked the sensor itself?  It might be defective. put it in a
deep fryer along with a known thermometer.  Warm the oil and note the temp
at which the switch closes.  Keep the thermometer and sensor off of
the bottom of the pot and stir the oil continuously.

Be sure to clean the deep fryer completely and return it to the kitchen
before the wife catches on.
