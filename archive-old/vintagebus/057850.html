Subject: RE: [VB] FW: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!

Scam.

Why?

1. It came via email.
2. It says in a few weeks, I've seen this email for months.
3. It says you can respond to the email with REMOVE in the subject line,
this tactic is used to verify you have a valid email and that you have re=
ad
the note in order to contact you further as they see fit.  (Like sue you)=

4. If it was real, it'd be on vw_dot_com  IPProtector is a BS company that bu=
llies
people, I doubt if VW even knows they have set this up.

Anything received via email should be immediately doubted - don't delete
files off your computer, don't forward emails that say &quot;forward this,&quot; do=
n't
run attachments, don't email people to tell them they are infected with
a virus, and never respond to spam, especially when it says &quot;click here
to remove yourself from our list&quot;.

&quot;Skepticism, like chastity, should not be relinquished too readily.&quot;
