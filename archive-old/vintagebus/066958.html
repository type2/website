&gt;The wipers were working but they stopped, any ideas on that?

In this order: blown fuse, broken wire, bad switch, bad motor.  There is
a b&amp;w wiring diagram in the Bentley manual and a color one here:

&gt;Also, what are the reasons for upgrading it to 12 Volt?

You will have a little more availability and choice of replacement parts
(easy to go to halogen sealed beams, for instance) and it will be easier
to add &quot;modern&quot; electrical accessories like a big stereo.  That's about
it.  Try disconnecting and cleaning all your electrical connections first;
there's around 150 of them so do them one at a time.

Obligatory safety disclaimers: Going is optional, stopping is mandatory.
Make sure the brakes are in good shape.  Buses are attempting to evolve
into the legendary Phoenix, but so far they haven't worked out the &quot;get
reborn from the ashes&quot; part, so replace all the rubber fuel lines.

Welcome to the list!
