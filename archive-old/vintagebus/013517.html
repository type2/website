Hi Eric&amp;Barb,

What sort of acid do you use?  How is it applied?  Where do you get it?  It sounds like I could use a 55 gallon drum of it.

Exactly, that is why we alter between the acid and wire wheel.  Each runs 
into a point where they just slow down to almost a stop at working, but if 
you alter between the mechanical shock and chemical action, the rust removes 
very quickly.
