Ever since I saw that 53 at the vintage meet this summer, I was pondering
pin striping my 59 double cab.... in my quest to build a period late 50's to
early 60's street rod, pin striping has been one of those things.  Pin
striping was everywhere back then.  Of course, I don't think I'll get quite
as *wild* as they did on some of the rods back then....
