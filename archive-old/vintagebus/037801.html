Easy questions for you Double Cab owners out there:

1. Which years was the bottom of the rear bench seat &quot;flat&quot;, i.e. the lower tube frame is completely flat, no bends or anything, except at the corners?  This in contrast to the front bench seat bottom where the front of the frame bends downward to meet the body.

2. How does the rear seat bottom attach?  Is it the same as the front bench seat bottom with the 2 &quot;arms&quot; that extend into brackets at the rear of each side?

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
