An 1800 is really a fairly common engine size. These are excellent for
buses. 74 mm crank (CPR Welded) with stroker rods (CB Performance), Duel
port heads with 40 mm intakes and 35.5 exhaust (Manley valves) mild port and
match ported intakes (EMPI Kadron intakes and carbs), Mahle 88 mm cut in
P/L, CB 2239 cam 276 duration and 380 lift, Qualitat Brazil new lifter (cam
followers), CB Maxi 3 full flow oil pump (26mm gears)with key wayed drive
gear, Autocraft Chromolly pushrods with 911 Porsche swivel feet adjusters,
Achiever 3 1/2 pound front pulley with new 200 mm flywheel (lightened 3 1/2
pounds) with replaceable ring gear. New Brazil (Brazil) AS 41 case with type
3 oil fill hole (will put a block off plate there with oil temp sender),
type 3 oil cooler (the one with the extra fins) and an external 92 plate
Rapid cool with thermostat controlled fan with an O-Berg oil filter. S S
header with hideaway turbo muffler and custom made heater boxes ala Gene
Berg copy. In order to get the correct deck height and compression ratio the
heads will be CC'd and custom cylinder spacers will be made by Rimco for a 7
to 1 compression ratio.

All components of this engine have been fully balanced and checked for pin
height, deck (on case), rod lengths, etc. Hopefully this will be a 100,000
mile plus engine. See it at Red Barn, KP and ask questions if you wish.

Ronnie,

An 1800 is somewhat of an odd size engine, but it is exactly what I have
been wanting to build for my bus, bigger than stock, but still mild enough
for bus work.  What were you leaning towards as far as
cam/heads/carbs/exhaust?  Just curious....
