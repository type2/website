any and all comments, questions welcomed.

I think I probably got into this several postings into the evaluation but
here is what I see.
#1) The cam plug normally goes the other way, hollow side in.
#2) Your cam bearings look like the came out of a 60,000 mile engine.
Valve springs too tight? or cam too tight in case? Mic the journals.
#3) The only explanation for the main bearing wear is that you processed
some trash through them, if you had a good polished crank at the
beginning.
My experience has been exclusively on Type IV air cooled and the elephant
cam bearings are very hard to damage. It leads me to think your case is
squeezing the cam bearings too tight or the cam journal surface was too
large for the bearings (over sized).
My only other thought is that you had temporary oil starvation that
somehow didn't get monitored by your gauge or idiot light sender. That
can happen if your oil is foaming bad.
