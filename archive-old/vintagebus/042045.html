&gt; ,,, My story ended this past week when the fifth graders had an 
&gt; overnight trip to a local science center.  I arranged for Julia and some of 
&gt; her friends to ride with me but didn't tell them I was bringing the bus.  
&gt; When I pulled up in front of the school, Julia was standing outside. I felt 
&gt; a chill when I saw her pointing at the bus.  When we were loaded up and 
&gt; pulling out, I heard her tell her friend, &quot;It's ALIVE. Mr. Smith made my bus 
&gt; alive again.&quot; I felt another chill as i realized that I now have two new 
&gt; lifetime friends, Julia the little girl and Julia the big white bus.

Something tells me that this story will never end!  :)

My 4th grade daughter greatly enjoyed it!
