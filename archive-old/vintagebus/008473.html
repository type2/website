Subject: Suspected Electrical Problems

That same thing happened to me last week...it had never happened before.  I
just did a tune up and it all went away...for a day or so.  I finally traced
it down to the coil lead.  The metal contact part was kind of crimped closed
and was not making good contact with the coil.  The rubber boot was holding
it on fine so it appeared to be a good connection.  I pulled the boot off
and spread the metal on the lead and plugged it back in.  Since then I took
a 500 mile trip with no problems.
