Subject: Re: [VB] WTB - Type 3 Cool Tin
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Does anyone have any original type 3 &quot;cool tin&quot; they'd like to sell?  I
&gt;know there's aftermarket pieces, and they're junk.  I'd like to put these
&gt;on my engine too - my off-road friends swear by it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

The original tin is the best, but you can make the aftermarket tin hold as
tightly by taking a rat tail file and rounding out the areas that are
supposed to &quot;snap&quot; around the studs.

Most of the aftermarket tin was not rounded out enough so after a short
time, the tin would come loose and rattle.

With the original tin getting harder to get, this is a good replacement.
And BTW, you are correct, the type 3 tin will cool MUCH better, it wraps
the cylinder much further.
