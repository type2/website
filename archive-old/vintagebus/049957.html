&gt;There is a mental disease, I believe unnamed (hint hint), where as two half
&gt;broken or half rusted VW's is considered better than one good quality well
&gt;restored VW :)

It is true, also there ought to be a substantial penalty for people who
claim YARD CARS as credentials in their signature files. Yard cars do not
count.

Oooooh, lookee there, Friday will end in one minute, you'll have to wait
and flame me next week. 8)
