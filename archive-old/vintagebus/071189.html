&gt;I lowered only the right side of the bus since I was sooooo undecided
but
&gt;that was only after I installed the CE safari on the left side and used
&gt;good ol roofin tar to seal up the right (SO doesn't like the bugs in
her
&gt;teeth).

You can level the Bus back out by putting a 12 V battery in front of the
left tail light.  If you're a real vintage purist you can even strap it
down.  With this battery, you can convert the left side of your bus to
12 V, so the headlight on your side is brighter, but the right side is
all mint NOS NIB OG VW.
