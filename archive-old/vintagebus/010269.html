Subject: Fw: Its time to buy those Fiche readers from your VW dealer
Date: Tue, 29 Feb 2000 23:11:18 -0800

FYI.....

This was just posted to the Type 2 [Baywindow bus] List.
*******************************************

As most of you are probably aware VWoA stopped supporting the old MicroFiche
setups and made every dealer go to to the parts computer program.  This
happened as of the end of last year.

The old MicroFiche readers are usually still there as backup, but
disappearing fast.  My local dealer put 2 in storage and after inquiring I
could buy one of them.  It's the one I always bought parts from at the parts
counter. Many a high price was quoted to me from it.

I got it with the turn-table, the complete Fiche drawer and the separate
Audi Fiche drawer.  All the Fiches are there, even the split screen Bus one,
that I had always been told they did not have.

So if anybody has always wanted one of those setups, now is the time.  These
machines will disappear into nothingness fast, just like all the old
pre-1973 parts books.

Grab them while they are cold.
