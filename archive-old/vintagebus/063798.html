Subject: Re: [VB] Bus sights in a movie!

&gt;Does anybody remeber an old thriller/mystery movie (in color) where an
&gt;austrian/swiss/german type guy is driving an american (like claude
&gt;rains-ish sort) back and forth all over the snowy hilly ski-ish sort
&gt;of area in a
&gt;red/white deluxe? Seels like maybe a quarter of the movie is involved with
&gt;the bus. I cant fo the life of me remember what it was.
