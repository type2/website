&quot;Thick as toothpaste&quot; and &quot;never hardens&quot;, that sounds scary! Especially
around the case where tolerance is critical. Permatex 3-H is as close to the
factory sealant that I've found and I have never had a problem with it in the
last 33 years. It is the case sealant of choice for high performance engines
like Lycoming and Continental aircraft motors which are also air cooled. I
even use it on the high temp Corvair engines, once the block halves are
resurfaced of course. I would be interested on the longevity of your engines.

We carry &quot;Curil T&quot; at my work, ...

This stuff was awesome. It has the consistancy of toothpaste (even looks like
green toothpaste), and smells like aftershave. It was interesting stuff. It
never hardens, always stays soft. I used it on everything on my engine.I even
put it on my pushrod tubes, which worked out great for holding them inplace
while I put the heads on.
