Hi Kevin,
Just try the signals with the running lights on.  Both tail lights will 
weakly wink at the same time.  If you have steel bulb holders you can solder 
male electrical pieces from a destroyed fuse box to them.  Then be able to 
run a wire to both bulb holders and bolt under the battery neg. cable at the 
body.  For pot metal euro 1962-71 tail lights you have to drill and bolt the 
brass male electrical fittings on.  The pre-1970ish tail light bulb holders 
relied on a little tiny sharp point to pass through a hole in the bulb holder 
to body seal and prick through the paint to the metal to ground the bulb 
holder.  About 1970 VW woke up and realised that it did not work well for 
long and installed grounding wirng system on thier buses from then on.
