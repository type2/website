I have to say no. It seems innocent enough when it starts, but where does it
end? I remember the angst you went through when you found that your 60
wasn't a 59, next thing you know there will be a bus with fried egg turn
signals in the drive. What then? It will only be a short while before the
lure of A/C and disc brakes has you driving a fiberglass highroof camper
with baby-puke green plaid upholstery to Jerome. Oh the humanity. I never
thought it would happen to me, but there is a '71 deluxe in my backyard,
plus the grisly remains of a 68 Westy. They aren't mine, but I told a buddy,
sure, bring it over. Won't take a couple of weeks to fix it up. That hideous
hulk has been in my yard for a year now. I finally did the decent thing and
took the plasma cutter to the 68, but then the '71 showed up. I remember how
cute I thought it was when the splitties started breeding back there, first
there was one, then next thing I knew there were four. Plus they begat an
oval bug. That was all well and good, but here there were almost two fat
chicks back there. What if I am out of town when the next one is begotten? I
can just see myself returning from a roadtrip to find a bunch of Vanagons in
the yard. It just isn't worth the risk, keep the bloodlines pure. In the
unlikely event that somebody thought it was worth doing, there would be a
www.baywindow_dot_com website.
