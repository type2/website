Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

If that stud does break, the input shaft will pull straight out of the 
tranny with a slight slowdown at the c-clip. I have not had any 
problems with that stud. It does seem like a flimsy design though. I 
read somewhere that VW beefed up the design in later versions of the 
tranny. However, I have not seen one.

When I assemble my tranny I noticed that the input shafts do not 
tighten fully on the stud and allow the splined reverse gear to slide 
on properly. It may be 1/2 spline loose before it will slide on.

&gt; This causes me to wonder about the cause of that little stud breaking,
&gt; which allows the input shaft to come out of the transmission.  If the
&gt; input shaft is tightened on the stud before the splines are connected
&gt; with the reverse gear then the stud is placed under great stress by
&gt; sideways force on the input shaft.  this sideways force could be
&gt; inadvertantly applied when dropping the engine, moving the 
&gt; transmission,
&gt; etc.
&gt;
&gt; It might be better to leave the input shaft slightly (say, a couple of
&gt; splines) loose on the stud when assembling the transmission to prevent 
&gt; the
&gt; breaking of the stud.
