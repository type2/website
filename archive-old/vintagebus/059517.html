Subject: Sold my bus....

5 minutes after putting my '59 Kombi on thesamba_dot_com, I had already 
recieved 3 emails about it. Over the next few days I recieved about 
50 emails from people who in their words....&quot;wanted it!&quot;

It got sold to a gentleman from the U.K. He was the first to offer 
the full asking price and was relentless in emailing me over and over 
again pleading his case. So even though it wasn't the most convenient 
sale, I went with him anyway.

Today I got a credit of $3750 to my account. He wired the money and 
will be taking delivery of the bus in June. He's gonna drive around 
the U.S. a little with his buddy, then ship it back to the U.K. from 
Florida.

I'm somewhat sad to see the bus go. But the time definatly had come. 
I've got other bus projects that I really want to do, and this bus 
was gonna keep costing me money as I wanted to do more and more to 
it. So rather than do that I passed it along and will spend the time 
and money on my truck and 23 deluxe.

I do feel kind of good about the fact it's going to the U.K. It 
really ads another chapter to the history of the bus.
