I just had a few hippies in my shop for a couple days
doing a brake job.  Not sure if it was the AIRS list
or Ronnie's recommending me, but they were the kids
who got the long distance award at Prescott for
driving from Alaska.  Good experience overall, I think
they left more tools than they took, but it is a
little inconvenient to have your shop space taken up
for two days.  Still, I was glad to help.  They were
nice kids.

&gt; Maybe the Split Busses - which so many people are
&gt; afraid to take on a long trip without a trailer full
&gt; of spare parts- are the more reliable VW Bus.
&gt;  
&gt; Anyways, there hasn't been much discussion of list
&gt; members experiences from AIRS related emergency's.
&gt; 
&gt; So what say ye...
