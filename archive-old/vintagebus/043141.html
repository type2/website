Thom....rumor has it that you don't drive your Busses much...let alone go
out on any serious road trips...why would you even wonder how folks do
trips?????  don't tell me you're actually thinking of driving one across
the state or something!!!!!!!
Being prepared...having some essential skills....some money...and time
off.  That's all I've ever needed.  And I'm outta here!
later

&gt; Something I've always wondered: those of you who do these road-trips-from-hell -
&gt; how do you afford that?  I can't imagine taking 6 months off to
&gt; go fart around the countryside.  Not having any recently deceased rich 
&gt; relatives, if I don't work, I don't eat, and my buses don't eat.
