  I am new to the list and am requesting information about getting a bonded 
title for a 1959 single cab in Phoenix Arizona.
Bought this bus and have been getting the run a round from the DMV for about 
a year.  It has already been inspected by the DMV and I do have a notarized 
bill of sale.  What I am asking for is directions or someone to walk me 
through the process(of getting a bonded title) with  the names of &quot;Bonding 
Companies&quot;? or people that can help me out.  The car is legal, there are no 
liens.  I have no name of the person whos name the title was in last.  
Please help!
