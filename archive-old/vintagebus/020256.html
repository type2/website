&gt; The prices we pay to be cool....  Saw one like a
&gt; flaming eyeball the other
&gt; day, though.  Might have to get that one.

I saw a really cool one that was a black ball with two
little Mickey Mouse type ears on it.  If I see that
one, I'm going to get it.  Anyone going to Disneyland
after the Classic who'll pick one up for me? Rex?
