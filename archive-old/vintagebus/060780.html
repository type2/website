Subject: Re: [VB] safari window install

well, it's summer and toasty warm and has barely rained in weeks, so it's 
about time to install the drivers side safari window in the 61.  This takes 
about an hour.
But it is a factory safari bus and has the brackets welded in and the shifty 
mounting plate up on top.  

oh, BTW, safaris leak.  
But they do kick booty in the summer, especially if you have a mister bottle

 You really should find a way to install a set of MetWiz's safari plates.  I
 think this is the ONLY way to go using machine thread screws instead of
 sheet metal screws.  Sure you'll have to put a hole and weld it back up but
 the outcome is soooo much better.
 
 Good luck with all the people telling you that they will leak ;-)

 I'm having a set of OG safari windows cleaned up and
 painted by reVOLKS_dot_com. I was wondering if anyone
 could give us an idea of what we'll be up against when
 we go to install? How much time should this take? Any
 answers, tips, or intstruction would be greatly
 appreciated.
