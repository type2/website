&gt; I was told that all octanes and additives are added when loading in a truck
&gt; (by the owner of parker oil), he has raw fuel in which they add the

I believe that the fuel, as delivered, meets the ASTM specs.  The only
things added are the brands' own &quot;snake oils&quot; such as Chevron's
&quot;Techrolene&quot;.  These additives are ususally in such small quantities that
they do not affect the fuel quality.

&gt; I
&gt; did a fuel test going to kelly park when busavaning with VWHoward, he always
&gt; uses premium fuel where as I was useing regular for half the trip. the only
&gt; performance problem that I could notice was a loss of about 1-2 mpg by
&gt; useing the lower octane fuel,

With such a small difference in mileage, there are many different factors
that could account for the difference.  Although you were travelling
together, there were still two different feet on the gas, two different
brains selecting shift points, etc.

The only way to sort this out would be to use the same bus for the test,
run the test on a road where the test would be repeatable at constant
speed, and have a way of rapidly measuring fuel usage and a method of
switching quickly from one fuel to another.

Figure on a few hundred for fuel flow sensors, another couple of hundred
for the second fuel tank and electric valve, and a few thousand to rent
the General Motors Desert Proving Ground for a couple of hours.  :)

I will say that higher octane fuel _does_ give better mileage in a modern
car that has a knock sensor and is designed to run on high octane fuel.
Running lower octane fuel will cause the engine management system to
retard the timing, making the engine less efficient.

Our VWs don't have the benefit of EMS, so as long as the fuel doesn't ping
it shouldn't make any difference what the octane is.  Gasoline has the
same heat energy per unit mass regardless of octane.

I did a lot of fuel research while working on my degree (many moons ago)
and learned that the most important factor in purchasing fuel was the
cleanliness of the station.  Scummy looking stations usually have slovenly
habits about maintaining their storage tanks as well.  Usual contaminants
were water and dirt, but every once in a while we'd get a sample of
gasoline that contained a fair percentage of diesel (diesel fuel was
cheaper than gas then) and even what seemed suspiciously like crankcase
drain oil!

My usual policy when travelling is to buy gas at the cheapest stations
that are well-kept.  I've found that my Mexican engine runs fine on
regular and I've never heard even the hit of a ping from it under the
worst conditions.
