I really don't think anyone will have a very good answer for you. I'm
just beginning to start learing abt jetting carbs so my experience in
this area is VERY limited. I believe there are some good milestones
out there for different configurations of engines, but each one must
be &quot;dialed in&quot;. that is running some tests and looking at the data
that comes back. This can be as simple as just looking at the plugs to
try and determine how rich/lean you are running, to checking the
exhaust w/ a EGA and compare it there. Add in the additional variables
of heat temp, oil temp/pressure, etc it can be a lot of info. 

Now, you happened to throw in an extra bit of info. 2 drastically
different elevations. I think what you are gonna need is to dial it in
for both elevations and swap parts if you are there long. If it gets
dialed in for low elevations, it will be incorrect for high, and vice
versa. This is prob one of those times when FI is a good way to go.

John at aircooled net has a write up about jetting it might help
