That's what puzzles me. First the guy says it's a Kombi and then that it has
13 windows, no middle seat. Well, OK middle seat could of been taken out at
some point. I didn't get the VIN # from him. He waited three weeks anyway so
I don't want to pull his leg. If there's something goofy about the whole
thing, I'll just walk away and just enjoy my trip. Problem is I'll be
hauling a trailer all the way from Chicago.

Well, we'll see.

Anybody has that windshield glass????


Thanks,

Andre



&gt; What is the vin [serial] number of this bus?
&gt; The 1st 3 numbers will tell you what it is.
&gt; 13 windows and two-tone paint says it is a hardtop deluxe.
&gt; A standard has 11 windows. Same as a kombi.
&gt; Either side windshield will fit in either side. If you put a drivers side
