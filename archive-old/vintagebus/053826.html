Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

I've been pinned, burnt, hit in the head with many a tool, and blinded by 
all sorts of gunk and goo.  Growing up on a farm in South Western Oklahoma 
gives you plenty of opportunities to injure yourself whilst working on all 
types of machinery (not to mention and older brother brother putting you up 
to doing all sorts of crazy stuff, like peeing on the electric fence and 
sledding into a canyon).   So here is my worst.  While in college I had 
bought a '76 Pontiac Bonneville w/ 51,000 original miles, a 400 and 
imacculate interior, one of those little old person cars you always hear 
about for 750.00.  Well, I was in the process of replacing all the rubber.  
One hose in particular wich ran from the air cleaner and had a thick metal 
wire spiraling through got me, the wire hooked into the base of my right 
middle finger and instinctivly I pulled back.  Wrong thing to do....  It 
sliced pretty deep and left all the muscle tissue and unsevered veins 
hanging out of my finger.  I cursed and hollered around for awhile finding a 
clean shop rag to stem the bleeding.  Finished up what I was doing and 
wrapped it with gauze and tape after putting some peroxide on it. 3 days 
later, with lots of pain and little movement in my finger I went to the 
doctor and he ended up cutting my finger open again and stitching it up.  
Still have a big scar and can't bend my finger all the way down.  Thats not 
bad though I know, but was my worst.  While working as an EMT in the Navy I 
seen a saior working on a car and get his head crushed, when the car was 
removed he died.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Last night I was working on the engine and had my left arm across the
&gt; &gt;top when my steel watchband crossed the terminals on the alternator.
&gt;
&gt;I did a similar but not as drastic thing when I was working on my
&gt;F*rd T*mp*.  I was changing the coolant and hoses, so my arms were
&gt;wet with sweat and coolant.  I was standing by the left front fender,
&gt;leaning over the engine to loosen a bolt with a ratchet.  I laid my
&gt;right arm and elbow on a handy flat surface - in this case, the top
&gt;of the battery.  After a few moments I felt a funny tingling sensation
&gt;near my elbow and pulled my arm back to see what was going on.
&gt;Apparently I had completed the circuit from the battery positive post,
&gt;through my arm and hand, through the ratchet, to the engine.  I had
&gt;a little burned spot on the underside of my arm, like a sunburn.
&gt;Doing something like that and getting off relatively easy tends to
&gt;make you much more careful about dancing with Reddy Kilowatt in the
&gt;future...
