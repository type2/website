Subject: Re: [VB] Pitting

I think Eastwood sells either Metal to Metal or All Metal body filler it is 
supposed to be like an aluminum filler and they say it will work with there 
powder coat system, but we have tried using it on engine tin and heating it 
in the oven and it tried to lift. But it seems to work well on body metal 
filling deep pits on my buses rain gutters.
