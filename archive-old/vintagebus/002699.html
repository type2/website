Steven

I think it is the list members that owe you an unbelievable amount of
thanks. You have done a great job and it was almost transparent to the user.
I do not believe that anyone else could have done it.

Thanks from a happy subscriber!

. I am no longer one of the adminstrators of the type2 list.  I am
&gt; down to just another subscriber, which is exactly where I want to be :-)
&gt;
&gt; Since I am not exactly going away, just steping out of the hot seat, I
&gt; don't want to get too valedictory, but I do want to thank you all for your
&gt; help and participation thru the years
