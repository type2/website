Hmm.  And I'd just fired off an email to Lenny about price and
availability of his belly pans.

I couldn't tell from the pix I had of the BD that lenny did if they
went all the way back or not.  From Cory's pix, it looks like
there is not a stamping in the section between the jackpoint
outrigger and the last outrigger, so I could fake it with a 
piece of 18ga flat sheet with a lip braked into it.  Once I 
welded it up and ground it down, only the most AR amongst us (ie FH)
would be able to tell.

&gt; Not to mention since lenny used the belly pans from woodys panelbus to make 
&gt; patterns for his repops, that barndoor deluxe has the WRONG belly pans (Not 
&gt; to mention 20 other things).
