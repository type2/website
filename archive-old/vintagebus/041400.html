&gt; It is planned to work with an IRS bug tranny.. but i have been wondering
&gt; if an irs bus tranny will fit too as you can put an irs bus tranny in a

&gt; there would be a way to put an irs bus tranny in a split, but no-one has
&gt; answered me on that one...

Berg makes an intermediate housing that is just for putting an IRS bus
transmission in a bug or early bus that bolts right in and the hockey
stick is just like stock.  The catch is that it is expensive and also
requires a bunch of other transmission parts depending on which IRS bus
transmission you are using.  I think you have to use Berg's 643
as a front mount.  This setup bolts to the bottom of the intermediate
housing then welds on the outside of the tranmission horns.
