Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Vs. Treffen

Volks have been known to tow their non operating buses to Jerome just  
to be there.

If you don't have a party hat, Jerome is not for you?

How many shows do you go to where the hosts restore/customize/or  
rehab an entire bus that is raffled off?

Picture a Classic weekend OCTO bus turn out but everyone is camping  
there for 2-3 days.

Imagine a drum circle going till 4 am.

Think about camping in a dirt/rock  mine slag pile.

How about more raffle prizes than you have ever seen before.

Visualize Col. Sanders in the back of a custom DC in a slow drag.

Attend a wedding ceremony in the back of a DC.

Think Terrible Two's.

Think about never going again, but going back every year.

It's one of those kind of events.

  YMMV,

Tom B.-no bongos

&gt; The fresh air of Jerome vs the smog of Orange County - no contest ;-)

&gt; Being &quot;On The Road&quot; - That's what it's all about :-)
