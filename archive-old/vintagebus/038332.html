Well, I can't say for sure that it is for splitties, but I recently got hold of several VW-original (read, color wiring diagrams) bay window service manuals and compared the latest of them with my Bentley reprint and it was exact...except that the image quality (even for the black and whites) was much better in the original.

&gt;    Bentley is an exact reprint of the Original VW manual, right...??

Thanks! Joe
