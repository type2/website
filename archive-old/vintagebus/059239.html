&gt;FYI, apparently those who purchased the adapter kit from Wolfgang went
&gt;with the Brazilian MC as there is a difference between it and the German
&gt;ATE version.  The German ATE MC I got wouldn't fit the through hole in
&gt;the aluminum spacer.

I ran into the same thing with a German master cylinder and the Wolfgang
spacer -- the nose of the MC is just a millimeter or two too big to fit
into the spacer.  I machined the spacer a bit with a file and a Dremel
to get the MC to fit.

Also, the rubber boot Wolfgang supplies is meant for the Brazilian MC.
It doesn't fit very well over the nose of the ATE MC, and the MC won't
fit in the spacer at all with the boot installed.  I checked the spacer
and the boot against a Brazilian cylinder at the FLAPS and everything
fit just fine.  I did put the boot on but it's not secured to the front
of the MC - maybe some RTV would help.
