&lt;&lt; An old timer once told me that the best way to revitalize rubber was to 
soak
 it in Coca Cola, not Pepsi, but Coke, there is some ingredients in Coke that
 will absorb in and soften the rubber back up, 15 years ago and before in my
 356 Porsche days we did this quite often with some of the obsolete rubber
 out of these vehicles and it worked, but with today's chemicals they put in
 soft drinks I can not vouch for it but it could be worth a try. &gt;&gt;

You know how that black, rubbery, grimey, stuff builds up on your windshield 
when you have your wipers on continuously? I personally use the stuff in the 
green bottle (20/10 I think it's called), but my Dad had always said that 
Coke was the best thing to use to wash it off, although I've never seen him 
do anything but drink one.
