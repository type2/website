Rough sand paper or abrasive?
Gibson\


Yeah, I had some super rough open garnet sand paper
&lt;250?&gt;. Scuffed the drums and broke the sheen off of
the shoes then cleaned the hell out of the drum with
brake cleaner and cotton rag. Then air dry &lt;no
compressor on property =( &gt;. Cleaned the shoes with
dry, clean cotton rag. Reassembled/adjusted in std
method.
Seemed to help to a limited degree but ran out of time
and was generally pissed at/burntout on all VWs at
that moment so I didn't redisassemble and go through
it all again.
Hopped in the F150 and had a good day.

Now over threat of death and Bobbetization I am taking
the family on a VW holiday. Safety first requires
doing the brakes to support the &quot;gotta always take it
whether you want to or not&quot; Puck and all of the
camping and baby EQ. &lt;sigh&gt;

Next step is the steering box, K&amp;L's... &lt;major $ sigh&gt;
VW = fix or replace daily...
