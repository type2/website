Subject: Backup lights on 67 deluxe

	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

Remember, I am new to this stuff:
I have been watching close at backup light configurations, and I have =
not seen this on anyone's yet. Is this a special setup, or am I just not =
finding anything similar.
I have this one in good condition, the other is busted. I have =
replacement brake lights, but the white backup light, is it unusual or =
just not used anymore?
