&gt; Hi Scott,
&gt; One of these days we will have to video our packing the panel 
&gt; for the 700+ 
&gt; mile Sacramento trip.  You probably would get a hernia from 
&gt; just watching!  


I took some friends on a 800 mile trip in my '60 Dcab recently. They laughed
themselves half to death when they saw what I was taking along ie.
everything! When I was finished packing the only tools left in my workshop
were for working wood and the only spares left on my property were still
attached to my '57.

Later 

Michael
