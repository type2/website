Subject: RE: [VB] emissions failure - advice?

It's a real bummer to be in an area so strict. Here in the Puget Sound
area it's strict enough for me. I ended up building one good as close to
factory 1600 for the 71 westy I owned, took it through a failing
emission test, and then taking it to the VW shop for a correct tune.
What they ended up doing was leaning out my 34 PICT 3  and then
everything just barely passed. They then suggested high octane fuel and
some 104 additive and it passed better. I got the bus to pass emissions,
pulled it out and put back the 1835. Put the 1600 into the 71 bug and
got it to pass and then pulled it and put back the 1776. Put the 1600
into the 72 bug and got it to pass and then put the 1904 back in. I then
put the 1600 back on the shelf after running it with some Mobile 1
synthetic to coat the metal.

I know, I'm bad, but they are going to just continue to toughen the laws
until none of our dubs can be driven on the road again unless we convert
to battery or propane!

now that i live in a stink-hole big city, the 70 needs to pass
emissions... and it didn't.
here are the results:


HC in PPM - high rpm  :    MAX  500   my bus - 60      at idle :  MAX
500  my bus 852

CO in %   -  high rpm    :  MAX  4.20  my bus  - .26    at idle :
MAX 5.5    my bus  .20


1679cc with schneider cam (roughly an engle 100) and 88s, new, stock
vac dizzy for 74 MT beetles, new brasol 30/31 (125 main, 135y
emulsion, 50 idle and pilot).

any phoenix listees w/ pointers would be appreciated.
