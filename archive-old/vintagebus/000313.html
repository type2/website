Today I was at Bed, Bath and Beyond in San Francisco when I had a splitty 
sighting.
You know those fold up indoor tents for kids?  There was one shaped like our 
favorite auto.  So cool it makes me want to go out and have kids.  The 
company is called &quot;Playhut&quot; and it retailed for $19.99.
