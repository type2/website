&gt; Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt; While browsing the archives I came across the following list of &quot;MX
&gt; codes&quot;, M-codes that VW forgot:
&gt; 
&gt; http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\vintagebus.oct231998\1

Gawd, that thing comes back to haunt me!

&gt; Some selections include...
&gt; 
&gt; MX-232 - Add mouse nests in headliner
&gt; MX-265 - Remove middle seat, hide it in back of random barn

We had a lot of fun with these, a compilation of just about every nasty
thing you could do to a bus!

&gt; With this in mind, I think a list of &quot;special tools that VW forgot&quot;
&gt; are in order.  I'll start...
&gt; 
&gt; VWX-001 - BFH (Big F(ine) Hammer)
&gt; VWX-002 - 5' cheater pipe (rear axle nuts, flywheel)
&gt; VWX-003 - Small wire brush for all electrical connections
&gt; VWX-004 - Magnet-on-a-stick (fishes spark plugs and tin screws out of
&gt;             shrouding)
&gt; VWX-005 - Mirror-on-a-stick
&gt; VWX-010 - German/English phrase book (for cussing at your Bus in its
&gt;             mother tounge)
&gt; VWX-012 - Stocking cap
&gt; VWX-014 - Socket set used as drifts to install bearings and seals
&gt; VWX-015 - J-bolt with threaded end filed square in lieu of church key
&gt;             (my Bus came with this)
&gt; VWX-018 - Rag for front window defrost assist
&gt; VWX-024 - 24&quot; monkey wrench (alternative to VWX-002) (inspired by Walt)

OK, I'll play:

VWX-050 - Blue Wrench (gas torch)
VWX-051 - Friend with good hearing (for setting timing without lights or
instruments)
VWX-052 - Rope, used for securing stuff to roof rack, pulling bus out of
sand, etc.
VWX-053 - Shovel
VWX-054 - Friend with small hands (for retrieving objects that fall into
the cracks)


Now  you're responsible for compiling these for posterity!

George Lyle
