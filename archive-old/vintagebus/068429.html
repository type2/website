Subject: Re: [VB] Stuck drum

Doug,

Let's see where to begin.....Here's a list of what I tried when my LR drum was stuck...

1.  Tried a 10&quot; 2 arm puller...over several days.  
Generous amounts of wd-40, liquid wrench, penertrant, lubricant....you name it..nothin
2.  Tried a 12&quot; 3 arm puller, broke the sumbitch on the 2nd try.
3.  Tried a combo of the 12&quot; puller's center with a contraption of arms from both.  Had a much better reach.
Heat, ice, sprays, even a Bob Hoover write up found online regarding an makeshift ez-bake oven (foil, box, light bulb) to no avail....end result=nothin
4.  Oh yeah...all this time driving around with the axle nut backed off with the cotter pin in place.
Total mileage with nut backed off = approx. 2700 miles.
5.  tried a few other pullers...some heavier duty than mine.
All were basically the 2 or 3 arm type jaw puller.  Nothing
6.  Finally borrowed an old school heavy duty drum puller, threads into the lugnut holes.  Still took some persuasion and some beating with a BFH....but that sumbitch came off!


Save yourself some time and find the proper puller.  
And don't forget to grease them damn axle splines when replacing the drum.

&gt; My rear right drum is stuck on the splines.  I have a puller on it right
&gt; now, and it hasn't budged.
