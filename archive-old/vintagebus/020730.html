Subject: Re: [VB] Paint codes!

The last few cars I've painted I used PPG CLV.  It's 
very forgiving, not horrendously expensive - but not cheap -
and very durable.

A base/clear system gives a wetter look, but painting a bus
is a PITA enough without doing it twice!  You also almost
double your materials cost.

&gt; Last week I asked about paint codes
&gt; &amp; the pro's &amp; con's of two stage systems vs.
&gt; other method. Thom responded with code L31
&gt; and mentioned the system he has used with good
&gt; success. a single stage system.
&gt; What are the name's or types of products you
&gt; mentioned? I lost the e-mail with the info.
