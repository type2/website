Subject: Re: Reduction Box Bolt Question
Date: Thu, 20 Aug 1998 22:46:17 PDT



&gt;I then ran a tap into the holes and threaded the new bolts in.  Since I 
was
&gt;doing one at a time, I didn't have to deal with the spring plate and it 
sure
&gt;was wonderful being able to thread those bolts in by hand.  The new 
bolts
&gt;are about 1/4&quot; longer than the old ones, but after running in the tap 
to
&gt;clear the rust at the bottom of the hole, the longer bolts had no 
problem
&gt;bottoming out.
&gt;
&gt;Now the question, I believe I remember someone (Clara?) saying to 
grease the
&gt;bolts when I put them in.  I was wondering what the preferred grease 
is.  I
&gt;am planning on using the silver anti-sieze stuff unless someone 
recommends
&gt;otherwise.
&gt;

Sounds good to me! Good for you to get your Bus ready for the road.
I like to grease my bolts too. I like to use lithium grease because I 
have it on hand. But I like to buy lock washers too. The kind with a 
grip, you know, not a split washer, but a &quot;notched&quot; washer. This works 
for me.
Anyone else?
Jason
