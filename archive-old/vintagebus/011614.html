An anonymous &quot;Newbie&quot; wrote to me:

&quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you for your understanding of newbie-ness.  I
still consider myself a newbie after a year on this list, and almost 3
years
of bus ownership....and I have to say I am AFRAID, yes afraid, to post
questions to the list for fear of being ridiculed or told to buy a Toyota,
not
only by Hoover, but by several others.  I have resorted to hunting down
Clara
online and asking her my &quot;dumb newbie&quot; questions that I could not find
answers
to in the archives or on web sites.  She graciously offers advice, and
never
once has she told me where to stick it or flamed me for being an &quot;insane&quot;
VW
driving young &gt;&gt;person&lt;&lt;.  If only the list could all be like her.  The
last few
questions I have posted have either gotten NO response, or responses that
really didn't answer my question but managed to make me feel retarded for
asking in the first place.  If people like myself are the future of
bus-dom,
isn't it wise to educate us to the ways of the all-knowing elders instead
of
telling us we are not bus worthy?  I think so, and I'm glad to see that at
least one of the &quot;non-newbie&quot; crowd does as well.  Thanks again.&quot;
____________
I think this &quot;Newbie&quot; summed things up pretty well.   What...is that
Clara's halo swelling up really big?

Have a great weekend all...and hug a &quot;Newbie&quot;!
