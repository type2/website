Mr. Hoover doesn't need defending, but I get irritated when someone
takes offense with a message conveyed via pmail, then decides to air
their complaint to a public forum.

There's an old saying about engineers that goes:

&quot;The worst thing about engineers is that, in times of stress, they
tend to blurt out the truth.&quot;

I have a feeling that that is exactly what Bob did.  If his
correspondent wanted soft, diplomatic words, then he should have sent
his pmail to a car salesman.  They'd have told him anything he wanted
to hear.

Bob, I hope that you will continue to interact with us as you have in
the past.  Don't let the whines of a few thin-skinned individuals
discourage you.

George Lyle
