&gt; Going to OKC from Chicago this weekend. I'm leaving early Saturday morning,
&gt; staying in Springfield, MO. overnight and then heading to OKC in the
&gt; morning. Pickup bus drive to St. Louis , sleep, drive home early Monday. I'm
&gt; doing it this way since I'm taking my family with. Wife and two kids on the
&gt; road. It's gonna be fun. I don't want to kill myself driving 800 miles each
&gt; way non-stop. I've done it before, never again. Anybody on the way want to
&gt; wave or say hello? drop me a line!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to everybody that supported me and kind of pushed me to make this
&gt; trip. There was time when my car was stolen when I didn't want to do
&gt; anything. Small chat, a few warm e-mails make a difference.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Andre
