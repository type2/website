there is a huge difference in handles from the early 60s to and thru the 70s
on the SO 42.  The 60s handles are very squared box style handles that look
like small black boxes with one side open and a push button.  It is
important to get the right side handle to here as the opened side of the box
varies from front cabinets to the back ones and the door under the bed.  The
later 68 and on handles are a single formed piece that basically looks like
a normal door pull, one handle fits all sides.  They also changed color on
these from cream to black or the other way from the early years to the
later.  My 72 had cream handles.  Hope this helps.

&gt; The ones they donated to the Jerome raffles were exactly the same as what
is
&gt; in the SO-42 buses I have seen. If there is a difference, I must not be AR
&gt; enough to realize it. In fact, after having beans and broccoli for dinner
&gt; last night, I would bet there are several people who would back me up on
&gt; that. (So to speak)

&gt; &gt; I believe they have a mis-print in the year listing. Those are bay
window
&gt; &gt; style handles, not 67 and back. Instead of 58-79 it should say
68-79......
