Subject: Westy Tent Poles

Last week I sent a message out about how I was looking to find a Westy tent
(pre 64) In doing so I received allot of emails inquiring if I wanted to
sell the tilt or the 62-63 middle seat I have for trading. At this time I am
only offering them as trading material.

Anyway I may have found a tent minus the poles. Does anyone have a set of
poles for the large tent that would be willing to part with? I have cash
and/or parts to deal with.
Thanks again for everyone's help,
Shawn
