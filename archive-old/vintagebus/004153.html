List:

For anyone who is into wild fabric for aloha shirts or whatever, I noticed
some fabric at  Wal-Mart that has what are pretty obviously VW
buses...unfortunately for some people, it also has peace signs and other
hippie type references, and is a wild green color...but of course that
didn't stop me, as the wilder the fabric for my aloha shirts, the happier I
am.... also, am very happy so far with the stainless steel German muffler
for my '73 that I got from Bus Depot...went on fairly easily and no rust
yet.

Later,
