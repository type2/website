I don't see a difference between buying a bus in California and shipping it
to the midwest or east coast. Or buying a bus in California and shipping it
to England, South Africa, Japan or anywhere else.
In either scenario there's a bus enthusiast waiting to receive a much
anticipated collectible vehicle and give it a good home.
But the situation that started this whole thread has made me wonder a little
bit.
After all who gives a sh*t what someone who sends &quot;anonymous&quot; emails thinks
anyway??
