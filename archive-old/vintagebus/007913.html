&gt; Next year a guy brought some fireworks and was almost beat up for
&gt; it.


Fireworks are not allowed at the Jerome Jamboree. They are illegal in
Arizona. The Gold King Mine is located on land leased from a still active
mine. The Phelps Dodge Corporation, which owns the entire mountain, has an
explosives magazine located somewhere thereabouts and they will tolerate no
pyrotechnical displays. They can and will remove all of us, including Don
and his livelihood from their mountain immediately and permanently. They
nearly did last year after some peabrains ignored repeated warnings to stop
firing bottle rockets. The screaming big cheese from Phelps Dodge and the
Sheriff with him made it perfectly clear last year. There will be no
fireworks. Hard to get happy after having your ass chewed for something that
you have been trying to stop someone else from doing.

I'm starting to sound like a Mommy.
