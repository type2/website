Subject: CR9710 Seal for bus steering box
Date: Fri, 7 Apr 2000 09:00:17 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just got back from referencing this number at my 2 FLAPS.  Autozone
couldn't find it - all their computers say is NLA.  The other store -
Champion Auto are pretty awesome.  They don't always have the best prices
but they are a smaller, local chain but they've got the &quot;smart&quot; guys.  They
measure seals, reference all kinds of stuff with &quot;guess and by golly&quot;
reckoning and usually can help me out.  They were having trouble with this
number/seal tonight but they're going to call one of their sources and get
me the seal.  I was wondering though - since it's such a pain to order
these, is there anyone that can get ahold of one for me?  Sometimes this
local FLAPS takes awhile to get parts in so if there is anyone out there
with an output shaft seal for a bus steering box, I'd appreciate having a
chance to buy it off from you.  I'm going to need this seal very shortly (as
in the middle of next week at the latest) so I'm willing to pay for 2nd day
priority though the post office to get it.  How about it P &amp; C - are you
able to help?

Later!
