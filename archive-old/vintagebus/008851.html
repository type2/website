Subject: Re: [VB] More M-code help??

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My guess would be 388 would a combination of sorts - similar to some of the
US combos that included sealed beam headlights, overrider bumpers, dual
filament taillights, etc..

Which brings about a good question - Did Canada get Euro spec Buses,
US-style Buses, or somewhere in between?

Also, &quot;KA&quot; is the delivery port - &quot;K&quot;=Canada but where is &quot;A&quot;?  I don't have
that in my listing.
