Hi Charles,
Always a good idea to clean your carb when you do not know when it was last 
done.  The reasons for it dripping after being shut off are several.
1.  The mechanical fuel pump push rod is set too high.
2.  If you are running an electric fuel pump you need a pressure regulator or 
if you have it need to set at a lower pressure.
4.  The one way valves in the mechanical fuel pump are bad.
3.  Your shutoff valve in the carb resevoir chamber is bad, loose, missing, 
or missing it's gasket.
4.  The float in the carb resevoir is too heavy, leaks or is incorrectly 
installed.
