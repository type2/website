Subject: Newer Beetle speedo in early bus?

Would it be possible to use a later speedo in an early bus?

Like this:

The big question is really on calibration and if it will come close to 
indicating the right speeds.  I think the &quot;idiot&quot; lights and all the other 
stuff will hook right up no problem.  And the sizing for the hole is close 
if not the same as well.

Since I really do plan on being able to go 100 MPH I would like to have a 
good means of showing it if I ever go that fast :)  Granted I cannot imagine 
over 80 would be a common thing, if ever.

Thanks,
Adrian
