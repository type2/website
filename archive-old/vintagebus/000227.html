 I have a couple of questions for you know-all-do-all gurus out there. :-)
 
 First off, I need to get a gas tank with a sending unit for my 66 bus.  If I
 get a baywindow tank, I'm going to have to modify the filler neck I've been
 told.  Can I simply cut the next off of my old tank or on the bay window
 tank and use a piece of rubber tubing (like on the bugs) to hold the filler
 tubes together where they need to be?

sounds about right, I had a 59 truck with a 15 gallon bay window tank in it.  
 The guage read a little funny (6V gas guage)   But it had the filler neck 
from the bay window in there, but, as you mention, with a piece of big ol 
hose with clamps.
 
 Next is a wiring question:  Back by the starter, I have an ignition wire
 which I think presses onto the electrical male spade connector found on the
 relay (is this correct?)  Then there is stud with a nut on it on the back of
 the relay/bendix.  I have a battery cable with a round connector and then a
 red/black striped wire and solid red wire leading to another round ring
 connector.  Do both of these bolt onto the relay on the starter?
  &gt;&gt;
the battery connection etc with the round connectors do attach teh back of 
the solonois on the threaded bit (13mm nut)  ye sthe red wire (from igniotion 
switch) plugs on to the spade terminal
