Subject: Re: [VB] tragedy in NYC

Realizing that there are several hundred members on this list it isn't
appropriate on a *normal* day to share your thoughts and feelings about
things not VW related.  These however, are not normal days...hopefully.
There is more to life than busses.


&gt; I know this will offend some, but I don't believe this list is the place
to
&gt; discuss this stuff. In light of the tragedy, I know a certain amount of
&gt; dialog will happen....but can't we try to keep it bus related on this
&gt; mailing list? Just my opinion. Thom?
