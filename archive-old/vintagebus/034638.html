&lt;&lt; wouldnt this be the same as any doghouse front tin from a be*tle or super 
 71-79?  If so, its not 1 year only, but from an 8 year spread of type1's.
 (and one year of t2's) &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
1971 doghouse front engine tin piece is one year only.  By then VW had 
changed the front engine compartment shape possibly for the type 4 engine 
which came out in 1972.  Eric&amp;Barb
