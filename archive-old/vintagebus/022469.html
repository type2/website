Subject: '55 Westy Work
Mime-Version: 1.0


Spent all day sunday trying to remove the passenger side axle nut on the
'55; tried heat, cold, invectives, even used a couple tires to hold the
impact wrench on for ~20 minutes, nothing worked.  Finally just cut it off
with a die grinder, at which point the drum mercifullt slid right off to
the ground.  The driver's side had come off like butter, but that's because
the wheel seal had gone, and it was all nice and greasy!

The driver's side reduction box bearings were the worst I'd ever seen or
heard of.  The bearing was in pieces - even the little rollers were ground
up.  The gears are pristine though - go figure!

The bearing cover plate is toast - it's all wallowed out - anyone have
big-nut bearing covers laying around?

Well, I have my work cut out for me on this bus!  No spare time to spray
paint my name on chain link fences or anything!
