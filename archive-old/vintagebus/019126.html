I come to you with my hat in my hand...

I screwed something up in the first version of the
bentley campaign script.  The first few people signed
up fine, then I broke something, and nobody else was
able to sign up.  I was looking yesterday to see how
many people had weighed in an thought &quot;That's strange -
only 4 people?&quot;  So I did a quick test, and of
course, it didn't work.  It was a quick fix, but anyone
who tried to sign on from January 27th to February 4th 
didn't get saved.  That's what I get for trying to work
on the bus and on the web at the exact same time; I'd 
lay down some weld, and while it cooled, I'd slam out code.

So, if you'd signed the petition between 1/27 and 2/4,
could you please re-visit the page and sign on again?
If you haven't yet, this is the perfect opportunity to
do so.  The whole of the bus community will benefit!
