Subject: FW: [VB] Turn indicator

Could it be a.  the flasher relay is bad or wrong
or b. the turnsignal switch is bad?  Or possibly c. somthing I haven't 
thought of?


Make sure the lights are well grounded.  I had a similar problem, and it
was fixed by adding a separate ground wire to the turn signal lights.
