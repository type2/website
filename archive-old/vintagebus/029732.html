A little while someone mentioned they had a big bore 40hp in their Bus.
 Or maybe I saw it on a for sale ad somewhere.  Who knows, anything over
a week old is all a blur to me.

Anyway, I was wondering what that means - &quot;Big Bore 40hp&quot;.  40hp engine
bored out to a 1500 or something?

Let me know, maybe I'll build a 1600 disguised as a bastard engine or something.
