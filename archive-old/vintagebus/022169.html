&gt;What determines the year model of your bus? Production date? chassis date?

There are a lot of misunderstandings about model years of VWs throughout 
the years.  One reason for this is most books from the UK on changes in 
buses refer to calendar year, not model year.

Another representation is that up to a certain point the model year was 
the same as the calendar year, then it changed so the model year coincided 
with the annual shutdown of the VW factory.  This is also not true.

The model year change over date varied from year to year with the exception 
it remaining fairly constant from 1965-67.

For example, I have official VW documentation that supports that bus 
production for the 1959 model year began in November 1, 1958 with 
chassis # 404 491.  The same documentation states that the 1960 bus
model year began in September 30, 1959 with chassis # 514 885.

I am working on an article for NEATO's Old Bus Review with a timeline of 
major changes over the years that will be published later this year.

In working on information to go on the NEATO website, I have input the 
monthly production figures from 1954-67.  You can take a peek at it at: 

http://168.28.187.41/neato/techdata/chassis.htm

but I have not gone through it to format it to make it &quot;pretty&quot; yet...
Note that those numbers are for production calculated at the end of 
each month, and the calendar year is not necessarily the model year.

I hope to work with Jim Bryant who is in charge of the Old Bus Registry 
to also get an article in Old Bus Review this year regarding the dates 
for the change over dates for the model years.
