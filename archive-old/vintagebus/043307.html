yeah, me too, I scored 52%
&gt; 
&gt; one question:
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming you own a VW, do you insist on washing it once a week? 
&gt; ...once a day? 
&gt; ...more than once a day? 
&gt; Would you rather wash and wax your VW than go to a party? 

Wash?????  dirt protects the metal from rust

&gt; i mean, i'd drag a basket case vw 400 miles, and i've driven 1200 miles to
&gt; buy a transmission, but i think i may have washed my vw once... i think...

well not 1200 miles but pretty near

Drive the bugger, all mine were daily drivers,
today I drive a 78 FI AT and my ONLY vehicle...20,000+ miles last year!
