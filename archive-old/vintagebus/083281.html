I don't have numbers, but you can measure engine bay vacuum VERY easily with a
length of clear aquarium airline tubing and a glass of water while driving
down the road. The amount of vacuum can be an incredible amount. Do it
yourself and you'll see. The more you eliminate engine bay vacuum, the lower
your head temps go.

No, I don't just go by temperature numbers alone. You can accomplish a lot
more if you figure out the &quot;why&quot;.

  Do you have numbers to support the choking air supply/ pressurisation
theory?  Looking merely at the results of a change on head temp does not
actually show the mechanism of the cooling.
