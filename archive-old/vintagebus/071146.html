Subject: looking for Randy Long

Hi All,

 

Anyone know how to get a hold of Randy Long. the guy that makes the wood
slats?  I want some made out of Gaboon Ebony or some other similar
exotic black wood. for the double cab.. And with the correct blunt
forward ended long strips and double ended slant shorter pieces.  I'm
thinking the black ebony would look nice against all those chromed
original screws I have. :-)   It will also keep my color count down on
the dc as well (blue, black, gray, and chrome).

 

TIA

 

David
