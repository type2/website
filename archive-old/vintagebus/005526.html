Hi,

I will assume that you are talking about the engine mount
bolt that is behind the fan housing. I can crawl underneath
with my 17mm craftsman and rest the open end or the 12 point
end (its been a really long time) over the nut, then slowly
turn the bolt from the other side until the wrench contacts
something that stops it from turning. Then give the engine
bolt a good push to loosen.

Good luck,
Chris

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; Well, I finally for a functional splint on my finger from
my cleaning
&gt; accident (sshh, don't read that to loud ;0)  I decided to
go work on the
&gt; '66.  Changed the oil, tune up and all the great things
you folks wrote
&gt; me to do. I made sure the engine turned freely after 22
years of
&gt; sitting. All ready to go, I put the key in and CLICK,
nothing.
&gt; I climb under the bus to the starter. Use the old screw
driver, nothing
&gt; just a spark.  Hmmm.. same problem I had with the westy in
December.  I
&gt; got a new 6 volt starter and was planning to put it in
today.  We are in
&gt; the middle f exams and I have nothing to do today.  Wife's
at work with
&gt; the new baby, Casey is at school, The DAY IS MINE!  I laid
out all the
&gt; tools and climbed under the splittie and admired the solid
under
&gt; carriage.  Ok , let's get this done I said to myself..
Undid the first
&gt; nut after soaking it with rust stuff.  That was easy, now
to the engine
&gt; compartment.  So far so good.  Then it happened.  The bolt
kept spinning
&gt; with the nut. No problem, it has happened before on the
old '60 panel.
&gt; Well after fighting to get a wrench on the head of the
bolt for and hour
&gt; going through the innards of the bus, I am about to have a
fit.  Anyone
&gt; have any tips just how to do this?  Thanks
&gt;
