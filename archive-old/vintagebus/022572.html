Subject: Repro Popout Frames - worse than I thought...
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990717110420.00b1eeb0_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

On a tip from another listmember, I went out and tried to install one of
these popout frames on the bus.  I took the better of the two.

First off, the mounting holes don't line up with the holes for the hinge.
I could get the first one on no problem, of course.  The second and third
were progressively tighter, the 4th went in at an angle, and there's no way
in hell the 5th would ever go in unless I drilled a new hole.

For kicks, I grabbed a couple of really ratty frames that I had.  They line
up perfectly, even though they're from a bus that was made years after mine.  

Then I set a ratty frame inside the window opening next to the repop frame.
 More surprises (well, they're not really surprises at this point...)  The
radii of the corners is a) not the same as the factory ones, but also b)
not consistent within the 4 corners of the repop frame.  Imaging the
factory frame as a racetrack; following the line of the repop, you'd be
cutting thru the infield, running over spectators, at every turn.

It's sad that they went thru all the expense of tooling up to make these,
only to have them come out so crappy.  I'm sure it's not that much more to
have spent a little more time to make them *right* - it surely must cost
the same to stamp a correct one as it does to stamp a POS like these.  I
didn't know these were made by Wolfgang when I originally bought them, but
the quality is consistent with other stuff I've purchased of theirs, like
their safaris.  If these trivial parts are so inaccurate and shoddy, would
you really want to trust your life to their suspension and brake components?
