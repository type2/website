&lt;&lt; I do have a shift  knob with the pattern in it--But i think it is type 
I--supposed to be rare? PLMK, uj &gt;&gt;

I have one of these as well.  They are hard to find.  I have only seen a few 
originals.  They have been reproduced.  The reproductions are somewhat beige 
in color when compared to the original which is a light ivory.  The repros 
also have some defects in the casting...not sure if that was to make it look 
old or not.  If you are interested you can find them in the ads old Foreign 
Car Guides.
