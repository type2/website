Ok, what is the scoop with regards to the full flow pumps/filter adapter.   Is a
replacement oil pump cover tapped for lines to a filter sufficient?  Or should I
get the adapter that has the pump built into it.  Seems that with just the
replacement cover, only a small amount of oil will actually go through the filter
by luck.

&gt; A filter of any sort is a really good idea.  You probably read Bob Hoover's
&gt; reply already.  I can't add to what he already said, but there's a few options
&gt; to consider as to what kind of filter and where to put it.  By far, the best is
&gt; a full flow filter.  This filters all your oil.  The next best is a remote
&gt; cooler/filter setup.  I came across Bob's recommended oil cooler/filter setup in
&gt; the Sermons while they were still available online.  Basically a diverter plate
&gt; from where the stock oil cooler lives, lines through the fan shroud to the left
&gt; side of the engine room through a filter to a cooler assembly.  It doesn't
&gt; filter all your oil all the time, just when the oil's reached operating
&gt; temperature and has been diverted through the cooler.  The cooler system is
&gt; quite efficient, and the filter is mounted on the left side engine room pillar.
&gt; I haven't bothered calculating thermal efficiencies or anything fancy like that
&gt; but I have noticed a 50 degree drop in my oil temps.  The filter is easily
&gt; accessible, and the system adds almost a quart to the amount of oil a complete
&gt; oil/filter change takes (additional oil capacity).
