Subject: Re: [VB] New WCM &quot;Felts&quot;???

Not sure what the deal is with those.  I ordered a full set of felts from
Ronnie about 4 months ago and they were felt-covered rubber, pre-cut to
size and with notches for the window latches already cut.  I'm not sure who
Ronnie's supplier is, but they are the good ones.

&gt;i just ordered some WCM &quot;felt channels&quot; for the front door 
&gt;windows, and they are drastically different than the ones i've got in the 
&gt;past. first of all, it came as one solid roll that you have to cut yourself, 
&gt;rather than the 6 pieces listed in the catalog. not a real big deal to 
&gt;me.
&gt;
&gt;the strange thing is that there is NO FELT on the rubber!! 
&gt;yes, there is a very thin layer of some kind of material on the rubber, but 
&gt;that's what the old ones look like after 40 years!
&gt;
&gt;i called WCM, and a guy supposedly went to the warehouse 
&gt;to look, and said they were indeed &quot;fuzzy&quot; textured. i called the shop i
ordered 
&gt;them from, and they said the other sets they had in stock were NOT 
&gt;&quot;fuzzy&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;has anyone else received the non &quot;fuzzy&quot; type from WCM? i 
&gt;want to (and am going to, regardless) return them, but if i keep getting
the non 
&gt;&quot;fuzzy&quot; type, why bother? i'll have more i shipping than they cost!
&gt;
&gt;anyone purchased them from Wolfsburg West lately? are they 
&gt;&quot;fuzzy&quot;?
