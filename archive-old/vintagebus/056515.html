&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My efforts to find a &quot;pristine&quot; single cab split truck had gone nowhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good news today! A guy told me about a deluxe sitting in a home garage
in
&gt; &gt; North Carolina just 15 miles from here! I went to look and it is
&gt; beautiful.
&gt; &gt; Her Chinese grandparents bought the bus to drive to the market in
&gt; Asheville
&gt; &gt; for supplies for their restaurant. When the suppliers started delivering
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the early 1970's, the bus was parked inside. There is no rust on this
&gt; thing
&gt; &gt; as it has been in the garage since then. It has faded a bit but not bad
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; original paint. It might be older as she showed me a thingy to stick in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; rear to hand start the motor? Never seen that before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I wonder where I need to make the cut to make it a single cab. I
&gt; &gt; might take it a little back and make a double cab &quot;binz&quot; whatever that
is.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; will need to cut some plywood just right to seal up the rear. Looks like
&gt; &gt; those upper windows might get in the way of the cutting. Any ideas about
&gt; &gt; what type of caulk to apply to the wood for a good seal?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For $400.00, I cannot go wrong. I should be able to get some
measurements
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; EveryBus but really want to start cutting! Please help with advice or
send
&gt; &gt; pictures. I have never seen a &quot;real&quot; single cab around here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanx!
