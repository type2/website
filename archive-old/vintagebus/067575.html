Subject: RE: [VB] Steering box Pitman arm removal was Re: hellos

You might remember about 4 months ago I replaced my drag link that I got from
Bus Boys (shameless plug) on my 67 SC. At that time I had pulled the pitman
arm off with a 6&quot; gear puller and when I replaced pitman arm on the steering
box's splined shaft I had spun the steering wheel a couple of inches one way
or the other and now my wheel is crooked when I am driving straight. At that
time I got an e-mail from Eric &amp; Barb telling me that my steering would be not
as far one direction as it would be the other. Of course they were right and I
have since corrected the error.

Hi George,
The bus steering wheel shaft except for veeery early Barndoor buses are
tapered fitted and a single woodruff key instead of splines.  So there is not
way to adjust just the steering wheel to the shaft it mounts on in 1953ish
thru 1967 buses.  We thinks George has been playing with too many type 1s
which always have had splined steering wheel shafts!  ;-)
