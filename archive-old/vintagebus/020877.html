Subject: Re: [VB] SANDING paint

&gt; I had my bus sodablasted and it works great, although
&gt; they must use sand on any of the rusty areas.  Soda
&gt; stripping removes the paint without etching the metal.
&gt;  They blast baking soda at high pressure and the soda
&gt; explodes when it hits the surface, taking the paint
&gt; with it.  It will not harm chrome trim or rubber
&gt; however.  The City of Chicago has a fleet of trucks
&gt; with soda blasters to remove grafitti because it
&gt; removes paint without damaging the bricks of
&gt; buildings.

Gee, when the acid rain hits, Chicago will get awfully foamy, don't you think?

Soda blasting works well, but you still have to clean things very well before painting.  The soda powder will sit in just about every nook and 
cranny, and if it gets wet it will cake like cement.
