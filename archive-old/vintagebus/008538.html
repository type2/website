hey,
     I have a 1641cc that i want to sell, do u know anyone who needs one? I
was going to put it into my bus but i got offered
alot when i was in the process of restoring it. But the new owner didn't
want the motor.(due to the fact that he wanted to invest into a 2 liter.)
The engine is completely rebuilt, everything is new on the engine except the
cam, and the crank. it has new d/p heads and p/c kits on it. But this is
only the long block though.

                 please help me sell it if possible, i am a canadiam eh!
that needs money fast. If you know any one that is looking for an engine you
or they can contact me at vento_92_at_yahoo_dot_com or (604)812-1478cell or
(604)515-9754home.
                                                               thanx dude,
martin
                                                 ps i forgot to mention how
much i am asking $$1000cdn, and i am willing to pay for the shipping
(depending on where to.)
