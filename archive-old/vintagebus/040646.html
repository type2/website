Just a quick note that we will be closed the 24th.  UPS is not picking up on
the Christmas Eve (although they are delivering), so there's not a lot of
point in being open if we can't ship anything anyway. We'll re-open at 11 AM
on Monday to help you spend your leftover Christmas money.  :-)

UPS is delivering on the 24th, and US Mail is delivering Priority Mail on
both the 24th and (at the discretion of the local post office) Christmas day
as well.  To the best of my knowledge, we did ship everything that we knew
to be, or appeared to be, a Christmas gift order on time to reach you by
Christmas (other than isolated backordered items), *assuming* that they are
delivered on schedule by the postal service or UPS. Of course that's a big
&quot;if&quot;, since delays do happen this time of year which are out of our control.

Thanks, and have a very safe and joyous holiday!
