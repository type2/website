&lt;&lt; So - can anyone tell me whether a shift rod bushing for 60 bus is 
available!
 I have a couple that are part number 111 701 259 A and on page H-9 2 in the
 bently manual it says that those bushings can be  service installed in
 vehicles from chassis no. 631071 but I am 585 578 so .............. it won't
 work.  And my flaps says an earlier bushing is not available.  Anyone have
 any ideas?
 
 TIA

the part number you mentioned is the from shift rod bushing- goes around the 
front shift rod through the circular hole in the bit the front shift stick 
bolts to, and is for your bus ( through chassis 216  028 111)

the rear two bushings are the badminton birdies, and they were changed at 
chassis 835 088.  the older version are smooth on the outside, the newer 
version have a ridge-  the rear shift rod was changed at that time and no 
they are not interchangable.

so you having 585 xxx, you need the earlier type,  have not physically 
compared them (I have the old ones from my 61 still, as I had found some NOS 
ones for it)   so not sure about using the new kind in the old kind.  Also no 
clue on parts sources as I had picked up my shift bushings 2 years or more 
before I got around to installing them-   I could reach for my WW catalog, 
but so could you  :)

oh- the front one you can use if you change the bit the shift stick bolts to- 
the early ones have a metal tang and no plastic bushing.  sometimes the metal 
tang squeaks irritatingly, perhaps can be missing altogether.  think the 
thing that would need to be change is reproed, is the same part used on bugs, 
pn 111 701 263, cost 5 or 10 bucks new.

the change when they introduced the plastic bushing instead of the metal 
spring tab was at ch 631 071, you may still have this installed
