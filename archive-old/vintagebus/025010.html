&gt; was writ:
&gt;
&gt;   Evreyone that I've talked to or seen advertised sells
&gt;      rebuilt transaxles without nose cones, axles, and redux boxes.  The
&gt;      reason I'm looking for a rebuilt unit is that I believe my fulcrum
&gt;      plates are worn and are the reason I'm getting loud metal clankin

  I purchased an entire rebuilt rear end (trans,axles,red. boxes)from Rancho
performance 2 yrs. ago,if thats what you're looking for.there # is  714-680-6737.

  good luck,  woody
