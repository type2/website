Subject: Re: [VB] switched to dual carbs = lower mpg

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I recently put a set of Solex 35mm dual carbs on my 1600 motor.  I like
&gt; the results (more power, better power curve) but I seem to have lost
&gt; mpg.  I was running 20-24 for my single 34-pict, now I am down to 16-19.
&gt; Is this normal? &amp; how do I tune things for better mpg's? These carbs
&gt; only appear to have an idle jet mixture screw.  I don't know what size
&gt; main jets they come with but do I need to swap jets or something?


Yes, dual carbs are capable of better mileage than a single carb.

But you have to spend time jetting them correctly to get them dialed in
right. No carburetor is going to be jetted &quot;right&quot; right out of the box.
