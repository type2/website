Subject: Re: LED idiot lights?

&gt; I made a red prototype by unsoldering the glass bulb
&gt; from its brass base and soldering the LED in its place.

Some places sell lamps like this already made up - a
cluster of LEDs and a voltage-drop resistor in a standard
incandescent base.  I don't think I've ever seen one in
the base type that fits VW warning lights, though.  Plus
it's more fun to make it yourself.  :)

&gt; Then I added a voltage drop resistor by soldering a pair
&gt; of spade connectors onto a 330 ohm resistor so that it
&gt; connects between the bulb holder and wiring harness.

Assuming that the resistance to ground in the alternator
or voltage regulator when the light is on is zero ohms,
330 ohms might be a little low.  A red LED will drop
around 2 V, plus or minus.  During cranking, the system
voltage may be as low as 9 V, so this resistor would put
about (9-2)/330 or 21 mA through the LED.  If things are
right, the alternator can be putting out up to 15 V, so
this resistor will put (15-2)/330 or 39 mA through the
LED.  A 390 ohm resistor would be better - this would
make the current range from 18 mA to 33 mA - or even a
470 ohm resistor, which would put 15 mA to 28 mA through
the LED.

The actual values will be a little bit lower than this,
because the regulator/alternator probably isn't 0 V to
ground when the idiot light is on.  To know for sure,
reinstall the incandescent bulb, turn on the key, and
measure the voltage between the blue wire on the back of
the idiot light and ground when the light is on.  Add
this voltage to the LED voltage when you're figuring out
the dropping resistor.  For instance, if you measure 0.5 V
this way, and you want to put 20 mA through the LED at
full system voltage, you'd figure (15-(2+0.5))/0.02 or
625 ohms; the next highest standard value is 680 ohms,
which would give you 18 mA.

You'll also probably want to use something more than the
common 1/4 W resistor.  Out of these examples, your 330
ohm resistor at 15 V system voltage will be dissipating
about 0.51 W.  A 470 ohm resistor at 15 V system voltage
will dissipate about 0.36 W.  Usually you use a resistor
with at least twice the power rating of what you're going
to dissipate, so this says you need a 1 W resistor,
minimum.  I'd use a 2 W or better just to be on the safe
side.  Also, the higher-power resistors tend to have
thicker leads, which will help them to survive longer in
a vehicle. 

&gt; But my question to the electronic gurus on the list is
&gt; this; if I'm running an alternator and replace the
&gt; charge idiot light (2W/12V = ~167mA) with an LED
&gt; (&lt;20 mA), is this going to be enough current to
&gt; 'start' the field windings in the alternator?

I don't know, but as has been observed, you can parallel
the LED with another resistor to bring up the current.
Many American cars (and maybe even some later VWs) are
set up this way, even with an incandescent idiot light -
with the resistor in place, the alternator will still
work even if the bulb burns out.

If the alternator is zero ohms to ground when the light
is on, and the system voltage is 12 V, a 72 ohm resistor
will put 167 mA into it.  Since the LED will be
contributing about 20 mA, you could go up to around
80 ohms.  If the regulator/alternator drops a little
voltage, you can go lower on this resistor.  From above,
if the regulator/alternator drops 0.5 V, and the system
voltage is 12 V, you could run a 69 ohm resistor if you
ignore the LED current or a 78 ohm resistor if you
include the LED current.  Since this resistor will be
dissipating as much as the bulb would have, it needs to
be rated at much greater than 2 W, like 5 W or 10 W.

You don't need to consider the really low-voltage case
like 9 V when you're figuring out this second resistor,
because you don't care if the alternator works or not
while the Bus is cranking.  You do want it to start
working as soon as possible when the Bus is running,
and 12.0 V might be a good system voltage if you've just
released the key from &quot;start&quot; to &quot;run&quot;.  If you want to
be really sure, design for 11 V or so.

All of these resistors will get a little warm in operation,
so you probably don't want to just zip-tie them to the
wiring harness.  One way would be to get a small generic
circuit board from Rat Shock and solder the resistors to
that, then add some short stranded wires with push-ons on
them.  This will also help the resistors withstand the
vibration a little better.  Another way would be to buy
a fuse holder for 0.25&quot;x1.25&quot; glass fuses that has push-
on terminals at Rat Shock or the FLAPS, and then solder
the resistors in where the fuse would usually go.

What you want to end up with is a circuit like this (view
in a fixed-width font):

15---*------80 ohms---------*---blue wire to alternator
     |                      |
     +---&gt;|------470 ohms---+
         LED

15 is the hot-in-run circuit.  The LED and the 470 ohm
resistor can switch places if it's more convenient, but
I think the way it's shown above will be easier due to
the way the bulb socket is wired.  The actual resistor
values will depend on what you decide, but the higher-
value resistor should be in series with the LED and the
lower-value one should be in parallel.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds

PS: Since the LED is a diode junction, it may be knocked
out by an electromagnetic pulse.  This is only important
if you want your Bus to still run after a nuclear bomb
goes off.
