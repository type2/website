Thursday Thrills;
Just got back from a VW club meeting in Phoenix--Some one just bought a
new AM/FM, Cassette radio at Radio Shack for $50 for their bus!! He said
it fits right inside the hole for the stock VW radio NO Cutting
Needed!!! The knobs are closer together and that eliminates and surgery
on your dash.  He said it looks great!!! Will also fit a Bug!! Mind you
i have NOT seen this set up--Just thought i would pass it along--And
they are supposed to be on sale now for less than $50!! Happy
Hunting!!!  TWWM ,uncle jerry
