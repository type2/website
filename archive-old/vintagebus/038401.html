Subject: Transaxle - small nut axle, split case, type 1 center section

Ok,

I'm STILL trying to sort out the tranny differences.  Here is what I think I
have figured out...  This is a quiz, can someone confirm the answers?

Small Nut / Large Nut has NOTHING to do with Transmission!  Although people
say &quot;small nut tranny&quot; they are really talking about the Axles / Reduction
boxes.   --- Correct?

The center section is the &quot;split case&quot; part -- Correct?  Is the change from
&quot;split case&quot; to &quot;tunnel&quot; the same as the Reduction box change?  Or am I
confused on center sections (yes) ?

Small Nut is '63 and down, Large Nut is '64 - '67.  Small nut has smaller
brakes and uses 1.39 ratio reduction boxes.  Large nut has 1.26 ratio.

You can put the center section of a '64 - '67 on a '63 and down?  What the
heck is the difference, if any?

There are differences in how the front (FIF) of the tranny mounts to the
body and connects to the shifter linkage?  Can anyone summarize these
differences (relative to year to year)?

===============

I have a '63 that needs the center section replaced.  I'm locating a core to
have rebuilt and then put in, I just want to know what I should be looking
for in a core.  Can I use any year from '67 on back, or do I need to stick
to a '63 and down center section?

Todd Hill (Olympia Washington) and I have been going over options to raise
the top speed for long trips.  I'd like to be able to cruise 65MPH for
hundreds of miles...

Todd described how he could sell me a tranny where he takes various gears
and parts from various center sections and arrives at what he describes as
____&quot; a Type 1 center section with a 3.875 and a .82 4th set up for Redux
box Bus &quot;____.

It wasn't until I went over this again this morning that I caught that he
was saying a &quot;type 1 center section&quot;.  Does that mean I should not really
worry about locating a correct core for a center section, it just comes down
the $ to work out on core charge with purchase?
