How about drive it?

I own a toyota 4x4 v-6 for hauling heavy stuff and pulling splitties off
the highway. I'd rather have a nice small-block v-8 splitty.
You have the best of both worlds: You have a weird goofy rig that will
go like hell and was free, and you can tell any purists that you didn't
do it.
