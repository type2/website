Actually it's VERY handy for detail work in small areas, where you 
care about what the result looks like.  For example, I use it for
final trimming of panels to be welded, with good results.

Oh, and I have 2 die grinders with 3&quot; wheels, one is an IR with a built
in guard, the other a cheepie without.  And other die grinder with a
while wheel, so I don't have to keep swapping the heads out!
