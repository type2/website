Subject: $99,000 Westy

 As Ronnie posted it did sell at auction for $99,000. There is a story and
picture of it in Autoweek mag. this week. It's a 1966 A42 hardtop Westy. Biege
with 22,000 miles. Has roof rack and side step. Called the cleanest most OG
Westy in the country. Had two people wanting it, one on phone and in person.
Autoweek did say they thought it would sell for around $50,000 and were real
surprised by the high selling price. Should be a bunch of Westys at next
Barret Jackson.
