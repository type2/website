No kidding it's long!  600 lines of post just because you're mad that
this fellow doesn't immediately understand your needs and then gets a bit
annoyed when you pull out your flamethrower.

My mother once told me that &quot;it's easier to catch flies with honey than
with vinegar&quot;.  I don't think that the vinegar approach worked very
well for you here.
