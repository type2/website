Y'know, that seems to be a very arbitrary division.  Why a '67 bus and not
a '68?  Both vehicle share most of the same design details and differ
only in the cosmetics of the body and a few running gear improvements
(which '67-down folks seem to love to incorporate into their buses)  The
line is even thinner between '67 and '68 bugs.

If you're going to create a rift, why not pick an important change, such
as a change from rear engine/drive to front engine/drive?  A Rabbit is
obviously different from a Bug and a Eurovan is different from a Vanagon.
