Subject: Re: 67 turn signal switch (TSS)

&gt;[Euro tail lights] These have TWO bulbs not 1 like US. The second bulb is
&gt;for the Brake light only.

Actually, the second bulb is for brake and tail light - it's a dual-filament
bulb just like the sole bulb in a US-spec tail light.

&gt;I have no RT turn signal and suspect the TSS. It works with the four way
&gt;flasher so its not a ground somewhere I don't think.

From that description it may well be in the turn signal switch.  If you
follow the steps under &quot;troubleshooting&quot; at
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html it should tell you
for sure.

If you decide it is in the switch, you can try a shot of electrical
contact cleaner (NOT WD-40 or penetrating oil!) in the turn signal
switch.  Shoot it in down along the stalk, or take it off the column
and hose down the &quot;guts&quot; with it.  Work the lever back and forth
several times.  This may or may not fix it, but if it works, it's
cheaper and less hassle than a new switch.

Good luck!
