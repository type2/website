&gt;No question on this end.  6 April 65.  The May date may have been the
&gt;day it left the plant and was shipped.  My '67 plate says 22 June, but
&gt;the birth certificate says 24 June.  It was picked up by the original
&gt;owner at Wolfsburg.
&gt;
 Actually, the production numbers match an early MAY manufacture, not
April. So the plate IS wrong.

Siftung said the chassis was started on 5/5/65, and was shipped out on
5/11/65. M. Moore's bus was the clincher; it was built 10 days and 3700-odd
frames BEFORE mine.

What we need to interview folks from the plant is stuff like - mebbe VW
ASSIGNED a plate # to a chassis not yet built, which went to a seperate
line for trucks.  Im serious about that - if you live in Europe, or speak
German, the old guys who RAN the shop floor need to be interviewd!!That is
the only way to resolve goofy stuff like this. Ya know, like finding out VW
used parts in a bin till they ran out, no matter that 'officially' the new
part should've been put on.
Vintage Nazis, I see a new horizon opening for you :)
&quot;I NEED a bezel for a tail light, 6/12/62 at 2PM, not the one from 3pm!&quot;
