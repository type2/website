thanks for the info, I'll look for tall tires and keep toiling on the engine. 
 The steering box (coincidence?) needs rebuilding or at least some serious 
adjusting and all four brakes are leaky so a lot of money and patience will 
go into this beast before I give up the Baywindow.  Perhaps by the time I 
finish I will have achieved oneness with my new bus.  I believe in Zen 
driving and have truly become in tune with my 70 Westy.  If I can achieve 
this state with the Micro then all should be fine.  Wish me luck on my new 
course.

  Keep us posted on the 1776 to stock tranny situation.  I already have 
problems with the current engine and will probably look for a rebuild or just 
start over in the near future.
