&lt;&lt; Hi everyone! I just picked up a pretty basic, complete and original red 62 
 Kombi for 400 bucks and plan on restoring it and had some questions. The 
body 
 is pretty decent, no bondo or freaky hippy craftsmanship hackjobs. I noticed 
 some pretty serious rust on the lower cargo doors both inside and out. Which 
 other year doors are compatible with my Bus? I know where I can get a pair 
of 
 67 doors but they dont look like the exact same as mine.&gt;&gt;
Hi Alan,
What is your chassi number?  Never totally believe the paperwork for the 
model year of your VW.  If is is from 1961- very early 1963 model production 
it should be between chassi number 705 620 up to 1 019 924 for the correct 
doors.
  
&lt;&gt;
That is normal for Kombis.

&lt;&lt;It also needs brakes all around, I noticed some of the prices for these 
parts are pretty high. Is it possible to use 64-70 cylinders and shoes 
without alot of modification or destroying the backing plates at all? I want 
to restore this wonderful Bus so that I can drive it  next year and get rid 
of my New Beetle (bleh) and get back to my vintage Vws.&gt;&gt;
If you really plan to daily drive this bus and since you are just starting 
out in this area it would be best to install 1964-67 suspension in it 
instead.  The RGBs are a little higher geared, and the brakes are 20% bigger 
which make them feel more like 50%!  Also check out the freeway flier tranny 
info in the archives.  It really has helped us get great MPG, engine 
longevity, and the ability to keep up with 60+MPH freeway traffic.  Also 
check out the dual circuit master cylinder conversion we have in the type2 
library.  Which will double your chances of being able to stop if some part 
of the brakes fail!
 
&lt;&lt;Lastly, can anyone recommend a good manual for restoring a Split Bus? Is 
there one that gives details of body construction and bodywork?&gt;&gt;
Best is the Bentley reprint of the original shop manual.  Pricey due to huge 
info stored in there!   Eric&amp;Barb
