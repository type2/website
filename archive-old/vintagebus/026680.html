&gt; it art, and really stir up a hornets nest (which I would love to do.)

NQ,
After posting my response to you, last night I caught a show on one of the PBS
stations where they showed a place called CARHENGE.  The guy took a bunch of old
50's and 60's detroit iron and made a duplicate of Stonehenge.  The local govt
got up into a tizzy and said that he had an illegal junk yard.  The art
establishment came to his rescue and said no way, don't you recognize art when
you see it.  He and the art community won.

Now he did have the fact that it was on acres of property and out in the
boondocks working in his favor.  But if you were to figure out a way to be
really artistic....

Scott
