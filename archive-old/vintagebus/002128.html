Hello List
We are trying to locate some good used but useable pop out window frames for
our 66 deluxe that we are in process of trying to revive after it has been
parked about 17 years.....what a chore it's been.....loving every minute of
it.(grin) almost.
Anyway if anyone knows of some please e-mail us at
sunbuggy_at_mounet_dot_com

Thanks
Ira
