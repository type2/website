&gt; Hello,
&gt; If anyone could tell me where I can get wheel cylinder rebuild kits for
&gt; my 62 bus, it would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; I've tried Busdepot, Wolfsburg West, Rocky Mountain, West Coast Metric,
&gt; and someone at BFY Obsolete Parts is looking around for me as they did
&gt; not have them either.
Issaiah,

I did a lot fo research on this, and finally came to the conclusion that
the same front rebuild kits fit all busses from 55-70.

Busdepot has them, as should everyone else.  Going rate is $4.00 or so a
piece, but a friend has said they can be had for less than $2 given some
shopping.

If you need em quick like, napa has them for $7.00

take care,

Steve

p.s. replace all the rubber hoses too, they are almost guranteed to be
bad.  Its pointless to rebuild the brake cylinders without replacing the
rubber lines IMHO..
