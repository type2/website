 I have been monitoring the Windshield install thread with great interest 
 since it added a couple of tricks I hadn't known and will certainly use next 
 time around.  However, anyone care to comment on doing this with a corner 
 windows for a 15 or 21 window?  Given the cost of the corners I am loath to 
 even try these without some foreknowledge.... hints/thoughts/experiences ?

I am just commenting with my lack of ever having done the corner windows.   
Although I have a couple extra, one of the ones in my 61 is cracked (pitted 
gravel road in boonies, beautiful lake though!)  and I am scared to break 
them too.  Mine are laminated, sigla.   I have a sekurit one, less breakable, 
things will flex even.  but I would like to hav ethe glass right.  My seals 
are old and cracked and surely not too watertight.   though my safari does 
resist rain quite well, only a little leak today, near the left side latch.
