Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel pump rebuild seal ?

Thanks for the tips guys!

I ended up using Permatex Hylomer gasket sealant.  It is supposed to be gas
friendly.

I lubed up the gasket and retried the gas line.  Works great!  So far at
least.

I have heard good things about Hylomer and I found it to be good as well, I
might try it for case sealant down the road.  (that or Yamabond)

More to come with the Porsche pulley results once we fire her back up and go
for a drive.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow

Hey Adrian,

Use the permatex. I have a similar pump, all original exept for the 8mm head
screw. I had to tap the hole with a 10-32 thread and I used a allen head cap
screw. The permatex was the ticket for sealing. Not a drop of leakage yet.
(only a year and a half and 550 miles). It is gas proof where the RTV will
swell and soften from the fuel.

 I have 307,000 miles on that pump. I am going for 500K.

Chris
