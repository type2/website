Hi list (again)

Well, since I haven't seen my original post attempt to the list, I'm
going to give it another go.

vehicle: '64 Single cab

I have a small leak out the bottom of the fuel tank at the host 
connecter valve thingy.  You know, the one that you screw on to
the tank that holds the little piece of pipe the hose connects to.
Well, it's leaking and I think it's because the tiny gasket isn't
doing it's job.  So I'm looking for suggestions on how to remedy
this problem before I start the neiborhood on fire.

Thanks in advance,
