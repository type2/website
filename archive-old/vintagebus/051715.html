Subject: Re: [VB] Need for speed - limit


I remember when I sold my '55 westy; it went to one
of the Japanese bus traders.  They left my house after the
Sacramento bug-o-rama and headed to LA.  This bus had a 
well-worn but good-running 36hp engine, but no parking brake!
There wasn't enough compression to hold it on the modest hill 
that was my own drivewya, much less the Grapevine..

About 10PM the next evening, I got a call from the buyer, telling me
the bus had made it.  In his words: &quot;Bus run good, but by Bakersfield,
big hill, velly hard, VELLY, VELLY hard!  But we make it, bus run good!&quot;

It was all I could do to keep from laughing!
