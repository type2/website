Subject: Have you checked your wheel bearings lately?

I decided to adjust the brakes on my 65 westy during a break in the rain 
yesterday... so jacked up the front, and started with the rt wheel... the wheel 
wiggled.  huh?   both ways,   no not in the links/kings/steering.... the wheel 
bearing nuts were too loose.   I snugged them down, but probably should take 
the drum off and see if they are okay.   found my bag of front axle nut lock 
washers too.. hooray!

Anyway, the brakes are nice and tall now.   I can lay down rubber braking 
with just the hand brake   8)
