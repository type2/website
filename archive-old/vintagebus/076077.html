Subject: RE: [VB] Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

&gt;ps. One of my suppliers told me that they might stop making 009's, I doubt
&gt;it though being that they are coming back out with NEW 010 along with the
&gt;050 that are still available.

i have been told by a local vw part shop that they currently are NOT 
making 009s, as there are soooooo many out there now. supposedly 
temporary situation?

YMMV.
