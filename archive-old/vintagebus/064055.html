Subject: Re: [VB] gas tank divider plates and gaskets...

Hey david
the ones I call late are these (starting in 66)
http://dropgates_dot_com/y2y/tankcovers1.jpg
http://dropgates_dot_com/y2y/tankcovers2.jpg
Which also coincides with the parts books and are also the same as your 67.

the ones you call &quot;early&quot; are the same as the ones in my 57sc and my 58 binz

Im not sure about what the ones go to that you call &quot;late&quot;... 60-65
possibly?

And yes, the dividers used the same felt strap down material that the gas
tank used,  for the divider seal. I could take a picture of mine if you
want. I think the later ones changed to a rubber gasket.

&gt; Last night, I was going to install the gas tank divider plates even though
&gt; the last of 4 screws for the plates still have to go off to the chrome

&gt; found as a replacement for my one crusty one is that of a later bus.
Follow
&gt; the link below to a web page with a picture of the two.  So, I'm in search
&gt; of one divider panel which I would gladly pay for, trade for the later
&gt; divider panel, or accept as a charitable contribution (yea right :-) )
&gt;
&gt; Also, I noticed that my one crusty panel I have has remnants of a felt
&gt; material similar to that of the anti rattle strips that go between the gas
&gt; tank and hold down straps which makes me wonder if the correct gasket
&gt; material for these plates is a felt material or is a rubber gasket similar
&gt; to the fresh air vent cover.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know when these plates changed?  The 67 tipper has those of even a
&gt; different style as can be seen on the tipper web page in the picture
showing
&gt; the hydraulic pump.
