From a weight-distribution standpoint, you would be best off going with
them nose-to-nose. As noted, w/o a good trailer schematic it is tough to
armchair this one. I think some elbow grease and ingenuity will find you
loaded properly.

Sure, but not having the info on the trailer, I did not suggest that.
Wouldn't work with my neighbors flatbed trailer, the front of the truck
would smash into the tool boxes and railings up front.

&gt; &gt; 14 feet + 14 feet = 28 feet
&gt;
&gt; Hold on there pardn'r, it's about 12 feet from front
&gt; tire to rear of bus, and 12 feet from front of bus to
&gt; rear tire. Pull of the rear bumper of the front bus,
&gt; front bumper of the rear bus, butt them together and
&gt; let them overhang the trailer a bit and you could.
