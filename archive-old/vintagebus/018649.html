Isn't the market close to saturation already?  It seems there's only a handful of
actual suppliers for the actual parts (ie WCM, I(something, etc), and a multitude of places 
that re-sell them, like type2parts_dot_com, RMMW, WW, busdepot, aircooled_dot_net

On the flip side, the places that are reselling seem to be swamped, so maybe
there is room for another player.

Ya know what's needed?  More stateside distributors for Alan Schofield's stuff.
