Subject: Re: [VB] re: classic insurance

  I tried to explan the rat look and the dull paint is what I wanted. I then asked if they have a problem insuring 
primmered 50's style street rods and his answer was no!! So my agent is persuing every possable angle. Pollamns 
underwriters just has something against VW buses now. I guess they fiqured out that they do get driven a lot and 
Pollmans has no mileage  or really any other restrictions. You can drive to the store and/or work with their policy as 
long as it is not your primary means of transpo.

&gt;I have to ask. In the event of a wrech where this bus gets damaged, do
&gt;you think that the insurance will refuse a claim when they get to the
&gt;wreck site and find a bus (while mechanically sound) is now suddenly
&gt;VERY dull color?
