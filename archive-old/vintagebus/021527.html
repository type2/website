Hi Tim,
If your bus and it's tank are pre-1967 you might want to install either a 
1967 only tank or one from a 1968-71 tank (which will give you five more 
gallons to drive on).  Both of these type of tanks have the hump in the top 
to allow for the fuel to expand into a vapor when heated up from undergound 
temp to engine room temp.  With the hump in the tank the vapor takes quite a 
while longer to pressure up the tank as much as the earlier tanks and thusly 
does not push the liquid petrol out the gas cap with so much force.
  Also take a good look at your tank opening where the cap seals to.  Is it 
rusty or pocked marked.  Then it would be a good idea to polish the sealing 
surface there.  You can only use a vented cap or risk collasping your tank.  
Above all only fill your tank when you plan to drive at least 25 miles before 
parking.
