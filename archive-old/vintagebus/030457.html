Try checking out www.movecars_dot_com for a nationwide listing of auto
carriers' websites.  This site also contains some points to consider
when choosing a carrier.  Some of the linked websites will give online
estimates.  Note also:

1.  Some of these companies are only brokers, not truckers.  Using them,
your vehicle may pass through many hands (making progress difficult to
track) by the time it reaches you.  Which could take a couple of weeks,
all told.
2.  Covered transport is more expensive.  If you go uncovered, plan to
give your bus a good degreasing when it arrives (diesel soot).
3.  More risk on your part = less cost
3.  Based on my own experience of 2 years ago, I roughly estimate a
typical coast-to-coast shipping of a VW bus to be $1000 now.

&gt; I have purchased a bus currently sitting on the west coast(OR). Although I
&gt; really, really, really, want to drive her home, I might not be able to get
&gt; the days off until April, which would be better weatherwise anyway. IF I am
&gt; forced to have the bus moved (a 66 deluxe, standard roof), which companies
&gt; can the list recommend? I am primarily concerned with safe storage during
&gt; terminal transfers, if any, full insurance with no deductable, and no
&gt; damage, and a good price would be just great, too.
&gt; I expect two of us to fly out should we drive her, and about 350.00 in gas,
&gt; so transport might be cheaper, a small plus in being robbed of a coast to
&gt; coast drive.
