Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting finds

My friend McGill misunderstood my cry baby diatribe from Weds PM. Yes, it does
in deed get cold in Phoenix and yes it is, without joking, a different kind of
cold. My point was that I would prefer living in an environment that is at
least 20 degrees F cooler 12 months out of the year. Preservation of umpteenth
marriage and maintaining my Mom's house keeps me locked into the Central
Phoenix flight path. 

Given that Lotto hitting and an agreeable spouse &lt;or not&gt; I'd run up &quot;North&quot;
and buy a place called Westfalia Acres from a friend of mine.

Finding stuff in the nose of a bus? Yeah, like a weird bunch of stamps with
cartoons on them and a huge bag of seeds. &lt;seriously&gt; That's why I conduct what
I call a &quot;roach check&quot; on every vehicle that I buy. A 68 Chevelle that I bought
&lt;back in the day&gt; for $190. had over $300. in small bills under the carpet! =)
&quot;Chillin&quot; for now
