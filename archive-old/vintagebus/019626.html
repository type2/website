I've been using their high temp exhaust paint since I rebuilt my motor last year.  It only seems to last about a few months on some of the hottest places....starts to flake off.  That said, I did not sand blast the muffler before I painted it with the stuff.  I just touch it up every few months no big deal.  If I was doing a nice resto, I aluminize or hot coat it.

hello list,

I am thinking about placing another order for some POR-15.

My question is Should I get some of their POR-20 too? (I think that is what 
they call their exhaust paint)   I want to In order to coat my Heater boxes 
and exhaust.  The heater boxes are VW ones so I want them to last a while 
because everyone says the Dansk ones are crudy.

Secondaly
does anyone have a SVDA dizzy that they would part with or know where I 
could get one? I want to see how much of a difference it makes compared to 
my 009.

thanks
domonic
