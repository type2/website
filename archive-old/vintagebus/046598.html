&lt;&lt; Anyway the problem is there needs to be a square peg (I think) coming out 
of the

Hi Steve &amp; Rachelle,
If you are talking about the forward cargo door on the passenger side of the 
bus then you have a non-walk thru exterior panel van handle.  Either you need 
to get a non-panel handle or talk to Gabriel who runs a VW key buiness for 
the adapter piece he has created for these.  Eric&amp;Barb
