The K.C. Kombi's campout is also called &quot;Oktoberbus&quot; and will be held at the 
Indian Cave State Park located on the river bluffs overlooking the Missouri 
River in southeast Nebraska.  This will be the weekend of 
October 27,28, and 29th.  It's about a two hour drive north of Kansas City.  
Erin (No Quarter) and the Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas busers will 
all be 
there.  The KC Kombies along with a number of Nebraska bus folk are 
sponsoring this campout.  The campground has hiking, biking, caravan to local 
historic sites, plus all the usual camping fun and games.  Campground has a 
group use area with shade trees, picnic tables, fire rings for campfires, pit 
toilets next to campsite, but no electrical hookups.  There are offsite 
showers and water in the park.  For more information, call Pink Newell at 
(816) 587-2838 or email at pinknewell_at_aol_dot_com
