Hi Al,
Not quite!  There were at least two versions of this passenger side under tin 
used in 1300, 1500, and 1600.  The one piece that made it more of a pain to 
install/adjust the thermostat and the two piece that allowed the rear third 
of the tin to be removed to work on the thermostat.  If you used the latter 
make sure to used bolts to attach the two pieces together.  Engine tin screws 
which were stock there do not allow enough torque and loosen resulting in 
loss of this rear tin piece!   Eric&amp;Barb
