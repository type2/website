Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

About a year or so ago, one of the well-known NorCal bus shops tried
to sucker me into buying one, claiming it would fit just by using
a bay-window pitman arm, which I would have to dig up myself.  

The Bus Depot wrote:
&gt; but if you come across anyone who has steering boxes at
&gt; a cheap price that's probably what they have. Since Beck-Arnley has these
&gt; wrong ones, and they supply most of the full-line auto parts stores, you
&gt; should also beware of ordering one from your local FLAPS.
