Subject: Re: Seatbelts in a bus
References: &lt;199807100751.AAA17488_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

We have had more than a few customers who wanted us to install 3 point
seatbelts in their buses. We have also installed seat belts in the
middle and back seat areas of buses that were not designed them. I hope
we have added some safety to them and not just feeling of false
security!

&gt; &quot;IMHO this is a really bad idea. These pillars were never meant to
&gt; support this kind of attachment, and will not hold the force of a human
&gt; body being thrust against it in an accident.&quot;
&gt;
In 1968 the &quot;B&quot; pillar seems pretty much the same but lo and behold,
there are seat belts attached to them from the factory.

&gt; &quot;Better seatbelts in a splitty, by my thinking, is kinda like worrying
&gt; about the toilet overflowing in the house just downstream of the Hoover
&gt; damn.&quot;
&gt;
Huh?

&gt; &quot;If you are going to get carried away you could install later high-back
&gt; seats, a 5mph super-beetle front bumber, or, better yet, admit that you
&gt; are not a splitty person at heart and go buy the latest hunk of Detroit
&gt; steel.&quot;
&gt;
IMHO this seems a little extreme for &quot;friendly&quot; flame doesn't it. This
guy just wanted to feel a little more secure in his bus.
