Hi Weston,
It is if the oil is super cold, thick and/or super high RPMs.

&gt; I did put in a new sensor to see if I couldn't get lucky. No such luck.

Rats!


I'll try the rear pressure valve tonight. Would it be &gt; useful to pull the 
&gt; pressure gauge off the 81 camper and put it on here to see what the action 
&gt; might be?

It would be nice to know, but it looks bad either way.

&gt; I know the pump is somewhat difficult to remove. Can I do it on a thing 
&gt; without pulling the motor? If the pump is pulled, does that give you access 
&gt; to the
&gt; pickup tube should it be loose?

We never had much problem with removing the oil pump.  Though in the 
non-pre-1972 buses VWs you have to work around the rear apron!  You will need 
to remove the muffler and so require a muffler gasket kit for later 
reinstallation.  Most of all you will need a oil pump puller tool so you do 
not ruin the engine case prying on it and scarring any sealing surfaces.

&gt; Thanks,   Weston

BTW you most likely will have to rap with a hammer on the relief valve plugs 
three times each to work them loose of the corrosion sticking the threads of 
the plugs in place.  Then they should turn with a wide slot tip screwdriver 
easily.
You are welcome!
