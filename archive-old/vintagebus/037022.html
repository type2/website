a &quot;pop bottle effect&quot; has been mention- as in the idea of blowing more hot air
into a bus being like blowing into a pop bottle.


Alas, it isn't so (at least in mine)

my mom has a cute bug, 67, she's the 2nd owner, and with the windows wound up
it's hard to  shut the doors.  It would float I am sure.    The heat in my 59
truck is better at 30mph than at 45mph, as the &quot;paper bag with holes effect&quot;
fights the heat output.

In quest of the pop bottle bus- guess I better get some cab window seals in
the thing, and get the doors shutting and sealing well.

Has anyone had that  feeling of the door being easier to shut w/ window
cracked open in a bus, that happens in well sealed bugs?     The bus my ex
boyfriend had with the gas heater in it had good seals and minimal draft, but
no pop bottle effect or hard to shut doors w/closed windows effect, and he
made sure the doors etc all sealed well, very nice with stock heat.   

I remember some story of a bus floating till someone opened the cargo doors-
maybe they can seal that well.    I'd like it.

Clara
