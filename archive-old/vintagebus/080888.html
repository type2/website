Subject: Re: stuck motor?

&gt;
&gt;The motor was at TDC, and wouldn't go any further clockwise. I can rotate
&gt;almost all the way around counter clockwise -- maybe 350 degrees, but then
&gt;it &quot;thunks&quot; to a stop again. Then I can rotate it back around clockwise to
&gt;TDC, and get another &quot;Thunk&quot;, and it won't go any further. Any ideas as to
&gt;what could be the problem?

Take the plugs out and try it again (gently).  If you have a bunch of fluid
(water, gas, oil) in one of the cylinders, it can keep the engine from
moving - sometimes known as &quot;hydro lock&quot;.  Taking the plugs out will let
you get most of the fluid out, if that's the problem... then you have to
figure out where it was coming from.
