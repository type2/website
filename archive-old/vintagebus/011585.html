Thom,

My 54 single cab is missing the grease fitting that goes on the pedal shaft
for the pedal assembly (brakes, etc.).  Would you know where I can obtain
the grease fitting that fits this pedal shaft, so we can lubricate the
pedals?  

If you could, would you mind asking the vintage bus list if anyone has this
grease fitting, as I don't yet subscribe to the list in my new job.

thanks,

Charles
