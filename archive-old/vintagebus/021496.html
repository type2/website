  I had to do it I had to make that smart remark to my fellow club
members and it bit me in the butt.As they were getting ready to leave
the show they gave me a cell phone number, in case I had trouble. Me?
Have trouble? NEVER! I calmly handed them my cell phone number and told
them if they have trouble to call me. Well at least the trip there was
uneventful.    Folks who know me or have had the pleasure/horror of
travelling with me usually would describe me in one word, &quot;Lucky&quot;. There
are many documented stories of my unreasonable luck ask anyone who went
to everybus about the welded shifter story, or ask my close friends
about the sliding door splitty. I tell everyone I am not lucky, God is
in my passenger seat. But anyhoo the story must go on....
    The trip to Michigan was uneventful I drove all back roads and
enjoyed some Amish baked goods. The most exciting part of the trip up
was the road to the campsite. I swear they made that 4x4 truck
commercial, where the dually is bouncing through the mud, on the road to
the campsite. I got to the camp in time to caravan to the tailgate party
at VWoa HQ. I skipped the Bus dinner and cooked my own back at camp. I
met lots of cool people from the list and drank too much beer. sat was a
good day!
  The show was cool, however I did not get to walk around much since I
had a swap space. I was right across from Criss Huff and the infamous
great bus tour hubcap,that I was responsible for losing a while back.
Criss had the big tank of helium and was distributing the purple
balloons.(thanks!!) I sold enough junk to pay for the trip, but not
enough to be rich.
   After it was all over I packed and got out on I-75 southbound hooked
up with the Toledo contingent, two old bugs and a single cab. I ran with
them until I ran out of gas, the party was over, Coasted off the side of
the road and tried to figure out what happened. Earlier on sunday I had
some wiring problems so I Figured that was it. Now the bus would crank
again but still not start. Opened the engine lid Opps! forgot to put oil
cap back on at vwoa Checked and refilled oil. Now I look at the fuel
filter empty dang, start hoofing it.
   Back to the luck thing, did I mention that I am lucky? Anyway I
coasted right up to a exit when I ran out of fuel so it was a short
walk. I had at least two people returning from the show stop to offer
assistance. I also found my wiring problem and fixed it for good also I
noticed the oil cap before I toasted my motor. Optimistic folks can not
have bad luck!!
   After filling the bus ,filling my tummy, and a little nap, I was back
to work driving the bus home. Nothing else exciting happened except for
my 8-track bursting into flames at 55 mph in Acron Ohio. Not sure how to
look at that optimisticly but I'm sure I will find a bright side. I just
pulled the wires to it and the fire went out, I didn't even get a chance
to use my new fire-extinguisher(dang)!
       The moral(s) of this story is(are)
Let God ride shotgun with you.
Optimists seldom have bad luck.
Cary a fire-extinguisher, cause you don't ever know when your 8-track
player is gona bite the big one.

Oh yea I almost forgot...fix your gas gauge!
