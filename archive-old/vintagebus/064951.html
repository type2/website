&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 	Has anyone recently replaced the bushing/bearings of the pitman
&gt; &gt; arm? Also can it be done in the vehicle and is it hard to do?
&gt;
&gt; Those are the brass bushings for the swing lever, right?  I thought
&gt; those were a real bear to get out, but did it with the front axle on the
&gt; car.  I know I pounded it out with a hammer (it was several years back),

A gentler way to do it is to make a puller.  You need a piece of pipe a
bit larger than the ID of the bushings and longer than twice the height of
the bushings.  You need a socket whose OD is less then the OD of the
bushings and more than the ID of the bushings.  You need a piece of
all-thread that is just small enough to go through the socket and three
nuts to fit the all-thread.  Lastly, you need a big washer that is larger
than the pipe and with a center hole just bigger than the all-thread.

Pop the cover, remove the swing lever pin, and move the swing lever aside.
Put a nut on the end of the all-thread, put the all-thread through the
washer, through the pipe, and up through the bushings.  Run the all-thread
through the socket above the bushings and install the other two nuts
above the socket.  Use wrenches to jam the two nuts above the socket
together.

Now use a wrench to tighten the nut at the bottom of the all-thread.  This
pulls the socket through the beam, pushing the bushings ahead of it.  The
bushings pop out into the pipe and the whole works falls free.

A similar method can be used to install the new bushings after they are
reamed to fit.  Baywindow folks can skip the reaming as their bushings
come pre-reamed

Save the hammers for delicate engine work!  :)
