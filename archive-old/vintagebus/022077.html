Sorry for the cross-post, but the info I need could come from any of 
these lists.

I need to rebuild 2 early bus transaxles.  I have torn two down already 
and have a couple more to scavenge parts from.  The two I already tore 
down both had 4.375 ring &amp; pinions in them (1 Richmond splined and 1 
Klinkenburg keyed).

What I want to do is put a 4.125 in one tranny and a 3.875 in the other.  
They need to be 8 bolt ring gears and keyed pinions with nuts.

For the 4.125, I think I need to be looking for a 1960-1963 bus tranny, 
but do they have 6 or 8 bolt ring gears?

For the 3.875, what were the stock applications?  I think late model 
type 3's and Karmann Ghias had them, but I don't have literature on 
them to look the info up in.

So if anyone knows the stock applications for these ring &amp; pinions, I 
would appreciate it.  Beyond that, does anyone know vendors &amp; prices 
for new ones?  The only catalog I have that has them is the Berg 
catalog.

Dave
