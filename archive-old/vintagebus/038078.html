Hi Susan,
Which type of roof rack?  Westie, German or VOA rack to name just a small few!

&lt;&lt;  Also, a working Sapphire radio with mounting frame for a 1967 (the longer 
opening).  Complete, please.  &gt;&gt;

Sapphire III which was AM only or Sapphire IV which was FM and AM?  There 
were many other radios that the dealer would sell also!  You should check out 
the GuteFarht_dot_com websight for thier images of VW radios!

&lt;&lt;An emergency flasher switch for 12v. &gt;&gt;
Which part number or at least how many wires hooks up to it?  There 
apperently was a N. American market one and another Euro one that used many 
more wires.
