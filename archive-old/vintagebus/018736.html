IF you haveever looked at a Safari/Thing 181 the ones without exchangers
they have different cooling tin on the bottom of the motor.If you look at a
motor with exchangers the exchanger is part of the cooling tin.Most of the
vehicles for the Brazillian market had no heat.

A friend of mine has an 1986 Brazillian baywindow doublecab with a type1
motor,it is a deluxe model as it has heat along with a lot of other funky
stuff manual choke carb,ice pick rear door handle,air conditioning,frameless
pop out side windows and more
