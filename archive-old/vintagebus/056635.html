Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome '02 dates?

This has been a topic of discussion in the ABC for several years now.  The 
club could undoubtedly sell more tickets and make more money (for itself and 
for charity) but we can't really come up with simple (-minded) way to keep 
track of it all.  Add to that the possible complications of the winner not 
being present and the club having to deal with getting the bus to the winner, 
well, advance tickets have always been voted down in favor of &quot;must be 
present to win&quot;.  The closest to an exception to this that has ever happened 
was the guy who won the Hawaiian bus a few years ago: he could'nt make it and 
gave $20 to a friend who was coming.  That friend bought 40 tickets and put 
the other guy's name on them.  One of those was the winner and the person in 
attendance who was holding the tickets took the bus back to the Bay area to 
her friend.  Now that's a friend in deed!!!!

Anyway, the point is that thickets can only be purchased at the event.  If 
you know someone who is coming and you trust they very much, then that's the 
only way to get tickets without actually being there.  Sorry 'bout 
that........
