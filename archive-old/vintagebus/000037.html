&lt;&lt; Can anyone tell if bus exhausts differ internally from beetle ones? Can one
 weld up one of the holes in a beetle silencer and use it on a bus? &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
That is one question we have been wondering about but since VW did not 
produce just a block off for the bug to turn it into a bus it probably is not 
a good idea.  Which would have saved them the hassle of carrying two 
differant mufflers in each and every VW shop all over the world.  The only 
way to really tell would be to dissassemble a bug and bus muffler that was 
not too rusty to see.   Eric&amp;Barb
