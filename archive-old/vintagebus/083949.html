Subject: Looks like I got screwed-Now need dual carbs-will barter!

Hey Y'all,
I got screwed by a guy named Mark Clayton from Las
Vegas Nevada. We made a deal, I traded him a SW gas
heater for a set of stock dual carbs. I sent the
heater, he received it, and six weeks later I still
have no carbs and now I can't get any response from
this guy.  God, I hate getting screwed by someone who
is in the VW hobby. Oh well, I guess they can't all be
straight-up folks like us, right?! Anyway, I need a
good set of dual carbs and I am a little short on
cash, so I am looking to barter.  I have a 78 parts
bus that I can trade. It has no engine or tranny but
does have all glass, dash, brake booster, spare tire
mount (nose), seats, doors, electrical switches,
bumpers, etc.  I'll trade all of it or any part for a
good set of dual carbs. I dont need the intakes or the
linkage, just the carbs,  in working condition.  Also,
I have a set of 4 baywindow stock wheels (71 &amp; up)
with BRAND NEW tires on them, driven less than 10
miles (unfortunately the tires are not rated &quot;light
truck&quot; only passenger) but you can have them for a
good set of carbs, they'll just have to be picked up
as I cannot ship them.  I also have some miscellaneous
stuff: Cooling flaps and Thermostat set-up from a T1
engine. A used 34pict3 carb, dirty but works. Some
other bay window bus stuff too, just ask.  Anyway I am
just north of Cincinnati Ohio and I can ship any
smaller parts. Can anyone help a brother out???
PEACE! John Baker

Peace, John Baker
