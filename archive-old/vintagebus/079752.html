Subject: Re: [VB] engine troubleshooting help needed

&gt; Try replacing the fuel shut off float in the carb with another.  We had a bad
&gt; problem of fuel leaking out the throttle butterfly shaft ends after shut down
&gt; and turned out the otherwise fine looking float was just too heavy.  Did you
&gt; put in a gasket between the float needle valve and the carb top?  What jetting
&gt; are you running?  Could be too big of main jet and/or too small of air
&gt; correction jet.

or it could be the float valve itself. especially the ones that come in
the rebuild kits. &gt;
