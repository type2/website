I typically don't find &quot;way northern california&quot; and &quot;rust free&quot;
in the same sentence.

And I bet it's missing more than taillights.  Just a hunch.  This
thing may be the cat's pajamas for all I know, but I've chased down
enuf buses that were just missing &quot;one small piece&quot; to know that
usually the owners conventiently &quot;didn't know&quot; that buses had things
like door handles, aprons, engine lids, floors....

Before you do anything, get a good, clear, set of pix.  Not pix of it 
rammed in a barn, but all 6 sides, plus the insides.
