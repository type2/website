In early 1998 on one of those &quot;not-sure-if-its-spring-or-winter&quot; type of
days, I was in my 71 Westy and went to the local Arby's drive thru.  There
are 2 ways ways to go thru the drive-thru 1) The right way but more
difficult way (this is due to traffic always being in the way when you need
to turn yet you can't stop to turn as you risk getting rear ended - happens
all the time) and the 2) easy way where you come in thru another entrance
and actually weasel in thru an opening where there is no &quot;guide-curb.&quot;

So as I entered the parking lot, I saw there was nobody in line and as I
came up to the drive thru, the timing couldn't have been any more rotten -
some guy managed to go the &quot;right way&quot; and I just pulled in ahead of him.
He just &quot;knew&quot; that I had cut in front of him which wasn't case - had I
taken the &quot;right way&quot;, I would have still beaten him cuz I simply was there
first.

As I'm sitting there with my window down and his little woman sitting right
next to him, he hollers up to me something like, &quot;Thank you!,&quot; or &quot;I hope
your happy.&quot;  It really pissed me off and I looked at him wanting to say
something but decided not to.  His little &quot;honey&quot; was laughing so it was
evident that he was using me as in indirect way to show off to her.  &lt;SIGH&gt;

So I placed my order and as I drove up to the window, I told the gal, &quot;I'm
also paying for the gentlemen's meal behind me.&quot; - which I did.

As I left the drive-thru, I made the normal U-turn to get back on the
highway and the look from both the guy and his little honey as the
drive-thru operator was trying to tell them I paid for their meal, was worth
a million dollars - they were looking at me gawking trying to figure out who
the hell I was.  I continued on a few blocks to where I work and parked in
the parking lot, flipped down the table and started eating.  The show-off
and his little honey drove behind the bus just looking and wondering with
perplexed looks as if they thought they were supposed to know me (thank
goodness NO!) and then they drove off and to my knowledge, I've never seen
them again.

I think I tuned myself right then and there.
