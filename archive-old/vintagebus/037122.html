Im talking about taking &quot;saving&quot; a binx double cab rather then seeing it fall 
under the sawzall.
Yes, I was considering taking the one on ebay (so Im told is beyond repair) 
and grafting the parts into an earlier, more desirable truck.

&lt;&lt;Are you considering buying the ebay DC and then cutting out the cab and
then grafting it onto another pick up?  Or are we simply talking about a
