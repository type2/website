&gt; Thanks Jim,

&gt; I will have to give Sears a try. I tried to order GL4 from my local 
&gt; NAPA store (Los Alamitos, Ca), and they acted like I was speaking 
&gt; some foreign language. I also tried to order some zinc/epoxy primer 
&gt; from them with the same results. Hopefully Sears has the GL4 in stock.

You'll be able to find the zinc/epoxy primers at a body shop supply
house. They sell the stuff to the body shops. They will also sell it to
us.
