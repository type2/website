Subject: Re: [VB] Leaning Bus..

Justin,

You have a whole plethora of options here:

1.Take your ass to Jenny Craig or equivalent.
2.Take you're ol' lady to Jenny Craig or equivalent.
3.Find a fat chick to ride with you to lower the high side...may take some trial and error, to find a chick with the proper weight to lower the side evenly.

Anyhow......just do some obvious but maybe overlooked possible factors- same tire size? same rim size?

Is it lower on one whole side, front to back?  Or possibly more in the front or back?

How do the shocks look?  Who knows, what some DPO did in the past...

&gt; Hi, All!
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully this is not a silly question, but, I noticed that my bus is leaning 
&gt; to one side about an inch or so. I checked the tire pressures in all tires 
&gt; and they are right where they should be. Anything else I can look for? It is 
&gt; really starting to bother me, and I can't figure out the problem. :)
