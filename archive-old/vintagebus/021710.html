&lt;&lt; Since the achieve is down, I need to ask the list about my trouble 
 establishing an oil light on my speedo. I have a 67 Westy and the speedo as 
 many of you know has at the bottom (Left to right) red Gen. light, blue high 
 beam and a green oil light. All the lights work with the exception of the 
oil 
 light. At the top the speedo lights work but the turn indicators dont. I 
have 
 taken all lights out to verify that they are good. Filament is in there, 
 grounded well, scuff all connections. Ignition switch maybe faulty, not 
sure. 
 New oil sender in the rear. Checked with tester, no power going to sender. 
 How does this sender work? I should see the green light when I turn the key 
 right? All fuses are good. Can someone tell me what the lightbulb holder for 
 the oil light looks like. Does it have onle 1 coneection or does it have 2?  
 Need your help !
 I hate electrical!!!!

the light bulb holder for the oil light is a push in thing that goes into the 
speedo.  like the lights for the speedo at night.   Reach up under the dash 
to the speedo and feel the wires- find the one that pushes on where the oil 
light goes (helps if you have small hands), pull it back down and out.  AT 
the top end, not pulling the wire. There should be a  bulb holder with little 
bulb on there.

Can you get to THom's website with the colour wiring diagrams?

okay, lets start from the beginning, take the wire off the oil sender at the 
motor.  hold it againstthe engine case.   ignition on, does the oil light 
come on?  You may want a helper for this step. if it comes on, the problem is 
in you sender

you see, the light grounds through the sender.   There is a black wire which 
is attached at a push on connection by the bottom three lights of the speedo 
area (look at wiring diagram), this is hot w/ ignition on.   SO the power 
goes into the metal where the light bulb holder plugs in, into the light bulb 
holder, through the side of the light bulb, through teh filament, to the end 
of the light bulbsto the part of the bulb holder the wire goes on, into the 
wire, back to the engine, into the sneder, through the closed contacts on the 
sender and grounds on the motor.

When you turn the motor and the engine runs, the oil pressure pushes the 
contacts in the sender open, and the light goes out, or if the sender is bad 
from stuck open contacts, the light does not come on ever.   The early (screw 
terminal) switch can be adjusted for the amount of pressure it takes to open 
them, meaning you can have it so the light comes on at what 7 psi instead of 
at 4psi or whatever.  Anyway, if the light does not come on when you ground 
the wire at the sender you have a problem before the sender, plug the wire 
back to the sender.  ignition off

now pull the oil light bulb out of the speedo.  The wire to it is a kin of 
greeny bluey colour, striped I believe,  look at wiring diagram.     Pull the 
bulb holder off the wire.  Does the bulb hodler and bulb look okay?  
Sometimes the bulb holders fall apart.  Test it.  make sure the bulb and 
holder are good


the thing is they get power from the same wire as your gen light, so there 
should be power there. up front

you can also see if you have a problem in your wire from front to back,   
PLug the tested good bilb and holder back on the wire.  Take a jumper wire 
from the always hot fuse on your fuse box and attach it to the outside bit of 
the holder, this metal where it contacts when installed in the speedo 
housing.    Have your helper take the oil pressure sender wire off the sender 
and ground it against the engine case.   Light bulb should come on.

 usually it is not the case that that wire is bad, except sometimes right in 
the engine comparment.  Oil degrades plastic- the coating on the wires and 
they get brittle, see how the wires up front are nicer than in the engine 
compartment.

hope this helps.
