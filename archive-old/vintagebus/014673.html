Subject: OK, Figure this out for me

I have a problem that is a little wierd.  If anyone has some insite
please let me know.

All my rubber is new, completely around the bus.  My passenger door
closes tight.  My driver's side door closes tight but has just a little 
alignment problem in that it sticks out maybe 1/8&quot; from the body.

When it rains, the door will not stay shut.  It will seem like it is 
latched, but if I turn right it flies open.  A good bump and it's open.
If I slam it from the middle of the door, the toggle latch closes, but 
doesn't grab the post.  If I slam it from the back of the door, it 
seems to shut (it hasn't come open at least).

This doesn't happen when it isn't raining.  I can close the door with
normal pressure and it latches.

Anyone have an answer for this?
