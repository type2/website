I might have missed this. What year bus are your RGB, if they are large nut
you should not use the seals in the kits, they are the wrong size, even
though VW superceeded these and said the seals in the kits will work. On
large nut RGB I use the 113 501 315H seal, which I have in German and always
include these seals when I sell a seal kit for the Large Nut RGB. After
30,000 miles on my DD (with large nut RGB) I have never lost a seal.

Last night I finished putting my transaxle and RGBs
together.  Put gear lube in, did some other little
thins that needed some attention.  Went to bed
figuring I would do the box install tonight.
   On the list to day someone gives the advise to get
4 GRB gsk/seal kits cause the quality of the seals are
suspect.  I think that sounds a little odd.  So what
do I find when I get home.  Thats right gear lube
leaking onto the floor.  So off I go to the parts
store to get extra gsk/seal kits.

  PS Charlie said use condoms, can I get your phone
number cause my wife will never believe me!
