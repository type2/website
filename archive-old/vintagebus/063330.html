Subject: [friday] Judson kit for $135

Hey all!

My mom was visiting an antique shop and bought me a 1965 JC Whitney 
catalog.  Here's just some of the goodies I could have gotten for my
Bus when it was two years old.  Their &quot;VW&quot; section in this 218-page
catalog was 7 pages long.  These are all in 1965 prices; multiply
by 5.5 for 2002 prices (and then compare to what we're actually
paying).

Generator with regulator           $40
Starter with solenoid              $53
New 28PCI                          $19
    28PICT                         $25
Stock P&amp;Cs (4 sets)                $44
Distributor complete               $23 
Fuel pump                           $5.50
Muffler                             $9
Muffler install kit                 $2
Heater boxes (stale air)            $6.50
Wiper motor                         $3.50                      
5&quot;x7&quot; Bus mirrors - gray            $3.50
                    stainless       $5.50
6.40x15 tires, recapped            $10
  used                              $6
Spark plugs, AC or Autolite, new    $0.63 ea
  resistor, new                     $0.82 ea
  used, set of 4                    $0.75 / 4
(They have various &quot;trick&quot; spark plugs with anywhere from three to six
electrodes.  Nothing is new under the sun...)

Maybe I could make it go faster:

Judson supercharger kit for Bug   $135 
                            Ghia  $149
Big-bore P&amp;Cs (1351 cc for 40 hp)  $75

The specs they give on the Judson kit are:

0-50          20.0  10.2  17     9.5
0-60          30.5  15.5  28    13

Noise dB      55    55    55    55

I could avoid speeding tickets (in a Bus?) and have tunes, too:

Radar detector (beige, blue, or green)   $35
14-record changer (45 RPM)               $70
4-track stereo tape player              $100
  chrome                                $115
Tapes: half-hour                          $7
  one hour                               $11 
  two hour                               $18
Tachometers                              $30 - $42
Power inverters (12v-&gt;120v): 30 W         $9
  200 W                                  $45           
  275 W, frequency controlled           $133

If I had an American car, I could upgrade it with the latest features:

Add-on hazards       $6.50
Add-on turn signals  $9
DRL                  $3
PCV kits             $3 - $7

Plus the usual assortment of crap:

Hula girl doll               $0.75
&quot;Whitewall&quot; rings for tires  $4 - $6 
Sticker set for VW dash      $0.70
(das glimmerblinker, der drizzleflippen, das schmokegedunka,
 der puttersparken, die warmercougher)

They also liked to play both sides of new features.  They have a
whole page of seat belt retrofit kits, but on another page, they
have a &quot;tip-over switch&quot; that cuts the ignition once the car tips
more than 45 degrees, with copy like &quot;Don't get trapped in a flaming
auto!  New safety for seat belt users!  Strapped in may mean trapped
in!&quot;

The copy for some of the miracle gas-saver gadgets is really hilarious.
Some of these same gadgets are still being promoted and sold today and
still don't work.

Anyway, I thought this might be interesting for Friday.

Matt Roberds
