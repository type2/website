AAAOOOGAH!

(That's a siren going off - pet topic on which I'm actually willing
to try and stick my opinion down other people's throats detected).

Seat belts are a MUST (feelin STRONG today).  Think
of family and others if not youself.  And while they are required
by Australian law for all road registered vehicles I'd ALWAYS put
em in anyway....

It is possible to fit mounts without completely butchering your bus.......

go to http:www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty

click on the 'US 23 window' link in the left panel
and then look at 'fitting seat belt mounts'.

RobK

	&gt;Speaking of seat belts, does anybody know what the law reads on
them....(I
	&gt;live in Oregon).  If they weren't there to begin with does the
vehicle need
	&gt;them?  I'm all for safety but if you have to hack it up I'd rather
not.  And
	&gt;if they are mandatory, what is the best route?

	&gt;Thanks

	&gt;Dave
