Don, the buskatour host took some and sent them to me, but I can't open
them, here is his e-mail address. He has ton's of photo's of listys and the
weekends event, hopefully someone else can get them from him and figure out
how to open them up. Don Boneau [obonahan_at_home_dot_com]

Did the group photo of listmembers at OCTO ever get posted on the web?
