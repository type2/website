the freeway flier is another name for having a 3.875 rand p in there, rather than the stock options for splittys of 4.12 or 4.37.  this gives higher road speeds at the same rpms of the motor.

means yes higher speeds on flat, but unless youhave a fat motor it lose on the hills, even long slight uphills.   I have it in my westy and am not sure whether I like it or not
