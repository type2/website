Hi Volks,

I want to thank all of you who responded to my wife's plea for help.  My
folks were amazed at the number of calls and offers of help that you all
gave.  I just told them, that there are still good people in the world ;0)
I needed to get back to Virginia because I was starting summer school
meetings on Wednesday.  I wish I had the time to get Sparky running myself
but it was imperative that I get home.  i found a local shop calles The
Country Garage in Cape May.  The shop has been in business since '65 and
ther were 8-9 Loafs sitiing out front of the shop.  I felt pretty good that
I left Sparky in good hands.

Well, the final diagnoses was that the coil was overheating.  I think it
was Joe Fornier (if not I apologize to whomever) but he mentioned to
diconnect the tach.  Well, the shop got the bus running well by replacing
the coil but it still had problems.  They disconnected the tach and presto!
 I had a very nice 280 mile trip home with my two year old Casey yesterday.
 No problems and Sparky ran great.  Thanks again for all those who offered
there wisdom.  Now I will carry and extra coil, dizzy and points with me at
 all times.

Now, do you think the tach is bad or is there a better way to connect this
so it doesn't screw up the coil?

Thanks.
Joy thru air,

Jamie
