Subject: Looking for Al

I need some help finding a fellow bus person.  I met him at the last
SOTO event at WW.  His name is Al and he was parked along the back
fence.  He had the restored ambo step for sale....remember??  He told me
he would pick up some seat brackets for me.  I've not heard from him
since the event.

Does anyone have his e-mail or phone #?  He is a Pomona regular I think,
so someone must know him better than I obviously do.  Greg...you seem to
know everyone.  Any clues??

Thanks for any help.

Steve
