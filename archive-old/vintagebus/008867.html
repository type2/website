It was 2 years ago this month that our bus loving friend Josh Rodgers passed
away.  Although I never met him, I really enjoyed his emails and it pains me
to think of what might of been - the shows we might have attended, the
caravans we might have went on, and the fun we might have had at Little
Sahara.  I will always remember those pictures of his baywindow with the
stars 'n'  stripes painted on the sides and that photo that was taken of him
next to a junked out double cab found in a junkyard in Oklahoma (which a
listee now owns I believe.)  I thought it fitting that I should make mention
of him in remembrance.  He had a strong personality that eminated even
through his emails to me.  Maybe a few close friends of Josh would like to
tell a little story about him and share a few thoughts in remembrance for
this cool guy.
