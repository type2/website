&gt;Just a little worried about getting stuff ripped off in LA.  Is is safe
to park my bus there, my fron't doors don't lock and its not that secure
of a vehicle anyway?
&gt;
It's safe at the shows, although I wouldn't leave your camera on the front
seat or anything.

I personally keep my decklid locked because I've had people open it at shows
when I was not there.
