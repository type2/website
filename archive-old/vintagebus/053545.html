Subject: Re: [VB] Re: trailering a bus

You'll have to be careful how you load with a short trailer, you need to
have positive tongue weight (more weight on the tongue than on the back of
the trailer) or you'll have the most difficult time controling the trailer,
the trailer will try to control you.  I have seen many trailers &quot;fish
tailing&quot; down the road and this is the cause, not enough tongue weight.  If
the fish tailing get severe enough, you will loose the trailer and possibly
your tow vehicle as well.  Just a couple weeks ago I saw a huge Airstream
trailer upside down on the side of the road when the driver lost control of
the trailer, the tow vehicle stayed upright.

There is also a problem of too much tongue weight, your vehicle will &quot;buck&quot;
and make your trip very unpleasant.  You must find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; where
you have just enough tongue weight to make everything go smoothly.  To find
the sweet spot you may need to roll the bus forward or backward to adjust
the weight, with a short trailer, this is hard to do.


&gt;Thanks to the MANY encouraging responses and advice I have received from
&gt;all listees. The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning on using
&gt;(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope is long enough- has
&gt;someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport) trailer and can vouch
&gt;that the bus will actually fir on the trailer?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again everyone!!
&gt;
