Monday.....(seems like it was Friday all weekend....),

        Over this weekend, I had a chance to go up the road a couple
hundred miles to visit with one of the biggest Type2 gurus in my area.  He
has collected almost fifty buses including about every rare model you think
of.  Have you ever walked into a barn just full of early 21 and 23 window
deluxes?  It is kind of breath taking.  I took pix....I will share em soon.

        Anyhow....this is the guy that got the '67 Poptop Westy that was
going up for the &quot;supposedly worthless&quot; auction in Kansas City, KS about a
month ago.  FYI, he got it including the original side tent (1 to 10 scale
rating: -8-), Westy roof rack (-5-), Westy (optional?) side mirrors (-5-)
and all the interior (-7-) all for a little over $500.  It was a two-tone
orange from Pennsylvania in '75.  The engine was original '67 with governor
on it and &quot;grease pencilled&quot; in 15,000 miles in window.  Apparently, it had
gotten abandoned by its owner(s) on its way back to PA with a bum axle
bearing.  The cost of both axle bearings being replaced was the Westy's
ransom.  Rockers were history.  Gas heater was a plus.

        Some guys have all the luck!
