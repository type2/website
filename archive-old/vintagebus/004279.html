&gt;Something to check is, with the hubs off, watch the shoes while
&gt;someone else steps on the brake.  Do both shoes move, and if so, do
&gt;they move the same amount?  If not, I'd be very suspicious of bad
&gt;wheel cylinders, or possibly of the non-worn shoes hanging up on the
&gt;backing plate or at the fulcrum/hinge at the non-wheel-cylinder end.


You want to be real careful about pushing the brake pedal with the drum off.
Good way to get a face full of brake fluid when the wheel cylinder blows.
Nothing to limit the travel, you know. The angled wear on the shoes sounds
like the drum is in a bad way, assuming the brake shoes are flat against and
parallel with the backing plate. Do you have a way to measure the inside
diameter of the drum at both edges of the braking surface? Are you sure that
the springs are strong enough to return the brake shoes to rest when the
parking brake is released? If not, then even though you release the lever,
they can still be dragging which could lead to FUBAR'ed drums.
