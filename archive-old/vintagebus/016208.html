OK, Can't emphasize enough how serious I am about
selling this extremely nice 1954 bus. Have observed
several lesser buses selling all around me!
Advertisements on Excite and VW Planet will be updated
soon. Will be keeping the extra items and selling them
separately.

Will considering primering, lowering, installing a
warmed over 1600 and large nut tranny and adding rust
and body damage if it will make it more marketable.

$12,000 FIRM!
Price will not be reduced again. Its already $8k below
appraisal. I'd rather burn it and tell God that it
died.
