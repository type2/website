Some buses the front running lights stay on, and some they dont.    

the post barndoor light switch (off with eadlights) gets power at terminal 30.
when the switch is halfway out terminals 57&amp;58 gets power, which respectively 
power the front parking lights andthe taillights.- the running light wires go 
directly from the headlight switch.

with post barndoor  euro light switch (on with headlights), there is no 57, 
however, and 58 activates both fronta nd rear running lights.- the running 
light jump off the fusebox where the left tailight wires is to chassis no 614 
455 (6 fuse fuse box), and off the fuse box where the right taillight wire is 
from 614 456 (8 fuse fusebox)

on the barndoors with one fusebox, from Jan 54 (on with headlights) when your 
turn the head light switch to the left terminal 58 is actiavted, which turns 
on front and rear lights, and the two speedo lights.    when its is turned to 
the right, it turns on termnals 56 and 58, so in addition the  headlamps are 
on.  there is no term 57.

on the barndoors with two fuse boxes, before Jan 54,  (off with headlights) 
when the light switch goes to the left, terms 57 (front running lights) and 
58 (tailights and one speedo dash light on dash)
when the light switch is to the right, 56 activates (headlamps) 57 goes off 
(no front running lights) and 58 stays on.

I was surprised when Everett said he's stayed on, cause on my 53 they go off, 
so I looked at the wiring diagrams and it makes sense.

so I bet the guy with the 60 wher ethe stay on either has a euro switch, or 
the bus is miswired.

I believe this change happened in '62 or '63.  My '60 acts the same as
Everett's.
