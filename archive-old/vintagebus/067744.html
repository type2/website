Subject: Clutch cable tube replacement?

Steel tube that carries the cable has popped off the tack welds that hold
it to rear torsion housing and 1st crossmember forward of that.  Also had
hit a stone or something that flattened the tube just fwd of that.  I
sectioned it so I could replace the cable, and jury-rigged something to
hold the tube to the chassis, but ...

Has anyone replaced their tube with steel tubing from the hardware store?
