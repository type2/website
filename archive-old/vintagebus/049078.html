All:

I didn't quite expect the flood of emails, so I figured I should post the price on the list, which might reduce some of the interest.  I'm asking $1050.00 for the entire setup, which I think is fair based on current market prices, when these things even become available for sale.

A couple of other pieces of info that came up in some of the emails, which should be useful to anyone interested.  The rear hoop STILL has both of the rubber bumpers on it.  They are both solid and in great shape.  These are normally missing.  The very top of the canvas had a few very small holes beginning to form, so instead of them becoming big holes I had them patched and stitched from the inside.  They are only slightly visible if you're standing on a ladder so that you can even see the top.  Other than that there aren't any surprises.  This is a great tilt condsidering it's 40 years old.  It originally came from a VW dealer in South America, in case anyone is interested in it's history.  It has the trademark VW exterior red stitching and blue stitching on the inside of the canvas.  If your'e thinking about buying a tilt this is a good one to have.

Pmail me any other questions.  Thanks for the interest.

Robert
