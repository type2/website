When I worked in the automotive brake test lab we used denatured alcohol to
flush the lines on both the vehicles and dyno's.The process we used was
flush with the alcohol and let sit for a few hours and do it again before we
left for the day then in the morning reassemble the parts and flush with
brake fluid ,bleed and run.In two years at the lab I never had a problem as
well as the other more seasoned vets that taught me this relayed no
problems.I use this process on my VW's and have had no problems in five
years.Now mind this was done to test vehicles which were used very very hard
and often without negative effects.
