&gt; Need to make some room to tear apart my 56 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; 59-61 2/3 Middle Bus Seat   Jan. 09, 2001  Price:       550$  

&lt;I need a seat but $550??
&lt;and

I thought 550$ was resonable. 2/3 middle seats with a solid grab bar are few 
and far between. Last one I saw advertised was almost 1000$ and the frame was 
rusted with no upholstry!
Figure this ones 10 fold nicer and half the price.

&gt;***One end has been *SNAPPED*

Ooops, yes, I admit.....I broke it. Sometimes those aluminum ends just do not 
want to budge.

&lt;Couldn't you find a place to store it? 

What for? I rather see it go to someone who needs it....and besides I need 
the cash to pay for the huge list of parts I need for this rotten bus.

&lt;If it is worth over 5 big ones; 
&lt;sure thing the price will appreciate 
&lt;and you will be able to get
&lt;*even more* than your &quot;split seams&quot; 
&lt;broken &quot;Cash price is firm&quot; seat is worth now.
&lt;You're setting on a gold mine. Keep it!
&lt;Then you won't have to build that crate.

Hey, Im more than happy to negotiate if someone wants to cough up an early 
right rocker, some doglegs, a striped circus tent, front bumper brackets, 
rear splash pans, for my 56 circus bus.

&lt;Where did that no name camper you posted pictures of end up?
&lt;Did you get you asking price for it?

GAVE IT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!
I told everyone the price was negotiable.

&lt;A big Mahalo for offering the seat to the list 
&lt;before you offered it up to the gods of ebay.
