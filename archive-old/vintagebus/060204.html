&gt;Besides, after 5 years it will be impossible to determine if the paint has crapped-out because of
&gt;incompatible reducer or because it was sprayed with acrylic enamel by a novice painter.

That was the idea, Steve:)

&gt;&gt;My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?

I would also be interested to hear about Valu-Pro.
It looks to be related to PPG, but i can't find it on their website.
It's also at the bottom of the reasonable price scale, sorta like
a tractor paint in acrylic with the availability of tint mix options.
If it is durable and won't fade, it still has to be missing something
in the chemical department that adds cost ( and benefit ) to other brands.
