Please unsubsrcribe me from the list I have found lately that I do not
have time to read the list letters anymore. I will try to get back on at
a later date. I f this is not the way to unsubscribe from the list
please let me know. I am sorry in advance if this is the wrong way.

Thanks;

Michael Hathaway
