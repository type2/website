Straight from the horse's mouth:

Thom,
    Our bumpers are pretty nice. The ONLY thing that makes them different
from originals is on the rear bottom, there is a small cut away for the
Brazilian exhaust system. It is unnoticeable unless you are working on the
under carriage. As for the front, the top lip slightly rolls up. This
doesn't not effect the way the guards fit. As for the rest, no prob! There
is no discount for buying the whole set up, but they do come with all the
hardware you will require.
    If you have any further questions, you may e-mail me directly at my desk
at rmorris_at_wolfsburgwest_dot_com &lt;mailto:rmorris_at_wolfsburgwest_dot_com&gt;  
 
Thom
