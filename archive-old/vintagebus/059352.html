&lt;&lt; What are the drawbacks to having 15 inch tires on the rear wheels of a big
 stub (1965) pickup? I bought it that way and I don't know if I should change
 them back to 14 inch or leave them alone. The fronts have 14 inch tires.
  &gt;&gt;
I'd say the main drawback is that your spare tire is not the same as what's 
under all corners of the truck.   Though the 65 came with 14s all around, 
maybe a PO wanted a little more road speed.  
FWIW my 61 has the big stub/nut RGBs with 15&quot;s on the back.    Actually it 
has 14&quot;s on the front right now (till I get the 15&quot; rims powder coated and 
new tires), which makes the speedo read higher than it really goes, and the 
bus has that tilted nose dive look.
