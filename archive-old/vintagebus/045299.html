 The steering in my 59 panel is pretty bad... It's all over the road.
 The steering wheel has some play in it. The bus likes to steer itself. I can 
 compensate for it, but would really love a solid drive! I know this could be 
 a multitude of things, but want to know your opinions / tips, before I order 
 a rebuilt steering box!
 Thanks alot----
 Also what are the best shocks for my bus... I want a soft/ comfortable ride 
 (or at least as close to one as I can get w/ my '59...
 Thanks,
 Pete

Before you get a new steering box, you really need to identify what is wrong 
with your steering.  maybe  your box is fine, but you have a bad swing lever 
and worn king pins, or a bent tie rod.  Open your Idiot Book to the &quot;shimmies 
and shakes &quot; section and read it!  Follow the prodcedure.  If you don'r have 
a idiot book (John Muir, one of my gurus) go get one.

I can deal with about 3 inches play in the steering wheel, that's my limit.   
the 61 has that, though it needs a little more work to make me happy. 

personally I like the KYB GR-2 shocks  I put them all the way around, all 4.  
 Very cheap from Kustom 1 warehouse.
