OK kyle (westfailure) it's time to step up to the
plate and make those dang window tracks you told
me about and look robert davis needs some, i'll bet
he's got those tailights you need or some other goodies,
see i'm setting up a trade for you, also i could use 2 sets.

Hey Colleagues:

Got a question for all of you with the early style front sliding glass
windows, the ones without holes for the latch.  Pre '60?  Anyway, as
you know the felt track is different from the later style with the
latch thru the glass.  As far as I know noone repops the earlier style
felt.

The easy solution is to replace my sliding windows with the holes in
the glass.  But, like so many of you, I don't want to take the easy
route and would rather drive myself crazy trying to stay &quot;stock&quot;.

I've heard that one way is to buy two felt kits and cut them up and
somehow *splice* halves togehter to make one good set out of two. 
Tedious but maybe the only solution.

Any other ideas out there is Type II land?  TIA.

Robert
