Subject: Door Hinges

I'm putting together a 67 DC and I've run into a problem. The PO screwed
these large mirrors into the doors. (which I've since removed) I am want to
replace them with the correct mirrors. From all of the pictures I've seen,
the arms of the mirrors replace the pin in the door hinge. My question is...
Is there a secret to getting out the hinge that's in there now? I've tried
hitting it with a punch from underneath, but this thing won't budge.

Ronnie
