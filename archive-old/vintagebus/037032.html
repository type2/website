Subject: Bus transport offered
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Some time in the near future (April or May) I am expecting to transport a bus 
from Albuquerque to Monterey, California, and would be deadheading back at 
least as far as Las Vegas, Nevada.  Does anyone on the list need a bus 
brought from California (San Francisco to San Diego) to the Arizona/Nevada 
area?  

I would be glad to trailer any bus from the coast to Arizona or Nevada for 
minimal compensation to allay the cost of my trip.  I'll be driving a 1955 
Ch*vy Panel truck w/ my heavy duty trailer, so gas wouldn't be cheap, but I 
don't expect to charge much for my time or overhead.  Look on Everett's site, 
find the perfect vehicle for you, and let me know where you want it!  From 
Las Vegas to Albuquerque, I may be hauling a '66 Westy, so I can't go much 
further east than Flag or Tucson, but I'd be glad to help a listee get 
something off the West Coast (Wet Coast?) to a drier climate here in the 
desert.

Let me know...

JP
