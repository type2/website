&gt; Scott,

&gt; You made such a lovely post a while back about buses in the
&gt; local junk yards, Do you know of any splits currently in
&gt; local yards?

Hey Chris,
You know how to get a guy's attention.
Sorry, this time of year is always my busiest and just as I think its going
to slow down and I can start junk yard diving again, it starts up again.
Also, now that the weather is nice, I guess its time for me to start the
monthly &quot;therapy&quot; of strolling around looking for bargins.  Spring Break is
April 17th, so I'll try and get out there to our handfull of local yards at
least once that week.  I'll report if I come across anything worth reporting.

Scott
