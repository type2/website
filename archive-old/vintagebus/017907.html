My bad.

When I post replies, I try to include only the section
of the OG message which I thought pertained. 

But I overlooked the &quot;already-munged&quot; part. 

It was purely an oversight, not to surreptitiously
imply you were suggesting wanton hackdom. And the
safari window reference was just an attempt to
demonastrate the rustration which comes with having a
bus with a lot of &quot;year only&quot; parts. Not like it's as
tough as having a 54 RHD barndoor or anything, but
frustrating none the less.

Sorry about that.

67 21 window &quot;DARTH--no block-off plate to speak of in
any condition, nor a lighter but a new rubber knee
saver--VW&quot;

&gt; &gt;Me too, but since I have a '67. That's a 67-only
&gt; &gt;block-off plate. I might as well get a set of
&gt; original
&gt; &gt;safaris and mount it in one of the panes.  Sigla,
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;course (also see: driver's side window needed;

&gt; Do you work for a newspaper?  You're good at
&gt; &quot;creative&quot;
&gt; editing.  What I originally said was:

&gt; 
&gt; The poster that mentioned using the radio plate said
&gt; the one he had already had a hole in it, so he went
&gt; ahead and used it for the lighter.  That's why I put
&gt; the qualifier on my statement: &quot;if and only if you
&gt; have an already-munged blockoff plate&quot;.  But this
&gt; qualifier disappeared when the message was quoted...
&gt; hmm.
