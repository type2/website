&gt;On my F#_at_d tow truck I have Kumho which are great tires. They seem to be
&gt;an up and coming tire in the U S. and a lot of the water pumper crowd are
&gt;using their performance tires.

A friend of mine races a late-model Cobra Mustang in SCCA events and has
good things to say about Kumho's race tires.  Kumho is a Korean company.
The other brand he uses is Hoosier.

I've posted this before, but a while back, I wrote lots of tire companies
asking them what &quot;modern&quot; size/model of tire to use for my '64 Bus.  I
put the results here: http://members.cox_dot_net/mattroberds/tires.html
IMHO it is good to support companies that are helpful to potential
customers.

Before the tire FART gets cranked up again, I'll throw in a plug for
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/tires.htm .
