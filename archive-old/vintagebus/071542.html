Subject: [VB] Compression Ratio


&gt; What would be best compression ratio for this engine:
&gt; 78mm crank x 90.5 PC; oval ports; 40mm in - 37.5 mm ex; 1 5/8 exhaust
&gt; with heater boxes removed; doghouse cooling w/type 4 oil cooler. This
&gt; is my shot at a HIPO engine in a slittie still running RB with 3.88
&gt; RP/ 0.82 4th. Any advice or opinions on the compression ratio that I
should run with thiscombination?

Use no more than an Engle 120 cam ( it's a bus, right:)?
Keep the deck height around .050&quot; and semi-hemi cut the
chambers, keep CR around 8.5:1, and get some carbs.
