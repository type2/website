Subject: Re: [VB] manual carb install update.

update on the manual carb issue!!!!

of course, there's a piece missing, the piece that the cable screws to up 
front, luckily I have located one, but word out to anyone parting a trashed early 
bus to grab thouse pieces... the cable has a ring around it, that screws to 
aluminum thing that looks like a circle around the cable knob...  (the ring 
being in the tool area under the seat).  The piece under the knob.. that's the 
thing to grab.   Maybe I should take pics, huh?

I drilled the holes in the fan shroud.. actually took the shroud off so I 
could see what I was doing better.  You do need a long drill if you want them to 
line up.
