I don't support his theories on maintenance. When I got my 66 one of
the first projects was to fix my RGBs which had 2 stripped holes. It's
not a good idea to ignore stuff like that, but to honest there are a
LOT of cars that go around w/ major stuff like that wrong. My reason
for fixing it is why take a chance. My point is that he told you he
wouldn't do the work and you decided that he must be a lazy mech. From
an outside point of view it really sounds like he saw much more there
on the bus that he was willing or able to tackle. This includes
skillset as well as time. He really fluffed out by not telling you to
get this stuff fixed pronto, but not by him. Then again he might not
think it's a problem. (just dont ride anywhere with him). Besides, did
he charge for a travel visit? if not the advice you got was worth what
you paid for it. nada.
