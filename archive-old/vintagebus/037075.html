if you look at the bolt holes around the bell housing ,you'll see a little 
flat area just about 3/4 in from the out side edge ,,thats about the amount 
you need to take off ,,,use a dremel tool or a die grinder with a 1/8 or so 
cutter wheel you'll need some dip for the wheel to unload the build-up from 
it ,,and for the life of me i can't think of it this early in the morning 
,,,On another note ,,i'm headed to the redneck campout sometime Friday 
,,anybody else from Nc ,going ??if so contact we might can caravan ,,hehe  
i'll be in a *ord though,,,later
