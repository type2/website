Hi Bart,
Yes!  Change to a 72 and later dual MC.  That way if anything goes wrong 
again in the hydralic braking system you will still have about 50% of the 
brakes functioning!  Which will be far stornger than any panic grabbing of 
the E-brake.  See our article on this subject in the type2 Library.  Total 
cost with a little junkyard scavenging is about $50.00.   Eric&amp;Barb
