That's all I've used for the last ten years, not unheard of for me to get
10,000 plus out of the belts, the problem I seem to encounter is people over
tightening the belt on installation.

Does any one use these belts? I've had 6 belts on three different cars 
stretch out to zero shims within a few hundred miles. were I buy these belts

they tell me they had no problems with them. Richard and dawn had the same 
problem with contitech when I saw them at Busses and Balloons.
I've gone to a Kelly groove belt and so far so good.
Problem belts are Contitech 9.5 X 905 C9 made in Germany.
I've replaced both pullys(lined up correctly) and yes I do adjust the
tension 
correctly.
What gives?
