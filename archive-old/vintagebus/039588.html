Hey all,

Thanks for the replies. I should of been more specific, I'm using a timing 
gun and was positioning the vacuum dizzy in the same position as the 009 at 
TDC, which is set for 28-30 degrees total advance.  Thanks Matt for bringing 
up the condensor ground, a fellow local listee had brought that to my 
attention and is most likely it.  I agree with Clara on the fact that a 
dizzy and carb wont change my ratio, however I got hugh performance 
increases going w/ the 34 pict 3 and could maintain a higher top speed while 
the engine seemed to be at a lower rpm in comparison to the smaller carb, I 
don't have a tach so I can confirm.  I just couldn't handle the HUGE flat 
spot that the smaller carb masks w/ the 009.  I'm just hoping w/ flat spot 
eliminated and running the bigger carb my mind will be at ease doing 
60-65mph with out woring about my engine.

Thanks,

Eric
