 Gene Berg knew that if you ran your engine with a 6.6-1 compression
 ratio, dog house oil cooler and fan cover with flaps and thermostat,
 that it would be hard to overheat your air cooled vw.  I think that his
 dip stick oil temp gauge was his way to unnerve people who ran engines
 not built to his own very strict standards.  Gene was a difficult man
 when he thought you were ignoring his profound advice.  He was usually
 right...

There is this kid in town who had a 1776 with dual carbs in his mid 60s bug.  
The engine ran hot here, in the early spring!!!  which is quite an 
accomplishment.Though is is easy to pull high revs with a stock tranny and a 
big motor.   Takes half an hour to warm my bus up, how can he get his 
spitting hot in 15?  I did recommend a tuneup, eventually he got one.   His 
timing had been quite advanced, actually, and I suspected the degree pulley 
of being inaccurate.   Anyway, he ended up losing power, spinning the front 
main bearing.  SO he is getting another motor buildt, anyone want to join the 
betting pool on how long the next one will last?  Have no idea what the CR on 
the past motor was.  or the next one.
