 &lt;&lt; Eric &amp; Barb:  I will ask him about coating the inside/back of the 
 rims....thanks! &gt;&gt;
 
 Hi Gene,
 You are welcome!  The main thing is to explain to him that you are not 
 worried with having the special order white outer color coating getting on 
 the 80% semigloss black inner coating. 

=================
Hmmmm, why?   The  few bare rims I have with decent original paint, both 14&quot; 
and 15&quot; have white face, the rim tire side and center of bus side are black, 
without immediately noticable overspray from the white side.   

------------------------------------
BTW powder coatings when special 
 ordered are best used up within about 6 months or the powder sitting on the 
 self starts to turn into chunks like sugar left in a container too long.  
Our 
 shop was able to repowder and use the special order white color even after 6 
 years on the shelf somehow, but not all shops may be able to do this!
