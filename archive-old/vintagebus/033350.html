Someone must have the answer, so let me ask again. Does anyone know whether 
Izz(Izz's Safari Windows) is still around? I tried both his phone number and 
website and neither works. 

If anyone knows, could you please reply to me directly so I don't have to 
wait for the &quot;digest&quot;.

Thanks

Jerry
