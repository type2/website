I have those same holes on my '65 kombi. they are for a side tent, two
supporting poles go in the holes on the bumper, and the two brackets above the
cargo doors attach to the tent pipes somehow. I almost got it figured out this
summer then realize i was missing some a couple pipes, and never had time to
get them. I guess they are about teh same size pipe as electrical conduit.
