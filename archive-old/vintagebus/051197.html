Subject: [T2] Re:Listee stickers


Wouldn't this apply only if the graphic included a VW reference?  A bus 
graphic or the like masked by the lettering to &quot;conceal&quot; the logo couldn't 
be &quot;evil&quot; :-).

&gt; &gt; Well guys,
&gt; &gt; I came back to check my e-mail after posting this morning.......I 
&gt;believe
&gt; &gt; there is enough interest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is the scoop.....I am finalizing the artwork.  It will be a split 
&gt;bus
&gt; &gt; graphic with vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They will be cut vinyl stickers.  I'll start of with white and black and
&gt; &gt; worry about colors later.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not positive on price ...but don''t expect them to be higher than a 
&gt;few
&gt; &gt; bucks.  I will probably tack a dollar on to donate to the list fund 
&gt;though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can mail some out......I will likely accept payment with a SASE and 
&gt;then
&gt; &gt; send em out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regarding the type2 list....If there is interest I can possibly do a bay 
&gt;bus
&gt; &gt; sticker too. We'll check that out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Soon as i get the pic scanned, I'll post it to the web in a day or so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll keep you guys updated via list and will have some for OCTO.
