Subject: Another Road Trip in my bus
Date: Sun, 4 Jun 2000 11:24:09 -0500

Last Thursday after work, I hopped in the bus and headed to Lincoln, NE to
see Frank and Cheryl Musil.  We had made plans for me to show them the ins
and outs of web page design and uploading the resultant files in exchange
for BBQ ribs.  What a deal that was!  I have never eaten ribs from an honest
to goodness grill and were they ever good.  Cheryl threw in some baked beans
and a great jello/banana salad and made sure I was pumped full of tea the
whole evening.  Talk about being treated like a king!

I took Frank for a short little spin in the bus and I could tell that he
thoroughly enjoyed the ride and even though Cheryl stayed behind to watch
over Calvin, she seemed totally enamoured by the bus as well.  One of these
days we'll all have to pile in and cruise Lincoln. :-)

I hit a few snags while I was helping Frank with the web page stuff but he's
sharp enough that once I showed him how to get over some hurdles and covered
the basics, he'll have no problem figuring the rest of the stuff out. We did
hit one major snag that I believe involved the ISP.  We could create
directories and files but were denied permission to remove any of them
unless I did a direct FTP (the old fashioned way) but even then, only files
could be deleted, not directies.  Hmmmmm...........

As for the performance of the bus, I had a cool yet strong headwind on the
way up there.  After about 25 miles of driving the bus floored to maintain
65 mph, the Gene Berg temp dipstick told me I had better lay off.  So it was
3rd gear and 45 mph for about 5 miles until I hit the gas station and in
short order, I had the temp back down to 180.

Coming home between 12:30 and 1:30 with the wind at my back and fatigued, I
was able to maintain 65 to 70 no problem and was ready to hit the sack when
I finally made it back.

Yesterday I took a little 20 mile jog to the west to some land a friend of
my brother's bought.  We did a little target practice and tore around the
field in our little golf carts.  I didn't push the bus this time,
maintaining about 55 to 60 with a moderate NW headwind (What is it about
these confounded headwinds???)  The temp was fine.  Coming home, I found a
nice secluded black top and the bus and I hit a record high of 75 mph.  I
didn't feel like pushing it anymore than that.  I was doing about 65 the
rest of the way on the highway and just as I got outside Beatrice, the temp
light came on again.  But as soon as I got into town and started driving in
3rd gear, all was well.

So this raises a couple of questions that I would like to ask some of you.
I know this 1600 is getting a work out pulling the bus with it's freeway
flier trans and tall 15&quot; tires.  It really makes this bus scoot along but
I'm well aware that VW knew that to pull a certain load, the engine was
going to have to turn at a certain RPM throughout it's operating range in
order to keep the engine cool.  Will my 1776 with Berg sump, full flow
oiling, 40IDF's, and T4 oil cooler be able to handle this load without
overheating (anyone out there with real world examples?) or will my
overheating likely continue due to decreased RPM's at 4th gear speeds?

If so, then I've thought that I could either yank the freeway flier trans
out and replace it with my stock 67 unit OR try something simpler like
trading off my set of 5 white 15&quot; powdercoated rims and tires and go with
what seems to be the defacto standard on later buses - a set of P205's with
the 8ply sidewalls on 14&quot; rims in order to try to get engine RPM's higher to
maintain proper cooling and maybe at the same time it would help keep my bus
between the lines on the road (it seems to have a hard time doing this.)

I discussed all of this with you guys on the list before I went ahead and
did it.  I think people suggested either taller tires, or a freeway flier
tranny but not both.  I think by doing both I've shot myself in the foot.
We'll see what happens.
