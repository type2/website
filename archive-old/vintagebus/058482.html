Subject: RE: [VB] leaking crew cab

I have a similar question.  I get water in from a small lip along the =

fron doors at the vent windows.  I've got new seals but there's a small =
=3D
gap on the door itself...what's this all about, how can I deal with it?  =

Is there an additional seal that I'm missing????
