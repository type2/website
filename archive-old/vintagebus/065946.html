If you look at the newest VW parts catalog from J.C. Whitney they also sell
SCAT and CB Performance parts. Nearly all of the standard fare of engines
parts they sell are true VW parts. The engine tin comes in several flavors and
makers and I wouldn't buy anymore of the cheap aftermarket chrome stuff they
sell. Once it heats up the chrome starts separating and then they start
rusting.

The standard things I bought regularly if it was onsey twosy was gasket kits,
push rod tubes, bolt &amp; nut kits, .oo9 distributors and valve cover gaskets.

Has ANYONE gotten ANYTHING from JCW, that's worth ANYTHING?  I inquire
because I never even thought of buying VW parts from anywhere BUT a VW
house.  There is always the emergency local part house stop.  But that is
just to get you by until you find the correct part.  But maybe I'm missing
something...
