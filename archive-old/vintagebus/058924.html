Subject: RE: [VB] 412 gas heater in a bus?

&gt; I am getting a 412 gas heater for free and was wondering if anyone has
&gt; adapted it to work in a bus?
&gt;
&gt; I am thinking about making a custom westi rear facing seat (non-walk thru)
&gt; and adapting it in there.  Maybe mount it under the bus and tap into the
&gt; stock heater channel.
&gt;
&gt; I am not going to use the stock heat exchanger system, so I need some sort
&gt; of heat...


I put a BA4 (the 411/412 heater) in my '77 Westy some years ago.  The BA4
was considered a &quot;heater booster&quot; in that it was designed to augment, not
replace, the heater boxes. (It went inline between the heat exchangers and
the vents and heated the air up en route). I found it just marginally
sufficient in my '77, with good heater boxes and a typical east coast
climate (20's to 30's during the winter).  I suspect that you may find it
somewhat lacking if used without any heater boxes, depending on your local
climate.

Also, you should make sure that all of the parts are present. Many were not
attached directly to the heater, such as a triple relay, circuit breaker,
and timer/switch at the dash, and a temp sensor that mounted in the heater
ducting forward of the heater.   Without these components the unit will not
work safely/reliably.  At one time I provided a reprint of the BA4 service
manual to be put on the type2_dot_com website, which included full parts
diagrams, testing/repair info, and more. I believe that it is still there
somewhere (maybe at bustedbus?).  Otherwise you can look at a late
bus/Vanagon BA6 diagram to get a good idea. The major components are similar
except that the BA6 had a bigger furnace and an additional blower.  There is
info on the BA6 in the Bentley for the Vanagon.

The BA4 and BA6 are excellent heaters, and their flat profile makes them
ideal for under-floor mounting.  They also use several safety devices, so
they are (in my opinion) safer than many other gas heaters. However, like I
said, they were not meant to replace the heat exchangers.  Optimally you
would be better off locating a BA6 as it is larger and meant to heat the
interior off a Bus rather than a small car. Fortunately, if you put in the
BA4 now, and find a BA6 later, you can basically swap out just the furnace
section, and use all of the ancilliary items from the BA4 with it, since
they pretty much interchange.
