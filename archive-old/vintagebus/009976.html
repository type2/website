I have been having what Iexpected were electrical problems with my '67.
Sometimes when I would go to start the bus nothing happens (no red/green
lights; zilch!.  I would wiggle the wires and it would normally work just
fine.  I also noted that when I turn on the headlights, the car would miss
for a second and then be OK.  It would also die when I am at an intersection
for no reason, but start right back up.   This became a critical issue a
couple of days ago when the 'jiggle the wire' trick did not work.

I went out today with a pile of steel wool and emory cloth, and started
cleaning.  My inital focus was on the light switch (thanks Tom for the
previous tip) and discovered that the hot wire to the switch was hanging on
by a thread (of grunge I might add).  After cleaning all connections on the
switch and tightning the connector I put it all together.  I also cleaned
all the contacts on the fuse bus and replaced fuses while I was in the
neighborhood.

What a difference!!  Not only does the bus NOT skip a beat when Iturn the
headlights on, I swear that the headlights are considerably brighter as
well.

Thanks for the advice

--Rich
