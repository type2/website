Hey all!

I should have asked this before I went, so I could have hooked up
with some listees.  Anyway, did anyone go to the CMA festival
that was held southeast of Bastrop, Texas (east of Austin) this
past weekend?  No splitties, but I did met a guy from Austin
there with a '74 &quot;base model&quot; Westy; cabinets and jalousie windows
but no top hatch.  He wasn't on the Type2 list but I let him know
about it.  His Bus started as mostly light blue but now has
grafitti and symbols all over it, painted there at his request
by several attendees.  :)
