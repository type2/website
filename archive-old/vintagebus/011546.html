Clara, and other South Puget Sound area Type 2 folks...

Harbor Freight has just opened a store in Tacoma.  Took a quick walk
through the other day, and was suitably impressed with the variety of
tools and stuff available and the surprisingly reasonable prices.

It's located on 6th Avenue, just East of the Hwy. 16 overpass and across
from K-Mart.
