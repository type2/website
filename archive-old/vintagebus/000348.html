Werent bastard motors KNOWN for throwing a rod at UNDER 30K miles?
I heard Todd S. had one with 44K miles.......sounds like thats pushing it....

&lt;&lt;This whole discussion is fascinating to me, in light of the fact that my
recently-acquired '60 double-door panel (VIN 584609) would have originally
had a bastard engine in it.  The bus only has 59K original miles on it.  It
wasn't even registered until 1982, as it was used as a maid cart at the
Mission Bell Motel in Daly City from 1960-1982, where it only racked up 17K
miles.  But even with only 59K miles, the &quot;bastard&quot; is looong gone.
Doesn't speak much for their reliability, I suppose...
