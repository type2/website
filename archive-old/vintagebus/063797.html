Subject: Re: [VB] Ceramic choke coil insert--6v or 12v?


&gt;
&gt;Is the ceramic coil marked at all as to voltage?  If it seems to
&gt;work I wouldn't worry about it...

well, the only flaw in that theory is that a 6v heating coil run on 12v
would unload the choke much too fast. not a problem in the summer, but
might be annoying in winter.
