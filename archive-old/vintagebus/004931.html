My wife won't let me do the heavy work thats needed so I need to find a
reliable body shop to do the resto to my specifications. Anybody know of a
decent shop in the Los Angeles South Bay area with Spitty experience? (Long
Beach, San Pedro, Torrance, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, Gardena,
Hawthorne, El Segundo)

Suggestions much appreciated.
Thanks.
