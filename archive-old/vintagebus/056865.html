Subject: Deluxe Bus on TV!

Hi Volks,
Just caught a few minutes of &quot;Naked Chief&quot; on the Food Network channel.  In 
tonights episode shows the chief of the show driving a RHD 1961ish deluxe 
white lowered/blue bus for first minute or two of the show in England on 
probably the M5!  Looks like the episode repeats at 930PM tonight!
