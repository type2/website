mmm.. the earlier buses had the VIN plate in the engine compartment  instead 
of on the airbox overhead, ya and Ronnie has an earlier bus.   I guess I was 
confused about how you said it,   &quot;They  are all on the tag bay except the 164 
tag&quot;  I am not sure what that  means.
But were those ALL the M codes on your bus?  or are there also some  others?
Roger.. the 67 slider deluxe you had... did it have the lower trim on the  
rockers?   It had the subfloors, didn't  it?

Sorry dislexia rules ko! The 164 M code is not on the tag. 
This is the tag.
