&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 Too clarify the flywheel teeth were ingreat shape, and so were the 
 starter's.  Both 12v w/ prober starter bushing.  Flywheel was torqued to 
 spec.
 
 Thanks,
 
 eric
 
 
 &gt;&gt;FW and starter have matching style teeth (both either 12V or 6V) right?
 &gt;
 &gt;starter has new appropriate bushing
 &gt;
  &gt;&gt;
I have seen problems with the  tranny case starter bushing area being worn to 
the point where the starter to FW do not like up properly.

what I was saying is since you can hear the gnashing and grinding it will 
thrash and make the teeth no longer in great shape.
