Subject: Brakes Pulling Hard to Right


Pandora's brakes (64 with 67 running gear front and rear, single circuit
master cylinder) have been pulling hard to the right lately. Tried
adjusting it out, that didn't help. Suspected contamination, installed new
shoes left side, didn't help.

Rebuild the master cylinder next? The MC in it now has very low miles but I
didn't install it, the PPO did. Everything bleeds fine, there doesn't seem
to be a blockage, and everything on the left side seems to actuate fine
with the hub off.

When I replaced the shoes on the left side there was virtually no brake
dust...yeah, rebuild the MC. Thanks for listening. =^ )
