&gt;This is just a guess but would a Swiss prepped bus have different gearing in
&gt;the tranny or redux boxes to cope with the local topography? O seem to to

At least one of my 67 busses has the 043 code in question -- and they were
both US delivery.  Either some Swiss regulation is the same as a US reg, or
there is another option which superceded the Swiss..
