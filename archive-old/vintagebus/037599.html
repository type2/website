&lt;&lt; I have a 4o horse bus aircleaner then i think... has the metal elbow tube 
thingy and hangs down with this little bitty teeny tiny oilbath with a flap 
(broken and gone) and hole for preheat.
  I was told that if i run it on a 1600 the engine will suck the oil out of 
the bath due to its small size, is this true?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
We are running on of these on our 1641cc SP engine with no problems with 30Wt 
oil.  Though we now do run 20/20Wt oil in it due to our cooler weather up 
here in the PNW of USA.
