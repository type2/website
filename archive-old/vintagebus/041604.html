&gt; That's a fine place to have one, as long as you also have one before
&gt; the fuel pump.

I'll second this, provided that these two caveats are met:

1. The fuel lines are securely clamped to the filter (as should be all
connections on the pressure side of the fuel system)

2. The filter is secured or padded so that it cannot vibrate against
anything.  A crack in the filter would be bad news!

I still think that the best place for the filter is just after the outlet
of the fuel tank.  A bit messier to change, but it will protect the lines
and pump when located here.
