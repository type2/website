&gt; &lt;&lt; There is also noise coming from back there when the clutch is 
&gt; released, ie pedal to the floor.&gt;&gt;

&gt; Kind of a whirring sound?  That is what it sounds like when the 
&gt; clutch throwout bearing is offset from center to the clutch pressure 
&gt; plate.

&gt; &lt;&lt;  We are starting to get a little noise in the rear when the clutch 
&gt; is in, probably the throwout bearing, (maybe worse?).  &gt;&gt; 

I've also got a 'whirring' sound which I assumed was the clutch 
throw-out bearing, but I'm a little puzzled. The 'whirring' sound 
occurs when the bus is in neutral and the clutch pedal is out, but 
disappears when the clutch pedal is depressed. Is this consistent with 
the throw-out bearing being offset?

Thanks, as always, for any help.
