&gt; Thanks for the help. I didn't think the fine volks at the old VW would have 
&gt; left it exposed and rubbing.

Hi Joel,
You are welcome!  Forgot to mention the sheath accelerator cable protector 
was used as soon as tunnel case tranny was introduced in 1959.  Before this a 
bent box shaped wire was bolted on the forward end of the tranny and the 
cable went through that.  Would be nice to know if the later sheath cable 
protector will install in the earlier bus down to at least 1955.

&gt; So this housing (607mm long with flared rear end) for the throttle cable, is 
&gt; it the same kind of material as say a bicycle brake cablehousing?

Much like that, or more closely to the sheath of the reserve switch sheath 
used in all pre-1962 VWs, except in type 3.

&gt; Also, I am using one of those cut-to-fit empi throttle cables, like to 
&gt; replace with the proper one, you don't happen to know the correct length, 
&gt; my bugshop is learning old bus along with me...

You two should check into the 58-67 bus parts manual on vintagebus website 
then!
211 721 555 A 
Cable - Accelerator (length 3564 mm )
from Chassi No. 20 - 117 902 (MAR55) up to 215 036 650 (OCT64)

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel and the '64 Sundial (oh that singleport intake / stock exhaust, I
&gt; just love the way that engine sounds!)

It is nice to be so quite!
Eric&amp;Barb
