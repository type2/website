Yes pictures can be deceiving, I was told something totally different about
the 23 Deluxe, but the 53/54 panel was described pretty right on, Hell to
drive home over 2000 miles with 2 Barndoors regardless of their condition
made me feel all right, The 23 does have a lot of parts, it's totally
complete and have often do you see the fresh air scoop with AMBO fans? It's
a shame I have to cut it up but the last thing I need is another ornament in
my storage lot. I am going to cut the whole left side off and display the
logos and all. What will be available off of it is the roof clip, dash,
steering wheel and horn button, jail bars and luggage bar, Barndoor deluxe
beltline molding, bumper moldings, all glass Large Sekurite logo in
excellent shape, 2 16&quot; barndoor wheels, trans, front end, original engine,
spare tire tray, gas tank, spare tire strap, front seat, dash pods, 1 with
speedo (broken glass), 1 with the VW emblem, 1 with the clock (broken
glass), rear deck lid. I am keeping the corner windows and rear glass, front
and rear bumpers with splash pans and brackets for the panel, there is a lot
of stuff on this bus, I am telling the list first before I go public with
the parts, if there is anything, anybody is interested let me know.

I also have another 21 window roof clip, missing 1 skylight glass, a
complete set of 21 deluxe molding, 67 SO 42 ice box cabinet with water tank
and pump, early child's cot, big top tent poles (will put up tomorrow to
make sure all parts are there) no tent, and a few boxes full of misc. other
parts.

will have more pics up of both Barndoors and a trip report in a few days, I
will try to put somewhere else with a link, so I won't waste the list time
and space so those that want to read and see can and those that don't care
won't have to.

Ronnie   2000 miles in 56 hours
