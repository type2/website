Subject: My bus wont always start
Message-Id: &lt;v03110700b353713ae936_at_[38.28.38.91]&gt;

AHH!!! This is driving me crazy! Mabey one of you guys can help me here...
The other day i was driving on the freeway and my fan belt snaped (scared
the heck out of me) but immetatly I turned off the engine and coasted to
the side and put a new one on.... got back in started it up and drove
away... Well, ever since then my bus has only been starting on occasion...
There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when it will or will not start...
1. I know I have a full chrge on the battery but the wierd thing is that if
you jump it... it starts... its almost like it takes more then 12v to start
it or somthing... well, Anyway, the voltometer reads 12v at a full charge
(and I know the meter works too) I was thinking that mabey there was
somthing the fan belt hit when it broke.... Because I know that It ruined
my right pre-heat hose... Mabey it hit somthing else that i was unaware of.
I also was thinking that I may have  possibly put the belt on too tight? is
that a possibility? it seems to have a little play in it like it had
before..but would it affect the starting if it was to tight? hmmm... I know
you cant tell to well with out looking at it but any ideas would be greatly
appreciated!
Thanks a lot!
