&gt; Someone is pulling someone's leg here or we've all fallen victim
&gt; to another urban legend.  The August 1 date is a myth perpetrated
&gt; by VW. 

Hmmmh.

Interesting. I know that when we date a vehicle for parts info at the VW
shop where I work, we use august as the beginning production date. Parts
manuals back this up. Watercooled VWs have the production date (
month/year) stamped on a metalic sticker in the driver's door jamb. I
know that the 1.9liter to 2.1 liter vanagon engine change followed this
date exactly in 85/86.  

We use, however, for mid sixties and up aircooleds, the third numeral in
the vin...

Wouldn't the august 1 date and the vin given by Lester Prosser seem to
coroborate this &quot;urbann legend&quot;? 

&gt; And, Jack,
&gt; yours was made between June 22 and June 29 probably the 23rd or

 Actually, mine was made on June 21, 1965
