Subject: '59 Double Cab...engine stuff

My '59 Double Cab had been running bad. I had already tuned it up 
weeks ago. Also pulled the carb back then and cleaned/rebuilt it. It 
had junk in there and ran much better afterwards. I had trouble 
tuning the carb were the bus would keep running though. It kept 
wanting to die. So I ended up just twisting the carb 'til it worked. 
Best I could do at the time. Truck ran OK after that.

Cold came and I ended up parking the truck for a month or so. Got it 
back out yesterday to drive to work. Engine had no power. I thought 
something bad had finally happened. I got in it today and realized 
the spark plugs were all fouled up. Bosch supers. I cleaned them all 
up with a wire brush and piece of sandpaper. Good as new.

Put 'em back in and took truck for a test. Drove like a bat out of 
hell! Better than ever. I have to shamefully admit I never pulled the 
plugs to check them since I've owned the truck. Maybe a problem 
building all along.

I'm gonna keep an eye on them now and see what happens.

#3 and #1 had dry black carbon. A lot of it.

#4 and #2 had wet oily black carbon. More of it on those.

I'm not gonna mess with anything right now since it runs good. If I 
get problems again I'll twist on the carb again and try  to make sure 
it's set &quot;correct&quot; rather than what works. I snatched up my buddy's 
newish 30 PICT that he pulled to put a weber progressive on his duel 
port 1641cc. So I've got a good replacement to throw on there if I 
need to.

BTW his engine runs GREAT since he put the progressive kit on there. 
What's the opinion on these for upright engines?
