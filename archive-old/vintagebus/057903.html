&gt; Anyone going to the Vallejo show this weekend at the Solano Fairgrounds?
&gt;
&gt; I'm actually loading up stuff to swap. Hopefully make a little extra VW money
&gt; before Bug-o-Rama hits later this month.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone makes it, stop by. I'll be in my 15 window selling parts.

I know the usual group from Central Ca. will be there Saturday night, as well as
a few L.A. folks that came up for the Paso Robles show Saturday. Me personally I
will be towing out my '60 SO-23 so I can hopefully off it before Bug-O-Rama, my
girlfriend will be following in the DD EZ so we have somewhere to sleep (we're
also going out Saturday night, that's when all the real fun happens)

Look for the Green DD EZ with 2 matching Yellow / Grey Westy tents. I'll be in
the swap area stop by and say hi...................
