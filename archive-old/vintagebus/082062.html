Subject: Crankcase full of gas!!

Hey Y'all,
I've got a 1500 Single port engine that I just
discovered is leaking gasoline down into the crank
case while it has been sitting in my garage. The car
has not been run, other than starting it occasionally,
it's just been sitting, yet the gas keeps going into
the case. My question: Is there anything OTHER THAN a
bad fuel pump diaphram that could cause this to
happen? I ask because the fuel pump is NEW.  I have
also noticed that the carb needs a rebuild and when it
is running it is running WAY TOO RICH, too much gas
and the mixture adjusting screw on the side has no
effect when I turn it (this is why I know it needs
rebuilt). So could the carb be a culprit?? Could
gasoline make its way BEYOND the fuel pump into the
carb if the engine is NOT running???

Peace, John Baker
