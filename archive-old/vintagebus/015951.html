Subject: trailer hitch/exhaust

Is there some kind of aftermarket exhaust that will clear a trailer hitch- 
maybe one that has a flange to the side? I will be fabbing a hitch and 
noticed that the header flange is kind of low and in the center. I would 
like to keep the hitch up high as possible for clearance.What do you guys 
use with the hitch- stock exhaust? ronnie- anybody?
