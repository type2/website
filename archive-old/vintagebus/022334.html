Subject: Rear bumper brackets needed
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991015094610.0096a100_at_mail.softcom_dot_net&gt;

This is probably a long shot, but does anyone have an extra set of rear
bumper brackets for a '64 SC?  I would assume they're the same as any other
59-67 bus.  I got a really nice rear bumper with my SC, but the brackets I
also got with it appear to be from a bay window.  Any help out there?

Thanks,
