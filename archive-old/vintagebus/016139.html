Hey all...I was just poking around the VW website and stumbled across 
this show they're having in July at the Pond. They are planning on 
having a full vintage show as well I guess. Hhmmm...does anyone have 
any scoop on it? It's a bit steep to get into the show at $25 a 
head...but wouldn't the Zebra bus look great in there? :^)
