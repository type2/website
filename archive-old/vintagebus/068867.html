Subject: '65 tranny removal report (longish)

With the help and advice of Jason Johnson and Scott Kausch, we pulled the
tranny &amp; RGBs from my 65 standard tonight.  Removal went pretty much
without a hitch, per Bentley and Mike Gensler's article in the type2_dot_com
library.  Klingon Bird of Prey indeed!

After we got it out we rested it on a milk crate and scraped crud off the
RGBs and around the side plates.  Yanked backing plates and seal cover and
split the RGBs.  Things looked pretty good inside except, alas, two bad
bearings on the main axle shaft on the passenger side.  I'm gonna miss
that howl when it's done.

Only hassle so far, as expected the outer upper bearings were tough to get
behind and lever off the shaft.  Used a cheap puller and the
two-screwdriver method to get them off (thanks, Jason) and the gears
slipped right off.  A little tap with the sledge and the tubes &amp; RGB
halves came off.

I need some Bigass(tm) Snapring Pliers for the big ones inside the side
covers.  Which ones do you favor?

Can you get RGB bearings w/o buying the whole set?

Next, clean up &amp; remove nosecone and check bushings, and redo the plastic
bushes on the shiftrod, and get everything cleaned up in the tranny area
under the bus.

When my income tax check ever gets here, I'm sending off for my rebuilt
Rancho tranny &amp; all the parts.

A lot of work so far but no real surprises.  Absolutely nasty - the
tranny's been leaking so was covered with crud, and tonight it was very
warm &amp; muggy, so the still-cold concrete floor in the carport was sopping
wet.  Yick. 

It was GREAT having Jason and Scott to help - saved time and more
entertaining conversation than NPR.  :-)
