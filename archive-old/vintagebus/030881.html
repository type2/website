JP was fine and 5 by 5 at the Big Red Barn on Saturday, we did not see him on
Sunday at Kelly Park, whitch was great but a little different with the last
minnut split of the swapers and the car show types because of the very wet grass
that could not be parked on.

Ronnie and VW headed out Sunday afternoon also.

P &amp; C
59 ddr w/t w 65 ez camper no with many more parts


&gt; Just wondering how he was getting along in his major west coast Bus transport
&gt; endeavor.
