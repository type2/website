Hi there,

I just subscribed to this list as I just bought my first vintage bus.  I do 
have a 63 beetle but never a bus.  I just purchased a 59 Kombi.  I have a 
few questions:

1-is it common to have sliding windows between the front passenger area and 
the back cargo area?
 -- - -  - -
no, it's not.  but it'll keep the heat up front!!!   behind the front seat on 
the passenger side may be a small tag about 2 by 3 inches.    these were 
supposed to be installed on all buses from partlway into 58 at chassis 398 
xxx, but I have seen a bus later than that with the body number stmped there. 
 anyway, copy everything off that tag, and go to the vintage bus site for the 
M code decoder.   It is possible that you have a VW ambulance partition, then 
again it may be homemade.
............
2-the inside metal(as kombiis donit have wall panels or headliners, right?) 
is grey.  We were thinking of painting it the same as the outside of the 
bus-dove blue.  Does this lower the value or should we respray it with the 
original grey color?
 ------------
they came with panelling in the cab- on the roof, doors, in front of the 
feet, but gernally no not in the cargo area.   Painting it blue would mke it 
less original, and unless your really really have a desire for it to be blue, 
it usually holds value better being original.
..........
3-What is a good compression reading for a 36 HP engine.  I think itis a 
1100 or 1200.
---------
what does your compression read?   I would have to look it up to see if it is 
different than a 1600.   usually go by the over 100 and with 5-10 lbs of each 
other rule.   yes it's a 1200, but not the 40hp 1200.

4-Does this bus still need reinforced sidewall tires even if it isnit a 
camper and a pretty light vehicle in general compared to my 71 campmobile?
 -- - - - - - 

it'll work with passenger tires,  but it does handle better with LT tires.
