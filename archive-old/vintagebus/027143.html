&gt;     Summary: 1962 vw bus tent never used redish orange and white,
&gt;              (san jose, California (Northern))

The ad says (typos included):

&quot;Tent is from a vw camper bus , no rips in tent, no rips in changeing
room, has a plastic floor with stakes to hold it down, the tent bag is
used and the poles are used, The
 tent and changeing room ,floor and stakes were never used, &quot;

Yup, $1700 is a steep price -- UNLESS this is an extremely rare,
never-heard-of-before, &quot;Privy&quot;-style tent with a FLOOR.  A floor that is
undocumented in the literature.  That might be interesting.  I'd suspect
the plastic floor is a K-Mart tarp.

(The description suggests to me that perhaps this is TWO tents -- the
&quot;changeing [sic] room&quot; being what I call the &quot;Foyer&quot; tent.

And the tent bag and poles were used, but nothing else?

Folks, at that price, I would look this puppy over CLOSELY.  For lotsa
info on this tent style (assuming that's what it is), see
