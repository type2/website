I have both the aluminum and steel. The aluminum is much nicer looking and like Thom said it weighs almost nothing. I have one steel one that has a permanently attached chrome steel shift knob with a VW logo in the center it is really cool looking but it definitely weighs a ton. We just moved and a lot of stuff is still in boxes but I will see if I have any extra. I thought I had one of each that were extra. And for just $60 I would be glad to part with either. Just kidding I will look though.

Thanks,

Craig
