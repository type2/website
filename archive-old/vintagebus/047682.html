Subject: aftermarket supension advice wanted./60 for sale LONG
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    While we're on the subject of non-original parts, I very much want to 
build (or better yet buy)a stock height camper to travel in that does not 
have reduction boxes. Don't get me wrong I've got them on my 59' and plan to 
keep them there, I just dont want to get stuck in some backwoods town with RB 
trouble where the mechanics only have standard tools and they used all the 
old buses for target practice. The RBs are just something that if they go, 
you dont. no way to hobble home when ones shot. Should I just look for a bus 
with a later bus irs in it already (I don't think I could bring my self to 
cut one up that much) or put one of the stock height kits in. keeping in mind 
that I will be grafting a pop top into the bus and full camper set up with 
propane burners, a fridge, months worth of supplies and camping gear for 
hikes. so ther will be quite a bit of weight. I can have a local shop rebuild 
a tranny with custom gearing for the same price as a stock rebuild if this 
makes a difference. the engine will be a 1600 (maybe 1641) w/doghouse cooler. 

On a side note, I will be putting My 60' kombi up for sale. I cant bring my 
self to cut a hole in the roof for a pop top. I'm going to find one with more 
mods to cut. It has a small nut tranny, new brakes with about 30 miles on 
them and a rebuilt 1600sp. needs paint and a rocker welded in but comes with 
one from RMMW.  Over all very straight. This is the same bus that had the 
clunk after shifting that I asked the list about. I never investigated 
further (its still raining up here) but it was thought by most to be the 
front tranny mount or the reduction box to spring plate bolts needing to be 
tourqed down. one slightly fuzzy picture at

I'll try to get more up soon.
