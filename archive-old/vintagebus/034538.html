&lt;&lt; A diagram I have shows putting a washer or something on the end, but I
can't
 figure out how you are supposed to do that?  Is there something that you are
 supposed to snap to the end of the rod to keep it from coming out of the
 hoop?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
The washer you mention is the speed nut.  which is a kind of washer that has a
sprung locking hold on the shaft.  Larger versions of these are used on your
front emblem and the left axle side of the fresh air vent.  
&lt;&lt;
When I install all this, no matter how I adjust the bracket, the thermostat
is being pushed too far up.  In other words, when engine is stone cold the
flaps are still open about 80% of the way.&gt;&gt;
Sounds like you either have the wrong year parts or something is bent.
