Subject: Re: [VB] chicago area vw shops

Know of any other places within 800 miles that do work as good as Kelly
Brown's?

'58 Panel Bus
'60 European Beetle
'67 Deluxe Bus

&gt; While I will agree completely with your recommendation, I feel it's
&gt; prudent to point out the roughly 800 miles that separate them...
&gt;
&gt; There is someone on the list that specializes in VW restoration work and
&gt; he's damn good. I know because, I've been to his shop. His name is Kelly
&gt; Brown and you can't see pictures of his work at www.metwiz_dot_com
