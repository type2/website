Subject: Re: Bob Hoover Sermons on CD


&gt;Has anyone used the Sermons on a Power Mac.  I've got Adobe Acrobat,
&gt;will that be enough to view them??

Well there's not much that Joe didn't cover. 8) They are in hybrid ISO
9660/Mac HFS format and will behave properly on Macintoshes as well as
Windoze. Acrobat Reader for both platforms ships with it so it's
self-contained.
