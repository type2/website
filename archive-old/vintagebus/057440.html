Subject: Re: [VB] Ben Pons autograph?

Of course, someone will jump in at the last second with $551.37

&gt; &gt; Only as much as someone will pay for it.  It could be a 5-mile-from-new
&gt; &gt; 1951 deluxe with Ben Pon's autograph on the nose, but if nobody wants to
&gt; &gt; pay more than $500 for it, then it's not worth $500.  Period.
&gt; 
&gt; Ill go 550 but thats it.
&gt; (Already the price is being driven up, wait till the Japanese atart
&gt; bidding)
