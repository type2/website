A friend of mine just came over and bought a book at an auction.  The title
of the book is Fixing your Volkwagen by Jud Purvis.  It's got several
copyright dates with the newest being 1968.  Details on fixing 25 thru 40
horse engines are included as well split case trannies.  There is even a
split window bug on a hoist with heart tail lights on it!  Very vintage
stuff.

He gave $10 for it so I reimbursed him.  It's a cool book with lotsa old
pictures.  Oh yeah, the distributer cap with the wires coming out at a 90
degree angle was wild!  Vintage Vintage Vintage I tell ya!
