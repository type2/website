Subject: Re: [VB] Battery tray was Re: [VB] Battery hold down

My solution, which is going on nine years now, is to apply POR to the
cleaned and de-acidified battery area, then paint it your fave color.

I threw a square of extra rubber matting from the between-the-seats floor
matting material (1/8&quot; thick, with bumps) between the battery and the
tray, just to cushion the battery.

My holddown hardware was bought at a local Kragens, just the two long
J-bolts and the enclosed cross-piece, and the obligatory rubber washers,
etc, underneath with the nuts.
