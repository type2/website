 so, being new to thisnumbers thing, is this the sort of readings other 
people 
 are getting?
  &gt;&gt;


  I have a 66 with a single port 1600 and doghouse oil cooler. Mine runs 
between 200 and 210 on a level grade, on the highway, with both kids and the 
wife riding with me.. Add any kind of a grade to the scenario and the temp 
slowly begins to creep higher.I really so down once it tops 230
