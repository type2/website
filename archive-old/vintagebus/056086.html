Subject: Re: [VB] was Re: [VB] Grrr  Westfakia!  now its two tone westys

If the bus was bought, then taken to Westfalia, then is still would not have
the Phosfur panel in it.  It would have been yanked, and a seat would have
been put in it's place.

That's why I'm calling it a fake.

&gt; Why is it so hard for anyone to accept that this is a
&gt; westy? Why is there so many that think its a hack?
&gt; Because it has one jaulosie window?? Didnt dormobiles
&gt; come with one popout, one stationary, and one
&gt; jalousie? You guys never seen two tones westys before?
&gt; I don't own the bus, don't live near the bus, never
&gt; seen anymore of the bus then what is on the ad, but it
&gt; gripes me that everyone thinks its a fake. I thought
&gt; we were more educated than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ya- that bus seems to have an original interior
&gt; &gt; there, and carefully doesn't
&gt; &gt; show headliner-
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I have heard that once in a rare while westys were
&gt; &gt; made from standards,
&gt; &gt; Though it's much more likely that someone hacked in
&gt; &gt; a flip top, and installed
&gt; &gt; the kit.  You could buy kits for installing yourself
&gt; &gt; back in the day, make
&gt; &gt; your standard a 'westy'.
&gt; &gt;     The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense.
&gt; &gt; Halfway swap over is what it
&gt; &gt; implies.  Seen them w/ 5 (with solid in the closet)
&gt; &gt; or with the regular 4
&gt; &gt; solids 2/ popouts, but any mix and match jalousie
&gt; &gt; and popout was home grown.
