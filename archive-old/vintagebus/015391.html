hey,
they did sorta create a small scoop in the bay years but nothing to the 
extreme of those fiberglass things. during wind tunnel testing they probably 
came to the conclusion that air traveling over the vents would flow into the 
engine compartment just as well. and those fiberglass things wern't a vw 
accessory, just something that jc whitney has carried forthe last 40 years 
;) my bus has three holes around each vent where some dumb a$$ installed 
them, and horked the screws in so hard that ill have to tap em down fill em 
up.
