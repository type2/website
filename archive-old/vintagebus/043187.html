Hello all,

VeeWee's procedure is fine, but a loop used to come in the factory
replacement cables in order to catch and hold onto the pin in the control
sleeve. Without the loop, there may be a considerable loss of control
range or at least a free area spread between full-on and full -off.

When I prep spare cables, I use my spare factory NOS that I bought about
fifteen years ago as a template. I'll probably never use the factory NOS
unit. This unit is for the offset driver seat located control.
