Subject: Re: [VB] RE:'not for sale; it's just for display!'  (was Paint 
  availability)

&gt; People set up their tents, tow their single wheels trailers, display their
special camper accessories and those are 'not for sale; it's just for
display!'
&gt;
That's different, those are part of what they drove.  I wouldn't ask someone
if their rear bumper or steering wheel was for sale either.

&gt; Granted the setting in a swap ins't the best place to display your cool
rare parts, but heck, where else are you gonna display them and still keep
an eye on them????
&gt;
Uh, at your house where no one gets a five-finger discount?

Some of your other reasons were good ones but I think the parts should be
labeled &quot;Not for Sale&quot; or &quot;Info needed,&quot; not placed with everything else
that is for sale.  I've seen people with their little glass case where half
the stuff in there is for sale and half isn't.

No offense toward Roger, just general statements.
