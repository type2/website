&lt;&lt;  I am trying to figure out if it has a 4.125 or 4.375 R&amp;P. Is there 
something about the tranny that gives it away (assuming the one of the PO's 
did not split it and swap the R&amp;P)? &gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
You might check out the tranny # for year manufactured.  Though the only 
three way to make sure is to open the tranny up and see what is in there, 
tach the tranny while driving or turn the input shaft 100 RPM by hand while 
someone counts how many RPMs a raised rear wheel turns at the same time while 
the other wheel is locked or on the ground.

&lt;&lt;It is not actually very clear to me from past threads whether or not one 
could put a 12V 1600 straight onto a old 6V setup.&gt;&gt;
Most likely you would have to grind the bell housing for the slightly bigger 
12 volt flywheel to fit.
