&gt; Thanks Matt!

You're welcome.  I wasn't the only person to mention it, though.  :)

&gt; I dug around in my box of wire and found a ground wire from the hood
&gt; to chassis of one of my past Sciroccos, had to drill out one end of
&gt; the brass end so that the tranny mount bolt would fit thru it, presto.

Is this a flat braided strap?  How wide is it?  Most of the hood ground
straps I have seen on other cars are maybe 1/4&quot; wide.  This is fine for
carrying the current (maybe 40 A) back to the generator, but might not
work so well for the large starter currents (200 A or more).  An
&quot;official&quot; tranny ground strap is around 3/4&quot; or so wide, like the ground
strap from the battery.  It's probably equivalent to at least 6 or 8 AWG
wire.  Having _any_ wire there will help your grounding, but you might
melt a small wire with the starter one day.
