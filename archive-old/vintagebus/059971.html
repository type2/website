&gt; More testing. I am sorry if you have read this, but I'm trying to figure
&gt; out whether my stuff is going out. I have taken out ALL quotation marks. I
have been trying to get this out for so long the thread is old.


As I stated recently here, if at all possible you should build your own
engine. I looked and researched and asked lots of questions of
 knowledgeable people before I picked the highly reputed mechanic to build
my engine. I
 paid about $1800 for a new case and all the best parts...the guy made a
 mistake. He left out the plunger in the deep oil pressure relief valve.
The fact that the engine was otherwise well built is proved by the fact that
the engine did not burn itself up from low oil pressure the first week. It
an over a year and more than 10,000 miles before it threw a rod (actually
 the rod insert melted).

I would never have known it was not my fault until I made the decision
not to pay $800+ to have the mill repaired, to do it myself.

AND NOW, A TRUE LIFE STORY!!!!
 I fired up the personally hand built engine last weekend, after only about
16 hours of labor over 8 days, and was not terribly surprised to hear a
horrible screeching sound located behind the crank pulley. Being my
first engine, I assumed I had done something wrong. Before I pulled the
engine
out to crack it open I pulled off the pulley ( and for some reason the tin
behind the pulley) to check if I had the oil slinger in the right way. I
had. I started the engine again in a last check before pulling it and
splitting the case again and.....IT RAN PERFECTLY!!! It was the pulley
tin rubbing on the pulley!. There is a God!

BACK... TO BUILD YOUR OWN

 As the Beach Boys once said, &gt;You need a mess of help to stand alone&lt; For
my first engine build I needed,

1.  The OLD &quot;Idiots Book&quot; (the new editions are confusing with all the
modern info. You will still need a consultant to fill in the missing
info, update new info and translate. For instance; the book told me to
insert
cam followers. Being a dolt, I had to call someone to inform me that
this is actually a &quot;lifter&quot;. I know what a lifter looks like and what it
does, but I had never heard of a Cam follower.).

2. A good parts house with an old guy who knows the Type 1 engine, and
 is willing to inspect the parts for damage.( Lee Roy at Knights Foreign
Auto Parts
here in Dallas. )

 3. A good friend or relative who used to work for VW or repaired alot. (
My brother in law, Chuck).

4. A good junkyard/mechanic source for calls to identify the doohickey
 you've got in you hand and to supply obsolete parts and spacers and
shims, etc. (Glen at Pistons and Plugs, . You will really need him when you
do your
 suspension work)
.
 5. A generic parts house very near for cases of oil and odd sockets,
 filters, light bulbs, testers, etc. (Almost anybody but Pep Boys. Save
 your precious time and, even if they are the closest store, don't go to Pep
Boys).

And the patience of a loving spouse or partner.

P.S. I am thrilled to have found a guy with a tool call a Torque
 Doubler, or something like that. It uses a torque wrench and the flywheel
gear
teeth to tighten the gland nut to a million pounds using only 30 lbs of
pressure from you. He says that Kimco sells them. It was marvelous,
