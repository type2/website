&gt; Ellis sez,
&gt; I cannot and will not comment on the condition of the
&gt; Puck offered for sale as I have not inspected it.

Well, Dang Blam it, Jimbo, I have seen it and i will comment. Its a
really nice fixer-upper. It is about all there, and with a bit of
sprucing up would be a nice utilitarian rig. Not the trailer-queen
trailer with most chrome award winner by a stretch, even if it were
pulled behind the 67 westy resto from hell, but someone else's Paula is
sure to fall in love with it on those camping trips. 

And Wiley is a motivated seller. His Paula isnt completely on the
bandwagen as of late, if you get my meaning. So if someone wants a Puck,
and still have enough left in the bank account for a down payment on a
54 ambulance camper, this is the one. How much is that rig now? I see
$15k here, $10k there.... Im still willing to grab my paintbrush and
overalls and hop a train south. 

The Puck is $2250. See it at www.clubvw.corvallis.or_dot_us/wiley/wiley.htm

And give Wiley a call.
