Subject: Re:[VB]tranny options

Sounds like most people here are against running a swingaxle kit. I do
like the look of the stock height bus. I am concerned about being able
to find a good priced, reliable freeway flyer tranny. A freind of mine
that has ran a vw repair shop here for the last 20 years says that he
doesn't order trannys for customers anymore because he was replacing one
out of every four, using a couple of different well known companies. A
local tranny rebuilder that he has used lately( with about the same
results) told me that he would rebuild my tranny with a higher ring and
pinion for $450 which is about how much it would cost me total to do the
swing axle conversion, using lowered spindles, with the swing axle kit,
that  I found. I was however under the impression that you could not
just put a higher ring and pinion in the bus tranny. Am I wrong about
that? The other companies that I have priced are more like 6-8 hundred.
Also I wanted to know if I would have to change the tire I am using
(205/75 r14) if I only lowered the bus the 3 1/2 inches that the the
redux boxes raise the bus. Wouldn't this take the bus to the height of a
stock bug, and they run  15&quot; rims. I would not want to change my tires;
they were pretty expensive. I guess I am still not sure which would be
better suited for us. All of the info on what is involved part wise to
build a freeway flyer that I have read has been kind of conflicting.
What is really involved in building one may be useful in determining
whether I want to have it built locally. Thank you for the responses.
