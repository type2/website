&gt;&gt;  :-)  I've learned on hills to let the clutch out just to the point the
engine bogs down and then switch from brake to gas and take off.  It's a
no-roll start.  I trained my sister and brother this way and they took off
from hills with ease.  It's an easy trick once you get the hang of it.  &lt;&lt;
