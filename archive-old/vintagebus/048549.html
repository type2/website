Subject: OCTO and Classic Show Thanks

I went to Everett's site and read the flyer about the OCOT/Classic show but
didn't see any contact email's listed, so I thought I would put this out as
a general thank you to everyone involved in these events.

June is the perfect month for big shows, kids and teachers are out of
school, and the summer heat hasn't set in yet.  Whoever it was that set the
date for these shows, you planned it perfect, thanks, you must have been
thinking of people like myself.

I have always loved to go to VW events, but the long distance ones can only
be done in the summer vacation months.  I wish I could hit some of the big
long distance bus campouts that are in the spring and fall, but can't get
away for that long of time.

So once again, THANK YOU for planning these events in June, I love it!!!!

Ramblings from an old shop teacher,
