Nope, I was wrong. Upon further examination of the photos, the cabinet
does overlap the rear hatch. It is not the narrow one that I thought
it was. Sorry, Not a Kamper Kit.

&gt; I just posted 4 pics of my '66 WT kombi on www.thesamba_dot_com/vw under
Campers.
&gt;
&gt; The wood is really thin, cabinet missing behind passenger seat.
Sliding door on rear cabinet, z-bed of some kind. Rear mattress is
glued down, but looks like it has newer upholstery.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know what you think it is. I looked at every camper at BBBV
and didn't see one of this type or quality (or lack of quality.)
There's a few gouges and dents in the woodwork.  I have other plans
for the vehicle unless it's a rare spruce-goose companion camper or
something. The woodwork will be available at OCTO next month.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I need wipers, outside mirrors, belly pan and pedal pan for my
FM 23 Window. Hmmm, with great detailing and quality pictures, it may
take $8,000 on E-bay, &quot;as-is&quot;? Just need some 1/25th scale Dead
stickers and a throw-down account.
