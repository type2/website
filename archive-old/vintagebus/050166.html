Subject: Re: IRC Chat...


&gt;Man I must be retarded..but how the heck do ya get on the irc.type2 chat
&gt;line?....And I mean exactly cause something aint working here.

You have to have either access to the UNIX command line at your ISP, or a
chat application you can use with your PPP connection such as mIRC for PC
ir Ircle for Macintosh.

From the command line, type:

	irc Nickname irc.type2_dot_com

and then when connected type:

	/join #vw


If you are using a PPP program, you'll have to set it up to connect to
irc.type2_dot_com, set your nickname, etc.

It may seem like it's not working when actually there just isn't anybody
else there. The best time to catch other humans is around 9-11 p.m. US
Eastern time.
