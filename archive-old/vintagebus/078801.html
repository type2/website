Subject: Re: [VB] Back under a bus after 30 years! Transaxle question. 

I like your description of bad bearing. &quot;woowoowoo&quot; like out of tune guitar
strings is a bad bearing. I have been trying to imagine that it is my cheap
tires instead. At this point I would like to be in denial about the need for
a rebuild. Just keep saving up and don't drive too far from home.
