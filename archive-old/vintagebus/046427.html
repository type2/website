Subject: 67 motor &amp; trans into 57 dlx?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Would like to take the 57 on the trip up to the classic this year.  Cant dig 
up the funds to do the 36 and trans before the classic.  Basically what Id 
like to do is swap the trans with the later big nut from my 67 kombi.  I know 
it can be done but I have been given conflicting information as to what 
exactly I will have a problem with.  The main problem that I have been told I 
would be dealing with is the nose cone.  They have stated that a lip on the 
trans will not fit and that it shoul be ground down a bit.  True?

I am just getting as much info as I can before I take the leap.  Trading the 
drivetrain aint that hard but if I have to make any irreversable 
modifications then the whole project will be disregarded and Ill take the 67. 
 I would just like to take the 57 for a trip before its restored and I have 
to worry about chipping the paint and all that crap.
