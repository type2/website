&gt; yes, but wcm charges WAY WAY more than the dealer. i think form the dealer
&gt; they are less than $10 and thru wcm they are over $60 or more for a set,
&gt; and i believe wcm gets them through vw anyway. at least this was the
&gt; situation a few months ago.

&gt; &gt; &gt; pictures is in the book.   You can buy new rear tosion bushings (same
&gt; as a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bay window bus) at your VW dealer- install with talcum powder.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also available via WCM
