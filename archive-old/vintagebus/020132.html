How hot does this setup run?

Well, given that I could easily get up to 65-70 MPH in my 1600DP, stock 
tranny, '71,
except for temperature limitations, I'm curious:

1) does the type3 oil cooler match the same mounting as the normal
	1600DP oil cooler?  If it does, shouldn't we all be considering
	moving to this next time we have our engines out?  :)

2) does &quot;30 mm geared oil filter pump&quot; mean you have an external oil 
cooler/filter
	setup, or, if not, what *does* that mean?

3) how much do you think the dual kadrons (or generally increased fuel 
flow)
	helps the cooling?

4) what dizzy are you using?

&gt; ps. we are currently testing the difference on the type 1 verses the 
&gt; type 3
&gt; close fin cooler, should have realistic test results after this weekend.

keep us posted with your results!

cheers,
