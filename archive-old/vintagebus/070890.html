Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

The downside to filter/pumps, is that the galleys are small, reducing oil
pressure, but usually not enough to matter a lot on a mild to stock motor. I
definitly wouldn't run one on a high performance engine.

There is one model of stock muffler that we carry, that puts the preheater
pipe on the right hand side, and clears the filter/pumps.
