On second look, I think it's a standard.  It just doesn't
have the pop-outs for the 2 door or opposite windows, but
it does have middle and rear seats, unlike a combi.

I can't find a way to get behind the front seat, as the base
of the back just won't come up.  Oh yeah, I don't have a VIN
on paperwork, as there wasn't any paperwork.

Now that I take a closer look at some details, the windshield
wipers are locked in one position, straight up!  Nothing
short of breaking them will make them move however, oh well.

It does have totally clear front turn signal lenses tho.
Odd very wide front license plate holder, standard shape on rear.

&lt;&lt; I just got fixing my new bus!
 It was presented as a '66 Combi, with a two
 tone paint job, white over red.  The interior panels
 are the cheapo ones, no pop-outs, so it's a kombi.
 No uprights or overriders for the bumpers either.
 The right mirror arm is broken off, but the original
 driver side one is round.  It has all of the seats!

Strange muffler that starts correctly out the side,
but then goes straight back.  Oh well.
One wiper arm is a little bent too.
All of this for just seven and half!

I had to do some dis-assembly &amp; re-assembly to get
the front seat re-installed properly, but it went
pretty easy.

congrats on the new Bus!!!!!

no pop outs at all?  that is unusual.   what is the VIN?  It'll tell you
what
model in the second digit.  a 66 combi's VIN is 236 xxx xxx ,  the 3 stands
for combi model.
