Actually they make great campers for people who feel the need to bring with
them all the tools needed for a complete engine overhaul or any other event
that might happen on the road ... AND all ot the great buys and bargains at
swap meets and garage sales.

Having access to that back side of the pile/stash makes life much easier on
the 'hold-this' person.  (You know the assistant you always ask to 'hold
this' while you are working on a car, also known as the 'gopher' and
'clean-up' person.)  I do not have to climb in the bus to get things, I just
open the other doors.  (besides then I can get to MY hiding places for my
stash of buys.)

As for the disadvantages, well having no center table is not really missed
since after all that other stuff is piled in there is no room for a table.

Besides it is kewl and isn't that what busses are all about???
