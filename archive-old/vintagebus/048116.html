Did you ever figure out what you are doing with this?   If not I do have a 
couple nice 66 non cargo door handles.  Is yours keyed to your key?  If so 
you could switch ove rthe lock cylinder, or if not I could key it is you send 
me your key code as well.  Just an idea.

&lt;&lt; OK I have a flush shaft mechansim, So what you are saying I need an 
outside 
 handle to work the mechansim from the inside?  Where can I get an handle 
 like this?  This is going on a 66 Westy
 
 
 &gt;the door that has the outside handle on it the outside handle square shaft
 &gt;goes through the door mechanism, out the inside :) and the inside handle 
 &gt;fits
 &gt;on it.  If the shaft is about flush with the mechansim you have a cargo 
 &gt;door
 &gt;outside handle and it does not take and inside handle.
