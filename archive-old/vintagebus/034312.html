Stopped by the Best Western in Davenport last night and was rewarded by
seeing 2 of the 4 Hebmullers on the road in the USA, lots of split windows
and WCM's way-cool single cab. If you live near LaSalle, go see 'em at JC
Whitney tonight.

&gt;
&gt; To all,
&gt; If you go to The Omaha Volkswagen Club you can read a short report on
&gt; the Return to the Fatherland tour's Stop in Lincoln Nebraska last night.
&gt; I also have several pages of photos of some of the most valuable and
&gt; beautiful VW's I've seen. Check out the 1943 KDF. The West Coast Metric
&gt; support bus was kickin' tunes and Lorenzo from WCM seemed to be real
&gt; mello. He showed me the new WCM toy bus. A GOOD time was had by all.
&gt; The address is 204.26.80.78:8084
