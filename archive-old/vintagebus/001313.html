I was sitting on the can tonight and grabbed one of the complimentary VW
mags that graces this household and ran across a picture of Dean Lowry from
last year.  I scanned in the photo, added a caption, and a note at the
bottom.  Here's the URL if you'd like to see it.  The picture is big - 92K
so it is a bit graphic intensive.  Please excuse the poor scan quality as
well.
