Subject: Re: [VB] Straight Axle Kit Question (Vintage Nazi's need not respond)

Was 68 a one only year, a conversion year from 67 to newer style or is
that just
what everybody is using.  Why won't a 69 of a 67 work?  sorry for the
ingnorant
question, I just haven't done this yet and am interested in dropping my
23.

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt; The spring plates are special hacks, if you are a compotent welder you could
&gt; probably do it. The axles tubes are slightly? shortened 68 long spliners,
&gt; and the axles are just that TIII/T1 1968er, long spline/long alxes. Axle
&gt; ends appear to be stock, but the brakes are useally tIII installed swapped,
&gt; so ebrake and cyl are in TII attitude.
&gt;
&gt; You cannot use the stock 68 tubes and plates, your wheels will hit stuff, I
&gt; am told.
&gt; This is based on the wolfgang kit I just removed.

&gt;
&gt;  I am interested in putting a straight axle kit.
&gt;
&gt;  What I need to know is, does anyone really know how to actually MAKE the
&gt;  straight axle kit?
&gt;  What spring plates are used, what axle tubes are used, and what axle ends
&gt;  are used, and how is it all put together in the end? I am just curious,
&gt;  because it really looks like a '68 bug rear end, but I figure it couldn't
&gt; be
&gt;  just that easy.
&gt;
&gt;  Any information would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks
