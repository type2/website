Subject: Re:  [VB] &quot;67 interior colors
To: lucas7_at_webtv_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the interior colours for 67 were the same as 66, so that is two years.  The 
deluxes had special treatment in those years in that  they got coloured floor 
mats- the ones from the blue/white deluxes were a light blue, both in the cab 
and the cargo area.
The interior panels you want were only used in blue/white 66 and 67 deluxes 
were a light metallic blue and white, a stripe of one, then the othe, then 
the first again, dont remeber off hand which was where.  These same fabrics 
were used on the seats, with the white on the face of the seat, and the blue 
round the sides.  So I think that means the white was the middle stripe of 
the panels, and the blue the top and bottom stripes.
The inside front door handles were short flippers, in chrome, with a white 
plastic ring around them.  The interior door handles for the cargo doors were 
chrome, not white plastic, and the rings were chrome (for some reason they 
always used plastic rings in the front and chrome rings in teh back).   The 
67 outside door handles are different that 66 in that the key is different, 
you have the L series key which is longer.   Recently was informed that the 
front outside door handles were the sme in 68, and I looked at a 69's handles 
the other day and they seemed like the 67s as well!  the problem withthe 
longer key is that it weakens the outside cargo door handle, and it is easy 
to identify a 67 by its broken off cargo door handle.   unfortunately for 
someone torqueing on a stuck mechanism or locked door, breaking off the 
handle does not let you into the bus.

Dear List,
I am new to this list, and have a dilemma.
I am acquiring a 1967 Deluxe walk-thru, 13 window, in Cumulus White over
SeaBlue.  It is emply except for a couple of wall panels in a blue/white
combination.  Now I have inquired on a couple of other sites about this
combo, and searched about 25 pages of these archives...._dot_can't find out
if this was an interior for &quot;67 only, or if it was used in previous
years.  I am dealing with a guy who has bluish/white panels from his &quot;66
deluxe, but I want to make sure that they are correct for my bus. I am
in the bus registry, so if anyone can shed some light on this interior,
please let me know.  Also, are my seat stands a silver-beige?  Thanks so
much.
