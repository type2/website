You can usually feel quite a bit of the play you describe in an input
shaft. Not to worry.

The popping out of reverse problem is the detenses. which you can not
see through the bell housing.

The snap ring you can see does hold the shaft in place. You can pop it
off with a small long tool, and unscrew the shaft, if you for some
reason needed to replace an input shaft. I did this once when someone
had cut the shaft to try to make an electric motor work. You have to be
careful not to let the part it screws into fall into the innerds,
keeping force on the shaft until it is unscrewed, and also try not to
let the snap ring fall into the innerds....although it can be run
through the drain plug if needed, or fished out with a magnet.
But none of this will help wth the bad dentense for reverse.

On the bright side, if  it has to pop out of a gear, reverse is a good
one. Just remember to hold it in when you back up. Better than a 4th
gear bungie hold, or the all-too-miserable 2nd gear popping out, only
when you are trying to merge....Aaaargh!


As for your spindle nut, any vw shop should be able to get a new one for
you. If not, I may have a couple, or Ronnie or Ron or Charlie or someone
must have a supply of them for sale. Dont use the ball joint front end! 
Yuck! They steer like a bay window bus.....

&gt; To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,
&gt; 
&gt; In the mist of all the thrashing last week I had a few questions...
&gt; 
&gt; How much slop can there be in the tranny input shaft? i can move it up
&gt; and down with my finger. The unit doesn't have any problems except
&gt; popping out of 3rd on occasion on an extreme up hill grade.  When I
&gt; changed trans fluid (Stay Lube GL-4) the magnetic drain plugs has very
&gt; few filings and two chips about 1/4 the size of a pencil eraser when i
&gt; looked down the input shaft into the back end of the tranny i saw a snap
&gt; ring on the shaft. Is that what's holding the reverse gear and should i
&gt; be able to see it?
