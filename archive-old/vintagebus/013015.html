&gt; Hi,
&gt; The main thing to remember is to allow at least 1/4 of the gas can
to be 
&gt; empty.  This allows for the fuel to turn to vapor and not
overpressure the 
&gt; can due to too small of space.  Eric&amp;Barb

A good idea, but you don't have to leave the can 1/4 empty.  The fuel
has a particualr vapor pressure for a given temperature and the can
will have this pressure regardless of the amount of fuel in the can. 
You do have to leave a bit of space at the top of the can to allow for
expansion of the liquid fuel, but this is only about 5% of the can's
volume, assuming that you are fueling at 0C and heating fuel to 50C.
