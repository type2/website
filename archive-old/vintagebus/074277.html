Subject: RE: [VB] Brake MC clarification?

I have the adapter/72-79 MC on my 67, which was originally dual circuit.
Everything aligned perfectly with the original lines although I had to cut and
extend the second brake light sender wires. I have had no problems with wheel
lock up on front or rear and everything feels correct. The conversion has been
on my truck for 18 months and has worked out very well in around town and
hiway driving.

If you have a pure drum setup this conversion is not the best idea as the
rears lock before the front.
Good luck,
