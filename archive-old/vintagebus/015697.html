Subject: SOS - formula for chestnut brown?
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2000 21:57:53 +1000
Message-ID: &lt;20000330115626904.AAA420_at_steamer.pipeline_dot_com.au_at_pm2-2-ip32.pipeline_dot_com.au&gt;

Hey All,

I have a good friend who is ready to paint
his 55 in chestnut brown and sealing wax red.

Glasurit here in Oz has the formula for sealing
wax red but can't (apparently) source chestnut brown.

Would anybody have the Glasurit formula 
for chestnut brown, or a 'modern' formula
in any other brand?

Thanks

RobK
