Subject: How do you buy a new/old Governor

&gt;Hmmm. How much did they say Davis had in his war &gt;chest for the recall election? Now, who's trying to &gt;buy this one?

Uhh, He shouldn't have to buy it, he was ELECTED.

Bussin':

Finally got sealbelts in the new '65 for kiddos and took a 45 min. run thru the country.

Back home, dipstick was hot. Guess it's valves on sunday right? I think that's first location for hot problem.
