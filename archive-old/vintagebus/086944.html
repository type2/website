Subject: Re: [VB] constantly running on three cylinders

Sounds like oil is getting into the cylinder. Something may be worn out. Is 
it per chance spark plug #3?

1. worn rings,
2. scratch in the cylinder wall.
3. worn valve guide

Solutions:
1, New pistons and cylinders, may as well rebuild the heads
2.Just rebuild the heads.

The shop should be able to give you an idea of what is wrong. They should do 
a compression check and a vacuum test.
