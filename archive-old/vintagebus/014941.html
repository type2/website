Subject: Hubcap clips that dont suck?
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Source desired...

Currently on the 63 bus I have a full set of sucky
repop hubcap clips that work great until the first
time that you try to get the cap off of the wheel. As
careful as I try it is a b***h to get them off without
bending the clip.
Try and even touch them after that and they snap off
like a potato chip.
Have seen a scant few NOS clips for a scary price
sometime ago. This might be a case wherein &quot;real&quot; is
the only way to go...
Please email privately if a reasonably priced OEM/NOS
or a dependable repop source is known.
Thanks
