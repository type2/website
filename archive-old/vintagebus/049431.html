Subject: AIRS

I'm still a newbie on the list and haven't signed up with AIRS yet, but I
will do so today.  I think the additional hospitality is a great idea.  If
anyone is ever passing through Central Indiana, there's a dry place here
(if you wanna sleep inside you have to fight the Great Dane for the
Futon...).

Charlie, I agree 100% with your reasoning and motivation for the AIRS list.
It's about trying to piece together some sort of community in this global
life we lead.  Keep up the good work!
