Subject: Bus Sighting....

My kids got the new disney tarzan video a few days ago. Before the movie
there is an advert for a movie coming out straight to video at the end of
the month. I think the title is &quot;An extremely Goofy movie&quot; or something
like that. It's a cartoon with the Goofy character and his goofy kids going
to college I think.

During the advert it shows them loading up to go in an old cartoon
split-window bus! My 3-year old immediatly started yelling &quot;Boat-wagon,
boat-wagon Dad!&quot;. There's also a cartoon bug at the same time. Old VW's
make the perfect cartoon vehicles. Looks like the kids will be getting yet
another disney video at the end of the  month!
