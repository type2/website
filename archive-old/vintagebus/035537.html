&lt;&lt;&gt; I don't understand how anything could be damaged by holding a depressed
pedal

&gt;&gt;Have you ever removed your engine and seen where and how the t.o. bearing
operates?&lt;&lt;


Yes


&gt; Am I the only
&gt; one that keeps the car in first, and holds the pedal down?

&gt;&gt;I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope that you stop doing that. Your
throwout bearing is pressing against the rotating pressure plate with
several hundred pounds of pressure. It's a small fairly humble bearing,
and it doesn't ask much during its life, except not to use it too much.&lt;&lt;

Thanks for your concern,  another old habit to break.  As I said, 25 miles
since
replacement, could it wear in this short period? Well either way I've got some
work to do.
