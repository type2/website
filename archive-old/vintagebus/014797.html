Howdy Volks,
I'm a newbie to the list, but I have been using the archive and library for 
a while, so I know that all of you are indeed &quot;Volks Gurus&quot;.  I've got a 
couple of questions, so here goes.
I pulled the engine on my '67 Westy to clean in up, etc and see if I can't 
squeeze a few more miles out of it before doing a complete overhaul.  
However, once I put the engine back in, I couldn't get it to start.  With 
the Idiot guide in hand, I determined that I had no juice to the coil.  I 
went over everything I could think of, before finally finding that first 
fuse in the block had blown.  I replaced it and the bus started.  The funny 
thing is that the car started/ran well before I pulled the engine.  So the 
fuse must have gone bad while I had the engine out?  Any body else ever have 
this problem?
Also, when I start it now, the engine runs fast, then sputters and dies.  
What could cause this?  Everything &quot;should&quot; be the same as before I pulled 
the engine.  I'd appreciate any input you all could give
Rick
67 Westy
