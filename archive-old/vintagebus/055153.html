&gt; 
&gt; There still is!
&gt; Its mine....will be at pomona if I find a
&gt; trailer.....
&gt; 
&gt; I think 4K for that bus is CHEAP.
&gt; I've only ever seen/heard about 3 barndoor standard
&gt; or Kombi sunroofs.
&gt; ROTR!!!!!!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here's my two cents.
&gt; &gt; Four grand for that is way too much. Not too long
&gt; ago
&gt; &gt; there was a decent barndoor on the samba for 7k
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; was way more complete and restorable. I would love
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; brandoor but they are pretty expensive. have you
&gt; &gt; priced a 23 window lately? How about a middle
&gt; seat?
&gt; &gt; Ambulance fan?ect ect ect
