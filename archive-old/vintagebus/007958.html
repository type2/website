the light strings are in again
for all that have inquired that haven't purchased
and for those who asked here's the scoop

10 assorted new beetles (look more like early beetles) per string
4 colors per string  (blue, green, red and white)
beetles are approx. 2 inchs long
approx. 13 inchs apart, strings are 11 feet long
made in orient (where else)
pretty cool novelty for the holidays
next year BUSES (bus content)

$20  for 1 string    shipping included
$35  for 2 strings   shipping included

sorry, i know i shouldn't post prices but this will cut
down on my p mail replies
