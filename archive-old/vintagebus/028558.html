Subject: [VB] 1955 westy yellow interior
References: &lt;384057474.961529313680.JavaMail.root_at_web03_mc.mail_dot_com&gt;

For the record, my all original '62 Westy had the yellow/black plaid
interior. For data's sake, the paint was L380 Turquoise. I'll post
photos soon.

&gt; Mark wrote&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually the kit is from a 1959 and earlier kit! If it was
&gt; from 1960 it
&gt; would of had red and black plaid instead of the yellow and black plaid
&gt; that it is.How do I know you ask?That was my old kit!!
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, that is interesting. I have seen SO-23 kits up to late 1961 that
&gt; utilized the yellow/black plaid combo. Even some of the literature I have on
&gt; the &quot;Mosaic&quot; options in the early 60's show the yellow/black plaid.
