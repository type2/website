&gt; What I'm going to do (and I suggest Sam does it too) is get in there and 
&gt; look for the date stamp on the back of the speedo.

Hi Rachel,
OK we went out and with mirror and flashlight looked under the DEC1962 built 
SC dash and the date mark on the frontside of the speedo is 10.62!  It is an 
80 MPH model with red shift marks at 15, 25, &amp; 40 MPH.
   Hhhhmmmm, so went to the 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion that was 
built  DEC59.  Speedo date mark is 10.59!  It is a 70 MPH model with red 
shift marks at 10, 20 &amp; 33 MPH.  First marks on both speedos is a red line 
where to shift from first to second, second mark is two lines for second to 
third and three lines for third to fourth.
