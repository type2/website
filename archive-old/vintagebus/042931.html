First of all, I'd consider building a 1776cc instead of a 1835cc.  Reason
being the 1835cc uses very thin walled 92mm cylinders which are very prone
to overheating which is very easy to do in a heavy bus (compared to a
bug).  A 1776cc utilizes 90.5mm cylinders which are much more reliable and
run cooler.  If you ever read any articles by Gene Berg himself he says
that he never ever would use a set of 92mm pistons/cylinders because of
reduces engine life, overheating, etc, etc.  As for the crank, I've been
using a normal counterweighted crank in my 1776cc for years and it has
performed great.  The only thing I wished I would have done is have
everything balanced.  So I'm in the process of rebuilding my 1776cc again
and I'm definitly going to balance everything.  It's worth every penny
from what I've heard!  Good luck man!

&gt; Okay... I have seen the ads and read a little about the full circle cranks
&gt; (as in Berg).  However, what does the list think of these in terms of real
&gt; world experience versus the use of the std counter balanced ones?  Is the
&gt; Full Circle truly an improvement for a daily driver vehicle in terms of
&gt; longevity and smooth running or is it strictly a wahoo performance item and
&gt; to be avoided?  My son (Christian the new list member) and I have been
&gt; discussing this for our bus engines and would be interested in other
&gt; thoughts.  We are not out to build a quarter mile burner but want to balance
&gt; power and longevity in an 1835 with a single carb.
