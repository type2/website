&lt;first part of a scary story about a bus on fire snipped&gt;
&lt;As we join Glen, the situation is getting really tense...&gt;

&gt; Anticipating another combustion, I had the extinguisher primed and
&gt; ready. One hand held the hatch, one the extinguisher tank and
somewhere in
&gt; between the hose was being pointed into the opening. Sure enough as
soon as
&gt; a fresh supply of air rushed in flames leaped. But, two long shots
put the
&gt; fire out and a third killed the demon for good.

A small note on fire extinguisher technique:

Once you pull the trigger on a fire extinguisher, empty the _entire_
contents of the extinguisher on the base of the fire.  This maximizes
your chance of getting the fire completely out.

If you pause and the fire reignites you have lost ground to the fire
and will have to regain the advantage with the (hopefully) remaining
contents of the extinguisher.

Firefighting is no time for civilized behavior!  Hit the fire while
it's down, and keep hitting it!

BTW, it costs the same to refill an empty extinguisher as a half-empty
extinguisher :)

&lt;rest of story, with relatively happy ending, snipped too&gt;

&gt; Then before I start her up, I'll take my wife's car down to the
garage and
&gt; buy myself a fire extinguisher.

And make it a big one.  As big as you can live with.  Little ones just
won't cut it!  You were lucky that this was an electrical fire, not a
gasoline fire, which will tax the capability of any extinguisher.

The best place to mount the extinguisher is near the driver's seat
where you can pull it out while exiting the vehicle.  Horizontal
mounting under the dash in front of the steering column is a good
place.  You _don't_ want to put the extinguisher where you have to go
further into the vehicle to get it!

For dry chemical extinguishers, take the extinguisher out once a
month, flip it over, and give it a good shaking to keep the powder
loose.

Lastly, if the fire seems too big to handle, it is.  You can always
get another bus, but there's only one you.  Think before rushing into
danger!
