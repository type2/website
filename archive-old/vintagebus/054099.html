&lt;&lt; 1.) On a pre-1965 engine case with a &quot;B&quot; coded engine that was originally 
a 
 1500cc, what was the original case bore size on the number 1 bearing?  Our 
 case is measuring 2.5745&quot;.... comments? &gt;&gt;

Hi Steffan,
B code means AUG67 to JULY70.  It is time to have it bored for it's first cut.
 
&lt;&lt; 2.) Can you use the 1600cc cylinder bores in a 1500 case without 
machining? &gt;&gt;

You can use 1300, 1500, 1600 and slip in 1641cc P&amp;Cs without boring the 
cylinder holes in the case bigger.   Eric&amp;Barb
