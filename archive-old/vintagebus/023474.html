To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

My 61 DC has been backfiring a lot lately, when I let off the gas.  I have 
replaced:
plugs, plug wires, points, cap, rotor, and exhaust gaskets.  Checked/set 
timing, dwell, and valves.  Also done recently:  replaced the Weber 
progressive carb with a pair of celaned and rebuilt Kadrons (was backfiring 
before and after this), and replaced the generator with a new Bosch unit.  

Everything I have done has helped but I still get some popping when shifting 
and otherwise letting off the gas.  The engine is a 1915 (couple years old) 
with 041 heads (a year or so old).  It runs great and has plenty of power, 
but the popping is getting anoying, even though it is much better than it 
was.  

Any suggestions?  TIA......
