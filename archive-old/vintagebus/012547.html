&gt; I was thinking about putting a window from a 78 bus in my 66 deluxe
&gt; does anyone have any idea what the best way to go about this would be?
&gt; I feel it would really improve the visibility. I'm planning on doing the
job
&gt; thursday
&gt; 4/1/99 so any help would be great !!!
&gt; thanks
