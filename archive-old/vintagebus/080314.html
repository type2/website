Subject: Re: [VB] bus dies a lot.

I use a (wiped out) oil drain pan for taking the carb apart in... so I don't 
lose little pieces.   
As long as the shaft isn't worn out and leaking, I figure the carb is 
rebuildable.

to see if the choke is 6V or 12 V just look at it... it shoud say on the 
round thing there.
