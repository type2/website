&lt;&lt; I need to get a more complete shop manual for my 61 doublecab. I have read
about the Bentley manual and that sounds like the one for me.  Problem is that
I can only find it for post '63 buses. Is there an edition for the earlier
buses and if so where is the cheapest place to get it from? &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Get the 1963-67 Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual.  Other than the
front and rear turn signals being differant the bus was very much the same
from 1955-63.  Since 1963 is included in this shop manual it covers almost all
of the 1955-62 buses mechanical needs.  The only major changes and needs that
are not covered well would be the 36 &amp; Bastard 40 HP engines.  The former one
can cover by getting a aftermarket manual just for that engine for either/or
bus, bug.  The latter mostly would only be covered in the 1959 VW bus shop
manual.  Eric &amp; Barb
