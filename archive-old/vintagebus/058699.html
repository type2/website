&gt;
&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm trying to find one of the rubber seals in the fresh air duct.  If
&gt;you are sitting in the drivers seat there is a knob in the center of the
&gt;fresh air duct that vents the air to the driver and passenger area or to
&gt;the back of the bus.  I've looked through WCM catalog and have yet to
&gt;find the part number.  Does anybody know the part number to order?  I'm
&gt;holding off putting the roof on my bus to replace this piece and can't
&gt;find it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Aaron
