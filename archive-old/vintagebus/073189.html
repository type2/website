&gt; Greasy Volks,

&gt; Taking Bernie Bermann's advice, I used a 1750 pound clutch plate for My
&gt; Sweet Bus and her 1835 mildly souped.

It seems that Bergman's advice is often designed to sell Bergman's
products.

Unless you get slippage with the stock pressure plate then it will work
just fine and not overstress the clutch linkage.

The stiffer plate puts added strain on the clutch lever, cable, tube,
flexible bowden tube, clutch fork, bushings, throwout bearing and engine
crankshaft thrust bearing.  Seeing as how the Germans tend to design
pretty close to the limit anyway, I'd be leery of running a stiffer plate
unless you _really_ need to.  As you have found, another link in the chain
tends to break if you stress things beyond their design limits.
