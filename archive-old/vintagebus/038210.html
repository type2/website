My friend has a westy single burner stove that came with his 67 westy.
We know its rare.  But how much is it worth?  It still works.  Its a SIEVERT 
and says MODEL 925 Made In Sweden. on it. HAS anyone seen one? Its bowl 
shaped bottom that is Green and has a goldish top.   I will include some

ASK!!!.  Know anyone that wants to purchase the stove? or How much is it 
worth?
