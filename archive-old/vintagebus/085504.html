I hope you will continue to post from AridZona.  Let those who find it
tedious to read, STOP READING THEM!

Sounds pretty simple to me?!

Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus
Stuff.  Many times I have been asked to check out the Bus as it is somewhere
in AridZona.  I do all of this for free! I have put many buyers and sellers
together. If this is such a burden the  two Bus lists, then no problem.
What happens in AridZona will now stay in AridZona.
