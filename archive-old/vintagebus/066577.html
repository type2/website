Subject: RE: [VB] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

&gt; Does anyone on their lists use Verizon for there Wireless Phone
&gt; Service when Traveling in the buses, and regular use also of course.  I'm
&gt; wanting to change from SunCom and Verizon seems to have a better plan.


I have had Verizon for several years, here in Pa., and use it extensively on
the East Coast.  I have also used it in CA, NV, AZ, HI, and probably a few
states beyond the East Coast that aren't coming to mind right now.  I am in
a very rural section of PA, and frequently travel through rural parts of PA
and NY.  I have almost never come across a &quot;dead&quot; area that lasted longer
than about 10 minutes of driving or so, even in very remote or mountainous
parts of those states.  In fact my experience with Verizon's coverage has
been exceptional.  I have been places with friends who were on ATT, Sprint,
Cingular, and VoiceStream, and they had to borrow my phone because theirs
had no signal.

Of course this only proves that Verizon has better coverage than their
competitors in those areas to which I've been.  There are still a few
million miles that I have yet to test. :-)
