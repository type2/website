&lt;&lt; Is temporary(5-10 minutes) overheating harmful

 works fine now but I really want to know if there is anything I should check 
 to make sure my engine is still good. &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
First change your oil!  You not only probably cooked it which will lessen the 
lubrication properties, but also loosened all sorts of gunk inside of the 
engine case.  This gunk could be trying to clog up the oil passageways or 
even the oil cooler!  Plus while doing an oil change you can check for metal 
shavings on the sump plate to help you tea leave read what is going on in 
there.
