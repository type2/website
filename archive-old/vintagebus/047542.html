&lt;&lt; Yes we think it would be a good idea to have steps on both sides &gt;&gt;

I just put a side step on my Flipseat camper, and I'm really dreading a flat 
tire on the right side 'cause I bolted it on!

ya- I bolted mine on too.  Though I always carry a small rolling floor jack 
on road trips, just in case I need to pull someones motor, or deal with a 
flat tire.  a piece of plywood for those non cement surfaces can be crucial.  
  And a 19mm impact socket on a 1/2 drive breake rbar for undoing lugs.
