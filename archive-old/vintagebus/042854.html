I just have one more thing to say about the whole debate between
walk-throughs and bench seats, then I'll be done....I think.  All you guys
saying that its important to have your babe sittin' next to while your
drivin' have got your priorities in the wrong place.  In my opinion it's a
little better to be able to get to the back (you know, where the Z-bed
is! wink, wink) as easily as possible.  I'm only 5'9&quot; so the walking (or
running) to the back is not that big of a deal.  I respect everything else
that everyone has said and a lot of people have some really good points.
Enough even to make me want a bench....well, maybe not.  There's my $.02.
Pics of my newly aquired '65 walk-through should be on my web-sight soon,
if anyone really cares.
