&lt;&lt;  I got to thinking I'm going to put a T3 reverse light on the
 overider and wire it in to a dome light switch (since mine is missing and I
 wouldn't use it anyway) on the speedo pod.  This way I can flash people I see
 running up my arse ;-) &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Best to get a pair of back up lights.  Paint the inside of the clear lenses 
with yellow tint paint and wire them into the brake/turn signal bulbs.   
Yellow is alot easier to other drivers to see and react to!  If you want you 
can then install a momentary switch in the pod to bypass the brake switch to 
turn on the brake lights back there.
