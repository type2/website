Subject: ordering vw part from US to Canada

weell

everytime i order part from US it seems we have to pay tax on car part even
old volks !!

Why isnt there a free trade agreement??

Anyway, its seems easyier through USPS and i give a fake Company id, but
through UPS its a pain in the wallet... i wonder why sometimes company i US
are stubborn with shipping through UPS and dont make us Choose.

I recently canceled an order from CB perfomance because shipping is too
high, and few of my friends just order stuff from RMMotorworks and were
shocked at the shipping price, even if they choose the Ground shipping, RMM
factured the high rate shipping....

Thats why i usually choose Ebay, its easier to accomodate with the buyer on
the shipping way...

I recently bought someting from BUGCITY.COM and now UPS called me to pay for
custom...arrggg .. i hate UPS !!



Please let us choose who we want to ship... !!!
