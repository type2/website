Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

I have seen the stud break and the shaft slide out when the bearings in the 
tranny are shot.  Really bad.
then again, maybe you have one that just snapped.  I friend of mine drove 
around for years in a bug that the shaft would come out of when he pulled the 
motor.  At least a clutch alignment tool was handy!!!!

 normally there should be no strain on the stud.  so no reason to left it 
extra loose AFAIK. normally you don't torque it, but tighten it then back it 
up to so the splines of the collar fit.  Then the collar takes the twist.

 &gt; This causes me to wonder about the cause of that little stud breaking,
 &gt; which allows the input shaft to come out of the transmission.  If the
 &gt; input shaft is tightened on the stud before the splines are connected
 &gt; with the reverse gear then the stud is placed under great stress by
 &gt; sideways force on the input shaft.  this sideways force could be
 &gt; inadvertantly applied when dropping the engine, moving the 
 &gt; transmission,
 &gt; etc.
 &gt;
 &gt; It might be better to leave the input shaft slightly (say, a couple of
 &gt; splines) loose on the stud when assembling the transmission to prevent 
 &gt; the
 &gt; breaking of the stud.
