Subject: Re: [VB] Suggestions for tap/die set

Conrad,

As an alternative to buying a T&amp;D set, you may want to consider just
getting some hex rethreading dies and spiral point taps in the common
VW fastener sizes from an industrial supply place like MSC, Enco,
McMaster-Carr or KBC.  Hex rethreading dies are nice for doing repair
work because they have a fixed thread depth and you can turn them with
a wrench or socket.  Standard dies are often round (die holder
required) and are split for adjusting thread depth (which means you
may end up cutting the threads deeper than original).

From http://ecologicarchitecture_dot_com/SoloHobbit/fasteners/fasteners.htm
the common bus T&amp;D sizes would be M3x0.5, M4x0.7, M5x0.8, M6x1.0,
M8x1.25, M10x1.5, M12x1.75 and M12x1.5. M3.5x0.6 may be a bit of an
oddball since Enco doesn't list it for taps, although McMaster does
have it in their catalog.  I have several rethreading dies I bought
from Enco, and pretty much have only needed the M8 and M10 sizes for
the bus, which IIRC correspond to the bolts you would use 13 and 17mm
wrenches to remove.  I don't know if you wrench on non-VWs, but you
may want to throw in some 1/4&quot;-20, 3/8&quot;-16, etc.  in case you run into
the occasional voleretCh.
