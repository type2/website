hey,
i have heard, read or something that because of some sort of copyright laws 
that repop parts cannot be EXACT. is this true? this would explain the 
variance in some pieces. for instance i have an  outer rocker assembly from 
RMM for the cargo doors with the outer 10&quot; of floor all welded together from 
the factory and i measured it about a hunderd ways to see how it would fit 
and it seems to be a bit different. and a set of repop euro (amber on 
top)taillights i got from a friend, i tried to fit a &quot;real&quot; chrome ring on 
them, not even close. true, a dogleg would be a bi*#h to copy, but even some 
of the small stuff sucks.
