I think it is really cool to have an original bus.   Although people have 
made fun of my 53 for its non shiny state,   it does have the 5 rims it came 
with, with production dates shortly before the buses, and not only that but 
the early part numbers on almost everything, including (I love this) the LUG 
BOLTS!.  That's a neat thing about a low milage bus, apart from it not being 
worn to bits, it has the original bits on it.

then again, Never bothered to check date codes on wheels much for any other 
bus I have had.  Had a 58 DD panel, made sure it had all crows foor (or was 
it non) anyway they matched, rims.


what is an AR detail?

 I have a set date '58
 
 I think this is one of those excruciating AR details.  I frequently see
 people with cars for sale, and include the wheel dates.  Does it matter?
 So long as they're the type of wheels that the car is supposed to have, ie
 14&quot; wheels on you '67 instead of 16&quot;
 
 Some of these cars that I've seen that have the &quot;correct&quot; wheels as a
 selling point didn't have much else to stand on, as it were...

 &gt;jp told me one time that as far as he could determine the crows foot rims
 were outfitted on commercial type2s for just one or two years - '63 and '64
 i think.  he said he'd not found any information that stated whether the
 rims were installed both front a rear or just rear.  his truck now sports a
 complete set (including spare) though his truck's production isn't within
 the years these rims were used.  is this information of jp's inaccurate?
 is there some source that has the specifics?
