  Let me be the one of the first, as the rest are probably still clutching and shifting 
their way home, BBBV was way beyond expectations!  
  Erin has digitally covered the event so very thoroughly so all others can enjoy!  
How about those long distant guys from West Virginia?  Three guys and a big black 
Lab in '59 panel, still hanging out here and wanting to stay forever.
  Friday night sitting around the campfire I meet George Lyle, Harry Houck.  Britt Grannis ( who
picked up Erin and Rob from Omaha) is there, Old Volks (Ronnie) 'hisself', VWHoward and others passing by, Kyle, JP, Rachel, etc!  There were 41 listees in attendance, probably some sort of record in itself.
  The time spent with such fun people has to be experienced!  Talking engine theory with Erin let alone singing and playing-learning guitar, was enlightening to say the least!  Looking forward to postings of others when they return home safely q:-0

PS. The BBBs were removed from my '61 Westy on Friday and all is well, many BBB-V attendees said they saw them along the route to BBB-V q;{)
