&gt;     your fears are likely as unjustified as your hasty and derogatory
&gt; generalizations about the automotive maintenance industry. i think the
&quot;loose drain plug&quot; story is probably on an urban legends website
somewhere... though i am sure this happens from time to time, it is still a
classic paranoia-inducing tale.

Behavior of the type I was speaking should be spoken of in a derogatory
manner. My fears are neither unjustified, hasty, nor a generalization. My
previous boss had a lube and tune done on his pickup at a garden variety
lube joint. They failed to replace the plug on his differential. The rear
axle locked up on him halfway to the lake while he was towing his boat and
he ended up jackknifed in the ditch. Not an urban legend to me, I saw the
differential. The truck was under warranty and he missed the fishing trip,
so unless I seriously underestimated his intelligence, and I estimated low,
I doubt he did it to get a free rearend. I very specifically pointed out the
problem with the larger shops that hire unskilled labor to replace parts,
and the use of 'service advisors' to filter the information between the
customer and mechanic. The virtuous and principled industry you desribe is
not the one I have been doing business with for the last 20 years. I have
used several shops like that, but they move, retire, or close, and have not
been replaced in kind, so we're back at square one. The original discussion
was about turning drums, and I spoke my piece. If necessary, we can continue
to discuss my cynical view of the present state of the auto repair industry
in general where it will be more appropriate, off list.

&gt;     If you don't do it... find a technician or shop you trust to do the
work...
&gt; but verify that the work has been done and done properly.
&gt;     trust, but verify...

I agree totally, but that is as much trouble as doing it yourself.
