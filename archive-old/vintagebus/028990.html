Plugging engine tin eh?
Well...for the big heater hose holes.. a friend of mine had this on his 59
single cab...and I've used the idea since.
Take 2 pop cans, one razor (utility knife style), maybe a little punch, and a
small screw of desired size...
Cut the bottoms off the pop cans...just at the area where it starts to get
thin...where the bottom meets the side of the can.  If you don't want to
scratch your tin...i suppose you could put plasti-dip on the sharp ends or an
old seal or something along those lines...
then...poke a little hold in the center of each bottom.  Put one end on top of
the tin, and one end on the bottom of the tin and screw them together with the
screw.  It may have very small leaks...but a helluva lot better than that
enourmous hole.
You could even use a rivet in place of the screw I suppose...
