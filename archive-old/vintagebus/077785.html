Subject: RE: [VB] bus stalling

Kev,
I had the same problem when I got back home from Christmas vacation. I
had all of your symptoms and did everything you did including putting
some fuel additive to take the water out of the gas. I use two bottles
of cheap rubbing alcohol because that is the main ingredient to all of
the products on the market. No dice, so I knew my float bowl had water
in it. I pulled the carb and emptied the gas out of it and then put it
back on. While I was at it I changed the fuel filter. It fired up as
soon as gas pumped into the float bowl and that solved the problem.

While driving down the road recently it stalled out on me...kind of like
I had run out of gas...the needle was kind of low, so I thought maybe I
ran out...it started up again, but kept stalling, so I made it the
couple hundred yards to the gas station. Filled it up(only ~7 gals)So I
wasn't out of gas. I then drove to my mechanic-problem still there. I
could cruise along fine for a little while, then all of a sudden the
engine felt like it just stopped...like maybe it ran out of gas...
Any suggestions?

thanks
