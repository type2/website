Scott &quot;Mr SV2s_dot_com&quot; said:
&gt;Does anyone know anything about a 52 bus in Montclair, CA that's for sale?
I've only seen one picture, but was wondering if anyone had seen it in person.
&gt;
If this is the one on eBay, someone posted some negative comments on my
site about it:

----------------
'52 Barndoor On Ebay / Vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com Warning 
vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com seems to have the same 2 people. sonicvw and jonny5111
&quot;shill&quot; bidding on his auctions. All of them!! Take a look and be warned!!!
Do a &quot;sellers search&quot; for vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com and check all completed auctions
and you'll see!! 
----------------

So buyer beware, check your references, your mileage may vary, do not open
before christmas, do not use electrical appliances around water, do not
taunt happy fun ball, the math can't be done to prove me wrong, etc., etc..
