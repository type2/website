Ronnie, in downtown Phoenix on any given day you can see dozens of small 
caravans of new VW's just friving around.  Most will be filthy dirty for 
whatever reason.  Before the NB came out, I had already seen scores of them 
driving around.  With the VW proving grounds somewhere south of Phoenix, it 
stands to reason that they do a lot of testing here.  Can't say as I've seen 
anything resembling a bus though, just lots of Eurovans lately.  I'll pay 
more attention now that you have reported your sighting.
