If you don't have a real anvil (so few do these days :-), then a visit to

&gt; the local steel fabricators will usually produce an acceptable substitute.
&gt; for under $20.  Let them know what you want and they will set you up in a
&gt; jiffy. A length of rail from a railroad track can be quickly cut into a
&gt; very servicable anvil.

And GLOVES, big fat leather ones.
Funny how hard it is to find an anvil these days. Even harder to find the
specialty tools that go into that square hole. Hardies, I think they are
called.
I suspect some of us are a bunch of throwbacks.
