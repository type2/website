Subject: Pomona/Westy racks/seats

   One of the best Pomona's I ever had, why I don't know, could it have been
the Westfailure drawing all the people over? There were ton's of good parts
and deals. I got a real nice Allstate 1 wheel trailer for 100 dollars and
found a few other goodies. Pressed bumper city, if you needed one they were
there and at GOOD prices. A lot of nice buses for sale fair prices. 
   There were a lot of the Westy repo rack's there for sale, I'm down to my
last 2 out of 10. One is going on my Westy and I'm thinking of putting the
other on my one wheel trailer. The importer is sold out of these racks and I
was just informed that they do not have a PO issued for any more yet, so it
will/could be over or a few months till more are brought in. Those of you
that got one them are lucky and if you want one of these get it while you
still can.
   Where did all the middle seats go?? POMONA, I saw at least 5 of them
there for sale, one really nice 64-66 original upholstery for 400 dollars, 3
more full width and one 2/3 there, but only one rear seat.

ps. the drive out in the Westfailure was a thrill in itself, all the looks,
people coming up to you at every gas stop and the advantage of cruising at
80-85 mph with-out being affected by the wind or trucks.
