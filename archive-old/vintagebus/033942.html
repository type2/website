Additional note:
We know the pulleys should be aligned BUT....
Generator pulley is outboard of the the crank pulley.  There is no
material to be removed on the generator pulley to allow it to go inboard
anymore.

-----
what kind of Generator do you have.  there is a longer one that was used on 
71 buses, more amps,  and requires a certain kind of generator pulley, or 
it'll be offset.   what are the numbers on your generator?
