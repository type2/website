ATF contains less detergents than motor oil.  Unfortunatly, it's an old
wives tale that has survived (like taking the thermostat and flaps out of
the vw).  I've worked in the oil industry for 7 years now, and you'd be
amazed at how many wives tales are out there.

&gt; What the American old car guys I used to deal with
&gt; used to suggest for stuck rings was ATF (automatic
&gt; transmission fluid).  The story was it's very high
&gt; detergent, and if you run a quart of it for 100 miles
&gt; before an oil change, it could unstick bad rings.  In
&gt; our lower capacity engines, I'd probably try 1/2
&gt; quart, but what can it hurt?

&gt; &gt; Hi. A friend of mine has a low mileage but sitting

&gt; &gt; Clearly the
&gt; &gt; rings are stuck. We
&gt; &gt; have tried running Marvel Mystery Oil in the oil and
&gt; &gt; gas, but to no
&gt; &gt; avail.
