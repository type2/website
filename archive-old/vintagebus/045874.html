&lt;&lt; What type of tar are you using?&gt;&gt;

Hi Sunbuggy,
Henry # 108 Asphalt coating and Lap cement Nonfibered Brush Grade Solvent 
Based.  There are other brands that will work fine.  Main thing you are 
looking for when you open the can is a ultra-black oilly looking stuff that 
smells like a dock of street during the hottest part of summer.  We use the 
non-fibered stuff, but one could use the fibered type if they want or the 
body frame is in really bad shape and one needs to get it running to get it 
where you can do a proper repair to the area.  Tar used as a sealant is the 
only stuff that stops rust and seals out rust completely for decades.

&lt;&lt;Where is it purchased? &gt;&gt;

Most any hardware store in the roofing supply section.

&lt;&lt;Type of container it is in....._dot_caulk type method? &gt;&gt;

Every couple of year we buy it in the five gallon drum.  Can be bought in a 
one gallon size.  We use a condiment container bought from the super market 
to apply it.  One can use a screw open/closed tip mustard container, but any 
pressure on the tip causes it to close.
  Cleans up with kerosene or goop hand cleaner.  Please do not use gasolene!  
 Eric&amp;Barb
