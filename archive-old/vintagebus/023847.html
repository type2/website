Subject: Front seat mounts

List,

Thought it was time I quit lurking and got involved. My question is,
what is the best way to replace the front seat mounts? 

My '65 standard (non walk thru, split bench seat) had the stock seat
mounts removed who knows when. Judging by the hole patterns that were
drilled, I'm guessing that someone installed bucket seats a long time
ago. The folks I got the bus from torched some bent and busted stock
mounts back in, and did a really bad job of it. Give them a solid blow
with a hammer and chisel and they come right off.

After a little searching, I brought home, for lack of a better term, a
&quot;seat clip&quot;. The entire front seat mounting area, dogleg to dogleg,
front floor to spare tire area, top to bottom. Obviously more than I
needed, but I wasn't doing the cutting and the price was right.

The real question concerns the three bench mounts, is it better to cut
out the individual mounts, grind away what doesn't belong and weld those
back in? Or..section a couple of inches around each mount and weld that
entire piece in? The tracks for the adjustable driver seat will have to
be replaced also.

All the mounts are in place on the &quot;seat clip&quot; and are in excellent
shape awaiting surgery. Thanks for any help you can give me. I just want
to do it right the first time.
