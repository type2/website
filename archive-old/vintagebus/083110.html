Subject: RE: (VB) speaking of oil

With regard to the use and availability of 30 weight oil.
A chain auto parts store called SCHUCKS (at least here in Washington state)
sells Castrol HD 30WT oil. I always buy the case lot when I get oil since I'm
not planning to
switch oil weights anytime soon. I've also found that sometimes you must ask
for 30WT
oil when shopping, (some places don't put it out unless someone ask's for it).
Another thought,
(assuming your looking for 30WT oil) is to contact CASTROL and ask them who
distributes/sell's
their 30WT product in your area.
