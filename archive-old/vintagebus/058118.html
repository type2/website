Subject: Small nut versus big nut

Hi everyone,

Just a question about the differences in gear ratios between the big nut
(46mm) and small nut (36mm) RGBs.

IF I switched from big nut in my '66 to an earlier small nut RGB what would
the difference in gear ratios be?  Hopefully the same.  From what I can tell
it is a direct swap.

I am assuming the difference in gearing for the early splits was in the
transmission itself and not the RGBs?


Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
