Subject: Touch Up Paint

Volks,

I don't have the money for that full paint job I'd like to get my  
1967 bus, but I'd like to take care of some of the spot rust.

You know: sand, treat with naval jelly, wash, prime, paint.   Just  
the standard to keep the cancer from spreading.

Any suggestions on this and/or how to match the original (albeit  
faded from almost 40 years mostly in SoCal) white paint?  Or at least  
come close?

I have some of the DuPont rattlecan stuff from Autozone (&quot;Arctic  
White&quot; maybe?)  but I know that it's nowhere near the right white.   
And while I don't expect it to be perfect, I'd like to see how close  
I can get.

Thanks,
     Tom
