Subject: Drunk Driver Killed My Bus!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Just got finished washing my 67 kombi today and replaced the fan belt.  I got 
thirsty and left the house for a 3 mile cruise for refreshments.  Opened the 
safaris, what a nice day.  

All of a sudden a drunk on a bike pulls out right in front of me.  He almost 
dumps his bike and swerves right in front in my lane head on.  I swerve and 
he is still all over the place.  Luckily I miss him and the bus spares his 
life but the bus is on it's tippy toes.  I almost get the bus corrected but 
the rear left wheel graps the asphalt and over we go.

The passenger seat comes off the mounts and whacks me in the head.  My 
shoulder goes into the door panel and my knee hits the column.  Have a few 
tools in the bus which somehow find their mark, the back of my head.  

I come to a stop finally.  Off in the dirt in front of the bar that the drunk 
was coming from.  All hell breaks loose.  Everyone runs outside and Im amazed 
that I know everyone there.  I try to push the seat off of me but I cant so I 
just open the safari some more and crawl out after I shut the motor down.

I look to see if the drunk wiped out but he was gone.  I yell at someone I 
know in their truck to chase him and he does.  Look around a little dazed 
cursing every word imaginable and some that I made up on the spot.

Worried that the bus may catch fire, We tip it back on its feet and I 
disconnect the battery.  No leaks, no smoke.  Strange.

Cops show up and one just happens to be the same one who responded to the 
house alarm awhile back that drew his gun on me.  Joke a bit and get down to 
business. I give him the info and description of what the drunk looked like.  
Few minutes laer the chopper is in the air.  Seems that buddy is chasing him 
still.  The drunk pulls into his house and goes in.  Cops knock and he wont 
come out so they go in and get him.  Good!

BUSTED!

anyway, the bus slid along its drivers side.  No glass broke but my roof rack 
is manged.  Its a total.

So I guess now Im looking for a straight dry 55-61 single cab, 55-67 
standard, 59-63 15 window or a 21 or 23.  Maybe ill make up my mind what im 
looking for a little later.  Im a litle banged up but at least no one died.  
Oh and I started the bus up and drove it home afterwards!!!  :)
