so, last might i was working and i get a call from a guy named john. he
tells me that he's broken down in nashville on hwy 65 and 40. he said he
needed a fuel pump for his girlfriend's 74 bay.  i told him that i didn't
think i had a baywindow one, but we could take a look if he wanted to crash
in my driveway. he did so. i got home from work at around 10:00p to find
john and his buddy (sorry, i forgot your name) hangin' out in the bay.

to make a short story long, we looked through my stuff and found a fuel pump
off of my old motor. we comared the top halves of both pumps (which was
really the only part he needed) and they looked darn close. so john did the
swap and it was a successful swap. i think he is gongi to put a brand new
fuel pump on there asap just to be safe. so all was well. i met some very
cool vw friends, had some good vw talk, and had one vw in and out of my
driveway and john on his way.

john (better known as volknut_at_1st_dot_net) is a list member which made the
experience all that much cooler. john makes ther very cool vw stickers that
i highly endorse. he gave me a few in exchange for the pump and i had them
on my bus immediately. my favorite is &quot;don't laugh, your girlfriend could be
in here&quot;

chat ya later,
