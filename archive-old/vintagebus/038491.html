&gt; You can't expect a part or kit engineered

&gt; engineered by perfectionist Germans with engineering degrees and nearly
&gt; unlimited budgets, using state of the art tools, labs, and equipment (for
&gt; the 1960s of course).........

&gt; I have also read somewhere that the side scoops which used to be popular
&gt; for split buses (and mine has a pair!) actually block the air through the
&gt; louvers.  It seems that there is NOT a laminar flow of air along the side
&gt; of a bus, rather there is plenty of turbulence and eddies.  The direction
&gt; of the side scoops apparently does not coincide with the direction of the
&gt; air around the louvers at highway speeds, thus the scoops actually harm air
&gt; flow through the engine compartment.

This may very well be the reason that the first protoype buses made in 1949
had vertical louvers but were quickly changed in favor of the horizontal
ones the we have all come to love.

I have seen quite a few buses with louvers installed that either had the
originals cut out or 25 to 30 one inch holes drilled just aft of the
louvers. I have even seen one bay-window bus with holes drilled where
splittie louvers would be or even worse in the engine lid.

I have never had overheating problems with any buses that had the engine
compartment seal installed, flap and thermostat in and everything tuned
correctly. Perhaps more air flow would be needed for a larger engine but I
have no experience with &quot;muscle buses&quot; :)
