Subject: craftsman sandblaster

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I just bought a craftsman compressor at Sears.  It's 6.5 HP and is =
one of the black ones they say their professional line as opposed to the =
red ones.  Anyway, craftsman has a sandblaster that comes as an =
accessory. Does anyone have any experience with those?  The price does =
seem low for a good quality sandblaster and they don't stock them here =
in Kingston so I didn't get to look at it but I'm thinking about buying =
one in the next couple of weeks as I hear they'll be on sale but I don't =
want to buy it if it's crappy.  Does anyone know if they are crappy?

TIA
