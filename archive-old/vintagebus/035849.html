&lt;&lt; he only problem I had was the media size wasn't very regular, meaning I 
 kept having big chunks of oversized media clogging my nozzle.  &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
With the exception of the lumps, Is this stuff fine enough to be used in a 
regular sand blasting gun? Is there another source for it besides  body $hop 
suppliers?
thanks
