Hi All,
I have several sets of EMPI Rader wheels right now and am looking at
restoring some of them.  I've noticed several differences in the wheels and
thought others might be interested in what I have found so with a couple of
pictures and a little editing, I put together a page.

I plan to update the page as my restoration efforts progress.

The page is designed for the truly retentive ;-)

I hesitated to post this due to some of it's content... my flame suit is on.


David
