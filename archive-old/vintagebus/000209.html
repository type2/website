I live close enough to Barrett to drive to.
after buying the pos 70 westy, I saw them advertise new heads for a good 
price.
Called to make sure they were in stock and after I was assured they were made 
the 1hour trip. Get there and the kid at the counter tells me out of stock, 
ask what ya gonna do and he shrugs his shoulders. I don't even bother to read 
their ads anymore! Went to Kymco and for a couple bucks more got real new 
ones and an intelligent counter guy. From every thing I've read on the list 
it just isn't worth the small savings to buy someone else's rebuilt junk when 
the junk in your hand is prob better.
