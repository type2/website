if anybody out there is going to run an electric fuel pump be sure to buy the
one from cb performance.its a rotory fuel pump,and its not as loud as the
faucet style fuel pumps are.the pump from cb works good and it only puts out 3
or 3.5 psi.you can get it with different psi.but fot the stock carb all you
need is 3 psi.
