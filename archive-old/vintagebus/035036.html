Yes 
Clara &amp; Chris Canterbury unlowered my 63 singlecab.

They re-adjusted the splines on the rear torsion bars and clara replaced the
front torsion bars with a full set. 
When it was lowered the wrong way it was excrutiating to drive.
Going over the smallest bump caused a spine jarring effect in the cab.

I am really happy now. The front tyres of 135*15's have got the 165*15's from
the rear.
The rears are 205*15's which I am told are a tad too wide fro the standard bus
rims, but I feel happy with them.
The rear gate is 1-2 &quot; higher than the rear if Mister Truck (Clara's new 59
snglcab)
