Subject: Hey, is it hot in here, or is your chest on fire?

Hi Volks,

We've finally got things going on the 2005 Buses Of The Corn T-shirt.  
Below is an update from &quot;Adoom&quot; of Suburban Design Core:
The new shirt design is now online at:
http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/T-shirts.html
Get the rest of the info you need below:


Hi Volks,
Uncle Doom here with your, what seems to be an increasingly more  
often, plea to buy shirts.

Buses of the Corn shirts are on sale NOW!!!

Once again SDC is proud to offer an event shirt. The difference...you  
have to buy them...now.

As many of you may recall, I spent last years BOTC in the SDC tent  
screening everthing from shirts, to pants, to bricks, and not one  
single pair of underwear. Because of this, I am leaving the tent at  
home this year, and replacing it with a cooler. So this means that  
all shirts are on a pre-order basis. I will have a VERY limited  
quantity of shirts at the event. So limited infact that, like  
everybus, they will probably sell before I even get to the event.

&quot;BUT UNCLE DOOM, HOW CAN I AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT?&quot;, well first, start  
drinking a decent beer. Then take a look at the new design at http:// 
www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/T-shirts.html Then ORDER YOUR SHIRT NOW!

COST: $12 for SML - XL, and $15 for XXL and up. Youth sizes: $10 SML - L
DEADLINE: you must have your order in by 12 noon, July 25, 2005.
SHIPPING: Come to the event and you won't need to ship them.  
Otherwise, shipping is about $5.

The instructions that you have likely read before, but will read  
again anyways:
HOW TO ORDER:
1) Pmail me, NOT the list at: suburban_at_busesofthecorn_dot_com
2) Please put &quot;BOTC SHIRT&quot; in the subject line. This is important.  
Think of it as the most important thing you will do today.
3) Provide the following details:

NAME:
ADDRESS:
EMAIL WHERE I CAN CONTACT YOU:
SIZE:
QUANTITY:
PAYMENT METHOD: choose one. PAYPAL  MAILED CHEQUE

4) I will then reply, once orders have closed, with a confirmation  
email.
5) Remember orders close at noon July 25th.

Thanks again to Greg Potts, BOTC disOrganizer for letting us do this  
crazy mayhem. And to all the sponsors who make this event possible.
I will see everyone at the camp!
