 My '62 had Fuchs until I swapped them out to the &quot;Greek 
Bus&quot; 
&lt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/baja/outback/4014/buses.html&gt;
 IMHO Fuchs are a pain in the a$$. Mine were too wide 
(My rear fenders are still jacked up), adapters cause 
bump steer, caps kept getting ripped off, had to relieve 
the center to clear the spindles, and god forbid your 
wife comes home and tells you that she hit a curb!
 I'm not a vintage nazi or trying to flame, just 
relating my own frustrations with 'em.
 As far as polishing, Harry Houck just had his cookie 
cutters done, maybe he could relate his experience?

&gt; I found another set for sale, however.  They have been 
bead blasted.
My question is: Since they are now totally stripped, how 
do I polish them to
a bright shiny luster? Can I do it with my die grinder 
and polishing wheel?&lt;

No die grinding!  All elbow grease and a little bit of a 
buffing wheel.  I hope 
you have about 6-8 hours per wheel and some strong arms.
