Subject: Electrical help on 1/10th of a bus

Sorry for minimal bus content, but here goes:
 
I have made a Bus Wet bar and have it wired so that I can plug it into my house. I need to know how I can run the headlights as well. If for no  other reason than to get my friends to stop asking me if they work! 
 
I went to radio Shack and was told a 12v power converted would work (1000ma?) it didn't. After a few seconds the lights dimmed and then went out. I am not intersted in blinding people I just want them to glow a bit , sort of like a 12 volt headlight with a 6 volt battery. 
 
Any ideas?
