hey,
the rear cabinet in todd's dorm may not have been &quot;replaced&quot; with the SO-42 
cabinet, it may have never had one. it was an option in thew SO-44 interior. 
the more common SO-42 would have been an easier piece to find. i will get 
out to the garage tonite and get the #'s from mine and you can compare the 
two.
later,
