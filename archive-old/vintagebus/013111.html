Yup.  It's the latest craze; ever since Tiger Woods hit the scene.
Golf courses are going up like crazy; they're buying what was marginal
land and turning it into sand traps and putting greens.  The back
forty you couldn't give away a few years ago is worth a fortune now.
They've even figured out how to make grass grow in Arizona!
