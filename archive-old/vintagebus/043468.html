Subject: Re: [VB] Muffler too wide?  Fixed!

Hello again!

I finally got my muffler on the Bus.  I ended up buying a tiny (2 ton
rated) bottle jack.  I put the muffler over the right side head studs
and put a nut on loosely to hold it.  Then, I put the bottle jack
between the left frame rail and the left muffler flange casting, with
the ram on the frame rail.  I pumped the jack until the flange holes
lined up with the studs, then used a hammer and a drift (OK, a
screwdriver) to push the flange down over the studs.  Put the nuts
on all around and it tightened up just fine.
 
I tried something similar last night but the bottle jack I had (5 ton)
was too big and wouldn't quite fit between the muffler and the frame.
What I really wanted was a machinist's jack (a little screw jack) but
those are hard to come by on Sunday in Tulsa.  The small bottle jack
worked, though.

There were several emails with ideas and suggestions.  Thanks to
everyone who wrote!!
