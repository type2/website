Subject: [VB] engine vent trim reproduction - results
Message-ID: &lt;0.99e99a65.255db731_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I took a survey of the list, to see if there was interest in engine vent trim 
reproduction (for deluxes with outtie vents).  Here are the results:

1. Only ONE person replied saying they would be interested.  Therefore 
interest is rated as DEAD for the split list. Sorry Aarne.

2. Thom mention that Mark Adair (mark_at_cleanairtech_dot_com) was reproducing the 
trim. Emails to Mark have not been returned.

3. Rex mentioned I sould see if there was interest on the aircooled 
newsgroup.  I did not.  I figured vintagebus is where it's at for splitties, 
no?

4. Jerry said Robert Summers (not on-line) in Florida (941-699-2287) has been 
producing it for years. I did not call as my interest has dropped below the 
cost of a long distance call.    

So that is the result of the latest trim quest.
