&gt;  &gt;Does the M code plate get stamped upon completion of
&gt;  &gt;the build or during?? or is it when ready for delivery?
&gt;  
&gt;  There has been a lot of discussion about this.  I wonder if perhaps
&gt;  the M-code plates were stamped more than once?  For example, the
&gt;  plates could be stamped with option codes and color codes at the
&gt;  &quot;beginning&quot; of the line and the plate would travel with the Bus,
&gt;  so the line workers could install the proper options as it went
&gt;  along.  Sometime before the paint booth, it got stamped with the
&gt;  day (and maybe the chassis number if not done already) and installed.
&gt;  
&gt;  Why are we (or, &quot;Why am I&quot;) obsessed with this stuff?

I had the impression that the VIN was assigned early in the process.  But I 
dont have any real evidence.   the special models or buses with a bunch of M 
codes took more time to make.  and they may have slight discrepancies between 
their VIN and when the list of changes say which style of parts they got.  
Cause they would be pulled aside for a bit, while the special stuff got 
worked on, like a 23 takes more time to assemble than a panel van.

when was the body number assigned, for those fifies buses?
