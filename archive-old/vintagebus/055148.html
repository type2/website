Subject: Re: [VB] 6 Volts times 2 = 12v?

There is a company that makes specialty batteries for 6v vintage cars in a
variety of configurations even ones which will charge and start 6v but run
12v assy's. A search would hopefully turn them up.

&gt; This is what I am planning on doing in my bus.  I currently work for a Heavy
&gt; Truck Transmission manufacture and one of our transmissions run on 24Volts.
&gt; Since the US market is 12 Volts, we have a voltage doubler to raise the
&gt; voltage to 24 volts.  In looking at this doubler it works from 6V to 12V.
&gt; So it should work for the bus to give me 12V power to the electronics that
&gt; need it, but will still be able to leave the bus at 6V.   The company that
&gt; makes this &quot;heavy duty&quot; doubler is Sure Power Industries.  I know they have
&gt; a website and you may want to check that out for further info.
