Subject: door and headlight interchangeability

Howdy all!

New to the world of splitties, and I cannot seem to
find any information about the interchangeability of
parts for my bus (a '59 Panel).  What I am wondering:

What years cargo doors will fit my bus?

And what years of headlight buckets will fit my bus?

I am in need of both of these things rust free, so
information or doors/headlight buckets would be
appreciated.

Thanks
