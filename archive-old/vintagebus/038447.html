I took some photos of my Hoover Bit as I installed it.  The photos that were
previously mentioned on this list are no longer working on the WWW.

I have a lot of other misc photos and will put a few more up as I go along.
I will try to snap some photos of my Dual Kadron install in an attempt to
help others :)  That should be later this week.
