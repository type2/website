   Justin Carven showed up at Space Aliens Bar and Grill in a strange
vehicle, powered by a strange fuel, with a strange request.  

   He wanted his fuel tank filled with vegetable oil.  

   &quot;First I talked to the hostess. She just started laughing,&quot; said Carven,
23. &quot;Then she got the kitchen manager, and he was all excited. He brought
half the staff with him.&quot; 

     Carven and co-pilot Skip Wrightson, 22, then poured old cooking oil
into their gas tank. They reached into the used-oil vat, scooped out 25
gallons of cooking oil, ran it through some doubled-up nylons, then through
a paper cooking oil filter and into the tank.  

   And their Volkswagen van kept running.  

   Diesel engines run just fine on vegetable oil - even oil that has cooked
a few batches of french fries, Carven said.  

   Carven, from Hampshire College in Massachusetts, is working on his senior
thesis to develop a vegetable oil conversion kit for diesels, and now
they're out to prove that it works.  

   Carven and Wrightson will have run about 10,000 miles on cooking oil by
the time they get home next month.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
