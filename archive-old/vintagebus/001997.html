Want to think the list for listing the different side steps. After picking
up the Camper America ,stopped at a flee market down the street and saw a
black diamond plate thing that looked like a side step but not alum. Cory
walked right by and missed it. If not for the list I would have to. Anyway
got it for $2.00. Sticker on the back says: Side Step
Part No. 408 VW Trucks and Station Wagons Manufactured by Gibbes Machinery
Co.
 Columbia S.C. its cool and will go on the C.A. camper. It pays to read the
list. See you in Havasu. NEATO is donating 1 year membership to the raffle.
Email me or ronnie for flier.
