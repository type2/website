Subject: Insurance Definitions

We had a discussion a week or so ago about types of insurance policies,
so I asked a friend of mine that works in the biz:

Stated Value: the amount that your premiums are based on, this is also 
the maximum amount that you will be paid for any item.  There is no 
guarantee that you will be paid this much.

Actual Cash Value:  The value of the item at the time of loss, most policies, 
especially vehicles are paid based on ACV.

Agreed Value: Same idea as a life insurance policy.  Your car is killed 
in an accident, you get this much money.  You have to have a total loss 
for this to kick in.
