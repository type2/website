&gt; There is a top notch place for VW stuff in Lanham that is having an open

&gt; http://www.peekperformance_dot_com on the net for all the details...  And I

yeah Peek Performance is a great place, they really know their way around
VW's but they are more high performance oriented, have never had any work
done there so can't comment, but have gotten a lot of parts there and they
were always the right part and usually they had it in stock, including
some really off the wall stuff.  prices are about list though

unfortunately for me they are a little off the beaten track
