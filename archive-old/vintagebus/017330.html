Umm, fixing the grounds is what led to the problem in the first place
(well, more precisely, untangling the mess of twisted-together wires
that were mostly, but not completely, broken off).  I'm pretty sure
Herr Roberds' posting is correct, as I did see one of the wires from
the relays up front spliced into one of the (supposedly) tail light
wires.  It's just a matter of chasing down which one goes where up
front, and making the back set do the same thing.

FWIW, all the rear lights are really bright now, even in direct
sunlight.  Almost makes the LED plan superfluous....
