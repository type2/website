Subject: Re: [VB] Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

For best results using a 009 with a 34 Pict, there are a couple things you
must do.

Plug the hole in the throttle plate. Most people drill it out to 1/8&quot; and
use a pop-rivit, then install a 135 main jet.  This will cure all the
hesitation problems from this combo, but gas mileage will be quite low.

The 34Pict was designed to be used with a distributor with vacuum advance.
We at Aircooled.Net highly recommend our SVDA (Single Vacuum, Dual Advance)
distributor. In my 64 bus, I got a best of 28mpg on the highway doing 60mph.
Driving 65mph gives me 25mpg, and around town I get 21-22mpg. I can stick my
bus in 4th gear doing 1000 rpm, stomp the pedal, and have no hesitation
through the entire rpm range.

We also carry a wide selection of idle and main jets for the 34 Pict and can
ship them first class to save you some money on shipping if you wanted.
