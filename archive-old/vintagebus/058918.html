Subject: RE: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler

&gt;   There are 4 different manufacturers of European mufflers out
&gt; there (that I
&gt; have dealt with). 2 being  made in Germany and the other 2 in Denmark. I
&gt; have found that the Leitzritz (German) fits the best with the J and P
&gt; (Denmark) being second with the Dansk the most inconsistent of
&gt; the 3 (people will say the J and P and Dansk are the same, but they are
not)

Actually they _are_ the same.  What you are referring to as &quot;J and P&quot; is
actually the logo of the Danish firm Jopex, who also produces under the
Dansk trademark (primarily for the U.S).  These are not two separate
companies or two separate factories; they are from the same exact same
assembly line. If you have seen any difference between products under these
two names, it may have been because they were from different production
runs, but would not be related to the branding. Jopex does sometimes rebrand
other products as their own (under either name), so if you noticed some
inconsistency of quality this might explain it (although I myself have not
generally seen any). For example they sell, as Danish made, a Vanagon
muffler that I know for a fact is made in South Africa, because I get the
identical muffler right from the South African factory that makes it.

&gt; I think the Ernst are made in Brazil and sold as German.

The Ernsts are not Brazilian.  I get them right from Germany myself, and
they are clearly and visibly different from the Brazilian product.
Personally I prefer the Ernst to both Jopex and the South American product
(although I haven't tried the OE Brazil ones so I couldn't comment on them).
