I have used a torquemeister, it was excellent.

but it was not mine, I dont have one.  

I have a 3/4 &quot; breaker bar and 36mm and 46mm sockets and a 5ft cheater pipe 
which I always take one road trips.  Have used them too.   The 5ft pipe fits 
across the width of the bus just forward of the base of the Z bed, doesn't 
get in the way at all.

Have also used the poundy things, and also impact with a compressor (the 
latter not on the side of the highway obviously), but have dubious faith in 
their impacts on the bearings.   Then again, if something falls apart in your 
rear brakes and you are in the mountains of Pennsylvania, and you dont have a 
suitable tool with you, but borrow one at a shop so you dot miss the next 
Dead show, you dont go on a road trip with out it again.  You never know when 
you need it.  I carry the 46 for the rear axle nut and the 36 for the FW nut.
