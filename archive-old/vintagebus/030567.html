Subject: archives hysteria




 So were are the archives going is it a big secret??

 P &amp; C We do (did) use the archives

 59 DDr w/t w 65 we will keep it a secret interior


 He is very protective of the content and access and we are
 all the better for it.
 Whether anyone likes it or not, Type2_dot_com is better run as
 a dictatorship than like a democracy.  A democracy is nice
 until you try to get a group to make decisions or get
 things done in a timely manner.

 Before you go spouting off wait &amp; see what Hooper has
 planned.  Chances are we will end up with an archive with
 a better design that is easier to navigate &amp; get useful
 information from (no offense).
