I hopped in the 57 standard....drove to the pacific northwest where rubber 
doesnt rot too fast, pulled some nice used bottom pieces out of a junkyard 
bus...ofcourse the felt was wasted.......
I ordered the bulk lengths of the german channels from WW _at_ ~~5$ per foot, I 
peeled the felt off the channels, and used artists spray adhesive, and about 
5 vise grips/wood stichs, and homemade fastening devices to apply it to the 
nice used old rubber bottoms.
Make sure you note that the fronts are different tooo!!!!!!!
They have a notch in the bottom to allow the front of the frame bottom to 
slide into!
HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt; Anyone know a source for the felt channels for the slider and stationary 
door windows??  I know the regular stuff is available everywhere... but I 
have the wider channels as I have the latches that don't go through the glass
