Hey Now!

Forget spiders 'cause everyone's got those.  I'll crawl under the bus to
fill up the tranny and sure enough there will be some webs hanging around.
They seem to like to setup camp for the busses under resto.  My driver on
the other hand has a huge problem with Yellow Jackets! For months on end I
couldn't tell where the hell these things were comin' from.  I'd take the
bus out for a spin and as soon as I got goin' down the road a coupla of
them would pop up and fly over my head.

when we took the 61 m130 deluxe down to Kelley Park in San Jose CA in April, 
every so often a yellowjacket would appear, and buzz around for a while until 
it got shooed out the window.   )  the vent wings are good for this)   I 
figured they were dormant in the bus overwintering, and woke up on the way 
south as it was warmer.   

I was stung by some evil yellowjackets that nested in a 56 deluxe.    Hurt 
real bad for a day or two.
