Subject: Re:  [VB] parcell tray fabric pattern.  Help!
To: mjhenks_at_deltanet_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Can anyone tell me how the fabric on a deluxe parcell tray is supposed
to be cut?  I was trying to figure this out and was not looking forward
to the possibilities.  Is the fabric one piece or cut into a few?
Anyone out there have any good pictures or a pattern they can post me?

Thanks

Matt

Hi Matt, I believe there are two pieces.   One piece is glued to the vertical 
part of  the tray closest to the nose.  The other part is glued to the bottom 
of the tray.  It does not go up on the lip of the tray closest to the seat- 
just on the flat bottom part.  there would be a cut out for the speedo cable 
to go through, of course.   I bet you can make a pattern from  the tray w/ 
much problem.  The grey material (for S&amp;P)  like the bottom/top of the 
interior panels and the sides of the seats is what they used.  It would be 
easiest to paint the tray out of the bus, cut the material to shape, glue it 
one, and then install the tray after you have all the wiring/dash 
switch/wiper motor/radio if you want one  reinstalled.    polish the faces of 
the switches  before installing them, and they look so pretty and shiny 
against your new paint!!!  :)     Sorry, I have no pictures!

Hope this helps.
