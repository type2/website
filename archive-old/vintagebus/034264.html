Subject: Anyone in Idaho heading east?
Message-ID: &lt;58a5ef88.2487079d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a &quot;little&quot; item in Idaho the I am considering purchasing that I will 
need brought to the Midwest.  Will pay $$$ if anyone can help.  If I can't 
find anyone I may have some room available while I am heading east if 
anyone/anything needs a ride.

Please reply off the list.

Thanks,
Dan
