&gt; O.K. WTF is happening?...  I guess I just
&gt; can't stand the idea of seeing F'ing REPO racks going for insane
prices
&gt; at the next swap.  Guess it's not always smart to wait...huh?

I think that if the demand exists, these parts will get made.  I'm
always surprised by the number of people who want to buy my US-made
tubular &quot;dealer accessory&quot; rack.  (Not the fancy wood-slat number)

Makes me wonder if I should tool up and make a few of them myself. 
All that's involved is some tube-bending, tube notching, and brazing
the whole thing up.  It would take two bending jigs, a half-dozen
notching jigs, and an assembly fixture.  Nothing too fancy here.

How much would someone be willing to pay for a full-length &quot;plain
vanilla&quot; rack such as this?  Shorter racks wouldn't be much cheaper to
build, as the labor is about the same.

The real sticking point is how to ship the racks once made.  The size
and shape demand truck shipment, and the packing and shipping cost
would be a significant part of the cost of the rack.  If you're
shipping a quantity it's cheaper, but one at a time will break you.

BTW, one of the best things about my rack is the fact that a 4x8 sheet
of plywood fits it perfectly, and is permanently attached to the rack.
 The shade thus provided on the top of the bus is worth about a 10
degree temperature reduction inside the bus this time of year. 
Nothing to be sniffed at!  The plywood also eliminates a lot of the
noise of wind whistling through the rack.
