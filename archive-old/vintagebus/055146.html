&gt; RGB bearing puller, WHAT a tool. I am going to order one from him $200.00

Hey Ronnie,
Thanks for the info.  Yep I had to get one of these.  It makes it nice.
There is also another collet that you can buy for about $85 that will pull
the top outer on the big-nut trans.  I only have the 6308 collet, still
have to get the other one some day.
Good to see you at B&amp;B, hope to see BBB again, a nice place to warm up in
the middle of January.
