Subject: Re: [VB] Split Bus Campout

Come on now Greg, you don't need a non-VW, a splitty will pull a vintage
tent camper with ease (just giving you a hard time).

I've been finding these little vintage tent trailers around here and getting
them to the splitty people so even the commercial bus people can camp in
style.  If you saw Dan Kinsey's Binz last summer at the Classic, I was the
one who found him the Applebee trailer.

Dan used to have a Puck, but prefers to pull the Applebee because it weighs
less than 300 pounds and has much less wind resistance.  Set up, a vintage
tent camper will have around 35 square feet of floor space and add to that
another 64 square feet of bed space!!  And when you pack the trailer down,
you'll still have plenty of room inside for sleeping bags, clothes duffels
dry goods and ice boxes.

A cool vintage tent camper will make shows and camping easier for anyone and
they look really cool behind our busses.


&gt; The Split Bus Campout North of Fort Bragg this past weekend was great.
&gt; With the exception of the cold, I believe everyone had a good time. I
&gt; took a non-Bus VW and towed one of my tent trailers behind. I ran into a
&gt; Bus list member who was possibly interested in trading my other tent
&gt; trailer for a VW he has. I'll have to contact him, or maybe he'll
&gt; contact me after reading this since I don't have his email (hint hint)
