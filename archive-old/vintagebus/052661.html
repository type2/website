Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet Metal for 65' bus

I've got a Right Rocker in the garage now from Schofileds and a
Rocker/Inner?Cargo Floor section from Motorworks.  Neither one seems to fit
well.  I had to drill the Combo piece apart.  When the Inner Rocker was
adjusted the Outer Rocker was off about 1 and 1/2 inches.  Now with the Set
inplace the door latches have to be move slight towards the front of the
Bus.  When kind of holding the Outer Rocker in place, neither seems to have
the correct &quot;bend&quot; to make the lower door gap.  I see some creative welding
coming into place.

&gt; I replaced my inner and outter rocker with metal from ww and wasn't very
&gt; impressed with the fit/quality. I haven't used any others though so I
&gt; couldn't say how it would compare. I like por-15

&gt;
&gt; Hi All-
&gt;
&gt; I will soon be in the amrket for replacing the passenger side rocker
(under
&gt; the cargo doors)- has anyone used the repro rocker that Wolfsburg West
sells
&gt; and if so what is their opinion on its fit and accuracy?
&gt;
&gt; As well the cargo floors have some surface rust on them. What would be the
&gt; easiest (and hopefully least intrusive) way of attacking this rust?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
