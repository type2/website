Subject: Original bus gearing on 1966 / 1967 Westy ... 4th gear

I wanted to get some opinions from those of you who have studied multiple
books and 

Ronnie and I have discussed how VW did change the transaxle at times... for
example, a westy my have been delivered with different gearing than a single
cab or passenger bus.

Anyway -- What I believe I have as a reference is a 1966 Westy Transaxle.
My turning of the crank and measuring wheel turns reveals numbers that
closely match:

   4th Gear is .82
   R&amp;P is 4.375

Does this sound correct for a 1966?  Was there any change in 1967?

Thanks.
