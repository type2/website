Subject: 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

Greetings All,
A Happy New Year to all (and best thoughts for those in less fortunate circumstances...)
Been a while since I posted on the restoration of Leo, my 62 twin cab so I thought
I&quot;d post a little update (and ask a question)...
About a year ago I started on Leo and here's a pic of what he was like (this
is under the subfloor in the back after I'd taken off the tray). I've posted a couple of
these before ....

Coupla pics of new metal going in

Red letter day when all the under structure, rockers and subfloor was done
and rust-bulleted... (still plenty to do after that - doglegs, lower nose, front pillar bottoms etc etc)
http://www.splitbusaustralia_dot_com/leo_70.jpg
Afetr months of weekends got him rust repaired and the body roughed in.
Spent more months of weekends doing 'final' body and getting him painted
and this is how he was looking last weekend....(colour is mouse grey)

Door fit and gaps are pretty good considering how much I
cut the B pillars around to try and get em right (Leo
was not only rusty but previously accident damaged on both sides...).

Passengers compartment door gap still opens slightly on
the upper rear but I'll live with that. Doors open and shut sweetly.

Mission control so far. I'll put the steering box back in tomorrow
and I've restored a steering wheel (black) with a nice black
deluxe horn push..

And this is why leo is leo.

And for those who have stuck it out this far the question (perhaps
I should have asked this first!).  Is a dual cab headliner sorta three-piece
(ie two pieces beside the overhead vent and one big piece at the back)
or four-piece? (two pieces beside the vent and two pieces at the back -
like a single cab headliner with another extra piece at the back...).
I think it's the second case from memory but can find no pics
and know of no double cab with headliner intact to look at in the short term....
regards
RobK
