Subject: Movie with LOADS of Buses

Just a quick heads up that HBO3 will be replaying &quot;Celebration at Big
Sur&quot; which for about the first 15 minutes shows the line of cars parked
for this thing and it seems like every other vehicle was either a bus or
another bus.  Everything from barndoors, bullet nosed, to early bay
window.  It was filmed in 1969 at Big Sur California.  If you wish to
set your VCRs, my schedule shows that they will be replaying it early
Friday morning (12/18/98). (check your schedule for actual times in your
zone)
