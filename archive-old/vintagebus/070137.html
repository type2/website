&gt; I have a decent sized gap between my sunroof and the roof of my bus,
&gt; what is the best way to seal this gap is there an adjustment?  it's
&gt; coming around to the season where it doesn't matter anymore but I would
&gt; still like to make my bus airtight (or as airtight as possible)
&gt;  Thanks for you help

The adjustment is on the rear of the sunroof. There is a flat strip of metal 
with 8 to 10 screw holes which anchors the fixed end of the sunroof. You 
adjust the tension here by letting out or gathering in more fabric. I hope 
this helps if not I can scan the manual to you.                      Mike
