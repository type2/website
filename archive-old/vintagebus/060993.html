Subject: re:rhino linings

sorry I just read some more on the Rhino forum....it appears as though th=
e
company basically will not back p any installation. It is completely up t=
o the
dealer, so if your installer goes out of business-forget about it. The em=
ails
on the forum-from the company are unbelievable, customer service is a jok=
e.
They refuse to admit their dealer installed a lining incorrectly-and do
nothing to correct, or even help...especially in a very public forum...pl=
us
the tone of their response was rude.

basically it appears that you need to check out how many linings the deal=
er
has done, and actually compare his work....the lining is only as good as =
the
installer.
