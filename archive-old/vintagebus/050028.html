Subject: Pandora: The Road is Long


Previously in these pages, I was struggling with an irksome intermittent
fuel problem (I figure it was) in the 68. I think I have it licked, it
hasn't done it in the past 3 or 4 outings, but I could not assure the
Cruise Director that it wouldn't happen again. So she declared that we must
go to retrieve Pandora in my Dad's Nissan truck rather than the bus. I
agreed to lose that battle in order to win the war...

Chip Shaner signs his email &quot;The Family Man&quot; and he is not kidding,
everything in his life is devoted to his wife and five children (he avers
that they have no intention of stopping at five and there is every reason
to believe him). I admire people who know what they want to harvest from
life and go out and get it; this is such a man. He is young and
enthusiastic and very nice and I want to move next door to him.

But it appears that as the children and obligations multiply, the man of
the Shaner house is forced to divest himself of his mechanical pets, one of
which was this bus. Next to it was a BITCHIN' 1974 Honda 750 in excellent
condition, it's for sale too, the 64 bus is too old to trigger
environmental memories for me but that motorcycle sure smelled good.

It's sort of fun being not quite as responsible as Chip. 8)

He had warned me that we'd need to work on the rear brakes, and we did, and
after we'd fixed them once Saturday night we fixed them again Sunday
morning in the pouring rain, then we fixed them yet again. Laying on your
back on base coarse soaked through with rain is something to forget so I
won't dwell on it.

Observations:

--The thing scats. Chip says it was built pretty carefully and dynamically
balanced and all that, you'd think from looking at it that it was a mother
(chrome 009, chrome power pulley, neener neener neener), but the proof is
on the highway and my it do go. Runs cool. Nice.

--Tracks like it's on rails. I still don't know why VW abandoned the link
pin suspension. This is the second splitty I've driven with a fresh front
end and 4000 lbs just cannot handle like this but they do. Although after
400 miles all this firmness takes it out of my skinny redneck butt.

--It sure is loud and the deplorable Monza exhaust don't help. That thing
has to go.

--JOSH: I am convinced this is an American conversion. The sink says
Campmobile but it doesn't match the rest of the bus. It's a converted
panel, crank-out windows w/separate individual gutters. Westyish coat
cabinet with a mirror on the door. Woodwork is not Baltic birch, appears to
be 1/8&quot; ash ply. Cab interior is painted white but aft is grey primer where
paint is exposed. Z-bed. Conversion upholstery is in a ghastly embossed red
vinyl, you have to see it to believe it. Overall the cheese factor is
around 8.5, it is not low. 8) Attached step does not fit into the jack
points, it is affixed with bolts and is permanent. There are two whatsits
on the roof that seem to have had something to do with an awning, no longer
extant. No evidence of drilling to accomodate a child's cot but conspicuous
room (not occupied) on top of the coat cabinet. There is some evidence that
there was a ladder on the pass side.

--Photos coming, more later.
