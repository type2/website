Hi Dave,
Well if your case savers are pulling out then you will have to go to case
savers with a bigger outer diameter.  Due to the 1953?-79 type I case was made
out of a aluminuim and magnesium alloy that softens when the VWAC engine
overheats.  VW finally made the type IV engine case out of straight aluminuim
which is harder and does not soften from ACVW engine overheating.  If after
you install the bigger case savers and the heads continue to loosen
relentlessly.  Then it is just time to go new or rebuild another engine case
and send your old case off to the recyclers.
