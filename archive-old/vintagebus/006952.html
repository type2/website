I have had a few Phish heads repair/live at my shop on and off the last few
years and have not had a problem, as a matter of fact one Said Phish Head
bus blew up with a brand new GEX engine and while waiting for repairs lived
in his bus behind my shop and went to work for me stripping and cleaning the
yard, this was work that I couldn't pay any locals to do (beyond their scope
of work) and he busted butt to help me out! These so called HIPPIES are some
of the best none arrogant people I have met here at the shop. Some of the
BUSSERS that have come in for repairs, while on the road, were in a rush,
arrogant or beyond friendly as I was just the bum f#_at_k hick town VW mechanic
that didn't meet there hospital clean expectations of the shop in there
hootsy tootsie smog filled CITY that they were traveling from in there
professionally done bus that is on it's first and only road trip. My hat off
to AIRS and the help it has brought, but yes I agree it shouldn't have been
publicized in a major mag , as the spamming will begin and other unwanted
things, I will leave all my info up, but if it was home/personally I would
take off all information except my phone so unwanted people wouldn't show up
at my doorstep at 3 in the morning. I have come to the shop in the morning
and found people camped in my back lot that were towed in, even been called
at home at 4 in the morning by the police when they found a camper in my
drive with the pop top up.


Ronnie    just my experience

&gt; &gt;In the new 12-2000 VW Trends, ...  go into What
&gt; &gt;A.I.R.S. is and direct you to the website encouraging people
&gt; &gt;traveling in VW's to download the contact info. There it is.....

&gt; table and crash in the yard??? We'll make some beans for you!&quot;

Because of course, we only want to help the cool, special people with VW's.
We
would never want to help any of those nasty hippies, just because they
happen
to drive a bus. We only want to help the few privileged people with busses
that
happen to be on the internet, and be cool. As I recall the young lady who
unfortunately lost her life only learned of A.I.R.S. from someone she met in
person, and was in fact, the same type of person against which people so
often
speak here on the list, traveling with dogs, etc.
 I get tired of the anti-hippie bus sentiment I see here a lot. I have been
to
many Dead, Phish, and other touring-type shows. When I got my first bus, I
didn't know a thing about it. Yes, I even broke down in New Mexico, and
through
NEATO got hooked up with a great person who helped us tremendously with the
bus. But, we also went out of our way to be good guests, and did cook dinner
(not beans), and were very grateful. Now I have built engines, and even
busses,
from the ground up.  Sure people do dumb things to their busses if they
don't
know better, but that's not limited to hippies, or any other group of
people. I
have helped a lot of hippies with bus problems at shows. I have also helped
any
other person I've seen in automotive distress when I could help, be they
young,
old, rich, poor, driving a VW or even (gasp) some other brand of car.
Let's not be so selective in the people we help. Or, speaking as a hippie,
&quot;Share the Love, man&quot;
sorry for the rant...
