Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; According to Thom's website (www.vintagebus_dot_com), the last year of the
&gt; semaphore was in 1956.  Is it possible that this is for models to a
&gt; certain location.  
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; A Hill


Hi 

I also have a 59 with semaphores. In australia I think that semaphores came out up till 60-61 I have seen them on a 60 single cab. So it does depend on which specs it was made to.

see ya
