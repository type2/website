&gt; The other thing I don't think anyone has mentioned is the
&gt; speed governor that should be between the carb and the intake
&gt; on transporters. Does anyone have experience with them?

I have one on my '65 camper that works very well....................I
unfortunately found this out while driving it home to Nor Cal from Oregon
over the Siskiyous. Somewhere around Mt. Shasta I finally gave in and took it
off. Much better WOT response now!!
