I just bought two sets (four total) at Harbor Freight. Their normal price
of $80 per set was at $44 per set. I thought that was a good deal. You can
check their website http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/ to see if the del is
there too.

But, I agree with others...either air down temporarily or if you're on 15&quot;
(or 16&quot;) rims, swap to a cheapy pair of 14s to get it in.

Congrats on having a space to work in though!
