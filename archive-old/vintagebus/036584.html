Subject: re;Re: [VB] Powder Coating a Carb?/BBB IV
Message-ID: &lt;83tep6$7j4f_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

the artical on powder coating carbs was in reference to FAST FREDDYS
(weber supplier) and OLYMPIC POWDER COATING, both in santa ana, cal.
fast freddys helped develope the process (they made all the caps and
plugs)
and olympic does the process. They have been doing this for over 15
years.
OLYMPIC POWDER COATING is an awesome place, and have been around as
long as i can remember, they are 1 of the few to pre cook a part before
coating
remember the part is heated to 400 degrees, ouch. they have been doing
stuff for me as long as my mind lets me remember, ps, and they also
blast the part
(included in price), they have at least 300 colors available and also
have
day glo and metalics (also uv clear),

PS, the LONDON BRIDGE BULLIS are looking for donations for our raffle
at 
BBB IV, proceeds from this raffle go to ABUSED CHILDRENS HOME of AZ.
and without the support of the bus community, vendors and privites this 
would not be possable. LAST year we raised $2200.00 for this charity,
which helped make for a lot of happy children, so if you have something
bus or child related you would like to donate for this worthy cause
