was writ:


I am pulling a 36hp from a 59 single cab.  The bottom 2 motor nuts came
off with no problem.  The top is missing one of the studs and nuts all
together, so that was an easy one, but the one on the passenger side
seems to be stripped.  As I turn the nut the stud turns right with it. 
What do I do?????

 upper left

put a vise grip on the nut in the engine compartment

take a ratchet, a long and short extension, and a 17mm socket, and go under 
the bs and undo the bolt from underneath.   you need all those extension to 
reach past the starter.   Reach upper with one hand to feel the bolt head- 
you need to be in a certain position I can't explain to do this, and 
hopefully you can find it.   Kinda like Twister, you know.
