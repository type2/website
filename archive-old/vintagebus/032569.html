Subject: Re: [VB] Dumb fuel filter question

[...]  on my vehicles i run one before and one after the pump.  if running
an electric fuel pump, as some of you do, it is highly recommended to run
one before it, as not to get crud in the moving parts.  i don't use an
electric pump by the way.  i get particles in both filters, too, but alot
more and bigger pieces (rust) in the first one (before the pump). please
use hose clamps, especially on the &quot;blow&quot; side (after pump).


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Me, personally, I prefer to put it on the &quot;suction&quot; side of the pump - 
&gt; ie before the pump.  This reduced the chances of it getting blown apart
&gt; and catching your engine on fire.  This has been a topic of much
discussion,
&gt; pitting the 'suckers' vs the 'blowers' against each other in fiery debate.

 On the beetle the filter is on the fuel line between the fuel pump and the
carb, however, on the bus it is located on the fuel line between the tank
and the fuel pump BEFORE the line enters the fuel pump.  Which of these is
right\wrong.  My bet is that it goes AFTER the fuel pump BEFORE the carb,
but I want to be sure.
