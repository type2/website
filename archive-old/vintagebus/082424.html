Hi Volks,
To make that a bit clearer.  To one of the studs welded to the body  that the 
tranny nose cone mount goes onto, and the other end bolted to one  of the 
studs that bolts the nose cone to the tranny gear box.
  Without the tranny grounding strap the rubber in the three  tranny mounts 
insulates the tranny/engine and grounding is sporadic and/or tends  to be 
fraught with resistance trying to ground through the moving axles and  gas/clutch 
cables.
