Hi all,

Seeing how it is Friday, I figured it would be Ok to just say thanks to all
who replied.  I'm going to look at the engine this weekend.  I'll post the
results of the excursion next week and let everybody know what I find.  If
anybody needs a condensed version of a used engine inspection, compiled from
what everybody emailed me let me know and I'll put it together. Anyways,
Thanks to all who gave me pointers and to the people that make it possible
for us all to be here on the list.

Thanks,
Aaron
