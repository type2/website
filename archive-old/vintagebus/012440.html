&gt; &gt; Hmm.  Anyone wanna write a &quot;VW's for Dummies&quot; book?

I think that John Muir already did, inventing a whole new genre of
books in the process.

BTW, I enjoyed several other titles from John Muir Publications.  &quot;The
People's Guide to Mexico&quot; and &quot;The People's Guide to Camping in
Mexico&quot; are great reads.  Both books are the most honest and factual
guides to Mexico from the non-resort point of view that you will find.
 The &quot;Maria de la Luz&quot; chapter is worth the price of admission by
itself!  These books also have info on bus camping and maintainance in
Mexico.
