This is very similar to my repair although I use an epoxy &quot;clay&quot;.  This 
worked extremely well on my bug's steering wheel which, after the 
sanding/buffing, is painted with a hardened automotive paint... so far it 
seems to hold up.

&gt;WuFuLu_at_iowatelecom_dot_net wrote I plan in filling the cracks on my bus with 
&gt;epoxy mixed with a
&gt;little black powder. the kind you can get from Stewart McDonald
&gt;http://www.stewmac_dot_com/catalog/1.asp?name3=Fresco_Powdered_Pigments  &gt;With 
&gt;this stuff you can fill the cracks on your steering wheel
&gt;just fine.
