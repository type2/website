&gt; HEY! You guys need to add NAMES to those busses - there were some beauts

I'm planning on it when I get the chance.  I took more photos than I
realized and still didn't get everyone's bus on there.  Taking the pictures
was a lot of work but absolute fun.  It netted me numerous trips to Ronnie's
shop as well. :-)  I love that place - it almost feels like some kind of VW
heaven.  I don't know all the owners of all the buses in the photos.  Matter
of fact, you have to sacrifice some of your socializing and mingling when
you are a photographer but it was all in the name of trying to portray how
cool the event was to everyone on the list.  I was honored to be the
unofficial photographer and am still just totally blown away by how cool the
event was and how Rob and I were treated like we were good old buddies from
way back when.  In a way, we are.
