&lt;&lt; Eric, 
 Just went and got a oil temp sender from a FLAPS and didn't look too closely 
at
 the terminal end.  To my surprise it was not a spade terminal but a weird 
looking round top with a conical shaped middle.  It looks like a child's toy 
top.  Any idea how to wire this up?  Do you solder the wire to the sender? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
A real shocker is it not!  Do not worry you are just not looking at the 
problem the correct way.  Take the female spade connector in hand and with 
the side that has the two curled and the center slot on it will face downward 
toward the sender.  Then slid the female connector onto the side of that toy 
top protrubance.  Voilla!  Eric&amp;Barb
