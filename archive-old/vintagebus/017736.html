Charles, 

A few comments and questions on your posts:

&gt; Well, I'm new to the list. And I'm sorry this is my
&gt; first post. But this
&gt; thread sparks some fuel in the fire (okay, pun
&gt; intended).  I personally work
&gt; in the oil field. And when oil is above $30 a barrel
&gt; (42 gallons), I work a
&gt; lot.  Presently I am working so much, my wife is
&gt; complaining (buy hey, I
&gt; need the money to support my VW habit right?). When
&gt; oil is less than that,
&gt; the whole oil field suffers.  

Let me ask a question. Why do you work more when oil
is more expensive? I think the answer is this: that
the oil companies see that oil is expensive, and allow
you to produce more until the price starts to fall.
When the price falls, they slow down production, so
you work less. This is exactly backwards from what
makes good economics in the long run. If they allowed
production to continue at a normal rate, you would
still work a lot, and would have more money in your
pockets to buy more VW's, and thus, you would buy more
gasoline, therefore increasing demand, and increasing
prices.. Eventually, the price would stabilize at a
mutually beneficial and sustainable level. 

&gt; It may be nice to
&gt; those soccer moms that want
&gt; to drive the family SUV on the cheap, but people
&gt; need to realize what is
&gt; happening to the nation as a WHOLE when gas prices
&gt; are cheap.  

Prosperity happens when gas is cheap, but only if the
free market is allowed to work correctly. If you're
not spending so much on gas, you are likely to buy
that SUV, because gas isn't so expensive. By doing
this, you create a greater demand for gas, and the
price will rise by itself. Also, in regards to the gas
station attendants, oil workers, and all the other
personnel effected by the oil industry, if demand
rises, they will be busier, thus earning more money,
and the oil companies will create more jobs, thus
employing more people, who will then become consumers
of goods themselves. 

&gt; Now I'm not
&gt; saying fuel should be
&gt; expensive, I'm just saying that it's a natural
&gt; resource and price reflects
&gt; that.  

Yes, oil is a non-renewable resource. However, cartels
and their price-fixing, combined with overtaxing by
governments who are trying to discourage the internal
combustion engine, has created a false economy in this
arena, thus assuring the long-term failure of the
industry.
