I hate to spam the list with a blatent attempt such as this to peddle our 
wares, but the time has come to part with our Kombi.  It's been on eBay for 
the past week and is only at $200.  I hope we've done an adequate job of 
describing it.  Take a look.  Ask if you have any questions.  I dont think 
reserve's going to be met but like we said in the ad, go ahead and bid, we're 
willing to entertain serious offers on it.

We'd LOVE to see this bus go to someone who can get it back on the road.  
It's not *that* far from being there right now.  I'd almost offer it to that 
fruit who's cutting up the 59 double door for his V8 whatever project, but 
he'll only cut up rust free buses and ours has some rust..........&lt;sigh&gt; oh 
well.
