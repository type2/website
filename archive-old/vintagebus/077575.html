Subject: Re: [VB] faux flip top westy

i had a flip top roof section for sale last year and must have had a dozen people in 
2 days want to buy it.  so i am sure folks are doing it!  at least it would be age 
appropriate on a 64 usually one of the last years although there are later ones also 
not just common.

&gt; 	Is there anyone out there has made a standard bus into a flip top westy?
&gt; Anyone heard of this? Would it be hard to do and make it look fairly correct?     Im also open to peoples thoughts on how this is just another cutting up of buses etc. I would be doing it on a ratty 64 standard just FYI for those who might fear I would cut up an original or early bus.
