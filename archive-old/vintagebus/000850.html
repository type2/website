Hello All,
		I just got back from a killer 2 day VW show in central FL.  The Bulli
Brigade w/ all split busses &amp; the Bug Jam 98', on Sunday.  I Acquired a much
desired 1/3rd length steel roof rack in great shape.  My question is Where
to find a set of horseshoe clamps for it? I've heard they were repro'd, but
how do you explain which your rack is?  The bases of the feet of the rack
are just over 1&quot; wide and taper to flat as they  reach the &quot;T&quot; foot.  The
eyelet for the bolt is approximately 4.5&quot; from the &quot;top&quot; of the &quot;T&quot; foot.
Does anyone have an extra set  (I know this is funny) laying around they
want to sell?  Or have any ideas where to get/fabricate them from?? Any help
much obliged.
