&lt;Matt and Katie wrote&gt; We 
also found Axle (sp?) from Germany, who had more NOS parts in boxes than I've 
ever seen at one swap space.  While others were throwing out hundreds (even 
thousands for a few) of dollars, we spent a meager $35 and got a brand new 
German front hood seal for the notchback.&lt;&gt;

I have decided Axle is the best business man I know.  He realized he had all the same stuff all the others in Germany at Bad Camberg had and showed up a week earlier at the Classic (to take all my money) and was able to get 3 times the German price for things since there was no competition and we all still had our life savings in our pockets.  He then sat home and drank beer and counted his money during the bad Camberg meet I bet :)  Oh well, I wouldn't have had room for it on the plane anyway.  What a shrewd business man.

met Harry, who bought the first round.&lt;&gt;

Thanks Harry!

It must have been quite a site seeing a multicolored, super rusty bus with a 
light-up neon VW emblem on the front coming toward you with Matt standing up 
out of the ragtop looking for clues.  : )  Anyway, we had a blast on the 
rally and only had to double back a few times to find things we completely 
missed.  We stuck around at the restaurant the rally ends at until about 
10:00 PM, and boy are we glad we did, because we came in 2nd place!!  We got 
a really cool plaque with a Berg shifter knob on it.&lt;&gt;


Thanks guys!  You did great.  Next year if we see that last set of Christmas lights we'll get a perfect score.  A funny thing, well it was kind of funny in retrospect, well not really, actually it sorta sucked, but anyway, when you do the Berg Rally they take your drivers licence and put it in an envelope.  I remeber at the end thinking, should I put that back in my wallet now or later.  Made the mistake of  saying later.  
Jump ahead to Monday.  I barely make it to my house in Arizona after the barndoor caravan from California in time to have Everett B. drive me in his barndoor to the airport and I get there 1/2 before my plane leaves.  They throw me on the plane as it heads down the runway.  I land in Germany and go to rent a car.  No VWs.  Bummer.  Gotta go for an Opel.  What is the first thing they ask for?  Drivers licence.  A quick look at my wallet reminds me that the little Gene Berg envelope is still on the package tray of the Rustybus.  Talk about stress and dispare.  Can't exactly fly home and get it and the only plan or reservation I had made for the whole trip was the car. I beg them to let me get the car anyway.  Nope.  Finally I ask if I can have it faxed.  Sure, but the local police department must fax it.  I try to call home.  No one I know is home and the only other number I have I can't call collect and my calling card isn't working.  The rental car lady gives me a phone card b!
ut I can't get the dialing sequence right and the German recording wasn't giving me much help.  I finally reach someone who promises to have a friend(my boss) fax the licence to me.  Unfortunately the rental car place has just closed so I have to wait until morning.  I sleep on a bench in the airport hamburger place.  I am waiting at the door when the rental car place opens in the morning.  No fax.  Bummer.  Call and find that my friend called the cops and they said they wouldn't fax it so she went to bed.  Luckily the new rental car lady was able to tell me to dial 001, not 011, to call the US.  I called a computer savvy coworker who got the same response from the police.  He was a bit more clever than that and got my drivers licence from the bus, set his fax machine up to read Mesa P.D. (hey, he didn't even have to lie and put police) and faxed off my totally illegible licence.  The woman couldn't read it and didn't believe me when I told her it expired in 2031 (&quot;It can't be!
 more than 5 years&quot; she said).  But she finally let me rent the ca
ittle bit (if spending the first 2 days of your vacation in an airport can ever be in your favor) because I was able to rent a black sunroof VW Polo rather than the Opel.  Not a bus, but at least it had the right emblem on the front.  Finally headed off for my German bus adventure.  I'll leave the rest for another Friday if anyone is interested.

If you made it this far congratulations and thanks for reading.  
Richard
