Subject: Odd sound from carb.

This morning I fired up the 66 to drive to work. It started just fine, 
but idled higher than normal as well as an obvious loud sound from the 
3/4 cyls. I could find nothing wrong so I took it easy and drove into 
work. No issues other than the idle and sound. A quick summery:

1600 upright w/ dual Dellorto carbs
operates fine with normal power
Temps seem normal (both head temp and observation)
Sound from 3/4 carb that sounds like a rush of air and 'seems' to go 		 
away off idle a bit.

I have checked the valves and find that they are a bit off but not over 
or under by more than .002. This quick valve check was just to verify 
nothing way amiss and the engine was still barely warm so after the 
engine cools down to stone cold I will actually set/check the valves at 
.006. The sound is kinda like an intake leak, but much louder and if it 
is only causes a increase idle speed, not a decreased one as I am used 
to seeing. I have not confirmed that it isn't a leak though. Any 
thoughts or suggestions?
