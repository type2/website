Subject: re wont cold idle

bit fast, maybe 1000 rpm) So it is occillating idle. My electric choke is non
&gt; functional, but if I run back and manually adjust the stair step choke
Andy said:

bingo. fix the choke first.
could also be icing, i dont know how the weather is where you are.
if its icing unblocking the risers and hooking up preheat hose is a
solution.

Don't think it's the choke, cuz if I manually goose it, the problem still
persists.

Icing hmmmm?  I have the crappy paper air filter.  What is involved with
&quot;pre-heating&quot; set-up.

Weathers cold.  Colorado winter.  have had this problem anytime under 60
degrees though.  Warmer the weather, the quicker the warm up happens.  Once
warm, idles fine...

Thanks!
Wes
