Subject: Day 4, 5  of  2nd field bus revival 

 Day something... it's all a blur on the 5 Day resto.   
Lind thinks we should do this to more buses.  I am not sure if he is farking nuts, or we all are.  It's a pain in the doing, but in restrospect nice to have just blasted through it.
 
Brakes are all new, shocks etc... and some steering components.   So quick to write that.
 
The 40hp motor in the bus turned out to have not only excessive end play, but that front main bearing had visible movement which eliminated it as a road trip prospect.  A 1500 was scared up, which is more correct anyway for the bus, though it'll sport a 40hp air cleaner instead of the left 1500 one which was not handy.   
 
 Bus drives under its own power... new window seals installed. Electrics work except for turn signals... rear lights very bright after they were cleaned up.  Horn loud!!!!   I love these Idaho buses with shiny bright work and mirror like finish inside the taillight housing.   Severe dust layers over the speedo leave it protected from the UV and looking like new.   The bus was washed again, and reveals more metal and paint still extant than I am used to.   The felts for the front door glass are going in today, but I am heading back to WA in the shiny green/white 65 westy.
