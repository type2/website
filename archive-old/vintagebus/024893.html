Just wondering I am think about buying a delux model 65 but haven't gone
to see it yet. My question is does it have a bench or is it a walkthru?
I had a 65 delux at my house once and it was a walkthru. Was it standard
for the 65 delux to have walkthru only? I hope this one has a bench. Any
65 bus historians out there?
Bryan
