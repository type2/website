[...] heat helps, as suggested. also try a centerpunch to start flaring the
rivet and then a normal 2mm or 3mm punch to finish flaring it.  just be
sure to have the round head of the rivet supported with the factory tool
(which i've seen for sale alot on ebay lately), or a bolt of the correct
length.  2 people does make it alot easier.  be sure you trust them and
they trust you, 'cause a flying hammer hurts, but you know that.

&gt; OK, I just spent an hour trying put hub cap retaining clips on one wheel,
how in the H#LL do you do this (1970 &amp; earlier 5 lug wide pattern wheels)??
I was trying to pound the little rivot flat on the back that holds the clip
and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  Anybody have any tips they'd
like to share???
