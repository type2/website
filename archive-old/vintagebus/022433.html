I'm sure I will also, I didn't mean to send it at all yet.  My apologies to
everyone, but that's ok, I hope, since I'd rather have a bus anyway.  The
basic question is still the same tho' where, or is there, an online
resource for prices for older VW's

&gt;Hi Mark,
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure you got yelled at for posting this to a bus list!
&gt;
&gt;Rust rust rust rust and location are what matters.  Where are you?  How bad
&gt;is the rust?
&gt;
&gt;Engines are easy to fix.  Good quality rust repair and paint is expensive...
&gt;
&gt;Good luck.
