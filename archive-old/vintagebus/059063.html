Those could be the tabs for the spring steel wire that holds the actual bulb
in place.

So I guess I should really look at what I have before I start asking
questions.  The PO said they were NOS Hella lights and they are.  The 2
prong,3 prong debate was mostly wrong on my part.  The bulb that fits in the
bucket is a 3 prong so that just plugs in.  But on the bucket, where the
bulb fits in there's 2 additional electrical connections.  At least thats
what I beleive them to be. They're shaped like an &quot;L&quot; and overlapp each
other.  MAybe I'll bring them to BYOB and see if someone can help?
