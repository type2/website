Subject: speaking of tires

Does anyone know when redline tires were available?

In my quest to date my 59 doublecab custom to as early of a date as
possible, it's looking like the mid 60's is where it will be due to the
American racing wheels (and the fact I don't really like the early porsche
carrera wheels).  Accordingly, weren't redlines the 'in thing' at about that
time?

Also, who besides Coker would one go to to get some?
