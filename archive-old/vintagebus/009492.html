If you really want to know the shortcomings of a rear swing axle setup, find
a few photos of early Beetles cornering hard in a road race.  [Early
Spitfires, too, for that matter.]  Yes, VW Beetles were actively raced in
&quot;the good old days&quot; and were quite popular with drivers and spectators
alike.

Swing axle rear suspensions give wide variations in camber angle during
brisk cornering and/or evasive maneuvers.  At some point the rear end will
jack up so high, and the outside wheel tuck so far under, that the vehicle
can literally trip over it's own suspension.  At that point the Beetle,
etc., &quot;fall down go boom&quot;.....

The classic single-car accident in a swing-axle Beetle [or any other early
swing-axle, rear-engined &quot;funny little furrin' car&quot;] occurs when the driver
brakes hard and cranks the steering wheel hard over.  The rearend jacks up,
the outside _front_ wheel tucks under, and the combination of momentum and
large rear weight bias forces the vehicle into a modified &quot;shoulder roll&quot;.
And once it starts to go there is no recovery - matters are completely
beyond the driver's control.

OBC:  All this also applies to swing-axle rear suspension VW
buses/transporters.  Although their design is such that the driver is less
likely to get into really hard cornering, etc., it can still happen.  Next
time you encounter a rolled splitty in a wrecking yard [oops, &quot;recycling
facility&quot;] take a good look at the location and nature of the damage and
&quot;listen&quot; to what it tells you.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  As someone who has driven both kinds of rear suspension, I know why.
The IRS (double jointed) rear suspension is much more stable when going
around bumpy corners.  A side load on a swing-axle (single jointed) car
applies an upward force to the transmission, raising the center of gravity.
The IRS setup does not
suffer from this fault.

After driving the IRS bug, our swing-axle squareback seemed to be picking a
new direction every time it hit a bump.  &lt;&lt;
