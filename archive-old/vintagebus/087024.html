Subject: Re: [VB] questions about selling a bus internationally

Never sold a bus internationally to an individual. I do business with a 
couple of industrial companies and never had any problem with wire transfers 
of funds. Of course there is a lot of trust between myself and my customers.

I would go for the wire transfer method. Make sure all the funds are in your 
hands before title is transfered. Again as with all business deals, trust is 
key. Work as honestly and forthrightly as you can. Hope your customer will 
do the same.

Best of luck.
BTW, nice lookin' ride!!

Chris
