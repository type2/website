&gt; Hello everyone, I just replaced all the wheel cylinders and brake hardware
&gt; including the shoes but my front passenger side cries out in a high
pitched
&gt; shrill voice when I brake fairly hard at the end of a stop. I removed the
&gt; hub and found some very shiny areas on the new shoes towards the ends of
&gt; them.

Sounds like the radius of the shoes doesn't match the radius of the drum.
Back when everybody had drum brakes, they used to 'arc' the shoes (grind
them to match the drum). Now, it seems, we just let them wear in.
