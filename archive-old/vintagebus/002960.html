Not on ebay. not extremely rare. Not $45,000 or even $3000 for that matter.
I picked this up thinking I would either turn it into my daily driver or
take the rebuilt motor and aftermarket trans out and part the rest out. I
can't bring myself to do that because it is such a nice original bus(aside
from motor and trans). All it is missing is rear bumper and shift knob.
Still has shifter extension, clock, jail bars, cargo step, etc.... Runs
great. Still 6 volt. Headlights work. Wipers work. Dome lights work. Even
the horn works through the steerign column!!!!! I have all the orignal
paperwork for this. And there is alot of it! Even the original owners id
card. Very nice stuff. It was bought originally in Augusta GA and that is
where it still is. It could be used for a daily driver or a nice resto
candidate. It does have usual bus rust. Nothing too bad IMO. Please check
out the pics and let me know what you think. I am asking $2000 or trade for
it. Thanks for reading!!!
