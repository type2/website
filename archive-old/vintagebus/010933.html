I have been asking myself why the 1967 model year had so many parts that were 
only 1967. Having recently aquired a new-2-me '67 Westy and unloaded a '67 
parts Westy I made every attempt to remove swap out parts that I thought were 
'67 only.
Can the &quot;List&quot; give me an understanding of which parts are '67 only. Also I 
work at 1 of the Big 3 as a production supervisor and can only think that the 
reason that the parts were '67 only was that a parts redesign was needed 
because of faulty design, safety improvement or a cost savings. Either way, 
any parts change whether it be on the chasis line, trim line or motor line is 
a major logistic, labor and scheduling headache. 

Always listening, always willing to learn.
