Subject: Re: [VB] Bosch 021 distributers timing question?

It is unlikely you can pull the driveshaft with the spring. If you
have no access to the tool, you can get it with a reverse plier, one
where the tip expands rather than contracts when you squeeze the
handles.

 Hi John,
 
   Thanx's for the reply, I didn't think about the delay on #3.  As for the
 Distributor Drive Shaft Index, you must be talking about taking the drive
 shaft and washers out and reversing the drive shafts position.  I found
 removing the distributor drive shaft very difficult last time I tried
 (don't have the expanding tool, but mine may be easier cause I can see the
 spring and maybe able to pull that out that way?
 
 Best,
 joe
