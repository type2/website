&lt;&lt; the 63 I got not too long ago was made March 5 I believe...4 or 5 days 
after they started pressing the engine vents outward instead of inward.  It 
has a small nut trans.  Should it have 15&quot; rims?&gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Correct!

&lt;&lt; the small nut trans's from 55 on should have 15&quot; rims right?&gt;&gt;
As long as it was not a M215 model.

 &lt;&lt; I thought they changed everything (rear hatch, rims, trans, door handles
 etc) for the 64's.  &gt;&gt;
No.  There were all sorts of changes from about spring of 63 to NOV63.
