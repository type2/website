Question: Once sludge gets in your engine, how do you get it out. My oil 
filler on my type 1 engine is filled with a pudding like sludge from the 
engine not warming up enough in the cold weather.  I am working on fitting a 
thermostat.  In the meantime I will change the oil to clean it up as much as 
possible.
