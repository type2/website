&gt; My theory is that the leverage of the ebrake system causes

&gt; 
&gt; You could also adjust the brakes and back that shoe off a tad, to even
&gt; it out, but there would be no way to validate your adjustment.

&gt; definitely the way to get max life out of them.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my odd brake shoe wear dilemma. I have
checked the operation of the e brake cables, the wheel cylinders, the return
springs and whether the shoes contact the backing plate. Everything checked
out fine.

I am therefore going to assume that the mach who did my front end rebuild,
or one of his assistants, drove my bus with the e brake up and then
readjusted the shoes to hide the fact. Shoes so far out of whack I would
have noticed as there was about five full turns more adjustment on the e
braked shoes than on the others. I would simply not have bothered adjusting
shoes out that far as I don't believe its safe as the thread of the adjuster
is then not completely supported in the star.

I'm getting a set of shoes relined to match the drums(if the drums need it
they will be trued) at the moment and as soon as they get back from the shop
I will reassemble and test them out. 

On another note I saw a very cool bay window camper conversion with a
matching tent and trailer that the local VW restorer/scrap yard guy just
bought from a couple in their eighties. These campers were done by a
caravan/camper company in SA called Jurgens and they consisted of the cab
section of the bay bus with a small aluminium caravan built onto the back.
There is a picture of one in the Meredith Custom bus book. They are not
super good looking but they have bags of space.

This one has 17 000 km on the clock. Thats around 10 000 miles and it is
complete and original in every possible respect. It has the original
handbook which includes a checklist of camper parts and everything is there.
It has been garaged for the last 10 years and driven around the block once
or twice a month by the owner to keep it from deteriorating.

Later
