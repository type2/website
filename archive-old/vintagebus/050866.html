&gt; I recently picked up a set of bus rims here but am having a difficult time 
&gt; finding any part numbers on them... 'course they are in immaculate

&gt; edge, inner?  Thanks troops

Hi Shedberg,
As of yet we have not found any stamped part number on them.  You have to go 
by measurement and wether crows foot or not for the 15&quot; rims.  When measuring 
diameter on the outer edge it will read 1&quot; larger than the rim is listed as.  
IE a 15&quot; rim will measure 16&quot; diameter.
