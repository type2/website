Hey Gerald,

Depends on the amount of stretching but heating
with an oxy torch will shrink the metal.  Just a spot
at a time.  Very localised, heat to just before
red glow. Allow to cool.  Heat again. Gently with
patience........

If you go to

http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/page6.htm

you'll see where I have use this technique to 'shrink'
some metal (pic on right top)...

If the dint was 'sharp' enough to have 'corners' after
being pulled out you can bash it in and bog it (urk)
or replace the corner (mmmmmmm....)

What do I do for a living?  It's a SECRET!   8-)....





&gt; Dear Metal Wizards......
&gt;
&gt; Well, it worked as usual, but
&gt; now the metal is stretched and the corner is now slightly
&gt; bowed out more that the rest of the body.   My question
&gt; is... how do you get it back in??  I mean, how do you deal
&gt; with stretched metal like this?  Ive been thinking about
&gt; this for about a year now and still havent come up with a
&gt; good idea.  Only thing I can think of is to make a slice in
&gt; it with a metal blade in my skill saw, bring the resulting
&gt; ends back together somehow and then mig weld it.  This way I
&gt; could get rid of some metal.
