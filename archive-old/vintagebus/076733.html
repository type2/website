Subject: Re: [VB] behind the trim panel...

The last time I flew (Post 911) I had my gas key (Church Key) on my key ring
and they wanted to take it away till I explained what it was for!  They also
thought that I had some Allen wrenches cause the batteries in the bottom of
my carry on must of looked like a L shape in the X-ray.  They asked me if I
had some Allen wrenches and I said no and proceeded to empty my carry on
just to find the batteries.  What did they think that I was going to remove
the Pilot door

  The lady at the security
&gt; counter
&gt; was iffy on one thing when i said it was a 'fuel pump' but still let us
on!
&gt; Today you
&gt; would definately be in the back room somewhere getting searched hard and
&gt; deep.
