&lt;was said&gt;Seems like a taylor made way to drop oil all over the motor when
you change the filter....but then I've been told I'm rather messy.&lt;&gt;

My thoughts as well.  I spill enough oil on the filter I have that is upside down, this one would be a nightmare.  Of course then my engine would be equally oily on both sides since I dump oil all over it when I add oil after oil changes.  

Other than that, it doesn't seem like a terible design, although I would hate to cut a perfectly good fan shroud.

my 2 cents,
Richard
