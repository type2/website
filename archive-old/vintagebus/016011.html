Subject:  [VB] and...-61 bus tail light
Date: Mon, 24 Apr 2000 16:02:14 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Just cuious, but does anyone have a -61 tail light lense? I bought a couple 
of boxes of VW parts at the flea market a couple weeks back. In there was a 
set of 61 tail lights. They both had some kind of rod around them that stuck 
down several inches. I dont know if this is normal or not since I have not 
had the chance to own a pre 62 yet (except for my 61 still stuck in AL and 
has aftermarket tail lights). One of the chrom rings is a little pitted and 
the other one is ok. I do need one lense though since one is cracked down 
the middle.

I paid 65 bucks for both boxes, so I THINK I got my moneys worth on just the 
tail lights....or did I ?

&gt; &gt; Ill take all the 52-67 taillights you have at 4.95$ each!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;well,
&gt;
&gt;Busdepot has the lenses for $4.95 each to fit 62-67.. call em up and tell
&gt;em to send all they can get... I'm sure given cash in advance they can get
&gt;you at least a thousand...
&gt;
&gt;Since that was within the range you specified, im sure this will help...
&gt;If you meant pre 62 lenses, those are NLA new... But you DID say 52-67,
&gt;without specifying a year preference, so all the 62-67 lenses you can
&gt;handle should do just fine ;)
&gt;
&gt;take care,
&gt;
&gt;Steve
&gt;
&gt;p.s. just funnin with ya...
