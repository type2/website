Actually, a couple ebay sellers have been doing just that.  They sell
them as &quot;VW barndoor&quot; headlights and you don't know the difference
until you get the box with the mercedes logo.

Mercedes made this bus-looking thing.  It used the exact same headlights.
I can't recall the model of this puppy, but it came in several different 
configurations.  I know of one in Sacramento that's like the &quot;deluxe&quot; 
version, complete with &quot;corner windows&quot;

&gt; There are headlight assemblies used on Merc trucks of the '70s era that
&gt; appear to be an exact match to those on our buses. I checked with a truck

&gt; told me that lenses and seals could be got sepperately. I think I will buy
&gt; up their entire stock, put them up on ebay and retire to the Cayman islands
