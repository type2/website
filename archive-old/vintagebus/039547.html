Happy Friday All!

I got a 66 deluxe hardtop named sprout!  OE sea blue/ cummulous white that 
is now rustoleum flat sage green enamel below the beltline.  Needs lower 
nose (got one in the south east), some floor patching.  Have all ready 
installed rear wheel wells and massaged his but cheeks ;)  Hacked cab 
divider :( (could use that too!) and slightly hacked radio knob holes.  Got 
him w/ a full lengh rear bay seat and home fabed green vinyl paneling.  Put 
a 70 bay z bed in and the side cabinet that I cut at the beltiline.  Looking 
for a nonwalkthru jump seat and table, cabinet above the firewall on the 
roof, and the spice rack and cargo table.  And as mentioned earlier cab 
divider w/ paneling and a lower nose.  Oh yeah Sprout could probably use 
rockers too!
