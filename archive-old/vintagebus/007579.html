OK, I got so caught up in the whole thing that I never even took the camera
outta the bus. I saw lotsa folks taking pictures and even witnessed one
enterprising person climb on top of the bathhouse to take some panoramic
shots of the campout area! I would really like to get some pics so I can
update the website.

I will gladly accept them in digital form or if you mail them to me I will
scan them and mail them back.

Thanks
Chris
