Just go another 40 miles to Lake Havasu and camp in my driveway/side yard. I
am leaving on Thrusday afternoon and camping out on the back road into

Anyone have any recomendations for campgrounds on the AZ/CA border in the
Needles area (Highway 40)? We are looking for a place to rest up on the way
to Jerome on Wednesday night.
