&gt; My name is Ed Fox and as you might know, I got kicked out of last year's
&gt; 
&gt; Classic for having a girl tied to my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; This year I'm doing a better show at my studio in L.A.  Would love if
&gt; you could attended or at least put a link to my site (your events page?)
&gt; so that the people
&gt; can see what they missed.
&gt; 
&gt; go to the link to see a bit more.
&gt; 
&gt; thank you in advance...
