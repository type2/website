Subject: P&amp;C swap

Scraping together some bench motors from parts lying around, on #2, and am 
using pistons and cylinders from one motor on a good used shortblock- my 
question is, should I keep the wristpins with the pistons from the donor 
case, or use the wristpins from the shortblock?  I would think the pins 
should stay with their pistons, but am not sure.
