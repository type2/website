Subject: re: 6 volt to 12 volt inverter

was writ:
&quot;I picked up a couple of Archer (Radio Shack) inverters at the last
VW show for $10 each. 3A, 12V max output, but this would be more
than enough for your gauges. A second one would run a low-powered
radio, but you'd need more for a bigger radio - 3A _at_ 12V is 36W -
if your radio was perfect at converting input energy to output
energy you could have 18Wx2ch but it's not, so plan on more like
6Wx2ch to 10Wx2ch.&quot;
____________________________

My local Radio shack doesn't have any converters. JC Whitney is the only place
i know that has them, athough there is one other electronic store i know of
here in houston that i will try. The JC Whitney inverters cost $90, for a
converter that provides 26.5  watts, 6 volt input 12 volt output.  If I were
to get this type of converter, does that mean the radio I buy should only be a
25 watt/channel radio? i.e. I notice most radios say XX watts per channel, do
i want to match the watts per channel to the converter watts? I  just want to
make sure i understand your answer.  What exactly does that mean 25 watts per
channel...is that 25 watts per speaker(assuming one channel to left speaker,
and one channel to right speaker)
