Subject: [VB] Sacramento Bug-O-Rama/Classic
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

The only thing that I will raise my head out of the
turtle shell to say is that I have been inviting Thom
and separately the old California Camping Crazy crowd
&lt;how many old timers rememeber them?&gt; to the Jerome
Jamboree. Lost contact with the CCC's years ago but
none of the above have ever made it into our fine
State of Arizona for the September event.
Told Thom last night that he is welcomed at the
Arizona  events and my camp site in particular
anytime. ~as long as he shows up!
Me not showing up to the Classic? Hell no!, I have a
'54 Barnambulator to sell. Somebody wise up and buy
this MF &lt;mighty fine&gt; bus and I can be as radical as I
want to pretend to be. In the meantime, I need to get
some cash flow. Am still fending off the spouse on
taking it to the OCTO/Classic or leaving it at home!
In my mind it *has* to be there or be already sold.
