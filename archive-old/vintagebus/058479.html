Subject:  [VB] Oil light puzzle

Why does my oil light stay on?  When I start the DC and the engine is =
cold, the light comes on when I turn the key then stays on as soon as =
the engine starts?  The oil level reads full, and the engine isn't hot.  =
I just had the engine rebuilt, 1904cc, it has an oil sump and an full =
flow oil filter.  Ideas?

Thanks, =20
