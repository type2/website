Well it looks to me like the spacing of the gear teeth like someone put the
engine in or pulled it out slightly off center.  The grinded areas look like
something might have gotten stuck in there at one point or the flywheel just
kind of ground off it's own area.  I wouldn't worry about it, looks nice and
clean to me!
