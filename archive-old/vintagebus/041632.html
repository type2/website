If memory serves, this cap (at least, for my 66.;) is the same as theoil
filler cap.  At least, the same size.  If you wish to use hte much nicer
looking (and vented..) origianl cap, either order a oil cap seal from RMM
or Ron, or whoever, or get one of the oil filler caps they sell at AZ,
pull the seal out, and install it in your old cap.

good luck.

dont even know where hte tank is now..i have my 69 tank in the 66.)

It'll leak if you just poke a hole in the cap.  Ask how i know.  Every
time oyu turn a corner it'll slosh out.
