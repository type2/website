Subject: M-Code 199
Mime-Version: 1.0


I am in the middle of negotiating the purchase of a double-door panel with
the famed mcode 199.  What would this bus be worth &quot;done&quot;

As it is, it has cut wheel wells, mildly dented and rusty nose, rusty
driver's floor, and lots of extraneous holes throughout the bus.  No
engine.  Leaking reduction boxes.  Alleged new brakes.  Had an engine fire
and engine harness is wasted, but the rest of the wiring was new.  No bumpers.

The actuall 199 option was removed at one point, and he has another, but it
too will need work and donor piece before it's functional.

Also, would such an 199 bus have a passenger seat?  Owner claims no, but I
think it looks like it did.  One other pic I have of such a bus does have a
passenger seat.

What it boils down to is this: this would be a cool, unique bus to restore,
but do I really need a *4th* bus?  How rare is the 199 option?  What is the
360 option?  It also has 175.

Thanks!
