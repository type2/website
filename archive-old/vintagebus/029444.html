On the eastern outskirts of Gunnison Co. there is a yard with a few split
busses. That was five years ago, but they may still be there. In Grand Junction
at the Foriegn Aid shop and Don's Automotive there are most likely splits in
the back. Don a great guy and has done lots of VW work for me since I first
started driving. I haven't seen him in two years since I live in Cal. and don't
get out there much. Five years ago Foriegn Aid had a 23 window but needed tons
of work. Check them out.
