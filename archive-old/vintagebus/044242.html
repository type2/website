&gt; One trick that I picked up many years ago is to wrap a shop towel or rag
&gt; around
&gt; my wrist before reaching to disconnect the fuel line from underneath the
car.
&gt; Unless you're slow in plugging the line with a punch or golf tee or
whatever,
&gt; the rag will absorb most or all of the gasoline that otherwise wants to run
&gt; down
&gt; the length of your arm, soaking your shirt, irritating the skin in your
&gt; armpit,
&gt; etc.


This is a great trick, and the thread reminds me of something that happened to
a buddy of mine.  He was changing fuel lines at the VW dealer where we worked
with the car on a lift and a drop light for illumination.  A stream of gas
came
out of the tank and shot onto the hot light bulb.  The bulb cracked open and
ignited the fuel, including that which had soaked into my buddy's clothes! 
Fortunately the well-equipped shop *always* has a charged fire extinguisher so
this was a close call instead of a tragedy -- better to use a flashlight or
other low-heat, unbreakable light source when messing about in pools of
flammable liquids -- and always have an extinguisher handy!
