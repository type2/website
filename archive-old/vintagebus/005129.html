    Thank You Everyone for your help and direction. It sounds like the clear
coat is the way to go unless you have some one around that can anodize parts
for you. I think I am going to clear coat the trim and I also just got back
my Porche Cookie Cutter alloys from the polishing shop and they look great!
I found that Bus Boys carries the adapters for this type of rim and the
offset is about center on a six inch rim so I shouldn't get excessive
bearing wear on my reduction boxes.

Thanks Again!
