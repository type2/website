&gt;
&gt; &gt; If big oil lines are bad, and small oil lines are better, then why not run
&gt; &gt; 1/4&quot; lines, or better yet, 1/8&quot; lines.  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;What is the purpose of small lines in a brake system ???

Not much volume is needed - only pressure.  No advantage (cooling, etc.) 
for increased volume.  In fact, it may be detrimental, since there is more 
fluid to absorb moisture.


&gt;  &gt; Like George said, if you push X amount of oil into one end of the oil
&gt;line,
&gt; &gt; then the exact same amount of oil will come out the other side. Oil line
&gt; &gt; size does NOT change this.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;What goes in must come out&quot;. Einstein ? Dr.Spock ?
