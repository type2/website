&gt; .the reason i ask is mine did not want to move at all last night-it was

&gt; the grease for the gears had gotten too thick...

Hi Kevin,
No special tools needed.  If you have not or the DPO did not replace the 
grease in there it by now has turned into something resembling puddy and will 
come out as a one piece chunk!  Do use a lighter wieght grease such as clear 
lithium, not a thicker axle grease (BTDT!).  We have been thinking of trying 
thinner white lithium grease.  The two main objectives to keep in mind are to 
look carefully for a warpy washer on one of the gear axles inside and make 
sure it gets back there when you reassemble it.  The other is to only fill 
the gear box about 1/4 full, just so part of the gears are in the grease and 
slings it around when it gets warm in there.  Too full of grease results in 
too much friction from churning too much grease around.
