Morning list,

Some of you may have read my rabid rant fest of a post last friday
regarding the shoddy finishing of the body job on my doublecab. Most of
you, I hope, deleted without bothering. Those of you who did read it
will be pleased to hear that I did in fact go out and get stinking drunk
but managed to refrain from shooting any panelbeaters.

I sent the bus back and hopefully it will be completed properly this
time. Judging by the length of time the bus was in the shop originally I
expect it to be in for a month. This will leave precious little time for
testing the rebuilt motor before setting off on a longish trip at the
end of May.

It would therefore make sense to build and then run it on a stand.
Problem is I dont own one and have pretty much run out of budget to buy
one (funds committed to other important stuff like tyres and license
fees etc.) so I would like to weld one up.

Do any of you out there have a plan or failing that some advice on
building one? These little projects always look so simple at the outset
but there are invariably unforseen hitches that have probably been
overcome by someone who has already done the job. Am I barking up the
wrong tree as far as the stand is concerned - can it just be run on a
bench?

TIA
