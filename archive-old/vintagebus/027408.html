&gt; We're driving up Sat. afternoon, but can't camp. Where's a good/convenient Motel 6 or some such? Will peruse the net and post nearby places, let me know soon.

We'll be heading down Saturday as well. I heard about the &quot;no camping&quot; thing. I think they do that every year. But people still seem to hangout around the gate all night. I'll be in my '65 Vert (red) followed by my '65 Crew (brown/tan) and
'65 T34 Ghia (blue). I'm selling as well so the Crew will be loaded with goodies.

If you get a chance find me..................

Greg
