Now that my 58 (not 59, 58 ) bus is off to the panel shop to be done, and
now that I have found it to be old and unusual enough to restore, I realise
that the original reason for getting it has gone the way of all things. NO
daily runner period piece this, there will be no interesting motor, extra
guages,non-stock wheels etc. Let alone a nice old hippie colour/color
scheme. Ah, bugger it I thought.
     A mate said to me yesterday &quot;Theres a bus like yours outside a shed
near..............&quot;
So I went and bought it.
        YES!!
