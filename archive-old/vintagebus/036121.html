 Can anyone help me with some digits ?
 
 25 2
 415 072 119 216
 SN 2233 454480 1255510
 
 ***
 25 2 - 25 Feb manufacted date.
 How about the year ? 
 
 1 - Januar
 What is the right date. Other numbers say 25. Feb and this says Januar
 ?????????
 
 255510 = VIN number, but what does this says ?? Other than the fab. date ?

====================
the number at the lower left is the entire VIN until the 65 model year, yours 
is a 64 by the VIN-  which is 1 255 510- made on 25th Feb 64.  it says yours 
is the 1255510th bus made.
