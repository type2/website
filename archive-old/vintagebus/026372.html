Allright, got to go home this weekend and do some work on the 67 Camper,
but a few questions arose . . . First, the shocks in the rear of the bus
seem to be coil-overs, are they aftermarket? Can I replace them with the
stock shocks that are offered from most mail order places?
    Next, with all the talk of restoring old speakers and using old
radios, I started looking at the AM/FM Blankpunkt I have in mine. Of
course, it is not attached anymore. In the back there is an outlet for
some sort of plug to which the wiring harness attaches. Does anyone have
one of these plugs or knows how to bypass it? Also, can you buy antenna
wire and splice two into one, since I am planning on having another
system in my car, or should I just run two antenna?
    Finally, there is a bunch of wires that comes into my engine
compartment on the left side. One thick red, one green, one brown, and
one more (the color evades me). They were detached by a PO. What are
they for? The camper runs fine, no major electrical problems.
    Thanks for your assistance.

Chris
