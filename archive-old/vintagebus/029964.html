Subject: re: [VB] should I pull my disty?

Hello Rex,

This is the long route, going back to basics... 

Go ahead and pull the dizzy, and see if you can wiggle the shaft
sideways. If so, replace it. You'll never be able to get the points gap
or timing set properly if the shaft has sideways play in it.

Pull both valve covers. Get the crank pulley lined up at TDC. Make sure
you have valve lash on both rockers on #1 (you can measure the lash with
a feeler gauge, or you can just wiggle them and make sure that its
there). If one of the rockers is down, then you need to rotate the crank
pulley 360 degrees, until you get the TDC notch again. Both rockers
should be up. Check the rockers again for lash. 

Put the dizzy back in, make sure that it drops all the way down and is
engaged. Line up the notch in the distributor body with the rotor
button. Put the cap on the dizzy, make sure that the wire that the rotor
button is pointing at is hooked up to #1 spark plug.

Rotate the crank pulley 180 degrees (you have a mark there, right?). The
rotor button will have moved 90 degrees and will be pointing either at
#2 or #4, depending on which way you turned the crank. Whichever wire
the rotor button is pointing at, trace it to the spark plug at that
cylinder, wiggle the rockers and check for valve lash. Repeat until
you've checked all 4 cylinders. Firing order is 1-4-3-2, but you can
check it 1-2-3-4 also, turning the crank in the opposite direction.
Doesn't matter, as long as you have valve lash on whatever cylinder the
rotor button is pointing at.

&lt;&lt;&lt;...The first time I tried doing a valve adjustment (about 20 years
ago), I got confused, turning CW and CCW and losing track of which
rockers I was supposed to adjust (using the Muir bible), and when I went
to crank the engine over, some of the pushrods fell out of the rockers!
So, don't try to adjust for the valve lash unless you are sure both
rockers on that cylinder are up! ;)...&gt;&gt;&gt;

The point of this long exercise? Whichever cylinder the rotor button is
pointing at will have both valves closed, and both rockers should have
lash in them. This will help you get the dizzy and plug wires oriented
the right way, and is a way to check that your valves are not adjusted
too tightly. If you don't have valve lash, you won't have full
compression, and your engine will not run right, if at all.

Now for the fuel problem. If your fuel pump was intended for a fuel
injected engine, it will put way too much fuel pressure on your carb.
The float valve is supposed to regulate the flow of fuel to the bowl, so
you may need to check that, too. I'm not sure that an engine flooded
with raw fuel will start.

Once you've checked all that stuff, your engine should start. You will
have to adjust the timing (max advance is 28-30 degrees at around 2500
rpm).
