Hi all,
	My '62 221 was built on Nov 28, 1961, which was a monday. This
could explain the problems I've had with it (it couldn't be MY
fault)...maybe the person(s) on the assembly line were hung over from
the weekend (or from octoberfest)?
	I found a site that you can look up the day for any year, it is at
http://www.uwm_dot_edu/cgi-bin/corre/calendar
	Maybe this will explain some things for you...&quot;Hans, it's 4:45pm
on Friday! I'm too tired to put the safaries on this one, standard
windshields should be fine!&quot;

Happy Friday,
Todd
'62 standard (Born on Monday, like me!)
