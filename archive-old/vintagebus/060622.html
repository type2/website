&gt; What i mean by weeping is that the solution used to elliminate the rust 
&gt; inside the gates would leak out of the seams slowly.  Even after a year, i 
&gt; still had some
&gt; fluid comming out of the hing area of all 3 gates.  I am hoping to find 
&gt; another way to get the rust out of there.

Hi Volks,
We are plotting to try having our gates, tool bay, and engine lids zinc 
plated or maybe zinc dipped.  Either way the zinc shop acid dips the metal 
till all rust is removed before the zincing.  Eric&amp;Barb
