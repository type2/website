 Ellis understands all of the points that Clara, true
 to form, delineated for us all. True to my tiringly
 smart alecky form, I was just busting the butt of a
 friend and taking the oppty to pimp my under
 appreciated '54 stating that it definitely is in shape
 to make the trip and reinfore it's value/condition to
 a potential buyer. Just doing the sales thing... If I
 still have the bus I just might be driving it (from
 Phoenix) to Solvang and back. It was thought that the
 intended teasing would have been picked up as obvious. &gt;&gt;
