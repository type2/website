Subject: RE: [VB] CE Aluminum Safari's  first impression

  There new aluminum frames are as close to OG as I have seen (better then
there steel). I need to get a set for me and start working on some aluminum
OG style hindges that can be spot welded on.

Hi Ronnie,

Is CE still using the rectangle |_| shape frame or have they gone to the
more v
shaped outer edge like the OG ones?

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt;     I just recieved a set of C E aluminum Safaris for a customer (he
ordered
&gt; direct) and I must say WOW. The frames are absolutly awesome. They are
&gt; extremely rigid, no flex and are DOUBLE WALLED like OG ones. The only
thing
&gt; I don't like are the hindges are SCREWED on instead of welded so you have
&gt; screw heads showing and he hasn' t changed the hindge holes yet so they
&gt; won't bolt up to OG plates.  Overall impression on a scale of 1 to 10 I
&gt; would give them a 8/9.
