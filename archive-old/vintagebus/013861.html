THose are European lights.  A direct bolt-in replacement, but you
have to get the whole assembly, not just the lenses.  And they go
to '71.

&gt; I saw some strange tail lights today.  They were the regular shaped oval
&gt; tail lights of the 64-67 busses, but they had two bulbs.  They were
&gt; mostly red, but the upper (I think) part was amber, like some of the
&gt; more modern tail lights.  They were original looking, and they did say
&gt; &quot;Hella&quot; on them.  Are these original?  BTW, they were installed on a
&gt; green 65 Kombi in a park and ride lot in Davidsonville, MD.  Anyone on
&gt; the list?  Also saw a blue mid 70's loaf in the same parking lot.  Very
&gt; strange for the area...
