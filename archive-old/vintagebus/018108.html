Who said anything about being &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;hate&quot;?
Why must people automatically throw words like that into
a discussion that they don't agree with?  May as well have
gone for the hat trick called him a racist as well...

What rubs some people's hide the wrong way is the yuppie
&quot;boutiquey&quot; wannabussers.  They want a bus for the same
reason people paid premiums for new beetles - the be 
the first on their block with the &quot;kewelst&quot; ride.   Just
like phat-wallet overseas buyers, these guys cause 
prices to rise because they indescrimiatley pay way too
much for cars.  Would deluxe prices be anywhere near
where they are today if yuppies with more dollars than
sense weren't paying $40k+ for them at auctions?   The
same yuppies could get those cars for a lot less, but 
that would take some legwork, which isn't something they
want to do.  

I guess we should give eddie some credit for actually 
getting his butt out to a show and seeing
what's out there, rather than trying to pick one of 
the Robb Report.  FWIW, he hiked out to the OCTO show
and I didn't, but I imagine he lives a lot closer. 
Besides, I was busy laying down some Caltrans Orange
on a friend's bug (http://www.jps_dot_net/tmink/painted.jpg)

&gt; 
&gt; Where have you been? The Volkswagen Transporter is the
&gt; most popular vehicle around.... According to Car and
&gt; Driver, the bus is one of the top 10 most collectible
&gt; vehicles right now.  How will Eddie Van Halen make the
&gt; fun go away??  And what bus community are you in? I'd
&gt; like to stay far away from your unintelligent, hate
&gt; filled community!
