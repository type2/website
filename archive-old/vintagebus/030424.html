I just ran no shocks on the back , I have had the front shocks on the whole time.
Keeping everything greased is not a problem. nothing ever seems to dry out here
so I grease the bus up all of the time. If I don't things freeze up fast. After
living in northern California the weather in texas drives me nuts. I wish I had a
garage.

&gt;  I had been running my bus for about 8 months with no shocks. I had
&gt;  someone tell me that they had removed theirs and that it had handled
&gt;  better. Mine handled fine , but I think it handles a little better on
&gt;  the freeway, but not much different. The shocks I put on were KYB's and
&gt;  I have noticed that all of a sudden I am getting more wear on the
&gt;  outside of my rear tires. Let me know if you find anything to
&gt;  substantiate that.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; the KYB Gas a Just is what you had?   they are too hard, I think so, in my
&gt; opinion.   Get you some GR-2s from KYB,  these are softer and  magically make
&gt; pot holes etc go away.  put shocks on your bus.  better for your suspension.
&gt;   Have you greased your front end recently?  every tune up, or more often if
&gt; you have no shocks.
