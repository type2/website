Hi Everret,
Think we talked to just a while ago about this problem of yours.  What
diameter are your tires?  What did you end up using for a pilot jet size?
What color is the soot in the end of the muffler tail pipe?  Have you checked
the engine oil to see if there is fuel getting into it?  If so and yes, then
check fuel pump rod hieght, next replace the fuel pump and later if no change
go through the carburator replacing part by part.
  We are getting above 24MPG average at the same speeds as yours in our 1960
panel with the same tranny with 27&quot; diameter rear tires.  A 1641cc single
port engine dual relief case 009 distributor set staticly at 7BTDC, 30 PICT-1
carb with 55 pilot, 114 main, and 125 air correction.  Stock 40 HP air
cleaner and 1600 muffler.   Eric&amp;Barb
