&gt;['67 Deluxe] The wiring diagram I picked up at Thom's shows a D+ terminal 
&gt;and a DF terminal on the generator.  Mine, however, has a B+ terminal and
&gt;a D+ terminal.  This B+ doesn't come straight off the battery does it?!
&gt;And what should I do about the non-existant DF terminal?

No, the regulator should probably go &quot;between&quot; the battery and the 
generator - there shouldn't be a direct connection.  This might not
be true when hooking up an alternator, but AFAIK no splitty came stock
with an alternator.  Are B+ and D+ the only two terminals you have on
your generator?  Is one terminal bigger than the other, or are they
both the same size?  You *might* have an alternator or maybe a
generator with an internal regulator - I haven't heard of an
internal-regulator generator for an air-cooled VW but that doesn't
mean they don't exist.

Normally, B+ is the battery positive, D+ is the rectified (DC),
unregulated generator output, and DF is the input to the field coils
of the generator - the voltage regulator adjusts what it puts into DF
to control the output of the generator on D+ .  You don't usually
tie B+ and D+ together, or the battery will try to run the generator
like a motor when the generator voltage drops below the battery
voltage (for example at idle).

Good luck!
