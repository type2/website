Although anything was possible with VW, I think that you should have a
plastic plug over that hole. It is similar to the plugs in the doorjambs
over the hinge screws, except it is straight on one side like the hole. If
the wire is there, or you want to pull one in, go ahead and hook it up. Use
it however you wish. It may not be OG, but if you like it, it isn't hurting
anything. If you have the straight-sided plug though, you will want to keep
it. Haven't found those anywhere.

&gt; I finally found one of the little switches that goes on the left side of
the
&gt;speedo pod for the interior light...
&gt;
&gt;My question is:  should there be one in a double cab?  If so, does one
leave
&gt;the overhead light switch on and then turn it on and off by the pod
&gt;switch???
