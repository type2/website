In a message dated 98-10-20 08:55:10 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The blower that I installed was (i think) one of those bilge-blowers that
people are talking about, installed towards the front of the long heater tube
between the frame members.
 	My only problem with it was the irritating noise that it made when
operational. I'd prefer to have one that ran closer to &quot;whisper quiet&quot;. I've
already considered mounting the blower closer to the rear of the tube to help
alleviate the noise...
 	ideas and suggestions welcome. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Well the only problem with installing the blower farther back in the heating
tubing is that the fan will experience more heat and could melt down.  We have
thought of trying out the blower setup up front like you had, but after
thinking about it have put it off due to the following reason.  The problem is
that for all intents you are trying to have the heater system push hot air
into the interior that with good seals should be like trying to blow air into
a pop bottle with your mouth closed around the opening.  One way to avoid the
pop bottle problem is to come up with a way to duct the cold air under the
rear seat back into the engine compartment and engineer it so that when you
had the heat off that the ducting automaticly closed a flap to seal the two
compartments off from each other.  This system would probably not need any
electrical fans since you would use the engine fan and help increase it's
effectiveness by removing most if not all of the backpressure.  
Still if you drive in town and/or in below 35F weather for most of the winter
then you might just want to check out gas heaters.      Eric &amp; Barb
