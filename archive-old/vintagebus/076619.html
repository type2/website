----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; So, who sells new throwout arms?  Any better then any others?  For a late
&gt; model, that is, '66.

New throwout arms are readily avaliable from just about any VW parts place.

I would recommend getting the &quot;kit&quot; and put new bearings in at the same time
since you would have it apart.
