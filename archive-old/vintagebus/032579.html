&gt;Just a little update on the guys that stopped by here a week or so 
&gt;ago 
&gt;from Nebraska.  They and they're 71 bus are in New York today and 
&gt;should 
&gt;be to Maine during the day some time.  They're doing well and 
&gt;haven't 
&gt;had any more problems, but they say something is rattling in back, 
&gt;probably engine tin or something of the like.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a list of shows coming up on the east coast?  
&gt;Anywhere 
&gt;from Maine down to Florida.  I'd like to get these guys a list as 
&gt;they 
&gt;were wanting to attend some shows/campouts while on their trip.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
