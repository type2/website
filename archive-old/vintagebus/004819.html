Eric, and the rest of us -

Try Freightquote_dot_com
Honestly, THE best site for great prices on shipping parts!
Plus, nice &amp; knowlegeable folks too!
Don't be put off about the corporate or company shipper emphasis -
you can ship person to person with a little ingenuity.
Like packing the parts and taking them to your shippers' hub or having the
receiver pick them up at the hub - or even to/ from the workplace -just ask
your employer first! &lt;grin&gt; (Some companies refuse 'unauthorized
deliveries' )
Shipping hubs are clustered around most major cities - doing a little
research on the web and Freightquote_dot_com's pricing you can get the best
commerical shipper price for service in your area.

I second Greyhound as well!

No, I don't work for them - but have been able to use the site in the past
for parts for my '67 Deluxe.

Hope that's helpful.
Melissa
