Hi Lee,
Check out our article on the dual circuit MC for 1955-67 bus using a 1972-79 
bus MC in the type 2 library.  Though if you are using discs you will want to 
use the disc only outlet port from the MC that we mention avoiding using for 
front drum brakes.  Also make sure to install a brake pressure regulator in 
the system to avoid having the discs up front lock up before the rear drums 
and causing you to do 180 degree spins on even dry pavement!  Eric&amp;Barb
