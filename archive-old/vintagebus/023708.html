Subject: re;kadrons,doghouse,trannys,brakes and more

the 64 21 window i just finished the drivetrain on made it's maiden trip
back to cal.
without a flaw. the brand new factory 1600 engine, with duel kadrons and
1.25 ratio
(autocraft) rockers ran flawlessly average 25+ mpg going 60-65 mph with
a RANCHO trans with 3.88 r/p, this seems to be an excellent set-up,
after all the 1776
i've built for my buses, the 1600 with the kadrons and rockers seem to
have the power
and economy for a splitty, and the cost difference is minimal,
    the first test drive was done in 118 degree heat cruising at 50-65
mph up and down
hills with no problems, i.e. pinging overheating etc.it does have a
doghouse cooler with heater boxes an a flat four pea shooter muffler,
muffler is coming off not impressed with the fit and quality of this
item, probably better suited for a cal bug.
    the type one duel circuit master worked excell, softer pedal then i
personally like
but does stop the bus on a dime, used a dasher reservoir (filler cap in
orig. position) and made my own adapter
so that it would fit in the type 1 grommets, only problem was the
plumbing had to extend lines , made new ones to cross over to fit (have
my own bubble flair tool)
boy does it come in handy on these old buses.
   if any listy wants more info feel free to call me ronnie
