&lt;&lt; sn't it near the ashtray, on top of the dash?  I want to put one in mine, 
mainly for accessories -- not sure I want to drill the dash, but if I do, I 
want it to be in the right place.  I 
 have a bunch of stock lighters with roached elements, but the sockets 
themselves are fine.

ya, I think just towards the driver form the ashtray.   I didn't feel like 
drilling the dash in my 65, so I have the socket in the radio block off.  I 
had found one that had been predrilled.  I put the lighted socket in, which 
isn't stock, but easier to find in the dark.  Its not a ten point restoration 
bus.

hm- probably thoms webpage has a pic in there somewhere.
