Disconnect the battery.  Now, pull off the front kick panels.  Locate
the really crispy wire(s).  Replace.  Look under dash (may require
removing parcel tray or using fingertip-vision).  Locate the really
crispy wire(s).  Replace.

Seriously, it should be pretty obvious what produced the smoke,
because the insulation will be crispy and/or melted.  Start at the
fuse box and work your way up.
