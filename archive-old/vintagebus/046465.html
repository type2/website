Subject: Hubcap Clips (PC rims)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Guys--
I went out to the garage this morning to POR-15 my seat frames and take some 
parts I got in out there. I got my hubcaps in this week and decided to make 
sure they were going on my freshly powdercoated rims nicely. I put the 'caps 
on all the rims which aren't on the bus and they went on fine. I then went to 
pull them off w/ a hubcap removal tool and they came off along w/ several 
clips (the original VW ones). I now have 1 rim w/ 2 clips, another 2 w/ 3 
clips, and one w/ 4 clips. All of these were powdercoated over.
So, I'm ordering some new clips from WW, but what should I do to get the old 
broken ones of without ruining my Powdercoat job. Also--any tips on getting 
the rivets on? Do I need a special tool. Help!!!

What a crappy day!
thanks - Pete
