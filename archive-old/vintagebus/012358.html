Hi everyone!
After hearing your feedback and searching for sites the decision is in. The
campout will be held at VanHoy Farms in Harmony, NC.  We have 106 acres on
which to camp and mill around at a cost of $5.00 per night per person.
Electric hookups are there for those that want to use them(for an extra
fee). Hot showers and flush toilets are availible to all campers. Open fires
for cooking and warmth are permitted and well behaved pets are welcome too. 

VanHoy Farms is a kinda famous/infamous place because it was the site of the
Old Time Fiddlers Convention and many of the buildings remain on the site.
Casey VanHoy (owner/operater/resident) welcomes us as a group and requests
that we be respectful of others who may be camping there(mostly RV hookup
folk.) and have a good time!

The dates will be Jan 15,16 and 17. You can bring your own firewood but
Casey says that we are welcome to scavenge all the deadwood that we like.
Perhaps a chainsaw crew should be organized. Maybe Dave will bring the
singlecab or doublecab to haul wood in(hint,hint:)&gt;

Saturday night will be the potluck cookout. I will provide burgers, hotdogs
and buns. Lauren will be getting the veggie stuff together. Bring a side or
whatever you want to eat if the above does not appeal to you.

In honor of the event I have hastily constructed my very first website. It
has  directions(maps) and some bullets. Please check it out any suggestions
are welcome.
