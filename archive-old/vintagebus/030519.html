You can't see asbestos.  It is finely ground and incorporated into other 
mediums such as a fiberglass cloth, insulation, tar paper, etc.  It can only 
be detected by lab test.  I have seen plenty of asbestos comtaining materiels 
with a sheen.


Hi Volks,
So far we have never seen asbestos used in this area!  It is fiberglass cloth
which you can get at almost any hardware store in the fiber glass repair
isle.  Asbestos is much more grayish and has no sheen when in wolven form.
The little flat seals used around the heat riser tubes in fresh air engines
are asbestos.  There are rings of asbestos just inside the ends of the 62 and
later model type 1s and could be in the post 67 bus plastic heater to body
tube ends.   Eric&amp;Barb
