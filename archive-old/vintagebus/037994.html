Subject: Tilt Canvas Source, PLF &amp; ???
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I need to have a canvas made for my tilt setup.  I have the correct bows and 
everything just need the canvas.  This is for a crew cab.  Who all makes 
these?  I know PLF does...how do I get in touch with Dawn?  Truthfully, I am 
a little uneasy about using Dawn given the mixed reviews as of late.  Through 
it all I have never heard anyone say anything bad about the quality of her 
product which is a plus.  Would be very interested in hearing about other 
sources out there.  Of course if anyone has an original crew cab canvas out 
there I'd be interested in that too.

Thanks,
Dan
