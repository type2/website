Drive across the country in a bus with supected serious kingpin trouble?  Are
you out of your mind?!

Yes.

Seriously, though, I am considering this thing.  Without knowing beyond this
statement: &quot;..the mechanic said that the bus should not be on the road with
those kingpins...&quot; (not an exact quote, but close), I am feeling up to the
risk.  Or is that as idiotic as it sounds?

Granted, said mechanic has viewpoint #1, I need more evidence to really get a
grip on the situation.

Obviously, until I get more data, I'm shooting in the dark.

Option #1:  Get the bus and drive to the nearest available/willing Listee or
AIRS member with a couple used but decent spindles.

Option #2:  Get the bus and head for home.  Praying.

Option #3:  Have rebuilt spindles shipped ahead of me to the location of the
bus and put them on there.  (Sounds most sane)

Question:  Is it a common occurance that kingpins wear to the point of
breaking, thus lowering the bus, but not in a kewl way?

Another question:  How much time does it take to replace spindles and set them
up properly?

Funny...all of a sudden I'm delving into the mysteries of both ball joint and
king/link pin front ends....a place I've feared to go...

Thoughts, etc. most welcome!  Options I've not considered?

TIA,

Gene Cornelius
