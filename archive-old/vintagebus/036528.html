&lt;&lt; I'm not sure what you mean by farther back but I adjusted it today so it
appeared more &quot;centered&quot; within the intake orifice and the sound disappeared.
They appeared to be no damage to the ring from any sort of rubbing so I think
it may have been offset a bit and vibrating on the fan shroud.&gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
The thermostat ring as it opens when the engine is warm tilts forward.  If not
adjusted properly it will begin to rub the upper rear edge of this ring
against the inside of the fan.
 
 &lt;&lt;Thanks for the other suggestions - I'll see what the oil temperature turns
out to be this summer.  Last summer I used a meat thermometer stuck down the
Kombi's oil dipstick tube.  It may not be entirely accurate but when I tried
it on my Single Cab, which has an oil temperature gauge with a oil drain plate
sender, it matched the gauge exactly! &gt;&gt;
Sounds good!  Looking forward to the info!
Eric &amp; Barb
