Subject: sunday ad 

so easter sunday am. family asleep.
browsing the ads. see a 67 deluxe close by 1000 obo.
call the guy and go see. 1/2 hour later....
Oy. A serious rotter.
hang around and chat for a bit and people are calling about it and I hear
phrases like &quot;straight body&quot; (whats left of it), &quot;factory original&quot; (ok it
still had the RGBs), &quot;some rust&quot; (surrounding the holes i guess).
Ouch. Theres optimism and then theres delusion.
I hope the poor folk calling from Jacksonville didnt drive down.
Beware ads with few pictures....
