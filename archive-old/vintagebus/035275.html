&lt;&lt; This will come off as being a rookie question, but what is the exact
 difference between the two glass manufactures for spittys?  What years
 were each in use?  The two 63's and my 64 had a coupla sigla but mostly
 Sekuirt.  Was it changed during this period? Which is harder to
 find(probably depending on the year produced).
 
 ps. the costco canopies are super-duper.

Sigla is laminated and so it cracks easily and gets those misty bits around 
the edges.    It was used all the way around circa 61-63, though I have heard 
of the odd early bus with it.  Windsheilds were Sigla or sometimes Delog.

Sekurit is tempered and hard to break.  I accidentally dropped a intake 
manifold on a piece of it from about 10 feet up and it just bounced off, no 
cracks or chips.   It was used on most splits for the not windsheild pieces, 
though non N Am splits did come with Sekurit windsheilds, which the US didn't 
like cause they thought it could break people's heads.  Most splittys came 
with sekurit, other than circa 61 through 63.    Much easier to find, unless 
you want really early big logo SEKURIT (caps intentional) glass.
