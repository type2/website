I drive my 63 singlecab to work each day.
The drive is 11 miles each way on the freeeway or 8 miles on city streets.
I normally try to go at the edge of rush hour but if it is really rush hour I
use city streets.
The only problem is that I now am happy to drive 60 mph on the freeways, this
took a certain mental state change but everyone else on the list has obviously
made the change. In fact I sometimes even get to 65 going down the slopes with
my foot off the throttle unless I watch it.

I guess that I am really happy but wish that I could find a good location for
a coffee mug holder!!!!
