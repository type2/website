Subject: Re: [VB] [WetWesties] '57 panel for sale
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

This bus also has a round window in one cargo door, and a very, very strange 
bondo creation around the headlights. It has vertical exposed headlights 
similar to post 67 vws, with filler taking up the rest. pretty  straight 
though if I remeber right. I can never remember the name of the place in bend 
either.

&lt;&lt; i all:
 My neighbor has decided to sell her blue '57 panel with double pair of
 cargo doors. It still has the original Hella 3rd brake light, both pressed
 bumpers and  a nicely done wood veneer interior. Very little rust, 
considering
 the age of the vehicle: some bubbles below the cargo doors on one side, and
 quite a bit at the front floor. The cargo floor is really dry,amazingly
 enough. The bus has one of those vintage search spot lights attached to its
 roof, which can be guided from the cabin. Paint is bad outside, but original
 and shiny inside. It has some non original lights added in the rear (common
 problem). Has (according to the owner) a very recently rebuilt 1600 with dual
 Delortos, new tranny and brakes. Transmission from those guys in Bend, OR 
with
 such a good reputation, the name escapes my senile memory right now...She 
said
 the bus runas great. All this is from a 5' inspection I did today, I'm sure I
 am missing details.
 She wants $5,000. A lot of money, but this is a rare bus plus she might be
 flexible, who knows.
 I can get her phone number if anyone is interested.
