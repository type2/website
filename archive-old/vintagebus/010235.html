Subject: Looking for Tilt and hoops (or their measurements)
Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2000 14:44:04 -0500
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

Two weeks ago tomorrow I picked up my 66 SC and I love it.  I have lined up
a canvas seamstir(Man) and a metal fabricator to make me the tilt and hoops
for my Single Cab.  What I don't have are detailed measurements and/or
pictures of how it works.  There are a couple of pictures in the back of the
Bentley but not good enough to fabricate from.  Anybody with a tilt and
hoops for a split single cab help me out?  Also looking for the measurements
for the wood slats and angles profile.  While I am at it I also need a the
sprayers that go on the outside of the bus for the washers.  All I got is
the X-shaped hole and would like to keep the water out as well as I can.  At
least till I get safaris!!
