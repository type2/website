hey,
you'll have to forgive me if this is a silly question, i havn't ever heard 
it mentioned, but here goes...
last week i had the rear engine tin cover and fresh air hoses off and when i 
was replacing everything i started thinking... in the hot summer months when 
the heat wont be used, couldn't the fresh air hoses be left off, and the 
cooler air blowing out th3e fan shroud be used to lower the temp in the 
engine compartment?? i would think you could even bend the hoses around and 
direct the air to cool the tops of the heads. if i had a temp gauge i would 
give it a try and post the results... but i don't. hint... hint...
thanks for reading...
