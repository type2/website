&lt; get some new jugs
 
Feels a bit rough. Is this a faulty jug? Rings look good, move freely,
not broken. What to do?

&lt;don't forget the trophy for best camp set-up

Sorry, Kyle. Didn't follow your directions to the letter, will save the
heavy drinking for BBB. I'll pitch in for half your keg this year.  

&lt; 2 of the brew pubs are at the bridge, 5 minute bike ride from Crazy
horse
Mudshark is about 2 miles from the camp site.
maybe we can hire the limo and do a pub crawl
or if i get my double cab running in time i will host a pub crawl,
being i don't drink and can be the DD.

Ronnie, are those 3 brew pubs bicycle close? I can see Mudshark on
Streets 2000, seems to be the closest.
