Subject: Re: fresh air vent cover goo

I'm not familar with the RV putty suggested.  The plumber's putty
suggested, I've found, eventually hardens.  I agree that the top and two
side seals are rubber strip (with holes for the screws) and that the
bottom is a pliable rubberish &quot;goo.&quot;

I happened upon a viable alternative a few years ago when my bus was in
a parade.  To &quot;decorate&quot; it, someone bought the rubbery poster adhesive
stuff used to hold posters and papers on walls, etc.  When the parade
was over, everything came off my bus cleanly and I was left with a wad
of semi-sticky goo which I have since used to put around the speedo
cable and wiring harness where they go through the body.  Also good for
holding notes on the dash, by the way.

The stuff is about the same consistency as the original seal and
white/gray.  I came across some Elmer's brand in orange recently which
might look pretty funky, but it's the same idea.

It's been about 5 years since that parade and the stuff is still
pliable.  Should be readily available at an office supply store.
