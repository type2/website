&gt; OK, Jack sounds like fun but why? Is there something different about the
&gt; '67s steering box that requires the use of t something other the the 90w
&gt; that was used prior to that?

The grease always found teh sides of the gear box and caked there,
becoming ineffective. The oil almost always seeps out the not-so-well
matched case halves.  The mixture of these two gives a lubrication that
will neither harden on teh sides out of the way of the gears no seep
out. I use it in all my splits...all two right now...
