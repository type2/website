Subject: Re: [VB] front spindle nut

Hi Labmission,
If you mean the axle nut off the spindle.  While we usually prefer  using a 
certain sized wrench for most nuts and bolts.  We use a 12&quot;  cresent for those 
nuts to cut down on tools needed to be carried.  On the  otherhand if you are 
using the post-1967 axle nuts that are clamped to the  spindles with an Allen 
wrench type bolt, you need the proper Allen wrench  which is 6mm.
