Hi All,

I know this thread has gone on before but can anyone tell me a DuPont paint
code (or other brand that I can be cross referenced to) for the gray
undercarriage color?  I was originally going to just clean it, scotch brite
it and then primer it but the original paint has some what of a shine to it
and not totally flat like a primer would...

I thought from the factory, it was simply primer with overspray... yes, no,
?

Thanks
David
