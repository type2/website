hi there,

as i said in my original post about the location and price of the autozone
caps, i have an ORIGINAL vented cap of the same design, and plan on taking
it apart and figuring out where to drill to vent the autozone cap.

From looking at the old school one, there is a hole through the locking
body area... i just need to measure where to drill it, how deep and if
there is another hidden hole anywhere, hopefully i can do that htis
weekend :)

I should get to this pretty soon...

take care,

Steve
