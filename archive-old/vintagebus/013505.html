I agree with you completely NQ.  I sure wasn't considering selling all of my buses and buying who knows what based on these two Bozos, but I was just wondering if the danger described is actually a known fact, or an assumption.  Either way I'm still driving my bus. I know if you hit a Mack truck head on in a Volvo or in a bus you will probably be better off in the Volvo, but in the other 99.5% of accidents is the bus really that unsafe?  I have just never seen one fact supporting this.  Don't go try this at home, just to get the info though :)  Oh well, I'm going to go finish up the Arizona Bus Club newsletter now.  I finally have a day off.  Thanks everyone for your comments.

protection, jelly bean cars, and generic eggs on wheels - the pinnacle of
Ralph Nader's reign.
