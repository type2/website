&gt;  When I tried to turn it over: completely dead.  Stole the battery from
&gt;  Jessel, dead.  Charger all night long, dead.  Bought  a new battery on
&gt;  the way home the night before I was to leave, and put it in.  Turned over
&gt;  magnificently until smoke came from the compartment.  After the smoke
&gt;  cleared, I noticed that
&gt;  
&gt;  I CONNECTED THE CONDENSER TO THE HOT SIDE OF THE COIL!  AH!  
&gt;  


I like to write on the coil - on the blue part where it is easily seen- which 
terminal is 15 (hot with ig on) and which is the one for the condensor- with 
a sharpie/permanent marker.  saves me having to pull the coil off or contort 
to see the numbers.

my favorit mess up is forgetting to attach the point wire to he condensor.  
dunno how many times I have done that.  and I still have to tell myself to 
connect that wire.
