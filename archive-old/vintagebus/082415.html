Subject: Re: [VB] Surface Removal

Hi Richard,
First you need to figure out how much sanding you need to do!!!  If alot like 
50% of the truck then having it sand blasted might be the way to go.  If so, 
just make sure they do not use too much air pressure and warp the panels!!
  If smaller areas or tight areas which are hard to get to a mixture of 
sanding, wire wheel, and acid like &quot;Naval Jelly&quot; from your local hardware store or 
the straight phospheric acid from your local chemical supplier.
  After removing all rust apply a high content zinc primer (at least 95% zinc 
content) and paint soon after to seal out moisture.
