&lt;&lt; I also have OEM Mexican
 bus mufflers, these are the ones used on all the 1600 loafs in Mexico, which
 will work on all 1500/1600 split buses, and fit a lot better then the
 Brazilian. &gt;&gt;

The Mexican mufflers aren't much better than Brazilian ones.  The one I 
bought didn't come close to fitting.  I finally trashed it and bought a 
German muffler.
