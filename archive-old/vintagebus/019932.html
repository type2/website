Subject: BYOB Pics Are Up!

Hey all,

I have my batch of pictures from the show up at http://www.redshift_dot_com/
~taylorvw/svt/byob

And I'm also trying to find Rich Lujan of San Jose, CA.  He has a '56 Panel 
(I do believe it's the green one seen in Everett's batch of pictures with 
the westy interior) and he won the Old Fogey Award for having the oldest 
bus at BYOB.  If anyone knows him, point him my way please.

-Taylor
