The ones that SCAT imported were a mix of bay and split buses.  They were wide 5
bolt pattern drum brakes, but had boosters.  Type 1 motors with internal
regulator alternators.

All you guys out there that want to convert over to IRS on split buses should
look at this set-up.  I bet that's where Bus Boys and Wolfgang got their starts.

&gt; &lt;&lt; We imported a few of these (although they were crew cabs) and they were 88
&gt; &amp; 89
&gt;  models.  Bay windows with bug IRS, 1600 DPs, and a Rhino trans.
&gt;
&gt;  This was when I worked at SCAT.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; I have seen them with ball joint front end, also with kingpins.  The cargo
&gt; door is very like a barndoor, but much better reinforced. Think this one guys
&gt; was a 72.  It had a pop top.
