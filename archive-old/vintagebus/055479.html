Subject: RE: [VB] Viscosity of used oil

I used to have a P0nt1ac Grand Am that would show a slight decrease in oil
pressure near 3K miles. It did not leak, droped about 5-7 psi.

I was wondering today - As your motor oil gets old, toward that 2,500 to
3,000 mile &quot;I better change it&quot; mark, will your oil pressure drop?

So... A question for those with an oil pressure gauge - All things equal,
is your oil pressure higher right after you change your oil?

Interested,
