Subject: Re: Gas Guage, Horn?

Well I think I have finally figured out the cause of the gas gauge problem.

I bought a potentiometer as suggested and hooked it up as Matt described in his previous post and the gauge worked, except I could not get it to drop below a 1/4 tank and that's with hooking the ground wire to both outside lugs on the pot as described. So I took the sender out of the tank and hooked it up to the gauge with new jumper wires, stuck a coat hanger in one of the holes in the bottom and cycled the float with no action at the gauge. The gauge sat at 1/1 the entire time and I could hear and feel the float going up and down. So it looks like a new sender eh.

Also has anybody done the late Bay bus gas tank conversion? I've seen the &quot;How To&quot; on the VB site but I have some question about hooking up a BN4 with the late gas tank. Anybody have any good insight? I figured it would involve having another outlet brazed on to the tank in some fashion.

&gt; &gt; I checked the power to the gauge (black wire on back of gauge connected
&gt; &gt; to the + terminal) and I get 12.8V.
&gt;
&gt; This is good.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I unplugged the brown wire on back of gauge and gauge needle falls to R
&gt; &gt; as it does when the black wire is removed.
&gt;
&gt; Both good.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I jumped the negative terminal with a spare wire with female ends and
&gt; &gt; the gauge jumps to full.
&gt;
&gt; If you jumped the negative terminal to ground, this is the correct
&gt; response from the gauge.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Then I took the brown wire off of brand new VDO sender and grounded the
&gt; &gt; wire to bare metal on the body and gauge jumps to full.
&gt;
&gt; This is good. If the gauge went to less than full when you pulled the
&gt; wire off of the sender, then the wire between the gauge and the sender
&gt; is very probably OK.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Gauge gets power to lights without either the black or brown wire hooked
&gt; &gt; up.
&gt;
&gt; This is good.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Now I know that the tank is not full but it does have about 7 or 8
&gt; &gt; gallons in it.
&gt;
&gt; Was this combination (new gauge and sender) working correctly before
&gt; now? If not, maybe the new gauge is just a little optimistic. You
&gt; might try getting another two or three gallons out of the tank, by
&gt; draining it or by driving, and checking again. Or, unbolt the sender
&gt; from the tank, but leave the ground wire connected to the sender. Lift
&gt; up the sender as far as you can get it. Prop it up there with something
&gt; that won't fall into the tank and check the gauge yourself, or have an
&gt; accomplice check it while you hold up the sender. If it still hasn't
&gt; moved from 1/1, then either the gauge or the sender isn't working.
&gt;
&gt; Probably you did this, but the new sender might have had some tape or a
&gt; pin that has to be removed to free the float. If this is still
&gt; installed, you could get the results you are getting.
&gt;
&gt; If you have an old sender, you might connect it to the gauge and to
&gt; ground and see if you can make the gauge move with it. Or, go to Radio
&gt; Shack and buy a 271-1720 5K audio taper potentiometer. Unplug the wire
&gt; to the sender and hook up a jumper from the gauge sender terminal to
&gt; the middle lug on the pot. Ground one of the outside lugs on the pot
&gt; and don't connect anything to the other lug. You should be able to
&gt; make the gauge read whatever you want by twirling the shaft of the pot.
&gt; Most of the adjustment will happen at one end of the pot's range, and
&gt; if you find that the gauge tends to go quickly from R to 1/1 over a
&gt; very short rotation, move the pot ground to the other outside lug and
&gt; try it that way. If you can't get the gauge to read anything other than
&gt; 1/1 by doing this, then the gauge is probably bad.
