&gt;[...] this cool article about one family's 85-day trip thru Europe, 
&gt;starting with the purchase of a bus in Germany, then driving it up
&gt;to Westfalia to have the camper kit installed, which took 8 hours
&gt;and cost $259.70!

That's a cool article!  To put the prices and such in a bit of
perspective:  According to an inflation calculator I found at 
http://www.westegg_dot_com/inflation/ , $259.70 in 1960 is $1482 in 2000.
The article said they spent $850 ($10 a day) in expenses over the
entire trip, which would be $4850 ($57/day) in 2000.  A '60 Kombi
would have cost DM6975.  I can't find historical US$/DM exchange
rates earlier than '71, so I've cheated (in a potentially bogus
way) by indexing for inflation and *then* converting the currency
to get a current price for the Kombi of $18,174 in 2000.  By contrast
the MSRP on a 2001 Eurovan camper is $30,935.

In short, in 2000 dollars, they spent about $19,600 on the camper 
and $4,900 on a three-month tour of Europe.  Not too bad, IMHO.
