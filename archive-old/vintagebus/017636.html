There's several ways, with varying degrees of sucess:

* pimp yourself out as a computer 'ho (like me)
* sell blown glass &quot;novelties&quot; (bongs) at all the shows
* sell &quot;herbal remedies&quot; to go with said &quot;novelties&quot;
* learn how to wrench on these cars and do that for a living
* buy a car for $n, put a new sign on it for $n+2000.  Repeat as necessary
* talk old folks into sellng you their old VW cheep, then drive it down to the docks to be sent to tokyo
* start your own religion
* use someone else's religion, go on TV asking for money

&gt; Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
&gt; spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
&gt; would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
&gt; Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
&gt; that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn
