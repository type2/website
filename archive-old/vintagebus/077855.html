I have recently purchased a early 64 single cab, still 6v and want to keep it 
6v. The truck is not road worthy yet but as I get it there the electrical 
system is critical to me and I need everything to work. Do you have any 
insightful tips as I work thru this? Little important things you have experienced thru 
the years that make a world of differance? It appears everything is stock in 
this truck so no PO issues to contend with while wringing out the bugs. Thanks 
in advance.

Hi Ken,
As we have stated recently soldering the riveted connections in the headlight 
switch and all the clips in the fuse box to remove voltage drop from all the 
loose connections in them is a must.  Polishing, applying dielectric grease, 
and tightening all connections.  Only use solder and heat shrink when adding 
repair wiring.  We pull wiring harnesses out of wrecked VWs all the way up into 
the 1970s to cannabilize for the proper color and size wiring to replace 
wiring in our VWs.  Especially the nice crunchy engine wiring that has been exposed 
to oil and ozone so long that the insulation on the wires snaps like dry 
twigs!  The only crimp on connections we use are brass ones just like the factory 
and crimped on with a special hand tool.  If your battery cables have those 
replacement battery clamps that are bolted to the cables get rid of them.  They 
add just another connection for the battery acid to corrode up!   Either get 
all new battery cables with the lead clamps swedged onto the cables or better 
yet solder brass (Shuck's has them) cable ends onto them.  Solder grounding 
wires to the bulb holder part of the taillights and run these wires to the 
negative battery cable where it is bolted to the body.  The 1964 and later buses us 
a regulator mounted on the body and it must make a good ground contact there.  
Worse comes to worse you could run a ground wire between it and the generator 
body as done in post-1967 VWs.  Lastly removing your complete wiper system 
and taking it all apart for cleaning, regreasing the pivots, and repacking the 
wiper motor gear box with new lithium grease makes for quicker, and very much 
quiter wipers.
