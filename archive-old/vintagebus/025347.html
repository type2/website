It's much safer to carry it on your roof than inside the bus!  Just be sure
and strap it down real good if you're doing the bumpy road gig.  I'd advise
not making it a habit for normal everyday driving, just when you're
adventuring away from the beaten path.  I carried fuel inside the Tinkertoy
only once and got the Bejezzus scared out of me when I was almost t-boned by
a little old lady in a buick.  If it was just me that's been ok, but I had
wife, kids, and my DOG with me.  I don't know what I'd do without my dog ya
know? ;-)

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I too am interested in carrying extra fuel. I like to carry the whole
&gt; array of tools with me (large toolbox, extra parts, floor jack, stands,
&gt; mini-compressor, cheater bar, big piece of cardboard to lie on, etc) and
&gt; have a nifty heavy duty plastic 5 gallon gas can I would like to carry
&gt; on my butt-ugly (but sturdy) homemade roof rack. Maybe all this seems
&gt; like overkill to some of you, but I've had to pull blown engines a
&gt; couple of times in odd places (once at a truckstop, once in a motel
&gt; parking lot), and besides, you never know when you might run across a
&gt; damsel in distress...
&gt;
&gt; At any rate, how safe is it to carry a full gas can on top of my bus?
