&gt;what colour scheme would be &quot;blue and white&quot; on a 64' was this
available
&gt;
&gt;Sea Blue &amp; Blue White
&gt;
&gt;if blue and white was available what would colour would the original
&gt;interior be?
&gt;
&gt;Mesh Grey
In '64, wouldn't this have been blue white over turquoise with Como
Green interior? My bus is a '65 and it's sea blue/blue white, but
these colors weren't offered in '64, if it's actually a '64 and not a
'65 model BUILT in '64. Guess it would depend on the chassis #, huh?
