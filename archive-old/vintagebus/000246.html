Hey list!
Well here's the scoop.....I got a job offer today, so the family and I are 
'leavin Las Vegas' and packing up to move back to Texas.  The Waco area is 
where we'll be.
So are there any listees in the vicinity?  It'd be great to have some bus 
friends close by.
It sucks to have to say adios to all the listees I've met around here....John 
Howard, Ronnie, Eric, Jon Crane....etc. etc., these guys are the greatest! 
But I will try to make Jerome every year...Looks like BBBIV is out..since 
we're moving in mid-January.
Anyways, if you see a primered 65 camper heading east to Texas gimme a honk 
and if it's on the side of the road..gimme a hand :-)

Laters for now,
