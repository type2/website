The only thing my wife knows about buses is, why did you buy that rusty
piece o s#_at_t or that is the straightest bus you ever brought home and when
are you going to get all those buses out of our yard or NOT another one! She
did ride in one once!! and did she did say that if/when I do restore the 59
single cab (straightest one) she might drive it or even the side loader when
it shows up, but maybe if she drives one she'll like them better, BUT she
does know the parts, some even by numbers.
