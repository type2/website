Thanks to all who chipped in again. My bus is once more alive. I was ready
to pull all of my hair out this weekend. Usually when my bus is trying to
start up, I notice that the Tach needle shimmers a bit.  I saw that it
wasn't.... This stayed on my mind the whole time I was trying to figgure out
what was wrong.  After replacing $170 worth of parts that I didn't need, the
light bulb came on... I unplugged the tach sender wire from the coil and
bam... fired right up. There is a short somewhere in the tach wiring.  I do
however, have a new Crane electronic points conversion kit. That set me back
about $90, but I won't have to touch the points again, and hopefully my mpg
will increase slightly. Damn..time for work! Till next time...
