Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

     After all this work, and it IS a buttload of work, I would caution you
     to NOT use cheap bearings in the redux box.  The good stuff is 5 times
     as expensive but do you really want to go in there again?  After I
     rounded up the good bearings, I looked at, gently spun, and otherwise
     played with the cheap bearings I bought first in my ignorance.  The
     difference is apparent to even the most untrained eye, ear, and
     fingers.  You don't want to do this job over again because you didn't
     spring for decent parts.  End of lecture.  PS, you won't find the good
     stuff in a mail order catalog.  Go to a bearing supply house or a
     &quot;real&quot; Vw parts house with the old bearings or the numbers off the old
     bearings.  They are very standard items.  Expect to pay $25-30 each.
     Ray
