I have a 66 camper that was unfortunately equipped with those large

rectangular sideview mirrors(hidious).  I have purchased some elephant ears,

however, I cannot get the bolt out that holds the door hinge in place.  Is

is threaded?  Both the left and right upper hinges are rusty and getting a

grip on these hinges is next to impossible because the head is rounded.  Any

ideas would certainly be appreciated.

you have the nut off the bottom of the hinge bolt, right?   Soak the seams of
the hinge with solvent.  It is not threaded in there, just rusted in place.
For 32 years.  In the weather.      If you can get a grip on the bolt where is
sticks out the bottom of the hinge and rotate it back and forth with vice
grips, it helps.  Then use a punch and pound it up with a hammer.  Once you
can get a grip on the top, us the vice grips again and use a rotating twisting
pulling up motion.   It is generally difficult.    I have also drilled them
out, but it is neccessary to be very careful, as you don't want to drill
through the actual hinges, or the door motion will be funky.   Good luck.
Patience and a bigger hammer could help.      If you don't care about the
paint, using a propane torch  to get it hot alternated with water from a
bicycle squirt bottle to cool it down can break the rust free
