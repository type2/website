Subject: dizzy?

I've got alot  of stuff to say so I'll aplogise in advance. I've got a 69 bus 
and have only had it a few months now and decided to swap the 009 dizzy for a 
stock vac adv one (205T). Anyway once I had removed the 009 and went to install 
the 205T I realised with the help of my local flaps that the PO had modified 
the dizzy clamp so the 009 would slide farther down in the engine to mate up 
with the drive gear. This is an AK engine and I've read in the Bentley manual 
the some of these engines took a 3mm shim (113 105 235B) in addition to the 
normal 2 under the dizzy drive gear and came to the conclusion that this 3mm 
shim was missing. I tried to use 4 of the regular shims and had no luck. My 
question is has anybody come across this before and if so where can I (A. get 
this elusive 3mm shim or (B. use something else to boost the height of the 
dizzy drive gear just enough to mate up? You help is much appreciated.

PS Did anyone see the article in the Porsche mag Excellence where they took a 
59 bus 21 window and put all of the suspension and drivetrain from a Porshe 996 
into it, AWESOME?
