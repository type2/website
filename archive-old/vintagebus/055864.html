Subject: Re: [VB] Cool tool:  IR thermometer

Just remember with most of these temp readers, they 'fan out' quite a bit.
My friends IR thermometer spread to a 1 foot diameter at just 6 inches away
(and read the average).  So if you want something specific, you do have to
get it pretty close to it.    They are very useful tools.  Probably the kind
that after you own it, you wonder how you managed without it.

&gt; I think that someone has mentioned this before, but I just bought an
&gt; infrared thermometer and thought the list would have fun with it.
&gt;
&gt; The IR thermometer is a non-contact device.  You just point it at a
&gt; surface and push a button and you have the temp on the display.  For oil
&gt; temperature, just aim it at the sump.  CHT?  aim it at the head.  Some
&gt; parts of the muffler are over 500F at idle!
&gt;
&gt; You can also measure how cold your intake is and see if the heat riser is
&gt; working directly.
&gt;
&gt; Limitations are that the temperature is measured over a area about 1 inch
&gt; across, so you can't measure small objects.
&gt;
&gt; You can also pinpoint bad wheel bearings and CVs (they run hotter),
&gt; determine if McDonalds coffee is up to lawsuit standards, etc.
&gt;
&gt; When you get one of these you spend about an hour running around measuring
&gt; everything's temperature.  Lotsa fun!
