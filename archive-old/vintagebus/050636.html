Subject: eletric fuel pump

--0-919179502-1013661101=:41661

Thomas, i bought a rotary pump from john at air cooled _dot_net{59.00,i think} it has worked great , i was having trouble with the facet style electric pump, i put a bug pack  fuel regulator in line to to help keep it from flooding my duel carbs, the bug pack regulator leaked like a seive , so what ever you do don't buy one of the chrome  round style rgulators, i have heard nothing but horror stories about them and my could have been really bad, anyway the rotary style has a built in regulator so you kill two birds with one stone. i mounted the pump on my 61 single cab, about three inches from the gas tank on the inside of the frame , it was a very easy install and is not noisy.hope this helps you as much as all the info folks gave me when i had my fuel pump trouble
