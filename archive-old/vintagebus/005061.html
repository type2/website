Sorry.I guess my description s&amp;cked. I'll try again.


What Keith did was build a box around a standard home window a/c unit .Then
made brackets to attach it to the rain gutter (actually he may have it rest
on the top of the door,I don't remember ?)and poles to rest on the
door.There is a little door on the box to access the cord.A plexiglass
hinged door on top to see and access the controls.A tube fitting on the air
oulet to direct the cool air into the bus.
    It's pictured on page 8 of the May/June #73 NEATO's &quot; Old Bus Review &quot;.
    Hope that helps.

&gt; The description actually reminded me quite a bit of the evaporative
&gt; coolers that were readily available in the fifties.  RMMW's stocking
&gt; new ones these days, as well, for something like $450.  I've seen them
&gt; on non-VWs also.  Since they're intended for fitting into roll-up
&gt; windows, you do have to do some creative adaptation.
