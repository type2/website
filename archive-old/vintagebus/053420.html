Subject: Heater Box connecting tubes?

Since it is like 70 in Atlanta today I thought I would ask what a good
alternative to the plastic heater box connectors are?

I am sure Home Depot will have something I can piece together to work for
now...  Any ideas?  In the past I think I have seen people use flexible
exhaust pipe.  Kind of thinking a small dryer vent pipe will work if I can
find a small one.

I think I have a set that will fit but requires the engine to come out to
fit in right... Not going to pull the engine for that, figure a new excuse
to pull it will be coming sooner than later anyway :)


Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
