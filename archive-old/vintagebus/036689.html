Hi list,

I was recently given a parts list and I have a question regarding it. Is the
'up tp chassis number' column in the list the final answer when it comes to
compatibility or might there be exceptions.

I'd hate to have something shipped halfway round the world only to find that
it didn't fit.

Later 


Michael
