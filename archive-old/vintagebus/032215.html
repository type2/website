Ok...I think I made one too when I read that. VERY funny Kyle! That scored
high.

Ok, here's my three cents worth on safaris...as far as the NOS or OEM vs
Repro...if you can show me the m-code on your plate that says your bus came
with safaris, then I'll be impressed with original VW safaris. Otherwise,
go with what works the best is what I say, if it's not original on your
bus, adding VW safaris won't make it so. If I bought a bus with safaris,
I'd probably keep them in (case in point...my Zebra bus), but I don't see
adding them in to a bus I'd be keeping. Like people have stated in this
thread, the only time mine are open is cruising into the shows (like the
four shows I've actually made it to in that since I've had it 5 years).
Other than that...they don't get much use.

As far as leakage, one of the guys in our club claims that his don't leak.
He is not using stock rubber, he got something else but I can't say what.
I'll have him write up a little blurb about it and I'll gladly post it
here. His bus IS a daily driver and lately San Diego has been underwater.
Ok...well...we've had about three rainy days. :)
