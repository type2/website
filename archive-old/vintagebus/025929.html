&gt; The snap ring you can see does hold the shaft in place. You can pop it
&gt; off with a small long tool&quot;

&gt; #########
&gt; 
&gt; That's a special tool or a off-the-shelf small long tool ?
&gt; 
 I did it with a Jetta clutch rod, sharpened at one end. For thos not
familiar, it is a rod about 15&quot; long and a bit thinner than a pencil.
But like I said, only under rare circumstances would you need to do
this...like when someone cuts the input shaft.
