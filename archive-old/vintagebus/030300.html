Hello Boys and Girls,
                          My container just showed up(today!) and I do
have a turnkey/Driver that we drove about  15 miles home in this
afternoon.It is for sale.It is missing some parts but is pretty much
&quot;Rock Solid&quot; It does have some Euro style Welding that was done years
ago,including bodoed over Semaphore holes and big taillights and
turnsignals but over all it's not bad.Cargo doors shut real
nice.Definatly some bodo on it but oh well.Still has a split case with
lever shocks.Motor is a 67 I think also 12V.  asking $8500

Mark

P.S. Will have some photo's tomorrow
