&gt; I've said it here before, R.Buckminster Fuller designed and built 
the Dymaxion Car between 1928 and 1933. The specs are amazing... 19 
feet long, 67&quot; high, 70&quot; wide, 2,300 lbs., 378 cu. feet inside, 
seating capacity for 11 adults, top speed of 120 mph, 40 mpg at 
70 mph using a production Ford engine of the time. Amazing specs 
for today, but this was 1933. Here's some links...

I'd take those numbers with a big grain of salt!  I doubt that they were
ever tested, and inflating the positives was very common in that era.

Bucky was a visionary, but he wasn't a magician!
