Subject: Re: Reduction box trans

Forget all the hastle about flipping r&amp;p and axles. I have a 67 big
nut trans for sale and will deliver it to Jerome 98. It came out of the
flipped 67 kombi I bought last weekend. Can't guarantee how good it
works, can only say the PO drove it from LA to AZ at 60 MPH +- before
it flipped on I40. I think we can assume it must work OK or he would
not have made it the 300 miles. I will sell for $100.00 drum to drum
at Jerome. If a listie wants will save and deliver to Jerome. Let me
know.
