Was confirmed late last week that we will be moving to Florida.  As such I 
would like to sell some of the larger items I have so I don't have to move 
them.  These are going to be *** buyer pick up *** items.  There will be a VW 
show, MoKan Bug Blitz - Independence, MO., less than 2 miles from my house on 
June 10th.  This would be a great time to come get them and take in a great 
show in the same weekend.  Show usually has over 100 entries.  I'll provide 
camping space for anyone wanting to attend - buying anything from me or not.

Disclaimer: I want to sell this stuff, not talk about selling it - I will not 
hold anything without payment, first one with cash gets the part(s).  Once 
paid for I will be glad to hold it till you can get here, provided you do so 
in a timely manner.  If you can't get here to get it you need to make 
arrangements to have it picked up.  I'm moving, date not set yet, once I'm 
gone I cannot be responsible for your item.  

Pricing: I'm trying to help some listees out and avoid Ebay on most of the 
items.  Please do not buy these things to put on Ebay or otherwise resell.  
If you do, and I find out I won't sell to you again.  Period.  **Make a fair 
offer the first time and it is yours.**  Will consider trades up/down/even 
for SMALLER parts and/accessories. (nice '58 engine lid, passenger side 
ribbed truck bumper splash pan, '58 bus/truck parts, original EMPI stuff, 
spotlight side view mirror, original gear shift lock, original fog lights, 
accessories, accessories, accessories)

NOS gates will go up on Ebay tomorrow evening unless there is a serious offer 
before then.  Other parts may be put on Ebay depending on the response.

More items as I clean out the garage I'm sure...

Thanks,
Dan
