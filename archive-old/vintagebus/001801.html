Subject: rear wheel nuts - Physics Question
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 2000 18:03:32 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I'm going to tighten up my rear wheel nuts and I thought I read somewhere
about how to figure out how much torque I am applying.  That is, by knowing
my body weight and the length of the pipe I have welded to the socket ... ya
know?

I see that St. Muir just says to get em as tight as you can .... I'd rather
have the formula.

Anyway, I'm kinda spaced out after a 3 hour exam ... pls don't ask in what
subject.

TIA
