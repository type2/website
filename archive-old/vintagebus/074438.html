Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance

I was using Hagerty for my '60 DD for a year.  $92/year.  Never
had to file a claim, so I have no clue as to how 'good' they are.

Any of the classic car insurance companies will impose restrictions
of some sort on what you can do with your car.  Hagerty seemed to be
more liberal than others.  As an example, a certain insurer that's
big with the classic Porsche crowd will only insure you if you own
your own house, you have to have a locked garage, can only take the
car out when the moon is in Uranus, etc, etc.

I concur with Thom, as I speak from experience as well. I utilized Hagarty
for several vehicles in the past (non-VW). They have incredibly low rates,
along
with guaranteed &quot;agreed value&quot; coverage. What the prospective Hagarty (or
other classic car insurance company) customer does not know, is that they need
to
have a near perfect driving record. Somehow they caught wind of a traffic
ticket (one of only 2 I've had), which was for around 18 MPH over the speed
limit. After this, they refused to insure anymore one of my vehicles. They
also
required a locked garage, and impose very limited driving restrictions. I
wanted
to use mine for pleasure (4000 miles a year), and for shows (2,000 miles).
They flat out told me that this was way too much (and they do check odometers
supposedly). Anyway, as Thom said, I'm sure they are less restrictive than
others. State Farm now insures my vehicles, albeit for much more than Hagerty.
The
plus side is that I can drive them for pleasure as much as I want (within
8,000
miles or so a year), and I have the same full coverage as I do on my 2002 New
Beetle.  :-)

Cheers,
