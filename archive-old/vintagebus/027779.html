Subject: Floor brackets for my '65 Westy

Help
I am getting close to a paint job (about 6-7 weeks)for the Batmobile but
before I can put the z-bed back in I need to get some brackets. The
beautiful cargo floors I bought from Ronnie need the brackets that are
welded to the floor and hold the z-bed in place. Ronnie told me they
were the same as the brackets that hold the rear seat of a Deluxe in
place. Anybody out there have a floor they are cutting up that might be
able to pass these on to me? Does anybody know of another source?
TIA
