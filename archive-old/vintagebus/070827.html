Subject: RE: [VB] Rear facing lights

I have to predicate my reply by stating that while I'm not familiar with
how busses were delivered in Europe, I can tell you that Porsche 356
cars of the same era were delivered in Europe with an accessory rear
facing fog light that was equipped with a red lens. In fact my 1998 Audi
wagon has one as well that is built into the rear light assembly. The
early Porsche 356 cars have their rear fog light mounted onto the body
near the left hand side of the rear bumper facing backwards. Later cars
had them mounted to the bumpers.

Here are links to a few pictures of early cars that I found on the web.
Of course when actually searching for them I could not find any pictures
of the bumper mounted rear fog lights.

This car actually has two. 1954 coupe.

This car shows one that is fitted to the body. 1955 Speedster.

Usually this is one light that is brighter than the regular tail-light
on the car that stays on as long as the switch is in the &quot;on&quot; position.
Applying the brakes or turn signals has no affect on this light as it is
constant. I have seen a motorcycle product used on vintage auto's that
impressed me enough to consider buying one if I ever came across it.
When applying the brakes it rapidly flashes the brake lights three of
four times to draw the attention away from the newspaper/cell
phone/coffee cup of the person behind you before going solid.

Someone had mentioned the LED style tail lights earlier and I wanted to
say that while I have no experience with them personally I have heard
mixed reviews about them such as the light being somewhat washed out
during daylight hours and not being bright enough to prove effective.

Your mileage may vary.

Best wishes,
Gary

Jim Share of Abilene has a 3rd brakelight in his rear window of his 
'67 Westy. I don't know if it lights up at night, but would be an 
idea.

How about some bumper mounted reverse lights, turned around to face 
the back of the bus. Leave 'em on at night. Should light it up pretty 
good.
