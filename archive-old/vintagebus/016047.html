I agree: it seems nobody *here* wants to buy a bus that someone has
put work into and cleaned up, at least not at a rate commeasurate with
the parts and labor that went into it.  I had a LOT of people emailing me,
wanting to buy my panel, several *specifically* wanting it with the
rust and before I did anything to ie, cheap.   I bet I'd have a hard time 
selling it today.

I know of a nice,dry '54 ambulance/camper that nobody seems to want to
buy, but I'll bet everyone would bitch like crazy if it went overseas.

Sometimes I feel guilty about cutting up the hoopty camper last fall, but
then I go outside and take a look at the remaining pieces, and the rust,
hacks to them, and I don't feel so bad.  You can figure if it was below *my*
standards for saving, it is pretty damn bad!
