Hy Ty,
First the fan has to be out of the bus.  Then you could use a special spanner 
wrench for the job, or you could do what we do.  Take the switch body by one 
hand and the threaded on collar by the other.  The trick is that while the 
switch is held from turning by two locking grooves in it's body and the 
mounting panel there is just a little play room in between these.  So you 
hold onto the collar and turn the switch slightly.  Then rotate both the 
switch and collar together back to get more room for the switch to move the 
proper loosen direction again, and repeat until the collar is loose enough to 
spin off.
