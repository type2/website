&lt;&lt; I just couldn't do it. After I got home today I called the sales agent and
 told her to cancel the sale and I will mail the deposit check back to her in
 the morning. She asked if I sold it for more to someone else and they would
 match or beat it. I said NO I just can't get rid of it. I have sold over 100
 buses in the 34 years that I have been messing with them and this is the 1st
 time I have ever done this. Told her a little more behind it and she said
 she understood, but the offer was still on the table if I decided to sell
 later. Don't think so. Anyway thats the story from the horses mouth.  OCTO
 was super great, Classis great.
