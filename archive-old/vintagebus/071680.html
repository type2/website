Subject: voltage regulator - update part 2

List,

I had a chance to install the VR last night.  Everything went as planned.  No
&quot;magic smoke&quot;, no sparks, fire, doom, gloom.....    I have not yet had a
chance to drive it (other issues to sort out, cooling and what not) I will get
a VOM on it tonight to see if it is doing what it should.  Are there ant rec.
procedures for testing the output of the alt/ funtionality of the VR?
