Subject: Re: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ /Antisieze


Cal said:
I'm just full of suggestions tonight, or just not 
busy, but I've been
coating the threads of all the high torque and large 
nuts with Permatex
silver AntiSieze grease for over 20 years, and never 
have to wrestle with
these fasteners ever again. Especially the hub bolts -

I coat the surface
where they sit in the rims also. 

Aren't torque specifications usually for &quot;dry, clean
threads&quot;?  Doesn't oil, grease, or antisieze compound
lubricate the threads and make it easier to stretch
the bolt, in effect over tightening the fastener with
the same amount of torque? (I recall that I have put
antisieze on these kinds of fasteners mayself.)
Can some one out there clarify this?

Thanks!
