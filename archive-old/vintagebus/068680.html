Subject: Ricki Fu update

   I just got a call from Ricki Fu and family, bus travelers supreme. He is
still push starting his bus. I tried to contact people in Louisiana off the
AIRS list but most of the phone numbers are no longer in service. Anyway he
stopped at Autozone and bought an auto starter he will install once he gets
to New Orleans, a couple hours away. 
  After New Orleans he will head up I65 heading towards Ohio, if anybody
along that route would like to meet him and his family, p-mail me and I will
forward your info to him
