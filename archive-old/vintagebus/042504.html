ANY year 79 or older, they will all fit in a panel as there is no under
rear seat heat tube to interfere with.

If you had a standard i think 72 down has the legs that are offset to
clear heat stuff...

but in a kombi and panel, anything goes as far as fit... the newer rear
seats even have way kewl headrests ;)

take care,

Steve
