Subject: Re: [VB] oil coolers, heat and etc

It's my understanding that you ought to cc the heads before installing  
shims.  That way you can do the math and figure out what CR you'll  get.   esp as 
the surfaces may well have been machined.   Also, make sure the heads match 
each other...I had heads done by NW Connecting  Rod and they wanted to hand me 
back a mismatched set.  different styles  have different shapes and volume, 
don't get a different CR on each  side!!!!
 
I have a 7.8:1 CR in the engine I redid the top end on ~6 years ago, it's  in 
my 61 bus... some people say that's too high, others say it's too low.   I 
matched the bowls in the heads to make all 4 w/in .5 cc of each other, cleaned  
out the flashing casting (in between the fins, they block air flow that cools  
the heads) and converted it to a typeIV doghouse, think I balanced the rods  
too.   A pretty good engine so far... not high performance, just  a 1600sp 
that pushes the bus along at 60mph in the summer happily, with power in  reserve. 
 (009, 28 pict or 30 pict carb, stock muffler) I tend  to slow down to 55 if 
it gets over 90*, to keep the oil temps to  210.  early 64 suspension &amp; 
gearing. (1 ton later beam, big nut  RGBs, 4.375 r&amp;p, 15&quot; bus rims with 205 75 R15 
tires) Drove it to Jerome  &amp; back last year... it's not always in the temperate 
NW.  YMMV

&gt;   lowering the CR is fairly easy -  take off the cylinders, and put in
&gt; the appropriate spacers.

You  can end up with a motor that runs hotter this way too, believe it  or
not.

If you raise your deckheight more than .060&quot;, you start  loosing the benefit
of the squish factor. After your deckheight is much  over .100&quot;, it's all but
gone.

The ideal way to do it is to keep the  deck height between .040&quot; and .060&quot;
and open the combustion chamber a bit  to gain the extra cc's IMHO.

My 63 drag bug (12.2:1 CR)  has a  deck height of .043&quot; and can run on 91
octane without pinging. If I did  nothing more than open the deckheight up
with some spacers to lower the  compression, it would start pinging like a
mad-man.
