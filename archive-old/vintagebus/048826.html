Subject: Drove the '59 Kombi!!!

Not much. After I got the newly assembled engine idle and timing set 
it was already dark. I just drove it around the big circle drive in 
the front of my house and then into the garage. I've got to admit 
that the engine runs much smoother and is a lot quiter. Probably due 
to the fact that I worked real hard on making sure all my exhaust 
system was sealed real good. It was actually kind of weird cause I 
couldn't here the engine that much up in the cab! I don't know if I'm 
used to my wife's vert or what. But I could hardly hear the engine 
revving while I was up front and had the windows and doors shut and 
was driving. Didn't shift really. But what I did felt smoother as 
well. I didn't replace any of my clutch stuff, but I did clean it all 
up real good. Maybe it helped a little.

I hope to make my maiden voyage to the gas station this week. I've 
gotta do some work on the electrical first. Looks like I'm gonna have 
to replace a brake cylinder at one of the back wheels. It's leaking 
all over my fresh white wheel. It's a big nut. Does Ronnie carry 
those? How much are those?

Getting excited!!!
