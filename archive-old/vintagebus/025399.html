Subject: Questions: Sandblasting a 23 window
Message-ID: &lt;374E1416.472D7F59_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

My next door neighbor is working on a correct resto of a 23 window bus
that was pulled out of a dried up river bed.  He would like to take it
to a local guy that specializes in bead &amp; metal blasting of classic cars
and have both the inside and outside done from head to toe.  Here's the
problem.  One these buses, the belly pan runs the length of the bus and
is welded in.  He is picturing the sand blasting adding 50lbs of weight
in the sand trapped between the floor and the pans.

How would someone get rid of trapped sand?  Any suggestions for this or
otherwise?

Thanks,

Scott
