Nope. unfortunately the guy wanting to put a Chevy motor in the 59 is not
joking. After I posted the message to the list about this being a Vintage
mailing list he sent me some hate mail. Also told me how putting a 1600 in a
50's bus is just as bad as a Chevy motor.

&gt;That's so very appropriate.  Great analogy!!  Now lets just hope that the
guy
&gt;who was wanting to do the opposite engine transplant is joking just like
&gt;Brian is.
