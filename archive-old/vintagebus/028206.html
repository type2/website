i have been slowly rebuilding the interior of my bus...and some of the stuff i
don't really need anymore...right now what i believe is  called the spice
rack(the cabinet that is on the cargo door)...is going to be available
shortly.

anyone interested...I am in Houston, TX
it is the original from a '65. I plan on trying to make drawings of all the
stuff i reproduce to share in the future...i'll let you know how that goes.
