&lt;&lt; I wonder about using old grease.  Isn't it contaminated, and that's why 
you're replacing it?

Hi JP,
It is contaminated with dirt/dust and has broken down from it's fine 
load/high RPM bearing lubricating former self, but still has it's oxygen 
sealing and some of former lubricating ability.  Which works just fine with 
threaded fasteners.  Just like the parafin trick of melting it into threaded 
fasteners helpos due to it's lubricating ability that would/will not work for 
high load/RPM bearings.
 
&lt;&lt; But, does anyone know any reason NOT to use antisieze on the brake 
adjusters?  I just had my rear brakes apart, and decided to try antisieze 
instead of grease. &gt;&gt;

It will work just fine also!   Eric&amp;Barb
