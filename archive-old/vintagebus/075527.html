&gt;on further study today, what i REALLY want to do is forego the radio at
&gt;all; instead, i am on the hunt for some powered 12v computer speakers!

Another option: buy some car speakers and a cheap car-stereo amp with line
input and run the Ipod into that.  Costs more but might sound a little
better.

&gt;if i can swozzle them in to a cigarette lighter jack, and plug them into
&gt;the ipod headphone output, viola. all the potential thief will see are
&gt;some fugly computer speakers and a jack sitting on the dash.

OTOH, the amp/speakers might be a slightly more desireable target - thief
may also assume you have a 24-CD changer stashed in the Bus someplace as
well.

&gt;matt, i don't suppose that massive brain of yours knows the milliamp
&gt;output of a vw ciggy jack?  :)

The inspection lamp socket in an ambulance was wired downstream of a fuse,
so 8,000 milliamps.  :)  However, if you wired it directly to the battery
hot wire at the fuse block, you'd basically have whatever the battery
could give you, modulo the resistance of ~1 m of 25.0 mm^2 cable (battery-
starter) and ~3.5 m of 6.0 mm^2 cable (starter-fuses).  Per DIN ISO 6722
part 3, via Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th edition, p. 792, that's (1 m *
0.743 milliohm/m) + (3.5 * 3.14 milliohm/m) = 11.7 milliohm or 0.0117 ohm.
Assuming a perfect battery (Thevennin resistance of zero) and no losses in
the ground side, shorting the cigarette lighter socket would result in a
current of about 1,020,000 milliamps - at least until the wiring catches
fire.

Seriously...A cigarette lighter jack can power almost any speaker system
that wants 12 V power.  It'll probably come with a wall-wart for 120 V use,
that will probably be rated between 500 and 2000 mA.  As long as the
speakers want 12 V, you can connect them directly to a lighter socket, no
problem.  Even if they want less than 12 V, Rat Shock sells lighter cords
with regulators in them.  Probably their cheapest ones are the fixed-voltage
ones that give you 3, 4.5, 6, or 9 V at 1000 mA for $12.
