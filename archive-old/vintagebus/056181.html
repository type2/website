Subject: Re: [VB] VWOA Trademark Licensing Program

Ya, I really like their marketing plan, after a scorched earth campaign tell
the walking wounded that 'we really like you, but it was for your own good'
. Has anyone seen their new commercial where they tell you their always
trying to improve while they lean heavily on their aircooled past. The same
people who want their old cars to disappear so we can buy 'new' beetles.
Does anybody else think this is just their teaser for the 'new' bus.

&gt;
&gt; Well, Dave, c'mon. Until VWOA starts loading people into boxcars,
&gt; gassing them, shooting them, etc. we might consider the Nazi rhetoric to
&gt; be a little exaggerated.
&gt;
&gt; For people who may be interested, here is what seems to me to be a
&gt; nicely done tutorial on trademark law:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.iusmentis_dot_com/trademarks/crashcourse/
&gt;
&gt; My read is that it isn't commercial exploitation/competition that VW is
&gt; worried about; they're worried about the value of the marks being
&gt; diluted. I am not a lawyer, though (a shortcoming for which I never tire
&gt; of congratulating myself).
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody know a journalist who cares about technology issues? What
&gt; do I know, but I think this is just the richest story; if _Wall Street
&gt; Journal_ or _Wired_ were to look into this, they might find that it is
&gt; an incredibly interesting story about how very badly you (VWOA) can
&gt; shoot yourself in the foot on the internet if you don't understand the
&gt; medium. I think the license-for-free initiative is above-board,
&gt; personally, but the continuing controversy shows what a spectacular hash
&gt; VW has made of this whole thing. I can't think how they could have made
&gt; the internet public more hostile toward them.
