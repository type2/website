Subject: square back carbs

I was wanting to run a pair of single port dual carbs off of a square
back.  Has anyone tried this before. The linkage is missing. It uses a
push pull likage. I was going to try to use a linkage sold by bugpack
that I had seen, but that cable type linkage looked interesting, could
it be used on the solex carbs? Has anyone here made cable likage like
that ?
