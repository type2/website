Ok Volks,

I've just gotten back from Pensacola, Fla. and I can now confirm that
Jeff owner/operator on &quot;The Little Shop&quot; has at least 4 Z-Beds, and Bay
window Westy interiors, 3 complete transmissions w/ reduction boxes etc.

This guy is a true Guru and very, very reasonable in negotiations and so
forth.  He is a Viet Nam Vet so is very frank and just a little gruff.

 I had a fellow list member pick up 4 Jealousy windows and my soon to be
EX never did pay him and all he said was &quot;I don't give a **** &quot; and he
was very cool about it!

I did see a NEATO/SOTO beige colored Splitty at his shop, apparently it
came from Italy and she lived in Niceville, Fla.,  so perhaps she could
share more information with fellow NEATO/SOTO members, never met her so
I'm not sure if she is on the list or not?  Members of &quot;Rare Air&quot; could
also tell ya about this fella.

I'll he going down again too soon for my mother's funeral so if there is
anybody with some conversion plans or restoration wishes I may be able
to get them what they might want/need and can pick it up or look into it
for them.  Pick ups will require the trust to bring the money down with
me so......
Or arrangements to get there will be up to you.

May the &quot;Busma&quot; come through for you too!
