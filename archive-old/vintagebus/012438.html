hey volks,
just wondering if anyone is interested in selling in selling a pre 67 
microbus in western canada or as close to alberta as possible, any 
response will be awsome, and if your interested i have a 72 westy that 
is fairly smooth, so a trade might be on my mind.
peace &amp; happy riding,
kenny
