I had to replace the left outer rear wheel bearing in my 66 with reinforced
reduction boxes. This uses a roller bearing, part number 211 501 283. The
original one was a FAG, number N207E, made in Germany. I ordered one from
IMC. It came as a Bower, made in USA, with a bearing number of MU1207-CX. It
is CRAP! Even with the center nut torque at 250 ft-lbs. the drum rocks
almost a 1/4 of an inch!!!
I am removing a used one from my bad transaxle to use in this transaxle I am
putting in. It has the brand name of DWB. That is a new one on me....never
heard of it. But it also is a N207E bearing.
