Hello List, been lurkin for a while as I recover from surgery. 
I'm now ready to start work on the 63 delux again, the last thing I had done was fill the red. boxes &amp; tranny with dope. Shortly after the trans started dripping fluid, the bus had been sitting for 13 years so I figuard the seals had dried up. I also could not get the trans to go into 1st or 3rd, even after &quot;trying&quot; to adjust the shift rod. I have decided to change the trans so that I will feel better about a long road trip.
The Question:
Looking thru the july vw trends I found an ad from Kustom 1 Warehouse with a 61-67 bus trans for &quot;only&quot; $195.00 each. Has anyone ever bought one of their units and if so was it a good unit? Any other sugestions.
I had thought about using a type 3 and getting rid of the red. boxes, but still not shur of what to do, looking for the list for help.
Thank you.
Meredith Murray.
