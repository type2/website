Yow,

I pulled the motor to torque the heads (H case single port) ala Muir's dual pattern method.  Some of the bolts weren't even on finger tight!  Most all the nuts under the rockers needed tightening, only one of the upper bolts was loose, if 15 lbs is loose.  I think so.

All things being good, I suppose I could have gotten away with leaving the motor in.  All things were not good though.  Two of the studs were popped.  It would have been motor out in any case.  Besides, it's a split dang it!  I pull my motor every other day just 'cause it's so easy!

Those locals who know me, chill...  This isn't my motor I'm working on.  Blue Thunder's still a rollin'.
