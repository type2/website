How bout you add the dates of shows, Like Buses by the Bridge VI, January
18,19 and 20, 2002, Jerome Jamboree in September, etc. and if you include
January 2001 you could add Buses by the Bridge V, January 19,20 and 21,
2001, Lake Havasu City, Az.

Hi All,

I have a good collection of photos but could still use one or two more.
Pictures that aren't high enough quality for printing or don't make the
month will still get into the mix as occupants of the squares at the
beginning or end of the month that don¹t have days in that particular month
so keep em' comin'.

Now what would be cool is something to add to specific dates of the month.
Things like this will add to the personality of the calendar. Perhaps dates
of annual meets around the country or &quot;This date in type 2 history&quot; snippets
I am trying not to go overboard, but I think this would be cool.

The great thing about digital printing is that we can add them as they
become available and not hold up printing for want of data.

I am still shooting for a Friday print date. As soon as the files are done I
will contact all listers who expressed interest and hit the particulars
about shipping addresses quantity and payment.

Thanks to everyone for everything! This should be a great little piece of
bus fun.

Sam
