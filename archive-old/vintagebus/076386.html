Subject: Re: [VB] &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

Clara,
Do you have good experience with cleaning off clutch discs? I have an old
German clutch plate cover with a disc that began slipping. I changed it and
put in a diaphram clutch and disc. It is harder to control and wish I could
use the original one I have. I'm afraid that the oil soaked disc may just
slip again. Is there a way to tell if the clutch cover is any good besides
just looking at it closely for wear? Anything else to look for?
 Dave

&quot;I am pulling the d_at_mn motor back out of the 65 as the clutch is slipping
and I gotta clean it off.   The first oil change is due, so I pulled the
plug when I got home today, and it's dripping into the bucket. hopefully it
was the oil pressure weirdness that made the clutch get icky.   It was a
lovely clean new disc and 9 spring clutch, too.&quot;
