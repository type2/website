&gt; With my previous post, Matt Roberts helped me identify the ports on the back
&gt; of this thing (picture at link above), but I still need a solution.

Hi Greg,
You have most of it correct with Matt's help, but you have one wrong.  The 
port listed as speaker at the top of the case is for plugging in a tape or 
record player.  Grounding is by bolting the radio to the bus and make sure to 
attach a metal strap on the front (FIF) of the case and attach it to 
somewhere like the dash tray center mountng bolt to keep from bending/flexing 
the dash over rough roads.  Lastly make sure to carefully lift and lower the 
top and bottom panels on the radio so you can vaccum it clean and make sure 
the case polarity is neg and the voltage is 12 or 6 volt depending on what 
you are running in your VW.
