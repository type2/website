I hope you all realize it isn't the gearing that limits a busses speed on
the highway. Gearing has to match the engine horsepower and torque curves.
As much as we might like, you can't get something for nothing. All these
stories of folks with original; sp engines that all of a sudden have a 75
mph screamer just aren't true....sorry.
