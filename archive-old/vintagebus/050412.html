Subject: [VB] engine vent trim reproduction
Message-ID: &lt;0.13cbd913.2548ec12_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Back in October or so of 1998, Richard, who makes reproduction round tool 
boxes (www.roundboxtools_dot_com), asked the list via Thom about interest in 
reproducting outie engine vent trim for 55 thru 3/63 deluxes.  He said: &quot;I 
would have to make 5000 at first enuf for 275 busses. Retail would have to be 
about 80-84 dollars a full set. What do you think?&quot;.

I decided to follow up on this just to see if anything was done.  Richard 
recently wrote me back saying: &quot;I had the tooling made and a few pieces made 
to prove up the process.  The trim looked real good.  However in my research 
for customers I found there to not be enough customers to make this project 
feasable.  If you know where I could find 275 customers willing to pay 1/2 
now and 1/2 on delivery I would do it.&quot;

There did not seem to be much interest in this back in 1998, but I told 
Richard that I would see if any interest has picked up.  The price seems okay 
for me, and I would be willing to spend even a little more for repop trim.  
It's just finding the demand that is a problem.  So is there any interest out 
there? Reply to me or the list and I will tally up the results and post them. 
 FYI, Richard's address is Oldred62_at_aol_dot_com.

I don't know how easy it is to take that trim on and off, but even if you 
have the original trim,  you coul have a show set and a street set for 
parking on the streets of lets say, CA, or anywhere else where there seems to 
be a lot of stollen bus reports.  :(   For the 
customization-is-sign-of-a-creative-imagination folks, this is your chance to 
add a little something to that kombi :)  For all the rest of us who just need 
the trim, this is a chance to get some without a second mortgage or the use 
of extortion.
