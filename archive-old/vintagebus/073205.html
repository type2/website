Subject: RE: [VB] New FPs

CB Performance Part #4573 &quot;Fulcrum Plates, set of 2&quot;
are $19.95. With tax and shipping, the total for me
came out to $50.79 to my door. That's not too
expensive for the peace of mind I have knowing that I
have new parts in there, not worn out, scored, chipped
pieces of scrap metal. They are standard size, with
the 2 oil channels down the flat face (better oiling).
I think the last time I ordered them directly from VW
they were about $9 each, so not much difference there.

CB Performance Part #4450 &quot;11 Tooth Spider Gear set&quot;
which has both axle end gears and new spider gears is
$99.95. Again, to me that sounds pretty reasonable if
you have thrashed ones and no other good/useable
spares.
