i finally got smart and ordered some vent wing latches for my bus (I should
have ordered them in November before it got cold). does anyone know a
procedure for installing these? do they need to be welded on or do you just
kind of fit them on there? in case it matters, i got them from RMMW and they
are the universal bug/bus kind in chrome. Thanks!
