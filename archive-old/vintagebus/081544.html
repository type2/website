Subject: 30/31 flooding 

You must mean the needle and seat. It is just above the float. Any carb 
rebuild kit should provide these. Also must check the float level (height) 
and make sure it is not leaking (filling with gas).

John

&gt; OK now that I know whats wrong, how do I fix it.  Someone mentioned a 
&gt; check
valve somewhere, but I could not find any.  I've blown air in and out of
every passage I could find.

&gt; Any suggestions?  I'd like to not buy a new carb.
