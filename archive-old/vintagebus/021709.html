 i _think_ those little brackets are the same 55-79... but i am not sure...
 (at least teh seat hardware is teh same for the rear seat...)
 
 might be worth a look-see.

seems like that to me too,  cept even earlier too,   go chop a barndoor!  
they are the same bits that the seat hold down bolts go into.  As a matter of 
fact, the westy z bed gets seat hold down bolts to hold it to those bits.  
hm, couldn't you fab something out of a bit of metal?    they aren't that 
tricky.  Are yours totally rusted or what?    maybe there are some on that 
bit of bus floor leaning against the garage, guess I'll take a look tomorrow.
