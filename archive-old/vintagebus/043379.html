&gt;I installed a sony headunit in my 66 dlx about a month ago and have had 
&gt;no problems.  Yesterday coming back from the Tocoa, GA show it started
&gt;cutting out.  It only does it had highway speeds in 4th and at the end
&gt;of the lower gears when the engine is reving high.  

I'd vote for an overvoltage situation, rather than undervoltage.
You might take it out on the road and rev it up to where the radio
starts cutting out.  When it does, turn on the head lights and see
what happens...if it cuts out more, then your charging system is
weak (dying battery, generator or brushes going out, etc)  If it
stops cutting out, your charging system is working *too* well...
perhaps a worn regulator or loose battery connections.

You might eyeball the radio connections to make sure they haven't
loosened up any.  A sheet metal screw works OK for a ground, but
a nut, bolt, and star washer might work a little better.  Around
back, clean up the connections at the generator, regulator, battery,
and starter - remove the battery negative cable before doing anything
and reconnect it as the very last thing you do.
 
&gt;The headunit power wire is wired into the 2nd to the right fuse on the 
&gt;fuse box so it's only on when the bus is.

Don't sit in your bus with the engine off and the key on so you can
listen to the radio.  Since Buses don't have an &quot;accessory&quot; position,
when the key is on, everything is on.  If your points happen to be
closed while you're sitting there, you are running a lot of juice
through your coil and can potentially damage it.  This probably
doesn't have anything to do with the problem at hand but I thought
I'd mention it.

Good luck!
