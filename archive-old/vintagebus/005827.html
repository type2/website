Ok. Heres the deal. I got the red light to go off, changed the generator
brushes. Now the van stays running, sort of. Sometimes when I start it up it
revs up real high, then dies down. It won't idle, it jsut bogs out. Only
stays running if I keep the throttle partway down, and I really have to rev
it up if it starts to bog out to keep it running. I have it narrowed down to
a timing problem or something much worse. I don't know what that much worse
thing is, thats why I hope its a timing problem :) I tried adjusting it per
Muir, but maybe I was just too irate to get it to work, or too timid,
because I didn't change anything while I was trying to time it.  I had the
clip on my static light clipped to the wire that comes from the coil
(actually I had it clipped on the wire on the coil, as it wouldn't clip
behind the distributor cap), and the other end grounded to the body. I got
the light to come on, but my problem lies here. I have a 1971 beetle block,
w/ other parts from god knows where, so I don't know where to set my timing.
I have two notches on my pulley, if that helps. Any help would be greatly
appreciated, as its 60 degrees here and I'm still driving my damned winter
beater! Thanks
