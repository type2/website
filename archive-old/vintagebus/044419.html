Subject: Re: [VB] carb doesn't fit with altenator..

&gt;By the way, if he is &quot;restoring&quot; it, why
&gt;is he going with a non stock motor.

Are these kind of comments really necessary? It really comes across 
in a negative way to me. I think it's obvious from my question that I 
was looking for technical help. Are we really to the point to where 
I'm gonna get a comment like this about not having &quot;the right &quot; motor 
in a bus? Give me a break. And I was wondering why I was getting 
burned out.
