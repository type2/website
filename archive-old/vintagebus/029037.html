Subject: Brake trouble (flames)

On the way to HCBF, my right front wheel errupted in flames.  The brake
shoes had locked up, heating the wheel to the point that the brake hose
ruptured, the valve stem melted out, and the rubber boot on the steering
linkage caught fire.

Fortunately I was in a carabus with three other buses and there was no
shortage of helping hands and moral support.  However, the proper
replacement parts were hard to come by on the outskirts of Boone.  We
clamped off the brake line with a pair of vice grips and drove on to
HCBF (another 20 or 30 miles).   I had just happened to pull off the
road into the parking lot of New River Tire on Hwy. 421, they repaired
my tires (spare was kind of sad) and loaned me some axle grease for the
bearing.  In addition to taking care of me right away, they refused to
take any payment for it!

Saturday morning, after getting new brake shoes (on the shelf since 1980
- thanks Chris) and a rebuild kit for the wheel cylinders (I already had
new hoses with me), I set out to repair the damage.  Rebuilt the
cylinders, tweaked the return springs (they were badly streched and we
couldn't find replacements) by bending a loop in the middle, installed
the pads and drum.  Adjusted and bled (all) the brakes.  The right front
proceeded to lock right up.  Readjusted the brakes to get the wheel
turning, but it locked right back up after two or three pumps of the
pedal.

Although the loop in the springs was rubbing on the drum, the springs
had plenty of pull inward on the shoes.  Removing the drum, I found that
the wheel cylinders were fully extended.  Pushing on just one, it slid
back in quite easily, pushed on the other one, it goes in fine, but the
first one pops out.  Pushing on both at the same time, they won't go
in.  After several minutes of working with them, they slowly eased back
in.

So, :

New Hose
Rebuild Wheel Cylinders
New Shoes

Hurtin Return Springs - but I really don't feel they were the problem.

Where should I look?

Our best theory was some type of trash in the metal brake line or master
cylinder.

Stumped everyone at HCBF that stopped by the tent while I worked.  After
three or four hours said the hell with it and got a beer.  Put the old
hose and vise grips back on and enjoyed the rest of the weekend.

Drove home with it (even participated in the Parkway Carabus), lots of
following distance and compression braking.

I figure this weekend, I'll tear into the metal lines and master
cylinder.  I'm needing suggestions on what to look for or test.

Thanks,
