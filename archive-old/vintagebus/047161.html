&lt;&lt; The turn indicator switch on my 1967 (12V) doublecab seems to have packed 
up. 
  Does anyone rebuild these units?  Anyone have a good (working) on for sale?

are you sure it is the switch?   take the drivers side kick panels off (if 
applicable) and use your test list at the 9 pin blinker box to see if it gets 
current when you use the turn signals.  you should check with the wiring 
diagram to see which colour wire means what.  

just a thought
