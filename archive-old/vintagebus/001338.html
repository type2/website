Subject: Got me another bus.

Well whoever said you can't have just one bus was right.  I paid $350 for a
1967 deluxe this morning.  I spoke at length with the owner (Judith Noah)
and she told me she's had numerous offers on this bus over the years but
would never sell.  I guess I came along at the right time.  The bus is
complete and original - the dash has had a hole cut in it for the VDO oil
temp guage but the radio and clock are still there.  The rust is limited to
behind the front wheels, battery tray, forward cargo floor (in the corners)
and rockers.  Nothing major - especially compared to my 66.  The frame on
this bus is 100% solid and the front floor has some slight surface rust but
absolutely no rust through at all.  Definitely a better condition bus.  So,
I'm gonna take all my good stuff out of my 66 and move it over which will
cause me a slight delay but in the end, give me a much better bus to start
with.  I think I'll end up selling parts off the old 66 to fund this
project.  I'll let you know when this stuff is available.

This 1967 bus has, from what I can tell, the original engine (although
Judith said it had been overhauled).  It's an HO case.  The bus also has a
12v sticker on it so that's cool.  Engine compartment is clean and by all
intents and purposes it looks like I can put a battery in it, clean the
carb, check the brakes, etc. and then fire her up.  The clutch is lying limp
though - that was her main problem.  By how Judith talked, the clutch has
either gone south or the bowden tube is messed up (do buses have them?)  I
also suspect the spring on the tranny is shot as well.

I'm late for work as I type this so I better move on.  Check out pictures of
this bus at:

Where the URL says bus1.jpg - change that to bus2.jpg, bus3.jpg and so on
and so forth until you get to bus13.jpg - you can see all the pix of it.
