well i took off on my first road trip in 10 years in my 66 bus today, ive
rebuilt the top end of this engine a few times, i just started running it a
couple of months ago, after it sat waiting for 10 years, well anyway i was
cookin down the highway , cruisin 60-65, and all of a sudden that godawful
rod slamming the case sound kicked in after about 75 miles, so i turned it
around went to the gas station and humbly called AAA, well anyway i need a
good 1600 dual port long block,

would any one like to reccomend a good source for a rebuilt engine or should
i fork out the cash and get a new one?
