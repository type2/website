Hi,

I have had an experience with the teflon additives. If the Tranee is new its
probably ok and will extent the life. I have also used Moly-Sulfide
additive. The tranee in both cases became noticably quieter. If you have an
older, worn transmission, you stand a chance of the tranee popping out of
gear.

good luck,
Chris
