Subject: Re: [VB] shift knobs

True story,
I know a guy who had just got his new bus up and running and put on that nice glass shift knob he
found in a box of parts in the bus. on the initial drive he felt a slight pinch/burn on the backside
of his hand which he had put down on the seat next to him and he jerked his hand away and couldnt
figure out why, you know, you blow those things off sometimes, first drive, your worried about
everything else.  then he left his bus parked out in the sun by itself and came back to find an
unpleasant suprise, in the form of a hole/burn in the middle of his newly upholstered seat! The sun
was being focused right in the middle of the seat by the glass knob, like a magnifying glass! Not
too happy to say the least. If you make these, a disclaimer would probably be a good idea.

&gt; I need  the size and thread pitch for the thread insert for shift knobs on
&gt; Splits , Bay and vanagons? Anyone know this?? A friend is making some
&gt; really neat Glass shift knobs for buses and we need to see what sizes are
&gt; out there. any help would be great.
