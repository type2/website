&lt;&lt; Does anybody have a truck rear bumper in california that they want to 
sell? 
 I need a slash cut for my '63 crew. I do not need one in perfect shape, just 
 one that is salvageable. I do not &quot;need&quot; the splash pans or overriders, but 
  &gt;&gt;

fwiw, Your truck came with the same rear bumper as a non truck type2, 63 did 
not have a truck only rear bumper
