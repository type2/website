&lt;&lt;  Having got the nose, is it best to flange the bus, or try to cut
accurately
 and butt-weld it instead? Joe has a 110-volt MIG but we don't know what
 we're doing.

You guys are scaring me!!  First off, if your just going to skin the nose, cut
the old nose off about a half inch away from all seams with a wheelie cutter
or nibbler.  This will allow your better access to the spot weld below the
windshield and it will also allow you to undo any of the hemmings flanges from
the backside so you don't screw up any of  inner flanges.  You what to do the
opposite with the new nose, if it has the pillars, cut the pillars and work
them out of the hemmings flanges.  You want to undo the spot weld for the
windshield on the windshield side and not the nose side.  Now time to trial
fit.  You will need to spread the side flanges out to about 90 degrees so they
go around the pillars.  I have a set of sheet metal vise grips that are about
4 inches wide that do the trick quite nicely.  Go slow and just do same bends
until you get them where they slip over the pillars.  Once this is done remove
the nose and start prepping all the mating surfaces.  Weld thru primer and
holes for where your gonna spot weld and a good primer sealer everywhere else.
Put a little seam sealer on the pillar edges and set the nose back on.  Take a
hammer and a dolly and slowly close the edges of the flanges a little bit at a
time.  Up and down, up and down till you get the flanges tight.  Then weld
away.  My gosh I hope this makes sense.  I do this stuff everyday, but trying
to put it into words is rather hairy.  :)
  Peace, Love, and be sure to use eye protection and happy hacking!!
