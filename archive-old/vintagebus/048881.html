Subject: One more middle seat question!

Hi List-

I have a 67 21 window walkthru that presently has a 1/3 - 2/3 middle 
seat.  It appears to be a 67 seat (the right side legs angle out), 
but it doesn't seem to want to line up with the clamp brackets on the 
floor.

Questions:

1) How do I determine definitively that this is a 67 seat?

2) Did the walkthru style bus ever come with a full width middle seat 
(making it an 8 passenger)?

TIA
