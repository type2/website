The bike water bottle cage idea is great even if it is a little too
utilitarian looking. Although, you can get them in cool anodized colors.
When I used to assemble industrial machinery, I had one fastened to a magnet
which held it to my roll-cab. They really are simple and effective.
I suppose if you had a strong enough magnet you could stick one just about
anywhere in your cab without the installation being permanent. I can see
catching my knee on it every time I climbed in and out of the bus with it on
the column.

&quot;Since I'm waay too lazy to ride my mountain bike anywhere that would require
two water bottles, i'm going to transfer one of the cages onto my bus in the
same fashion. I was way impressed with it's simplicity.&quot;
