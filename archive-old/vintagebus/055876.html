Subject: Re: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

I would be inclined to believe it is a westy , especially because of the sub
hatch.
would a simple way of describing it be as a sort of weekender? not a bus for
full fledge camping?

I thought I read something some where that the demand was so great for the
campmobiles that VW was unable to provide enough Kombis and sent standards
to Westfalia to be converted also. Is this correct?
