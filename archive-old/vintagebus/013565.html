&gt; Now I'm trying to track down the details of the GL-3 specification to
&gt; see
&gt; if it's compatible with a Type 2 transaxle's unique requirements.

Info from:
http://www.lubrizol_dot_com/referencelibrary/readyreference/index.htm

(this is a very extensive site with all sort of specifications for
lubes, additives, etc.)  Check it out!

GL-1 
Composition: Straight mineral oil 
Use: Truck manual
transmissions 

GL-2 
Composition: Usually contains fatty materials 
Use: Worm gear drives, industrial gear oils 

GL-3 
Composition: Contains mild EP additives
Use: Manual transmissions and spiral bevel final drives 

GL-4 
Composition: Equivalent to obsolete MIL-L-2105 specification; usually
satisfied with 50% GL-5 additive level 
Use: Manual transmissions, and spiral bevel and hypoid gears in
moderate service 

GL-5 
Composition: Virtually equivalent to present MIL-L-2105D; primary field
service recommendation of most passenger car and truck builders
worldwide 
Use: Moderate and severe service in hypoid and other types of gears. 
May also be used in manual transmissions 

GL-6 
Composition: Obsolete 
Use: Severe service involving high-offset hypoid gears

There is also a mention of a specification for copper corrosion
resistance.  If I read it correctly, the spec for GL-5 requires that
the materials be exposed to the oil for three times as long as they are
exposed for the GL-4 test.  This would indicate to me that GL-5 would
be less prone to corrode than GL-4.  I may be misinterpreting the
chart, though, so check it out for yourselves!
