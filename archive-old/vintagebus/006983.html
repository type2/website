WCM is making bus upolstery but only in basket weave and square weave, there
market is really the type 1 and 3 owners  and the bay owners. Nothing for
the early bus. There foam is square edged. TMI foam is form and contoured to
fit the seat frames, used with there sisel mat makes for a nice seat.

I prefer just using standard foam and cutting it to fit.  I get 30&quot; x 60&quot; x
1&quot; foam and hog-tie it to the frame.  I put almost 50K on my bus before I
sold it and they still looked new.  I do prefer the TMI seat covers though,
they fit good and the qualityis nice.

Rumor has it that the WCM seat covers are supposed to be pretty nice too,
but
haven't actually seen any yet.  Last I heard they had rented another
building
a few doors down and started to buy machines to make interiors.

I used to work for TMI and although the owners are a bit screwy, they do
make
a really nice product.  It's amazing what daddy's money can buy nowadays!!
