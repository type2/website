Subject: Sand Seal question

I just noticed that my hot-running 1641 hydraulic has a sand seal but no
crankcase vents
except for the oil filler tube vent into the air filter.

Its a wet engine...could this have something to do with it?
Could this have something to do with running hot?

At any rate I'm putting a stock pulley on it soon so I'll see if that
makes a difference.

Thanks for any input,
...Markus
