Subject: VW sanding process adequate?

Well, it looks like Matt has come down with the infamous &quot;it's Friday, (cough
cough) I don't feel well&quot; disease, so he's taking tomorrow off from work and
we're putting in a full day working on the VW's.  Mainly just cosmetics (wash
the crusted-on bird crap off, vaccuum the 3 months worth of dirt out of the
wrecked squareback because the shop it sat at forgot to roll up the windows,
stuff like that), but we also want to sand some of the minor surface rust off
the body of one of our VW's.  We've searched the archives and come up with
this.  
1)  start with 80 grit paper or a wire wheel attached to a drill.  remove all
rust and paint as needed.
2)  paint with primer (waterproof and sandable) we have wet sandable Rustoleum
(ok?)
3)  resand with 100 grit 
4)  repaint with primer
5)  resand with 400 grit

This is nothing major here, we're leaving the really bad spot of rust to a
body shop, but there are patches here and there that just need sanding and
some primer.  Are there red flags going off in any of your heads? are we
missing any drastic steps?  can we leave any of these steps out if we dont
have any plans to paint the car right away? we just want to get rid of some of
the rust Any recommendations would be appreciated!!
