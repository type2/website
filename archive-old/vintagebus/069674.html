WOW, Just FIVE?
Here's a quick top ten list,  I could have put more, but I think in keeping 
with a top 10 list, that's enough.

10. It's thrifty with the gas.

9. Its easy to work on.

8. Lots of hidden storage space for my Ham Radio gear and tools

7. Its different, I can find it easily in a parking lot.

6. Seats six in a pinch, five adults easily.

5. Fun to watch those not familiar with riding in the front seat of a bus, 
looking for an O-ShIT bar when stopping normally.

4. Trips to the dump!, drop all the gates and off goes the stuff from any 
side.  One day, I backed up quick and jammed on the brakes.  Everything 
went flying off!

3. It holds my motorcycle AND gear AND 
people  http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/vw/bultaco.html

2. My 17 yo Daughter actually has fun driving it and putting all her HUGE 
paintings in it.

and the NUMBER ONE reason....  (drum roll)

1. Its a damn fun truck to drive and have around.
