Subject: Bus sighting in revenge of the nerds 3

For whatever wierd reason, I was watching Revenge of the Nerds 3 the 
other night, and there is a part where the new nerds call Booger who is 
now a lawyer, and while he is taking the call, he drives by a nice dove 
blue Double Cab  parked on the street.  It's all of a 1/2 second, but 
thanks to Tivo, I was able to double check it.

I basically avoid tv, but moments like that make me think I should 
watch more
