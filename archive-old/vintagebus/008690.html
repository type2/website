Well, after all this flywheel talk, I decided to go and check my
stash...Would you believe I found a BRAND NEW one? Part# 211 105 271C, The
hand written label says: 109 teeth, 200 mm Type2 to 8/66. This is new, but
probably not OEM, Most of my stash came from BAP/GEON. These guys must have
been pretty big back in the day!!
   Does anyone know what this might be worth???
TIA
Michael Moore
