I think I'd have to go with BeetleBus.  That's how
I'll start describing my crew cab.  By the way, do
most people say crew cab or double cab?  Makes sence
to say double, since there's a single.  I've seen VW
documentation that describes the 3 door pickup as a
crew cab and a double cab.

66 Crew, no Double - now it has an identity crisis
