&gt; if there is a concrete pad then there may have been a
&gt; construction
&gt; there before. This may still be officially part of the dwelling in
&gt; which
&gt; case it may not need any permit at all.

Or it might just be a parking pad (very common in California).  My
feeling is that you'll need a permit and landlord permission for any
permanent structure (one with a foundation or bolted to the slab).  
OTOH, if you put up a temporary canopy you probably won't need one. 
There are a lot of canopies out there that might do what you want.  You
have to replace the tarps every year or so, but that expense is minor
compared to what you would spend on something more substantial.  The
canopy will keep the rain and sun off, which is all you really need.

You can secure the canopy to the slab, but you do it with tie-down
straps, which make the canopy &quot;portable.&quot;
