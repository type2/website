&gt;&lt;The pre-1968 bug wieghs about 1200 lbs. and the pre-1968 bus wieghs 
about
&gt;1600 lbs..  We have towed bugs and ghias (Ghias wiegh about 1400lbs.)&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My original owner's manual for my 1964 Ghia lists the &quot;Kerb&quot; weight as 
1808
&gt;lbs. with a maximum carrying capacity of 661 lbs. for a permissible 
total
&gt;weight of 2469 lbs.
&gt;
&gt;Just to keep the facts straight.
&gt;

I just want to add that my bus, 1963, with camping interior weighs at 
least 2500 pounds. Even without extras, this seems to be a real weight.
