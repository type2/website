&lt;&lt; I am going to remove that silly 110vAC connector from the rear of my
 bus....I'll not be using it, y'see, and I would like to install a powerful,
 wide-beam reverse light that can be activated by a switch that I install
 somewhere up front (can be later changed to a tranny switch when I get a new
 tranny) &gt;&gt;
Hi Michele &amp; Gene,
Why not leave the outlet and install some type 1 and 3 reverse lights on the 
bumper just below the overrider tubes?  The inlet and interior outlet are 
handy especially to allow the use of a small electrical heater to keep you 
warm at RV camping spots during the colder weather months.  Eric&amp;Barb
