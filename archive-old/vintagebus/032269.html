Hey John,

yes, all side mirrors were dealership mounted. So, the Elephant ear mirrors
are &quot;correct&quot;.

But...as Kevin mentioned and as you noticed in the mag the Truck mirrors
are also correct. EZ Campers (like Kevin's and mine) often came with the
&quot;truck&quot; mirrors on them. They are as correct as anything, so go for it...

&gt;I had one of those truck side view mirrors installed on my bus at one point,

&gt;sorry, but i never actually saw them, just what they did to the door.
&gt;
&gt;I believ that all the side view mirrors were dealer installed, ie the buses
&gt;came without side-view mirrors.
