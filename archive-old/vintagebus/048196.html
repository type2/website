Now the guts of the stuff, and some questions
The truck is grey with a really nice black rubberized canvas.  The hoops
are preaty heavy duty metal and go as high as the cab.  The sides are
rolled up then held in place with 3 metal hooks that hold the roll.  The
back also rolls up under the top &quot;canvas&quot;.  This motor was rebuilt by a
shop in april and I have the recept for the work, looks like a full top
end rebuild with new heads, p&amp;c, etc.  How can I tell if this has the
doghouse coler or the regular upright? 
-  -- - - 
reach around the left side of the fanhousing towards the front of the car.
If it is a doghouse there will be a boxy thing there , hopefully with the
pieces of tin that vents it out through the forward engine tin (to front of
truck).  If it is flat it has a regular oil cooler.
...........
Other needs are a clunking in the front end when going slowly going over
bumps.  Loud road noise from the front(wheel bearings).
- -  -- - 
are your shocks attached?    I had one unattached in my 59 when I got it and
it made a clunking noise.   Also check your steering and jack it up in front
and grease the suspension and check the kingpings by wiggling at 12 and 6 on
the wheel,  there should be no play, also wiggle at 3 and 9.   If wheel
bearings are loose it will cause play.  If youa re worried about the front
wheel bearings pop off the wheel while you have it jacked up and clean and
regrease them, replacing if there are bits missing or shavings.

  Headlight glass
and tail light lenses. 
- - -  -
junkyard probably- headlight glass is same as any split (cept those wierd euro
lenses, which aren't common her anyway)or 66 and earlier bug, taillights same
1962 through1971.  I actually have a bunch of extra headlight lenses.

.......
 There is some rust on this truck but preaty
surface expect under the floor where it is a little pinholy.  There is
very little rust under the windows.  No locks work,
- - - - -
take the handles off and to a locksmith (door panel off, two allen heads
screws to undo) and get a key cut to code-  which should be something like
T1234, usually on the little pin screwed to the inner end of the lock
cylinder.   Cut to code is better than cut to a worn lock- a local locksmith
here charges $15 and gives you two keys. Actually odds are the handles haven't
been removed, so you could just take one off.  Or take both off and while the
panels is out take the door mechanism out, clean it and grease it and see how
much nicer the doors open and shut.    (While the door is open, push the latch
thing vertical (like when the door is fully shut).  When you press the handle
button it should pop out enthusiastically.   If it doesn't I would take it
out, clean and grease it)
 ....
and a couple window
latches need help.  Any ideas for fixing the sliding window latch when the
little nugget that falls in the slot is broken off?  
- -- - 
get a replacement- VW swaps or a junkyard with a splitty.

congrats on the new bus !!!!
