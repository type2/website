 It occurred to me that in this particular case, it probably would be easier
to graft this roof onto another bus. I checked out the m-codes today and
there's nothing particularly exceptional about this bus to keep me from
considering the conversion/parting. I knew of a good candidate for this, but I
think it's sold. I'm going to check out another good candidate this week, but
I have no money, so I don't know why I'm bothering. I *swear* I'm not an
addict! I can stop anytime I want to!

Hi,
Just make sure that the bus you mount the sunroof section to is either a
double door or another sunroof.  That extra floor panels under your bus are
what keep it from flexing and twisting itself to death.   Eric &amp; Barb
