Biggest problem I could see would be missmatched comp and rebound rates
i.e. early motocross bikes used air shocks didn't work too well cause the air
would heat up and cause a pogo effect (known as the ass over teakettle
effect) on a bus though w/ low, slow rebound rates might not be a problem.
I'm assuming good gas shocks in rear  and cheapee oil in front
