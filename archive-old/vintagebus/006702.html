I always use Vavoline Racing 30 weight in the winter and 40 weight in the
summer, the racing oil has a better tolerence to the abuse of high RPM, high
heat runs. After the trip to Pomona and the following Classic weekend
journey (1500 plus miles) my oil looks as new, the filter pump is awesome
(oil still fresh looking)
and no idiot light at idle, don't have any gauges (34,000 miles) and still
going strong. It's been 115+ degrees here and I still drive my bus everyday
without any problems except higher idle after long runs (duel Kadrons with
worn out throttle shafts).

My oil of choice is Kendal GT 1 but they don't sell it in our fair city.

I ran straight 40 weight all through mexico. It is what the locals used
in their a/c vw's so I figured it was ok. Never had a pressure or temp
problem with it.

What do the southern cal and arizona folks use in the summer?
