My engine appeared seized the other day, rather not explain why, told the
story too many times already. Anyhow, the crank pulley, generator pulley, or
the flywheel would NOT turn. Today, took the heads/cylinders off, and then
bumped the flywheel, everything moves. No noises, no metal shavings in oil,
AND my pistons/cylinders are within spec, .014 was the space between the
ring ends. No seize marks in cylinders or odd appearing pistons, etc. Should
I just put it back together and hope?

well, perhaps you should share what happened when the motr seized, as it does 
affect whether or not you should do a bottom end rebuild or not.  Generally 
speaking, if the oil fell out of the motor the main bearing seize up, and you 
need a bottom end rebuild, but you could possibly get away w/ reusing some 
top end stuff if it is still w/in spe, but it don't sound llike what 
happened.   Perhaps you drove too fast in hot weather and overheatde #3 and 
it seized iin  the top end.

Anyway, how much if any metal flakes/chunks were in the oil?  If you punched 
a hold through a piston the rod there may be bent  (do not re use)

DO not put it back together and hope.   You can re use it is it is not too 
worn.   That is fine.   Indications eg- wear on bearing- how is you end play? 
 How are the rod bearings? replace them even if you do not crack the case- 
cheap and easy.   Wear on the cam?   how do the surfaces the rods were on 
look?

ar ethe heads cracked or spark plug holes stripped out?

just some stuff to mull over.

BTW helped someone pull apart a motor yesterday.   He had planned on just re 
placing the Ps And Cs (punched a hole in #3), but I showed him a crack in one 
of the heads.  Bad.  And turning the FW with the ps and cs off there was a 
spot where it was not turning smoothly, and he didn't want it to be a total 
rebuild but i said it's not supposed to have a sticky spot, better pull it 
apart now.  Was a never torn apart Mexican motor, standard everything.
