Hi Steve,
The 1959-67 starter strap was the same as your 1967 one.  The 1961 one of 
yours is a DPO add on, but should not hurt!  Unless your bus is going to be a 
show bus or trailer queen keep the 1967 RGBs and just install a 1964-67 
(1966-67 are best) front beam.  This will keep the higher geared reduactions 
and give you brakes 20% bigger all the way around.  Eric&amp;Barb
