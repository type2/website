Scott,
There is always that little bit that comes out at least.  Sometimes more.
JP runs a long line.  Seemed good to me.  I've started doing the same.
I coil the extra above the transmission.  I can get the engine out and
down, then disconnect the gas line.  It's much easier to do where you can
see it and also be above it instead of under it.
