Subject: Westy Paint-Sikkens or Special Kolor

I was thinking, if SK did in fact mean special kolor, and that is based on Kombi's being one color, except in the case of early Westies when they are painted in the two-tone scheme, then maybe the we should look at what is on the M-code plate for a Dove Blue Westy?  It's still a Kombi, but in this case it is the typical single color.  If the M-code plate still has the SK identifier in front of the color code, then one could assume SK refers to Sikkens paint.  If there is no SK identifier, then one could assume that it does in fact stand for Special Kolor, as in the case of a Dove Blue Westy (Kombi) it isn't a &quot;special color&quot; and the SK is not there to represent that.  Good logic???

Doesn't Kris Heinika (spelling is off I'm sure) have a Dove Blue SO-23???  Kris, you out there?
