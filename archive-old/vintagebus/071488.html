&lt;John,

&lt;Just Think about this----

&lt;One day --waaay back when you too were probably one of them &quot; pimpled
&lt;faced &quot; kids too---:&gt;)

&lt;Everyone has to start screwing up somewhere- and Lowe's is as good a
&lt;place as any I guess--



Friday ramblings/rants during lunch break:



I was lucky to get a job in a small family-run hardware store when I was
a pimple-faced 16-year old (before there were category killer stores
like bLowes or Home Despot).  I cringe when I think how ignorant I was
then, but it was a great education, and I learned a lot.



One time, a guy came in and asked for a six-inch joint.  So I went back
to my boss, and asked what I should do.  My boss showed me where the six
inch stove pipe was located.  Another time, a customer came in and asked
for a six-inch round bastard.  Back to the boss again, who showed me
that a round bastard is a type of file.  So when someone came in and
asked for a pack of rubbers, I went back to the boss to see what the guy
wanted.  Turns out that the hardware store actually sold condoms along
with everything else...



Anyway, after working there a few years, I figured I had learned enough
about tools to buy an old VW and work on it, but that's another story...



Still learning,

Russell
