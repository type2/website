&gt;One of the only complaints about the Bentley Manual is that it can 
&gt;sometimes be hard to find the info you need. [...]  This guy made
&gt;his own index for his T-I Bentley manual. He even put it on the net
&gt;for everyone to benefit from.  I was wondering if anyone has done
&gt;anything like this for their T-II Bentley.

When I got my Bentley a couple of months ago I was thinking the
same thing.  A quick search of the archives reveals a couple of
proposals for making an index but I can't find any information on
one for the '63-'67 Type II manual.

I think such an index would ideally exist in two forms.  One would be
plain text with a bit of HTML, like the Type I index you referenced.
This would be for online use, or for running it off in the default
font on an old dot-matrix or laser printer to keep with the book.
The other would be nicely formatted in PDF or maybe PostScript, even
in a similar font to the existing manual, so it could be printed out
&quot;nicely&quot; and kept with the manual.

So I have the same question as Rex, has anyone indexed the type 2
Bentley manual.  Plus another, does anyone know the name of the
font used in the Bentley manual, or a reasonable modern knock-off
of same?
