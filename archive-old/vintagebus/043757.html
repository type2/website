&gt;Here is a list of emergency parts and the tools we carry.

Comments: Wow!
Also see below...

&gt;25. Brake fluid.  The higher the number the higher the boiling point!

DOT-3 brake fluid is the most common and fine for VWs.  DOT-4 is not
too hard to find, has a higher boiling point, and is compatible with
DOT-3.  DOT-5 is NOT COMPATIBLE with DOT-3 or DOT-4 fluids; you have
to flush out the whole system before switching over to DOT-5.  I think
DOT-5 is silicone oil based.

&gt;38. Axle grease.  At least enough to repack one set of front wheel bearing 
&gt;for one side.

If your Bus has them, would a tube of CV joint grease be a good idea?
If you have a real bad one there's not much you can do but if you
discover a torn boot or something you can replace the boot and refill
the grease.  You'd also need the tool that takes out the CV bolts
(Allen or three-square) and a spare CV boot.  

For a swing-axle Bus maybe a spare axle boot would be a good idea.

&gt;41.  Vise Grip wrench about 7&quot; or 180mm long, and make sure that these are 
&gt;made by Petersen MFG. Co. of Dewitt NEBR. USA.  Craftsman of these bite 
&gt;chunks of meat out of your thumb webbing when tightened.

BTDT.  The release spoon/handle goes the wrong way on the Craftsman ones.

&gt;43.  Battery terminal cleaner brush type is about 3 Â½&quot; or 900mm long and 
&gt;costs about $3.00.

90mm.  900mm is nearly a yard long, which only really helps if you are
getting your batteries down at the Navy's submarine wrecking yard...  :)

Don't forget the fine list of VWX tools the list compiled a while back.
For real VW tools, the doc project should shortly have an announcement
about the famous &quot;Local Manufacture&quot; tools book - the scanning and
indexing is done and we just have to get it on-line.
