A friend of mine and I were talking about how we wanted to build a fast VW,
and thought of something. Is it possible to unhook the fan and
alternator/generator and run an electric fan? This is for entertainment
purposes only, :) Don't like the idea of race car engines and 5,000 mile
rebuilds. But just wondering if its the VW cooling system that works only or
if you could add a totally different one. Thanks.
