&gt; &gt;With all this talk about engines what is the average life expectancy of a
&gt; &gt;good rebuilt 1600dp or 1776dp.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You have no idea what a can of worms you are opening.
&gt; 
&gt; A 1600 dp is less likely to live as long as a 1600 sp. Cracked heads my 
&gt; friend. Although that isnt that big of a deal. It will still run.
&gt; They can be made to not break but this costs money. I know of a shop that 
&gt; will weld them and change the spark plug hole and guarantees them for 
&gt; 100,000.

I am curious whether the Mexican long-reach plug heads are more resistant
to cracking than the original German heads.  Does anyone have any
experience here?
