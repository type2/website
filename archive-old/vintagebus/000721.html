Hi Casey,
Make sure first.  You should have good heat with outside temps down to 
freezing.  

&lt;&lt;afterall, i do live in Minnesota. I have a gas heater, but i've explained my
 problem with that before (6v heater, 12v bus). i guess i'm looking for a
 quick fix until i get these other steps done.&gt;&gt;
Right then you really need to just get a couple of volt-drop resistors (At 
least one that can be adjusted.) and set it so that while the generator and 
heater is running the voltage getting to the heater is about 7-8 volts.  Had 
to do the same with our wiper motor in our 1960 panel van camper.  Or if you 
can find the 6-12 volt adapter kit for SW heater (Your's is one of these 
correct?) or just install a 12 volt gas heater of the same make.  
 
&lt;&lt;What do you think this 12v outlet setup will be able to power? charging of 
a laptop/video camera possibly? or maybe a fan for the summer? I may still 
install it if it can do at least one of these things. &gt;&gt;
Again you need to look at what wattage (volts x amperage = Watts!) the items 
are going to require, and probably best to install a second battery (Please 
get both into battery boxes to reduce acid damage to the bus sheet metal down 
to a minimum!) on the left side of the bus to keep it startable by opening a 
knife switch to isolate the second battery and electrical items if you plan 
to use these items more than a few hours with the engine off.  Then find out 
how many hours your second battery is good for at what amperage output and 
having an idea of how many amps output of your gen/alternator is another good 
idea.  Especially important the longer you want to run electrical items with 
the engine off!  If there is anything you can buy that runs straight off of 
12 volt the better/longer your battery will last.  Those 12DC to 120AC volt 
inverters lose electricity in the conversion and thusly drain the battery 
faster.  So start checkin out the RV places to see what they have.  Also 
remember anything that uses a electrical motor takes about twice the rated 
wattage to start said motor.  So if you use an invertor or are planning 
wiring to keep this in mind!  Eric&amp;Barb
       P.S. Checked the info we have for alternators.  We were wrong you 
would have to run not one but at least two extra alternators (with output of 
50amps each.) to just run a 1,000 watt heater all the time.EEE&amp;B
