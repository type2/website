Subject: RE: [VB] Shocks for a 63singlecab

&gt;   I think Mexican Boges are made in the same factory as CoFap. I think these
&gt; shocks work great on a light bus. I would not use them on a Westy or camper,
&gt; or any bus that carrys a load. I have used them both in light duty buses
&gt; without a problem. They are just an oil shock and not a nitrogen filled
&gt; shock as GR 2's or gas-a-just , which in my opinion and experience give a
&gt; harsher ride in a light bus (S/C, empty panel van etc.)

They just seem too mushy and sort of lacking control for me. I think I
would accept a little bit harder ride. Hard to decribe really but maybe
boat-like gives the impression.
