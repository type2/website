 Anyone have a front shift rod for a early 66 For Sale? Mine is rusted
 together and it seems I'm going to have to cut the front one with a pipe

I suggest trying not to if you can possibly avoid it.  especially since you 
do not have a replacement.  Have you soaked with penetrating oil?  used heat 
and then squirted water to cool it?
