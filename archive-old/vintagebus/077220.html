Subject: HAC Family Picnic

The Houston AirCoolers invite one and all to our Family Picnic Sunday Feb 29,2004 at Cullen Park ,19008 Saums Rd on the west side of Houston just north of I-10 _at_ Barker-Cypress (http://www.mapquest_dot_com/maps/map.adp?country=US&amp;countryid=250&amp;addtohistory=&amp;address=19008+Saums+Rd&amp;city=houston&amp;state=tx&amp;zipcode=&amp;submit=Get+Map ) from around 11am to 3pm
This is not a car show or anything, it is just a picnic for VW people.... however if you do not bring your VW you will not be eligible for any trophies or prizes that may be awarded... so please bring your VW
The park does have BBQ pits if you like sort of thing ( I know I do!)
There are bike trails, kids playgrounds, picnic tables, and bathrooms (not port-o-potties)
It will be fun....
see you there



Thanks,

Brian
