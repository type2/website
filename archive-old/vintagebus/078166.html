Subject: Rebuilt engines

Hello All,

I'm currently in the market for a rebuilt 1600 engine.  I live in Norhern 
California so if anyone knows of a shop that does good quality rebuilds Im 
all ears-  someone suggested I call GEX (I think that is correct) but I have 
also heard not to-  also, what am I supposed to look for in a rebuild?  any 
information is good information so I appreciate your imput.

I was also wondering about front disk brakes with the wide five lug pattern. 
  Is anyone making them for type 2's?

Chris
