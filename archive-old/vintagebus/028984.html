In a perfect world, yes.  In the real world a mechanical regulator is MUCH
more fault tolerent than a solid state one.  

(Anecdotal evidence: Customer comes in with an early eighties Ford 3/4 ton
P/U.  No charge.  Wiring under dash MUCH modified over the years.  Solid state
(SS) regulator.  Fried.  Replace.  Charging system puts out 18+v for about 2
minutes then the new $85 regulator fries.  Check all wiring.  Test alternator.
Replace $85 (my cost, retail: $113. No returns on electrical items...) SS
regulator. Same thing. Two minutes. 18v. Toast. Replace $85 regulator with $12
mechanical regulator.  System functions properly. Still. Four years later.)    

If you don't mind, I'll keep the points. (and the FI.) If VW had wanted a SS
regulator on my '77 bus, it woulda shipped with one.
