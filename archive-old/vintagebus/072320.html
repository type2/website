Subject: Re: [VB] How to date a front beam?

Hi Rex,
Please at least stick with your own species!  Even the guy with the pig at 
least kept to something warm blooded!  ;-)

&gt; So...what beam do I have? The drums look like a '66 beam I've got a little. 
&gt; Is there a number or something so I can tell what it is? An other way to 
&gt; know for sure?


Best way to tell is by the link pin diameter and outer bearing cover.  Like 
the Bice bumbers we have not been able to find the ID number on a beam but 
&quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; list them.  

&gt; Is the steering dampner the same for all years? Is it the same as a bug 
&gt; one?
&gt; 
No it is not!
