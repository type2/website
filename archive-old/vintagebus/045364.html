&lt;&lt; BTW-- would the 205/75/15 fit my 59's wheel wells for sure ? Any other 
advice? I know Ive prob already asked numerous times . . . just want to be 
sure . . .(E+B?)&gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
Yup, that is the size for pre-late 1962 buses.  Unless your rear wheel wells 
are cut out, and the biggest that can be used on the fronts up into the 70s.  
It would be nice to find a 205/80/15 or a 205/85/15 for a slightly bigger 
outer diameter due to taller sidewall without a wider width, but no luck so 
far.
  Just try to get the highest load rating, as thin of profile as possible, 
and not to agressive tread unless you enjoy yelling over the hum of the tires 
at speed.  Remember there are P tires that have higher load ratings than some 
LT tires.
