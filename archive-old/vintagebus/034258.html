Everett,

I'm getting 13 - 16MPG now... with stock transaxle.  16MPG on highway at
4000 RPM _at_ 64MPH from interstate until running out!....  I believe I
currently have a 4.125 R&amp;P with .89 4th.

I will clearly report how my 3.44 works in comparision.  It will be another
30 to 35 days before I install the 3.44... but right after I install, I am
driving 1400 miles from Arizona to Washingtin, staying in Washington for 10
days, then driving back 1400 miles.  Long and boring trip, plenty of time to
play with speedo, tachometer, temp guage, and GPS.

In my 1963 Double Cab, going to the 3.88 and dropping 300 RPM at 60MPH and
gained me 2MPG on highway (at a slightly higer speed, I drove 65MPH with the
3.88 and 62MPH before)...  I also went from 30-pict TO Kadrons when I went
to 3.88.  So I can't be sure if it was the carbs or the transaxle that made
that difference.

Believe me, I'm wanting to get 20MPH on the highway at least... the dual
Kadrons are supposed to be excellent for improving MPG... maybe I'll get
22MPG on highway at 65MPH... If I had a goal, it would be that.  I also have
a full poptop Westy with roof rack (that had large blocky wind resistant
objects like gas tank on it when going on such trips).

Everett -- why did you drop the Kadrons?  There are a lot of reports that
the gas milage is much better with Kadrons... that could account for a lot
of your info.

I've been running a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th, Big Nut tranny with 195/75 14 LT
tires and a 1776 dp/30 pict-1/stock exhaust for some time in my '66 westy
and the best mileage I can get is 16, maybe 19 with a tailwind on a trip.
My daily commute to work yields 13-16 mpg at a steady 60 mph. I've tried
different jets, carbs, distributors, checking for tight bearings, dragging
brakes, etc. to see if I could push a little more from this combo with no
success.  Even a recent head rebuild didn't change anything. (compression
is close to even on all cylinders-approx 125 psi)

I originally built this engine for a bug; sold the bug-kept the engine. I
didn't like the 4.37 R&amp;P so I tried the 3.88 thinking I had the torque to
take advantage of the taller gearing at freeway speeds and 13-16 mpg is the
result. It looks great on paper, until you actually get to experience it
first hand.  I think a well-built 2 liter with dual carbs might make a
better choice for a 'Freeway Flyer', but I'm not going there.

BTW, when I had the original transaxle, I was getting up to 25 mpg with the
same engine sporting Kadrons and single quiet muffler. When I changed
gearing, that's when the bottom fell out on my gas mileage. I think I'll
chock this up to experience, and I'm going back to stock gearing or at
least a 4.12 R&amp;P very soon.
