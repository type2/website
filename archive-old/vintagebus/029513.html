You might be crazy, but a 1600 DP will still fit in your truck. Be sure
to get rid of the beetle muffler. Either a bus muffler or a header that
doesn't hit the bumper will work. The choice is yours. You also need to
make sure the flywheel, starter, and bell housing are all the same type
depending on the voltage of the starter.
