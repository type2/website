&quot;I just did my first official mileage check and
averaged 20.7 MPG over to Bend (North Santiam pass
included).  This means that I get better mileage than
the Ford Expedition, Excursion, Lincoln Navigator,
Chevy Tahoe &amp; Suburban, Toyota Land Cruiser, Lexus and
even my friends 1999 Ford Explorer.&quot;

Just some input, we have a 1997 chevy silverado pick up, z-71, etc etc, all 
the works, : 29 mpg highway (pulling an 18' trailor with a 20'x4'x3' bin 
(for soybeans)going from Pittsburg to York Pa., over all the mountains, etc. 
  And, it gets 32 highway, without the trailor. this is 100% true, (its an 
automatic) we have measured the gas mileage 6 times.
