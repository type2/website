Im not sure,

i am not a lawyer, check you rlocal laws etc. but since motorcycles can
operate with no windscreen as long as they wear eye protection, i cant see
why a volkswagen would be any different...

In new mexico one is not required to have a front windshield to pass
safety inspection i've been told.  If someones car has cracked glass,
which wont pass, and they need to get their car inspected and legal, they
can either replace the glass or remove it.  Both legal there.
