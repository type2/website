Subject: Re: [VB] Removing Steering Column tube??

Dave,

It's a press-fit. You'd need to somehow remove and clear out the debris of
your tube from the box body, and then press in the new tube.

&gt; I bought a tight steering box today for my Bus.  Problem is the outer tube is
&gt; rusted, almost through, were it went through the floor.  Almost looks like it
&gt; may be easier to just weld the crack fill in the rust pits.
