Hi all,

Is anyone out there an expert on the history of early Sapphire (made by
Bendix) radio's for late 50's through early 70's VW's?  I'm going through
and sorting some older radios in my parts stash and I'm trying to figure
out what model radio's were installed in which year Beetles and Busses. 
Has anyone ever seen or created a breakdown of the above info?  For
example, what VW model year(s) was the Sapphire 1 radio installed in?  The
Sapphire 3?  The Sapphire 5?  etc, etc.  Is this info out there somewhere? 
I'm particularly interested in the Sapphire radio info, but perhaps info on
the other brand radios (Blaupunkt, Becker, etc) would be of help to others
too.

Next question, while crudely bench testing some of my earliest radios with
a 6 volt vehicle battery, wiring, speaker, and antennae, I couldn't get
either of my Sapphire V (5) radios to work at all, and they look almost
new.  Does anyone out there know if the Sapphire 5 is really a 12 volt
radio for 1967, and maybe that is why I can't get them to work with my 6
volt vehicle battery?  

I know that there must be someone out there who is has a &quot;radio fetish&quot; and
who might be able to provide a definitive breakdown of earlier Bendix
&quot;Sapphire&quot; radio info (model names, years installed by VW,  voltage). 
Also, does anyone have a site where wiring diagrams might be available to
be used in order to repair old radios?  Does anyone currently provide this
service, someone that can be trusted to do a nice job at a reasonable
price?

Thanks for the info and input,  

Bill Bowman
