Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

Sounds like a pretty good business plan. I'd definitely buy all my parts
from 'that' business.

Subject: [VB] Buying bus parts


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I wanted to soapbox about my shopping experience so far with
&gt; 'bus-oriented' retailers. I've included 'best practices' examples
&gt; (thanks to Ronnie and Ron).
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Conrad
&gt;
&gt; ----------
&gt;
&gt; First
&gt;
&gt; As a shopper, it is really hard when you (a) don't know what a part
&gt; looks like (b) don't know what a part is called (c) don't know what
&gt; parts or tools are needed to complete a job.
&gt;
&gt; You would think that a retailer would recognize this and make it (a)
&gt; easy to identify a solution to a problem (b) make it easy to identify
&gt; parts (c) provide guidance in completing a job.
&gt;
&gt; Calling someone to order parts and getting a 'duh' response doesn't
&gt; help. I'm the buyer, you're the expert, you've seen people order this
&gt; part before, what other parts did they need, was there any special tool
&gt; they needed, any tips on the repair...
&gt;
&gt; Second
&gt;
&gt; Make it easy to buy parts from you. You should have several different
&gt; ways to order parts - by phone, by fax, by mail, by web.
&gt;
&gt; I prefer web cause I'm a web developer, that's the way i like to order
&gt; parts. Some people prefer phone calls. Be flexible.
&gt;
&gt; You should have a website by now. Your website should be easy to
&gt; navigate, pages should load in 8-15 seconds, the buyer should be able to
&gt; find the right part or solution in less than 5 minutes. The purchase of
&gt; parts should be equally smooth.
&gt;
&gt; Outdated material on your website - like specials from August 2000 -
&gt; makes you look amateur. On that point, you should have something for
&gt; people to come back for - tip of the week, or tip of the month - repair
&gt; highlight of the month, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Third
&gt;
&gt; You should know what your competition sells parts for, you should know
&gt; how they sell parts, what the buying experience is with them - and you
&gt; should do better than them.
&gt;
&gt; If you provide methods of communication with your customers, you should
&gt; be responsive. If you have a core policy, you should have a notification
&gt; that you received the core, that they did or did not make it back in
&gt; time for a refund, etc.
&gt;
&gt; When people buy parts, you should be able to give them a shipping ETA, a
&gt; follow-up email or phone call if there is an unexpected delay, give them
&gt; a website or account number to check on order status.
&gt;
&gt; Reward your customers by not being a black hole. Let them know that you
&gt; will be at a show coming up, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Follow up with customers after they buy parts. Send them a 'newsletter'
&gt; or letter of thanks. Let them know if you have any new parts or
&gt; specials. Customers will reward you with purchases.
