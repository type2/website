To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I know of Steve Carrington's bus back from when it was
found.  It was from Washington..two guys had it...Eric
and ?? was their names.  They drove it across country
and took it to Bad Camberg to sell..but sold it in
England instead.   It was a decent body but missing
75% +++ of the westy stuff inside...I think they have
just the bed frames.  I have pics of this bus when it
was in its &quot;as found condition&quot;. I think I gave some
to Thom to put on his Westy page???

I also recall the 2 'geniuses' from PNW that found
this bus painted it and stripped out all the nice
original westy wood wall panels to relace it with
shiney new stuff uggGHHHHH!!!

Steve was on the list...he should be out there
listening?  His bus was one of the primered buses
originally...not sure if those guys re-painted the
front area or not.  But I do have pics burried
somewhere of the interior beforehand.

&gt; Idaho or E WA is where he got his bus, (dry, unlike
&gt; here).  I saw it at Bad 
&gt; Camberg, and it is nicer than the pics I had seen.  
&gt;    I dont have contact 
&gt; info, its in my dead computer
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is that the one originally from the PNW?
&gt; I think i've seen photos, anyone have contact
&gt; information?
