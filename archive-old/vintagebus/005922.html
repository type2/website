I believe that it is for the front window on a bug as I saw these for sale
at BFY in CA a couple of years ago.  They suction on to the window and you
drive looking through it but hey it would work on the back of a bus too as
long as the window is flat it should work.  Contact BFY for more info as he
had quite a few.  Seems like he only wanted $30 or so but I could be wrong
about the price
