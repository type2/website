Greetings,

  When I took my bus into the garage for a resto(now going on about 3
months) one of the first problems I knew of was the windshield frame(the
gutter).  I could already tell that the corner of my drivers side gutter 
was missing a large chunk of metal so hopes were not good that the rest of
it would be any better.  I took off the tray and looked up and found that
amazingly the rust wasn't that bad! Very little rust and no where near
cancer. Yet neither the bondo nor sillicon could make that gapping hole
look normal.  I'd popped out my windshields got to work on cleaning up the
frames.  I broke out the wire well brush and got to work.  Straightaway, I
found that most of what was holding my window in place was bondo.  I broke
out the bigger grinder and skimmed off the bondo.  The metal that was left
was almost non-existant.  Somehow I was able to take out the remaining
metal just with my hands.  So it looks like I have no gutter(but
everything around the area(down on the nose, etc) is fine. 

So, replacement! I've got a few options here.  One, find a cleaner bus to
cut from. Two, can always go to Alan and Ronnie.  Three..and I'm not sure
about this one: Are the upper windshield frames the same as the lower? Do
you see what I'm getting at? I've got a bus here on the side of the house
with PERFECT upper frames(don't they all) while the rest of the body is
shot.  Could I be able to cut out the upper portion of the frames and then
use them as a lower section?(like of like what we were talkin' about with
the Double Door cargo doors.._dot_use the upper to fix the lower?).  
 
I was checkin' out my 64 and the upper frame as a little grove the the
bottom(I don't think) has.  Would that present a problem?  Anyone care to
add to this or lemme know if they have done this to fix the windshield
gutter?  Or if you just have advice on how to fix the missing gutter
lemme know!

p.s. I already checked out that baywindow on type2 windshield gutter
resto.  

p.s.s: Todd, I got the axle stubs off! Those snap rings are a pain but I
got them off. Yikes, those fulcum plates are cracked!  Thanks for the
help.
