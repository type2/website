Subject: Re: Grant steering wheel

  Back when I got Otto, my '62 he had a Black and 
polished Al Grant wheel. It sucked! Ugly welded and 
fabbed adapter raised the wheel a few inches making it 
look like a refugee from the teacup rides at Disneyland. 
The small diameter of the wheel also made for heavy 
steering, smooth leather-like covering was slick and the 
diameter of the grip was too fat (actually, I can't 
think of anything I'm fond of that's heavy, slick, and 
fat, but to each his/her own).
  Add to that the lack of a horn and signal canceling 
ring and it made for one sucky wheel. As soon as I 
located a stocker I threw it in the trash so no other 
poor bus would be subjected to it.
  Thinking back to the character of the DPO, he probably 
put it on so he could drive while wearing handcuffs.

IMNSHO, YMMV,

Anyone seen a Grant steering wheel on a bus? Is an 
adapter used to mount it 
or what? I havn't ever seen an adapter to do this, so do 
you mod one or fab 
something up? Just curious.
