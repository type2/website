Subject: Re: [VB] Dove Blue touch up - OT guns

Just dont hit it with a pressure washer.  I will do a
rehab once in awhile on a house and I never use that
cheap-ass Home Depot Behr paint because it doesnt
cover well or hold up.  I will be curious to see how
long it last before it peels off in chunks.  Did you
know that name-brand manufacturers usually make a
cheaper, lower quality product specifically for Home
Depot?  

I must give you credit for not painting it like a
hippy bus however.  :-)

&gt; I'm doing a &quot;get it on the road safely&quot; resto job on
&gt; a '66 Riviera I 
&gt; rescued from a local salvage yard. It would have
&gt; been reduced to a heap of 
&gt; scrap metal if left to the sawzall packing locals
&gt; (including me) out in 
&gt; that yard.
&gt; 
&gt; So, the windshield rust has been conquered with
&gt; epoxy and POR putty. 
&gt; Stopped by the Home Despot behemoth to pick up some
&gt; rattle can blue that 
&gt; might match, but nothing close. At the counter pro
&gt; painters were getting 
&gt; their swatches scanned and gallons tinted to match
&gt; EXACTLY. So, I handed 
&gt; over the dove blue radio block off  (that didn't go
&gt; with the '60 DC to 
&gt; Robert Davis years ago) and the guy said the shine
&gt; (41 years old!) would 
&gt; throw off the computer. At my request he scanned the
&gt; back side and made up 
&gt; a quart of semi-gloss enamel. He dabbed a finger of
&gt; it on the plate and hit 
&gt; it with a hair dryer. Perfect match. So I'll brush
&gt; it on, sand it smooth 
&gt; and see how it lasts in Anderson Valley, CA with
&gt; it's new owner.  Today, 
&gt; after it dried, looks great, but a bit darker than
&gt; the sun faded paint. 
&gt; Buffing out will help smooth it out. $9  a quart. In
&gt; the interest of cheap 
&gt; touch ups or restorations, here's the secret codes.
&gt; Your methods may vary.
&gt; 
&gt; Behr semigloss, Accent base G (5670)
&gt; The label has the colorants on the left and columns
&gt; of OZ, 48 and 96
&gt; 
&gt; B - lamp black     oz=1  48=9   96=1
&gt; C - yellow oxide   oz=0  48=8   96=0
&gt; E - thalo blue       oz=1  48=29  96=1

&gt; 
&gt; p.s. Yesterday a local deputy sheriff, 26 years old,
&gt; was blown away by a 
&gt; burglar using one of TEN loaded guns he found in a
&gt; foothill home. Lock up 
&gt; your firearms, please. I know these hard working
&gt; people protecting homes 
&gt; while you're away and they would appreciate your
&gt; efforts, to say the very 
&gt; least. Yeah, the guy was a criminal, but he didn't
&gt; carry a gun into the 
&gt; home and now there's a wife and 2.5 kids without a
&gt; father.
