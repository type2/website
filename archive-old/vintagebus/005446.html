This is usually caused by holding the brakes while stopped after a long
brake application. It eventually will go away with more long brake
applications not followed by a stop. Not that you would go out on Saturday
and run down a hill with your foot on the brake all day. But normal driving
with slightly more aggressive braking for awhile will do it. If you turn
them to get rid of it, you take off large amounts of material on the narrow
sides and none on the stretched sides and end up with a useless drum that
will oval anytime you lay into the brakes. I have had ovalled drums several
times over the years after mountain camping trips and it has always gone
away in fairly short order by just braking.

&gt; The alternative is that you end up with slightly non-round drums, due
&gt; to heat-induced warping.  That greatly reduces the effectiveness of
&gt; your braking at all times, not just when the drums are hot, since the
&gt; warp doesn't go away.  As mentioned elsewhere, it doesn't take much
&gt; additional separation for the shoes to not make solid contact.  If
&gt; you've ever had &quot;jerky&quot; brakes, you've experienced the problem of
&gt; warped drums.  It's quite...intriguing....
