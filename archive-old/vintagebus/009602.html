Subject: looking for rear seat-back support brackets.

Hey gang,

The subject line says it all.  I'm looking for the L-brackets that hold the
rear seat-back up and in place.  I've got some in there now that I pulled
out of a bay-window but they look like cr*p and don't fit right.  Someone
out theres gotta have a pair of these things laying around.  e-mail me
offline if you've got some, I'll spring for whatever they're worth
+shipping.

thanks
pete
