Ben: A &quot;header&quot; bolt could be an exhaust stud,
or it might also mean a &quot;head&quot; stud. the exhaust
stud can be seen externally where the &quot;header&quot; or
exhaust manifold bolts to the cylinder head.
Best repaired with the exhaust manifold and muffler
removed.
The &quot;head&quot; stud would be a more difficult problem,
requiring removing the valve cover and the valve train
to examine the bottom row of studs, and removing the
engine shroud to check the top row.
This would also be indicated in decreased compression
pressure (test with gauge) and would be more easily
repaired with the engine out, removing the cylinder head
and sleeve from the affected location. The &quot;dunk&quot; sound
could also be a &quot; blown &quot; head gasket
Your mechanic is more than likely on the right trail, it's
just the &quot;dunk&quot; and &quot;header bolt&quot; terminology has us all
a bit confused.Is it more like &quot; rum pum pum Pum&quot; ? ! )
