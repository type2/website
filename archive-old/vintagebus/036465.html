Actually, &quot;Alberta&quot; came up on Thom's site. Yes Alberta is in the middle,

Could the &quot;A&quot; mean Atlantic?

could mean anything I guess,  I just thought it mean a port it was shipped 
to, which I though would be somewhere on the edge of an ocean, or with an 
ocean going port like Lewiston, Idaho.     Which Alberta isn't, but it could 
be Alberta,  I just was surprised because of that lack of ocean access.
