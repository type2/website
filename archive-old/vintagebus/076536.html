Subject: RE: [VB] friday question Greatful Dead song?

&gt; &gt; Looking for a G D song that is named or is in the
&gt; &gt; lyrics&quot;but I enjoyed the ride&quot;I would like to know
&gt; &gt; what cd it's on ? &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; hell it a bucket has it pretty close. &quot; i may be going to 
&gt; hell in a bucket baby, but at least i'm enjoying the ride&quot;
&gt; i can find it on something easier to get ahold of.


The studio version is on the CD &quot;In The Dark.&quot;
