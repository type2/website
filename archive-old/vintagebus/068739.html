&lt;&lt; El Viajero,
    Your bus sounds like it is very old, but proud.  It does not want 
 to reveal its age to you.  I suspect that it is like an angry clam who 
 will not open up.  Still, you need to wonder about the pearl inside.  
 These old VWs are very mysterious. Be careful because some are evil and 
 will eat your wallet.  These old clams almost seem to have teeth!

The thing is bus karma, man.  You need to get on the shared wavelength with 
your bus.   Thing about Muir's book is it really helps to show the way.   
plus it's been in print for 30 years so it's easy to find a used copy cheap, 
like in almost any second hand bookstore.

Ya, that VIN to the right on the flat/horizontal  surfaceto the right of the 
engine closer to the engine than the battery, use a rag and some simple green 
or cleaner and wipe it down, the digits are maybe 1/2 to an inch high,  the 
main thing is they aren't tiny.  Do you have to find the VIN to get tags on 
it?
