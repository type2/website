there probobly a seal leaking? Thanks  &gt;&gt;

The reduction box housings are cast iron and therefore are 
somewhat porous.  Also, the newest one from VW is from '67
and who knows when yours were opened up last, if they reused
the old gasket, or just glopped on some RTV and called it good.
Whenever I open them up I will 'paint' on some Loctite #518 sealant
onto the gasket surfaces before reassembly.  This usually will
take care of future leaks- but not always!
