Subject: Re: [VB] Threatcon &gt;BUS&lt; Definitions


&gt;THREATCON NORMAL: Applies when there is a general threat of purchase
&gt;activity, ie, you spotted a bus behind a fence.
&gt;
&gt;THREATCON ALPHA: Applies when there is a bus behind a fence with NO TAGS.
&gt;
&gt;THREATCON BRAVO: Applies when an increased pulse and dry mouth cause you
&gt;to crawl under the fence, check the vin #s and look for any papers in the
&gt;bus that would identify an owner.
&gt;
&gt;THREATCON CHARLIE: Applies when an incident occurs - like the owner of
&gt;property comes out with a shotgun; or worse, a smile!

&gt;THREATCON DELTA: Applies when you and the towtruck show up in the driveway
&gt;and the wife comes out the door with a frown :P



sorry, but if i want to see all the blow-em-up warmongering, ill turn on
the TV - this is a BUS list.
