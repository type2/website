Subject: Insurance for the Bus..And Garage Thread

Hi Real Bus People     Well that sucks...My insurance
has expired on Ol'No Name and the insurance company
never sent a notice of payment due for upcoming
renewal or pending doom if payment not recieved
by?Yep, I should have kept an eye on them and my paper
work ....Same company for the past 3 years...I called
them..Oh they want me back...for $300 a year..Hey that
is Crazy talk!!(haha)Maybe they did not like the low
rate I had...$200 bucks a year...Well anyways anyone
know of a good company that likes old dudes that drive
a bus when the bus feels like a ride? I am thinking
this time I will get a tow package just for the peace
of mind and a CB radio to call in on...breaker
..breaker rubber duckie here._dot_come on!Also any company
I should stay away from?..Superior Insurance Company
out of Alanta GA(empty gun rack for insurance rate
cut) are the ones that cut me loose without any notice
in the mail.And me without a ticket or claim for over
20 years or more.                                  My
2 cents on the low garage door thread...Ya got to go
in backward at speed then pull the E-Brake hard...That
will sit the back end down while compressing driver
and a big heavy co-driver to the backs of their
seats...when they pop forward that will push the front
end down as you slip under the door....How you get out
I have no clue...Most likely it wont start anyways.
 10-4 over and out

Mark and his under-repair(broken down)...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean!..Hey!..Why miss me when you eat your Breakfast?I am right here  http://community.webtv_dot_net/DakineYaMan/MarkmissingOlNoName Sea-Ya (:}
