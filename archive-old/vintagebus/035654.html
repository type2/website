&lt;&lt;  Watch out for the Bay market, ouch!!! 70 bay clean, not perfect sold
 for 4400.00 to Japan (took half hour to sell once sign went in window), 1970
 bay, new paint, tires, still needed interior work 3600.00 and of course the
 DC for 8 g's plus!!!! and to think of how many bays I've parted out in the
 last few years! My best friend from Cal. had his 68 DC parked there and the
 Japanese were waiting for him to show up to try to buy it and IT WASN&quot;T F/S
