&gt; you can get an original gas heater that installs in the engine compartment.
&gt; Just my two cents;

Problem with the original eberspachers is that they arent terribly
efficient.

I am looking for something i can run all night long without draining my
battery or my gasoline (well ecessively anyway... the new espar sips it,
you can leave it on all night long on low for about a tenth of a gallon of
gas.)

take care,

Steve
