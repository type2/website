was writ:


The reasoning behind my just ordering the lower bearings was that I
reckoned that since they support the weight of bus on the axles
(incidently, I'm running 15&quot; bug rims, which are offset out a little
bit, and therefore stress the bearings out that much more), and the
upper bearings don't, maybe it would be ok to just replace those for
now. As many of you have found out by now, those puppies ain't cheap. It
hadn't really occurred to me that since those two gears mesh, if one of
them isn't right on, it's gonna stress the other one out (and the
bearings, too). 

At any rate, I gotta do something pretty quick. 
 -- - -  - -- 
well, since they are really a PITA to replace, it seems best to follow the 
advice in &quot;Do it Right&quot; by Arnott et al.    You don't really want to take the 
bad ones off, then put them back on, then take it apart to repace them when  
you had already done that work.    And FWIH, the upper outer bearing goes bad 
first.
