Hello,

I have a 1961 bus with no gas gague and have found that a gas gague is a
luxury item and not really neccecary.

Carry a 1 gallon can of gas with you (if you have no reserve tap), figure
out your approximate range per tank. i/e fill it full, drive maybe 200
miles, fill it again.

See how much gas it takes.  divide that out and you get your mileage.

Then your odometer is a perfect gas gague, i just try to fill up about 40
miles or so before i will be empty.  Works a charm.  Highway and city
mileage may be different, so keep that in mind.  I even try to fill up at
even mileages so the math is easy.  Like right now i am due to fill when
the odo rolls to 97,000.

After a few weeks of practice it becomes second nature.  But if you only
drive your bus once every 2 months you'll probably forget.

If you are really worried, get your fuel reserve tap in good working
order.  That way if you forget to check your odometer and run out of gas,
you pull the knob and get an instant extra gallon or two to get you to the
gas station.

take care,

Steve
