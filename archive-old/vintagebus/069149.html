Subject: RE: [VB] safari windows

I have Dave Palmer's Safari's, and I really like them a lot.

The set comes complete with everything, unlike some of the others.  By the
time you ad in what you would pay for all of the &quot;Extras&quot; with others like
Wolfgang's, Creative Engineering Safaris are not all that more expensive.

I got mine direct from England, and with shipping, they were still less than
$500 for the set.

I live in Southern California, and although it does rain here occasionally,
(in fact, it's supposed to this weekend), almost every bus owner who rides
in my '67 Sundial says, &quot;Boy, I wish I had Safari Windows&quot; when I have them
open and it's hot outside.

Good luck,
Ed
