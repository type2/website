&lt;&lt; Or, thinking new, has anyone mounted three-point belts in their split 
(like the non-retractors that Wolfsburg West sells?)? I imagine some welding 
is in order. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
DPO did by mounting the top end of the shoulder into the bench front seat 
backing sheet metal behind the walk thru seats in our panel.  Plus he did not 
install and large washers to prevent these from pulling through the sheet 
metal!  We are planning to cut and weld into all our buses the nut plates 
from post-1967 buses to prevent what is called submarining which 
pushes/twists you shoulder and back down due to the incorrect lower angle of 
the belt when mounted into the front seat backing sheet metal.
