&lt;&lt; The problem I ran into is the think thunks, not a loud knock.  It does it 
while just turning over and at an idle,but totally goes away at higher rpms?  
This kind of boggles me,most sounds like this get worse with acceleration not 
fainter. &gt;&gt;

Hi Carl,
We have had a sound like that and it turned out to be a connecting rod 
loosening up.  Would only make the knock sound when idling and when RPMing 
down with the clutch pedal down or just in nuetral.  It never made noise when 
accelerating.    Eric&amp;Barb
