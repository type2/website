I think it is a great idea.   That is what this list is about, helping each 
other out.  If Bus Depot is willing to take on that kind of headache to help 
the list out...   Why not let him.   I know if I place an order with Bus 
Depot I would definately add that to my order.

Whats the old saying......  Something about a &quot;gift horse&quot;????

I say go for it.   Any way to generate longterm funds for the list is a good 
thing.

Just my .02
Mike

 &gt; He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
 &gt; before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
 &gt; think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted
 &gt;

I dunno Ted, seems like a good idea to me.  Seems like an easy way to add
some bucks to our effort and we'll take all we can get.  Also helps
reinforce the ongoing nature of the fundraiser.  As long as there is the
disclaimer as mentioned I don't really see a problem with it, if the other
vendors want to start up similar programs, fine with me :-)

What do you other guys think?
