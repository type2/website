  This plate is attached with screws, not rivets, I am not sure it hasn't 
been replaced. &gt;&gt;
Hi Boyd,
It sounds like a late 1962 non-walk thru panel converted to a camper 
(Sundial, Riverara, Etc...).  Check that last number which should be the 
chassi number against the stamped number on the floor of the engine 
compartment to the right of the engine just forward of where the rear apron 
attaches to.  If they agree then most likely the ID plate has not been 
changed.   Eric&amp;Barb
