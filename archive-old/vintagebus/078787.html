Subject: '63 Camper(RIP) thank you.

Thanks Vintage Bus list for all the kind E-mails. My Son is OK on crutches,
stiches et. every thing still works !. The rest of the story---- After a
party---too much alcohol , he didn't spend the night and tried to drive
home, blood alcohol content .15  charged with DUI , he'll be without a
license for a while.Glad he didn't hurt anyone else.      Bus content--- I'm
stripping the Bus getting parts to save for the next project and I can't
believe how easy it was to pull the complete Wiring Works harness out-- took
like 15 min. it took me DAYS to put it in...Oh as a side note the large
washers I used when I put in the front seat belts streched a 6&quot; area of
metal slightly  but were not close to pulling through. Also having a sealed
battery (optima)kept the engine +engine  compartment clean (battery hold
down broke right off)  the battery was upside down.     Hey now I can look
for that '63 or older rust free Standard Panel with the walkthrough front
seats, double doors and factory sunroof  ...dreaming  in Eureka, Ca .
Lloyd
