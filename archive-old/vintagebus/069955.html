&gt; &gt; On my engine that came out of my bus, it has an original looking piece of
&gt; &gt; sheet metal that collects hot air exiting the doghouse and routes it out
&gt; &gt; through another original looking hole in the vertical piece of the front
&gt; &gt; engine tin.

and a very important piece of tin it is!  Without the duct, the heated air
from the oil cooler recirculates back into the air inlet, which is quite
bad for overall cooling.  You want fresh new air there, not air that has
already been through the oil cooler once!
