&gt;     I Need some information on this ad. by Wolfgang for a rear lowering
kit.
&gt; It say it eliminates reduction boxes. Will that Make a difference on the
&gt; FREEWAY?
&gt;       I'm building a 1835cc for my 65' Dlx. I don't won't the engine to
heat
&gt; up when I'm on the freeway will this work? Or what would be the best way
to
&gt; go about it.  Aloha Mike

Mike:

The kit they are selling was designed right here at Bus Boys back in the
80's.  We still sell the kit, only ours come with NEW spring plates rather
than cut up used ones.

We recommend that you use a type 3 or 68 Bug transaxle with our conversion
kit. If you want to stay with the wide 5 lug bolt pattern, use any of the
following brake setups:

1) Early Type 3 complete (the best)
2) Early Bug Complete with a spacer for the drums (the worst)
3) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with machined 63 and older Bus drums
(good)
4) Late Bug backing plates, shoes etc with Thing rear drums (good)

The kit is designed to safely lower the rear of your Bus about 3.5 inches.
Using the Bug or Type 3 trans will give you gearing better designed for
street and highway driving, but will limit your ability to haul loads of
cement up steep hills for long distances. Most people interested in lowering
their Bus are not using them as workhorses anyway.

Using your original Bus trans is not recommended as the best choice. The
gearing is not very good for use without the reduction boxes. You would also
have to remove the ring gear and install it on the other side of the trans.
Otherwise, you will have 4 reverse speeds and 1 foreward.

We have sold hundreds of these kits over the years and have not heard of any
reports of premature bearing wear or any other failures.

Thank You!
