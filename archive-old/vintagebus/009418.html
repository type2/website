Hi

I finally got the pictures from my friend with the high roof, that is for sale. They are taken in rainy/foggy conditions so they are a bit blurred. But you should be able to tell that this is one nice bus! The black/white picture is of my friend's last bus, I scanned it because it is identical, and show the &quot;door&quot; open (This bus was sold to California).
