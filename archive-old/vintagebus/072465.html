&gt; Hiya list,
&gt; Does anyone know of a lock for the early bus racks, the ones with the
&gt; horseshoe-type clamps?  Since they have a wingnut bolt that screws down into
&gt; the clamp, I can't use the normal types of locks.
&gt;
&gt; My son's 66 Sundial has a half-rack, the same kind of early rack as mine.
&gt; It has a link of chain welded to each of the wingnut screws, and a lock
&gt; placed thru the link of chain and locked onto the foot of the rack.  Pretty
&gt; simple, but it works.  I'd like to be able to disuade thiefs with bolt
&gt; cutters as well.  Any suggestions?

If they are willing to use bolt cutters, they will just cut the drip
rail!

I think that locking the wing nuts (or replacing the wing nuts with
something that requires a tool) is probably the best level of
protection.  It keeps the honest people honest.
