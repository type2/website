 Yea, safaris leak and have problems and can make
 driving uncomfortable on the occasional rainy
 day...but if comfort is what one wants why the heck
 would anyone drive an old split bus anyways! With
 Safrais or not they leak, are slow, ride like crap and
 are costly to restore...;-)

like I said, climate has a lot to do with it.  the occasional rainy day!!!, I 
guess its almost always 90 degrees in Ohio?     If it is when you drive your 
bus yes they are nice, but I took them out of my driver because I drive it in 
the winter (no salt here folks) and I only used them sometimes in the summer. 
  It was not worth the rain 300 days a year dripping all over everything.   I 
wanted to spend time/money on getting the bus drivable rather than fixing an 
accessory.  If I lived in Bakersfield, I'd have kept them.   If I lived in 
Pasadena, where my bus used to be by the CALIFORNIA NATIVE sticker on one 
safari and the tuneup tags from a Pasadena dealership in the doorjamb, I'd 
have kept them.  If I only drove it in summer, maybe ditto.   But I drive it. 
 In winter.   don't think a bus has to be real expensive (except bodywork 
&amp;paint), or extremely slow (depends how fast you like to drive, and what 
gearing your bus came with) or drive like crap.   Then again, on the occasion 
that I drive someone else's split, I usually think oh sheet, it needs this or 
that, cause I do feel safety is important and comfort and warmth, and believe 
in catching up on maintenance, but then again I am not paying shop rates for 
work, just my time and I like tinkering on the bus.  Let a friend of a friend 
drive my 65 , he said it drove like a Cadillac, though I think the steering 
is a little sloppy and it needs shocks, it still drives fine.    I dislike 
the romanticism of the crappy driving bus.   Yes, it looks like a box and it 
drives like a truck, but a good bus doesn't drive like crap.   Bad brakes are 
stupid.  If your steering wheel has a quarter turn of play, that was not in 
the bus design.   If you have no heat, ditto.   No it is no luxury car, but 
it doesn't have to be a POS.   If a bus drives like crap odds are it is 
because of 30-40 years of reduced maintenance, rather than the integral 
vehicle itself.  so I say if you really think that, take a good look and 
think what you need to fix your bus.  Yes it is really hard to get everything 
perfect, but forget paint and cosmetics and safaris now, I mean mechanicals.  
Okay it won't be like new.  Best driving bus I ever drove had about 40K km on 
it, drove nice.  guess they were better before being thrashed.  scuse me for 
the rant, it is kinda a pet peeve of mine.
