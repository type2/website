&lt;&lt; well, thought id check once more, i cant believe nobody has a rear apron 
for 
 my '66. i could use a deck lid too. anyone know what the repop deck lids or 
 aprons look like?
 thanks,
  &gt;&gt;

is your apron completely missing, or mangled?  I have a fair one, which is 
missing the screw on latch bit (to be found perhaps on bay window apron?)  
but you can probably find one closer
