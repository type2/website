I would go for a tent with a floor, drive-away optional. Just as long as it
looked  'somewhat' vintage...  More for function than originality :)

&gt; &lt;&lt; Maybe Dan's talents would be more rewarded if he broke into something
&gt;  different.  How about westfalia stuff?  Seems someone is always looking
&gt;  for poles and/or mounts.  I for one would buy a repro westy setup to
&gt;  hang on the panel.  I think a tent is a MAJOR value-add to  a bus. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the input.  Safari's were just one of many ideas.  My thoughts
&gt; were about making some that didn't leak but that would necessitate a
design
&gt; change.  I was just curious as to how deep the &quot;Vintage Nazi&quot; blood ran
and
&gt; what the tolerance is to a variance from stock appearance.
&gt;
&gt; As far as the tents...funny you should mention that.  My neighbor is a
&gt; seamstress who makes most of her money from making wedding dresses.
Surely
&gt; tents are easier to make than wedding dresses.  We have been talking about
&gt; doing some VW tent stuff.  We are checking into the cost of industrial
&gt; machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent
&quot;have&quot;
&gt; to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent
that
&gt; is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with
&gt; floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Also, looks like I am going to sell my '53.  In away I kind of hate to, I
&gt; really like it.  But bottom line is it rides like a John Deere tractor
which
&gt; all but rules it out for long distance trips which is what I enjoy most
about
&gt; my VW's...that and of course other financial priorities.  I have the Binz
for
&gt; long trips and can't really justify having a BD just for the around town
&gt; stuff.
&gt;
&gt; Info on the '53 in next message.
