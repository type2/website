&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I have a question about transmissions.
&gt; I have a 62 single that has a big nut tranny, with a 1600 dual port bolted
&gt; to it , I have never driven this truck but the PO told me that it popped out
&gt; of several gears and you had to hold it down on one of them. I need to get
&gt; this thing going as a work vehicle and I need a tranny. I have heard of
&gt; folks putting bug and type 3 swing axel trannies in their busses.   Is this
&gt; a feasible thing to do, What about the reduction boxes, do I just remove the
&gt; axels at the tranny and reattach them to the type 1 or type 3 tranny?

If you put the bus axles on a bug tranmission, you will find that you now
have 4 speeds in reverse!

To convert, you need to flip the ring gear around to the other side to
reverse the rotation of the axles.  I believe that this is an operation
that requires expertise in setting the gear backlash, and, I suspect, some
special tooling.
