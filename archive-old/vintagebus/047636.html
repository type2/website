 However, now I'm a bit confused. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
No problem!  We forgot to mention that the staight 40HP tube was used in 1963 
optional 1500 and was used into 64 or maybe 65 model years.  Then the paper 
preheat tube had to go from the left of the engine to the aircleaner on the 
right.  To do this and not get the tube caught by the crankshaft pulley VW 
installed a curved hook screwed to the center of the rear engine tin.  Bet 
the photo you have is from an earlier VW bus!  As for the preheat tube coming 
from the left heater we have only seen this used in the pre-15DEC62 built 
buses with stale air heat.   Eric&amp;Barb
