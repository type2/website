Ummm, these various numbers and stats are all very well and good, but
how many of you have A) had your odometers calibrated, and B) had your
speedometers calibrated?  Without the first, you don't know how far
you are actually driving, and without the second, you don't know how
fast.  For instance, given the optimism of the typical VW speedometer,
you're probably only doing 5/6 of what you think you are.  Similar
arguments apply to the odometer.  I used to think I was getting pretty
good mileage, until I clocked the odometer against the mile
markers....
