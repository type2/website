&lt;&lt; You say &quot;just like the later only a 24% reduction&quot;...so you really mean 
exactly the same only different?  Huh?  Thanks, but now you have to give me 
even more info. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Yes!  The two pairs of these reduction boxes we have dealt with use a longer 
stub axle with a same size, same toothed gear on it, and small early spiled 
shaft for the brake drum.  Which in turn uses the early style (1955-early64) 
of reduction bearings.  The upper gear is completely the same as the later 
1964-67 upper gear.
   This reduction box set up uses a special inner, and outer reduction box 
halfs.  The inner half has the threaded wheel cylinder mounting bolt hole 
lower to mount the late 1964-67 bigger diameter brakes, and has no inner plug 
to remove a nut off of the inner end of the axle since these reductions are 
setup with the earlier version bearings.  The outer half is cast/machining to 
use the smaller outer lower earlier bearing.  While the outside half has the 
casting/machining for the later lower wheel cylinder mounting bolt, the later 
upper studs, and one pin to mount the late 1964-67 brake backing plate, and 
late 1964-67 brake parts.  The brake drums are the larger wider later 1964-67 
type, but have a 1955-early 64 small diameter spline bore!  Which are 
dangerous to install on earlier brake setups due to being too big inside 
diameter for the earlier shoes causing blowing of out the wheel cylinders!  
These brake drums, and reduction box halfs have a &quot;D&quot; designation at the end 
of the part numbers that are also cast on them.  Unfortunitly the stub axle 
does not have a part number cast in it most times.  So is all too often 
noticed as really differant when trying to install the 1960-early 64 upper 
reduction gear or when installing the 1955-early 64 brake drum to find the 
axle stick out about 1/8&quot; to far to allow the axle nut to tighten on the drum 
properly.
