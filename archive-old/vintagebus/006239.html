Subject: Re: [VB] Blowing oil

I have the same problem (2110 cc). It's caused by high crankcase pressure
from the large displacement. Besides making sure that the case is well
vented, you will probably have to add a sand-seal pulley kit because the oil
is being forced out past the slinger washer at the pulley end of the crank.
The pulley then throws a fine mist of oil all over everything.

BTDT, still fighting it.

Subject: [VB] Blowing oil


&gt; I recently purchased a 1961 camper with an engine that had been rebuilt by
&gt; Andy Brown Automotive in Utah.  New engine is 1910 cc w/ dual Weber carbs.
&gt; Probably too much power for this van.  An external oil cooler and oil
filter
&gt; were also added.  Anyway I had the vehicle inspected prior to shipping to
&gt; Massachusetts and there were no issues.  After running it a day or two I
&gt; noticed oil in the engine compartment, a thin layer everywhere.  I
tightened
&gt; all connections to the oil cooler etc, but still oil in the compartment
&gt; after each use.  Any thoughts out there?  Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.  Don.
