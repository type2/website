Natural Bus 2004

With the impending addition to the family, Naturalbus has been slated as
our last bus event of the year for quite some time. I still hope to make
some later ones, but sure can't promise things like that with a new baby
hanging around :) Since it was our last one we were all looking forward
to having a nice weekend, soaking up the sun and the amazing views that
Western (not West) Virginia has to offer. 

Steph and the kids picked me up at work ready to go around lunchtime
Friday. We took off as quick as possible, to avoid getting hooked into
anything else at work. Took I-40 east (but what's new here) until we got
close to Crossville. There the construction was in full effect and put
us about an hour behind schedule. Finally got out of that stuff and
headed on toward Knoxville, with no more stops. Around dinner time we
took a road break and had some burgers, then off we went again up I-81.
I have real mixed feelings for this road. It's really a pretty
interstate, but quite hilly and heavily traveled by semi traffic. Being
fortunate on this trip, the semis were down in number this time. As we
made our way into Virginia, the threat of rain seemed to grow every
mile. I had been watching some clouds develop to our north most of the
trip, but it didn't seem very menacing or dangerous. Apparently the
really mean clouds were hanging out over the hills.

As the sun set and the rain started everyone reminisced about our last
trip to Naturalbus where it rained nearly the entire trip up there. By
this time the truckers must have finished the meat and three at the
stops and were back on the road in force. Always nice to share the road
with some of those guys on a rainy, hilly, dark interstate. After the
constant companionship of these fellows, I was sure glad the trek was
near the end and we pulled off the interstate to some more bus friendly
highways. Fortunately we knew the way, so finding the campout was easy.
I pulled into a soaking wet campsite around 12:30 and found Mark
cowering under the front porch (just kidding, he was hanging with his
wife). I made a quick walk around the camp to find a site, and got a
chicken wing shoved in my face. I took care of that problem as quick as
possible and wish I could have stayed around for more, but the family
was waiting for me in the bus.

I couldn't really find a good spot in the rain, but recognized Jamie
Auch's hightop, and pulled in next to him. We immediately sat to getting
ready for bed. This proved a bit harder to do than usual. Only things
that couldn't get wet stayed inside, but that added up in a hurry, and
since we didn't have a definite location for setup I didn't want to
setup the side tent. A bit later we settled on getting most of the stuff
pushed out of the way and got settled. If you think those westy beds are
small for two people, try 2 adults (1 is pregnant) and 2 three year
olds. Wyatt was lucky and got his child cot location, but everyone was
packed. We actually had to sleep feet to head just to be able to fit.
Not a comfortable arrangement, but it was better than just getting soaked
in the rain.

Sometime in the night the rain stopped and we woke to a somewhat cool
moist day that seemed to be just brimming with adventures to be found. I
spend the early morning moving the bus over so I could setup the tent
and setting up camp. While working on the my fellow Moonies were working
hard cooking breakfast burritos. The remainder of the morning between
eating and setting up camp was spend telling the kids no :) First thing
Wyatt did was hook up with Tanner, and the two remained mostly
unseperated the rest of the weekend. After breakfast we went down the
the campground pond to play in the sand. The kids slowly got wetter and
wetter, before I knew it they were running in and out of the pond, to
become completely soaked to the bone. Since I had obviously lost my
parenting skill of keeping them dry, I went ahead and let them play for a
while before lunch. Lunch came and I had to drag many unwilling kiddos
up from the water to try off before the kids activities. The sun had
finally made its appearance by now and the day was looking fantastic. 

The kids had a great time making bead necklaces and key chains in the rec
center. While the adults watched and threw some help when needed. Armed
with cool beads the kid krew launched another assault on the pond. this
time Steph had the bright idea of actually putting them in bathing
suits. While the kids played the Hillbilly Puttputtputt tourney was going
on. I didn't play this year, but it was quite the turn out. Lots of
people playing for Ronald McD's house. I spend the remainder of the
afternoon sitting and talking while the kids played on the beach. One of
those present was none other than Chris Cybulski, who was on a mission
to disprove the theory that he never leaves NC on bus trips. Also
showing off his nice new EV with bling (chrome) rims, that unfortunately
don't spin :) As dinner approached the quest for the best pasta at
Naturalbus was in full swing. Everything smelled fantastic everywhere
you walked. 

The judges did their thing and opened the flood gates to the public. We
did our best to devour all forms of high carb food, and it sure looked
like everyone was happy and stuffed. With the threat of rain the DJ
didn't want to have his gear get wet, so the beach party/award ceremony
was moved indoors later that night. I visited around before the award
ceremony and helped with kid duty till that time. 

Every conversation I had that evening usually had a story of what we
would do with the tye-dye engine that Mark had brought for the raffle,
So everyone was quite excited to see who would take that beauty home. At
the awards the campout prizes were handed out to some well deserving
folks. And the door prized were spread around. Lou won some cash in the
50/50, and my camp neighbor Jamie won the 1700 engine. The remainder of
the entertainment was a group of people hula dancing. During the
performance somehow I managed to get selected to share the stage with
some other campers. I didn't feel too bad since Hula Lou was gonna be
center stage. I did my best to shake my money maker and had a great time
acting like a fool. After the dancers were done I headed back down the
the camp to help out with the kids.

Steph and the twins hit the hay early, but Wyatt and me were all around
the camp chatting. I spent most of the time at the fire chatting and
having a really nice time visiting with those I had not seen yet. I
turned in 12ish and had a much nicer sleep than the previous night.
Sunday morning we woke to fix some breakfast and then break down camp.
This took a lot longer because lots of people I had missed Sat were
milling around and I chatted a lot. We eventually got ready, and decided
at the last minute to pass on the carabus, so we could get home before
2am for once. The trip home was uneventful. We just drove and stopped
when we needed. Had lunch in a Cracker-Barrel parking lot picnic style
and enjoyed the rest of the weather on the way home. Pulled into the
driveway around 10 ready to crash in bed. 

This campout is a great time. Lots of stuff to do and see, all in the
beauty of nature. We'll be there next year for sure. Congrats for the
Naturalbus team for raising over $1000 for the McDonald house.
