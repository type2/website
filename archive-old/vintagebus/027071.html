Subject: [VB] Re: mailing list question regarding SPAM

Just my two cents about Spammers on the list.

I agree that there should be a way to differentiate the dealer messages
on the list from the others on the list.

However, I especially like the fact that I get these parts updates and
specials on the list: I even look for them (though I havent yet made a
purchase). But the dealers should also be aware that it is a double
edged sword. 'Cause I know that any listmember that is dissatisfied is
sure to let others know the specifics of the transaction or substandard
part.

And, I guess that is one of the appealing things about buying parts from
list members such as Ronnie or Jerry Jess or others. Because how often
have we used mail order only to find out much later that we have been
had??!! And there is no way to let others know about it. In the old
days, when you bought from the local merchant, every one in town knew
his reputation. This list and the internet allows that idea of
accountability to at last come full circle again.

Perhaps there is a way to add an individual filter to the list. Any good
programmers out there with a suggestion??
