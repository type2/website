I have recently moved to the SF Bay area. I just moved here from Long Beach

I need a mechanic for my buses. I am in dire need of some transmission work
and

I have no idea who to take it to. I have had an estimate for my 64'

split-window camper. I was told it would cost about $1400.00. I think this is
a

bit steep. I think the transmissions should cost about $400.00 rebuilt but I

may be wrong.

If you take the enigine and tranny out , and remove the axles, it would cost
circa $300 for the center section rebuild.   Axle to axle about twice that, I
think.       I think parts are getting more expensive.   About 10 years ago I
called to find how much it would cost to get the tranny rebuildt in my 59-
split case.  Was $750 if I brought it to them.   Think it is nearly twice that
now.    I bought a parts bus with a good tranny instead, and switched trannies
in the dirt while going to school full time, working part time,  and spending
2 hours on the bus each way to get to school and back.   I had to go rent drum
pullers, too.    I missed the best party (Eviction party at my previous place)
because I couldn't get there as my bus was down.     (Eviction happened as 'no
major mechanical repairs' was specified in the lease, it was a house of VWs,
and during spring break Engines got pulled, replaced, and othe stuff done, and
a bug was stripped, no doors or glass or anything left, then rolled round the
corner and left balancing on a milk crate as the wheels were also removed.
Of course, I don't know who was involved with that.    Some landlords are real
uptight)

But sorry, I don't know of mechanics in the North Bay.
