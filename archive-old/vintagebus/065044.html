&gt; what is a come-along?

A come-along is a small winch that has a hook on one end and a cable and
hook coming from the other.  You hook the hook to the bus, pay the cable
out, and hook the winch to a stationary object.  You then operate the
handle which reels in the cable and unsticks your bus.

Safety first, though.  Never stand in line with the cable, as it turns
into a steel whip if it breaks.  An old trip is to throw an old towel or
blanket over the cable to absorb the energy if the cable breaks.

Come-alongs come in various sizes.  The little cheap ones aren't strong
enough to pull a bus out of a hole.  You get what you pay for.

Better than a come-along is to make sure that you don't get stuck in the
first place.  I'd rather be driving than digging!
