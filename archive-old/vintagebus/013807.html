&gt; Actually, it got me wondering how the bay window buses were looked upon when
&gt; they first came out. Much as I like to see them on the roads, they're not as
&gt; good looking as a Split! Did the owners have the p**s taken out of them like
&gt; N** B****** owners do in the UK by the air-cooled vintage snobs.(Like
