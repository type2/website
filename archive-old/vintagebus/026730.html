&gt; Jack is right ,the southern most US city is in Hawaii! Ka'u on the big

Woo Woo! I was actually right about something! 
I guess it is true that even a dog's (edited for family viewing) gets a
little sunshine now and again!

One question, though, if Key West is an Island, and Hawaii is 7 islands,
how is it that one is considered part of the continent and the other
isnt? Is it a continental shelf or plate-techtonics thing?

Or is it that you cant drive your (BUS CONTENT!) bus to hawaii?
