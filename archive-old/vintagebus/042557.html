hi all,

I have noticed a recent trend lately... Everyone is driving cars other
than busses it would seem.

Have we moved into a new era where busses are for shows and garages and
other cars are for driving?

Some of the greats in bus-lore have jumped ship...

Trailering Barndoors that run fine to VW shows...
Buying mercedes diesel wagons to attend VW shows
A local bus-nazi preferring to drive to a vw event in a pontaic over his
bug..
fewr and fewer swap space participants showing up with busloads of parts,
more and more showing up with US made pickups of parts.

and the list goes on...

Am i cracked for only having busses to drive, have i lost my reason...
should i check into a rehab program now that i have finally sold my only
running watercooled car? (though i must admit to still having one that
doesnt work.. as it stands i have 1 WC, 2 split, 1 bay, 2 vgons, only the 
71 and 61 run.)

I know it cant be due to parts availability as most anything we could need
is readily available.  It cant be due to expense, as acvw parts are still
the cheapest thing going. (even one taillight for a new car is more than a
nice pair for my 61)  And i'd even doubt its due to rarity of busses, i
see plenty FS cheap that no-one picks up...

Help me to figure this one out...

thanks,

Steve

p.s. i _think_ this is a non-friday topic, if i am wrong please let me
know.
