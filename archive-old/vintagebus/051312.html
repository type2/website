Subject: RE: [VB] What exaust should I use? 

&gt; Yes!  A nice 1300-1600cc muffler for bus.  You will not get
&gt; the monoxide
&gt; poisoning behind your bus like you will with the bug muffler or most
&gt; extractor mufflers.  Also will run cooler, more torque which is most
&gt; important for a bus and MPG than with the extractor.

&gt; I am in total agreement.  I tried the bug muffler on my bus and
&gt; almost died  from the fumes.  Use a bus muffler with the side exhaust
pipe.
&gt; Spend the  money and get a good German muffler.  It will fit and last.


This might be a good time to mention that I sell complete 1500-1600cc bus
exhaust systems for $95 with listmember discount. This is the real German
setup - muffler, tailpipe, damper pipe, hardware, everything you need, all
100% OEM German Ernst/Leistritz.   Part # 211 251 053EC.
