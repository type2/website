&gt;This brings to mind a question I had about running original VW intake valves
&gt;with regular gas in a 36hp motor.

I always thought it was the valve _seats_, in the head, that were the
problem.  The early seats were made out of a softer material and the lead
in the fuel helped to keep the valves from wearing the seats down.  Seats
for unleaded fuel are harder and don't erode, even without the lubrication
from the lead.  The valves may have changed too, but I think the valve
seats were the big change.
