hello gang !!

This message concern my first VW, the 1973 one...

Few years ago i bought a porshe engine used (id no: EA XXXXX) .. and i just
got rebuild last week from a great guy here in Montreal area!!  Its in a
1700 case with 96mm piston, the guy who rebuild it also have a machine shop
(and a perfect 195X beetle) and resized my piston and now my engine is a
1915cc

Well my problem is my clutch !!
on the clutch we can read:

LukLamellenundKupplungsbauGmbH/Buhl
8a13
022141025A
1Q80

My question is about the screw that tied the clutch to the flywheel, they
are torque screw.. and i wonder where i can find a few of those screw ??  i
need 5-6 of them, otherwise what else can i use ??

Tx for all

Mike
