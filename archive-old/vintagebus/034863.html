&lt;&lt; If the gland nut has worked it's way loose would that cause end play?&gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
Yes! 

&lt;&lt;When I tug on the crank pulley I get the same amount of play. What causes
 excessive end play? &gt;&gt;
Worn out thrust surfaces in #1 bearing and/or the case area that this bearing 
rides in is worn.  This can be caused by uneven firing of the cylinders 
and/or slamming through the gears all the time.  Loose or broken flywheel 
gland bolt.  Broken crankshaft which is more common to these than 1500/1600cc 
cranks.  Eric&amp;Barb
