Subject: Re: Strange Ignirion Switch Problem

&gt;
&gt;Could be that the switch just gave up the ghost, and I have to accept
&gt;the fact, buy a new one and move on?

Probably.  I think the failure mode is that the holes in the plastic for
the switch terminals gradually enlarge over time - either by mechanical
action (operating the switch, vibrations transmitted to the terminals
by the wires) or heat (imperfect contact either inside the switch or
at the wire).  When the holes are big enough, the terminals inside the
switch can flop into each other or the metal housing.

You might be able to rescue your switch by epoxying the terminals back
into the base - I've never tried this.  I think you'd almost have to
have the cover off in order to get the terminals oriented correctly
before epoxying.  Then you have to figure out how to put the cover
back on.

&gt;Is this something that could have been caused by malice?  The bus has
&gt;been parked on the street - could someone have been mucking with it
&gt;and caused this (ever the suspicious one, I)

Maybe.  It sounds like you don't have the column-lock type, since you
could access it through the speedo hole.  If someone that doesn't know
Buses had tried to steal it, I'd guess that there would be marks from
a slide hammer screw or screwdriver around the key hole.  Someone that
knows Buses would have just hot-wired it, but if they were tugging on
the wires of an already-marginal switch, it might have made it worse.

Have you checked out the various for-sale sites for pictures of your
Bus that you didn't put there?
