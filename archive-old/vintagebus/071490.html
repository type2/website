&gt; I guess my point is that when I was a kid the drive to our destination was
part of the vacation. Modern
&gt; cars with all of the TV's , DVD players, GPS and other bells and whistles
take away from the adventure
&gt; of travel itself. I understand they are creature comforts and can make
travel with children easier but I
&gt; see them (gadgets not kids!) as distractions. If you are focusing all of
your attention inside the car, think
&gt; of what you miss outside.

I guess you haven't driven  up and down, side to side across Nevada or
Wyoming. Heck, even the view from the freeway going down Utah isn't much to
gander at. Open desert. It's only good to look at for a while before it
becomes incredibly boring.

I see what you're saying Sean, absolutley. My last out of state trip last
month, we took a longer way home just for the drive. We took I-89 up through
Utah instead of the I-15 because it took us up through the mountains. If
there's a view, i'll make my kid(s) look at it wether they like it or not,
but if it's a boring stinkin drive where the scenery doesn't change, and the
kids can't move out of thier seats, I'd be glad to pop in a movie for them.

I think the big picture is (or should be), that parents should raise the
kids, not a movie, or a book, or video games or whatever else is out there.
Those things should be side attractions to the big show. We all do things to
eat time. Ever take a nap while on a long drive? Same thing if you think
about it. Decide what your children can watch. I especially don't see
anything wrong with it if it's educational. Can I get the Nova program
linked right to a screen in my bus?  :-)
