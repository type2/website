Subject: Re: [VB] Carb problems solved, dealership rantings.

Stocker cam for me, I have been led to believe the stocker cam is good
for street use in even big motors. Stock rgb bus doesn't drag race
well anyway, I saw 18 seconds and 62mph at the 1/4 mile where the bugs
were making it in under 10 seconds and well over 100mph. But you can
love your honey in a bus without backache, so slow has its merits too.
Bus is best, at least until I can get a biplane...
