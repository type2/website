I guess it depends on how $$$ motivated you are and how much work
you wanna do.  If you do the part-by-part method, it's a little
easier on you than trying to pull out an entire frame and put in
a new one.  I guess you could dismember the donor frame and 
install it's parts piece by piece.

The repro pieces are not super cheep, but they're not horribly expensive.
There's several different sources, with varying qualities and prices.

&gt;   On that note: I'm able to get the complete bottom of a bus. Rust free from 
&gt; the southwest. I basically need the whole bottom for my DC, minus rear 
&gt; quarters. I haven't priced replacement panels yet. I can get the bus buttom for 
&gt; free if I go and get it. But that is like 1600 miles away. I'll have to store 
&gt; the thing because I'm no where near ready to start working on it. 
&gt;   My question is, should I use the thanksgiving holiday to drive 17 hours for 
&gt; the free metal, or just by bits and pieces as I have the cash and store them 
&gt; up. Keep in mind the bus bottom will be one complete piece. I'm really 
&gt; attracted to the free price. But are the panels really expensive?
