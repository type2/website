Subject: Buses, Bonfires, and BBQ Info  (Info for the east coast, looooong

This is info for the Assateague VW Bonfire get together in Maryland.

I'd like to plan this annually so if anyone has any name ideas, let me know.
Also, if anyone lives nearby, i would love all the local help i can get the
day of or up to the event.

I just got off the phone with Assateague and found out some info for our
gathering.

The first thing we need to consider is whether to have this in August or
September.  Please email me with your vote.  The Date i get the most will
win. Please choose a saturday, and Labor day weekend is out of the question.
Since I live here, I'll give you the pros and cons.

August..    
	Pros...  
		1.  Its definately warm
		2.  Its still summertime for those with kids who are
planning on attending, or those of you in school.
		3.  The ocean is warm.
	Cons...
		1.  Its peak tourist season.  The park could be crowded or
booked up for camping.
		2.  Bugs!!!   Mesquitos are still around during August and
if we end up without a breeze we could all be bathing in Bug-Off. So instead
of                                            		having events like
Bug-In and Bug-Out, we could name this one the Bug-Off!
		3. Traffic...  nough said.


September...
	Pros...
		1. Its the end of tourist season!!! :)
		2. There should be no problems for everyone to get a
campsite. :)
		3. Bugs!!!!  There wont be any hopefully.
		4. Not as much traffic.  Unless we choose labor day
weekend:(  I suggest we dont do that.
	Cons...
		1. Its still warm, but we could end up with a nice cool day.
Not so great for swimming.
		2. Could be inconvenient for those of you with school or
kids in school.  Then again, it will be a weekend.

Im sure there are other pros and cons, but those are the biggies.

Heres the Assateague Info...

		1. It'll be $25 to secure the beach area for the bonfire and
cookout.  No problems there.
		2. Entrance to the park is $7
		3. Single drive in campsites are $14 a nite.  2 vehicles per
site.
		4. Group camp sites are also available.  25 people or less
with no limit on vehicles.  I'll drive down there to take a look and see how
many vehicles can really fit.  There is bayside camping, and ocean side
camping.
		5. We can pretty much get any weekend for the Bonfire party.
		6. The cookout site is about 1/4 mile from the campsites.
		7. *****VERY IMPORTANT*****  all camping before october is
by reservation only.  Reservations can be made no further than 2 months in
advance.  Its really important we nail down a date as soon as possible.

**** IDEAS ****
For people coming from north of Deleware.  I believe Auker is gonna be
taking the Cape May Lewis Ferry over to Deleware.  This would make an
outstanding meeting point for all of you.  The ferry is a beautiful trip,
not to mention how cool it would be to fill the thing with wv's.   When we
decide on a date, maybe Auker could plan the Ferry meeting.

For people coming from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel side of VA, maybe a
meeting in Hampton would make a nice caravan for that part?  Any takers?

My VW mechanic has a pretty large graveyard.  Im gonna try to see if I can
get his weekend # for any mishaps anyone might have.

I'll add more to this later.
