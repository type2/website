&gt; By &quot;protocol&quot; I mean that anyone with a question or problem is supposed
&gt;to go through the Archives, Reference and Busted Bus sections, and their
&gt;personal manual(s) first. If they find no answer to their question, then
&gt;they are directed to post the question to the list server, where
&gt;everyone can read their post and answer to them, either by list or
&gt;p-mail.

One thing most everyone seems to forget; just because you have e-mail, it
doesn't mean you have internet access. I live out in the country and it took
quite a long while before I was able to get internet access. I was able
however to get e-mail. I just had to pay the long distance charges. You can
get e-mail only accounts at most internet providers for a reduced rate.

Just a thought,

Rick
