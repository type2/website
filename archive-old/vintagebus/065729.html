&lt;&lt; Does anyone know if all split window panel vans have side louvers
 towards the top and all others do not have these top louvers? I believe
 my '66 Kombi use to be a panel van in another life because it has the
 top louvers.
  &gt;&gt;
yes, bench seat panels have louvers near top.    The few bench seat panels 
with a special M code, other models,  and walk through panels don't .    You 
will probably find that yours is a 211 model if you look at your M-tag or ID 
plate
