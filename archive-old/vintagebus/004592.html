This is a post that I've procrastinated in writing and so I've finally
decided to pry myself away from the bus and write this.

Now before I get into the story, I'd like to interject a prequel.  Tonight I
loaded up a ton of stuff in the bus and hauled it out to the storage shed on
the farm where I rent space.  The usefulness of the old splitty came to fore
and I was really pleased.  I had so much stuff in it, I had to bungee cord
the cargo doors shut because I couldn't close them!!!  To top it all off, I
towed my recently acquired 72 Super Beetle into the field for a distance of
about 2 blocks while my dad steered the bug.  The old bus is being put to
use and the best part is I don't feel so bad for driving a beater.  Like I
had said before, I'm not going to baby my bus - it's gonna work like VW
intended it to.

On to the weekend trip story.

I've known Rob and Justin Laffoon of Omaha, NE for quite some time.  My
first recollection of meeting them was at a Omaha VW Show about 3 to 4 years
ago.  Rob and some other fella both had their orange baywindow westies
parked back to back with a full compliment of tents, swamp coolers, and the
whole shebang.  It was a hot day and Rob was kind enough to let me sit in
his tent and drink free pop.  Sometimes I think that's the only reason I go
to the Omaha show is so that Rob can pack my belly full of free pop. (Just
Kidding!!!)  Anyway, I never forgot his kindness and he evidently never
forgot me and we've known each other and been long distance friends and
email buddies ever since.

So it was with great enthusiasm that I drove my 67 bus on its maiden voyage
to Omaha to see Rob and Justin.  Of course it was windy as hell and I got
blowed all over the road.  I know I'm gonna have to replace that worn out
steering box and check the link pins.  It felt like I was driving sideways
at times but despite all of this, I was having a blast.  The engine was
pulling really hard but it never overheated - never even missed a beat.  Oil
consumption was under a half quart and I think most of that was leakage
anyway.

Rob got a good picture of me rolling into his driveway plus some other good
shots that you can check out at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/67bus/67busupdate3.htm  I was more than
thrilled to be their chauffer for the day - especially since they helped me
put in the trans - I can't thank them enough.

We drove around town attempting to meet some listees.  Terry Wolfe was out
of town and Dave Redding wasn't home either so we ran over to Mike Carroll's
place.  He was a really great VW nut to visit with and sports 2 of the
prettiest bugs you'll ever see.  His wife and him have done all the work and
really turned out some masterpieces.  If you click on the link in my sig to
the OVWC page, you can go to Mike's page from there and see his bugs.  Time
was tickin2g so we had to be on our way but not after getting an hour or 2
of dub chatting in.

That afternoon Rob, Justin, and I went to the Bensen suburb of Omaha.  This
little closeknit community was enveloped by Omaha's growth and has somehow
managed to steer clear of the cocky snobbish attitude that other sections of
the town exhibit.  The best part of the trip was when we went to &quot;Hargiss
stringed instruments.&quot;  Justin has been working here as an apprentice guitar
builder/janitor/gofer for several months and he's learning a skill that I'm
envious of - guitar building.  I was in awe to actually be in a shop where
guitars and other stringed instuments are built and repaired.  The owner
(John or Jeff - I can't remember his name - I'll just say &quot;Jay&quot; for
simplicity sakes) is one cool dude.  We were total strangers yet went back
and forth like we were old buddies.  I got to play his prototype back packer
guitar that he made out of scrap wood.  I kid you not when I tell you the
face of the guitar is made out of a cedar shingle!!!  What is amazing about
these guitars is they have a full size neck and frets (no ukelele toy stuff
here!) so they're easy to play but they sport a halfsize sound box with the
sound and tone being largely indistinguishable from a full size guitar.  I
had the priviledge of playing a BRAND new backpacker that Jay built from the
ground up.  It took 2 weeks to make.  Jay finished dresing the frets, strung
it up, and let me play it and I felt like I was playing a Martin.  I could
not believe it!
Jay had an actual backpacker made by Martin and the tone and soundbox design
were pitiful in comparison to Jay's design.  I don't know how he did it but
I think he's got a winner on his hands.  For those of you who play guitars
and would love to have a small one to tote around in your splitty bus, bug,
whatever, this is the ticket.  I guess this does sound like an advertisement
but I tell you what - I'm so thrilled with his little guitar, I'm buying one
for myself because it'll take up less room in the bus and I won't have to
sacrifice precious space nor sound quality when I sit around those VW
campout campfires.  Koom Ba Yah Baby!!!  I'll see if I can get some pictures
and sounds of it available for everyone to check out on my webpage but if
you want to talk to him, call him up at 402-558-9551 and have him play his
backpacker guitar over the phone.  It won't do it justice but you'll get the
idea.  BTW:  Part of his secret is actually using D18 neck stock - no joke
when I say it plays like a Martin!

Sometime during all of this awesome guitar scenario, we ran across the
street to the local Pizza joint (I think it was called King's Palace).  It's
more than just a Pizza Hut or chain store, it's more like you're friendly
neighborhood pizza joint where you go so often you don't even need a menu.
They know what you want and you know what they have so it all works out.
Friday evenings is when the local guitar crowd gets together for jam session
and you can tell because they keep a piano and stools in the corner.  It's
just a nice homey little section of town that seems much more content and
friendly than even small town hate mongering Beatrice, NE. As you walk into
this place, they have all kinds of neat displays up that seem to go hand in
hand with the old decorated tin ceiling.  My favourite display is the old
Schwinn style cruiser bike with 3 or 4 red colored bullet vaccuum cleaners
positioned to look like jet engines.  It sounds corny but if you saw it,
you'd see how it fit in with the decor of the place.  The whole lunch
experience was neat.  Rob paid for pizza, Justin joined us later after his
chores at the guitar shop were done, and we had a nice chat about
you-name-it.

With the clock still ticking, Rob, Justin, and I bid Jay adieu and headed
over to Jay's house to check out a couple of Baywindow camper interiors for
sale for $100.  It included 2 fridge/sink combos, 2 closets and one Z-Bed.
I passed on it but they're not in too bad of shape.  I'm kind of holding out
for a nice splitty interior either for purchase or to copy.

It was time to head back to Rob's house for a bathroom break, picture
session and to see Justin's impressive display of what was once a pile of
junk motor scooters.  Now he has a set of 3 running scooters, 2 of them are
old trail bikes (one's called a Go Devil made in Ralston, NE years ago) and
the most powerful one is a 125cc Honda scooter which looks like a total pile
of crap.  Justin even agrees that it looks like a junk pile but man does she
run.  It hauled my 300 pound set of buns up and down the street like Erik
Estrada in hot pursuit.  At his young age (13?) Justin is sporting some
exceptionally great talent in getting old engines and machinery to run.
He's going to have absolutely no problem getting a VW up and running one of
these days.  If you can get a lawn mower engine to run, you can work on a
dub.

Before I left, one of Justin's friends showed up.  They don't know that I
overheard them talking but I had to chuckle because I heard Justin
explaining to his friend about how come an aircooled engine was so much
better than a watercooled one.  He said (to paraphrase), &quot;...Why bother with
a radiator and water and all that extra weight when an aircooled engine will
work just fine?&quot;

I like that kid's line of logic.  His Dad has taught him well and with
thinking like that, well it's plain to see that he's got it in his blood
too!

I finally had to pry myself away and head for home.  I had a great time but
I was tired so it was good to get home.  The bus raked up over 200 miles
without a hitch.  I missed my turn on the way home and ended up driving in
Schramm State Park for about 20 minutes but it was a pretty ride.  I had so
many people giving me the peace sign, waving, giving me arm pumps and all
kinds of positive gestures along the way that I really didn't mind the
detour at all.  It was a great trip and I know for a fact that I'm
officially hooked on T2's.

Thanks for reading...

Later!
