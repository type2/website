 I paid $1.92 in Chicago today for the 87 octane stuff.  There is a convenience store/gas chain CASEY'S in IL that was gouging people for $4-5 per gallon and the State of IL is bringing suit against them.  We are at WAR, so that makes these people traitors.  Boycott them.  They deserve to go out of business.

WARNING: You will hear a &quot;buttload&quot; of propaganda in the next few months, 
years, decades. Take everything with a grain of salt, even my suggestions! 
Check several sources. Corporate sponsored media is one source, seek 
others. http://www.zmag_dot_org/ZNET.htm is only one. Listen to a non-corporate 
radio station, www.kfcf_dot_org . Just as I examine my personal bad 
habits/actions and correct them, so should a nation. If self-scrutiny is 
blocked, question the blockers. If you're coerced or gently led to follow 
the perceived majority, it's a big warning flag. This is a nation of 
patriots, not zealots... be involved in the decisions by being completely 
informed. My bus is slowing down? I'll buy a tank of aviation fuel and that 
sumbitch'll perform, or else. Get all the details before you make a 
patriotic choice.

&gt;We had rumors of $5.00 gas in Ohio last night which sent every one to jam
&gt;all of the gas stations in town. This morning gas prices are
&gt;unchanged...$1.66 to $1.89.
