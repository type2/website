Subject: 009 heads up

  Just to let everyone know that Bosch has discontinued the manufacter of 009 dizzys. The wholesale prices on these 
have risen dramaticaly in the last few weeks as the supply goes away.
   If any of you have even given the thought of buying or needing an 009 in the future BUY ONE NOW.  The best deal 
out there (I am sold out) right now is from CIP1, they list them at 44.95 plus a 5% internet discount and if you buy 2 
FREE FRIEGHT. This is not a plug for them just they have the lowest price now and do/did have them in stock.
   When these are gone your only options will be SVDA at 90 to 150 dollars plus, depending on vendor, new duel vacs 
at 175.00 or used/rebuilts.
   I was told that there will be an 009 clone made in China coming out soon.
