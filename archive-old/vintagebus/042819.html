Dear Bus Boys,

  I apologize for making the error of using your name instead of Bus Depot
on a post to the vintagebus list.  I have done lots of kingpin business
with you and your products and service are top notch.  I will be spend
more time in editing my posts before I send them so I get that right.

Best,
joe

&gt;   I used to order from Bus Boys, I don't anymore.  The owner Ron just
