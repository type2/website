Dunno if anyone's interested, but I've posted some swatches for the 
DUCO/DULUX colours available on VW's In Australia from 62-68, both local
produced and imports, there's a link outta the air-cooled menu option. from

http://www.type2_dot_com.au

These swatches are down sampled, but the original sheets were pro-scanned,
but it gives you the idea of what the names mean I guess and the years they
were used. I think that a few factory colours are not here, like Dove Blue,
but it may be that VW Australia called it something else, no doubt someone
will put me right.
