Subject: Blinkers

I am the guy that just bought a 56 Kombi.  Thanks for the responses on my 
headlights going out when letting out the clutch in first gear.  It turned 
out to be a worn out dimmer switch as list member(s) suggested.  Thanks for 
the help on that one, now another.

The PO converted to 12V.  Job not totally complete as I have had to replace 
Speedo lights etc.  Blinkers worked, but when used around town in succession, 
they eventually stopped.  Then, after an hour or so they would start working 
again.  Each time recovery time increased to day(s) and now no recovery and 
blinkers don't work.  My thoughts are that the 6V flasher was never changed.  
Do you guys agree?  Where is the flasher located in the bus?  Do I just buy a 
12V from a 67 and it plugs in?  Or do I need to buy another 6V and get one of 
those in line voltage reducers?  Thanks for your help in advance.
