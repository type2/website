You all live life on the wild side.  NONE of you said duct tape and bailing
wire.  Are you people crazy?  I NEVER leave home without the above mentioned

again Matt for the push :-)

What's in my parcel tray?

Map of Wisconsin
Map of Illinois
Map of Missouri
Spare keys to my office
A bag of incense the little pointy kind, various aromas.
some matches
a small plastic purse with my daughter's play makeup.
some small bungee cords I use for curtain tie-backs.
and when it rains, usually some water.
