Subject: Re: [VB] sun visors

  Sounds like you got a set of TMI repops with the bus. Do they look newish. I quit selling the TMI (bus) visors due to 
there inability to stay in place. Hopefully one day they will fix this problem. A little piece of velcro will help till you find 
some originals

&gt;Does anyone still have their sun visors installed?
&gt;
&gt;I just re-installed the ones that came with my '67 and they refuse to stay 
&gt;in one place, shifting as a corner, etc.
&gt;
&gt;I am no longer surprised that they were removed in the first place.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a fix for this?
