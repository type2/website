hello all,  i have a 1967 splittie and all of a sudden i cant find any
gears and when i do i am putting so much pressure into it that it
really scares me.  I am replacing my nosecone transmission mount, it
had a stripped bolt on one side, and was wondering if that was what
the problem was or if there is something more that needs to be
done?????  if there is anyone out there with helpful information i
would love to hear it.  Thanks for your time.   peace   mark, tampa FL
