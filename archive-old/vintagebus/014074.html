I should have been more specific about the tounge in cheek nature of that
remark. I was being a smartbutt.

I wrote 
&gt;I am worried that my '67 has those king
&gt; and link pin thingys that Muir said were dropped in '65:) Oh well......

cause Muir infers that all VWs post '65 should have ball joints. 

I still like the Idiot Guide even though I keep finding little errors.
Perhaps there outta be a FAQ file on them somewhere.
