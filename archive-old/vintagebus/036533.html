&lt;&lt; Could my problem be as simple (I use the term simple loosely)
to fix as adjusting the coupling, or should I be looking for a new
transmission? &gt;&gt;

&gt;From the description that there is 'no noise, no grinding, nothing'
when put into reverse leads me to believe that it is linkage related.
Pull the gearshifter out and take a look to see if the mechanism
is still in one piece.  Also, look at the plate under the shifter.  If
all look good then scan the archives (they still up and running?)
for info on how to adjust the shift lever position correctly.  If you
cannot locate the article just email me and I'll see if I can dig it
up for you.

Not that I don't want to sell another transaxle but I don't think the
problem lies in that direction.   If there was an internal problem
that was causing this then the gearbox should make some noise
with all the broken parts bouncing around inside.  Now that I have
said that......it might be that the bolt holding the reverse idler gear
arm onto the reverse shift rod has come loose.  Since the holder
for the gear arm has a slotted hole you could be actually engaging
reverse but the arm is not moving, therefore, no reverse, no noise,
no grinding, nothing.  To fix that problem would require the gearbox
to be removed from the vehicle and disassembled.

Have someone that knows what to look for lay under the Bus
(required safety plug here) with the engine off.  Try to put the
transaxle in reverse and see if the shift rod (the hockey stick)
coming out of the nosecone is moving as it should.  If so, then
you may have an internal problem.   But check the simple stuff
first!
