Hi,

Is there a campout going on the night before the show? I heard a bunch of
people camped behind the fairgrounds last time. I would like to get down
there the night before so I don't have to wake up so early to head down from
Vancouver and it would be cool to meet some list folk. Speak up if you are
camping out and give me a reason to head down.

Bob
