 I saw your post re: the gas tank strap material.  As for the roofing tar 
paper underneath the gas tank, what size of area are you talking about?  I'm 
assuming the small *square* area where the reserve tap threads on.  There is 
an area, maybe 6&quot; x 4&quot; (guessing from memory) where the tank protrudes down, 
that seems to seat down in a slightly depressed area of the same size on the 
body of the bus where the tank sits.  Is this correct?  I've never used 
roofing tar paper.  Is one side sticky, and that being the side that you 
stick down to the body of the bus, or stick onto the tank?  How many pieces 
(thickness) do you use?  I think you mentioned folding strips of paper.    
Thanks,    Robert &gt;&gt;

Hi Robert,
Tar paper can be used under the straps on the upper corners of the fuel tank. 
 Where we are talking about at the very least using tar paper is in the four 
areas near the hold down straps under the tank.  In these areas the tar paper 
keeps the steel tank from sitting directly on and rubbing on the steel of the 
VW bus body.  Which would cause rust and eventually holes!  As for the hole 
in the body that the bottom of the tank and it's outlet sticks through there 
should be a foam rubber seal to keep out the water and rust.  This is a good 
area to paint the body of the bus and the tank where this seal seats with tar 
to prevent more rust due to water spraying up from underneath.  This seal 
also helps to keep the engine cooler!
