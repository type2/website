May I make a suggestion here?

The ROUND tubing you get with the COSTCO shelter, what is the gauge size?
If it is fairly light, you may not want to bolt any roofing steel to it, in
a high wind, the extra strength of the roofing will twist the frame.

If all you are using is the framework from the shelter, $200 will buy you a
lot heavier guauge SQUARE tubing that with simple tools and a welder you
can have a much more sound structure.  Square tubing would be much easier
to screw roofing steel to and if you cut the legs a little long, it could
be sunk into the ground and concrete poured around for a much more
attractive approach.  You won't have all the stuff above the ground to walk
around.  Adding some angle braces to the frame would make it even more
stout.

For $400 you should have a really strong (yes you could even hang an engine
from it) and attractive shelter.  Paint the tubing to match the house (just
brush it on).

&lt;&lt; A while back there was a discussion
&gt;about a portable shelter sold by COSTCO.  I am currently looking at
&gt;purchasing one and wanted to know what others thought of them.   How well do
&gt;they hold up?  &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Mike,
&gt;A neighbor of ours had bought a shelter for his new pickup a few years ago.
&gt;About the same length as the Costco ones, but with coragated steel roofing,
&gt;and not as tall which might have been a problem with buses.  The price was
&gt;about $800.00.  The Costco ones we bought were about $200.00 with taxes
&gt;(170.00), and the material used to keep the weather off of what ever you put
&gt;under it is polystyrene.  Not a good thing to weld, or cut under due to
&gt;flammabilty of this material.  Also this material will probably start to fall
&gt;apart in a year or two.  So our plan is to buy corragated steel roofing at
&gt;that time and bolt it to the frame.  Making the total cost of the structure
&gt;about $400.00 which is still half of what our neighbor payed for a shorter
&gt;structure.
&gt;   As for anchoring the plastic feet provided with the kits are OK, but
&gt;plastic will brittlize and crack over the years of exposure.  We chose
&gt;instead to use building pier blocks with the steel brakets epoxied into the
&gt;top of them.  Then use short head studs and nuts to bolt the legs of the
&gt;structure to the pier block's brackets.  Lastly we drilled and bolted 1-1/2&quot;
&gt;diameter used steel water pipe to the legs horizontally and hung cinder
&gt;blocks of of these pipes to wiegh the structure down.  We still are
&gt;considering putting 55 gallon drums full of crushed aluminum cans roped to
&gt;the outside of the corners to help more with wieght, and to store our
&gt;accumilation of cans.  We get up to 80 MPH wnds through our way on ocassion,
&gt;and want to make sure the structure does not flail about against the VWs or
&gt;fly off to other properties around us.  Just a little while ago we drove past
&gt;a location that the structure had blown quite a way from where it had been
&gt;placed.   Eric&amp;Barb
