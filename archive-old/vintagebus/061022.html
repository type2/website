Subject: Single wheel Trailer Q's

Hello-

I just hooked up my allstate trailer and had a few
q's. It seems to hop around pretty bad some times. Not
just up and down but kind of side to side, on
straight-aways. My bumper feels a little loose but
that is all i can think of. Any ideas? Tire pressure
is all good and everything has been cleaned and
regreased to boot.
