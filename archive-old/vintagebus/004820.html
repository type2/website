Nothing against them as people, I lived there for 3 years in the AF, nice
place, but I hate to see our natural type 2 resources leave our shores. A
lot of nice busses and other volkswagens are gone forever and this has
caused a lot of resentment throughout the vw world here in the states since
the 80's. I personally wouldnt sell my vw if I knew it was going overseas.

&gt; Alright, I've been waiting all week to repost this.  (It was cancelled
near
&gt; the start of the week for Friday).
&gt;
&gt; I've been browsing this group as a new subscriber, and I hear a lot of
&gt; chatter about Japanese buyers.  Could someone provide me with a bit of the
&gt; background involved with this and also inform me of the current
controversy
&gt; which it is sparking?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Wes
