Yup.

I made a similar remark a while back and got flamed when someone posted 
they *needed* some accessory.  Your bus *needs* brakes, motor, transmission, 
etc.  

You *want* safaris, ambulance fans, NOS ribbed rear bumpers, ambulance
spotlights, trip speedo, dehne fuel guage, etc.

It's funny how man times someone &quot;wants&quot; an accessory for their bus, but 
the basic &quot;needs&quot; of the bus really aren't met, but that appears to be a
secondary consideration.  Like &quot;needing&quot; original safaris, but the bus
has no brakes.  Or floors.

I've also seen various individuals who &quot;need&quot; certain stuff 'cause they have a buyer lined up for it already.

I can go either way on the original glass issue.  Yeah, it's nice, but
it's sad when a project is stalled indefinitely for some inane little
part, all for a particular logo or something mundane.  If my '54 was
close enuf to being to done to worry about it, I wouldn't lose any sleep
over my non-original windshields.
