Subject: Taillights and flikker

Dear friends,
To follow up on the LED taillights, there are solidstate flikker &quot;relays&quot;
available in the Chinese electronic shops.
I am told, they are the units which the Chinese people fit in the VW (Passat)
cars, now made in cn.
( I do not know the american name for &quot;our&quot; Passat, sorry. )

On the 6 Volt Kombi, it is satisfying to see a regular 1 second on off - cycle
going for the flikkers.
i have put a little beeper under the speedo assembly to remind me to turn off
the flikkers, once I had gone &quot;round the bend&quot;.
