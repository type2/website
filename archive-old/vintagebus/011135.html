 &gt;Oval bug and bus are the same, Ghia are different. I have Hella repo's in
 &gt;clear and orange, I also have cheap repop's at a lot less cost.

 I took the thing apart...  NO parts numbers on it at all!  Not on the
 reflector, the gasket or the housing. Plastic lens reads
 HELLAK2718 ~ A2286 if that helps.

believe the bulb holder and lens are same bus/ oval bug, but the metal part 
is diferent- the drip holes or something.  Dunno about type 3.
