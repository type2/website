[...]yeah, that may be a difference, too. i've seen/own at least 3
different kinds of 59-61 housings. 
  i gathered from bob maglioti's reply he was talking of 62-71 style (amber
topped and all). sure would be cool to have euro-styled small glass
assemblies. (hmmmmm....thinking....how to make them.....)

&gt; Forgive me if I'm worng, but wouldn't the only difference in the
tailights for
&gt; a '59 bus, from the standard 59-61, that the light assembly is the screw
&gt; terminals versus the slip on terminals.  This is what I've been led to
believe.
