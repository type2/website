Subject: Re: [VB] Who has gas? I don't know, no gauge...

Hi Harmony,
Hmm, we have a 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  We do not need  no 
stinking fuel gauge!  ;-)
  That is what the reserve switch is for to get you the last 20-30  miles to 
the next gas station, especially in town.  Plus we keep both track  of last 
fuel fill up, and any maintenance in a log book.  That way we can  keep in mind 
that every 100-150 miles on a stock ten gallon pre-1968 tank  to fill up.  
Need more miles between fill ups?  You can install a 15  gallon 1968-71 bus tank 
and stretch the fill up stops to easily 150-200  miles.  Check out 
vintagebus_dot_com website for step by step info and images  on this upgrade.
  Invest in oil pressure and temp gauges, that are much more  important to 
your VW.
