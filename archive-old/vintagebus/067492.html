Subject: RE: [VB] broken clutch bolt

Old clutch pressure plate bolts are a pain in the petudy. Over the years I
have had many snap off. The main reason was that in the past they had been
over torqued and stretched, weakening them. Back in the early 70's I learned a
trick from an old VW mechanic. Since the clutch pressure plate bolt holes go
all the way through it is better to take off the flywheel and do you carbide
drilling from the back side and use a reverse easy out with the hole sprayed
liberally with LPS or WD-40. Carefully rock it back and forth and it will come
out. Since one broke all are suspect and I would buy another set. I get all my
hardened metric bolts and case savers at a local establishment called Tacoma
Screw. Maybe you have access to something like that where you are. Don't
forget your gland nut, if it's old, replace it!

Hi All,

While swapping clutches tonight, on tightning the final of the six
bolts, I snapped it off:(  My main reason for doing the swap in the
first place is to check the tranny in the non mobile 65.  Will that one
snapped off bolt cause havoc, even just driving it around the block a
few times?  If so, it seems I now need to swap flywheels also, or drill
out and re-tap the hole.  I had already broken my 3/4 ratchet, and bent
an angle iron breaker bar trying to remove flywheel from dead engine,
so I've got my work cut out for me either way.

Any experiences/advice on how to proceed?

TIA
Don J
