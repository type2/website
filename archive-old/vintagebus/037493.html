 Wow, you leave town for a few days and the mail really backs up!  I just
 returned to NC from Texas where I rescued a very straight 67 Westy shell
 from the boneyard.  It's the perfect match for my current 67 on which a tree
 fell.
 
 Anyone know where I can find a set of used rear drums and bearings?  They
 don't have to be any good, just something worn and cheap so I can get the
 shell rolling.
 ------
I have spare drums, ( which rear bearings are you talking about?) but do you 
really want to pay shipping from WA state, they are heavy)
..........
 Recently there was a thread about where to get 46mm sockets and 3/4 breaker
 bars.  I found &quot;Proto&quot; in the archives.  Anyone have a URL where you can
 order such things or know of any keywords I can search on?
 -----------------
I would go to a pawn shop, but then I am one of those cheep VW people.
....................
 Also, the shell I bought had safari's at one time.  Anyway to tell if the
 brackets are original or aftermarket?
 ---------------

if the windsheild glass is one, look at the top of the window area- the ledge 
hidden by the glass/seal at its top.  if they were original safaris it would 
have some nice painted round holes, through which you see a plate with 
threaded holes for the safaris frames to bolt to.   Aftermarket tend to be 
installed with holes and screws thread into the sheet metal of the bus.

look at the brackets welded to the window frame sof the bus- how are the 
welds?   Original have nice smooth welds around the brackets, and also latchs 
on the dash (or holes where they had been) and the one eyed duck on the nose 
to hold the wipers (or holes where it had been)

also- M codes M113 and 132 on the tag is hinged windsheilds (aka safaris) 
though you could have original safaris w/o it being on the tag.
