Subject: Re: Do overriders fit both styles of 64-67 bumper?

These overrider pieces are available as aftermarket repop items. The fit and
the guage of the metal might/might not differ from OEM. They seemed fine for
the price/quality/availability. NOS would be nice but not always available
or affordable to the average person. Tons of effort to straighten really
taco'ed over riders is not worth it to me. Most OEM bumpers have been
tweeked at least once. I used repop overrider uprights with OEM blades on
the RFH. &lt;WCM or Wolfb's West- I forget&gt; Had the bumpers &quot;straightened&quot; then
painted. I wished that I had dry fitted all of the pieces prior *checking
for proper fit* to having them painted. I would recommend doing this! Make
MINOR die-grinder or file adjustments to the profile of the overrider to
blade if necessary and then disassemble prior to applying the paint/pwdrcoat
finish. Keep in mind the thickness of the primer and paint or pwdrcoat. If
dead straight, I'd recommend going for the pwdrcoat over the paint.
Guaranteed, the bumpers will get a lot of abuse on the highways. 

My circumstances could easily be attributed to the inexact bumper blade profile.
