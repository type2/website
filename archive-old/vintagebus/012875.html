I know of sources for rockers and rear corners.
Does anyone know of replacement parts for bed floor and piece behind cab?
I can have them made locally at a cost of $1000.00 if I can't find them.
Thanks

Did you check out Das Bulli Haus in CT?  My understanding is they've got some
excellent metal parts for the bus.  Not sure about PUs, tho they may be able
to fashion what you need ...Thom's got their website address on his page..
