Cooling a Type2 is like cooling a tin shed. I've done some work on an idea
that cooling the entire interior is a waste of entropy-management when only
the occupants are uncomfortable. Wrap your hand around a big glass of iced
tea, feel cooler? I cobbled together a prototype a few years ago, but was
impractical for my short trips. Hope a dual system running for the Classic
weekend to use on the 200 mile trip down and show everyone at OCTO.

A note about that... There's a tall, Embassy Suite place near the official
hotel of the Classic and site of the Ed Economy Toy &amp; Literature show. We
enjoyed our stay there last year, close to all the action (and the
brewery/restaurant). Will find the number &amp; rates to post.
