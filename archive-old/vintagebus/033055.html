here is my situation,   i changed the oil in my 1600, dual port, doghouse 66

bus the other day,   it is a new brazilian case, less than 7000 miles.  2

days later it is leaking pretty bad , drip drip drip, i swear i only put in

a little over  2 quarts when i changed the oil.

i jumped right on it the next day, pulled the engine in 26 minutes, took off

the shroud, and the oil cooler looked pregnant, i happened to have another

one, brand new , both of them are brazilian oil coolers, so i put it on, put

it back together,reinstalled (3hours total time on gravel), and bam, it

worse than before,

now it is pouring out of the left side, so im thinking maybe the seals arent

did the second one balloon?    What weight oil are you using?   what size are 
you oil pressur relief springs.  I am wondering if this is because of too 
high oil pressure.  Never balooned a cooler myslef, but have heard of it 
happeneing when someone stretching the oil rssure springs to make higher 
pressure.  (oops, now its too much!!)   do you have a pressure guage you 
could use?
