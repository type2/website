Morning all

Thanks for the responses to the engine break in question. 
I have another. 
Monday right front wheel (drivers side here) started emitting smoke
while on the freeway. Pulled over and bled that wheels' brake first with
the hose disconned, then through the bleed nipple and drove off. Got
home and replaced all brake hoses and adjusted and bled the brakes. The
problem seems to have gone away.

My question is - what other than deffective brake hoses results in a
brake not returning (other than return springs as I've checked those) ?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Michael ('61 doublecab almost complete and looking damn fine)
