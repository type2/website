&gt;Yep, I saw those also. Demi's ride is a Ferarri Enzo, btw...

See, I had a feeling it was a Ferrari, but with those flip up doors I guess 
it was a Lambo...

&gt;Just saw Diamonds Are Forever last night (James Bond) which must have
&gt;come out in the late 60's. There are a lot of buses in the
&gt;background, especially in the airport scenes.

Is that the one where there's a red &amp; white deluxe following the taxi in a 
bunch of scenes?
