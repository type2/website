&gt;Well I guess I'm making progress on my lighting problems - I've got the
&gt;lil' bulbs in the front working and 1 brake light - but my passenger side
&gt;brake light doesn't work!  When the light switch is on all the lights work
&gt;until I step on the brakes - then the driver side brake light lights up
&gt;and the passenger side goes out - hmmmm.  

Go directly to the rear of your Bus.  Do not pass Fahrt, do not 
collect DM400,-.  Fix your taillight grounds and all will be well.

As built, the tail lights ground through the tabs that crimp the socket
to the reflector and the reflector mounting screws.  Some later model
taillights have a small copper bit riveted to the reflector that pushes
against the socket and may have a push-on tab for a ground wire.
If you have one of these, run a wire from this tab to ground, like
maybe to one of the tin screws or rear apron bolts.  If you don't have
the little push-on ground tab, either loop some solid wire around
the socket and twist it tight, then connect to that wire for grounding,
or use a small worm gear clamp to clamp a ground wire to the socket.
There are lots of ways, but just make sure your tail lights are
grounded.

Good luck!
