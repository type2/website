Interesting points...

I've followed the Great Race [literally and figuratively] for many years,
but I don't recall a Type 2 ever being entered.

The Race has started in Tacoma twice in recent years, and I've asked various
participants about a VW bus entry.  They've all agreed it would make an
excellent vehicle for the run but no one ever seems to enter one.

Of course, the first hurdle is the big buck entry fee.....

&gt;&gt;  They've been here before and I probably would have skipped it this time,
but
since there's a Heb in the race I'll go for sure.  &lt;&lt;

&gt;  And Bill Collins will be entered again in his Heb - the first and only VW
to have ever participated.  &lt;
