Okay, now that I've got your attention, I'm not trying to ruin my headliner. Instead, I was looking for a way to clean 34 years of whatever the heck that stuff is that gets on headliners.

I don't know what possessed me, but I tried bleach. 

1. A little sprayed on a damp cloth; wipe vigorously onto headliner panel...concentrating on trouble spots.

2. Rinse rag with water. Vigorously wash panel again. The intent here was to get all the bleach off...along with the grime/smoke/dust/dirt.

3. Rinse rag and repeat # 2.

4. Admire your clean headliner.

I don't know anything about the long-term effects, but I do know that the cleaned headliner is VERY close to the non-faded part under my now crumbled rear door arm covers. I'm not suggesting this is the solution you should try. I did it last night and it seems to work. That's all I know. Don't sue me or flame me or try this on your Toyota.

A side-note: I noticed that the rubber &quot;cord&quot; (for lack of a better term) that's used to hold the headliner on the sides of the roof is ivory in color up until it gets to the part that goes under the headliner in the back; then it is basically como green--on both sides. Weird. I can't imagine that como-green paint was sprayed on this. I don't know how this is, but it *is.*
Maybe the whole &quot;cord&quot; was como green and faded over time???

Another side-note: Some panels have holes for dots; some have dots for dots...like the material on the walls. You have to look very carefully to distinguish the difference. I remember riding in my mom's beetle as a child marveling at the dots...and the illusion of depth they could present. I'm sure I fell asleep many times, looking deep into those dots, probably wondering if they were dots or holes.

Thanks! Joe
