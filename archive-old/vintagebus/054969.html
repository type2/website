Subject: RE: [VB] Backup lights on 67 deluxe

Up until '67, back up light could be ordered as an
option.

&gt; There were some early '67s that did not have backup

&gt; changes when they needed to.  I almost bought a 67
&gt; Kombi (I think it was a September or October one)
&gt; that
&gt; did not have back up lights.  It was all original,
&gt; and
&gt; the corners were in very good, unrestored condition.
&gt; 
&gt; This was either a dealer add-on or a customer &quot;hack&quot;
&gt; to bring the bus up to safety standards.
&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, I've seen a '66 with the correct later lights
&gt; that the owner claimed we original.  The lights may
&gt; have been original, but they most likely didn't come
&gt; on that bus originally.  
&gt; 
&gt; All this applies to US-destined buses.  I have no
&gt; idea
&gt; about other contries.

&gt; &gt; I thought all '67s had rectangular BU lights above

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you have the normal ones for a '67?  Any one
&gt; know
&gt; &gt; if VW was consistent on
&gt; &gt; this?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Remember, I am new to this stuff:
&gt; &gt; I have been watching close at backup light
&gt; &gt; configurations, and I have not
&gt; &gt; seen this on anyone's yet. Is this a special
&gt; setup,
&gt; &gt; or am I just not finding
&gt; &gt; anything similar.
&gt; &gt; I have this one in good condition, the other is
&gt; &gt; busted. I have replacement
&gt; &gt; brake lights, but the white backup light, is it
&gt; &gt; unusual or just not used
&gt; &gt; anymore?
