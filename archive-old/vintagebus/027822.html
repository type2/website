Does anyone have recent experience with Wolfsburg West reproduction rear
bumpers? I'm trying to assemble a straight setup from a variety of NOS and
original parts. The blade itself has a flat spot that defied the best
efforts of Victory bumper a few years ago.

Or, better yet, can anyone recommend a bumper shop that won't be fuddled by
a VW bus bumper?
