Hey y'all
I was away for a couple weeks and had only weekends to play.  You might
recall that I was on the way home 2 weekends ago and my clutch arm
decided to go on a permanent vacation.  So last Friday Alex &amp; I pulled
the engine, surveyed the damage, and did the parts order.  The clutch
arm lever from RMMW is dookie, don't buy theirs.  The arm's ok, but I
had to make a spacer bushing because the arm wasn't machined for the
circlip close to the left bushing.  $1.70 worth of bronze bushing stock,
my trusty tubing cutter and sandpaper.  While the engine was out,
retorqued the heads, set valves, tried (again) to reseal the alternator
stand (slight leak).  Checked transaxle fluid, replaced what little
rubber fuel line I allow, replaced fuel filter, new plugs.  Checked oil
cooler lines, peered into the air filter and promised to clean it real
soon because the air scoops seem to suck more dust than the louvers.

My neighbor came over and asked if I'd take a look at his bug 'cause it
don't run all that good.  Timed it by ear he said, all proud of
himself.  Told him to buy the tuneup parts and we'll tackle it next
weekend.  While he was here I made him help install the engine.  Seemed
only fair since his wife likes to listen to disco at 2 am and I get up
at 5.

Tinkertoy shifts real nice, no valve clatter, smoooooooth.

Thanks to Todd and Eric&amp;Barb for their answers to the input shaft play
question.

Anyone wanna but a 70 Cadillac Eldorado with a 500 cc BMW engine?  Real
good mileage and will almost keep up with all the 36 hp 69 camaro's out
there ;-)

Dave
