Subject: Re: Balancing Tires.......

&gt;Canvassed the tire shops and VW dealers to try and balance my new
&gt;tires/bus rims ........... and nobody can do it.

A quick trawl through the archives reveals:

- Some chain shops have the adapter, but you might have to ask the
   manager or someone who's worked there a long time.

- Normal tire shops may have a conical adapter (used for dual wheels?)
   that an experienced tire man may be able to use on a Bus rim.

- Shops that do big truck (tractor-trailer?) tires may have the adapter
   or be able to balance them on the car.  (If balanced on the car, it
   may help to mark the wheels and drums so that you can get the wheels
   back on in the same position they came off.)

- If using a drum as an adapter, get the drum balanced by itself first.

&gt;The tire shop that restored my rims and balanced the tires before just
&gt;did this 1.5 yrs/6000 miles ago tried.......... 2 out of 3 rims are now
&gt;&quot;bent&quot; according to them ......and I beg to differ

I have heard, but cannot confirm, that the wide-five wheels were more
prone to damage than the later style wheels.  If the rims are really
badly bent, you should feel it while driving.  You might be able to use
a straightedge to check for less severe bending.  I have put (non-VW)
rims (no tires) flat on a reasonably flat concrete floor and tried to
rock them around to check for bending; you can also roll the bare rim
along the floor and see if it rolls straight.

I've seen a version of this somewhere, but I can't find it at the moment:
jack up the Bus, put a pencil on top of a box so it is close to and/or
just touches the rim, and spin the rim by hand - see if the rim gets
closer to the pencil and/or the pencil stops making marks on the rim.
