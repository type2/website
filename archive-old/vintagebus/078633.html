Subject: Re: [VB] oil consumption

 Just a general question/comment on newer cars: I went with my friend to drop
 off a newer Audi for it's 50,000 maintenance check. I think it is a 2001 or
 something like that. Anyway she was telling me that she was supposed to top
 the oil off on the thing, i.e. add a quart of synthetic or something. And I
 was saying-&quot;there's no way a car this new should need more oil, unless
 something is wrong with it. Basically a car this new should not be leaking
 oil-so if it is low, it must be burning oil, which indicates a problem to me.&quot;
 
 Anyway we get to the dealer, and I ask the guy behind the counter about it,
 and he says-the engine can burn a quart per 1000 miles and still be within
 spec, he then went on to say it had something to do with fuel efficiency etc. 
 
 I don't buy it.  How could you possibly engineer an automobile, that would
 burn a quart of oil per 1000 miles and still be within spec. My VW's don't
 burn that much oil, and they get better mileage that this new Audi.
 
 Anyone else ever heard this?

Yes, that is also the spec for new Mercedes. 1 qt per 1000 miles. Less miles per qt 
and you have excessive consumption. And this is on alloy blocks and pistons that have 
less than .0006&quot; piston clearance. (the block and pistons are made of the same material, 
so the expansion rate is the same. the pistons actually ride on silicon nodules, not bare 
alloy. oil consumption is thru the valve guides)

Back in the 40's and 50's, 1 qt per 300 miles was the norm!
