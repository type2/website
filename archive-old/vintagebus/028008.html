&gt;After years and years of being in the VW scene I feel
&gt;that I have been priced right out of the market. When
&gt;comparing the effort required in correcting (or
&gt;restoring) and maintaining the mechanicals of a basic
&gt;aircooled to be used as a dependable daily driver
&gt;against the costs in time and money *for my* current
&gt;needs- I feel that the &quot;value&quot; is not there *for me*
&gt;any longer.
&gt;JE

This, for me, is the nub of all these 40k buses... soon, if you CAN'T
afford to run in those circles, your bus WILL NOT be of use to you.
Sadly, I will NOT be able to run mine whan a fuel pump is $100 when
available, or P&amp;Cs of any quality are $500.

I could care less if your ride is stock or custom (tho customs usually
remind me of the Pacer my neighbor covered in shag carpet in the 70s. On
the outside).


DOWN with ALL nice buses, I say! Y'all are ruinin' it for us cheap bastards :)
