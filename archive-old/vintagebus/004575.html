&gt;&gt;seems like I saw a hinge pin remover a while back in one of the big name vw 
rags. specifically for removing vw hinge pins. kind of a c shaped deal with a 
hole to fit over the head of the pin and an allen head bolt to push the pin 
out. any one else seen one, or know where they can be found? I've been 
wanting one myself.&lt;&lt;

Why not take your bus to a good fabricator, welder, machinist and have a puller made. It should be simple.
