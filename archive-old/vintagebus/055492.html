&gt; In the FSV's we used an extended double pump.  It was driven off cam just
&gt; like stock, but was longer and had the pressure portion and a scavenge
&gt; portion.  The gears were longer on the scavenge side to keep ahead of the
&gt; pressure side.  The pressure side was adjustable to maintain 8olbs pressure
&gt; at 8,000rpm.  We carried an 8 qt tank for storage of the oil.  Baffles were
&gt; placed in tank to prevent foaming of the oil at return to engine.  We used
&gt; stock pickup tube in engine block for scavenging.

So the pump was something like the autostick beetle pump, with two pumping
chambers separated by a sealed partition?

Interesting idea, but it doesn't seem to be applicable to buses.  We just
don't have enough cornering forces to cause oiling problems.

It would be nice to put the oil filter on the scavenge side, since this
would not result in a pressure drop to the bearings.  Is this common
practice in dry-sump engines?
