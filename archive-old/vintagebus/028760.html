If you have 23 window Deluxe fever, you're sunk already. You'd better
know how much you can afford to spend and set that as a limit before you
even look.

It looks to me like you can get all the seats if you're willing to pay
the PRICE. You probably should try to get them while you're getting the
bus. That way you can bring them back east with you instead of having to
ship them.

Nothing on a bus is all that hard to fix, that's one of the reasons I
drive a bus.

Reasonable price? See paragraph one above. If you find a bus you like
for a price you can afford, buy it. Try not to let the fever get the
best of you.

That's my $.02. Not too helpful, I guess, but then if I wanted to be
helpfull, I'd tell you to put your money in an IRA. 8^)

Where are you, anyway?

&gt; Well, here I am, once again, to seek out the advice of all the Bus gurus and
&gt; enthusiasts.  I have gotten a case of Bus Fever.
