I use a Miller 300 TIG 1700.00 dollars 10 years ago without radiator, torch
or pedal, there are smaller Tigs out there now that are fantastic for a fair
price, but don't try to weld aluminum with them.

For my MIG I now use a Hobart 250, this was before Miller bought them out,
this is an industrial welder with a very high DUTY CYCLE. Before the Hobart
I wore out a Lincoln (took ten years) still worked but I was starting to
loose my DUTY CYCLE.

Why do I talk about my machines and DUTY CYCLE, well after 20 years of
Rustoration work I have learned what works and last. The main thing in a
welder is DUTY CYCLE, the reason being is that when welding the duty cycle
is what keeps the welds consistent as the machine works harder, basically if
you are running 100 amps or X amount of volts you are using a percentage of
the duty cycle, the higher the duty cycle the more consistent the welds will
be, there is nothing worse then welding then all of a sudden you notice your
welds getting worse and worse, this means your at the max of the duty cycle
of the machine. That's why I choose the Hobart, high duty cycle to amperage
ratio. 

There are a lot of Mini 110 and 220 Mig welders out there, I would go to a
professional welding supply store, there are ton's in Cali, in Santa Ana,
Cal there are 5 welding supply stores within walking distance of each other,
you can walk in, ask questions and the best thing of all is that they let
you try them out on the spot, you can get the feel, etc. etc., plus when you
purchase the machine they can set you up with wire (I use .023 no#6)and
75/25 argon CO2 mix, then you can try on all the cool insta change welding
helmets, different kinds of gloves, get your self some welding chaps, a
couple cans of splatter guard, spray this on the surrounding metal when
welding and you won't get a bunch of welding zits around your welds,buy some
welding clamps, spot weld drills, cut off wheels, grinding disc, some zinc
spray and all the other goodies you'll need to do a bus. People think these
stores are expensive, you'll be surprised, not much more then the Depot's,
better quality products, most of the time knowledgeable staff. Remember
these stores are for the pro's in general, no different then your automotive
paint suppliers.

Ahhh....just so you know, there is a big difference between MIG and TIG
especially in price.  A quality MIG (metal inert gas) welder from Linclon or
Miller will run you around 600 bucks +.  I like my Miller XP130.  It has
metal guide rollers that most of the cheaper brands don't.  It's never let
me down or jammed once.  

Yes I'd love to have a TIG too, but those run about 1500 and  take a bit
more skill to run.  Nothing too hard but still takes more practice than
zapping a mig bead.  Still though the quality of a TIG weld is far superior
plus the benefit of far less heat buildup and excess weld to grind.  

Stick with the quality machines...stay away from the 299 POS's.



Steve

Lincoln or Miller are the best inexpensive brands.  Get MIG/TIG
