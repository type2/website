Thom,
It took me a while, but if finally got the picture.  Now that's an IDEA!  I'd
have to run with my gates dropped, but hmm...

I wonder what the weight load would be on the rear and what you you have to do
to make up a reasonable mount for the kingpin.

Got a barndoor you want to lend to the project?
