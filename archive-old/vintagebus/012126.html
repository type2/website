Ok Heres the deal. I got another motor for cheap $$$ and I want to fix it
and use it for a spare... The problme with it is that the Gland Nut (as
usual... second time I found this) was not tightened enough and it backed
out.. Letting the flywheel flop around and ovaling out the insert holes
for the flywheel dowels on the crankshaft... SO I cleaned up the end of
the crankshaft....

Heres my question as I do not want to buy a new crank shaft.... 

Can I use some JB Weld and reinsert the dowels in the holes and let it
dry?... They have a little bit of play but not alot.... Or should I take
it to a machine shop and have the holes redrilled?... and if I do that
does the flywheel have to be aligned a certain way?...SO that the teeth
align to the starter motor?... And What can I use to clean the gook off
that is on the Flywheel and Clutchplate as I know U shouldn't get even a
finger print of grease on em...?

Greg
