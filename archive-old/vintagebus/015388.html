Hello Listees,

A couple of quick questions for y'all:

First off, how does one remove the key cylinder from the ignition switch?  
Ive pulled mine off, and looked all over for little screws to loosen, but I 
can't find any.  I need to find out the code so I can get a key made.

Second, There was a thread a bit back on sheet metal, and it was concluded, 
I believe, that WW battery trays are not a good fit.  Who has ones that ARE 
a good fit?  Is Schofield okay?  If this was already answered, pmail me so I 
don't start that thread over again.

Third, anybody got a rear apron for a '64 bus somewhere near SLC they would 
sell me?  I think that anything 65 and later doesn't work with my lid, but 
I'm not sure.  What years would work?  I am not objected to putting a later 
engine lid and rear apron on if someone has both for sale :-)

Thanks!

Mike Anderson (obviously not vintage nazi)
