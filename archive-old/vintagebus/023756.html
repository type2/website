Subject: Q: Type 4 Oil Cooler

First, let me say thanks to Chris (CCanter) for supplying me with _real_
crimp connects, including the big voltage regulator connector. I expect
these will work much better than the aluminum connects I've been able to
find locally.

What do y'all think about putting a Type 4 cooler in a dog house engine
for a Type 2? I've been considering this for a couple years, since I
built my first Type 4 bus engine. Bob Hoover's statement about the
doghouse cooler being good to 2000cc (I think that's right) made me bag
it in favor of engine balancing and paying attention to compression
ratio. Now the VW Trends article and a list question have raised my
curiosity. Has anybody on the list tried this? 

BTW: I didn't find the VWTrends writeup to be particularly enlightening,
but the author, Hank Roed, documented the procedure well.

Thanks for your time,
pd

PS. this is the third evening I've tried to send this, let's see if
Legacy Comm can keep their mailserver running one evening this week!
