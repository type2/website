Help!

MY oil pressure light(the one that is supposed to be green on the earlier
buses) came on intermittently on my bus a couple weeks ago. So I checked Muir.
According to him, the oil pressure relief valve was probably dirty, and needed
to be clened. So I took it oput, and cleaned it up, although it didn't seem
that dirty at all. Muir thought that the parts would probably be stuck in the
opening. But it wasn't, it just popped right out. Anyway I put it back
together, and the light didn't come on anymore.

Then today, I was driving around and the light started to blink. So I drove
home tenderly, and when I got home I checked the oil. the dipstick seemed a
bit hotter than usual, and the oil was down to the lower mark. I opened the
oil filler cap to add some more oil, and it was smoking, but it didn't smell
like anything was burning. I added some oil, then checked under the bus and
saw a lot of oil coming out the right side, near the valve cover, I couldn't
wuite tell if it was coming out at the valve cover or not, and the engine was
too hot for me to crawl under.

I am at school now, but will be returning to the bus shortly. Any ideas on
what to do? What to Check?

Somewhat related note:I just had the transmission fluid replaced, and the gear
oil. As well as the brakes adjusted. I don't think this should have affected
anything but just FYI. I also changed the oil when cleaning the oil pressure
relief valve, and cleneed the oil pressure sensor.
