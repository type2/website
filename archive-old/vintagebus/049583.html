Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?

Don't have a garage...
have a small warehouse and a long lean-to shed, tho :)
They contain a 65 Pickup in a sad state of deshabile, a 1950 Ch*vy 1/2 ton
with the bed off and being rebuilt, most of my neighbors old recording
studio, 40 or so tires and/or rims offa hot rod bugs, 30 engine cases of
various years, some trannies and an 8 x 12 room stacked to the 12' ceiling
w/ vw parts.
Not to mention a pile of  tin, the welder, the compressor, my old cruiser
bike, a cat, some mice and right now my budy Lewis, madly building 3
engines at once!

Recent addition was a PILE of CRAP that a machinist friend who moved to LA
last week is &quot;temporarily' stashing here till he gets set up. He took all
the fun tools with him, but there's GOTTA be something I can do with the 6'
military-issue borescope he left ;)

My girlfriend no longer likes coming over - says it reminds her too much of
Sanford and Son. So I whip out my LaWanda Page (Aunt Esther) and Redd Foxx
LPs to make it complete!
