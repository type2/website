well i am keeping busy on the bus these days...Last week I was tryingt to
empty out my water tank, which i try to do every now and then to prevent
anything bizarre happenign in the water. Anyway instead of taking off just the
cap on the bottom of the tube sticking out of the tank, i took off the tube,
then my bis proceeded to flood, with about 3 gallons of water. I then began to
frantically take stuiff out of the bus, my ice box/cabinets...tried to dry up
as much as possible.

There was so much under the vinyl flooring, i decided once i returned from dc
to boston, i took everything out but the z bed, theose screws are really in
there. I am now looing at an almost empty bus. I am planning on putting in a
new floor, maybe some new cabinet work, but it depends on whether i can get
access to a wood shop. Otherwise it will have to wait until i get to houston.

i will try to keep you posted on the re-building of this thing.
