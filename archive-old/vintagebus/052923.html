I picked up 30' for .89/foot at the FLAPS. It's about 1&quot; wide, grey. You =
can get black and white if you look for it. This is the stuff you see on =
firewalls of 'merican cars packed around wires or in holes, usually =
covered with paint. Feels like glazing putty. Fills the gap between the =
body and window and seams like it'll work! Will report further if we get =
anymore rain this winter.=20

Here's a link to a much cheaper source, .16/ft.,  http://www.drclassic_dot_com/=
cgi-bin/database/database.cgi?action=3Dshow&amp;c=3DCar_Care&amp;a=3DW00009  I've =
never dealt with them, just a quick search result.=20
