Subject: Tach installation
X-Incognito-SN: 393
X-Incognito-Format: VERSION=2.01a ENCRYPTED=NO

A few years ago I started to restore my '65 microbus. A house building and 
relocation interupted the project. 
I've lost the installation instructions for a VDO tach I bought many years 
ago. Can anyone help?
