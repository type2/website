---- snip ----
I found out that my Bus was only insured for ACV - $500 deductible today.
It is smart to look over the insurance papers!!
Phone Conversation went like this:
I asked &quot;well, if it was totalled, what would it be worth?
Insurance Agent replies: ACV is $2,400 new in 67' minus 33 years
depreciation minus $500 deductible is AHEM
[long pause]
 Sir, we would call it a wash and refund your premium.
---- end snip ----

I just went thru the same drill recently with my '67, and I have seen this
same thread come up on the Ghia list (which made me go looking) as well.

In the end I moved all my cars to Nationwide which will cover the ACV based
upon an appraisal that is kept on file with the agent.  I pay for full
coverage based upon the appraised value, and there are _NO RESTRICTIONS_ as
to when/where I can drive it.  It took me two days to make sure I was
covered at a level I wanted (even the underwriters were not certain and I
went thru 3 layers of supervision to get the final clarification; in writing
to boot!!)

I mention the restrictions here, as that became a sticky issue for me.  I
drive my bus to work daily (5 miles of secondary roads) and on occasional
errands to the grocery store, etc.  This has equated to around 3000 miles
since I brought the bus into service last October; not near the numbers some
of you guys out there roll up, but pretty cose to average for a 'second car
to putt around town in' vehicle.
When I went to two other mainstream insurance agencies (GEICO and USAA; good
companies that have insured me for almost 20 years), they would only talk to
me if I would live up to a littany of restrictions which included:
--Keeping it in a locked garage at all times (I guess they were afraid it
would try to run away from home)
--All drivers would have to had their license 10+ years (no biggie, but a
PITA)
--Can not drive it to work or local errands (the real  _'show stopper'_);
only to car shows
--2K miles per year max
--Annual appraisal on file (a good thing to do but again a PITA)

Moral:  you CAN get insurance for the full value, but watch the
restrictions; they will nickel and dime you to the point where they may not
pay when you need it.
