well here we go again, vwhoward and i and the families!!!!!
are on a journey to prescott valley for the famous 4th of july bus-in at
mark chambers house, massive water ballon fights city wide and americas
oldest rodeo, round up them
buses and have a hoot. sorry to leave the 119 degree temp of havasu, but we
thought we'd give it a break for the cool weather of prescott 95 day and 75
evening, i'll probaly
need a jacket and a heater in the bus, been cruising in
this temp since the classic and no overheating, must be the double doors
airflow to the cooling vents i guess or the lack of flaps? o well only time
will tell only have 3000 on the new factory 1600 must not be broke, i mean
broken in yet, you-all have a nice 4th and we'll be talking back at you come
monday evening (semi trucker talk due to cb's in our buses)
