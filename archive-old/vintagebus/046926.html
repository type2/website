Hi Andre,
Engine area in the engine compartment, or in the cargo area near the engine 
bay?

&lt;&lt;Was that an accessory heater or something else? Did they install gas 
heaters in
 campers? &gt;&gt;
If it is electric it sounds like a DPO modification or at best a aftermarket 
one.  Yes, there were at least two gas heater manufactures.  Eberspacher, and 
South Wind by Stewart &amp; Warner.
