&lt;&lt; anybody know the difference between asphalt/petroleum fiber/non-fiber 
tar/coating/sealant roofing products and the &quot;plastic &quot; varieties ? &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
Yes we do!  Tar totally repels rust, plastic sealers and undercoating 
products once rust gets under them acts like a greenhouse for the rust to run 
wild!

&lt;&gt;
For the above reason again, and the fact that tar will reseal once it is 
reheated.  Anything else will just keep on leaking.  We tried grease, 
silicon, and many other sealants only to have them fail in six months or 
less.  Also tried 3M body sealant which was a real pain due to being like 
really thick/sticky peanut butter, but that started leaking two years later.
