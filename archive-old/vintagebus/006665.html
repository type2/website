Yes but read the lines, The ad did get your attention and I have allready
been offered the parts I need to repair and complete it off the ad. The bus
isn't for sale. Now the 59 single cab in the ad is, I need the money from it
to help me get going on the BD. The high price would scare anyone away after
looking at the pictures. So if you need parts put Barndoor for sale and
everyone reads the ad. I have been offered the following parts so far.
Steering wheel, sunroof header, doglegs, rear valance, cargo doors, so in 1
ad I have found the parts I need to complete this bus, still need tailights
and rear bumper.

ronnie

ps, I am going to try to start the engine this weekend and see if the trans
works.

pss. I could slam it and turn it to a real Cal Looker, or part it out,

Wait didn't he just get that bus? And wasn't he losing sleep cause it wasn't

at his shop when it was supposed to be. It is sad to see someone give up
hope 
on a project, but to go ahead and try to sell it only after owning it a 
couple of days is incredible. Ronnies bus was told to of cost him 1,500.00, 
and transport cost prolly no more that a 1,000.00, so where does that extra 
5,000.00 of bus come from. It looks like it would be a 1500.00 project, not
a 
7500.00 project. Might as well put it on ebay? This is what I dont 
understand, is that bus that valuable, looks like the BD that got cut up in 
PA..
