Subject: Latest update on the 40 IDF Situation
Date: Sat, 29 Jul 2000 18:59:31 -0500

Today I went to Lincoln in the 67 bus and stopped by Speedway motors and
grabbed a Holley fuel pressure regulator #12-804 for $21.99.  Then I ran
over to Frank Musil's house and grabbed the Berg ball seat conversion for my
40IDFs.  Had a nice visit with Frank as usual.  If anyone is interested in
buying a valve guide reamer, Frank has some for sale for a good price.  Just
email him at aircooled_at_alltel_dot_net and ask for one and he'll set you up.
Next off I went to Best Buy and spelunkered down about $80 for set of
surface mount pioneer speakers (TSX200 or something similar to that) which
work absolutely wonderful mounted upside down underneath the parcel tray.  I
haven't installed them yet but I measured and they will fit the dead space
just perfectly.  The are 3 ways and sounded better to me than the Jensen 2
ways which were located near by on the speaker test wall.  Once that was
done I headed for home.  Saw a nice black oval beetle with roof rack heading
south on 33rd street and tried to follow him but missed the turn.  It was a
really nice looking beetle - scooting along really quick too.  Got a nice
wave from a guy in a chocolate brown late model T4 bus but never even saw a
new beetle the whole time.  These dubs sure are scarce out here.

After stopping at McDonald in Lincoln and then stopping at the lumber yard
here at home to see how everyone was getting along without me (all too well
it seems. :-)), I came home and started fitting pieces and parts.  I had to
go buy some 3/8&quot; NPT brass fittings for the better part of $4.00 at the
local FLAPS and after some precision fitting, drilling, and creating line
routing, I was able to fit the regulator underneath the center of the Berg
linkage, to the right of the coil, and just left of the fan backing plate.
I also installed the ball seats in the carbs so now I'm ready to test fire
the engine again.  I came in to cool off, clean up, have supper, and make
this post.  More later...
