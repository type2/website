  If you put the filter in the engine compartment you 
will have to run the lines through the tin or 
sheetmetal. This is the main reason I put my filter 
under the bus. The filter is vertical, easy to change 
and would be hidden by the rear bumper (if I ever locate 
one...hint,hint). I have not seen any evidence of damage 
by road debris (from So Cal to Maine, gravel or 
otherwise!). The only thing I'm not happy with is how 
close the lines run to the exhaust. I haven't figured a 
way around this though.
  Let me know if you want to see some pictures of my 
setup.

----------
Option two is &quot;somewhere&quot; under the bus.  The main gripe 
I have about this is
rocks and heat exchangers.  Sure I can shield the hose 
(this was discussed in
the archives) but I can avoid most of the problem 
entirely by putting the 
filter in the engine compartment.  Then there's rocks 
which might do bad 
things to the filter.  In the engine compartment, if a 
rod flies out of the
case it might get the filter, but then I have a little 
more to worry about :-)

I'm leaning towards putting it in the engine 
compartment, but I want to do
the best thing.  Does this seem reasonable?  If anybody 
has any suggestions
for better hose routing I'd love to hear it, what I'm 
planning seems fairly
safe but I've never done this before.
