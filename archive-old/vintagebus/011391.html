Sundial vs EZ vs VanBondo?

Nah, VanBondo's not versus anyone... He's just been really consistantly busy
and hoped to push the scans of the EZ Camper onto his own website~ once he
got a clue and hacked an URL. I spend 40-70 hrs per week sitting in front of
a CRT for my job so the last thing that I wanna do is sit in front of one
all freekin weekend.

I'm literally bustin boo-tay on my own '63 EZ Camper in real life trying to
get it on the road very soon. This weekend is the main push to the finish.
This bus will certainly poke holes into the notion that I only drive trophy
princesses. The wife is my only trophy princess and THAT is another story
all together. ;-)/ The bus is multicolored and is battered. The wife has
only one hue and is pampered.

In the face of Josh R (OK)'s attempted humiliation, I broke down and scanned
the brochure for the EZ Camper and forwarded them to good ol Josh.
Hopefully, he'll give me credit for the effort and stuff them into his
kewell URL. At least the scans will give us a chance to read politically
incorrect ad copy like &quot;Large man sized bed&quot; and &quot;Man Sized Wardrobe&quot;. (What
man can get into that wardrobe closet or wants to? Hank, the angry, drunken
dwarf?) Just to even things out a tad there is a picture of the &quot;little
lady&quot; doing that domestic subserviant grocery gittin' child rearing thang.
When Mom's at home with the kids and the Ding-Dongs, Dad can deal with that
&quot;Man sized&quot;  Betty Page wannabe in a ballistic brassier that looks like she
took a styling tip from the top of the tinman's head. 

^^ vs &lt;8I)  


Don't forget to notice the single cab parked on the street in the lower left
corner of the areial photo &lt;sp&gt;. Or is it a Chebby truck?
Seriously, I don't know if the scans will be the definitive clarifier of the
EZ/Sundial confusion. VanBondo still maintains that they are really really
similar.
Ultimately, who cares. Drive what ya got and be proud!
SWUN!
