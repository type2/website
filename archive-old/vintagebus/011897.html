Since we have been discussing generators I thought I would say something 
about generators themselves. I bought one from a local FLAPS many years 
ago. As with most places now days, it came with a lifetime warrantee. 
Good thing to. I have seen some that won't work off the shelf! The 
reason is that most are rebuilt by students learning how to work on 
electrical equipment. The parts can be mismatched, or wired incorrectly. 
So should I have sprang for a genuine Bosche rebuild? Nope. Heres 
why....
The lifetime warranty has followed me from bus to bus. I don't know if 
it should, but I do it anyway. Sometimes, I will take a old gen in for a 
new one, when I am ready to replace one, before I even remove the 
&quot;lifetime&quot; one. This makes things easier on me. Same for my starters. 
I don't even bother trying to replace brushes anymore, I just replace 
the whole unit. (Actually, I have had brushes prematurly wear, and some 
have had ridges in them so they wont push down on the commutator 
correctly after a short period, say 6 to 12 months, so I figure I 
deserve the replacement anyway)....

The only thing I do though, is I take my newly rebuilt part to an 
electric specialist who checks it for me, and does a true diagnostic for 
bad wiring. Then I am ready to install.

Just thought I would pass this along. Although in most of my life I buy 
local things, shop at local owned stores, etc. it is nice to know that I 
can go just about anywhere in the country with my bus and know that the 
part can be replaced for free if it fails.

Jason
