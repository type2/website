&lt;&lt; My drum is oversized?  How could that be?  It fits the wheel just fine and 
I've been using the same drum for over six years.  Granted, I did blow out a 
wheel cylinder on that wheel a few months back and am now riding a new 
cylinder along with new flexlines.  Do you mean the drum is worn to the point 
that the brakes have to travel that much farther to connect?&gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Yes!

&lt;&lt;How do I tell if the drum is the wrong size?  Or if it is worn out?  I am a 
novice and have never had a &quot;new&quot; brake drum to look at to tell obvious 
differences.  &gt;&gt;
Take two pieces of wood kind of like popsicle sticks but longer.  Put in the 
drum past the unworn edge the shoes do not ride in and slide the two pieces 
of wood until they touch each side.  Mark this length and remove out of the 
drum.  Align the two pieces of wood until your mark shows and measure.  If 
the drum is not worn out do this measuring for the inner and outer side of 
the drum inside diameter to see if there is any tilt or slope there.  If 
.030&quot; or more the drum needs to be turned.  VW drums do not have alot of 
material to remove so only turn them if they really need it!
 
&lt;&lt;Okay, I consulted Bentley and his term for the bar at issue is the 
&quot;connecting link.&quot;  It runs horizontally between the pads and is directly 
underneath the wheel cylinder.  Would worn brake drums cause this mechanism 
to be too loose and thus allowing it to come apart and jam itself against the 
cylinder?&gt;&gt;
  Yes, definitely!  Up to 1500 Lbs. per inch pressure occurs in VW braking 
systems!  No spring you can install by hand is going to keep this from 
pushing to far outward if the drum is worn out.

  &lt;&lt;It seems to boil down to the fact that I should just by ALL the brake 
parts for that wheel and start over from scratch.  I wanted to do this 
anyway, just not now.&gt;&gt;
Not quite!  Many of todays replacement parts are being made badly, especially 
brake drums!  You just need to go over the Bentley manuals and take carefull 
measurements and inspection of the parts.  Then if you really need a new part 
take time to ask around what is best or better yet stock up on enough part to 
do at least the axles/bearings/brakes on one side of your bus.   Eric&amp;Barb
