Subject: OCTO listy meeting time and place


 I should have the franinfrugley bus there, an easy bus to spot, just name a
time. Like ronnies' after the first raffle or something. It's always easier
to meet after a raffle as everybody is usually at the raffle and can wander
to the meeting spot after that.
