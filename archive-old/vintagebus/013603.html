hi...

   I have a question about my '64 singlecab doors..what doors are 
correct?the doors that came on the bus when I got it have push 
button handles and those catch latches from the door to jam(to 
hold the doors open)problem is there are no mounts on the body 
side for them...should it have '63 style pull out doors? or did they 
make doors with push button handles and no catch 
latches??should I just weld up the holes on the doors and call it 
good?or what?   I'm in the restoration process but I'm not a 
perfectionist.  this thing is going to get used and is being built with 
drivability in mind...everything mechanically has been rebuilt 
shifting,trans converted to IRS(late model 
bug)steering,1600sp,brakes(stock front, '65 type3 
rear)spindles.....slightly lowered(I could'nt help myself..no self 
control)everything body and interior wize is stock
