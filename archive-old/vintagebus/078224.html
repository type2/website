Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

jdd,

Instead of the oil in those tough to get at spots, go back with the POR.
It's far more practical, better for the job, and if they are tough spots,
do you want POR in there or oil?

&gt; Funny - I got lots of different responses to that question.  I think I'll
&gt; give the bar and chain oil a shot.  Every one who has actually done it
&gt; describes it as excellent.  I have por-15'd under most of my bus and it
&gt; looks very good - I just think that the bar and chain oil would be awesome
&gt; over any of those spots that were tough to get.  Bar and chain oil - is
&gt; chain saw oil that contains phosphoric acid.  I suspect it is very close to
&gt; the Rust Check stuff.
