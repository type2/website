Hmmm...

Instead of hauling a utility trailer behind ya, why not just tow a bug?  If
you break down, no probs, just hop in the bug and off to the FLAPS you
go.....;-)

You have got to be kidding me?????????????
To carry all that stuff, you must haul a utility trailer behind you
everywhere you go!
I can see some of that stuff, but honestly.......
I'm curious if there are any others that might carry even more stuff than
you!  Perhaps a spare steering column, or spare motor, front beam,
complete transaxle or front hood and bumper maybe.
later :)
