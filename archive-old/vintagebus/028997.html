aaron...

    matt r. already suggested graphite or chalk.... talcum powder would work too
(isn't that chalk in a sense? how is talc made?...?)... as long as it's not soylent
green, i'm happy.
    anyways.... talc is a handy thing to have. you will use it again to dust the
rubber bushings for your spring plates, someday if not already. some friends of mine
made a chalk outline of a body in front of the apartment when they knew i was coming
back from a backpacking trip.... nice surprise, replete with crime scene tape,
etc... many uses has talc.
    i was thinking somewhere along the lines of &quot;prussian blue&quot; or &quot;machinist's
layout fluid&quot;.... some of that blue stuff. the interference will rub the metal down
and there will be a clear spot where the snag is.
    for that matter, you *could* use magic marker...
    but i do think it is hard to check the fit between splined pieces... some
incidental wear of whatever detecting medium you use will happen just by r &amp; r'ing
the drum....
    glad you got one drum to fit...

&gt; eyeballing the axle splines and drum splines and seeing where the
&gt; &gt; interference is.
&gt;
&gt; I'm attempting this, but it's basically impossible to tell where it is
&gt; hanging up. Any suggestions on how to tell what is catching?
