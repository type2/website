Subject: Oil strainers-Magnetized?

I need to stock up on these, and hear (like all damn parts now) there
are ones to avoid with larger screen mesh...How has these in the correct
mesh then?
I need the larger style (interior top hole) one, I think the 175B, gotta
rip it out to check, but I have tons of the smaller ones, no larger.
Seems that they all have squished mesh, the kind I need. Will have part
no to buy the right ones, just want to know where they are.

Has anyone experimented with magnetic screens?

Al
