Subject: re: Clutch pedal doesn't return

Hiya Tom
You looked at the rear part of the system but what about the front?  I 
would check the attachment point where cable meets pedal.  Lubricate the 
pivot really good.  Are the cable boots in place?  Do they show signs of 
tearing, water intrusion, lubricant leaking out?  If there is a spring 
at the pedal is that in place and functioning properly?  I assume from 
your post that this is not temperature dependent so thickening grease 
probably isn't the culprit.  Other than what I suggested it looks like 
you've done the external checks that you can.  On the Tinkertoy I once 
had a similar problem and it turned out that the throwout bearing had 
broken it's mounting spring and so shifting became increasingly 
difficult task until I had to speed shift the last few miles and start 
out on the starter at stop signs/lights.  A few hours on a Saturday 
afternoon and a throwout bearing and springs fixed it.
