Subject: wiper motor question

For the two-speed, self-parking wiper motor, what is the mechanism that
causes the motor to self park?   My 67 just failed state inspection
because the motor parks the wiper in the middle of the windshield.  This
hadn't been a problem to me, because I had found that if I turn off the
switch at just the right time, the wiper will park to the side, but the
state inspector didn't know the trick, so my bus has a nice black reject
sticker until I can fix it.

Just in time for a weekend project 8^)

Thanks for suggestions,
Russell
