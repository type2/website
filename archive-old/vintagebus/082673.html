Subject: Re: univeral grease?

&gt;the bentley says to lubricate accel. &amp; heater cables with &quot;univeral
&gt;grease&quot;... What the heck is that and what kinda of look will my local
&gt;FLAPS employee give me when I ask for that?

Page S-2 3 of your '63-'67 Bentley has a little translation chart.
&quot;Universal grease&quot; in VW means &quot;High pressure grease&quot; in English.  It
seems to be used mostly on the body and in the fuel pump and the
transmission input shaft bearing.  The main other kind of grease that
is specified is &quot;Lithium grease&quot; (VW) or &quot;Multi-purpose grease&quot;
(English), which mainly goes in the wheel bearings and front axle.

If you flip forward a few pages to S-2 7 and 8, you get the complete VW
specs for both Universal and Lithium greases.  If you really want to
confuse the FLAPS person, quote these to him.  I looked at a few specs
for Sta-Lube grease online, but the set of specs they quote and the set
of specs VW quotes do not intersect.  mm WS is a measurement of pressure
(like psi), so I'm not sure how that relates to &quot;consistency&quot;...  It
might be interesting to pick your three favorite grease vendors and
email the VW specs to their technical department and ask which one of
their products they would recommend.

The short answer is: I would be tempted to use regular &quot;high temperature
disc brake wheel bearing grease&quot; for both Universal and Lithium greases,
but that has something to do with the fact that I have a couple of cans
of it kicking around the garage.
