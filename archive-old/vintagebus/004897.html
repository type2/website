As posted about a week ago or, there is a guy in Phoenix who makes towbars
for buses.  Well I ordered one as I'm going to be able to put it to great
use before long.  His price is $150 and when I asked about shipping, he said
that is the total price.  $150 delivered!

We had a nice chat on the phone and came away feeling like I had just dealt
with a real fine fella.  He's a little hard to get in touch with but I
called him 4 times and he returned my calls all 4 times - I just happened to
not be around.  With a determination like that, he's gotta be good.  He was
thrilled when I told him about the internet connection and all - how his
towbars are discussed on here from time to time and that is how I located
him.  Here's the info should anyone want to order themselves a bus towbar:
