--part1_59.193b6834.29d3951b_boundary

I have a couple of sets of lights that I am trying not to tear down.  The 
question is one of them is a plug in light bulb type I believe its a 12 volt 
with a spring holding the bulb in the socket.  the other is a 6 volt bulb and 
the light is held in by a twisting type metal hold down.  The housing doesnt 
look like they can be interchanged or is there something that I am missing? 
Any help guys and gals.....
