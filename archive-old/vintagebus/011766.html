&gt; Well I read the Idiot hand book last night and it says if the holes in
&gt; the flywheel and the crankshaft end are rounded out you have to take
em
&gt; both to a machine shop and get them redrilled. Well I guess if you
open a
&gt; can of worms that's what you get.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am going to tear down the engine and take the crankshaft out.
But I
&gt; am not a real big fan of getting the end holes redrilled. I figure
if I
&gt; got it out, Replace it with a new one....But will it effect the engine
&gt; performance because a new one will not have the same wear pattern as
the
&gt; old. 

From what I see, you have two possible routes.  

If you get the crank and flywheel redrilled, then you can just bolt
everything back together and have whatevever quality engine existed
before the failure.  Since you didn't have it then, you are really
dealing with a &quot;pig in a poke&quot; here.

If you decide to replace the crank and flywheel, you will have to
replace all the bearings to match.  Since you're into the engine this
deep, it isn't much farther to a complete rebuild.

If you can afford it, the second route is the way to go.  You're
looking at a few hundred dollars difference, but you'll have a great
engine when you're done.

Have you been able to extract the flywheel from the bell housing yet?
