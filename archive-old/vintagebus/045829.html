&lt;&lt; The books say to remove a large circlip. Is this underneath the so-called
daisy?&gt;&gt;
Yes if you mean the sheet metal bolted on cover on the sides of the tranny
center section.

&lt;&lt; Do the Reduction Boxes have to come all apart first or can I remove them
and the 
 axle whole?   &gt;&gt;
Yes to the former.  Get yourself the Bentley reprint of the 1963-67 bus shop
manual ASAP!   You and your bus will be safer and much better running with
this doubly so since you are working on suspension that has to work right.
