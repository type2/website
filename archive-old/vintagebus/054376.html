Subject: Re: [VB] 8mm square socket-shift coupler

&gt; Hi. I am trying to remove the shift coupler from my
&gt; '62 crew cab without mangling the screws any worse.
&gt; They are the 8mm square-head screws. I know snap-on
&gt; makes an 8mm square socket, but I was wondering if
&gt; anyone else did? 

Everyone else has given good advice about how careful
you have to be, etc., but didn't answer your original
question.  A 5/16ths American square socket works. 
It's a litle tight, but it works.

Be careful.
