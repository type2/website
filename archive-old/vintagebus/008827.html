Some FLAPS up here in the Pacific Northwest sell GEX &quot;rebuilt&quot; engines.  The
price is close to what a new Mexican 1600DP longblock costs.

I've closely scrutinized several GEX engines on display at various FLAPS,
and every one had a variety of obvious but unrepaired [or unrepairable]
problems/defects.  I can't understand why a reputable FLAPS owner/operator
would sell such trash, let alone &quot;proudly&quot; display it for all to see.

Given the choice, there simply is no comparison.  The GEX mills have a
well-deserved reputation as being absolutely garbage [see the List archives
for extensive discussion of GEX frailties].  I've yet to hear or read of a
person dissatisfied with a new Mexican engine.

FWIW.....
