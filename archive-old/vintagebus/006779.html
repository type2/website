Actually the bug uses a bus rear flex line 211 611 775B, at least that's
what all my parts books specify. 111 611 775 is an obsolete number that's
been superceeded by the 211 611 775B.

Hi list,

Question number two for the day. Do the rear brake flex lines on a '60 bus
have a bug counterpart. I seem to remember that they were the same as those
from a seventies bug from the last replacement years ago.

TIA

Michael
