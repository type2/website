Subject: a note of warning!!!

Hi folks,
Just want to alert every one there is a bad virus on the loose. I check the
list every morning
along with the on-line local papers from Seattle. This morning there was a
returned message
among the postings from the list. It was titled  &quot;mail delivery subsystem&quot;
also  there was an attachment with
it. The message was all &quot;gobble de gook&quot;. Thank goodness I didn't open the
attachment!
I deleted it and dumped my delete file pronto. This is my first time to be hit
with one of these and
it's really frightening! I do my banking / school work and so forth by
computer. I feel as though someone just
broke into my house.
For more information on this thing go to   www.msn_dot_com
they have a run down on it with a picture.
Please use caution!!!!
Mike Turner
