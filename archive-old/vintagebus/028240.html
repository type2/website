Hey all,

I am looking for the vent section, that vents the engine compartment for my
63' panel.  Or at least one of the vent sections.  The P.O. cut out one of
the vents to (presumably), install an oil cooler of some sort.

Does any company sell this section repro?  I was given a section, when I
bought the bus, but it must be from a different year.  (It is too small)

Thanks.
