Once again Jason has a question.....actually 2.  #1 When I'm driving and I
let off the gas peddle the bus pulls to the right, if I'm driving and
instead of letting off the gas peddle I push it into neutral it doesnt.  The
guy who I bought it from said that the tranny mounts need to be replaced, so
far he has been wrong on everything he has told me so I'm not going to take
his word without hearing it from the experts (thats you guys).  Anyways I
dont want to listen to anyone who solves leaking axle boots by wrapping Duct
tape around them.

#2 Where should I go to get a new muffler and what kind ?  Also the rear
bumper has cut-outs for dual exhaust but the muffler that is on it runs down
the side and spits out the rear drivers side.

Thanks !  I hope I dont get kicked off the list for asking to many
questions.

Jason
