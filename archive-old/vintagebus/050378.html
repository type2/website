&gt;Of course you know a crank apron isn't &quot;correct&quot; for your bus, and aquiring
&gt;one will one will only beget the desire for a crank, pulley nut, and
&gt;window'd rear tin...

Actually the crank and apron is found throughout the Brazilian Split 
production years: Perhaps on the South African and Australian 
assembled buses as well. So it just might be &quot;correct&quot;.
