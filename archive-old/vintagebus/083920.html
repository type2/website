&gt; I think I'll forgo the combustion cleaning system for
&gt; the bell housing and firewall.

For oily goop, I've had pretty good luck with some of the
citrus-oil (d-limonene) cleaners - same stuff that is in
the hand cleaners, but more concentrated.  &quot;Orange Blast&quot;
comes in a spray bottle and works OK, but &quot;Zep Citrus
Cleaner and Degreaser Concentrate&quot; works better IMHO.  It's
about $9 for a gallon jug at Home Depot.  I usually use it
straight, but the label says you can dilute it if you want.
Straight, it will irritate your skin if you get a lot if it
on you, so be careful.  I find that these cleaners mostly
just dissolve the oily stuff, not wash it away - you still
need to wipe with something absorbent to get the dissolved
oil/grease off the surface.  You may want to be careful around seals and painted surfaces, but for metal stuff it seems to work well.
