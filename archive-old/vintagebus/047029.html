Hello,

&lt;&lt; From: Mark Lytle &lt;singlecab_at_centralia.wednet_dot_edu&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;.. What if I want to keep the ride height on my truck but would 
     like higher gears. ....&gt;&gt;

This is on your '59??  Still have the split case transaxle in there?

split case through may 59, so not all off them came with it, though you can 
get and adaptor if you want a tunnel in a bus that was originally split case 
(where the nose cone attaches is different)

You'll have several options.  First is that you can swap out the 
1.40 ratio redux boxes with the '64-'67 style 1.26 ratios.  That

FWIW I  doubt he has the 1.40 RGears, as those are the barndoor ones.   The 
post barndoor 55-63 ones (36mm nut) have 1.39 Rgears.
...........
would mean from the transaxle out to include the brake drums
kind of swap. Second is to find a good '64-'67 Type II trans with
the 4.125 ring and pinion ratio.  Both of those swaps will net
you about 3-4 mph more (each) for the same rpm's your engine

yes- popping up to the 3.88 w/1.39 (more tranny cost)or the 4.125 r&amp;p with 
the 1.26 RGB (meaning you should swap over to a 64-67 front beam or you 
braking power will be disproportionately in the rear- dangerous, which 
entails that work) will get you higher gearing.  

a warning:  a 3.88r&amp;p w/1.26rgboxes will mean less power on hills, 
particulary if the bus is heavily laden and/or  has large objects on the 
roofrack that increase drag.     nicer on a flat freeway though.      now i 
drove my 65 westy up to seatlle last night with a big sail of a piece of a 60 
panel on the roof- from just behind the right side cargo doors around the 
rear corner, and if had slightly more power on the way back.    So if you 
live with mountains and/or plan on doing significant hauling and less freeway 
driving, dont get a 3.88 w/1.26, go slightly lower, if you want flat freeway 
cruising and dont haul mass weight, the higher may be your best bet.

(I like split case trannies.   so good for mountain driving)
