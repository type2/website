i have not looked at our bus speedo recently, how
ever, last weekend i rebuilt a speedo for one of my
squarebacks and had to encounter this problem. the
needle is mounted on top of the d'arsenel movement, so
i was able to use a clear epoxy to &quot;glue&quot; the two
pieces together. the car is a daily driver, we will
have it at rich's and all else this weekend. time will
tell if it is a good fix. good luck,
jay
