Subject: Re: [VB] Temp/Pressure Senders

Hi Richard,
We used to worry about the teflon tape plugging one of the oil ports, but 
since we only use one layer of tape and are very carefull not to allow it to 
overhang into the hole past the male threads it is not a problem.  When we 
remove the threads from the case we make sure to clean up the tape remains 
and always find only tiny bits and pieces of the tape inside the bore.  All 
alot smaller than the metal crud that goes through stocker non-filtered 
engines.  Never had a problem with the gauges reading incorrectly with the 
teflon tape.  Eric&amp;Barb
