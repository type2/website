 OK, now that we know Powder Is Good, what color do I get? My camper started
 off as a commercial rig, so I want white wheels and gray hubcaps. And white
 bumpers. Can anyone provide the part or stock numbers of the dead-on correct
 powder?
  &gt;&gt;
well, I would like powder too.  And it would be nice to get them painted like 
the original- black where the tire sits, on the inner face, then only Silver 
White on the outside face.   So do powder coat places do that sort of thing?
