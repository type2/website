Subject: RE: [VB] For all those DIYer's

When you ever end up with extra pieces, especially DORN, Kamax, Rasche,
bolts, nuts, washers, etc etc etc... box them up and send them to:

David Mayes
807 Penn Ave
La Grande OR 97850

When they arrive, they will be lovingly cleaned, wire wheeled, and
placed in an appropriate container along with like sizes.  And then
someday USED :-)

&gt; When overhauling an engine, the biggest problem is all the extra
pieces,
&gt; what do you do with them?  Most people just scatter those pieces of
tin,
&gt; intake runners, exhaust parts and everything else all over the shop,
or if
&gt; they are somewhat organized, put them in boxes.
