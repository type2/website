I think you need to buy MY camper kit! =)

&lt;&lt; On a whim I took out my roof panels in the camper today.  They were really
starting to show their age, sagging in places and so forth.  So I'm
stacking things gently in the backyard when I notice things written on the
1&quot; X 1&quot; X 48&quot; support pieces (of wood).  It's hard to describe how the 2nd
owner set this up...it's a rather lame job (weak dark wood, etc).  Anyway,
when I set two pieces together and can make out in handwriting:

Kamper Kits
Monta Vista, CA   &lt;-- it's near Cupertino, CA

And another piece has the address for HEHR MfG. Company (they're the guys
who make all the windows in our campers).

So maybe...just maybe, I don't have a Riviera at all.  Or I do and the 2nd
owner got a new interior from Kamper Kits!  Sadly, I've found ZERO info on
Kamper Kits at type2_dot_com

Ahhhh, the mystery grows deeper each day!
