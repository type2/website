&lt;&lt; Also, we have a 67 tranny in the garage with E brake cables attached.  
would 
 it be easiest to just use those or is it better to get them new?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
You could install the E brake cables from the 1967 with no problems if you 
carefully inspect them for any signs of fraying and grease the heck out of 
them.  Personally we would buy a pair of new cable/s and install one new and 
one used on your bus/es.  That way most likely when the old cable on bus/es 
wore out the newer cable would be still in fine shape.  Thusly you would end 
up with a well staggered need to replace only one cable at a time on each 
bus.  Eric&amp;Barb
