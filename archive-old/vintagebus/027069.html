I hope those wonderful guys that administer this list on their on time decide
that a certain amount of spam like commercial  info is ok - I too like to
occasionally hear about great deals available or what the comrades have on ebay.

Somewhere there is a line and thankfully the commercial oriented list members
rarely cross it and the advertising is almost always just right on this list.
IMHO

What ever happened to that brock guy? - did anyone ever slap him? - now that was
spam.
