&gt; Bet you'll find that your flasher relay runs *really* fast - more like
&gt; a door buzzer than a blinker.  The current draw of the bulbs is an
&gt; important factor in the operating characteristics of the system.  Same
&gt; idea as why it operates twice as fast as normal when one bulb's burned
&gt; out.

I do believe the solid-state flashers arent current dependent like the old
ones that use a bimetallic strip to flash stuff.

So, a $3 part and this is a non issue, i think, can anyone confirm this?

thanks,

Steve
