Subject: 18-led light pods

So my order of the 4x6 18-led light units came in today.  The write-up
on the web page was a tad incomplete, as you might have expected.

The magnets are molded into the case, and not really removable.  They
seem strong enough to hold the light in place under reasonable
conditions, but I'm a little concerned about bumpy roads.

The brightness when on the steady setting is a little dimmer than what
I get from my running lights.  Note that I did just clean up all the
contacts in the back, so those are actually reasonably bright at this
point.

The flash setting is a little fast for a comfortable turn indication.
Not a big problem, if you slave it to the existing brake/turn light,
rather than use the internal flasher.

However, the switch is not an on-off-flash sort of thing.  It's a
tap-for-flash, tap-for-steady, tap-for-off switch.  This is going to
make things interesting, depending on how integrated the electronics
really are.  I haven't opened it up yet, but I'm going to really hope
that the switch and flasher circuit can be isolated from the led
driver circuit, rather than being one big chip.  Hopefully I can get
to that this weekend.

The bottom line at this point is that I'm less excited about these
units than I was previously, but there's still potential there.
