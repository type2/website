Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto

50 bucks an hour!!???  I got to get into the VW body biz.  Who said TV was
where the money was???

Skip the entire body POR-15 crap...no need to.  A good blast and metal
prep, then a quality etch or epoxy prime is all that is needed.  POR 15
over fresh blasted body is WAY overkill.  Plus you'll need the tie coat
primer on top of the 15 if you wait too long.

&gt; 
&gt; I have never paid for a full on restoration but a close friend of mine
&gt; just got a bid on his 67 Double Cab and I was going to see if any of you
&gt; had some input on cost and maybe some other places he should look into.
&gt; He has all of the welding completed and the quote is for sandblasting
&gt; and then POR 15 the whole double cab and then bodywork and primer. The
&gt; bodywork is the smoothing process not welding in major panels as that
&gt; has been done already. The quote was for $4700.
