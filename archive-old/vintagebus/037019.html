Thanks for the compliment.  We are not holding a buses on the blue ridge this
year.  I am taking some time off to fix my 58 hard top deluxe.  I know it is
an event that many people have come to enjoy, and we will return with an event
next year.  I know I will have more enthusiasm, and my 58 might be running and
rust free by then as well.
