to recover your seats. It was shot at West Coast Classics, one of the =
best
out there and is an excellent article

First of all I would suggest taking out the string
they put so you can pull the cover tight and replace
it with a durable bayling wire. The string isn't
strong enough and the factory used wire anyway.

&gt; OK, so I have the new seat covers and horsehair pads

&gt; what

&gt; upholsterist, upholsterer or what ever, I haven't
&gt; the

&gt; figure that I could just slap the pads on and yank

&gt; HELP! (again...)
&gt; Many thanks in advance!
