When started cold, it runs good, but when the auto-choke reaches approx.
the second to last notch, it dies out.  I tried the idle adjust all the
way in, but to no avail.  The butterfly valve on the choke is shut when
cold, and open when warm.  The machanic who rebuilt the carb has been
working with VW's for quite some time, and I was recommended to him
because of this.  Didn't have this problem before the rebuild though.
If it is the wrong carb jetting, how could I tell and is this likely to
happen when getting rebuilt?

Happy driving--Chet
