Hi Greg
    I noticed that you have a canopy and tilt and was wondering if there is
any chance that I could get some detailed pictures of your hoops.  I need
pics of the plate attachment to the bed of the SC.  Also pics of the way
that the wood goes into the hoops and the shape of the metal strip that goes
above the wood.  And any other pics that would help me to make my hoops in
the hope that I can reproduce them in my friends machine shop.  Also would
love a couple pics of the way the canvas attaches to the little belts and
any other points of contention or interest
I have never had the chance to look at the way these attach and now that I
have a SC I want to make the parts as close to original as I can
Thanks for your help
