One thing to remember is that the H4 halogen lights were made to handle
60 Watts of power.  If you stick a 130 W bulb into them you are making
them handle more than twice the heat for which they are designed.  If you
go this route be sure to use quality components and check things often at
first to make sure that you don't crack or melt anything.

I used a 100W H4 bulb in my motorcycle and found that the increased heat
melted the bulb connector on the back of the light.  Later on it melted
the solder joints in the bulb itself.  This was in a OEM Bosch headlight.

Not saying you shouldn't run hot bulbs, but be careful that they don't
leave you in the dark unexpectedly.

BTW, I love the pattern that a quality H4 headlight puts out.  It has much
less glare potential than that of a sealed beam.  In fact, in the old days
when sealbeams were the rule, most of the people caught by cops for having
&quot;illegal&quot; H4s on their cars were caught because the H4 had noticably less
glare than the legal lights.

These days, they are almost unnoticable among the variety of lights
available.

&gt; Yes, Yes, Yes. IT is the only way to go. I run them on all of my cars. I
&gt; believe they even make 6 volt bulbs for them but I am not sure. In my 60
&gt; Crew Cab I run H4's with 90/130 bulbs in them. It is really nice to be able
&gt; to see very clearly. I have stock wiring with an aftermarket alternator on
&gt; the motor, but I do not use any relays or special wires. You could probably
&gt; get them a little brighter with relays. The stock H4's come with 55/60's in
&gt; them usually. If you trade them out for the brighter bulbs when you buy
&gt; them you can usually get some trade in value. The one downside to the
&gt; brighter bulbs is they do not seem to last as long. I still get about 2 to
&gt; 3 years out of them. I do aim my lights just a touch lower with the big
&gt; bulbs so as not to blind on coming vehicles. With them aimed lower no one
&gt; seems to even notice.
&gt; Hope this helps,
