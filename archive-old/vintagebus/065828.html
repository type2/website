Subject: 6volt Starter Life Span and Carb Problem

&gt; &gt; Hey all.  My starter just burnt out.  It was a 6 volt starter and I
recently
&gt; &gt; went to 12 volt w/ alternator.  I am going to put a 12 volt  in for a
&gt; &gt; replacement,
&gt;
&gt; I saw a few replies to this but no one said:
&gt; STOP!  Don't put a 12v starter in!
&gt;
&gt; Unless you pull your engine and replace the flywheel with a 12V flywheel,
you
&gt; HAVE to use a 6V starter. The ring gear teeth are a different count and
&gt; diameter. The starter drives are completely different between 6 and 12V.
Get
&gt; another 6V starter and put a 12V solenoid on it.

Are 6V and 12V flywheels interchangeable?  I have a persistant front oil
seal leak and several people have said that they reckon it is due to the
fact that I have a 6V flywheel on a 12V 1600 twin port crank.  They say that
although they go together, they do not fit properly.  Anyone have any
knowledge or experience of this - I have searched the net and have not found
any reference for this.

Thanks
Paul
