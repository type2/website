&gt; First of all there is alot of the cable you cannot see, so check to make
sure
&gt; the cable works by crawling under the bus with a flashlight and watching
the
&gt; arm on the tranny, while your friend steps on the clutch.  If the arm
moves
&gt; enought, the cable would be fine.  If the arm does not move at all your
cable
&gt;  is probably bad.  If the arm on the tranny fell off, that would be
obvious
&gt; too.

Yeah, I had Ellie step on the pedal while I was under to see what happens at
the arm. It pulled
back like it should. Reached up and yanked on the cable and it feels solid.


 I would use this opportunity to replace the fuel
&gt; line, change the tranny oil (including RGBoxes), install a new engine to
body
&gt; seal, replace the engine main seal and oil cooler seals,  or any other of
&gt; those upkeep things which is a lot easier with the motor out.  If you
hadn't
&gt; already done them.

One thing I need to do is move the throttle cable guide tube from the front
of
the shroud to the back where it is supposed to go. The po installed the
motor
with it in the wrong place so there was some cooling air leaking out of the
shroud
right into the carb. The thing is just kind of flopping around in there.
I have some duct tape over the hole for now.


I was also going to install a battery strap and cover at the same time.
All I ever see are 6v covers. Is there supposed to be a cover over the
battery on a 67??
