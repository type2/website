Subject: Re: [VB] Another Steering Box Cover question

&gt;&gt;i dont believe they have o rings.  the square cover plate with the tube
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, I found this out.  My bad...
&gt;&gt;about the shim gaskets.  they should be stuck on.  this is good, don't peel
&gt;&gt;them off, if you unstick them you better be so anal retentive about having
&gt;&gt;them clean and lined up or the box will leak.
&gt;
&gt;My box had no gaskets - just sealant.  I checked, ran the plate through the
&gt;wire wheel, looked and looked again - nothing.  So I just put in a thin
&gt;paper gasket for sealing.  I've got the box stored upright so I'll check it
&gt;in the morning to see if it leaked anything.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the advice Clara.  I'm trying 80w90 gear oil for now as per
&gt;Ronnie's suggestion.  The old stuff stank and was dark - more from age than
&gt;anything else.  I filled up the box once, worked the guts, drained it, and
&gt;refilled.  The stuff that came out was kind of streaky looking.  I think I'm
&gt;all good to go now.  Later!


Look in your Bentley manual under lubricants.  The steering box is supposed
to use some kind of 'liquid grease'.  The gear oil is acceptable as a
topping up lube.
