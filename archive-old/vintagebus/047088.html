Subject: Re: 61 23 window and others at auction in Scottsdale
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

We meet the new owner of the David O. bus on Wednesday. An autobroker  from 
Georgia. A friend of his purchased the bus for him in Sacramento. The owner 
had never seen the bus until yesterday. Bought the thing just to resell.
As for the resto on the rotisserie, anyone that has looked at the bus first 
hand knows that to be far from the truth. These guys will say anything to 
bring the top dollar.If the bus was rotisseried than why not paint the 
undercarriage. This bus has gallons of undercoating on it.
David O. did a decent job bringing that bus back to life, give him credit for 
making the attempt. 59-61 Deluxe buses are the most difficult of the Deluxes 
to restore correctly. How many have you seen with the correct door panels or 
original paint colors? 
There are four other Deluxe buses that are four sale this year at the 
Scottsdale auctions (there are four auctions going on at the same time) all 
by brokers that bought up 21 or 23's because of the hype last year.
We have already seen three out of the four, we will give you results as they 
come.
The first was a CUSTOM 58 23 window, sold Friday for 14,500. That is what the 
owner took home after paying the entry fee, and commission, besides the money 
the person dumped into the bus. Looked like a losing proposition to me. 
Strike one up original for buses.
