Subject: Re:[VB] Rear Shocks

I had been running my bus for about 8 months with no shocks. I had
someone tell me that they had removed theirs and that it had handled
better. Mine handled fine , but I think it handles a little better on
the freeway, but not much different. The shocks I put on were KYB's and
I have noticed that all of a sudden I am getting more wear on the
outside of my rear tires. Let me know if you find anything to
substantiate that.
