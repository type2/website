The purpose of this list is to discuss the repair and maintenance of a 33 to
50 year old vehicle that was intended to return to the earth in a few years
just as all other vehicles are. It has no anti-lock brakes, power steering
or brakes, no air bags, no crumple zones (drivers knees excepted) and is
notoriously underpowered and slow. It was built very economically (read
cheap) even for the times. It was not the recipient of the latest safety or
technological refinements even when new, and only because of a pretty fair
job of engineering was it acceptable then. The fact that these old vehicles
are not as safe as a new car is irrelevant, that they are even still around
is amazing. The best maintained split bus on the planet is more lacking in
safety refinements, braking, and horsepower than the oldest Pinto. It is the
driver that decides whether it is okay to head on out on the road with vise
grips on the brake lines to three wheels, a leaky wheel cylinder on the
fourth, and a wicked knock coming from the rear. It is the driver that will
determine whether the vehicle is safe. Every one of us that drives a split
bus is guilty of taking an unsafe vehicle on the road every time we drive it
by modern standards. At which point does it become reckless? How long is a
piece of string? I have had my single circuit brake system fail on me a time
or two. Wasn't from lack of maintenance, I'm picky about brakes. Just a hard
stop that blew a wheel cylinder. Chit happens. Should we all convert to dual
circuit? Nope, learn to drive the old bus safely - leave more space. Nobody
ever told a new Honda owner that it would be a good idea to carry spares and
learn to speed shift in case your clutch goes missing.

Jerome is not about dragging some crusty pile up the mountain to get
hammered. Sure, there are a bunch of ropeheads that show up, and the bongo
circle last year was so lacking in rythym that there should be a telethon in
their behalf, but that is not the majority of what goes on. Jerome is where
you can go for two days and be surrounded by people that whether young, old,
rich, poor, carnivorous, vegan, pierced, tattoed, bald, balding, or hairy as
an ape will think your old bus is cool-no matter its condition. They will
hang out in pouring rain or blistering heat and should plan on both. Slow
drags work just as well in mud, chili is excellent when it is cold out, and
nothing will warm you up like standing with a couple of hundred close
personal friends at the raffles.

The Jerome event has managed to get along pretty well the last 9 years
considering that some of you don't attend and the tenth should be no
different. Come rain or shine, the caravan will once again be heading up the
mountain in a few weeks and when the weekend is over someone will leave with
a nice shiny 60 Kombi with good brakes for a 50 cent raffle ticket. The rest
of us will be nearly as happy.

There are two kinds of people. Those that try to make Jerome every year and
those that haven't been yet.
