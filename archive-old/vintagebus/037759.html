Today I was looking through a 65ish combi, for spare parts, and noticed a brown box behind the passenger set.  At first I thought it was some sort of heater but soon found that it was a radio.  MALONE  (I think)  was written on the side and it had two knobs that stuck out on the walk way between the seats.  Is this a regular installition for a radio?
