 &gt;&gt;I believe it has a fuel pressure regulator but don't know anything about 
it and don't know if it is actually working.  I do hear the electric pump

 Hi Michael,
 Take the air cleaner off and with a small hand mirror and flashlight to peer 
down the carb throat have someone turn the ignition key on to power, but not 
start.  If the fuel soon afterwards begins to pump out of that brass pipe 
about 1/4&quot; diameter coming out of the rear of the float reserviour at an 
upward diagonal you need to:
  1.  Adjust to about 3.5 Lbs. per sq. inch. (0.25 Kg/cm sq.) maximum or 
replace your fuel pressure regulator.
  2.  Replace the reserviour float.
  3.  Replace the float shut off valve.
  4.  install the gasket between the float shut off valve and the top of the 
carb.
 
 &lt;&lt;My question is what do I need to know and due to set up a fuel injected 
engine to run on a carb?  What kind of fuel regulator do I need and where can 
I find one?  Is there anything I am missing?  What do I set the fuel  
pressure to?&gt;&gt;
 
 You also need to figure out the jetting your carb has now and what you need 
 for your year/type engine compartment, aircleaner and even the muffler!
