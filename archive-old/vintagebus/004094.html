vwhoward and rich yost (both neato members)
need help, 30 miles south of fresno on highway 99
rich started loosing gear oil out of his reduction box
upon inspection they noticed that the plastic cage around
the outer bearing is melted

1. would it be safe to drive on this say 400 miles till they reach redding?
at wolfgangs

they say there is no excessive play on the axle, but i was concerned  that
it might seize and cause some major damage, any thoughts?

2. is there anybody in or near fresno that might be able to
help them, they are in a town called kingsberry (or something like that)

or somewhere in route that they may nurse it to get help

please post to list if you can help and i will p-mail my phone#
i will be on line till i hear something or p-mail me at
ronnie_at_type2parts_dot_com

i have there cell # to contact them

thanks to the list
