Subject: Dual Carbs. (Kirins bus)

Dual carbs do not an un-reliable car make. I run duals on most of my cars and have way less problems than the 34pic 3. As far as going out of adjustment, I have run dual baby Dells, baby
Webers, 40mm Dells, 40mm Webers, and a few sets of Kadrons. None of them were hard to adjust and they basically never went out of adjustment. I think most people who are afraid of dual carbs
have never run dual carbs or never take the time to learn about them. They work great, good mileage (when jetted right) and good smooth power. I think a lot of times these carbs are run on
engines with other problems that the carbs get blamed for or they are never set up right in the first place. A lot of times engines just plain over carbed. It would be really tough to get a
stock 1600 to run well with a set of dual 48's. I do agree that Safari windows in the NW are not the best solution unless the bus will be garaged and driven between the rain drops.
just my humble opinion,
