&gt;I figure while I'm at it, I'll fix the reduction box problems.  The
&gt;driver's side rear wheel has been a little wobbly, and the box is leaking.
&gt;
&gt;I have new seals and bearings; will I need &quot;the plug,&quot; and if so, where do
&gt;I get it and what's involved in putting it in?  It's been a long time since
&gt;I've removed these gears and bearings, like 5 years or so!


The plug is only on 'big nut' redux boxes. If you have big-nutters, you'll
need them. Just remove the old one carefully and you'll have no problem.
Tack weld a bolt to it and prize it out of their, then cut and grind it back
off. They are fairly substantial, shouldnt have any trouble. I imagine their
would be a freeze plug somewhere that would fit the hole, measure one while
you have it out.
