Subject: Spare Tire Help
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I need an original tire for a spare.  Before I pony up
the $135 to Coker I wanted to see if anyone on the
list had one.  This will only be used in an emergency
(to get me to the next tire store)so it doesnt need to
be perfect. Just something in good shape with some
life left in it. I don't need the rim, just the tire.

As always, help is greatly appreciated.

Oh ya, I am looking for a 7.00 X 14 ORIGINAL tire (has
to fit in the spare tire well!)

Enjoy your day!
