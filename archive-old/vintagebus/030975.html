I made, and have seen elsewhere, something similar. It's a round tube the same size as a Bug beam
welded to mounts the same as yours. It bolts to the Bus in place of the front bumper then you hook
your Bug tow bar to it and off you go. Very nice for lowered Buses, as it moves the pivot point out
from under the Bus.
