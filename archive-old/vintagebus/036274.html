&lt;&lt; I'm one of the latter hoping to become one of the former this year. 
 Currently holding a plane reservation that puts me in PHX Thursday 9/14
 afternoon and requires me to be back at the airport Monday 9/18 AM.  I
 also have a volunteer willing to taxi me to &amp; from Jerome from Phoenix.&gt;&gt;
 

Joe, this will be my 4th Jerome, 2 in a watercooled car and 1 so far in our 
bus.  I'm sure you'll get lots of replies to this, but I'll still give you my 
opinion.  I'm not an experienced camper so keep that in mind.

 &lt;&lt;Questions from a Jerome Virgin:
 
 1. I'm clueless as to what to bring, camping/eatingwise.  Tent, sleeping
 bag, water, freezedried apricots - it would help if I knew what, if any,
 facilities are at the campground.  I realize a lot of what I bring
 depends on who I hook up with, but a general picture would be helpful.&gt;&gt;

it really does depend on who you hook up with.  if ALL you're getting is a 
ride, bring a tent (you have those right? heh heh) bring a sleeping bag and a 
chair to sit in.  we're not going to a camp ground, it's just a big flat 
piece of dirt with porta johns and that's it.  No showers, no running water, 
no ammenities, just dirt.  it's a good idea to bring plenty of water 
something to wash up with (soap, towel).  I'm sure there'll be plenty of food 
for you and plenty to drink (beer) but you might want to bring munchies.  
Jerome isnt in the desert either, it's up in the mountains and it will 
probably rain.  It does get somewhat hot in the afternoons (90's I'd say) and 
cold enough at night for me to put on pants and a jacket so come prepared
 
 2. Do people bring toys to share?  Stuff to swap?  Or is it mainly
 communing, arrhythmic drumming, griping about what a safety nazi Thom
 Fitzpatrick is?  All that's cool, just wanting an idea.

There's usually a bunch of swappers, a few vendors and other people selling 
stuff.  I havent seen too many toys.  Jerome is dusty and dirty and if your 
toys are just for show and not for sale, I'd leave em at home.....if you want 
to sell them by all means bring them.  I'm sure we'll all sit around and talk 
about Thom.  I think he expects us to.  You'll be surprised at the # of 
people there that arent involved with the list so there's plenty of other 
stuff to keep you occupied.
 
 3. I may be in need of a place to crash coming in or going out.  I'm not
 destitute, just cheap -- and figure it'd be more fun to hang with bus
 folks anyway.  Keep me in mind.

someone will offer you a place to stay (I hope)
 
 4. I *think* my Taxi mentioned something about a caravan on Friday?  If
 anyone needs a spare bus driver, please keep me in mind for that, too. 
 (If I drive someone else's bus to jerome do I still get a raffle ticket?
 :-)&gt;&gt;

You do still get a ticket I think.  Tell us who your &quot;taxi&quot; is.  The caravan 
in Saturday at 6am or so.  you really shouldnt miss this....way more busses 
than you'd ever imagine in one place.
 
 &lt;&lt;Last year when I was hoping to make it but had to bail out, I had
 several generous offers of places to flop &amp; busses to drive.  This year
 I'm almost concrete-certain, so I guess that means I won't be able to
 find anyone. ;-)&gt;&gt;
 
Ronnie's said that he has several buses he would like to have up there.  The 
problem is that he's in havasu and you're flying to phoenix. Rent a car, 
drive to havasu (200 or so miles?) leave it there and get in one of his buses

If worse comes to worse and no one offers you any help up at Jerome, I'll 
feed you....it's simple food, but better than starving.  You can also sleep 
in the fancy schmancy roof top sleeper thing we just bought.  it's about as 
comfortable as sleeping on the ground (no pad) and will esentially be like 
sleeping on a piece of plywood on our roofrack, but, it's better than being 
on the ground.  You might get rained on though...

Hope that helps

 &lt;&lt;Unless it's specific to me, please reply to the list so other Jerome
 Virgins can become enlightened!
 
 Thanks,
 Joe &gt;&gt;
