&gt; I drove it up and down the driveway today and it was
&gt; making a terrible crunching, grinding noise form the

&gt; the noise is still there.

How low was the gear oil?  If it was low (below the level of the input
shaft bearings, for sure), then damage was likely done by the low oil.

&gt; clutch out, the grinding begins, I also notice the
&gt; back axles are turning with the tranny in Neutral and

that's fairly normal....the gear oil between the gears is thick enough to
force the unloaded gears to move.

&gt; like a toasted tranny?  Maybe thats why the bus was
&gt; put out of commission in the first place???

Yeah, it rather sounds like a bearing failure.
