The defective switches I mentioned, and others I've encountered, triggered
the oil pressure light as soon as the ignition switch was turned on [exactly
as they're supposed to] and then stayed on when the engine was started.  The
oil light never did go out at any engine speed or temperature.

I suppose one could argue that this represents a &quot;fail safe&quot; design, but in
my book it's nothing more than wretched manufacturing and &quot;quality control&quot;.
