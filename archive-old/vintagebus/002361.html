&gt;&gt;So I'm thinking about some sort of low cost anti-theft device.  Is there
any
&gt;&gt;sort of consensus on the kill switch idea.

I am planning a switch on the ignition on the hot wire, that makes contact
before you begin cranking.  That way you would only have minnimal voltage
going through the switch.  Without a positive connection to complete the
loop of electricity, that puppy isn't going anywhere.
