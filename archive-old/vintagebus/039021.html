Subject: Wanted:  rear hatch locking stick as seen at Jerome 98
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8E59_at_DSNTEXSRV3&gt;

I'm trying to find one of those &quot;rear hatch locking sticks&quot; (for lack of a
better name) that I saw auctioned at Jerome Jamboree 98.

It is a device that allows you to leave your rear hatch open about 8 inches
but still have some security by locking the hatch to the bus.  If anyone has
one for sale or can get me in touch with the gentleman who makes them (in
the Arizona area maybe?) I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks.
