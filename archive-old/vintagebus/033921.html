 Well, I'm to the point where I'm finishing the nose on the panel.
 After this, there won't be a lot to do apart from the normal dings
 and dents, which brings me to the question: how should I finish 
 the bus?  I'm debating between plain dove blue or logo'd.
 
 I've always thought it would be cool to restore a panel, because
 you could paint it just about any way you wanted short of hipp-dippy.
 
 I like yellow.  I thought of pimping it up with a big Bosch logo.
 
 When buses were tarted up for commerical use, were the insides 
 painted to match, or were they left the original color inside?

The meat wagon, a 63 double door panel, is ruby red and has &quot;HAUSMANN's 
MEATS&quot; on all sides.   Since 1906  on the nose instead of AN Address and old 
style Everett, WA phone number on front doors.  Usuall gry inside.  It was in 
a shed when a friend found it w/ engine or tranny, but 67 tags, about 65K on 
the speedo, rust in placers defined by the drip in the shed's roof, BUT 
immaculate original interior, changed only by a union sticker on the air 
vent.    Peter has it now and drives around Seattle.   He found Mr Hausmann, 
who was still in the area, and thought he was nuts for being into his old 
delivery van.  Mr Hausmann had had 4 VW vans, 2 58s and 2 63s.  Wow, if he 
had 4 vans, they must have donea lot of meat.   Not sure if it was a deli or 
butcher.  And 70 K in 4 years. Hmm.
