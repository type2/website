the nose cone without dropping the tranny? and if so, could i replace 
something inside to stop the leak, or should i go about aquiring a new one? &gt;&gt;

Hi Mike,
No you can not.  So go ahead and remove the engine and tranny.  Then while 
you are in there remove and replace all the shift bushings.  Also while you 
have the tranny out drill and tap the swing plate to RGBs bolt holes deeper 
so you can install longer bolts in there!   Enjoy, Eric&amp;Barb
