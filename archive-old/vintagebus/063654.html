Yeah, the machine is the key - otherwise, you need a motor on a stand 
to put the dizzie in, run it and hit it with a timing light and a 
vacuum gauge.

every time i see a dizzy tester on ebay, they go for $600 or so, and 
are a B*TCH to ship, as they often weigh a pound per dollar!  :)

as for parts, they ARE still available, but the two or three folks 
who seem to know the sources just won't fess up (jim thompson once 
wrote me that he had a friend who repairs T3 dizzies (still does, but 
only certain ones), and wouldn't tell jim where he got the springs -
protecting his biz, but for those of you NOT needing t3 diz rebuilds, 
kinda unhelpful). i think vac cans are the worst to find, as i 
usually see 'NLA' in catalogs for em.

as for rebuilds from a flaps... i'd want to see the tester card 
showing the curve. ask for it at the flaps and watch the blank looks.
i spoke to a rebuilder who said they could provide a card for their 
dizzies if asked, and $109 for a rebuild didn't sound TOO bad. they 
have a few models in stock, said they could maybe do others. my only 
qualm is that they MAY not use all the 'correct' parts to rebuild an 
individual dizzy, and the curves may not be exact.

if you just need one off-the-shelf, here is their addy:

what would be great is if a knowledgeable Listee were to call them 
and GRILL their vw diz rebuilder on things important, and then let us 
know if they seem to know their stuff.
