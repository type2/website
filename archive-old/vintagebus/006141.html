Relayed to Dan Howard-
&gt;&lt;&lt;Dan:   I was looking at your web site.   I have a  69mm SPG ROLLER CRANK
&gt;that needs to be indexed and trued.  I have tried RIMCO, BERG, FALICON, ED
&gt;KORN, SCAT and so far have not been able to find anyone who can deal with
&gt;this crank.
&gt;Do you know of anyone who is familiar with and can index and align this crank
&gt;or have any leads as to who might be able to do it??

As was previously passed to me, any motorcycle shop with access to competent
crankshaft skills can take care of this. piece o'cake. What have those other guys
been telling you ?!
Dave
