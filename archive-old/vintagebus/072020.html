&gt; Now when I look at it-it seems kind of cocked to one side, and I don't 
&gt; remember if it was always like this or not. I am thinking maybe the pin on mine 
&gt; is bent/broken somehow, and that is why it was so hard to move.
&gt; Except that it moves pretty good now..

Hi Kevin,
We doubt that the pin has broken.  More than likely the rust in there has 
acted as a honing grit and worn out the bore of the handle.  Best bet is to take 
apart another bus for parts in this area and then get your's apart to see what 
needs replacement/repair.
