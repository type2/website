&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt; Why not get good used VDO gauges, and new senders?  VW

&gt; quality VDO gauges here in the US, and can easily be found in 
&gt; almost every 
&gt; wrecking yard.  Did they not use the same out your way?


Hi, 

Yes they did. Ours were called Golf 1 and the GTS and GTI versions had a
cluster of three gauges(ammeter, oil temp, oil pressure) just ahead of the
gearlever. 

It's a great idea as there is probably at least one of these cars in every
junk yard that I have ever seen. I can just replace the ammeter with a head
temp gauge and I would be away.

Thanks for the idea.

later
