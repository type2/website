Good to see all the AZ guys work on their buses like me.  Shirtless and in flip flops!  Nothing like b'n safety conscious ;-)  BTW that bus is 50 times nicer than that no windowed, cut wheel well flamed panel Dave and the S_at_TO people raffled off.  Why anyone would spend the time to PAINT flames on a bus with cut wheel wells is beyond me.  

Anyway, great job and giver of the year award goes to Katie for re-donating the bus for the raffle!  Wish I were going to see it completed in person.
