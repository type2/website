&gt;So on a more serious note I have a problem with my '66 1300 Kaefer that
&gt;I am somewhat baffled by.  [...]  I notice that if I park with the drivers
&gt;side tilted to the left, such as on a street with a pronounced road crown,
&gt;I get oil smoke upon startup, which clears itself after running.  If the
&gt;car is level or tilted to the right I have no problem..never. 

Here's an idea...when you shut the engine off, most of the oil drains
back to the sump, right?  On the left side you have the oil cooler,
which is above the level of the cylinders and valves, and presumably
will have oil draining out of it.  Maybe this is how oil is sneaking
into your cylinders on the left.  Or maybe ich bin spraechen durch
meinem Auspuff and the oiling circuits don't work this way.

FWIW, my friend's BMW R75/6 (2cyl. boxer) motorcycle does the same thing.
If you put it on the centerstand it starts up clean; if you leave it
on the kickstand (tilted to the left) you can keep the bad guys from
following you with the smokescreen it makes out of the left tailpipe
on startup.  I think the rings are probably a bit worn, but from
what I understand, even freshly-rebuilt, properly-broken-in BMW boxers
will do this.
