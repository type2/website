Volks,

I have been doing some research on rust removal, prior to tackling my new
aquisition.  I found that there are two systems that are quite interesting
to me.

The first, for smaller bits is electrolytic rust removal.  The idea here
is that you take the rusted bit and a sacrificial bit and put both in a
plastic tub filled with a water/washing soda solution.  Hook a battery
charger to each piece (+ to the sacrificial bit, - to the rusted part) and
let it go for a couple of hours to overnight.  the current removes the
Oxygen ions from the rust and the rusty bit becomes rust free!

Now I have some questions on this starting with &quot;Has anyone tried this?&quot;,
but continuing to equivalent cathode/anodes.  The sites I have seen have
all been concerned with &quot;American Iron&quot; in one form or another (except for
the Morris Minor page :-) and as such are concerned with removing
corrosion form iron (rust).  I imagine that removing corrosion from Al and
Mg would involve the same process, but that you would have to use a
similar cathode (sacrificial bit)? Check? Any of the physics majors out
there (think: George :-) want to comment on appropriate anode/cathode
combinations?  correct my misimpressions on how simple this process is?

For those seaking more info, a short search of the archives found this
interesting post from Tom Good:

http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\Y1999\October\11335

It is on the reverse of what I am speaking of, but gives a good link to a
table of electronegativities.  Question is, am I better off using the most
active, least active, or most similar?

Also a nice set of posts by Erin Lassley on derusting a rim using this
method:
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\Y1999\March\2235
is one with a link to the page with the settup.  To see the rest, search
using the key word &quot;electrolysis&quot;

The second interesting process that I came across is more for major bits
(like the whole body)  It is a caustic solution dip that removes
*everything* from the body, including any Al or Mg bits you forgot to take
off.  The advantage is that you get to start from ground 0 and see all the
damage...  the disadvantage, of course is that you have to look at all
that damage :-)  I seriously doubt that I will go this far at this time,
but would love to hear any experiences anyone has had.  Does anyone make a
tank big enough to accept a whole VW bus body?????
