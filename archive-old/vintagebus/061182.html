Subject: Re: [VB] IRS boot

&gt; The Idiot's book says that the IRS boot is nothing to do with
&gt; the trans oil leak but only protects the CV joint from dust.
&gt;
&gt; Supposing Muhr is right, should I change the side trans seal also?
&gt; If so, can I go through without pulling the engine?

Muir is correct. The side plates only need to be done if they are leaking.
