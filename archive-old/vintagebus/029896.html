I stand corrected! After looking closely again at quite a few photos I'm
sure that all two tone buses from 50 through 67 were painted
bottom color first entirely then top color whether White, BG, CNB or whatever.

Again a good example 62 deluxe http://hannoverwerks_dot_com/62deluxe1.html
shows this clearly on the roof.

&gt; &gt; Is it possible that the color that was
&gt; &gt; sprayed first on the entire bus was the interior color and that the top or
&gt; &gt; bottom 2nd color was done after?

It seems that this was taken at a different approach. Two tone buses in
the 50's had the bottom color as the interior color. starting in 59 bus
interiors I think were painted using the top color. Also 50's buses were
dark on top and light color on bottom, 59-67 buses were light on top and
darker on bottom.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Guys, from what OG two tone buses I've seen the factory norm was from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
&gt; &gt; &gt; the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; beltline. 59 and on the top color whether it be grey-biege, cumulus
&gt; &gt; &gt; white or whatever was painted over the entire bus and the bottom color
&gt; &gt; &gt; was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the beltline down.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Evidence can be seen when the OG paint fades and shows the base color
&gt; &gt; &gt; through i.e. the 20K SWR G-B 23 window at OCTO in June, you could see
&gt; &gt; &gt; spots of grey-beige coming through the sealing wax red. Then look at a
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of faded deluxes and standards and such from the 50's and you'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; always see the bottom color coming through the top color.
