Subject: RE; I need to get rid of some metal.

Matt those &quot;top hat sections you are are refering to are called &quot;side member
, universal, Ect&quot; That not the inner rocker, to be honest i have no idea
what they are i have never seen them on any splitty, but i did the same
thing a few years ago form them , the inner rocker is called a floor
reinforcement outr 60&quot; long x 3&quot; high,, PN:211 801 393and priced at 21.95 by
an old catalog i have here.   The section you are calling top hats are not
the same as a top hat but close and are too short to span the width of the
bus,,, been there did that , send'em back and they will replace them. As for
the front floor sections , i haven't found anyone's that fit and beleive me
i have tried them all. But i can take them and modify them to work. RMMW
jack supports are thin as are their outriggers and i will not use them of my
own accord, if you insist i'll put'em on but they are your babies as soon as
i'm done.
later
