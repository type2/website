As long as it is a 356 or early 912 engine (not a 76 912) it will bolt right
in. You will have to modify the tin and also fab up some throttle linkage.
Porsche used solid linkage (no cables) and have a bell crank on the back of
the fan shroud where the throttle rod connects. Try not to destroy the
original engine tin as it is rare $$$. You will also have to modify the
exhaust to fit, don't destroy the original muffler if it still has it, I
might have a used header in my Porsche stash. Be prepared for some great
RPM's, depending on which engine you have the red-line is anywhere from 5500
to 7000 and you can cruise all day at 4000 without a problem, but watch out
for the lack of low end torque.

Please just read the whole post before jumping to any conclusions.

Can anyone tell me if a late 60's Porsche engine (I don't mean type 4) will
EASILY fit into a bus? Other than that 3 piece case they look real
similar...

I have a 64 bus but I have no good engine (rod through the case). Buying the
bus
cleaned me out so it's on blocks until I save the funds to build myself a
top
quality 1600dp. In the meantime, I would love to drive this bus. I've had no
luck in scrounging up a VW engine for free, but... yes, an offer of a
genuine
Porsche engine. Who would have guessed? Too bad I don't have a Porsche. Do
you
think I use it until I build an engine that doesn't require $900 parts?

I would like to think that there are people crazy enough to have put Porsche
engines in their VWs. Anyone know how it worked out?

Thanks,
Joel
