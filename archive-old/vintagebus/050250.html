I think it's also a good idea to keep copies of classified ads and things
like that as well. I think there's a feeling that you can get an appraisal
made for just about any value you want if you pay for it. Having classified
ads from newspapers, the net, and trader mags help back up the value in the
event you ever need more justification. Nice to have the pictures as well.
My 2.5 cents.
