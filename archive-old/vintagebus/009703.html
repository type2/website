Try to say the subject three times fast!
But seriously folks...
I'm in the process of redoing the rack that came  
with our new 62 Westy. There's not enough of 
the original finish left on it to tell if it's a gloss,
semi gloss, or flat. Also, does anyone have a 
suggestion for a correct color or brand of wood finish that I could 
get at local hardware store that will give me that &quot;original&quot;
color?
TIA
