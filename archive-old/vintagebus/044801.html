Hey---
I'm pretty sure you can succesfully use a 6V (pre67) gas gauge w/ 12 volt 
electrics. Is your sender grounded right? It almost sounds like a wiring 
issue or just a bad gauge. Good luck finding that '67 only gauge (last i saw 
on ebay went for well over 100$ ouch) without spending an arm and a leg.

Good Luck--
