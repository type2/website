Subject: [VB] More on fuel line ...
Message-ID: &lt;386B7705.358CDCD1_at_nacorp_dot_com&gt;

Hey, all Type 2sters:

I'm sure we're all sick of hearing about fuel line, but have patience,
I'm a bus novice. My question is about my '82 Westy ... I couldn't find
any reference to in the archive.

After hearing all the horror stories, I'm going to replace all my rubber
fuel lines into the engine compartment and on the fuel rail ... who
knows when they were done last.

** But what about the cheesy plastic lines that runs under the Westy and
hook into the rubber lines in the engine compartment?? **

After using metal tube and metal braided lines on newer fuel injected
VWs, this seems very under-engineered, even with lower fuel pressure. Am
I overly paranoid?

Thanks!
-Dana
