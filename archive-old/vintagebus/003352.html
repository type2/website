Well today I got the motor out of my bus to change the front oil seal
and something is strange. There wasn't oil all over the clutch or
pressure plate. Shouldn't there have been? Can't finish the job until
tommorrow because of a family reunion. But I was wondering what else
could have caused my oil leak. I still plan on replacing the front seal,
but am just curious as to the lack of oil.       Thaks for all the help.

===============

Okay Shawn - now that the motor is out, you will want to replace a few
things if you haven't already even if you doubt whether they need replacing
or not, just do it.

First off, replace the input shaft seal on the tranny if you haven't
already - no ands, ifs, or buts - do it or it will fail on your way to
BNNTA.  BTDT

Next, you will want to yoink the flywheel and inspect behind it.  Don't
clean anything - just look really close for cracks and oily surfaces -
especially on the #3 side.

Also very important - check the cam plug area - this can fail and leak.  If
it is, the only recourse for proper repair is to split the case.  To get me
to BNNTA though, I would really scrub this area clean with carb cleaner or
brake cleaner and then pack the area with RTV - allowing a full day to cure.
Sure it ain't a permanent fix but it'll get you where you need to go.

Replace the flywheel oil seal if you haven't already and if you have a
flywheel with internal o-ring, replace it - also with a bar none, period,
NQA approach - do it or it will fail - especially if the bus sat for awhile
before you got it.

If you still have a leak after all of this, it's most likely a cracked case
but you would still pour oil into it to get you to BNNTA and back.

Per my last message and a few other ones, you really need to check the crank
endplay as well.

Everytime I pull an engine on a dub and I know it has not been pulled in a
while, I do the above steps with religeous fervor. Sure - go ahead and skip
a step or 2 and sir murphy will find you shortly.  BTDT!

Keep us posted!!!
