Subject: Re: [VB] Speaking of Wiper Arms...

Just before Type2 got its new guts, there was a thread about the VWofA
recall of wiper arms.  What ended up with this?  I looked up the NHTSA
site about the issue, but what do I do armed with that information?  Did
anyone follow through with this?

In the dark like I'm using 6 volt headlamps,

Adam
