 this is a rant that has me upset, many items are listed on the list for sale,
i take this as an offering to listys to have first shot at an item that they
need to finish,start
 or help in keeping there type 2 on the road, the list is for vintage type 2
owners, i feel that if you are going to put some item up for sale on the list
you did it for the sake of a listy that needs it, so let them have the first
shot at it! i have responded to many items for sale on the list but yet have
to purchase any, i've been the first person,said i would take it and tried to
make arrangments for pick-up and/or shipping but when it comes down to it i
get the response (after waiting) that i sold it to my neighbor
 put it on the street and sold it, a guy came by and bought &gt;&gt;

I am sorry that I can't agree with you.   Although I have bought some things
from listees, I have also contacted people about things and had another listee
get them first.  Oh well, that is how it goes.   What is the difference
between selling it to a listee or non listee?   At least you weren't out a
toll call.   Maybe look at it as someone had something they wanted to let go,
and the list was one of maybe more places they told people about it.  Anyway,
I hope you find the bits you need for your bus, I am sure with a little
patience they will appear.  The chase is part of the fun.
