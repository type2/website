Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

If you still have parts to replace I dont really get the advantage.
A permanent washable filter would be nice.


&gt; I have the glass fuel filter and have used them in the past. No complaints,
&gt; not prone to clogging or leaking, but I have broken one. Glass can be
&gt; problematic.
&gt;
&gt; Happy Friday.  While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and bought a
&gt; re-usable fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the
&gt; replaceable screen inside. My question: Has anyone used these, and if so, do
&gt; they leak or clog easily?? Adversely, do they filter finely enough?
