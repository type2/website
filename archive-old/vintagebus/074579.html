&gt; also, theses were only added ~ 65.  so there are 64 axle tubes around that do
&gt; not have places for the bumpers to stick on.
&gt; 
&gt; so either you can try to stick something in there, or not worry about it.  I'm
&gt; not sure how much they do anyway.

Hmmmm.  I've got em on my 63 DC. Does that mean I have a later front beam? I
did replace the bumpers-they are easy to do.

Tom Buese-the forensic analysis of my fleet continues.
