Subject: Re: [VB] Look at this photo please...

Hi John,
Yes you have one of those deep sumps in the photo.  We just removed on of 
these of Eric's sister's 69 Candian Camper conversion.  Two of the four studs 
holding it on had stripped out and there was no oil strainer to keep large 
pieces of debis from going directly to the oil pump.  Unless you are going to 
do Le Manns heavy cornering racing, it is best to remove it!   Eric&amp;Barb
