Subject: RE: Carbs....was Air Cooled Rant

Like several folks suggested, it was a problem with the fuel cutoff. And,
boy it was.

The engine has an older pump, and an external cutoff that was not hooked
up. Eeeech. So, fuel siphoned into the carb and then into the crankcase.
I'd say almost 1/2 gallon of gas got into the crankcase. Good thing it
never did start. The level was almost to the top of the dipstick.

So, I pulled everything apart, and tested the cutoff by blowing through
it. It is good.

I need to get some good german braided fuel hose and clamps, and put
everything back together the proper way. Oh, and drain and replace the
crankcase.

Man, that was a fire waiting to happen!

And, here I am screwing with the engine when I should be doind body work.
(but, it's always helpful to have project vehicles that run...)
