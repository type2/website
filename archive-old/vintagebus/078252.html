Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight Relay for 1967

You could carefully open the relay up and clean and re-spring the leaf
contact. Clean the contact surfaces lightly with a light abrasive - don't
remove the plating, but clean the contacts up. Then make sure that the
mechanism that latches the leaf into the two positions is clean and
working smoothly. If not, then diagnose and repair (usually just bending
things slightly), and reassemble and test. If it's okay, then remove the
cover again, and seal the periphery with silicone sealer and reassemble.
Fixed mine decades ago, still works fine. Cost: one hour's time.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; Is there a commonly available relay for the headlights on a '67 bus?  My
&gt; hi-beams are stuck on and no amount of connection cleaning or banging a
&gt; wrench against the relay will free it up.  Every time I toggle my turn
&gt; signal switch I can hear the box click, but nothing happens.
