Steve--

These were actually #12 sheet metal screws with hexhead tops so I could
tighten them down (from underneath) with a mini socket wrench.  They
held quite well in this wood.  By pre-drilling, I meant that I drilled
smaller-diameter guide holes into the undersides of the slats, to
prevent splitting the wood with the screws.  Hope that clears things up
for you.

BTW Randy's VW Parts on the left coast has (or had) a good deal for the
doublecab repros, around $125 (early last year) plus shipping, without
hardware.  As opposed to another fellow who occassionally offers a set
at that popular Internet auction site for over $300 (with hardware).

&gt; Pan head?  Pan head machine screws?  Did you put inserts in the pre drilled
&gt; holes?  Am I thinking of something different?  Are the screws you used wood
&gt; screws?
&gt; 
&gt; Curious as I'll eventually splurge for slats for my working DC.

&gt; &gt; FWIW last year I installed my repro set of wood bedslats using #12
&gt; &gt; half-inch panhead screws from underneath.  The screw is a perfect size
&gt; &gt; and shape for the factory-drilled holes in the bed.  This leaves an
&gt; &gt; unbroken surface on top when viewing the result.  I carefully predrilled
&gt; &gt; screw holes in the underside of each slat using a drill stop.  Also used
&gt; &gt; snippets of bicycle innertube for sealing gaskets.  I know it's not
&gt; &gt; stock, but I think the unbroken look is nice, leaves no screwhead or
&gt; &gt; rivet hole edges for snags, and leaves the wood slats less susceptible
&gt; &gt; to breaking.
