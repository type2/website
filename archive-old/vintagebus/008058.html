if you look at an old issue of HVW there is an artical on how to
solve your problem.
i have installed over 15 new (factory 1600) engines using pict 34
and 009 dizzy, to solove the hesitation all i had to do was change the
main jet from the 125 that they come with to a 150 or155 main
change the acc. pump setting just a #_at_$# hair ,fool with the timing a twit
and loo and behold no hessitation, this has been a combo for years and
has worked fine for years but as the smog laws came leaner carbs were built
don't blow off what you have as of yet try the 150 main and you will see a
difference
plus these engines average 20+ mpg in a bus and up to 30 mpg in a manx copy
my single port 1776 in my bus has a new pict 34 and 009 dizzy ask ellis how
i blew
past him in the fully loaded panel on I 10 coming from pomona, also my 66
westy
has a stock 1600 with a 009 and a pict 34 no problem, also i think howards
binz
just made it from az to new hamshire had a new pict 34 and 009, not to
praise the
009 or carb, but yes they will work together with a little thought, i still
use vacuum
advance dizzys but heres another deal, check the numbers on them there is a
lot of
changes in them some retard more then others, have a different advance cure
etc.
i found this out by taking a bunch of vacuum advance dizzys and useing my
vacula
to pull on the diaphram and watching the retard and advances then checking
the numbers in my bosch bible and writting what year engines they went to
ie: 73 thing
had it's own dizzy out of at least 10 i only had 2 pair of the same year and
model.

my first order from england (sheet metal) will be living in the next couple
of weeks
if you have a need  and would like to get yours in the first shippment
contact me soon
thanks to all on the list that have ordered and those that will be, it's all
of you that helped
make this happen, thanks
