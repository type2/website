&gt; I just received some new german seals from Ronnie.   For fun, I &quot;scanned&quot;
&gt; all of the different seals, in order to show the differences in quality.

The Blue German ones (VW-AUDI) seem more rubbery.  The Mexican ones have a
more plastic feel to them. The Black German ones look more like the
material in the Mexican ones, but I didn't feel them.  For $4 extra per
side I'll go for not pulling things apart again.  The German ones have
little x's all arount the lip that I assume reinforce the lip some.  The
Mexican ones don't have this.  
Now a quick(?) update on transmissions.  Got a 3.88 Rancho with smallnut
from Ronnie a few weeks ago and have been doing that among other things.  
I actually received it well before it was promised.
My 58 goes 70mph now. (at least that's the speedo reading with 215 75 15
tires)   I'm not sure I'd drive it long there, but it's real
comforatable at 65-67.  This is with a stock 1600DP.  First gear is taking
some getting used to.  With the splitcase I could throw it in 1st and let
it walk away at idle.  Now I've got to give it some
gas.  Still I'm not unhappy with its hill climbing abilities.  Now I'm not
so afraid of getting a very large semi truck implanted from behind which
is a good thing.  I am listening to noises it makes and being somewhat
paranoid about them all, then I think, this transmission is new and way
quieter than the old one, and after all it is a panel, and I've never
driven it over 57mph.  It stays pretty quiet in the 55mph range.  It could
be tire noise too.  I have SUV tires on it.  The trans shifts very nicely
for a newly rebuilt transmission.  After break in on the Sta-lube GL-4 I
plan on putting in Redline MT-4 and those German seals.   
I've been putting together a bignut with the Brazilian bug tranny
in it.  Yeah I know it won't be the same.  I'll get some big Chevy tires 
and cut the wheelwells out and it will all work out.(emoticon here)
It goes in a bus I'm getting from JP that is going to be an around town
bus anyway.  I plan on putting together a more detailed write up about
putting the Rancho into my 58 one of these days. 
One more weekend of hurting my back and then maybe I can drive these
things instead of work on them.
