&lt;&lt; I'd like to get the axles level when doing this and would like to know how 
to use the chain and jack method to keep the vehicle in place while setting 
the axle to the correct height. &gt;&gt;

Hi Thomas,
You do not need to get the axles level to install the axle boots.  The main 
thing is to install the split boots with the seam 30-45 degrees from TDC.  If 
you have the seam on the forward side of the axle you can replace it later 
with the engine in easily.  Well fairly easily....
