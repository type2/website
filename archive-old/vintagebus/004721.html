I have a friend who swears by using oven cleaner on his engine, then runs it
around for a while, then washes it off.

His always looks nice.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;well, I have done this a number of times, and the case hasn't cracked
yet.
&gt; &gt; [...] I have also driven from off the freeway down the parkway and there
&gt; &gt;was a huge puddle
&gt;
&gt; I wasn't thinking about that but yeah, it'd be a lot more common to hit
&gt; a puddle with a hot engine and if this was going to crack cases it would
&gt; probably have done so already.
&gt;
&gt; I had heard a story of a motorcycle crankcase being cracked by a
&gt; hot-off-the-highway wash attempt, but again, they hit puddles too.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I just worry too much.  :)
