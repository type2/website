&gt;Here's the problem:  In the driveway, the engine sounds and runs great.
&gt;Idles smooth at 900 rpm, revs easily to 4000 rpm.  When I take it for a
&gt;test drive, it's VERY sluggish.  Feels like it can't get out of it's own
&gt;way.  Going up the very mild hill in front of my house (the kind of hill
&gt;that a bicyclist doesn't break a sweat on), I can't even get up to
&gt;30mph.  For all the world, it feels like the thing is running on 2 or 3
&gt;cylinders.  With patience, I can get up to 3000 rpms for the shift to
&gt;each gear, but it doesn't matter how long I keep my foot on the gas, it
&gt;just won't get much past that.  When I get impatient and push the gas
&gt;pedal to the floor, the tone of the engine changes and sounds like it is
&gt;spluttering.


Mike,
It sounds for all the world like it is totally leaned out. What main jets
are in the carbs? What venturi's? Emulsion tubes? When you start it from
cold, does the exhaust get flamethrower hot almost instantly? Fatten up the
mains and see if it helps.
