&gt; Hi,

&gt; Not sure too many of you folks will like this one. I am looking into doing a
&gt; Subaru engine transplant into my 64DD delivery bus/camper. I'm just tired of
 the noise and vibration of the air cooled. First criteria is that the engine
 must fit without cutting any metal off the engine compartment in case I
 don't like it and want to go back. The exterior of the bus cannot be
&gt; altered  either. I will have to cut the bolt in rear skirt to fit the
&gt; cam pulleys.

I _think_ you can get it in without cutting the body, but you will
probably have to trim the rear skirt to clear the cam belt.

&gt; Anyone out there have experience with doing this sort of transplant? I am
&gt; looking into an EJ22 engine. 2.2 liters, 140hp.  I will get a beefed up
 trans with a 3.44 r&amp;p to handle the extra power. I have found a fair amount
 of info on the web, especially from the Ausie mates. Seems they have done a
 few of them in bay buses. Two problems as I see it, the radiator and heater.
 Where do they go? A custom radiator could be installed on the side opposite
 the battery, however air flow could be a problem. I would not know until its
 installed and run. Being a DD, there is a belly pan that eliminates the
&gt; underside for the radiator. The hollow area under the floor are actually not
&gt; a bad location in a non-DD.

Is the area under your belly pans completely boxed in?  I'm not familiar
with the belly pan reinforcement, but if is bridges the frame rails it
might make a good duct for your cooling system with a radiator mounted
under the bus.  You will also need a throttle body inverter or to flip the
intake manifold around for clearance.  Another item is a shortened sump
for ground clearance.

aussieveedubbers_dot_com and shoptalkforums_dot_com are sites friendly to engine
conversion folks.  Lots of good info there

subynotch_dot_com is a site illustrating the install of a EJ20 into a
notchback.

&gt; Outback Motor Sports (www.outbackmotors_dot_com) is not far from me and I have
&gt; talked to them. They do dune buggies and specialize in Subaru's modified for
&gt; hi power.

How &quot;friendly&quot; would they be in supplying parts for a bus swap?  Buses
really don't need those pretty 500HP turbo engines they sell, but they
have a few nice bits to offer.
