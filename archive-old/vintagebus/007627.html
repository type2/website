&gt;I mentioned two problems:
&gt;
&gt;one:
&gt;
&gt;low oil pressure once it warmed up

&gt;other:   low power- not wanting to get up to speed, not wanting top pull
hills
&gt;in 4th or even sometimes having problems pulling in 3rd.


I'd guess that the low oil pressure has to do with gas in the oil from the
rich running. On the low power, I'd guess that you dropped a tequila cork in
the carb as you were re-jetting and this resulted in too small a venturi at
higher rpm's.
