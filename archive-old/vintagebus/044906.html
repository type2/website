I received the same e-mail a couple years ago...got a ticket...tried 
it....they sent my check back to me with a letter stating I had 10 days to 
return the letter with the correct amount.  I say URBAN LEGEND!  Or the DMV's 
of America caught on.

&lt;&lt; Supposedly the author of the email verified this with a buddy of his that
 works on DMV computers or has done programming on them.  What you do is say
 for instance, you receive a ticket for $75.  You send in your check for an
 amount a tadbit higher than the fine like $82.  The DMV will then issue you
 a refund check but when you receive it, never cash it - just sit on it.
 Supposedly the incomplete transaction never finishes it's removal of your
 points.  Sounds plausible yet hokey at the same time.  By the huge list of
 forwarded email address headers on the printout, I'm sure a handful of them
 were cops.  Act fact, these deals won't last long - you know what I mean. &gt;&gt;
