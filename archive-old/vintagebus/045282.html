Subject: Re:  [VB] Belly Pans
To: shedberg51_at_hotmail_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the belly aka sub floor pans were installed on buses with big holes in the 
roof (sun roof ) or doors on both sides, for reinforcement.   if you 62 is a 
hard top deluxe, it would not have them, if it is a sunroof bus, it should.   
  I use the term 'pedal pan' for the unboltable piece under the front 
floor/pedals.  The belly is in the midde, right, not at the front.

Believe the earlier subfloors were longer, but I am not sure when the change 
was.   I think sunroof buses are silly anyway, especially those ones with 
lots of windows on the roof.

  So were the cargo area belly pans a standard item in most buses or what?  I 
don't have these on my 62 deluxe nor see any evidence that it once had them. 
  I don't know how close to an original resto I can get but if so, should I 
put these on my &quot;to do&quot; list ?  Other than strengthening the body do they 
serve any other purposes such as sound deadening ?
