Joe,

I have heard good things about the &quot;Airvantage&quot; DA sander.  Check out http://www.autobodystore_dot_com for more information and prices.  Ask the bulletin board when you get there.  That board is much like this list.  Lots of pros there.

Subject: [VB] Random orbit sanders?


Hi gang --

Looking for recommendations regarding sanding large surface areas on my 
'65 Neunsizter (such as the roof).  I've always heard that what one 
wants is a random orbital sander to reduce swirl marks.  Yes?  Any 
recommendations on an air-powered one (especially one that I can get at 
Lowe's and use up my Xmas gift card) would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe
