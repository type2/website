Subject: Re: Redux box modification ?'s
Message-Id: &lt;l03130301b33c34e70965_at_[4.16.82.96]&gt;

Had a transmission gear made for my 1951 Ross lift truck trans at a local
machine shop which specializes in manufacturing gears for industrial
applications--cost about $300 US.  This was a simple straight cut gear with
internal spline, like upper Redux gear.  The stub axle gear would be more
complicated (read expensive).

&gt;All,
&gt;Some mechanical mate of mine suggested that it might be possible to get an
&gt;engineering firm to modify my reduction boxes by milling the case and
&gt;replacing the gears with 2 the same size give a 1:1 redux box W/O any height
&gt;loss etc. Has this been done? Is there any reason why not? Any info much
&gt;appreciated.
