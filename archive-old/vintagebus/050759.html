Hi Joe,
Thanks for the heads up, on this good news.  We found them on thier internet 
catalog for $35.00 through the bug wiper motor section.  
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=113955811b
  Problem is the new armature is listed as only fiting some not all of the 
differant manufactures 1955-64 bus and 1958-66 bug wiper motors.  They list 
it as &quot;Please verify brand of your wiper motor prior to ordering.&quot;.
  If someone orders one of these would they please list the makes of motors 
this works for?
  So the 1965-67 owners are still left out in the rain.  ;-(
Eric&amp;Barb
