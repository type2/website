Thin line tape is made to stretch and turn, the worse thing to do is do it
in pieces, these little connected areas will show up when painted. I just
take the thin line (1/4 inch) and start at the door seam and run it down and
around in the groove, if you miss, it can easily be pulled back then
reapplied. After this procedure, I use 1&quot; masking tape and paper to complete
my taping off.

Subject: [VB] Masking Nose and Beltline


Hi!

I am asking anyone who has painted their two-tone buses for advice on how to
effectively and efficiently mask the nose and beltline.  On the nose:  How
is it possible to get that very complex and delicate curve right?  I have
just spent an hour and a half just applying the 1/4&quot; Thinline tape to the
nose in 3&quot; to 6&quot; lengths to allow for corrections.  Once I get the line
right, I'll overlap with 1/2&quot; tape and then begin the paper.  Are there any
tricks or tips?

On the beltline:  Do I mask just to the lower edge of the perimeter bulge,
or do I cover over the groove underneath to start the lower color just at
the top of the panel?

Photos are more than welcome if you've got 'em...

Rain and temperature allowing, I'll have the lower part done by the end of
Wednesday.

Thanks,

Gene Cornelius
