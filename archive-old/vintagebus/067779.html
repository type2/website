&gt; Hi Thomas,
&gt; The SC tank is well forward of the rear axle and actually is much lower than
&gt; the tank in the nornal bus.  Just taking a side look at a bus and a SC where
&gt; the gas door is reveals alot!  This results in a heck of alot more room over
&gt; and behind the tank, plus no body flange to clear the tranny bellhousing
&gt; under the tank.  Which is why we have an extended hieghtwise 1968-71 bus tank
&gt; project in the works.....

Rather than try to extend the tank, why not just make one from scratch?
I've tried to section tanks and it isn't a lot of fun.

You might also check out boat outfits.  They have lots of stock sizes of
rectangular tanks in (no rust, last forever) poly plastic.  One might be
exactly what you need!
