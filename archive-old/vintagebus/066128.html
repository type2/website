Subject: Re: [VB] Split bus tow bar?

well i dont have a tow bar from mr. rustybus...but i got mine from DR. Nodzack
before he passed away, the only difference i see between my bus and my bug
bar..is the bus bar is longer due to the beam being further back on a
bus....and that the
&quot;c-channel&quot; that goes around the beam is a little bigger...the only thing id
be worried about is the bar shifting on the beam
making it uneven....my bar is about half the width than the bug bar...so hook
on muffler clamps to the ghia beam to prevent the bar from moving on the beam.
if you aint going very far i woldent be to worried..
