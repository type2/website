Scott,
[...]

I did look seriously (via net) at Gerald's bus.  We had several e-mail
conversations.  However, I ultimately passed on his '60 DC in favor of
Jeff's 63.  Although Jeff wanted $1200 more, I thought that this was easily
justified by the condition of the body.

A third DC has now been added to my mix.  I guess I should seek some more
advice, as I'm putting a LOT of value on dents and rust.

Here is what we can all compare together:

=========== Bus a)
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/dblcab.gif
Far away, not sure how much to have it shipped.  $1200 price range with no
engine.  Told body is solid, but (looking at photo) is surely needs a
professional sand blast and painting.  Plus I notice a lot of stuff missing,
headlights and stuff, right?

=========== Bus b)
http://members.aol_dot_com/GKRACHER/crewFS.html
I could have had it for $2600 and another $350 to have it shipped.
I passed on Gerald's '60, as I thought it just had two too many body
projects.  He had put a new rebuilt engine in and tranny was good... so the
price was right, but it just seemed like too much of a body project.

=========== Bus c)
http://www.ns_dot_net/~schwaia/vw/index.htm
Jeffrey Schwaia's 63, the one I was ready to purchase at $3500!  Plus $400
to have it shipped.  Needs tranny rebuild, Todd Hill in Olympia Washington
seemed the logical choice... got a quote from him... plus I would put in
higher gearing anyway.

 *********************************************************

Let's not get confused here.  I was ready to purchase c.  Then Jeff
indicated that he couldn't sell it.  I passed on b.  And I just found out
about a today, but it is pretty far away.

Was I wrong to pass on a and b?  Am I putting TOO MUCH value on body
condition?  I directly compared b and c.  The '60 with more dents and rust
at $2600 vs. the '63 with a much better body at $3500 (assuming Jeff would
have accepted this price, he was asking $3750 and said he was pretty firm).

Assuming that I know that body work (welding) and painting are out of my
skill and time area... am I right to think that $1000 doesn't purchase much
in terms of professional bodywork and paint?

In simpler terms:   Is it really practical to consider something like bus a
and pay $1200 then dump $2400 into bodywork and paint?  Can I really get the
body cleaned-up and a 1/2 decent paint job for that kind of $2400? (I'm in
Seattle area).  Again, having others do almost all the work.  My own time
will be devoted to mechanics:  electrical, tranny, engine, etc.

I'm asking for help, as I know I need it &lt;grin&gt;.

&gt;I need your help finding a split Double Cab to purchase.


Check with Gerald Kracher in Redding.  I know that currently he is &quot;off
the net&quot; until he gets a new computer.  

Gerald seems to always to be coming up with double cabs for sale.
His web page lists a '61 for $2500, this may be out of date, but...


His web page: http://members.aol_dot_com/Vwbuslvr/geralds.html
His Email: mailto:vwbuslvr_at_aol_dot_com

You might try checking in with BusBoys in Redding and see if they know
how to reach him.
