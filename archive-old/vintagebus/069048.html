Subject: Oilproof Loctite?

A couple of people said they reuse the big nut on the inner end of the stub axle in the redux boxes, but put loctite on it.  Several said to be sure to 
use a formula that won't break down in the tranny oil.

I went to the loctite site and browsed &quot;removable strength threadlockers&quot; and it looks like formula 243 is the animal I want?  cf. 
http://www.loctite_dot_com/catalog/product.html?ProductLine=243.  Says:

&quot;Threadlocker 243 - Med Strength, Oil Tolerant 

&quot;A removable strength, general-purpose threadlocking adhesive especially well suited for fasteners between 1/4&quot; and 3/4&quot; diameter. Tolerant of oil 
and other contamination. Protects threads from rust and corrosion. Cures reliably even on stainless steel. Available Worldwide

&quot;Applications: Machine tools, presses, pumps, compressors, mounting bolts, gearboxes. &quot;

Dem what knows - does this sound right?

Thanks,
Joe Clark
