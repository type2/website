 I don't think the sensor is good for anything.
I installed one of those before my drive from PA to TX. About 45 mins into
the trip it started flickering. I was freaking out! Turned around and went
back home. Checked to see if it was working correctly in some boiling
water
and it was ok. This was in my brand new engine with about 300 miles on it
and cool temps outside (around 70 degrees)(1776 longblock from mofoco) (No
flames please!). I called them up and they said the temps were fine. I
took
out the g.b. sensor out and went with the stock one. That was last July,
well I made it to TX with no problems and have been all over the state in
90-110 degree heat quite often and have had no problems at all.
