Who all is going to the Puyallup show by Seattle? It would be kind of
cool to hook up some place and get to meet each other. Either the night
before or maybe for lunch. I will be there with either the 23 Window or
the Double Cab. Let's see if we can work something up. Also anyone
going up from the Portland area, the Gorge VW club should have about
three busses going up the day before the show, if you like to caravan
let me know.
See ya,
Craig
the Gorge VW club
