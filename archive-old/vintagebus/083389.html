Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor question

Clara, thanks, that sure sounds relevant.  I'm going to dive into it this morning, so I'll keep an eye out for the 10mm screw.
 
I wish I was near Tacoma so that I could drive over and get some pointers, but I'm across the country, in the Appalachian mountains (where corn winds up in mason jars instead of ethanol...)

&lt;someone had the motor out at some point.   
&lt;You have to undo a certain 10mm screw and 
&lt;reset the postion of the safts.   I could show you , 
&gt;but it's hard to explain.  Where are you at?   
&gt;I'll try to take a pic of the thing that needs adjusting.
