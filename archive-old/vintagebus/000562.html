re liscense plate on barndoor decklids, mine has it there. Mounted under the 
liscense plate light.   It's a  53 standard, originally sold in Holland, I 
got it in Eastern Washington state with 66 tags on the old style (wider ) 
liscence plates they refused to issue new tags for, had new plates on it for 
a while, then got old ones (1950 with '53 tags- J reg for Thurston county) 
and registered it as a classic vehicle, which in this great state means I 
never pay registration again, and I have it comprehensively insured at a low 
fee.  :)  Yes there are holes drilled in the decklid, don't know when that 
was done.    the front bumper has threaded bits in it.  This bus never had a 
rear bumper.
