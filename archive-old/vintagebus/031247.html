&gt; I have the correct gauge metal from my parts of my bus that I could use. Spot
&gt; weld the strips it in at the bottom, sides and top after measuring the depth

That's what I would have said, but you'll have to plug weld them in.  I don't
think you could get the tongs inside the channel with a conventional spot
welder.  Drill evenly spaced holes on the exterior frame and then clamp the
mocked up frame inside the exterior frame and plug weld away.  Seems like it
would work.
