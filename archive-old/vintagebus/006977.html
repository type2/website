I have used both the horse hair (WW) and TMI's foam. I personally prefer the
foam as it is a lot more comfortable then the horse hair padding. It's all a
matter of preference. I have never had a problem with the TMI foam as far as
fit and there covers also fit well and are easy to install. Long term I have
had the seats done in my DD for almost 2 years (40,000 miles) now and they
still sit as new, I have installed the horse hair also in a bus 3 years ago,
but this bus doesn't get driven much so I can't give a long term report on
these except thet they sit hard, kind of like Mercedes seats or BMW.
