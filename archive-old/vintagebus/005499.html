Do we reserve the right to all the Busses on the face of the earth?
Do you think that someone from another country will not love his or her bus

Silly,

&gt; Who cares where the buses go? It'll go to a human on this planet, right?
I'll draw the line at interplanetary and cross-species bus sales. Call me a
bigot, but who knows what methane gas at 200c will do to rockers, much less
the damage done to vinyl seats by carborundum bib-overalls.
