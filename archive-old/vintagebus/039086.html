Subject: Throwout bearing question
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 1998 09:46:06 -0500

(sigh) I've done it again.  When I removed the 74 bug engine from my 58
sc with 12v conversion and 66 bus tranny, I knew I was going to replace
the clutch so I also removed the throwout bearing and threw it out.  I
bought a clutch kit from Bus Depot and installed it.  When I got ready
to install the throwout bearing, I couldn't remember how the old one
came off (its been over 7 months!) and none of my manuals really show
how to do it.  

So after eyeballing it for a bit, I decided those little spring clips
must slip over the arm and settle into the notches on the back of the
arm.  Anyway, that's what I went with.  Now (of course I've already got
the engine in) I'm starting to worry that maybe I've got the wrong
throwout bearing.  Were they different for different year buses and/or
bugs?  And of course I've already thrown away the box the new one came
in. 

Any ideas, thoughts, or info sincerely appreciated.
