I think that a combination of slightly lean running, relief valve problems, 
end play and oil type all played a factor here.  Proud to say that all seems 
to be ok now!  Will do the final test tonight.  It seemed fine in the 150 
bazillion degree weather here in hell which some call &quot;Arizona&quot;  Im back on 
the road so watch out!

Also on another note, our clubs website has been redone and it is looking 
good!  We are looking for some good tech articles and some stories or ideas 
for some possible feature so send some in if you like!

Yes, I have a pitchfork!
