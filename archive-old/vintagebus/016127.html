Well, I've personally seen a double-door with hinge covers on
both sides, so there's your drain issue.  Get a set of each, there you have it,
all trimmed up!

I have doubts about the &quot;catching yourself&quot; theory.   But on 'fridge-handled
doors with broken springs, I catch myself in the ribs all the time.  And
THAT smarts!

&gt;     Also, if you try to use &quot;front&quot;cargo hinge covers on the back cargo door
&gt; hinge ,then the drain holes will be on top.. ?!
&gt;     So if Vw. made rear hinge covers the drain holes would be on the
&gt; opposite side...?...
