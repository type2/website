Subject: Camper interior color question?

Hi list,

With all of this talk about camper interiors, I thought would ask and
see if anybody would know what color the camper seat cushions and sling
for a '61 SO23 that was originally Mango green and sea gull grey.  I
can't imagine that it would be the red and black plaid.  Red and green
would be great around Christmas, but look silly the rest of the year.
Could it be this yellow and black plaid?  I got the bus about a month
ago and have been keeping an eye out for anybody with this combo but
with no luck, everybody I've talked to has Beige grey over SWR with the
red and black plaid.  Any Sgg/Mg '61 SO23's out there?  What color is
your interior.

Thanks all,
Aaron
