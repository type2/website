Subject: [VB] need old digests - friday REPEAT REQUEST
Message-ID: &lt;0.75978522.254ad285_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Okay, I hae been a ood lister and waited a whole week until friday to post 
this again.  I still need some old list digests.  Got zero responses last 
time, So, 

Any chance anyone out there archives the digests, like me?  If there is, I 
need the following 1999 vintage bus digests: 

61, 127, 128, 129, 220, 231

A big thanks if you can zip them and send them to me.

'67 Westfalia Campmobile &quot;a Westy&quot; - standin until Poni is finished
'67 hardtop deluxe &quot;Else&quot; - parts for Poni
'74 beater beetle &quot;Red&quot; - rusting and running winter beater

PS.  Sorry about posting the &quot;engine vent trim reproduction&quot; twice.  The list 
server accepted a unsubsribed address (tommygoody_at_aol_dot_com) for some reason.  
I composed the message under one address and sent it accedentially to the 
list (while sending it to my official list address) and the list posted it.  
Don't know why it did this, but again, sorry.
