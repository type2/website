Subject: Re: [VB] 67' Oil Cooler Conversion

What is your question on the oil cooler? How to install the doghouse cooler on
a non-doghouse case? What seals to use? This may help:
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/oilcool.htm

&gt; I am rebuilding an engine for my 67 bus.  The engine I am working with is
&gt; out of a 67 beetle 1500 singleport.  My problem is with the oil cooler.  The
&gt; one off my bus engine is the newer doghouse style.  The one on the bug
&gt; engine is the ole style without the doghouse and of course #3 is going to
&gt; run hot.  Does anyone have any info. on converting this to the newer
&gt; doghouse style or what my options are??
