Subject: No Pain, No Gain!!

It hurts a bit today, but when it's done, I'm sure it will feel much better.

What am I talking about?  Well a few weeks ago I decided to send a double
cab to the body shop to have the rust repaired (I live in the salt belt)
and painted.  Over the phone, my body man who is great with metal
replacement shot me a figure to replace the bad spots then spray a single
stage paint.  But when he looked the truck over, the figure more than
doubled!!

The body man suggested I find a more solid DC, but as you know, those are
not easy to come by.  Well after doing some serious soul searching, I
decided to bite the bullet and let him do the work.  He is going to blast
the truck after cutting out all the bad parts then shoot POR 15 into all
the exposed body cavities, so really the truck should be more solid in the
long run than one that has minor rust where it shows, but surface rust on
the inside just waiting to appear a year or two down the road.

All this talk on the vintage bus list about expensive Harley toys makes me
realize putting money into something you love and can enjoy for years is a
good thing.  And really, with the value of double cabs, I may be better
sinking my money in old German metal than new paper stocks. What the heck,
since I no longer have a trophy wife, I'm going to enjoy my busses and have
them looking and running good.

Maybe I should be more concerned about the problems we are facing, but I
say I'm not going to let fear rule my life, I'm going to enjoy every minute
of it!!

Time to make a list of all the body panels I will need and give Ronnie a call!!
