&lt;&lt;  1.  Very hard to start (cranks good) after running on freeway for 30 min. 
 What might be wrong?&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Definitely sounds like an electrical problem.  From the battery ground strap, 
to the ignition key, to the starter and to the tranny ground strap.  
Somewhere in there!  When the engine is warm it has more compression due to 
the pistons and rings sealing better.  So it takes more electrical juice to 
turn the motor over.
 
&lt;&lt;2.  There is a significant oil leak now (after about an hour on the 
freeway) out from behind the crank pulley.  Is there a seal I can replace 
fairly easily, or is this a sign of a needed rebuild.  I've not checked the 
Bentley, and have never rebuilt a motor.&gt;&gt;
     Do you mean oil is comming out from in front of the lower pulley?  If 
so,do you have the breather hose connected and unplugged?  Have you checked 
to make sure that the valve cover seals are in properly?  On stock type 1-3 
engines there is no seal around the pulley there.  The oil throw threads on 
the lower pulley could be clogged or ruined.

 3.   After the high speed (60 ha ha ha) run when returning to idle the oil 
pressure light is flickering slightly.  After some street driving the low 
pressure warning quits all together.  Another bad sign, or related to the oil 
leak.  &gt;&gt;
  With a mystery motor it really is a good idea to drive in town stop and go 
only for about 20-30 minutes at a time stopping here and there for at least 
15 minutes at a time.  Changing oil about every 50 miles for the first 
300-500 miles.  The engine will most likely be polishing itself back in 
especially the P&amp;C and rings area!  Which means lots of micro and larger 
metal shavings.  Plus the added danger of loosening oil sludge in the engine 
case passages/sump areas which all too often ends up clogging the oil cooler 
or even a bearing.  Out of the last five mystery engines we tried to run, 
four fried due to clogged oil coolers and bearing passageways when just taken 
out on the highway for only an hour or two.  The fifth is still running fine 
years later due to us running it in town and multipule oil changes.  Eric&amp;Barb
