Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse Fan Shroud w/extra 'ring'

It is from a fuel injected beetle.  I was going to use
one on a rebuild I did for a friend, but it did not
work because the accelerator cable tube holes were in
a different place or something.

&gt; I have a doghouse fan shroud with an additional 'ring'
&gt; where the cooling air goes in, similar to a 36hp thermo
&gt; ring - what's the purpose of this?
