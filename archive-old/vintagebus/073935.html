&gt; Are you saying that the 14's on mid 64-67 buses are different than the 14's 
&gt; on 68-70 buses?

Hi Ronnie,
Well we should have said &quot;15&quot; type 2 rims&quot; instead of pre-1968 rims.  Duh!!  
Does look like the modern radial problem is the same for the 1964-1/2 through 
JULY1970 14&quot; type 2 rim.  According to the 1968-78 VW/Bentley &quot;Official 
Service Manual&quot;, the small five 1971 and later rims here in the N. America and 1972 
and later in Europe are 1/2&quot; wider so the radial could be factory equipped on 
the bus.  Previous rims were bias ply equipped.  
  According to &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; in the 1960-1970 edition:
type 1 rim is 4&quot; wide.
15&quot; type 2 rim is 4-1/2&quot; wide.
1964-12 up through JULY 1970 is 5&quot; wide.
