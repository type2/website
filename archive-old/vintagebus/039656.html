hey list

I am now in the final stages (putting the boots on etc) of redoing my RGB's
and putting the axles on a ronnie/rancho trans.

My question is how much up and down movement is permissible on the stub
axles.  If i take the pass side stub axle and gripit in my hand and apply
downward force i can barely feel and see some movement probably (.3mm), but
on driver side I can hear it and it moves probably .7-1mm.

In other words i  moved them like how you do when you check to see if your
bearings are bad in the first place,  but I have no where near the slop i
had before i replaced the bearings.  The old bearings were totally shot.

I am pretty sure that they are together correctly together because an
experienced mechanic helped me andd we used the Bentley, Clymer, and Dave
Easterwood's Neato instructions.

I do not know maybe this is nothing at all but I figured that it would not
hurt to ask.

thanks alot
