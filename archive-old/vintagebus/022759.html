Subject: Re: [VB] Hubcap clips that dont suck?

Dunno if anyone has done this, but when I got my 63 camper there were next
to no hubcap clips remaining...so I ran the risk of buying the crappy repo
ones.  But during this whole time, I was comparing them to the originals.
It appeared to me that the gap in the clip was just too big!  I could
visualise the lip of the hubcap getting caught in there and then ripping it
off when I took the cap off next.  So I got out the vise grips and gave
them all just enough pressue to close that gap up a bit.  I didn't tweak
them down or crush them...just a little push to narrow that gap enough.
Having now used all ten clips I bought and adjusted, I'm pleased to report
that none of them have broken!  My only problem clip is now an OEM one!
