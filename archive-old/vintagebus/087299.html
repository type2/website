&gt; Does anyone have an idea of how many splitties are left in North
&gt; America?

Not sure.  One source I have says that there were about 1.85 million
made worldwide, and about 363,000 of those were exported to the United
States.  The best year for exports to the USA was 1964 at 41,051,
followed by 1966 at 40,198 and 1963 at 39,383.

&gt; 285 showed up at OCTO last month.

OCTO is in California, right?  I suspect that there are more splitties
per capita in California than in most other states, but a quick
extrapolation from California's 36.5 million to the USA's 299 million
(per http://quickfacts.census_dot_gov/qfd/states/06000.html ) for those 285
splitties gives about 2,340.  Probably not all of the ones at OCTO were
from California, which would make the national number even lower.
