&gt; Approximately how much would an unladen single cab weigh, minus engine
&gt; and transmission?
&gt; 
Is there a prize for the best guess?

Let's see.......DMV says unlaiden is 2500 lbs, minus all that stuff that
makes it move forward and backward......I'd say about 1958 lbs.

Santa Cruz, CA

'57 Single Cab (Louise, getting a new bed)
'93 MR2 Turbo (freeway flyer)

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
