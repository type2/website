I have been drving the 63 snglecab around for the last few weeks and am very
happy with the gas mileage. Over 500 miles I am getting 27 miles to the
gallon.
&gt;
Using my photographic VW memory, I recall you have a 40hp engine.  I can
report that both the 40hp I had in a '56 Bug and the current 40hp in my '54
SC get ~40 mpg highway, about 5 mpg lower in the city.  My SC has no
reduction boxes, would they make that big of a difference?

On a side note, I'm glad that the Single Cab is doing well, considering that
when VWs leave my ownership, they seem to spontaneously explode.  Consider
this history of what I thought were reliable daily drivers:
'63 Squareback - Guy blew the tranny driving it home, I suspect he cruised
home in 3rd at 60 mph because he couldn't shift into 4th gear (Don't ask me
why...)
'63 Single Cab (yours) - Guy blew the engine soon after purchase, he blamed
it on the air cleaner breather hose???  Riiiight, it was like that for 6
months...
'65 Squareback (just sold) - Oil light came on when the new owner was
driving it home, he pulled over and parked it but came back later to check
it out.  He started it and it began to run rough and he now reports &quot;some
sort of bolt is sticking up out of the top of the case&quot;  Jeez, I drove it
35-40 miles/day for over 3 months, including the day I sold it to him...

&quot;I can't believe someone cut up a Bus to make it into a Truck.&quot;
&quot;Uh, that's stock.  VW Trucks were available, too.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot;
&quot;Don't worry about it.  A lot of people have never seen one.&quot;
