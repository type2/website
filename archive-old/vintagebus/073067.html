Subject: Re: [VB] She said .. He said

It could be a misaligned rod as mentioned and it could also be a seized or sticking &quot;pin&quot; that the actual pedal is mounted with under the bus. There is a 17-19mm (head size) bolt that runs through a sleeve that is in the frame of your bus. Sometimes that assembly dries out and will cause the pedal to bind up. The Bentley manual has the proceedures for dis-assembly and assembly.
