Subject: solex float valve - [WAS: Carb Question] 

Hi All -
	from andy:
&gt; are you sure you got the float level set?
&gt; they send a soft spacer for the float valve that is no good, i use a brass
&gt; one over and over.
&gt; also, from my experience, the float valves in the kits often leak.
&gt; i keep reusing an old original one.

And a reminder that Berg (and likely others) still sell a heavy duty 
solex float valve that should fit just about any older solex carb, as 
well as Kadron's, for $11.

This is a more sturdy design, using a positive ball-on-float on/off, 
just about guaranteed to put an end to float bowl overfill problems 
and recommended by the offroad types.  I'm still using some 20 yr. old 
ones on my bus.

Nick
