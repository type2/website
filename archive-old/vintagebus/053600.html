I'm thinking that for much less money,you could buy a bus only towbar that
you could keep forever.It sounds like U-haul is a little expensive these
days!

&gt; Michael,
&gt; I've done it both ways, cheapest and easiest is the dolly. If your sure
the
&gt; trans and rear wheels are fine its a good way to go. When we picked up the
&gt; 77 in Oregon it was $55 one way to Victoria. On the down side it was $300
&gt; from Cal to Victoria for the '66. Lesson here is to check the states your
&gt; going through. According to all the Uhaul guys I talked too, anything one
&gt; way out of Cal is real expensive right now. Had I known that, coulda
picked
&gt; up a dolly on the way down and paid $55 again. Did the truck and dual axle
&gt; trailer thing when we moved my dads '61 chev. Its definitely wider and
&gt; heavier than our buses. Pulled it with a Ryder 40' moving truck. Made for
a
&gt; very long rig and for some real slow uphills thru Shasta and Oregon, plus
&gt; like others have mentioned pricey. Mind you we did this in the worst
winter
&gt; on record in the PNW and it pulled fine thru sleet,snow,ice, rain and
wind.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to the MANY encouraging responses and advice I have received from
all
&gt; listees. The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning on using
&gt; (their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope is long enough- has
&gt; someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport) trailer and can vouch
that
&gt; the bus will actually fir on the trailer?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again everyone!!
&gt;
&gt; Michael
