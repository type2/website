&lt;&lt; well my 64 chassis 1302310 has lil nut and at some point since they dont
 seem to be the correct ones, i wouldnt mind trading for a set of big uns.
 someone must have an old unit and want the right stuff to go with it
 right?
 is there any way that they were original?
  &gt;&gt;
it was changed to big nut aug 63 ch 1 144 303, so sounds like at some time 
your tranny went bad and some PO swapped one in from an earlier bus.    Your 
front suspension has teh axle nut covers wit the easy pry off lip?   That is 
64-67 style.   It is a lot of work to swithc the rear axle tubes/ RGBoxes 
over, you know, though , but do find the later stylke and plan when your 
tranny goes to swap over to the 64-67 RGBoxes is my advice.   With time, you 
can wait and find the cheap deal.
