Subject: CE Safaris - Install
Mime-Version: 1.0


I got my CE safaris today.  Took 8 days to get to Sacramento from Jolly Ol'
England.

First impression: they seem to be put together fairly well, but the welds
on the hinge is kinda sketchy - it's not spot welded - and the hinge itself
is very soft metal - I can bend it easily.  Might be an issue, we'll see.

The instructions at first blush look great - color pix even!  But they
gloss over stuff, like the dash tabs.  It's pretty much &quot;figger out where
to put the dash tabs, then move on&quot;

The windshield mounts are nice and sturdy, but the press-in thread collar
had some interference with the wing nut.  

I screwed up the first weld by forgetting to turn the MIG gas on - d'oh!

The seals are different than what I'd seen before; a crimp-type part for
the frame, and a curved lip toward the frame.  Hmmmm.

The only real problem is the inner dash tabs - the latch hits the screw
when you try to close it, and if I remove the screw, it hits the tab.
Hmmm.  I've fired an email off to CE to see what up.
