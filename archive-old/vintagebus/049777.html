I'm pretty sure the cab/dash of every panel was white, the cargo bay was
flat gray.

You really should subscribe to the vintagebus list as they have the world's
masters there for this sort of vintage/resto thing. (Er, and world's
mastresses, sorry Clara! =^)

&gt;Hello there,
&gt;   I have just recently purchase my first panel van.  A 1962 and the
&gt;original owner pianted it, for some odd reason with tremclad.  I was
&gt;wondering what the original colour of the cargo area is?  the original
&gt;colour is white but I need to know was the cargo area a different colour
&gt;and is the dash, doors, and driver's area the same as the exterior?
&gt;   This would be a big help for me because I am in the middle of a full
&gt;restoration.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank You
