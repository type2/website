I asked for advice a few weeks ago regarding my '66 6V bus that 
won't start.  Thanks to the folks who gave me some valuable 
pointers, most of which suggested a bad connection somewhere in 
the starter circuit.  This is the vehicle that I parked in the 
garage last winter, running fine, but it wouldn't start about 3 
weeks later, even after charging the battery and later replacing 
the battery.

Unfortunately, I've gone over everything closely and it still 
won't start.  Used a voltmeter, used jump cables to bypass 
potential bad places, but still won't start.  Battery, positive 
cable, negative cable, and starter are all new (starter is a 
factory rebuilt 6V Bosch model SR11X).  All connections are 
immaculate. They're all new; nothing corroded. I even ran a jump 
cable from the battery negative post around to the body of the 
starter (even though the starter and transmission tested as 
being grounded well), but still no go.

2 questions:

1) The engine turns over just great by hand (turning the 
generator pulley). Just as easy as always. Sure, you can feel 
when a piston is at the top of a compression stroke, but you 
still can manually turn it over and over, just as on my '70 
beetle, which starts great. Can the engine still have some 
internal problem so that a high torque electric motor, which is 
supposed to turn it many, many times faster, cannot turn it over 
at all (or only very slowly)?  Something binding or seized up 
that my weakling arm can't even feel but that a high torque 
electric motor can't handle?  (I can't imagine so, but am 
interested in others' opinions.)

2) The starter worked great before I reinstalled the engine. 
Gear popped out and it spun fast.  Running off the battery, 
using the stock ignition circuit.  Could the starter still be a 
bad part from the factory so that when a load is put on it 
(i.e., when the engine is back in) it can barely move the 
flywheel and then just burn out (even though I didn't try 
cranking it over 15 sec. at a time)?

Yes, the starter seemed to have burned out from this ordeal. I 
took it back out of the car (a bear to do with the engine in--I 
had to remove the right rear brake line), and hooked it up to a 
6V source. The gear pops out, but it doesn't turn anymore!

Incidently, when trying to get the starter to turn, a voltmeter 
hooked between the + and - battery terminals would read 6V. When 
the starter was turned on (but wasn't working), this dropped to 
next to nothing.  A guy in a electrical shop told me this 
indicates the starter is bad.

I suspect I'll encounter an incredible hassle if I try to turn 
this back in for a replacement (1-year warranty). They'll say it 
was broken by my engine being seized up, or something (that's 
why I asked question #1, above).  I got it mail order from some 
place that apparently doesn't even stock what they sell; I found 
out afterwards that they're just brokers who find some supplier 
to ship it to me from some completely different place.

A couple of people mentioned the possiblity of thick oil. It's 
20W-50 weight.  It's nice and drippy on the dipstick. It didn't 
turn over even in 90 degree weather in the summer.  And the 
engine doesn't seem to drag when turning it over manually.  See 
my question #1 above.  I'd have to hear a pretty good story to 
be convinced that this oil causes this extreme of a problem.

Someone also mentioned the starter switch bypass relay, that 
gives the solonoid a more direct source of juice rather than 
relying on that circuit that goes up the the front, through a 
bunch of push-on connectors, and back again. They thought maybe 
this was enough of a draw to cause a problem.  But the solonoid 
kicks in OK, it's the starter that doesn't turn or can't turn 
the engine.  I think the relay draws a minute amperage. The 
starter gets it's current directly from the battery through the 
big heavy cable to the solonoid; it doesn't go through this 
switch. In any case, just to be sure, I disconnected the relay 
and returned to the stock circuit. No effect. Same failure 
either way.

Any more advice is appreciated.

thanks,
	Mark
