Subject: Re: 1641...What dizzy?
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 1998 22:41:52 PDT


&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;Just wondering what dizzy my 1600 should have.  I'd like to have the
&gt;vacuum advance distributor put back on, but I'm not sure what # it
&gt;should be.  This motor is for my 65.  I remember someone mentioning 
that
&gt;Jim Thompson put up a list of these, anyone remember the URL??  Thanks
&gt;

------------------
I like my 009. I have used them for nearly every engine I have run. I 
have a big ol pile of other dizzy's and I have tried various ones out 
but nothing seems as smooth and nice as the 009's have. I suppose I 
should point out that no matter what engine I have driven, 1500 to 1641, 
I use single port heads (for durability), stock to mild exhaust, and 
Solex 30/31's. I don't use solex 34's EVER. I also always use electronic 
ignition, usually pertronix (older ones). I time all engines by total 
advance, never static as well. The 009 has a smooth curve, and works 
well for me. I welcome comments about other set ups, and might even be 
willing to retry my other dist's and give comments about them. I always 
have been one to try out different ideas because there never seems to be 
one setup that works for everybody.
