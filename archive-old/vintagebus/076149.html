Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance -Good luck

&gt;State Farm screwed me too

They all suck. Most of the companies ultimately end up with their 
money coming from the same place anyway.

They all had big money invested in the stock market before our 
current disaster of an economy. When the bottom fell out they lost it 
big time. That's why they used things like &quot;black mold&quot; and 
&quot;terrorism&quot; as excuses for raising insurance costs. Basically any 
excuse they can come up with.

Get smart folks. Self insure if at all possible. Stuff the money you 
pay insurance companies away and you'll be surprised how quick you 
end up with the replacement cost for your bus or whatever. You play 
the odds, but at least you know where you stand. And all the money 
you put in is there if you never use it.

If your state requires liability coverage then get the absolute 
cheapest you can find.

No offense to any insurance agents....but the system is crooked as 
hell...but what's new now adays.

Sell your sh*t and move to the country. Make sure and take some guns 
with you to stash in your cabin.
