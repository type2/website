Great site, Wade!  One minor comment, though: it almost implies that the
last dropgate VW truck rolled off the assembly line in 1967. Might I suggest
throwing up a few BaywindowVanagon/Eurovan truck references/pics - even if
only to acknowledge the nearly 40 year staying power of the dropgate
Volkswagen truck, which is quite something considering that most people in
the U.S. don't know they even existed at all, and even fewer know that
they're still made today!  I'm sure members of type2_dot_com and vanagon_dot_com
would be happy to assist with pics or info if asked.

The blasphemous opinion of an equal-opportunity Volkswagen driver ...
