I keep thinking of the 'South Park' episode called
'Tom's Rhinoplasty'.  Are you putting carpet in your
bus Ken?

Anyway:

On Pandora, cut approximately 20mm (3/4 inch?)
in from the side and bottom seams.  Best tool for
me is a 4 inch angle grinder with a cutting disc 
(wots a sawzall?).  You do have to go gently to
avoid cutting or slicing any structures behind
the nose skin (particularly along the bottom!).
Remember the nose skin is 1mm thick and that's
all you have to cut.  For the top cut, cut as high
as you need to replace the damaged panel.
However, look inside and avoid placing your
top cut so that it is 'hidden' by the structural
member (that the under dash tray bolts to).
Easier if you can manage to cut lower than this
member, but not essential.

On donor bus cut 'hard up' against the seams
so that you hopefully get a section with a edge
gap of 1mm or so when you place it against Pandora.

The nose skin is not structural and I would
normally butt weld it.  However, for the newer 
metal worker/fitter and MIG welder, flange fitting is best
because 'backing' metal can hide less than
*absolutely perfect* fitting gaps and help stop
blowing holes.  Flange the side and bottom
lip that you've left on Pandora and take some 
time fitting and trimming
the donor skin.  But it is difficult (impossible)
to flange the top cut because you can't neatly
flange the compound section of the nose 'V'
without creasing or ruining it.  The top must
be butt welded, but if you end up with 
a gap through slight misfitting or are worried
about butt welding, back the join with neatly 
cut strip(s) of 0.8 to 1mm thick sheet welded to 
the inside of the panel where you made the top cut.

&gt; Question for the experienced: if you have your choice, where is the best
&gt; line to take the nose? I'll probably do this with an abrasive wheel in a
&gt; Skil saw. My neighbor has a Sawzall if that is preferable but when I've
&gt; used the wheel in the Skil I've liked it.
&gt; 
&gt; Having got the nose, is it best to flange the bus, or try to cut
&gt; accurately
&gt; and butt-weld it instead? Joe has a 110-volt MIG but we don't know what
&gt; we're doing.
