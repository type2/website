Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum case update deluxe LONG

I hate to say this but now that the engine is making noise, it's time to
tear it down.  You might be able to save a lot of money if you do it now.
If something is making that noise, it's got to be hitting something, and
that should make a dent/scratch/metal shavings somewhere.  I would tear it
down just to see.  That way you KNOW it's not the rod bolts, or the lifters,
or whatever.

&gt; &gt;of modifications and tolerances. ( Refer to Ray Heath's sig line:)
