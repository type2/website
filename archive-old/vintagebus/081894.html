Subject: can you help

hello from cold UK
maybe you can help..I am nearing completion of a new book which documents all the various camper conversions 1951 thru to T5 (well maybe not all post 1980! but a fair few) - specs models interior fittings and layouts etc..
I'm trying to find some pics of interiors of pre 56 westies to go with the text and brochure materials - even if just views of side with load doors open...
maybe you know someone who has a few pics or maybe you have a couple? or maybe you could post a measage on the forum for me asking folks? I know there are not many around so am not holsing my breath but maybe just maybe?
you may know my last book on the Split screen Bus Specs? or maybe you know the magazine I edit www.volkswagencamper.co_dot_uk 
any help much appreciated
David Eccles
