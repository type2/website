Subject: towing questions

hey list,

Does anyone know of the best way to set up a tow hitch on my 64' Is there
anyone who makes hitches allready or will I have to hire a metal fabricator
for the work.  I'd really like to travel a bit with a 16' catamaran in tow.
Total weight is about 300 for the boat, who knows how much the trailer
weighs.  No more than 500 lbs all together I imagine.
If all works out, Ill be bringing it to Busses by the Sea for some canoeing
and day sailing adventures!! :)
