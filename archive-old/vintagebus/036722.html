Hi list,

Was wondering if anyone has tried the contact details I posted for the merc
truck headlights from South Africa?

If you require any help or advice about shipping goods out of a third world
backwater please feel free to pmail me ;-). I am very happy to collect the
parts from the dealer so that a freight service can pick them up. That way I
could confirm the layout of adjusting screws and make sure that they were
adequately packaged. The comments that I made about not doing it as a
business and not working to a schedule prolly sounded a bit harsh - the
dealership in question is a 15 miniute drive from the office and both DHL
and Fedex make three or four stops a week at my company so collecting,
checking and repacking the stuff really wouldn't present a problem.

BTW the owner of the farm on which the possible barndoor that I posted about
may have found out that he is sitting on something good. I have called him 5
times to make a new arrangement and he is being all coy and evasive. He
originally told my friend who discovered the thing that we could haul it
away as long as we cleared the shed that it is sitting in. Now he doesn't
seem nearly as eager. Bugger, I hope that some well meaning idiot hasn't
gone and filled his head with ideas about parting some bus lover from a heap
of cash.

Later 

Michael
