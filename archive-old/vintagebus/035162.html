&lt;&lt; &gt;- plugged-up fuel sock in tank
 What is this? &gt;&gt;

Over the years, you know how you keep missing all those left socks? Well, 
this is where they end up.

But seriously folks, inside the tank there is a mesh (copper I think) 
strainer that covers the fuel outlet. It looks like a miniature tube sock. It 
is possible that if it is still intact that it could be clogged up.

Hope this helps,
