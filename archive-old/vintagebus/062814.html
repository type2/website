  Go to www.vintagebus_dot_com and look at the wiring diagrams so nicely posted
there for your help. This should eliminate any questions you should have.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wires- well the black wire goes to the 15 on the coil - this one goes 
&gt; hot
&gt; when you turn the key on
&gt;
&gt; The green one plugs into the oil sender- if a friend turns the key on, 
&gt; and
&gt; you ground this wire, the oil light comes on on the dash
&gt;
&gt; If you ground the power wire for the coil with ig on, you'll blow a 
&gt; fuse.
&gt; sometimes someone has spliced a differenet colour wire on there.
&gt;
&gt;
well...my wiring is like this

theres a red and a blue coming from way behind the engine compartment 
(from the inside of the bus), one from the fuel tank, nothing from the 
voltage regulator (except whats hooked up to the starter) and theres one 
black screw on thats coming from the left brake light. and what the hell 
is a coil and where is it. (i have the muir book so everyone needs to 
stop telling me to buy it, just because i dont understand mechanical 
books the first 10 times i read them doesnt mean i didnt read, it, it 
justt makes me incompitant....and it proovs throo mi speleng)
