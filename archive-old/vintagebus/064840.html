&gt; The case has a black finish, I'll call it oxide but at any rate the
&gt; engine ID located by the generator base is no longer there.

Hmm, did someone paint the case with black &quot;crinkle paint&quot;?  It might be
that the number is under a layer of paint.

Alternately, there may be no number at all if the case or engine was
replaced.  My Mexican engines have no numbers.

Other cluess:  single/dual port?  Doghouse tin?  dates in heads?  If it's
a late model dual port it is probably a 1600.
