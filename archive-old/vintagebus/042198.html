&gt; In California, ya gotta have windshields, although it doesn't say they have to be closed!

&gt; 
&gt; 26700.  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a passenger vehicle, other than a
&gt; motorcycle, and every bus, motortruck or truck tractor, and every firetruck, fire engine or
&gt; other fire apparatus, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be equipped with an
&gt; adequate windshield. 
&gt; 
&gt; (b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to any vehicle issued identification
plates pursuant to
&gt; Section 5004 which was not required to be equipped with a windshield at
the time it was
&gt; first sold or registered under the laws of this state, another state,
or foreign jurisdiction. 

Herein lies the loophole!  If the vehicle was not required to have a
windshield when it was first sold, in the place where it was first sold,
you're off the hook.  If you're importing a barndoor from Botswana you
might be able to drive about with safaris fully open.

Good luck convincing Officer Friendly of that, though!  :)
