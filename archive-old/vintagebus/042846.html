Jason scrawled:

   RMMW lists them as:
    &quot;211 501 249, Plug, Gear Reduction Housing, L or R, '64-'67 type II,
$4.95 ea....&quot;
    1-800-258-1996 is their #.
    you were looking for *plugs*, but no affiliation whatsoever.... :)

These plugs are plastic, not the metal ones.  The metal ones are
expensive.  I just put the plastic ones on and they seem to be ok since
they hide behind the spring plate for protection. RTV them good before
installation.

Best,
