Try to open the case up, carefully, clean all the gears and put back

Hi Kevin,
Hopefully you also put in new lithium grease to fill about 1/3-1/2 of the 
gear box.  Any thicker grease or packing the gearbox full will make the wiper 
motor struggle.  BTDT!  We have been wondering about using white lithium grease 
which is far more thinner/lighter.
  Do watch out for the small warpy washer against the large gear so you can 
save it and install it back where it belongs in the gearbox.
