Subject: ID'ing early bus doors

Good evening all. I just got back from rummaging through a friend of mines
back yard and happened upon a complete set of doors for an early bus in like
mint condition. Both front doors, cargo doors, rear hatch and deck lid. Is
there any way to determine the year of these? They had like pull-type
handles if that helps and it wasn't  a barn door. Does anyone know the value
of aforementioned doors? Does anyone need these? Thanks again!
