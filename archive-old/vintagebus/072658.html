Subject: Re: [VB] Oregon Questions

We are looking at 10-14 days. Oregon is still up in the air as we might have to find a quicker route back to the Bay Area in order to stay employed!
 
It took us about 16 hours to get to Jerome from my house and after that the drive should be a lot more enjoyable. 
 
I am shopping around now for a new trans as we speak!
