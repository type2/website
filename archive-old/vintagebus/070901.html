Subject: Re: [VB] Reely Stoopid Oil Question

&gt; You don't spill, but you get
&gt; the disadvantage of something else to keep clean.


Yep, that's why I dislike using funnels....more drip somewhere else, and/or
more rags being slimy.

Actually, Raymond's suggestion of a clogged baffle seems like a possibility.
I dunno...the rest of the engine is fairly clean, but it sure seems like
this one has a harder time accepting oil than the others.

Maybe the baffle is on backwards?
