I also heard of a &quot;harpoon&quot; device that was being tested, where they'd
fire a harpoon into your car and drag you to a stop.  Would be kinda interesting
if the perp's car was heavier/faster than the cop's car.  That would
make for a hilarious chase scene.

Or you have the cop car hidden on the side of the road, when the white 930
rips by at triple digits.  Officer Ahab, with a mouth full of Kripy Kreme, reaches
for the key as he yells &quot;Thar she blows!&quot;

 &lt;&lt; Just heard of new law enforcement technology that can shut off a car's 
 fuel supply from a pursuit vehicle. No details yet, but probably only works 
 on newer cars. Another reason to drive an old VW bus.  &gt;&gt;
