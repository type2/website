Subject: Distributor-odd #, can't find

First of all, thanks to everyone who pointed me to the old Volks home site.
However, the model I have,
111 905 205T
0 231 137 029 (Bosch #)
I can't find listed anywhere. I was told it came off a 1600 Single Port,
and was working at the time.
Any of you folks with parts books got that one listed?
Also, does it matter which vacuum port I hook it up to?
thanks again,
