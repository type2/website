Hi Walt,
While I fully support that you can paint your own bus any color you darn
well please...if you're planning on selling the bus quickly, you might want
to consider going with a stock color. When I see buses for sale that are
freshly painted and custom colors, I wonder how much of the price is in the
paint job that I don't really want. You could save that paint for the bus
you really want. Just a thought...meant to be helpful!

I second what Scott said.     You might really like Candy Apple Red, but I 
cringed when I read that, and it could turn potential buyers off.    For some 
 reason I keep getting compliments on my westy I painted about 3 years ago- 
velvet green/blue white.    It's easy to look at.   Even people who have must 
have seen it drive it around town for the last few years.  Then they ask me 
when I will paint my window frames for the cab doors and proceed to point out 
their nicely done one with new seals.  sigh.   There's that bright pink and 
grey bug on the way downtown that has had a for sale sign on it for about a 
year I think.

Clara
