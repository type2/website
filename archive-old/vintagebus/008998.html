Another suggestion to the hot water in getting the rubber strips pliable is
the use of a paint stripper gun. I have used this numerous times when heat
is required to eliminate the normal tussle with &quot;cold&quot; parts. Check the heat
continually by using  your fingers as the temperature sensor and you can
also tell the &quot;heat&quot; by the color or shine and smell of the rubbber as you
work it. Smoke, of course is a bad sign! It works, have never burned my
fingers, or anything else for that matter... give it a try

&gt; Are there any tip's out there for installing the
&gt; rubber trim in the aluminum on the bumpers.  I have
&gt; tried prying it and using WD-40 to lub it.  any
&gt; methods to this that anyone can share?
&gt;
&gt; I have not had any luck yet.
&gt;
&gt; How did you soften up the rubber?
&gt; Where to pry?
&gt; What end to start on?
&gt; How long should i expect to take to do them?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Matt
