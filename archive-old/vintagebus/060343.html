Subject: Re: [VB] powdercoating pop out window frames

Don't know what chickens like on AM radio,
but this powdercoat problem also affects
road wheels, where the center joins the rim.
The crevice is a steep angle which repels material.
Just another technical marble.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The difficulty encountered when powdercoating pop-out window frames
&gt; &gt;involves the Faraday Cage Effect, wherein the charged powder is repelled
&gt; &gt;from reflecting surfaces.
&gt;
&gt; I thought the Faraday cage effect had to do with an AM radio not
&gt; working when your physics teacher takes it inside a grounded
&gt; chicken-wire telephone booth.  :)
&gt; http://www.powdercoating_dot_org/industry/faq.htm seems to indicate that
&gt; the problem is with recessed areas, not reflective surfaces.  This
&gt; makes a little more sense to me.  The net effect is the same as you
&gt; mentioned, though - it's hard to get the powder into the channels.
