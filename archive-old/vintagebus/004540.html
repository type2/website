It looks like AAA is the cheapest source for now. Problem is they charge
extra $200.00 for non-driveable vehicles. That boosts the price to: $695.00.
Well, talked to my friend, trucker. He says that possibility that some
private trucker will be able to haul a car or a van is very slim. Loading,
unloading problems you know. I'll still keep digging.
