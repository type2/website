Subject: update - Tom Good in Vermont
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Split List, 

It has been a long time :-(  

I have been on self imposed exile until I finally got around to updating my 
web site. Besides my crazy project (second in line to the &quot;body off&quot; guy in 
Europe for insanity (yes I challenge you to best this lunacy)) I posted:

1 - pitures of Kelley Park 2000 (yeap I made it, but couldn't stay long - saw 
Ronnie, VW Howard and some of you others, but missed Thom)

2 - pictures of my bus rotisserie

3 - the results of the chemical rust treatments that I was supposed to post 
like 2 years ago. 

4 - pictures of my previous busses and some crazy paint jobs.

5 - pictures of junkyards

Now just because its been a long time, don't think that I have been spending 
it all on web design, you will be dissapointed.  I would like to know if the 
rust results are too confusing. 

I am far behind on reading the list (720 digests to be exact), so I am just 
going to jump in here at digest 400 and try to hold on.  I really don't see 
how some of you do it, but its good to be back.  I missed the list.
