Subject: Generator/Alt fuel pump swap.  Was 6v -&gt; 12v

&gt;Caution here, if you change to an alternator, you will have to change the
fuel pump as well to the alternator type. Or as I did, a &gt;block off plate
and an electric fuel pump which is less expensive.

Just a word of advice here.  Although it's easier and correct to switch from
a generator stand fuel pump to the alternator type, you CAN make a generator
fuel pump fit on an alternator equipped 1600DP engine.  I know - I've done
it.  It requires some patience with a ball been hammer to slightly indent
the top of the fuel pump to clear.  I'm sure many people would frown on this
but if you are tight on cash, you can make them work just fine.  It just
decreases the volume of the top of the pump somewhat.  If you decide to so
this, make sure you indent the cover enough to complete clear the stand -
you do not want metal to metal contact due to the possibilty of wear thru
and a resultant gas leak.

I would still suggest switching to the alternator fuel pump but when you're
tight on cash, well you gotta do these tricks occasionally.
