&gt;the cable
&gt;is exposed and it also is rubbing against the tranny.  It looks like it has
&gt;been this way for some time, as the cable has sliced a nice groove into the
&gt;tranny case.

This is a good question.  Each of the three buses I have owned showed the
same problem.  At one point I slipped a length of steel, brake line tubing
over the cable to shield the tranny at the place where the cable had worn a
slot into the side.  Sometimes the cable would bind in that slot so this was
a functional problem as well.  I didn't anchor the tubing to anything and
just let it find it's own position.  This would be the lowest point along
the cable so make the tube long enough to protect the worn area.  It will be
interesting to see how others have handled this problem.
