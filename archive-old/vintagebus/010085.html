Don't know about a Type 2-specific rooftop tent, but these things have been
around for a long time.  Clear back in the '50s they'd be on display at the
local Fair, in models to fit everything from coupes to humongous carryalls.

I believe Campmor still had them in their catalog a few years back.

I've never slept in one, but I expect it would be pretty entertaining on top
of a VW bus in a stiff breeze.  Heading for the sanitation facility in the
middle of the night could be particularly exciting, especially if you forgot
just where you were :)

&lt;&lt; Have any of you ever heard of or seen this tent?  The ad says to get the
&quot;upstairs&quot; option, you have to get the &quot;Super De Lux&quot; kit. &gt;&gt;
