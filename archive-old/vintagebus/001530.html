Today I needed to pick up some die grinder wheels before working on the T4
oil cooler conversion so as I was headed out to the local farmer hangout, I
spied a discount tool guy setup on the side of the road.  This guy drives a
big converted Ryder truck and lives about 90 miles from here.  I stopped and
bought some tools from him one day in Falls City, NE on my way to the
Hiawatha, KS.  It was at the time that I suggested he swing through Beatrice
to peddle his warez and I told him about a place where the city lets vendors
set up right along the main highway.  Well here he was, set up right where I
had told him 2 years ago!

I walked up to him and said, &quot;About time you get here (smiling.)&quot;  He
remembered me!  We shook hands and slung the breeze for a bit and I then
showed him my die grinder for which I needed some wheels for.  He said he
had some so I bought the last 7 wheels he had which were marked $.99 each.
He sold me all of them for $5 - not a bad deal.  I also picked up a welder's
magnetic square and some grinding wheels for my Makita grinder.  Bought all
this stuff for $17 so not a bad day at all!

Tonight I went to town on the fan shroud and almost got to the point where I
can start welding the extension back on to the shroud.  I need to cut a
little 1.5&quot; piece of metal and weld it down there around where the spring
for the cooling flaps hooks on to but aside from that everything is looking
pretty good for a dumbass in overalls. :-)

I do have a question that I hope someone can answer for me.  Does the
exhaust from the oil cooler have to be enlarged to handle the whole flow of
air?  I can open up the oil cooler exhaust pipe to accomodate the larger
passageway formed before it but doing so won't really create a larger
opening  for the hot air to escape.  Does the whole exhaust have to be
enlarged?  I'd appreciate some feedback on this.

Thanks for reading and I'll post some pictures on the net after the film is
developed.
