 &lt;&lt; You know, that picture doesn't show the kit all too well.  Can you show 
 another view or two?

 Are you kidding?
 Theres like 100 pictures!
 B.T.W., the interior is located in Los Angeles.
  &gt;&gt;
oh, sorry, I found them.  That interior is like the one Cameron has in his 
57? or is it 58?  that was deemed too rusty and to be parted out in Port 
Orchard, and there were some extra pieces of it there too, but what a wierd 
kit.
