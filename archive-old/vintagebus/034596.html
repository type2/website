 I agree with ya.  Even with NOS parts, there are sometimes fit
 issues; why?  Because the dies to make the stampings wore over time,
 so a piece made at one point in time would be slightly different than a
 piece made two years later.  Look at some of the stampings that are
 identical for a large range of buses, and if you have the luck of
 ever having used such a piece, you might see a fitment issue.  I installed
 an NOS 1/4 panel on my '54, and definitely saw spots where it wasn't
 *perfect*, but I had a Schofield panel to compare it against, and it
 was defintiely better.

not only that, but I have noticed that our beautiful buses were not put 
together perfectly.  paint has orange peel and drips etc.  The 54 barndoor 
that drove off to utah never to be seen agin ? had definately gaps and bumps 
where panels were welded together, wish I had taken pictures.
