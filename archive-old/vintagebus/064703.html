Hi Dre,
Well, fix them now not later!  You are ripe for a fuel fire.  The engine is 
getting dirt in it, and running 30F hotter due to these mighty engineering 
screw ups by the DPO.

&gt;&gt;1500? I was told this is a 1600.... I need to get dirty... &lt;&lt;

Looks like you have stale air 40HP rear engine tin since there is no fresh 
air tube holes through.  Of course this had to be cut to fit the 1500 and 
later engine (IDed by the intake manifold pipes where it seals to the heads.) 
you have.  Of course you could have anything from a 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 
1641,1688, or even a 1776cc engine depending on stroke of crank and piston 
size.
