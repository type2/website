Only one object, but it contains several items.

The VW bus tool kit, wrapped in the original interior vinyl
tool wrap.  Everything else on the bus has changed
color, how this remained intact &amp; original is beyond me.
It is the same color as the bus was built per the M-codes.

As for the parcel tray, it also has but one object,
the original owners manual.

After I start driving it, all bets are off.
