Well I'm happy to say that Barrett Enterprises has come thru lock, stock,
and barrel.  A week ago Sunday, I called Barrett's and left word with one of
the employees as to what size my existing worn valve guide O.D.'s were.  All
were the same except for one which was oversized.  I figure I'd give them a
good 2 weeks with the xmas holiday delays and all that goes with it.

Yesterday, I was pleased to see the check for $50 that Ron Barrett sent to
me which pretty much covered the shipping cost for the cores.  Then today I
was happy to see a box sitting in the breezeway from Barrett's.  Inside were
the NEW set of lifters, valves, and guides.

So I think that Ron Barrett has done more than an excellent job in taking
care of this situation.  I would personally suggest that Barrett's quit
dealing with GEX heads - I've heard enough horror stories about GEX and now
witnessed it for myself that their version of a rebuilt head is to check to
see if specs are met with used parts.  Basically this means not replacing
anything unless it's grossly out of what is obviously THEIR specs.  Ron
knows what I think of GEX heads.

The only thing left now is to see if Barrett's comes thru in good time with
the credit to my VISA for the core parts and the piston and cylinder set
which I didn't even open.  I'm going to keep in touch with Barrett's and let
them know what I think of how they took care of this situation - they did
more than enough IMHO.  I still think GEX should have their corporate heads
placed on the proverbial chopping block for churning out junk - they're the
real pricks in this whole fiasco.  And they could really do without the
silver spray paint. :-(

As soon as the bearings show up, it will be &quot;let the engine rebuild begin&quot;
time.  I am starting to feel a little better about this whole thing but
man - a 6 week delay - what a blow...
