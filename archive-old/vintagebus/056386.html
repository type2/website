Hi Steve,
Can you offer a link or a web address for the T3 list?

Thanks,
Ed

&gt; I know a guy that does this. He is on the T3 list, has a stash ot used
parts
&gt; and has sources for new Bosch replacement parts. He rebuilds them in his
&gt; spare time. He also sells parts. He probably has a couple of cans for your
&gt; FI dizzys.

&gt; &gt; &gt;VW did put mech advance in the T3 with FI. It was a combined mech
advance
&gt; &gt; &gt;and vacuum advance.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Steve Bradley
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  well, that's kind of cheating... it still has a vac can on it, so not
&gt; true
&gt; &gt; mech-only.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; this is the T3 dizzy with the little black socket on the side, right?
that
&gt; &gt; is actually my favorite distributor, but AGAIN, the 2 i have no longer
&gt; &gt; function properly - vac cans died.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; any vendors on the list seeing an opportunity here?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; repopping the various vac cans and rebuilt dizzys seems to be in need.
