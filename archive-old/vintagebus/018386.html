No, don't go there...

Seeking old Lenti contact...
I am trying to reconnect with a fella whom I think was
named Johnson who took an employment contract in
Argentina/Chile some where in South America several
years ago and then moved to Denmark. Also had an Eriba
trailer at last contact. The trailer's model was a
larger cousin to the Puck. This person did me a favor
and now its pay back time.
Please contact Jim Ellis
Thanks.
