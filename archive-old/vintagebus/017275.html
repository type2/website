Could someone explain the use of these lights to me please? Are these to be
used in lieu of your regular tail light lamp? or in addition to?

Can they be used on a '65, 6 volt?

I just added an additional ground to the driver side tailight(thanks to help
from the list), seemed to improve the brightness considerably. Are you all now
saying to switch to the LED lamp?

thanks
kevin
