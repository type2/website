Subject: Re: [VB] Speaking of Oil...

&gt;&gt; So I  find myself with a lot of 20W-50 oil.
&gt;&gt; What's everyones opinion on  running this weight oil?
&gt;
&gt; Use it for the air cleaner only then!  Multiwieght oil breaks down in hot 
&gt; VW engine into the lower wieght listed.
&gt;
At what temperature?

I've used 20/50 during the AZ summer and have had no problems.  On older 
engines where the engine light would come on at idle after a highway cruise 
with straight 30wt, the 20/50 would leave the oil light off, which indicates 
to me a higher oil pressure at idle.  I have seen oil temperatures as high 
as 230F with no trouble.

&gt; So we use 10/30 Wt during  cool/cold seasons here and when temps are going 
&gt; to be staying well above 50F we  change over to 30 Wt..  We did try 20/50 
&gt; Castrol and found the oil pressure  in cool weather was so high at start 
&gt; up that the oil cooler was at risk of  swelling or even blowing up.
&gt;
What was the pressure?  I've started up my 36hp Bus at 30-35F with 20/50 
many times with no problems.  A lighter 10/30 would be better at colder 
temperatures...
