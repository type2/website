  Still haven't seen or heard from the Buskatour or Britt. I haven't been
down to the show site yet to see if they ended up there.  There were a few
buses that arrived last night and we had the registration bag stuffing
party. Terry, p-mail me your address (e-mail) and I will send you the pics
from last night) and I haven't forgot you just been very busy as you can
imagine. There are busavans leaving from all over Cali and Az. as I type and
will keep the Buskapeople who couldn't make it as updated as we can so you
can feel like your here.

Ronnie   who ya

ps. buskatour comes up as Buckaroo with spell check!
