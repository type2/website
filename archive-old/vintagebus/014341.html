just had to right a quick note of this weekends goodies.my wife gave me a 
header and a stinger for my early xmas present so i installed it 
yesturday.sounds great.i also finally got a factory third seat on saturday 
and installed that.so me and the family all got to ride in YERTLE THE TURTLE 
  today.my boys loved it and i enjoyed finally being able to ride around 
with the family in the bus.i finally get the bus where the whole family can 
ride in it and it rained all weekend,but it didnt stop us.we put on about 
400 miles on the bus between satury evening and sunday.and we all loved 
every minute.but now my wife wants to find a crewcab if i can acually find 
someone to trade one for my bus that is.so loves the bus but she is a 
countrygirl and likes the crewcab more than the busses.maybe one 
day,lol.well thanx for hearing me glot i have renued fate in my project now 
that the family can enjoy it with me now.

later all
