I am now.  C'mon over and try and collect them; I need some &quot;fill&quot; for
the back yard :)

I aquired a bunch of crates a few years ago from a guy locally known as
&quot;Bondo Bob&quot;.  He pulls up to my house one day and sez &quot;I've got a bunch
of VW parts; if you want 'em, come get 'em, otherwise I'll throw 'em out.&quot;

So I trucked on down there in the '56, and he takes me to The Stash: 
milk crates full of parts all along the fence in his back yard.  I immediately
started poking thru them, and he says &quot;Nope, you either take everything
or nothing at all.&quot;   He was nice enough to help me load everything up;
it took 3 trips with the bus piled with milk crates up to the windows,
along with a bunch of stuff that didn't fit into crates, like
'vert decklids and bug fenders.  Each trip the bus was bogged down on 
the axles. 

A lot of the stuff was pure junk; broken cranks, used pistons and
cylinders, random chunks of metal, mangled engine tin.  A bunch of 914 stuff.
I filled up the county trash can in about 30 minutes, and it took
two people to haul it to the curb; I woulda loved to see the expression
on the guy's face when he went to dump it - it had to weight 500 pounds!

I did get a lot of good stuff from that haul, including the siren that's on
the bus right now. 

And I got to keep the milk crates, of course.  I must have had almost 100
of them; their population has dwindled over the years, as one by one they've
left the nest to take residence at friend's houses, or I cut thru them
when using them as sawhorses...

&gt; While looking at your pictures I noticed your use of Milk Crates, you
&gt; should note that on these it states &quot;Use by other than registered owner
&gt; punishable by law.&quot;
&gt; This is to confirm you are the registered owner? :-)
