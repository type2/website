I just got a 66 deluxe for parts.  I'll be putting some stuff up as i get it
off the body...  Nice white steering wheel, perfect jailbars and so on.  Its
stuff I dont need.  

Anyway, on the rearview mirror there is a flip down smoked plastic cover for
those nasty highbeams in the mirror.  Ive never seen this before and this
thing is in excellent shape.  Is this a rare accesory, and whats its value
you think? the mirror and shade are in great shape.
