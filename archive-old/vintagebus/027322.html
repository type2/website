Subject: Kelly Park

I'm assuming we're back online, so I'll post this again. Sorry if
it goes through twice........

I was talking with another list member a few days ago about Kelly
Park and it occurred to me that alot of us VB list members will
be in attendance. So......................I was thinking we
should set a time/location at the show to meet up and put faces
with names, etc.

Anyone have any ideas?????
