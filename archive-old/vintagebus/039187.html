Message-ID: &lt;DPLBCECCKJOBBAAA_at_ivillage_dot_com&gt;

Hi there everybody out in bus land.
I am looking for a driver's side kingpin for a
'66 bus.  This is for the bus I am picking up in Tennessee next month.  I'm leaving on Sat. April 17th and heading down thru Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Texas,, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee (of course).
So I'm hoping I can get one from somebody along the way, as it would be nice to have non-wobbly steering on the way home.
However, I'm passing several other places on the way back, so pretty much anywhere in the USA except the northeastern states would be fine.
Thanks in advance,
Diana
