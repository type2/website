&gt; Honest to God, I'm telling you the truth, you can do it yourself. For the
&gt; big money you will spend with a pro, you can do a pretty darn nice job in
&gt; your garage. The products these days go on easy and dry in about an hour. If
&gt; I was going to pay for anything, I'd pay for the body work. That's where all
&gt; the time goes.

Denis is correct.  But, please do yourself a favor and educate yourself on the
products and safety procedures of the current products!  The epoxy based paints
contain a form of cyanide.  These paints MUST be used with a positive pressure
breathing system (hobby systems run about 400 bucks new) or you can seriously
damage your lungs.

Check out http://www.autobodystore_dot_com   GREAT BBS and very knowledgeable pro
painters willing to answer any question.  Len who runs the site is a very
honest and helpful person.

I have no affiliation with the site BTW
