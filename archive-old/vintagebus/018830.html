Those buses with the sliding doors are dangerous and should be taken off of
the road.  I would be happy to do you the public service of handling the disposal.
What model is it?  The ones with the windows in the roof are the more insidiously
dangerous!

I've seen a few sliding door splits here in California; there's a greenish 
slider panel running around Sacramento.  I'd say it would be worth saving.

&gt; &gt; curious if you know of existence of these in the states because either I've 
&gt; &gt; owned to many older splits or this is an option that flopped.  I know your
