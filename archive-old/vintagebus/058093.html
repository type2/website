I can admit that I'm not currently a die-hard air-cooled driver. I have
4x VW's and only drive the bus on Friday, weekends and for errands that
need it's large capacity. 
 
However, I will try to use the &quot;it's too slow&quot; excuse, since I am
habitually late running out the door and my commute is 2x as long in the
bus. It's not that I don't enjoy it 2x, but my boss isn't quite so
understanding...

PS - I have a '92 Passat GL for sale if anyone wants a nice (and cheap)
water-pumper...
