Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Westfalia in Hot VW's

Robert,

Can't wait.   I've got a '61 So 23 (mango,sgg) and have downloaded a bunch of the pics of yours from Thom's site for reference.  And there is nothing plain ol' about your resto.  Your bus is the vision I see in my head when I look at mine.  Someday....

Looking forward to it.

&gt; Sheesh, it feels like I haven't posted a message in years.  How the hell is everyone??!!  I've been caught up mostly with life itself, and very little in buses.  That better change soon.
&gt;
&gt; Just got a call this morning from R.K. Smith at Hot VW's.  He came up in January to shoot my '59 Westy, and told me this morning that it will be in the June 2002 issue.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately it's just a plain ole, run-o-the-mill stock restoration, nothing fancy like the &quot;slammin jammin $30k barndoor deluxe panel what-cha-ma-call-it&quot;, so it might go totally unnoticed by the VW crowd.  I thought I would give everyone who is interested a heads up to be on the lookout for it.
&gt;
&gt; I knew I should have put bags under it.
