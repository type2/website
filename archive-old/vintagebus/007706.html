It was a good day. At least some work was done on my 63 project. Boy it
takes time. Body work is the most demanding of all. You keep working and
still it looks like you're in one place. I have grinded away those ugly
welds that were on the window frames of my bus. Someone at one point has
replaced the entire front including the cab with the front portion of the
frame as well with welds going around the entire body. The guy didn't even
grind the welds. Well, I'm doing all I can to make this a very straight and
nice daily driver. I'm really in pain that I can't drive it for now but I'm
looking forward to it with great pleasure. I just sit there in my garage and
pretend, well heck! it was a good day today!
