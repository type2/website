Hi Rex,
BTDT!  It makes one realize that having the suspension roll, steer, and stop 
properly is more important than anything else in automobiles.  Just pay more 
attention to the details, do not rush, and do things right the first time!  
Alot of volks will accuse you of being anal, but once you do things this way 
it will take only a short time of driving to relax you with the knowledge you 
have done it the correct way.   Eric&amp;Barb
