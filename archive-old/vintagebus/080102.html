Vintage Meet

Left Bellingham, WA at 1:30 pm Friday and drove down Chukanut Drive to
Burlington, up Hiway 2, and down Hiway 9 to Bothel, then cut across to Lake
City way, and down 173(?) to BurgerMaster .  Top speed of my 1956 Kombi is
50 mph with my split case transmission so I can't go on I-5.  Total trip
time was 3 hours -- normally 1.5 hours on I-5 in a water pumper.  The back
roads of HiWay 9 are great, rural, two lane roads, and a 1 land bridge,
general stores, lakes, farms, and all sorts of restored vehicles and
motorcycles travel the road.  Not to mention Chukanut Drive is one of Card
and Drivers top ten scenic roads.

The 56 is pulling right on hard braking, so this is something I need to fix,
and the clutch cable needs tightening.  Not having a seat belt is also
causing me some driving tension that I would like to avoid.

Got the last of the good parking spots at BurgerMaster, and help set up for
the T-Shirt and raffles sale.  Great cars at BurgerMaster, however the
parking lot is too small for all of them -- many near collisions from
parking and hot roding.  Overall great meet, BurgerMaster was giving away
coke glasses -- and since I collect coke glasses and didn't have these it
was an extra bonus.  Saw and had time to talk to Kascade Kombi member that I
don't see but once a year.

Left BurgerMaster at 9:00 pm returned to Ken's house which is 12 blocks
away, and loaded my Kombi with Ken's swap meet goodies.  Crashed in the
guest bedroom, and awoke at 5:00 am.

Left Ken's at 5:15 and arrived at 5:30 to help set-up the meet for swap area
opening at 7:00.  There were already two dozen swappers lined up at 5:30
waiting to get set-up.  

At 7:00 helped Ken set-up his swap area after doing my volunteer duties with
the club.   For the rest of the day I help Ken sell stuff at his area,
looked over the show and browsed the swap meet.

My definition of helping Ken, is when he wants to wander around, I give big
discounts on his stuff for my amusement, example: Selling his 1949 factory
prototype middle seat (barndoor) for $20 to some teenager what wants to
create an outdoor sculpture, then spending the rest of the day telling Ken I
have never seen anything like that and he must have left it at home.  Of
course I pocketed the cash.  It really is a great arrangement, Ken lets me
stay in his guest bedroom, and park my van safely in his garage Friday night
and I &quot;man the fort&quot; when he needs a break at the swap meet.

Parked the 56 in the show area with commercial vehicles and later in the day
won owner choice second place in class.  Again this year the 56 was the
oldest Type II in the show, no barndoors.  However, there was another 56
single cab in the swap area, and many bugs that were older in the show.

Also meet Rich and Ryan from Bellingham, and signed them up to the
Bellingham Chapter of the Kascade Kombi, so I will have someone to Caravan
with next year, and maybe we will head down to monthly in Seattle.  Great
Guys!

Also got to talk to a lot of great people at Ken's swap area, and talked to
Clara which is always a treat.  Overall a fun day of socializing and VWs.

Oh ya, there was some Californian up buying up parts at great prices, and
loading up tons of steel and chrome to haul back -- which always amazes me.

Left the show around 4:00 pm after helping Ken tear down his swap area, and
started home, same route back arrived at 8:00 pm Saturday -- very tired.

Note:  There was some amazing BBQ at the show this year as a concession, and
I also stopped for BBQ in Arlington (Hiway 9) at BAM! BBQ which was also
very good.  Also, they raffled off this really nice 62 bug, and a great oil
painting, great show with lots of cars and people.
