&lt;&lt; Barb and Eric, 
  Thanks for the tip. If I wanna use it in six months what do I do to get the 
oil out of the tank?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Drain excess oil out of tank after coating interior.  Install in bus when 
ready.  Fill with fuel, and drive.  The small amount of oil will mix with the 
fuel, and burn off.  Hardly enough for you, and your engine to notice.   
After all almost all VW engines burn a little oil that they draw through 
thier rings.  Thus the major reason for the oil level changing when running 
an engine.  We have had only one engine that did not use a drop in 3,000 
miles, and due to this kept perfect oil level.  Do check the VW shop manual 
for rust removal procedures, and definitely wear eye protection, if not a 
complete face shield.  Eric&amp;Barb
