Subject: [VB] Re: search function page and distributor questions

Thanks for all the advice possible alternatives to my 009.
	I apologize if this subject is boring yawn, but I am a bit of newbie.
The 009 is fairly smooth if the rpm accelation rate is on the higher side.  But I get a little bucking when I am in traffic and having to go from stay in second gear. The person in front of my slows down just enought so its not quite slow enough for first and I have to go from a bit of a lug in second back up to speed.
	I am getting about 30deg total advance but I think I might retard the time a bita idle.  With the timing light a see some of that scatter ( I think ) at full advance.  Gary, I am sure you are right, I probably can get dialed in, I'll experiment a bit more.
	The data on possible dizzy alternatives has been great! Also there are the articles in the library and oldvolks_dot_com really good data sheet there.
	Is there a database on the net somewhere that people have there engine set up with regard to timing, dizzy, carb etc..?  I recently saw one which has high perf. setups &gt; 1600 but any that include the all too common mishmash &lt;= 1600cc motor?
	I might be interested in compiling the info myself if people want to submit.  It seems valuable since so many of us have none stock motors.  It might also be neat to include vehicle type, tranny specs, driving style &amp; speeds, mpg, etc...
	thanks again my bus will be getting a good christmas present = a donation to type2_dot_com!
	-rob
