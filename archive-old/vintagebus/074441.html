 Steering is much better.  I wouldn't say perfect, but maybe it is just
 different than the 71 bus and takes some getting used to.

yes, they do drive drifferently than a a 71.   probably the king pins and 
swing axle  rather than ball jooint and CVs.

 1)  Boyfriend was driving behind me and said the tires look VERY EXAGGERATED,
 the way they point in in the back.  How much is TOO MUCH ???
 .............
you mean how they tilt in?    Okay look in your idiot book.  I think the how 
drives a VW chapter.   There'll be pictures of a bug emopty, medium load, and 
hellaloaded.   the rear wheels pray according to the load.  This is normal.  I 
can't see yours, but the swing axles do this thing.
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 2)  Turning.  U-turns.  When I make a tight right the wheel turns fine, feels
 normal.  But when I turn hard left .. the wheel is turning and then seems to
 stop hard with less of a turn.  I have yet to turn the wheel to the right
 where is just can't turn any further ... is this normal ?? Left U turns are
 next to impossible  .. or have to be VERY wide U-turns.
 ..................
you should have the same amount of turn to the right as to the left.  If not, 
the pitman arm is on the wring place on the shaft out of the steering box.   
Is this something that happened recently?   Like after the alignment? 

This happened to me once, except the change happened after I was hit on the 
Left frotn wheel by an idiot driver.   The force hit bent the tie rod, and I 
turned tight to the right, and large to the left.   good tie rod fixed it.  

  Then take it back to the alignment folks and explain how to adjust the 
steering wheel.  it's in the idiot book.  ask did they take the pitman arm off the 
shaft out of the steering gear box and rotate it instead of adjusting the 
length of the drag link (which is how it is supposed to be done)  

I think that most cars don't adjust teh steering wheel straightness the 
splitty way, and old books are rarely around.
