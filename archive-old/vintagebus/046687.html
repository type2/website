&lt;&lt; roofing tar is not a fixall for safaris. &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
This is unfortunitly probably true, but if it reduces the amount of water 
getting into the bus it hopefully will last longer against the rust.  Also we 
are wondering if during the winter wet months up here, if tar would even seal 
the window frame to the outer seal better than duct tape.  The plus side of 
this is that the tar cleans up easily with kerosene or other orange product 
degreasers and does not look as bad as duct tape on the outside.   Eric&amp;Barb
