Subject: Re: [VB] Underdash gas heater question

I have one of these heaters in my 65 Kombi....   and this past summer I did
about 13000 miles from July untill about end of October- mid November...
many miles were with a friend of mine who is about 6'...   he didn't
complain about lack of leg room...

At first when I first bought the bus I wasn't too sure how I liked the
heater....   but now i have grown attached to it... not to mention how it
puts the heat right where you need it...  up front !!   It works great when
the cold weather comes....

Subject: [VB] Underdash gas heater question


I have a Splitty under dash gas heater that I have never installed in my
bus.  I live in FL so it is not like I *really* need it except for the few
days a year it gets cold during the winter and a couple days during the
summer when I am on vacation in the mountains.  For the other 360 days I'm a
little worried about the amount of legroom it will take up.  Does anybody
have one of these installed who can tell me about how the passengers comfort
is effected?

Thanks,
Dan
