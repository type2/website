&lt;&lt; when I first dismantled the engine in my bus shortly after I had bought 
it, the heat riser tubes were plugged - i.e. the holes that connect to the 
exhaust were not drilled out - they had never been open and still had a thin 
piece of steel blocking the air. I drilled holes to open them up - is this 
the way intake manifolds come sometimes?&gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
Would be interesting to know where this engine came from that way.  Often 
high performance volks will do this to increase the air density by not 
allowing the lower section of the intake manifold to be warmed up especially 
during the warmer season.  On the other hand if one lives in an area where 
the temp drops below 60f this setup can really be a bugger to just keep 
running due to all the ice formed inside the manifold chocking off the engine 
from getting either fuel or air.  Eric&amp;Barb
