&gt;&gt;OK flame spew.
&gt;&gt;... as soon a I hear from each candidate on a form &gt;&gt;letter  in OBR
&gt;&gt;so bentley can hear from NEATO as well...

A form letter in OBR isn't the only way for Bentley to hear from NEATO. 
When Thom began this campaign, he posted a request for release of
information from the NEATO Registry to back up his point that there are
many pre-63 buses still out there.

I replied to him that the NEATO Registry has over 400 registered pre-63s
and I assume he passed that information along, or counted them in the
800+ he cites on his petition web page.  The count of older buses is all
he got, though.  As with VintageBus, NEATO doesn't &quot;sell&quot; the identities
of NEATO Registry people.

NEATO members are people with buses and minds of their own.  If they
want to support the Bentley campaign, they are free to.  Many of the
names already on the petition are NEATO members. You can now find my
name at the top of the petition list, but 'Net requests represent only
one way to influence Bentley.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;I'd love to hear from all the candidates

As with NEATO members, NEATO candidates have their own opinions,
connections and mechanisms to pursuade Bentley on this subject.  Some of
those means to pursuade have nothing to do with Thom or VintageBus, but
add another dimension to the same effort.

For Bentley, producing another manual is a matter of cost effectiveness,
not a matter of drying the tears of someone whining to get a book
published.  They work in the analog world where market research, editing
and production take time and money to produce a quality product.

This candidate has already supported Thom's Bentley campaign, eventhough
I don't own a pre-63 bus.  NEATO's nubers have been counted (though I've
not heard for a similar call to S*T* for help).  

Stan Walforth, of Bentley, is well aware of NEATO.  I've spoken with him
in the past, as have other NEATO executives.  We are fortunate to have
him where he is.  A more sympathetic ear at Bentley would be impossible
to find.  The last thing I'd want to do is hang him out to dry for
pushing publication of a manual that sits in a warehouse while we steal
all the information we can find online.

By all means, VintageBus subscribers, support Thom's petition as you see
fit.  Beyond the cyber-voices, there are other efforts, both individual
and collective, being taken to support the same campaign.
