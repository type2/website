It is next weekend! Be there or be square. :-)

Oktoberbus - Union Grove, NC near Stateville. A buses in the woods event. 
Come for bus fellowship October 8, 9, 10, 1999. The web page was updated a 
few weeks ago with a link to the campground to use their maps. The link was 
acting funky last time I checked, so email me for directions if needed.

Bonfire Saturday night with door prizes. Carabus Sunday AM to Farmington VW 
swap and drags. Always a great time.

Remember when you get there to keep driving back and down. We are in the back 
way away from the regular sites. Hot shovers, and in the event of a downpour, 
we can move all the busses inside! It never has been needed. :-) The forecast 
is looking good at this time!

The event shirts are going to be embroidered this year. I took one to Hanging 
Dawg, and it was a hit. The design is the front of a deluxe splitty on the 
left chest. The order deadline is over, but if you are going to come and ask 
in the next couple of days, I can do one with YOUR bus colors. Let me know 
the color (white over green, red over black, one color etc..) and the size 
NOW. 

See you there!
