Hi,
Also make sure to check tranny oil level once the bus is back on the ground!  
While your bus may have not leaked sitting still it might have done so when 
or shortly after turning the one way to slosh oil out of this boot.  Just 
before tightening the clamps on the small end of these boots when installing 
them it is a good idea to push the small end of the boots just a little 
toward the tranny (About 1/8&quot;.) to give it a bit of slack in the boots.  Then 
tighten the clamps.  So when cornering the boots do not experience stress and 
strain when the swing axles move to thier extreme positions.  This is most 
important when the boots are replaced while the bus is on it's wheels.
