 I've got a real concern here folks.  I haven't put my 1776 in the bus yet
 but it's gonna HAVE to happen before the July 15th OVWC show in Omaha, NE.
 Here's what I'm concerned about.
 
 It's no secret that putting a freeway flier trans in a bus drops the rpm of
 the engine in relation to the speed of the vehicle.  With my 1600DP and a
 mild load, it just can't hack it - I was driving floored back from KCMO.
 The engine was working really hard too.
 
 Does this mean that no matter what Type 1 engine size  I run (anything from
 a 1600DP up to a big old 2.2 litre), I'm condemned to overheating or will
 the 1776 give me enough power gains to pull me out of this slump?  Even
 though I like to cruise fast in the bus, I don't like running hot so I'm
 half tempted to yank my flier and sell it and run the stock 67 trans.
 
 I'd like to hear comments and real world experiences.  Thanks!

I know what you mean.   Seems the people who are real happy with the freeway 
flier tend to have fat motors and/or small nut reduction boxes.  My camper 
has the 3.88 and big nuts.  It has a 1600sp.   It does not have overheating 
problems like you do, but it does notice the hills more than when it had the 
previous tranny (which turned out to be a 4.12 with a bug 4th)   I don't 
think this set up is BAD, i think it would be better one notch lower geared 
or with a fat motor.

Don't know why you are over heating.  That is not endemic to higher gearing.  
 I find my motor cools better at 2600-2700 rpms than 3500 rpms, so if it is 
hot over going slower helpscooling.  I installed the temp sender after I the 
3.88 I think , so can';t give any engine heat changes.
