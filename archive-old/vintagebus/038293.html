Subject: Bentley cheaper than $65.52?
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 13:37:56 +0200
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi list,

I am in super cheap mode and would like to to know if anyone has a cheaper
source for the Bentley than Alldirect's $65.52 at
http://www.alldirect_dot_com/book.asp?cartID=504545307120000710&amp;isbn=0837603919

Also has anyone ordered anything from this store and if so how do they rate?

TIA

Michael\
