&gt;I didn't do a thing to them but now that I'm driving they squeal
&gt;like mad when I'm moderately (normal) stopping. If I really stand on the
&gt;brakes it goes away. Today I took the wheels off repacked the bearings
&gt;(for my road trip to Utah in May) and I readjusted and cleaned up all
&gt;the brake stuff. I figured I'd be good to go. But noooo. There just as
&gt;loud now as ever.

Sounds like your drums are glazed. If you had (have) hoses that had failed
internally and do not let the fluid return to the reservoir, you will get
glazed drums from the heat. If you have not replaced the hoses, do so at the
earliest possible convenience. As for the squealing, get some really rough
sandpaper and go at the inside of the drums. Do not sand anything, just
scratch them up. Really. Don't sand. Scratch. All in circles or something.
Make them kind of unshiny all the way around. I like 40 grit paper from a
floor sander for this. Should take care of it.
