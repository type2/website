hey thom...
how does one get info posted to the library. i have been collectiing responses
to certain questions i have posted to the list, and think they  would be
helpful to others...so they don't have to fish through the archives...are
there requirements.
Most of the info is not info i came up with, just kind of compiled from
responses..

-kevin
