Took Rosie on her first real road trip. Modesto to Mount Lassen (who knew
Mt. Lassen was still buried under 10 ft. of snow). Two days, 650 miles, 20
mpg., speeds 60-85 mph, oil temps mostly below 180, spiked to 200 during an
85 + mph run down highway 99. NO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS! Lots of positive
response from people along the way. I love my truck!

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
