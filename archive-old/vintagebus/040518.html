Hello Listees,

Thanks for all the replies about my purchasing a tow bar.  It seems that the 
list consensus is that this is a pretty good deal.  I have a follow up 
question now, when I go to inspect the tow bar, or talk with the fabricator 
about it, what are some key points that I need to watch for?  In other 
words, where do most cheap tow bars fail?  What pieces should be reinforced 
and how?  What do I look for / ask about so I can be sure that the tow bar 
he is assembling is going to do the job?

TIA,

Mike A.
