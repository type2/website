Hi everyone,

I just want to thank those who organized this weekend's mid-Missouri (Lake
of the Ozarks) camping festivities for such a nice time.  Members of all
three Missouri NEATO Chapters were invited to meet and camp together in the
middle of the State.  Nice location, beautiful weather, nice Busses and
good Type 2 friends!  Even though I had to leave on Sat afternoon to be
able to go to work Sunday morning, I had a nice time.  My 160 mile journey
home to St. Louis was pleasant and uneventful, my '67 Campmobile ran
beautifully, the oil temp never got above an indicated (and pretty
accurate) 200 degrees, and all the truckers roaring by me didn't even blow
me around too much while heading eastbound.  I hope the rest of you all had
a great Sat. evening around the campfires, and I'll bet that Rick Taylors
fajita's were great!  Have a safe trip home this afternoon!

Bill Bowman
NEATO
