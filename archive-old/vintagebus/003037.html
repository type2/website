Hey Volks

I recently found an under-construction 67 hardtop deluxe. This bus is a real
beauty, no rust at all. It had a severe front end smash, and has had a
complete nose clip replacement, very professionally done. Unfortunately the
resto is not to orig spec, but this is still a coool bus with great
potential.

Dig these M-codes. Can't get much more loaded with desireable options than
this:
