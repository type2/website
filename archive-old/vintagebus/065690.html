Subject: Re: [VB] still won't start, bad wiring or coil??

Voltmeter.  Key on engine off. Black probe to something bare metal in
the engine compartment. Red probe to each of the two coil connections in
turn. Should see voltage on at least one of them.  (Preferably the one
with the wire not going to the distributor.)  If you have voltage there,
then bad points, condensor or coil.  If no voltage there, bad wiring or
key switch.

Voltmeter. Remove (should be) green wire from coil to distributor. Black
probe to wire, red probe to coil terminal.  Key on, engine off. Rotate
motor clockwise using spark plug socket on generator pulley nut. 
Voltage should go on, off, on, off...  No?  Always on? Bad points or 
condensor. Always off?  Either bad coil or points gapped waaaaay wide.

There's more, but that's a start.

&gt; Listees,

&gt; Still trying to get my 66 13 Window to start, just bought her on new 
&gt; years day.
&gt; 
&gt; Per Muir book, I tested the coil and it didn't spark at all, so I'm 
&gt; thinking bad coil right?
&gt; 
&gt; But used Volt meter on one of the terminals with the key on and didn't 
&gt; get any Volts, does this still mean a bad coil, or is the wiring to the 
&gt; coil bad.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really confused and am not even positive I did the coil test 
&gt; right....any advice info would be greatly appreciated.
