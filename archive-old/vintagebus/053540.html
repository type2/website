&gt; Thanks to the MANY encouraging responses and advice I have received from
all listees. The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning on using
(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope is long enough-
has someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport) trailer and can vouch
that the bus will actually fir on the trailer?

Yep, trailered a 66 from  Redding Ca. to Albuquerque on one.  Can't say
much for the condition of the brakes and tires, but it made it.
Make sure your tow vehicle is heavy enough. Recommended top speed is 45
mph.  65 felt reasonable with my set-up.
