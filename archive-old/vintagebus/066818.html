Subject: Hoops on a binz question

Hi Wade,

  I had the same problem with the 61' side loader with the middle hoop. I
ended up getting the front pieces cut out of another SC and welded them
in.  It took some very careful cutting with a 4&quot; cut-off wheel and a
Dremel cut-off wheel and all the neat little brown and green tipped
grinding stones to make a near-perfect fit for welding.  The pieces were
about 5x4 and that took about 2 hours to weld in without blowing through
the thin metal. I cut the rear about 1&quot; up into the pressed up metal so
you can have the get the down slope looking good.  Then you got to clean
up the weld spots after. Can't tell if they were not stock holes now.  
Although it was easier in the side-loader because there is bay area.  

  Since the hoop mounting hole in the bed are very close to the seam.  
Measure very carefully and in-line with the back holes and take the time
to do it right.

  I'm not sure it you could do it any other way, I thought about it a long
time and could not come up with anything else to do.  I'd be interested in
Kelly's reply also.  He said he butt welds alot.

Best,
joe
