Subject: RE: [VB] Towing a splitty with folding / quick disconnect 
  setup(long)

[snip]
&gt; Any thoughts on reversing the dolly... turning bus around and putting
dolly on the rear... and using the tack on lights on
&gt; roof :)
&gt; It would allow the ligher front to bounce if something hit belly pan?
Maybe I'm not thinking this through?
&gt;

If you were to reverse the tow dolly, the belly pan (and the steering box)
would be in danger of bottoming out.  Another problem would be the sway from
left to right, although I suppose you could minimize that by tying down the
steering wheel with a belt.

If you do give it a shot, keep us posted; I for one would like to know how
you make out.
Good luck!!
