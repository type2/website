I have been searching for a westy hanging light that plugged in abovethe closet and hung over the eating table.

-------------------------------------------------------

there was a young guy at puyallup that had one, tried to sell it to rick crandal, was complete with the cord and switch and was only a little out of round, the best that i've seen. Rick didn't need another and I don't have a 64 so I passed. I don't know his name, anyone know who he was? If I remember correctly was in the 150 - 200 dollar range.

btw rick had a complete nos replacement cabin floor for an early split (pre 63 i think)
