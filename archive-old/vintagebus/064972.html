Subject: Re: [VB] oil cooler heater

Best solution with MANY more times the heat is a gas heater!! 
--------------------------
I'm not going to disagree on that.
I've seen the discussion of oil coolers used as heaters come up each year
and although I've never done one there isn't any reason a simply
contrived cooler wouldn't provide heat for the interior.
The heat on both my 66 and 83 air cooled is sufficient for my climate so
I haven't experimented.
It is also my strict policy not to put a hole anywhere in either Westy
that the factory didn't see fit to put there.
