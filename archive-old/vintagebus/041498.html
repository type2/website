&gt; &gt;  a 185 tire, if i recall, has a crosssection of around 6 inches (no

&gt; 
&gt; 185/xx/xx, 205/xx/xx, 195/xx/xx, etc. are all measurements in mm of the width of
&gt; the tire, not necessarily the thread mind you, but the tire itself..

I know.

A 185 tire is aproximatly 185mm across at the widest point of its bulge,
unloaded, mounted on the &quot;optimal&quot; size rim.;)

What i was saying is that i dont have the metric (mm) to standard (inches)
conversion formula on hand to get the exact (aprox) dimension...I never
can remember it, and the calculator i had that does it is dead.

Of course, all of that varies from manufactures to manufactures, as well
as model to model.



&gt; 
&gt; and while were at it xxx/50/xxx, xxx/60/xx, etc. is the percentage of the width
&gt; that makes up the height (sidewall)
&gt; 
&gt; xxx/xx/14, xxx/xx/15, etc. I don't think I need to explain......................
