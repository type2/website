&gt; Regarding the retorquing of heads, I am concerned that the head studs are
&gt; pulling out of their threads in the case. I read recently on the list that
&gt; there are case saver studs. How do these work?

Hi Dave,
If the studs hold when you retorque them then they most likely are fine.  
Case savers are a solid steel insert that are threaded internally for the head 
studs to fit into and have a larger outer diameter.  Due to the larger outer 
diameter these inserts have a stronger hold into the aluminum/magnesium engine 
case.  Even with case savers the head studs can pull out if the engine case is 
over heated to the point the alloy is softened!!!  Depending on stud position 
bigger outer diameter case savers can be used, and yes they can be installed 
with the engine case stripped down to a short block on that side.
