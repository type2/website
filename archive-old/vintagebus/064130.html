Subject: Re: [VB] Upgrading to good heating [long!]

This is all perfect if your heating tube is all gone. The one in my Bus is
nearly perfect... no rust but I was just thinking about investing into some
kind of a booster fan with a switch.... something I can turn &quot;ON&quot; whenever I
need extra heat up front. Sounds like a bad idea in the back since heating
tube comes right from the heat exchanger. That rear tube is completely gone
in my Bus. It was suggested to me that Kelly (Metwiz) makes these - sounds
like tomorrow I'll make a few phone calls. I'm not bringing this Bus to it's
&quot;factory look and feel&quot;. I want it to be &quot;My Bus&quot;.... as much original as
possible with a few small, personal changes that would not effect the
&quot;Vintageness&quot; of it. Now, see? I just created a new word...

Thanks all. Sounds like a plan.

&gt; Andre and list...
&gt;
&gt; Here's the solution I came up with to deliver LOTS of hot air to my bus
&gt; cab without having to use any extra or exotic equipment:
&gt;
&gt; Basically what I did is replace the existing mess with a continuous
&gt; hose, and insulated it along its entire length with closed-cell foam
&gt; sleeving, POR'ed for extra durability. Read the results at the end.
&gt; Here's the details:
