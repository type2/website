Ronnie and I discussed this in detail, and did some number runs.  Yep, it
sure seems like the larger tires of the 15&quot; wheels make a substantial
difference.  5MPH at 3800 RPM is the general consensus...

I'm sure that to some people this was clear all along, but it is just now
becoming clear tht the change from 1.39 to 1.25 redux boxes had more to do
with the tire size change than anything!

It is now starting to make sense why my '63 Double Cab is so much better on
freeway than my '67 Westy.  I have 205 15&quot; on the '63, which are LARGER than
the stock 15&quot; -- so makes a big difference when I went to 3.88 and .82
4th...

I hadn't realized how much my proper sized 14&quot; tires were hitting me...

Anyway -- the method of turning crank and counting wheel turns is working
great so far!

Hi:
Yes, the number is right according to my bently manaul.  Maybe it's because 
of the tire size?
