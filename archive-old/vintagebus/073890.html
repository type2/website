&gt;No offense to you miss Laura but I'm sorry, and flame me if you'd like,
&gt;but why the HELL would any vintage VW enthusiasts want to help VW????
&gt;
&gt;Those jokers have been trying to shut down VW related web sites for over
&gt;two years.  They systematically destroyed any and all factory parts
&gt;production and have actively pursued the closing down of after market
&gt;parts production.  That company does not support people trying to keep
&gt;older cars/busses running, and is in fact hostile towards them.  But,
&gt;when they want to play on the nostalgic heart strings to get people
&gt;interested in a new product, well, they're really friendly.
&gt;
&gt;Just my .02, but SCREW YOU VW!
&gt;  
&gt;
I'll have to 2nd that!!
