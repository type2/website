Subject: Re: 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

Some South African bus twin cab input...

My RHD Double cab is a '67 and has the suicide door ~ I am sorry for the
poor quality of the image, it was the only one I had on my PC... if
anyone wants better pics, I can snap off a few this evening.

Michael Evans also has a RHD double-cab with the suicide door, but his
is an earlier bus...
