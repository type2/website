&lt;&lt; 
 By installing shimms under your cylinders, your are moving your cylinders and
 heads farther out from the engine case.  Thus in effect you are widening your
 engine.  Make sense??  Here in lies the problem, you cannot use your stock
 exahaust system without cutting it up, and lengthening it to fit the now
widder
 engine.  I found this out the hard way....I put together a 1600 single port,
used
 .060 shims underneath my cylinders to get to a safe compression ratio, 7:0 -1
I
 recall.  The shims added so much width to the engine, not only could I not
get the
 atock exahaust to fit, but the SP intake manifold would not fit either!!

Hi Todd,
Good point, but the problem that can also happen is that the heads and/or case
where the cylinders can have been flycut to improve the squareness and sealing
of these areas.  Thusly the width of the entire engine can go the opposite way
towards being too short for the exaust system to fit in extereme instances.
For stock engines the pistons should come up to about .070&quot; from the top of
the cylinders.  If short there then you should shim under the cylinders.  If
you have this measurement and the heads are too small cc to bring the CR down
to about 7:1 then you might want add up to about .040&quot; more at the most to the
shims under each side of the cylinders, but only after seeing how much you can
carefully remove from the head chambers either by hand or hemi-cut.  This
should keep thing in the area that allows the stock muffler to mount.  Yes one
could cut and weld the muffler, but then you had better cary your welder and
cutting tools on your trips so that if the muffler fails you can modify the
next one.  Running the VW engine with no muffler or a bad one can over heat
the engine due to leaning out the mixture from having less back pressure.
Also when installing parts on the VW engines that have lots of fasteners,
especially the muffler one should loosely mount all the fasteners first then
tighten them down, this gives you a little play movement to get all the
fasteners in place.   Eric &amp; Barb
