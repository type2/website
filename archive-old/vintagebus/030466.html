Hi all,

The following are my two baby's

1&gt;  Jack is a 1959 23 window that was born and raised in Germany (ie has
semaphores).  He is in a state of gray aquisition.  In other words, he is in the
primer paint I bought him in, and I'm slowly getting all the parts I need.  He
is coming along slowly, but nicely

2&gt; SB (or Stupid Bus as my girlfriend so affecionatly named her) is a 1961
Sub-hatch Westy.  She is the current project and has her rear end scattered
around the garage.  (I pulled the tranny to re-seal it)  Currently she is Earl
Shieb &quot;Baby Poop Tan&quot;, (PO did that to her) but one day will be her original
colors of Mango Green and Seagull Gray.  She is mostly complete, and sleeping in
her is more comfortable than my bed at home.  She is great, and will be
recieving quite a few new roof parts from parted buses, as the roof is pretty
bad.

Thanks,
Aaron
