There have been a lot of posts about this subject; and a lot
of disagreement.

Going from 92 to 100 octane will not give you any advantage,
assuming a stock engine.

&gt; i have always been told to put at least 92 octane fuel in aircooled motors
&gt; because it helps keep the valves cool from the low combustion rate. since
&gt; there is no lead to protect the valves. My question is what would a higher
&gt; octane (100, 110) protect it even more, or would it harm the engine in some
&gt; way? I know that you should nto jump down to a lower octane after using a
&gt; higher one, but can you jump to a higher one? There is a gas station right
&gt; by my house that has 100 and 110 racing fuel. they also have non-ethanol 92.
&gt; I put the 92 non-ethanol in my souped up gti. would it have any advantage in
&gt; a bus?
