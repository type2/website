Subject: CRRRRUUUUNNNCCHH- Toasted Tranny??

Hay Y'all,
I am working on this 67 that has been sitting for a
few years.
I drove it up and down the driveway today and it was
making a terrible crunching, grinding noise form the
rear end. I Topped off gear oil in tranny and RGB's,
the noise is still there.
I put the back end up on jack stands with the wheels
and drums off and started the engine. When I let the
clutch out, the grinding begins, I also notice the
back axles are turning with the tranny in Neutral and
the clutch out. I go through the gears while it is up
on the jack stands, and the noise gets worse in each
higher gear, its a very ugly noise!  DOes this sound
like a toasted tranny?  Maybe thats why the bus was
put out of commission in the first place???
Any ideas?

=====
Peace, John Baker
