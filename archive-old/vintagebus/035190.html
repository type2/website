Subject: RE: [VB] Fitting my bus in my garage

Granted I am not familiar with your particular garage setup, but this would
work on most typical motorized dropdown garage doors I know of.

Usually there is some &quot;slack&quot; in the system which you can tighten up.  There
is a top cut off switch and a bottom cut off switch.  Take the top cut off
switch and loosen it and push it back a few inches and retighten.  This will
pull the garage door up the extra inch you need...  If that is not enough
get a helper, have the door in the up position, pull the safety cord
releasing the door from the electric opener, push the door up as far as you
can, and then reattach the safety line which will hold the door open.  

One of those tricks should definitely work for you... If you have a typical
overhead garage door.

Good Luck,
