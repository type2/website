I towed a double cab that was completly stripped of everything.
i made a dolly for the center of the frame , and made sure it was wide enough 
for my trailer, and strapped it to the dolly.
and then strapped everything really well to the trailer, towed it about 200 
miles.
and then just rolled it into my garage, its still up on it , veryeasy to move 
with one hand.
