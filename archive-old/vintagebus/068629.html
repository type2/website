&gt; Good sounding advise Thanks

Hi Tom,
Glad we could help!

&gt; I guess I'll end up with 14&quot; rims then?? What size tire is big but not too
&gt; big for a 66 195?,205?,215?

That would be a good archive research item since we try to stick to pre-1964 
VWs.
 ;-)

&gt; does the 65, 70. 75, (hate to sound so stupid) make a difference?

195, 205, or 215, etc. is the width of the tire tread in mm.  The /65, 70 or 
75 is the sidewall hieght in percentage to the tire thread width.  In other 
word 235/75R15 is a tire with 235 wide tread, and sidewall hieght that is 75% 
or 176.25mm tall, R stands for radial, and 15 is the rim diameter where the 
tire seats.

&gt; LT is what I want to side walls rated at!?!

Some LT (light truck) radials are softer and lower rated than some P 
(passenger) radials.  Thusly you have to inspect the sidewall rating of the 
tire to make sure it meets or surpasses the 1525 Lbs. factory minimum.

&gt; Y'all think then that the more appropriate tires  will negate the need for 
&gt; shocks??
&gt; Sorry to be a pest
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Tom
&gt; So.Ga.

Only time and the right tires will tell!
