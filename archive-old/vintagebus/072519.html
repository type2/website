Subject: Re: [VB] Can I put stock heads on 90.5 cylinders?

&quot;&quot; you can use standard valve heads punched to 90.5 until you get
your big valve heads fixed&quot;

Thanks, Ray.  That was one thing I was wondering about, but my question
is, again, embarrassingly: did I have my heads opened up so the 90.5
pistoned cylinders would fit properly?  This engine is the first and only
engine I built from scratch, and it was 10 years ago, and I just can't
remember.  Always have just built 1600's.  In other words, to put a 1600
based engine head on my 90.5 P &amp; C's, do I have to have any machining
done to the head?
