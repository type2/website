Subject: HELP!  More Overheating
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

well i ended up pulling the motor out twice.  First time I saw no results 
after cleaning everything up, checking everything I could think of and 
repairing and replacing some missing tin.  Second time I continued on the 
things I forgot the first time. Doh!  Anyways, I checked the heads for any 
leaks, checked valvetrain, checked oil cooler for any dirt or grime as well 
as checking to be sure that rubber o rings didnt collapse inside it and cause 
an oil flow restriction.  Checked the mixture at the carb, which seemed 
rather lean.  Fattened it up.  Timing is fine.  Valves are at .005.  the 
engine turns nice and smooth and it doesn't seem that there are any bearings 
snagging or any of that.  Checked all gaskets and seals.  Replaced seals for 
intake.  cleaned fan shroud.  And now with all this done I got word that 
maybe the oil pressure relief valve was stuck, restricting the oil flow.  
Removed inspected and all is fine there.  I originally thought that oil flow 
was the problem but oil pressure is just fine.  Now I stuck here completely 
stumped and really not wanting to have to tear down the motor completely.  My 
worst fear here is that I possibly spun a bearing but I do not know how to 
find this out.  The oil didnt have any significant particles in it.

  After about 10 minutes the engine heats up to the point where touching the 
dipstick for a second will burn your fingers.  Also have that nice cooking 
engine smell too.  So does anyone have any ideas?  Im getting desperate here.

The engine is a stock 1600sp with non doghouse oil cooler, single relief case 
sporting all new jugs, heads, etc..
