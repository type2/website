The problem is we don't know what size the bolts are supposed to be, and 
we're a bit nervous about trying random sizes, since it is a seatbelt and we don't 
want to mess up the threads and all. 
Hi Diana,
Does your friend have stock belts up front?  If so take one of the bolts out 
of them and try it BY HAND (threads can only be damaged if driven together by 
wreching) into the threaded holes for the rear belt mounts.  If it threads in, 
that is the size you need and a trip to a local used parts supplier with bolt 
in hand will result in proper procurement of this fastener!
