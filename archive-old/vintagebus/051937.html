Subject: Re: [VB] stock exhaust

Ooops, here is &quot;sufficient data&quot; I hope:
1600 dual port with thermostat and flaps
large bus oilbath aircleaner with ~1&quot; preheat (not cyclone big, but
not one of those little jobs)
Brosol H30/31 carb (117.5 mains, 60 pilot, 50 or 55 aux, 125 air
correction)
proper bus exhaust (repaired thanks to Thom's welding skills)

Jetting notes: tried 115 mains with the extractor, just a hair too
small but maybe it will work better now. Pilot seems a little big,
engine sometimes stalls at idle when cold.

Hi Joel,
As the old phrase goes &quot;Insufficient Data&quot;!  What type, size engine,
what
jetting, what air cleaner?   Right now you could have the proper
jetting for
the stocker muffler and have been running too lean up till now or the
jetting
could have been jetted for the extractor muffler and you will now run
too
rich.
Take a nap and then get back to us!   Eric&amp;Barb
