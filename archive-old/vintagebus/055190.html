Subject: AC in a bus

   Yesterday I had a customer walk in and ask if I would like an AC system
from a VW, of course I said yes and proceeded to look at what he had, I got
lucky, the AC system was a complete I C E  that I had helped another
customer get installed a couple years ago in his SB and the gentleman
offering it to me had removed it 1 1/2 years ago when he bought the car! I
got the same compressor (super small 134A), all brackets, crank pulley, 2
different condensers (the I C E system uses 2 of them), the under dash
control unit and the in the TRUNK evaporator unit, all hoses, etc. The cool
thing (no pun intended) is that the evaporator unit looks like it would fit
in the compartment under the front seat, so my idea of tying into the
existing heater duct work is still on. The SB (curved dlass) uses a unit in
the trunk that ties into there existing heat system. I remember this unit
freezing my cohunes off during the summer here when he showed me how good it
worked!.  The control unit is a small box with the fan and temp control
switches on it, it will mount nicely under the parcel tray. I will build
another stroker motor and install the unit on it and add external oil cooler
also to help cool the engine under a load. It looks like my wife will drive
the DC during the hot summer months now that it will have air.

ps, it's still hot in Havasu
