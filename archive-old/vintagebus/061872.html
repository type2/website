STOLEN VW BUS:


Here's the scoop - please pass on wherever it might do some good.  I'm
on the road working - it's construction season - in Mt. Vernon, and have
been informed my Green 1978 Westie (white poptop with kayak bars) was 
stolen
last night from the parking lot at Unlimited V-Dub.  On the one hand, it's
probably joyriders and I'll
get it back - on the other hand, I might not.  And lord knows what
torments Loki's suffering now.

Particulars:

Stolen Wednesday night, September 18 or early the 19th, from Unlimited
V-Dub on Rosewood in Orchards, Washington.

Green van with white poptop and a Yakima canoe rack with 76&quot; bars -
rather hard to miss.

Washington license #217 NUB.  The VIN is 2382138765.

Other distinguishing characteristics:  the cabinet fronts have been
painted a hideous green. There's a Century propane stove mounted on wire
stand behind the passenger seat.  There's a bunch of gloriously striped
bed linen piled up in back.  My brand-new Craftsman ratchet's under the
seat in a canvas duffel.  My green VW repair manual is on the floor.
The carpet is shag puke-brown-and-orange-tan-gross.  The pump and fuel
bottle from a nearly-new MSR mountaineering stove is in there somewhere.

The police were notified by me and by the shop at about noon on
Thursday, 9-19-02.

If sighted, call 911 - that's what they told me to do.

Thanks,

John Axford
