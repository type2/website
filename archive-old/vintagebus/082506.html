Subject: Re: [VB] Complete OG paint 63-15 window found in a Pick &amp; Pull

&gt;From: josh brothers &lt;oldsplit2003_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;&gt;

here in georgia you
&gt;dont, and im sure we can work something out to where i
&gt;can get it registered here, then send you a bill of
&gt;sale and registration to you, so you can have it
&gt;titled??? DO YOUR BIT, SAVE THAT SPLIT!!!
&gt;

Josh et al,
I was thinking of proposing somthing similar, as I live near GA, and I was 
going to contact a friend about a GA registration for a 71 save I'm doing.  
GA will just issure a registration, and SC will balk at that, but eventually 
caves in and issues a real live title.  That may be helpful.  I'll probably 
do the Titles Unlimited/Broadway thing for the 71, byt I may try to enlist 
your aid, Josh, in a parts/reciprocity deal.  IOW, if the East Coast can 
help, let us know.
