Im guessing its a clear needle speedo?
You need a &quot;needle puller&quot; to get it off.
My friend works in a restoration shop and restores airplane speedos.
I had him do mine.
He's also working on reproducing the clear needles....I keep pushing him!
If its a later while needle speedo, it should just pull off.

&lt;&lt; Hi all,


My speedometer needle seems to be draging a bit and I thought I would

'carefully' disassemble it and see if it was anything obvious...  But I

can't figure out how to take the needle off.  Does it pull off or is it

threaded?


Or, should I just send it off to someone and let them fix/clean it up.  If

so, who does good work.


Thanks
