Hi Ray,
Kind of depends.  Some volks run these engines with only two cylinders  and 
half the engine case!
  The tube works to drain excess moisture that otherwise builds  up in cooler 
weather in the crankcase.  If left in the engine it tends to  mix with the 
oil and cause a mayonaise like gunk that can clog the oil breather  tube going 
to the air cleaner.  Which in turn will cause an overpressure in  the crankcase 
and blow out oil around the rear pulley.
  Without the rubber valve the gasoline vapors that gets past the  piston 
rings into the crankcase can blow out the lower tube instead of being  sucked 
back into the air cleaner and burnt for not only better emissions, but  increased 
MPG.
  For more info see the 1963-67 &quot;Workshop Manual Volkswagen  Transporter&quot;, 
section M-9, page 7.
