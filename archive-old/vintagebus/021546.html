Subject: Re:  [VB] clutch pedal assem.
To: woody1_at_dsl.telocity_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Last Sunday I was doing some routine maintanance to my 64,

and while I was adjusting the clutch I noticed

the pedal wasn't coming all the way back up.I know the return spring was

reasonably new ( I replaced it last year)

On further examination I noticed the pedal pivot point( where the pedal

pivots on the frame)

was hanging up.I removed pedal assem. greased the pin and bushings and

reassem..

Now the pedal returns all the back to the &quot;up&quot; position and all is well.

I also installed all new locks on all handles and ign. to fit one key,

adjusted the brakes and adj. valves.

It's amazing how much one gets done when the Bears aren't worth watching.

wow- you got a lot done.   Wonder if you needed a new spring last year cause 
the pedal was getting sticky.  Afriend had a broken brake pedal return 
spring, and wher ethe lever pivoted there it was all crusty  and had to be 
disassembled et al like you did.  Worked a treat after wards.
