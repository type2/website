&lt;&lt;It's getting cold out, and I am thinking of hooking up the heater on my 
1970 bus (there were no flexible hoses connected from the fan shroud to the 
heater boxes when I bought it). I am a little concerned about some things I 
have read regarding asbestos in heater boxes, but apparently there shouldn't 
be any asbestos in my heater boxes since I have an upright 1600 dp engine. 
(Right???)&gt;&gt;
 Hi Dan,
Correct.  The only asbestos in the 1200-1600 upright engines that we know 
about other than the clutch is the gasket that goes in the sealing tin around 
the heat risers of the intake mainfold, and in some late models of VW on both 
ends of the platic heater box to body tubes.  It kind of looks like a very 
whitish gray material that has a dull felt texture to it.  Fortunitly in the 
plastic tubes the asbestos helps seal the ends of the tubes and if there was 
any asbestos to rub loose it would most likely be blown out of the tubes by 
the interanal air pressure.  Also recent information is that the short 
grounded up asbestos into this felt kind of material of these parts can not 
do the damage of the longer nastier strands that made up so much asbestos 
insulation of the past.

&lt;&lt;The piece that no one seems sure about is the insulating &quot;blanket&quot; that is 
wrapped around the long heating conduit pipe under the bus, from the back of 
the bus to just under the place where the front driving/passenger compartment 
begins. The &quot;blanket&quot; appears to be made of a vinyl-like substance on the 
outside, but apparently there is fibrous material on the inside...which some 
people speculate may be asbestos. Do you have any insight???  &gt;&gt;
No.  That is fiberglass cloth in there.  You can get the same stuff from your 
hardware store in the fiberglass repair area.      Eric&amp;Barb
