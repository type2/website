Subject: rims

Well, I must have really stepped in it by asking whether 15&quot; tires can
fit on 14&quot; rims. Nobody answered and gently showed me the error of my
ways. The answer seems kind of obvious now. So, another question; how
common are 15&quot; rims to buy for a bus? Can they be bought new? Are there
used ones out there? I read where somebody had rims from different years
and that was the best he could do, so maybe not. Additionally, is there
any advantage to one size over the other? I am running 14&quot; tires but
would upgrade to 15's if it seemed appropriate and affordable.

Thanks, Jason
