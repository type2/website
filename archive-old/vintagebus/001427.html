My bus is equipped with a Siberian 3x anti-theft device.  That is: 3 full
grown male Siberian Huskys that wouldn't hurt a fly, but you couldn't tell
by looking at them;o)

FWIW, I remember a ways back when car-jacking was just hitting the news as
the latest thing to look out for.  I seem to recall a testimonial in one of
the mags from a guy that spent a few thousand $ restoring his 23 window.
He'd just finished it and was taking out for an inaugural cruise somewhere
in SoCal.  Well while waiting at a light, someone stuck a gun in the window
and told him to get out of his bus.  Well he thought &quot;not my bus that I
spent all those months and $ restoring&quot;  and BLAM.  End result was a gunshot
wound in the head, laid up in the hospital and no bus.  My memory fails me
slightly, but I think he was either paralyzed to certain degree or just laid
up for a long time.  To me, the &quot;child&quot; analogy is ridiculous.  I am a
father and I would die for my child, not my bus.
