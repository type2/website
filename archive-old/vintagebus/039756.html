I am rebuilding the rear end in my 63 panel and opted to stay with the
rgbs. Not only do you have to not deal with switching out the spring plates 
(which I hear is a pain in the...) but you keep the clibing power. I have 
the freeway ring and pinion in my tranny and with a little bigger engine 
(1835cc) I am hoping to have all the power I need for comfortable cruising. 
Hope this helps in your decision!
