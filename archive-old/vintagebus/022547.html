What does the list think, oil or cylinder head temp? Which is more
important to watch? We are finally putting in a new engine in the '65
westy, and I want to watch it carefully on our up-coming trip to
Newfoundland.  Our '77 has an oil temp set-up, and it has been informative,
the oil temp going up when one would think it would, hot days, highway
speeds, hills. I don't know too much about what the head temp would indicate.

And by the way, the Litchfield show was great!  Over 350 show cars, lots of
buses, lots of slpit windshields, beautiful weather.
