 After 4 weeks without driving a split bus I couldnot take it anymore.
Bought a 1963 Type 215  mcode 080, 425. UA delivery so it is an original So
Cal bus, might  be one of the tons that I helped cut out the rear wheelwells
as these are cutout. !st fix will be the wheelwells. No rust and only a
couple of dents to fix and &quot; Peanut &quot; will be looking good.
