 Could I have 130 pounds compression, yet have a crappy enough CR to get no
 power like this??&gt;&gt;
Hi Brian,
What type of air cleaner, muffler, carb jetting, and what MPH in 2, 3, 4th 
gear at 1,500 and 3,000 RPM?  Have you checked all of the pieces of the DP 
manifold for straightness and polish to make sure everthing sealed up?

&lt;&lt;Jim ensures me the chamber volumes are 52cc's - they've done like jillions
of these new heads, so he should know he says.
So, I take'em home, and spend like the next 12 hours filling away all the
damned mold-flashing clogging up the fins and such, and the next day start
to installing them.&gt;&gt;
We have taken up using a well used carbide blade for wood and a circular saw 
to clean out the fins on the front and rear of the heads.  Takes about only 
three minutes.  Just keep a steady hand with practicly no pressure and not go 
into the head itself!  This leaves only about a half hour to hand drill/file 
clean up between the combustion chambers.

&lt;&gt;
Can definitely be unhelpfull.  Any bad wheel bearings, low tire pressure, 
etc., will do the same.
