&gt; I got an air cleaner for my '65.  Its a

&gt; 2&quot; I.D. hose with a 
&gt; flexible accordian section.
&gt; 
Do you mean the paper pre-heater hose that runs from
#4 cylinder to below the intake on thair cleaner or
the one that runs from the oil filler to the air
cleaner? For the hose that runs from the oil filler to
the air cleaner I use a piece of 1/2&quot; oil hose and it
fites perfectly. As far as the paper hose goes, have
they stopped making it?
