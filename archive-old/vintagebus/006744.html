The split buses have a raised area over the trans  which does not allow a
bay tank to sit flat, that's why the old Thom fix of denting it, I have
installed 68 to 76 tanks, a real pain with the later tanks due to the
perminate fuel taps and the fuel injection return lines, but they do give
you 2 pickup points in case 1 plugs up! So back to why the wood, to have a
platform for the tank to sit on so it doesn't rock and roll or warp or grind
a hole in the bottom, etc.

Hi Ronnie,
What are the wood supports for?  What is the width of the tan? ;-)  The 1968

and later tanks have a bottom made to fit the same pressed body supports as 
in 1955-67 buses.  Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
