Subject: Small-nut rear end wanted for my '54
Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 21:20:50 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

As you may remember, I recently purchased a '54 Single Cab.  It had Bug long
axles and brakes in it.  I traded the axles for a set of Big-nut
axles/reduction boxes/brakes, all off a running Bus, so they are good.
After discussion with a few listees, it appears the best match for my
Barndoor front brakes would be a set of small nut axles and reduction boxes.
Anyone got a good used set they want to trade for big-nut axles or sell?
I'd prefer it to be in my area (Phoenix, AZ).  I need a 6-volt transmission,
too, but may decide just to go for a new one in that area.  (Possible listee
discount somewhere?  :)  So, basically, I need a good-running entire
rear-end...

If anyone has any feedback on how small-nut axles/brakes do or do not match
up against a Barndoor front end, let me know.  The diameter of the drums
appear to be equal at approx. 9&quot; but I do not want to jeopardize safety.

Thank you,
Everett
