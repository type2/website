 Am looking for plans for a splitty hitch that is not bumper mounted or if
 you have a hitch laying around that would work too.  What are the list
 consensus (If there is such a thing) on mounting points for a hitch and if
 you have one that works good for you can you send the pics
 Thanks

I have one that bolts to the rear torsion tube, to haul the weight with.   
Their is also a bit that goes to the bumper, but that is just so it does not 
fall on the ground.  No, I would not think  useing the bumper as the tow 
would be the most sturdy, but I have seen them that way.   54 had a tow bit 
welded to its rear bumper.  Hella sturdy, the brackets were reinforced, made 
that flimsy stamped bumper something to be reckoned with.  only part that 
showed was the bit that the tow ball bolted to.  Dunno what the PO towed with 
it, they lived on a farm in Montana.  But that system is only as strong as 
where the place is the bumpers attach to, so light stuff it would be ok *one 
wheeled trailer), but towing a larger object like a bug or a bus I would not 
like that system.

If I had a digital camera I would take pics.
