YES! I remeber that...and do you believe I actually
had to almost physically 'force' him to buy it!!! HA
HA HA!!!  That was `94 and not to many folks into
those things.  i had driven my `67 westy from Ohio out
to the soto meet and think I was one if not the only
tents up at the time.  I remeber Jim kept coming back
to me saying..are you sure i should buy it and $190 is
not over priced...man it seems like alot!  hahaha!!!

I bet Jim would take all he could at $190 today, so
would I !! ;-)

&gt; Paid $190.00 for at the end of the last SOTO meet
&gt;held in
&gt; Escondito. Can you believe that it sat there for the
&gt; entire show? The seller wanted $250 and I even had
&gt; to
&gt; borrow some bucks from D.Denlinger at that show to
&gt; secure the deal. $190 was all that I could scrape up
&gt; and the seller went for it! Try that one in today's
&gt; market. Thanks to Todd Swangstu for telling me that
&gt; it
&gt; was at the show. I would have missed it. It's the
&gt; only
&gt; one that I've ever seen at a swapmeet.
