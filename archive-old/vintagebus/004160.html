The two rightmost fuses (red) are 16 amps (as opposed to 8 amps for the rest of 'em), so these are a good place for your stereo. The rightmost one is always hot and the one just next to it is only hot when the ignition is on. You want to run the radio clock/preset memory wire to the rightmost fuse, so that it will not forget your presets/time. As for the power wire, you have two choices: always hot (same place as the preset wire) or only hot with the ignition on (second fuse from the right).

Having the stereo connected to the ignition is nice for daily driving, so it will turn off when you kill the ignition and then come back on when you start 'er up. The disadvantage to this is when you're parked or camping. You will have to leave the key in the on position to listen to the radio, which will burn your points. I installed a switch under the dash so that I can change which fuse the stereo is powered by with the flick of a switch. Normally it's connected to the ignition, but if I'm parked, I flip it to &quot;always hot&quot; to listen to the stereo without burning the points.

Keep these two fuses in mind anytime you install something electrical. Are you going to want to use it while parked/camping (radio, accessory lighter plug, CB, etc.) or are you only going to need it while driving?

Also, once you have something continuously drawing power with the ignition off (like the memory wire to the radio), you will get a small spark when connecting the battery ground strap. This is normal, so don't go searching for a short until you've disconnected this wire.

Sorry so long, hope that helps :-)

&gt; Any body got any tips on a head unit instalation on a 12v.  Now I have a 
&gt; cheap radio power wire going straight to the right fuse on the fuse box.  
&gt; This keeps power to the LED on the radio when the bus is off.  Any ideas on 
&gt; where to put the red power cord so radio is off when bus is off and where to 
&gt; put the yellow wire to maintain your pre-sets?
