Again this list has saved my okoli
I just got back from a cursory crawl under the Kombi. (I'm so glad you
all
talked me out of lowering this beast)

doh!

The gas line that runs over the trans from the reserve petcock to the
steel line
that runs through the engine tin was not in its clippies and was doing
the
groove thing on the accelerator cable. These clippies make me nervous as
they only can be bent
 a certain number of times before they break...

BTW where the steel line goes through said engine tin (breast plate?)
the
grommet is missing so I put a old piece of  gas hose over the steel line
to cut
down on rubbing...

How many of you run hose clamps on the gas lines and where?

a big mahalo to the people who put out for this list!
our zero,
