I've got a '66 that's gonna be parted out. Can I use a cut-off wheel to cut
metal sections off the body. I'd like to try &amp; keep just about anything
that isn't crushed or rusted out. I don't have access to a torch, so that's
not an option. TIA

I have used various tools to dismember buses.  Which tool depends on
what/where you are cutting, and what you have access to

concrete saw (good in junkyards as is powered by a chainsaw motor (gas), but
heavy and not good for tight spots, but good for frame members)

oxy- acetene torch  good for tight spots, frame members, also portable, bad
for sheet metal due to warpage and the nasty reek.

sawsall-   No burning paint smell, needs electricity/extention cords, expect
to break bits, good for sheet metal, lower cost to tool up though

electric die grinder - watch out for your eyes,  good though

air powered die grinder - quieter than electric,  good for tight spots

hammer and chisel

special bits that drills out a little teeny circle around spots welds -  but
some spots welds are hard to get to.

 . .  . .. . 
whatever you use-   be super safety concious.    Good eye and ear protection
is crucial.  I recommend wearing a long sleeve shirt buttoned at neck and
wrists, sturdy jeans (no holes in knees), and sturdy boots.  I often use ear
plugs under these ear muff type ear protectors for the double deal.   Tie your
hair back (if applicable) how about wearing a hat.   Gloves are good too, for
sharp edges.  You learn a lot about how they are put together by taking them
apart.   some of those seams are wierd.     the grinder type tools can really
damage your eyes- i once got a thing in my eye and it was really annoying,
especially as I have a blind spot in one eye, and it was the good eye with the
metal in it, and I was seriously contemplating reduced vision the rest of my
life.   It turned out okay though, so I now look directly at what I am
grinding, as that piece got past the side guards.  I like the full face sheild
type visors.

watch where you cut- think about how to save the pieces best, make sure they
dont fall on you/your feet/your tools and break them.  measure twice, cut
once.   Draw lines on the bus if you feel like it.

Obligatory note:   Are you sure this bus is not savable?   Attrition grows,
and another one bites the dust.

Clara
