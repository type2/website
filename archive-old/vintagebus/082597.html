Subject: FW: [VB] Heater Tube

John -

Stay away from PVC.  It give off harmful vapors when heated.  I would rent a
welder, &amp; tack in a piece of steel drain pipe.  That is my plan.  I do
believe there is a &quot;Safer&quot; Alternative to PVC tho.  Just do not know where
it is.  Try the archives...

Now that it's almost November the winter weather is just around the corner.
I
have a 1966 Westfalia that lost it's center heating tube many years ago. I
have decided to replace the tube and get the heating system working once
again.

I would like to use some PVC piping to replace the missing center tube. Does
anyone know the dimensions of this tube?
