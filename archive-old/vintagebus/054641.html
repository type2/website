Subject: Re: [VB] Interior Question

Hi Don,
Definitely is not a Westie interior.  Though it looks like the manufacture of 
your interior was influenced by a Westie interior design.  If you have child 
cot clips up by the front seat the curve in the wood top of the closet 
probably held the cot there while in transit.   Eric&amp;Barb
