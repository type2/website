I had this exact problem with my '56, which turned out to be severely
corroded wires at the starter, which was causing an open to the front.

Sometimes I'd get in, turn the key, nothing.  Then turn the lights on, then
off, and then IU could start the bus just fine.  I could also push/hand
crank it in this condition and it would start.

I replaced the connectors to the starter, and cleaned all the wiring up,
and it never bothered me again.

Check the ground strap, too.

&gt;This morning on the way out to work the bus died electrically.  Lights
&gt;off, engine off, all quiet.  I thought the battery cable was to blame as
&gt;it's been acting flakey lately, but I just finished putting a new one on
&gt;and nothing! 
&gt;
&gt;Facts: 1 - Battery good.  2 - Fuse box has a hot lead from the battery. 
&gt;3 - I'm tired, but I need to drive the bus tomorrow.
