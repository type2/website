I am not an expert but have spent some time messing with big motors the last couple years. Adrian is right. If you want cheap
and more power don't go that big. Stick at the 1776 stage. You can get away with mostly stock parts in the bottom end this way.
Once you go to a stroker everything needs to be done right or you have just built yourself a time bomb. A really nice balanced
1776 should give you all the go you need for basic cruising. The other thing to keep in mind is when I had my 2110 in my crew
cab I had the biggest motor in our club but had to cruise at 55 to keep it from heating up. I am a believer in being able to
build big reliable motors, but it takes a lot of cash to do it right. If you still want to go that way I just heard that Scat is
making a nice forged crank for under $500. I have no experience with this. Just what I was told. Again as far as I know Berg
does not like full circle cranks. You must be getting Berg and Bernie BERGman mixed up. Don't! In my experience I would stay as
far away from anything Bergman as you can and buy as much Berg as you can afford. Some Berg stuff may be overbuilt and the
attitude is sometimes hard to take but their products are excellent quality. I love their pulleys.

As far as what you NEED for travel. I took my Double Cab, two friends and surf and sailing gear to Baja for a 2 week adventure
and that was with a small nut tranny and 40hp motor and I live in Washington state. I admit it is much nicer with the freeway
flyer and 1776 but it can be done and stock stuff can be easier to fix on the side of the road. This would be my recipe for a
nice travel engine on a budget: New Case, balance everything, full flow oil filter with Berg pressure relief pump cover(not bolt
on pump), counterweighted crank, 90.5 forged pistons, Total Seal rings, extra Berg oil sump, electronic ignition (Compufire or
Pertronix), and a pair of new dual Kadrons. There are a lot of blanks in this formula and again I am not an expert but this
should give you some good power without worries of overheating or taking out a second mortgage. I am sure there will be many who
will jump in on this.
hope this helps,
