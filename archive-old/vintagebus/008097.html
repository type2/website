Subject: Bug to bus tranny?

Is the center section of my '64 beetle transmission compatible with my '66
bus?
In other words, will my bug trans swap with my bus trans (center sections
only)?
I know the axles are different on the outboard ends to accomodate the redux
boxes.
What about the nosecone?
thanks for any help.
John
