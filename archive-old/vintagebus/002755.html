Subject: 9mm stem exhaust valves in SP head??

To whoever can help:

The 1975 Type I fuel injected 1600 DP engines had enlarged (9mm) valve stems and guides on the exhausts.  The valve head was downsized from 32mm to 30mm.  These changes were supposedly done to optimize the engine for the new fuel injection (anti-smog) system. Dual Port enthusiasts like to run these heads because they say they are MUCH more resistant to exhaust valve stem failure.

Has anyone tried machining a SINGLE PORT head for 9mm exhaust guides and valves??  New custom order ex. valves with 32mm heads and 9mm stems are available from TRW---I've already checked.  This combination would seem to be the &quot;ideal&quot; setup for a bulletproof bus head.  I am on a almost religious quest, since a set of meticulously maintained and adjusted re-worked heads just destroyed a brand NEW case with .010 crank and NEW cam and NEW lifters.  I can't afford for this to happen again!!

Is there enough metal around the guide area to do this in a SP head??  Has anyone tried it??  Why not??

Thanks!
