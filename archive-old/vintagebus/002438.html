I was planning to skip BOR anyway, but if Thom would like to lead a group of
us to the gate, each deciding not to enter after Thom gets turned away, I
would be happy to attend. Would probably cause a lot of confusion and
consternation at the gate, not to mention traffic tie-up. Then we could go
have a nice picnic in a park somewhere shady and cool. Brings out the old
radical in me. Opinions?
