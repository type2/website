A friend and I got to visit with the CHP guys on the way home to Phoenix
from the Pomona swapmeet last year. We towed a motorless rat bus to Pomona
in hopes of finding it a new home. Unfortunately, no one had the fever for a
rusty factory sunroofed Kombi. Mr. Man stopped me near Palm Desert and
issued a ticket for having a non-registered vehicle &quot;in operation&quot; on his
I-10. We were towing it with all four wheels on the ground via one of those
highly touted bus tow bars. If we had placed the front or rear wheels onto
one of the tow dollies then we would have been legal. The tow dolly would
have had current registration, licence plate and appropriate stop and
directional indicators.
Avoid meeting &quot;the man&quot; and get your permit(s) or trailer the thing.
