Great show, more cars and vendors than before. Listees that I saw, Matt &amp; Katie, AuFever (Karl), and Nate the sprinkler man. Only two T2 between us though, major case leak in Nate's camper kept it at home and M&amp;K had the wasserpumper. Notable busses, a RHD from New Hampshire in great shape except for rockers, had a right side washer bottle too!. Also a beautiful 21 Window from San Jose, very nice stock resto.  A few busses had bay era middle seats, Karl sold one easily for $40 including hold-downs.  My '63 DC won 3rd place in the '68 and later Type 2 custom class! Not easy to do unless an organizer puts you in the wrong category. Guess how many entries the wrong class had?

I found a set of hoops and original wood stretchers laying behind a very nice '71 DC. No seller in sight. Later in the day I found him by his truck. He's seen my DC downtown, and we struck a deal if the measurements were the same. I measured my bed and came back to measure his and 3 people had offered $50 over his asking price. He honored our deal and another VW link started. 

The hoops are short! According to the seller there was an option for cab-high tilts, probably offered post '67. This is fine with me, I like the lower look and better aerodynamics. Now to get them blasted and powdered and some canvas.
