&lt;&lt; Someone gave me an early Blaupunkt Radio today.  It can be either 6 volt 
or 12 volt I think because it has this tag on it that shows a switch in 
either a 6 or 12 position.  It is currently in the 6 position and I can't 
easily get it to move to 12.&gt;&gt;

Hi Jdd,
Is it a switch or a popcycle kind of stick you pull out and flip over before 
reinserting for the opposite voltage?  Some of the later ones have a plastic 
block one has to pull out and turn around to get the opposite voltage.  Most 
also have the same setup for reversing voltage polarity so these radios could 
be used in British cars also!

&lt;&lt;  It has both knobs and it is missing one button.  It has one button that 
has a music sign, another that says &quot;OFF&quot; and the third is missing.  Anyone 
know where I could find one of those buttons or what it said?  Am I  right 
that this is either 6 or 12 volt depending on the position of the thingy or 
is there something inside that has to be changed?  Is there anywhere I can 
look to find out a bit more about these?  &gt;&gt;

The third knob would be &quot;On&quot;.  To find a button you need to find another 
radio for parts or some radio repair place which might have spare parts 
around.  Eric&amp;Barb
