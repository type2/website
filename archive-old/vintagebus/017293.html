Anyone else in Reno for Hot August Nights?  We plan to
be swapping the next three days.************

Philip,
There is a group of VW people doing 'Hot August
Nights' this year. Hot August Nights is considered the
largest 50's,60's car cruise and show in the U.S.A.
which takes place the entire first week in August
every year.  Tuesday night was open cruising night in
Sparks and we had twelve VW's in a row down Victorian
Avenue in front of thousands of spectators.
Certainly get hold of us if you come down from Tahoe
and get together with us.

You can get hold of me at
775 322-2863 Days
Chuck Notmeyer
-Or-
Jim Becker
775 673-2185
