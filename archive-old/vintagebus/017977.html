The big red light on the dash should blink alternating from the hazard lights
aka blinker. In other words flasher outside car, then inside car, then
outside, then inside, then inside...
so if the one on your dash just turns on, the ones outside never get their
turn. not sure what that means, do your turn signals work? if your turn
signals work but not the hazards, i would think your hazard switch needs
cleaning...try removig it, cleaning all the contacts-may soldering ala Eric
and Barb's soldering technique...good luck

My hazard lights dont come on with my 67 westy. The swith light turns on but
thats all. Should the switch blink on and off? Isit the switch?or the hazard
relay, or the dreaded black box?
