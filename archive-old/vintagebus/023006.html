I've been mulling that over myself for the past couple weeks.  I still
haven't decided.

Pros: 
* I'll meet a whole buncha people that I'll never otherwise meet
* I'll finally have driven to a classic in a VW (as opposed to flying or
taking an SUV)
* I can collect on the Jon Howard Challenge Purse

Cons:
* The steering on the '60 is sloppy as a... let's just say it's sloppy, and
driving 12 hours like that would suck.
* I just started a new job.  I have no vacation time, so this trip will hit
me in the wallet work-wise.  I'd probably have to miss Friday and Monday
from work - $$.
* I dread the idea of umpteen hours at the wheel at a time.  Driving to and
from KP wore me out.  I don't know how people can do 16 hours at a stretch!
* I haven't made any prior housing arrangements for while I'm down there -
what does everyone else do?

The bus seems to be reasonably ready for such a journey.  The rear axle
seals leak, which I can't seem to get to stop.  I could swap the steering
box from the '55.  But other than that...
