Subject: Chet's trip to Washington

Hey y'all.  AS most of you know, our friends Chet and Kelley are enroute
the Seattle area from Charleston.  I was gone for part of this week in
the Keys and so was unable to update you on their progress.  Chet had a
few troubles but I think he's getting it together. Read the saga
below...

Chet:  I've been gone this week so was unable to respond.  Glad that you
found the source of the short, hope you were able to replace the wire
with no other troubles.  Good luck with new carb and if you need the
directions for carb setup let me know.
Dave

Dave, feel free to post any of the problems I have on my trip.  I will
be
doing a write-up upon completion of my trip.  I've got to flatten the
carbuerator mount today.  Runs great in the cold, and I insulated my
heater
pipe and replaced another piece of pipe coming off of the HX, and now I
smell exhaust.  New HX's on the engine, so I don't know why.  Much snow
here.  Fun to do donuts in a bus.  Happy driving--Chet

I was heading out to go xc-skiing w/my dad when my heater blower dropped
in
speed, and smoke started pouring out from under my dash.  Upon
inspection,
the wire running to my taillights from the light knob was bare due to
all
the insulation being burnt off (there used to be insulation because
there
were a few globs left here and there).  I'm running a new wire (rated to

600V) to the rear, a simple-sounding task.... it's been 5 hours now and
I
still have to hook the wire up and piece the bus back together.
Burrrrrrr,
I spend 1/3 of my time outside and 2/3 of my time indoors trying to warm
up.
  I love the snow - no, really I do.  Happy warm driving down
there--Chet


Guten Tag, Upon further inspection, it was one of my front parking
lights.
I suspect that either I got water in the lamp on the connection, or that
the
connector on the switch touched the main power input and bypassed the
switch
and so forth fried the wire.  I'm probably going to drive it to WA w/out

parking lights and rewire it there.  Funny thing is that no fuses blew.
I've got a new carb on the way (I don't trust the one on there for going

over the Rockies) and the proper connections to go from the fan to the
HX's.
  Miss you guys, wish you could be here in the snow.  Happy
driving--Chet

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
