Hi Chris
Glad to hear the 67 is being put to use.  You didn't happen to check red
gear and tranny level before you dropped them at the shop did you?
Suppose not.  After 32 years seals and stuff start to leak and you might
have had minimal fluid to start with.  I just did Chester's 67 2 weeks
ago and there was almost no fluid at all.  Mine was about half empty
when I did it last.  The seals and such do leak so the best thing to do
is seat the plugs, give everything a good wipe down, and keep an eye out
for potential leaks.

Yes, Anything I can do I'd rather do because I have more control over
the quality of the work.  If I pay someone to do something I triple
check before I leave with it.  If I do the work I tend to get less
pissed off then if someone else screwed it up.  Properly torqueing the
plugs should do the trick.  Make sure &quot;someone else&quot; didn't cross thread
them in to begin with.  Starting to sound like a dirty oily job huh?
Yeah tranny juice smelly like poopy but it's a good smell just the same.

When do I get to meet your bus?  There's a couple 67s around here now
and I think we ought to get together.  Maybe at May Be Busses or
something.

Dave
