Subject: Re: [VB]  Big nut rear axle seal question

are you sure you are talking about a big nut tranny?
the big nut trannies do not use that thick metal
washer (the one in the bearing cover between the seal
and the housing, must be put in before the seal, that
contacts the bearing race and the drum), that is early
style. that thick metal spacer wouldn't even fit over
the big nut axle. the big nut reduction box uses a
thrustwasher/spacer/oil seal that is all one unit.
for reference, you can check the samba gallery:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+106101.jpg
that is the early style. also, you must torque the
axle nut before filling the gearbox with oil to crush
the oil seal on the bearing, regardless of year of
reduction box.
how about a pic of yours. maybe that would shed some
light on all this.

&gt; The spacer I am referring
&gt; to is the big thick spacer (that is what Bentley
&gt; calls it) that contacts the
&gt; brake drum and the inner race of the roller bearing.
&gt; 
&gt; The spring is in the seal and drums are torqued.
&gt; Which direction does the
&gt; spring face, toward the drum or toward the roller
&gt; bearing?
