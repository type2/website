Subject: RE [VB] Looking for inspiration

NQ,
Now I really regret not being in town when you and Robert stopped by
last week. If only you could have seen what I have accomplished on the
Batmobile. I started the &quot;restoration&quot; of this bus with the hopes of
having a good clean splitty. Not perfect but far less likely to melt
away into a Midwest cornfield. You saw it before I started. I would have
been excited if I could have moved up to looking like crap.
Using mostly borrowed tools(VW people are MOST generous) I removed my
entire cargo floor and rockers, front floors, rear corners, both trays
in the rear and various other bits and pieces of rust and remains of
rust. I gathered up good parts for replacement and started on the
welding. With much help from Dick Bozarth the sheetmetal was put in
place. I think that was the stage it was in when you saw it last fall.
All winter I had to leave it in storage and it sat there calling my
name. It wanted to be driven but without windows you can imagine how the
windchill would have felt.
Finally this spring it came back home to my garage. Between trips out of
town I have worked on finishing the body. I did mention that I did not
expect it to be perfect didn't I? Well as a total rookie, and I mean
total, I have been able to save this Westy from total loss to what
should be without a doubt the best looking orgiginal 1965 Westfalia
SO-42 camper in West Omaha Nebraska ;) Maybe even most of Nebraska and
parts of Iowa 8)
I have looked upon your mechanical work with much envy. I know that I
will be able to travel with my bus but I'm sure you will be able to
travel with greater confidence knowing all should be well. I have done a
great deal of mechanical work but have to rely on good enough for now.
Take your time on the body work. I agree with everyone else that says it
is worth the effort. Fix L'Red's battery tray. That should give you a
little lift. 
If there is any way you can come back up here soon I know I can inspire
you. Just looking at my bus inspires me.
