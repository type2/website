Subject: Re: [VB] Stock muffer on 1776?

I agree with John, you can use a stock muffler on the 1776 like Ronnie
does.  Above 1800cc gets a bit dicey for proper exhaust flow.

OTOH, I've ran for years on my Ex-67 21 Wdw Dlx with various extractor
systems with a single quiet pack muffler without any appreciable noise
transmitted to the interior.  To be sure, yes my late father and I did
insulate the interior during while driving the beast (300,000 miles in
30 years - 3 different engines) but the caveat here is to use a
*quality* made system and muffler.  These are just getting real hard
to find now.  The last real good American -made *quality* quiet pack
system was EIE's Thunderbird and I believe they tossed in the towel a
few years back (along with 4-Tuned in Riverside, CA) because most VW
people are CHEEP (aren't we all?).  The problem with garbage being put
out by EMPI, Bugpack, Trimil, Pacesetter, etc., is that they are just
that - pure garbage and yer lucky to get one to last a year.

I always got at least 5 years out of a Thunderbird System, maybe two
or three out of a S&amp;S, all in So California.

S&amp;S in Phoenix, AZ still makes their product, and the quality is
marginally acceptable (They make a nice system for the Vanagon
Wasserboxer, but there are still reports of the muffler's lack of
longevity and quality still circulating around).

If my dusty memory serves, when the quiet pack systems were first
designed back in the 70s, the muffler blank being initally used was
from a certain year production (40-60s era) Jeep.  Now those were
built like a tank :-)

Now if yer driving a bare bones Kombi or a Panel Bus, well, even a
quiet pack muffler does generate some noise into the cabin area - best
to go with stock in this case.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts from anyone else on using a stock muffler on a 1776 engine?
&gt; Sounds like it may be a bit too small. I tend to run a little fast on the
&gt; highways. Don't want too much back pressure. The point of all this is that
I
&gt; want something a good deal quieter and keep the header look.
