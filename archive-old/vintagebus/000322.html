&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 Since I have a double door panel van, and I will be looking
 for the rearmost door on the passenger side, what is with
 low hinges? Are the doors on the windowed busses different?
  &gt;&gt;
in what mid 60 or early 61 the hinges on the cargo doors were moved.  The 
early buses have the upper one nearer the roof line, the later ones have the 
upper hinge just above the beltline.   So, if your door is mashed or rusted 
or cut up/ whatever, it is crucial to have one that will fit to replace it.   
So if your bus is a 65, the cargo doors off a 58 will not fit on it.  Ooops.  
Thus, asking for the version that fits the bus as nneeded.
