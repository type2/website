COSTCO has a website and online shopping for some items not in their stores.
I don't have the URL handy, but it should pop up in a search engine.

I've seen similar, but not as well built, shelters advertised.  The prices
were at least 50% higher than COSTCO's.

&gt;&gt; Just went to Costco to buy one of those large car shelters - garages they
had in the summer, the ones that are big enough to drive a car in.

they said they were summer only , and were sent back to make room for the
Christmas stuff........ &lt;&lt;
