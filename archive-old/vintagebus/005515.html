Hi Gang;
  if the oil system is not putting out sufficient pressure its &quot;usually&quot;
because the seat that the stock piston for the relief is &quot;peened over &quot;and
not squared off any more and should be retouched up. a stock pump puts out
200 lbs. per square inch minimum which excess pressure is relieved back into
case,but as the seat gets worn,peened or etc. and as parts get worn and
bearings get excess clearence it starts dropping in pressure.    how much
use has the engine seen since built or rebuilt.
