I've bought some HTF trinkets on there too, and I can defend it as a good
place for that.  BUT!  You need to have your cautious head on.  And
the common-sense one.  In the example of the seatbelts, the auction 
text said &quot;new&quot; - it should have occured to the guy to find out if they 
were available somewhere else.  Can't really fault him for not knowing,
and I too have been suckered the same way.  It's a learning process.

OTOH, there's still a lot of blatant misrepresentation on there.  I have
personally bought parts purported to be NOS, only to get them in my hot
little hands and find they were not.  Chrome polish does not turn back
the hands of time and magically make something NOS.  Nor does media-blasting
and rattle-canning.
