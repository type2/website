There was a barndoor ambulance kicking around for quite a while with no
takers.  The problem with an ambulance, is that it doesn't lend itself to
casual driving, like a deluxe, or any other model, for that matter.  An
ambulance would seem to be more suited to static display.  I couldn't see
myself driving it to work, but I can see myself driving my '54 deluxe.

Just my opinion; that and 50 cents will get you a cheap cup of coffee...
