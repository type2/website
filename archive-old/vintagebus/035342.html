 4) Rebuild the engine?&lt;
 **V-dub engines are like motorcycle engines.....you can rebuild the
 &quot;upper-end&quot; (ie: heads, pistons, &amp; cylinders) many times and never touch
 the crank and rod bearings.  &quot;Upper-end&quot; rebuilds give good compression but
 run hot.***
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
Unless you run a full filter system of some kind, then it is better to rebuild
the bottom end.  After so many miles and so much crud going through the
bearings you will end up with lots of power suddenly on worn out bearings and
low oil pressure.  Kind of like the first heart transplant patient.  His heart
was so worn out he could barely keep conscious from having such low blood
pressure.  Once the new heart was in, he started to bleed everywhere due the
sudden increase in pressure on the walls of his blood system that had become
use to the lower pressure.  They actually had to give him drugs to drop his
pressure and allow it to slowly come up so his body could repair and
strengthen itself.  Due to the Vw engine does not repair itself it would be
better to go all the way.   Eric &amp; Barb
