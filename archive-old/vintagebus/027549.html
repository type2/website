My 56 kombi (Then converter into a westfalia) has smooth ones.
My 57 standard has crows feet.
My old 58 singlecab had two crows, three smooth, all dated correctly.

&lt;&lt; &gt; Has anyone discovered the difference in crows foot and non crows foot 
rims? Were they just different suppliers?

I heard they (crows feet) were for commercial vehicles..................
