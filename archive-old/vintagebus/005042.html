working on putting my 1600 back together so the old girl doesnt get towed.
do i *need* one of these? or can i wing it? please reply asap, i have 36
hours to start her up to prove shes worthy of being in my driveway :).
thanks for any help.

p.s. i know youre supposed to mark the flywheel/clutch so i can line them
up. i did that, but not using the same flywheel. so alot of good that did me
:). thanks again.
