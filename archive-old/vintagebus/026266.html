&gt;  Heres the deal, on the '62 my wiper blades dont go
&gt; high enough for me. When drivin in the rain w/ the
&gt; wipers on, I have to duck way down to get where I can
&gt; see. (have to duck a little anyways, Im 6'3&quot;)
&gt;  Has anyone ever modified thier wipers to make em
&gt; reach higher? The normal response would be to get
&gt; longer wipers, but they cant be any longer on the
&gt; bottom or itll hit the body... Is there a swap out w/
&gt; a different VW wiper, or a &quot;GOOD&quot; fix that can be
&gt; done? The top part of the wiper needs to be 4 or 5
&gt; inches higher (havent actually measured it).
&gt;  Ideas.. suggestions... experience?
&gt; TIA... Later,
&gt; 

I'll bet ten dollars against a box of used exhaust donuts that you are
running early bug blades. They look the same but are shorter, and will
work on a bus. I am 6'2.5&quot; and can see fine through my wiper profile. 
What I can't see without ducking are the damn traffic lights. 
Honest, officer, I was too close to see it turn red!
