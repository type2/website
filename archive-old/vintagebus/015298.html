Hello all,
  I was doing some reading in an old Magazine(kit
car or street Rodder?) Anyway they were doing
some blasting of chrome parts but were using
baking soda and not sand. They said that the soda
did not harm the chrome but would strip off paint
and other stuff to reveil just the chrome. They
also used it on aluminum, and some other softer
stuff. It looked like it would work real good. I
think they just used a normal sand blaster. The
question I have is, were do you get bulk baking
soda, and has anyone ever tried this before?
  I think it would work good for cleaning vintage
parts like door handles, pot metal parts, rear
veiw mirrors, and other stuff.
  When I find the mag. I will try to scan the
artical for the list, if interested.
