Subject: RE: [VB] engine stand question

I agree. Having used both styles of stands (and
the mobile VW-specific stand), I would favor the
sturdier unit (link below) over the
single-wheeled model. Easier to roll around and
feels much more solid.

&gt; Best solution would be something a little bit

&gt; and have a couple of different pivots/mounts
&gt; for it so you have flexibility
&gt; to do different jobs:)  In defense of the
&gt; single front wheel I have actually
&gt; built up a 429 Cadillac engine on the stand I
&gt; have although it is a little
&gt; better quality than the one HF has.

&gt; Yes, it will sorta work if you use a later bell
&gt; housing. But you can't split
&gt; the case very well. The one you linked to is
&gt; very scary to use with the one
&gt; wheel on the end. You are better off spending a
&gt; little more for more
&gt; stability. This one is double the price but
&gt; safer to use:
