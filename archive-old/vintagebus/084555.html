Subject: Re: [VB] Wipers Again

 my first bus , a 59, was 12V witha 6V wiper motor.   it was fine for a while, then it'd wipe so fast the linkage would come apart at the ball and socket and I'd have to move the linkage manually.  Then I put a voltage drop in.
 
Here in the PNW with the rain being light, slow wipers are nice.  It would be nice to have an even slower speed too, for the times it's between a drizzle and a heavy mist.   
 
Your wiper needs are probably infuenced by your climate.   When I lived in the bay area, when it rained, it rained harder, but not as often.
