Subject: HO case 1500 engine

This may be a question of personal taste, but I have an opportunity to get
an HO case, a 1500 engine, for a reasonable price, or so I believe.  The
owner claims it is  rebuilt.
Okay, so lets say it is.
My question, is there any reason why I would not want to put a 1500 DP in  a
split window?
How about mounting?  Will I need to tap any holes for a mustache bar or
mounts or anything for a 71?  What about fitting it in a 66 or 60?? Anything
that will dissuade me from the acquisition?

Beep Beep,
