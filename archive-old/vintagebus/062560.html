Hi all,

I'd like to get in contact with anyone in the Midwest or Mideast U.S.A. a=
reas, or southern central Canada, who owns and occasionally displays any =
type or model of VW based fire equipment, ambulance, &quot;catastrophe&quot; respon=
se vehicle, staff car, etc.  If you, or someone you know, has and enjoys =
showing any VW version of the above emergency service equipment, could yo=
u please either send me their e-mail and phone contact info, or please pa=
ss this request on to them so that they might respond to me.  All I can s=
ay right now is that an event that will &quot;special feature&quot; all eras and mo=
dels of these rare VW vehicles is currently being formulated.  Thanks for=
 any help you can provide.  This should be fun, and we want to involve as=
 many of these vehicles as possible.  As things are firmed up, details wi=
ll follow.
