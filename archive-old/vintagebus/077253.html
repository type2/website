Subject: Re: [VB] 241 walk through

My 65 Deluxe is not a walk thru but has mount points
for a 2/3 middle seat.  No apparent M code stating it
though.  

I ended up putting a full length seat in there though
because i could not locate a 2/3 for the life of me. 
I had extra mount plates so i welded them in.  now i
can accept both styles although my floor mat is only
for the full length set-up.

For what it's worth, I have a '63 15 window.  Here are
the M-Codes:

- 424 - unknown, package?
- 081 - walk-through cab (microbus and deluxe - LHD)
- 114 - six opening side windows (export)
- 130 - microbus deluxe without sliding roof or roof
windows

This Bus will not take a 2/3 middle bench - it lacks
the necessary 
holes 
in both of the middle hold down plates that are welded
to the floor 
(plates are there - no holes).  Plus, the original
rubber mat does not 
have holes for a 2/3 bench's passenger side mounts.

I have had several people try to tell me that
something is wrong with 
my 
Bus, that ALL walk-throughs came with 2/3 middle
benches so you could
