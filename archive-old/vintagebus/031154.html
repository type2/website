You don't need a special tool to remove the upper inner reduction box
bearing for an axle swap. The bearing will slide off the end of the axle
with the inside half of the reduction gear box and axle tube. You can
then easily knock it out of the housing by sticking something like a
broomstick down the axle tube. 

I'd say the chances of that tranny being good are slim. You just never
know, it could be good, but I don't like to do tranny installations
enough to gamble on a used one. You might enjoy spending a lot of time
like that. That's your call. 8^)

&gt; The yard claims this bus sat 15 years inside in CA, and now sat two years
&gt; outside in PA. What are my chances that the
&gt; redux boxes and trans really are good?
