Subject: Re: [VB] what year is my bus?

My 1959 Subhatch is an SO-23.  I would assume that's
what yours should be.  As far as common, I've seen
others...

JP

&gt; Question #2: This bus has what you refer to as a
&gt; 'subhatch' on it. What SO-?? is
&gt; this supposed to be?
&gt; Question #3: Are these fairly common?
