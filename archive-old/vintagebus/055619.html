Subject: Re: [VB] New Member, but I got here as fast as I could...

The single cab is located on Rte. 10 in Succasunna, New Jersey (western 
Morris County - about 1hr from New York City).  Easy to get there from/off 
Route 80.  On the westbound side of Rte 10 there is &quot;10 West&quot; car care center 
located between Eyland and Hillside Aves.  It sits out front right along Rte. 
10 and has a 63 beetle for sale next to it.  Let me know if you need better 
directions.  Good Luck.
