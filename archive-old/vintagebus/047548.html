I wanted to plug the VDO holder for mounting gauges in the parcel tray.  On

my '63, the opening in the parcel tray is just the right size to fit one of

these in.  No holes to trill or anything, just the pressure from the rubber

between the parcel tray top/bottom holding it in.  Perfect fit.  Just the

right amount of pressure without hurting tray.

I mounted a pair of guages in the parcel tray of my 65 westy.  I screwed the
bracket up into the bottom of the dash- there was a factory looking hole there
already, and then put the guages in.  It is tilted to the left a tad, and I
can see it fine.   Hooked the guage lights into the headlight switch terminal
with the other dash lights.   The stereo is mounted under the tray under the
guages.
