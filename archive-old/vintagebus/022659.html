Even though a lot of &quot;calendar&quot; time has not elapsed, the M/C could still
be bad.  I also don't see hoses in your list of parts - you should have
replaced them.  The symptom seems like a classic bad m/c - the fluid will
flow back past the piston and into the reservoir.

Did you adjust before you bled?  

I just did all the brakes on the 59 I mean 60 panel yesterday.

&gt;I have done the following:
&gt;Rotors turned
&gt;Inner/outer bearings
&gt;New brake shoes
&gt;New cyl (all 4 of them)
&gt;
&gt;Now that I have done everything, I can not get pressure to hold on the brake
&gt;line.  The first two pumps go all the way to the floor, and the third time
&gt;it catches and the bus stops very nicely.  I have bled the brakes 3 times
&gt;and still have the same problem.  This was never a problem before (it used
&gt;to go down about 2/3 of the way and just would not stop).  According to the
&gt;maint records I  received last summer the M/C was replaced 7K miles ago
&gt;(although that was ~5 years ago in actual time).
