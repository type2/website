Subject: BYOB/KP

   Well I'm back. BYOB was a kick. It was probally 3 times bigger then last
year and was one heck of a swap and show. Fun was had by all and I was
amazzed at all thet did show up.
   After all the scare tactics of KP, everything there was smooth as silk, I
got lucky and got there early and 
 was the first swap guy in, followed by a few friends then Rustybus and the
PLF high roof. It was a great day there with lots of cool swaps finds had by
all. Some really great scores seemed to be had by all and then all the
BS'ing with friends was great.
   The drive was uneventful in my DD, cruised right along at 70/75 MPH
getting an average of 18 MPG, no bad winds this year helped and going solo I
set a quick pace, gotta love the 1800.
