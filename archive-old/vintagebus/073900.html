&gt; Do I get credit for the stuff that I will NEVER get out from under my 
&gt; fingernails ??

Hi Diane,
If you work some hand goop under your mails before doing greasy work the dirt 
will work out alot easier and using vinyl gloves helps alot.

&gt; Took it to the new guy .. he used some sort of electric tool .. he said 
&gt; that was &quot;his hammer.&quot;  It was on there for good ... The steering wheel 
&gt; straighted somewhat but he told me to take it immediately to the only place he knows 
&gt; that can do the front end [toe in??] .. The one and only person there that 
&gt; does the buses won't be back until Monday.

Hopefully when the drag link end was reinstalled it was greased to help 
prevent it from sticking so much.  You can easily do the work on establishing toe 
in by pulling out your &quot;Idoit's Guide&quot; by John Muir.  You really do need to get 
the Bentley Shop Manual for the 1963-67 VW bus!!!!

&gt; He drove the bus .. said he was shocked that I was driving it with the 
&gt; steering THAT BAD .. said the clutch needs to be adjusted because it grinds in 
&gt; each gear if you aren't very careful and slow to shift.  Said the brakes also 
&gt; need adjustment because [can't remember his exact words] but there is no room 
&gt; to press down.  They don't give .. or they are stiff .. or maybe all those 
&gt; things ...

Clutch is easy, brakes are easy to adjust, but make sure to check that the 
master cylinder and the brake pedal push rod has about 1/32&quot; or .030&quot; or 1mm 
space beteen them or the brakes will just get tighter and tighter as you use them 
and burn the brake pads up!!!!!  All because the brake fluid pressure can not 
be relieved back into the brake fluid reseviour.

&gt; Said the engine is racing and should be adjusted .. that I need to be 
&gt; careful to not run it hot and to get some sort of gauge for the temp.  I had one 
&gt; in my 71 bus .. the mechanic from hell disconnected it .. said it was 
&gt; unnecessary .. I should have removed it from the bus then ..


You might be able to adjust that or it might need a new set of properly sized 
jets in it.  Oil pressure and oil temp are real engine lifesavers!!

&gt; That's about it.  Maybe I can do the clutch or brakes or adjust the racing 
&gt; myself this weekend ?? Mean while, I am going to call around .. there MUST be 
&gt; someone else that can do the front end ..

All stuff you can do or at least take a swing at this weekend.
