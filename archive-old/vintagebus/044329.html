Subject: '59 Kombi...engine trouble

On the way home from work today, my engine started giving me trouble. 
Basically seems like it's either missing or not getting steady fuel. 
After it cools down I'm gonna change the fuel filter. Not sure the 
best plan of attack after that. Everything &quot;looks&quot; fine. All cables 
and plugs are where they should be. All tune-up parts have about 1300 
miles on them. Engine wouldn't hold an idle. My quick fix to get it 
from driveway to garage was to slightly advance the disty so it'd 
stay going...and to give me a chance to take a look at it running.

Any advice on where to start...small problems to big 
problems......would be great. Thanks.
