Subject: 40 Horse flywheel

I think i know the answer, but am posing the question just the same.
Is there a way to make the 40 H a 12-volt ?
I assume that if the crank is cut for a non o-ring flywheel , you are
limited to the 6-volt 180mm flywheel and will just have to leave it
and run the 6-volt starter at double speed on a 12-volt battery,
since a 0-ring flywheel won't fit. Are there any 12-volt flywheels
made to fit a non o-ring crank ?

What is the correct arrangement of modifications
to fit the later 12-volt IRS trans ?
1. Remove the release bearing centering tube ?
2. Change the clutch operating fork and use the early release bearing
    to match the 3-finger / 6-spring clutch cover ?
3. Exchange the 12-volt starter bushing for the 6-volt adapter.
