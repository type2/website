Looks like it 'could' be a partial and mangled late
`56-`58 Westfalia Deluxe export interior, but then
again it does not....like the woodman said would need
better pics of the interior...if its a westy you gotta
BIG headache lookin for those missing pieces...almost
impossible.  If it ain't westy you might be better
off.

Are those factory safaris???  iF so NiCeeeeee!!!  Give
ya a piece of chese for 'em! :-)

&gt; Pretty Cool Matt!
&gt;             Very interesting! I  am not sure if it
&gt; is a Westfalia.It looks
&gt; more like a E-Z camper ( I say that because of the
&gt; cabinet in the
&gt; foreground),or a mix and match home set up.Maybe
&gt; somebody modified a
&gt; Westy.But!! Some brighter pics of the interior would
&gt; help!!! Do the cushions
&gt; unattach and how?? Is there a closet just inside the
&gt; cargo doors?What kind
&gt; of wood would you say it is?Oak? Pine?Birch!!?? What
&gt; do the back cabinets
&gt; look like?Is there original material under the
&gt; Hawaiian stuff? No curtain
&gt; rods? Any propane appliances? Does it smell German
&gt; in there?haha.It's cool
&gt; whatever it is.
