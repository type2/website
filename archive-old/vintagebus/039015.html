Subject: Stock Tire Diameter in Inches

&gt;I'm not trying to start another tire thread, but does anyone know 
&gt;the tire diameter for the stock 14&quot; rims in inches. I checked the 
&gt;archives, but came up empty handed. I think the bug is 24.5&quot;, is 
&gt;that roughly the same for a bus? I'm trying to pin down why my 

I know this isn't exactly what you're asking, but I thought it might be
helpful.  To determine the approximate height of any radial tire, here's the
formula:

width = 1st number on the tire size (in mm) x .0394(convert to inches).  
So a 205/70/14 is:  205mm x .0394 = 8.08 inches wide.  
Note:  this is the widest part of the tire, not the tread width.

height = (width x aspect ratio x 2 x .0394(convert to inches)) + rim height.

So a 205/70/14 is:  (205 x .70 x 2 x .0394) + 14 = 25.31 inches high.

Tires without an aspect ratio (ie. 165/15) are USUALLY considered to be 78
series tires (although I've heard that some may be 80 series).
So a 165/15 is:  (165 x .78 x 2 x .0394) + 15 = 25.14 inches high.

So, that being said, you must bear in mind that every brand and every model
of tire varies substantially since there are no definitive regulations on
tire sizing.  I recently replaced a set of Yokohama 195/60/15 tires on my
914 with a different (better) set of Yokohama 195/60/15 tires.  The new ones
are at least an inch wider and a 3/4 inch shorter than the old ones even
though they show the same size.

Another interesting observation is that thinner, stiffer tires (ie. narrow
LT tires) will often result in better gas mileage because they have less
rolling resistance.
