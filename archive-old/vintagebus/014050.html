Seems like there is a lot of interest in the pan seals. Although I have been
told that W Wolf. West carries the seals, their internet site says otherwise.
I will try to call them tomorrow and find out.

I would prefer to buy from someone on the list..ie bus depot or volkswerks?
sorry is there anyone else i forgot?

I'll keep you posted.
