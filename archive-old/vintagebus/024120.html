Subject: Muffler! muffler!  who's got a muffler?

Doesn't that just read funny?
I thought so.

Well, time to buy Bussie a new muffler and I thought I'd ask for some
opinions. Come to think of it, I've actually never had to buy a muffler
for any of my vehicles.  

Anyway, the 67's engine is a stock H-series &amp; currently has some
loopy-shaped extractor (great technical description, huh?) &amp; a dual
chamber(?) Bugpack hunk-o-rust attached. I have heard some interesting
things about this extractor design and think I'd like to replace it w/
the same but am considering something other than Bugpack mufflers. I'd
like to hear of other options.
I know that for many street motorcycles there are lots of different good
aftermarket exhaust systems because what usally comes stock is
crapola... what about for busses?
Hope everyone had a great time at Jerome - Next year I am definately
going! It sounds like a lot of fun &amp; partly heaven!
