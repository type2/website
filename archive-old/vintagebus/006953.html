I don't know if I really should have said anything, I WAS one of those
flower power, reject society, love peace and freedom people years (25+) ago,
cruising in my 69 (good number back then) westy along with my friend in his
late 50's sundial, but now I've conformed (all the rejection I got back
then) have a business, wife, 2 lovely children, still drive a bus, sans the
flower power, geatful dead (wasn't no Phish back then)bumper stickers, no
more LoVe beads and petuli(?) oil, listen to jazz and grunge music with some
country on the side and do my best to help any and all people with or
without a bus, I guess we all grow up and become somebody, but you have to
experience life also.

ronnie     hip but no hippy and never been called a Yuppie

ps. my other HIPPY friend and co hart went on to be a wealthy nursery man,
guess he never could get the flower power out of his heart.

OK, now Craig's prolly feelin' like a Fatcat Capitalist Piggie after
pokin' fun at certain kinds of people.  And that viewpoint's been told
off by Charlie, Poor Richard, and Ronnie in ways that I can't argue
with.

The folks Ronnie describes are wonderful people, though sometimes ya
gotta tell your left brain to shutthef*ckup long enough so you can hear
what they're saying.  OTOH there are irresponsibles in that (and any)
crowd who can give 'em a bad name.  Folks, be open and loving but
scrutinize the hell outta anyone who's coming inside your house.  OTOH,
be HIGHLY suspicious whenever any group that rejects Modrin Material
Culcha is being satirized or lampooned.  Plays right into the hands of
The Man, who most certainly exists, thank you.

But what fascinates me is how this Filthy Hippies / Sweet Flower
Children dichotomy still resonates after 30+ years, and what a
singularly appropriate forum in which to have it happen.

And danged if it didn't push me off the vintage resto / hippie bus
fence.  Where's that house paint?
