&lt;&lt; The Bentley talks about a conglomeration of reaming, bushings, seals,

Hi NQ,
That sounds like it is refering to the 1964, and earlier suspension.  
Especially due to the mention of reaming.  The pre-1964 front suspension used 
two phenolic type bushings for each trailing arm.  The 1964 used only one of 
these on each arm on the inner side, and the needle bearings on the outside.  
Then for 1965-67 only needle bearing were used.  
We were just given some trailing arms from a 1961 bus last week.  There was 
some wear on the upper sides of these where they ride against the bushings.  
Was wondering if one was rebuilding one of the pre-1965 suspensions if it 
would be a good idea to switch trailing arms from side to the other side.  
Also wondering if this would be a good idea for 1964-67 trailing arms.  As 
far as we could tell from the trailing arm we got last week, and our parts 
manual it looks like there is no left or right only on these parts.
