What you said was true but rather in reverse. A few
years ago I met a former Dealership service manager
from that era. Richard Toy, of the now defunct Toy's
Import Auto Parts, Mesa, AZ told me a few stories
about &quot;back in the day&quot;.  According to Dick, the late
50's early 60's it was real popular to go camping
regardless what make or model of vehicle. 
Also, Westfalia campers were the most expensive VW
TypeII product (deluxes were second) and were in high
demand. He said that at this point in time VWOA had
literal warehouses filled with commercial buses due to
the lack of sales. He mentioned Florida as one site.
The factory leveraged (stuck) the dealerships with a
given number of slow selling commercial buses to gain
their allotment of the sought after Westfalias. 
Dick also said that some of the American camper
convesion kits arrived at his dealership with all of
the parts strapped to pallets with detailed install
descriptions. I can't really see dealerships taking
the time and patience to assemble a kit to that
extent.
Have seen evidence of the camping craze in several of
the Foreign Car Digest 'featuring vws' magazines from
59-65 which contain many articles about how to hack
you buses into campers. This magazine was partially
the muse for the Rusty VanBondo cartoons that I drew
at one point.
