At a recent car show (Bug-O-Rama, CA) a fella was selling a 3/4 middle seat that
he described as being _'67_only_.  A year ago I bought a full length middle
seat for my 67 deluxe walk-thru and all clamps lined up.  Was I lucky and got
a 67 seat?  I also pulled a 3/4 middle seat from a 70s bay window and all clamps
pretty much line up too, give or take 1/2&quot;.
