Hi!

Vol 1.2 of the Barndoor Buffs magazine (in English) is out NOW. 
Only for members... Will you resist any longer?....

You'll find: 
- a M codes list
- the index of every IVVM / the VW Old-Timer Magazine article featuring a 
barndoor
- an article about the numerous ways to cool a barndoor (Behr, Safaris, pop 
out, slits, crotch coolers, Golde sunroof, rotary fans...)
- Ribenrinho toys
- press review: articles featuring a barndoor (in VolksWorls, HotVWs, Super 
VW Magazine...) since index had been published in vol 1.1
- a Binz brochure repro
- Hanover 50th report
- classified
- 10 or 15 more pages of our reprint of parts #s with drawings (workshop 
manual to begin in vol 1.3)

Can you still resist being a Barndoor Buffs member?
If not please send the form you surely have to Sébastien CORNE, the president.
Don't forget we can't accept international cheques because one quarter of the 
sum goes in taxes! Please send cash (French Francs or anything else...)
Many thanks

Christian PRUVOT
