&gt; Then all the bus restorers will move onto the next crave wave, start
buying up those early Rabbits.
&gt;
Make that early Sciroccos or that 1-owner, low mileage '83 GTI that has
&quot;never been redlined&quot; and you got something there.  There are already insane
amounts of people all over the water-cooled VWs.  People with 10 A1
Sciroccos in their yard and talk of sets of Recaros that are &quot;perfect&quot;.

Pardon me while I go work on restoring my limited production, OG paint,
Rabbit Turbo Diesel truck.  Will trade for similar-condition ribbed bumper
23-window or side-loader Single Cab.  ;)
