&gt; &gt; Please re-explain what you do with the plastic bag? You &quot;lubricate&quot; the wheels
&gt; &gt; with the plastic bag? I dont get it... Is the bag used between the rear wheel
&gt; &gt; well and the rubber of the tire to get it to squeeeeeeze past the fender?
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, I use it so the rubber doesn't hang up so much on the metal.  The
&gt; double layer of plastic helps it slide in.
&gt;
&gt; On the fronts of an early bus there are no clearance issues.  On a later
&gt; one you have to beat the jackpoint ridges out of the way with a bigass
&gt; hammer.

Wouldn't it be easier to just use the proper tires?  :)
