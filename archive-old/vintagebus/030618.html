&gt;looking for used or nos seat upolstery, drivers kick panel, and middle/rear
seat kick panels for the 56. dont  have much cash, but lots for trade. 
&gt;
Dammmmmmn, nice set of Buses!

I'm curious, I've never really heard of someone buying or selling NOS seat
upholstery, was this really available or did you have to buy a whole seat
back in the day?

I know Greg Noble has some NOS door panels on his '57 Standard, ooooh, pretty.

Everett
'55 Kombi - An NOS 6-leg middle seat would be acceptable
