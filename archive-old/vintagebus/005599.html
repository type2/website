Subject: Hose to Oil Bath Air Cleaner

hey ya list


So I have an oil bath air cleaner and a 28 PICT - it's been quite cold
lately - 27 below Celsius today - burrrrr - and things haven't been running
too smoothly. Carb icing I guess.  So today I'm trying to figure out where
that hose terminates that comes from the oil bath air cleaner.  I guess I
have the wrong engine tin because there isn't a hole for that hose to pass
through.  There is, what looks to be a knock-out but that's on the wrong
side of the engine - its on the battery side.  So I drilled a hole in it
approximately where the Bentley manual shows it, actually I drilled a number
of small holes and filed it all smooth. I hooked up the hose to the air
cleaner and now I don't know where it is supposed to terminate.  That hose I
have seems a little long.

I use this Coleman naphtha heater in my bus when I'm driving, this thing
wouldn't tip in a million years, I think it is very safe.  I have this
propane one that I use in the back but I always turn it off before I move my
bus. Anyway, the naphtha heater never seems to get my bus warm when it is 20
below, but it seems to take a bit of the bite out of the cold.  My feet
don't seem to get as cold as without it.  So today I got this big mutherin'
piece of card board, two of them actually, and I fit it as a divider between
the cab and the back of my bus. I got it to fit really well, it fits really
tight.  I cut a hole in the middle of the cardboard and taped some poly to
it to form a little window.

I'm quite excited.  I'm thinking the bus should run really well now with the
hose running to the air cleaner, as soon as I can figure out how it
terminates.  And I also think my cardboard divider should keep the heat in
from the ol' naphtha heater.  With all of this fresh snow skiing tomorrow
should be GREAT!!!
