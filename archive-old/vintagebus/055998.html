Subject: RE: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto

Being in business for myself, $50 is cheap.  Consider your building costs,
heat, electricity, tools, taxes, workmans comp, more taxes, employee issues,
materials, etc. etc. etc.... oh, and more taxes!  Most body guys I know
won't do any kind of resto work because there is absolutely no money in
it... collision and insurance claims is where they can at least make a wage.
