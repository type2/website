Subject: Calling all NW Vintage Bus Owners - unique show coming soon!

Hey all,

I'm a Corvair guy, but I'm got Bus Content!

On the weekend of September 15th through the 17th Western Canada CORSA is
holding an all AIR COOLED car event in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia.

Friday the 15th is a Cruise In (with live band) at Francellis
Saturday the 16th is a Host BBQ (we feed you) and then a cruise around the
Saanich Penninsula
Sunday the 17th is the most unique car show you'll ever have a chance to be
a part of!  We are actively seeking the participation of Franklins, Cords,
VWs, Subarus, Tatras, Citroens, Porsches, the myriad German Micro-Cars on
top of the typical 50 Corvairs that attend our event.

Please spread the word far and wide, and we look forward to seeing you
there!

For more information on the show go here:

Regards,
