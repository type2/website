Is anyone in or around Houston driving out to the CA for the Classic weekend that might have room for one more? OR is anyone planning on driving through HOuston and wouldn't mind picking me up? I really want to go but can't afford to fly, don't want to drive by myself (don't think my bus would make it that far) Was supposed to rent a car with a group of friends but they are slowly dropping out.....
Anyone? I can drive out to meet someone... Rex? Would prefer to ride in a Bus...Rex?
Thanks,
Brian
