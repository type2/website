Could be.  I'm not saying that his device won't work, but the amount of
hydrogen and oxygen produced wouldn't amount to much compared to the
amount of air that is drawn into the carb.  A pump shouldn't be needed
to move the oxygen/hydrogen mixture, as it would move to the carb as
fast as it is produced.

&gt;From a safety aspect, I wouldn't want to have very much stochiometric
oxygen/hydrogen mixture around my car.  One spark and that PVC
container would be in splinters all over the engine compartment, along
with the battery acid solution that was contained within it.  A
colleague was once unlucky enough to have a test tube with a similar
H2/O2 mixture go off in his hand.  Despite the end being completely
open, the test tube was instantly converted to hundreds of tiny glass
shards.

I still cannot see any way that this device can produce more energy
than it consumes.  I don't want to poo-poo innovation, but in this case
there doesn't seem to be any.

&gt; &gt;The electrical energy required to disassociate hydrogen and oxygen
&gt; from
&gt; &gt;water is equal to the energy released when you combine the hydrogen
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;oxygen in your engine.  It's called robbing Peter to pay Paul.

&gt; &gt;I'm not rushing out to buy PVC pipe!
