Just a quick email for those that are not on our mailing list.  We send out 
parts specials from time to time via email to people on our mailing list 
since the &quot;lists&quot; are not for selling/commercial purposes.  We're running a 
sale on Weber carbs right now and will have another TMI sale within the next 
couple of weeks.  If you'd like to be put on our list, please email me 
directly at &lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:wolfsdenvw_at_aol_dot_com&quot;&gt;wolfsdenvw_at_aol_dot_com&lt;/A&gt;.  If 
you have been put on our list, but your email address has changed, please let 
us know.  I've been receiving a lot of &quot;returned&quot; emails.  Sorry for waste of 
bandwidth for those who are not interested in this message.  Thanks.
