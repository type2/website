I spent 5 hours trouble shooting this gas guage problem and it just goes to
prove even further why I hate electrical work.  You can work for hours and
have little or nothing left to show for it.

The first thing I did was did out my 1967 bus fuel guage and meticulously
removed the bezel.  Well the plastic ring fell out from under the bezel in a
jillion pieces and I ended up beating up the bezel pretty bad just trying to
reinstall it.  I've the one from the 66 that could go on this one and make
nice ebay fodder.  Nah, I'm hanging on to it.  :-)  I was not satisfied with
how the 67 guage looked and besides, the Royale VDO guage I got is supposed
to work with a baywindow fuel sender.  I laid the 67 guage aside and started
working with what I had.  After trouble shooting everything and getting
nowhere, I removed the guage and then (get ready for this one) jigsawed a
nice square hole above the sending unit so I wouldn't have to pull the tank.
I wrestled with the idea of not cutting into my bus but it's no show queen
and I'm modifying it for updated personal use so with firm determination, I
proceeded with a twinge of guilt. :-)  With the sender pulled and the guage
laying back there, I hooked it all up and got nothing.  I was getting no
readings at all from the guage which was exactly how it acted before I
rebuilt it last October.  After disassembling it, I found massive corrosion
(from sitting without being dowsed in fuel) which wouldn't allow the cork to
float.  In just a matter of minutes I broke the sender wire and found some
grounding problems at the little stud I put in place of a rivet in the top
of the guage.  As it turns out  I was able to clean up the corrosion,
resolder the wire, fix the grounding problem, and bingo - my sender was
giving out variable resistance values.  I hooked it back up to the guage and
it worked perfectly - full range top to bottom.  I installed everything and
then it didn't work again.  I hate it when that happens.  So out it all came
again.  I tested the sender wire and it was good all the way from front to
back with no shorts.  I had a good source of 12v to the guage so I started
checking my grounds.  The little bolt that holds the ground on the sending
unit had some POR15 under its head and this prevented a good solid ground so
I cleaned the bolts up spic and span.  On the guage, I had merged the ground
wire from the bulb to the ground for the guage and detected some problems
with that arrangement so 2 seperate ground wires were run to the parcel tray
bolt on the driver's side.

The only other problem I had after this was I thought I had a full tank of
gas and the guage read just barely above empty.  The other side effect of
using a splitty filler nozzle on a baywindow tank is that the lower angle of
the filler tube makes gassing up a slow function.  I'll have to drip it in
in order to get a full tank.

So the fuel guage is working and I also installed the voltage regulator I
had removed in anticipation of my alternator conversion.  I'm just going to
put the 1600 back in so I can drive the bus around a little bit while I'm
waiting on these carb parts for the 1776.  Right now, I'm waiting for my
brother to show up here at home so I can have some help lifting the 1600
into the trailer so I can go powerwash it.  I'm also going to do the cargo
mat and front floor mat while I'm in the happy splashy sort of mood.  Maybe
tomorrow I'll go on my real first cruise in the bus (as in get it on the
highway.)

Later...
