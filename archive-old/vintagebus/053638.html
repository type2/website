Subject: RE: [VB] Vent windows!

Hi Kevin,

Been there, done that... patience is a virtue and so is a liberal amount of
soap.

David

&gt;&gt;&gt;Workin' on changing door seals on my 63', and made the (mistake?) attempt
to
change the seals that border the vent window to the vent window frame.  Boy
o boy, lotsa fun!  I had new locks to put in, and cracked the lock in my
attempt.  I have it rigged enough to the point that if I can get the window
completly in the frame, it should hold.

The problem is, IF I can get the window COMPLETLY in the frame!  Right now I
have it about 98% there, but it won't budge.  I have given it a rest for the
night, thinking maybe after a nights rest, it will be more coperative.
