Subject: Double cab gas tank and cargo bed

Hi list!

Found a '67 DC a few days ago and &quot;drove&quot; it home last night.  Fortunately
a pretty short trip, as the bus really wasn't driveable (the PO told me it
was, but....).  Amongst other things, it needs a complete mechanical
overhaul, and judging from the 180 degrees of play in the sterring wheel,
some front end work.
Also, the floor of the bed has been mostly cut out, and the gas tank
appears to have been replaced with something much more creative than the
original.

My questions are:  1) Is the sheet metal for the bed available for purchase
someplace; 2) did the DC have a unique style gas tank, and 3) if it has a
unique gas tank does anybody know where I can get one?

For both of the above, I could probably have something fabricated, but I
was hoping to keep it as original as possible.

Thanks!
