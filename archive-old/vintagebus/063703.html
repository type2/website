Subject: The more you get rid of the more you find....

I just can't win!!!!

Today my '59 Kombi was finally picked up by the new owner. So now 
it's gone for good. It'll be driving around the US then shipped back 
to the U.K. The guys have the AIRS list, so if they call on you, help 
'em out....real nice guys.

Then today I followed a lead and found (2) Double Door busses!!! 
They've been there a LONG time. He says ones a '58 and ones a '57. 
Don't know for sure. They are early ones though. Here's pictures:

Take a look at the wheels on the second one and it'll give you an 
idea how long it's been there! The first is the one I want. It's 
pretty straight and not rusted. The second has rusted rockers and 
lower doors. Both would be nice....BUT.....he tells me he's got (2) 
old trucks back on the farm!!!! Gotta go see those. Amazing how VW's 
show up like this when you least expect it. He says if he decides to 
sell he'll have to figure out what to do with all the parts in the 
panels. They're packed to the roof with stuff as usual.
