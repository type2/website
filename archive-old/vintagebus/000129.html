&lt;&lt; Hi Eric and Barb, 
   I'm in the process of redo-ing the bolts on the spring plate - reduction 
gear boxes and have been following your advice on the Vintage Bus list. There 
are 2 bolts that were stripped and the others can only be torqued down to 
50ft/lbs.&gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
First if the other bolts will only torque to 50ft. lbs. the holes they are in 
are stripped.

&lt;&gt;
Well we suggest not using heli-coils in areas that you have to take apart 
regularly.  Instead you should see if you can send back the heli-coils, and 
installation kit.  Then call Time-Sert and get thier repair kit for the 
12X1.5 holes.  They have a short solid insert for this, but if you talk to 
the company reps they should have a longer (35mm?) special order one.  These 
solid inserts actually have a locking system so they stay in the hole instead 
of coming out when removing the bolt like heli-coils do too often.
 
&lt;&lt;The bolts that I got are roughly the same size.  I read that you found out 
that it was better to drill out and put ÿa larger bolt i.  Question is how 
much larger?  What do you use to center the tap so it goes in straight?&gt;&gt;
Do you mean the bolt that you have now are about the same length, are you 
asking how much longer bolts do we have?  We use bolts that are about, or a 
little shorter than 40mm measured in the shaft, not including the head.  
Drill the holes bigger using a HSS drill, and make sure to use very light 
pressure while boring the holes bigger.  The drill bit will have a huge 
tendance to grab the little bit of material, and then break the drill bit.  
Needs to be done with a very slow drill motor.  You might be better off 
having a local machine shop do the drilling.  Then with a small square, or 
make a square out of cereal box cardboard check the tap once it starts to 
bite into the steel of the reduction boxes twice at 90 degrees from each 
other.  If the tap is tilted a bit you just lean it the proper way while 
turning it in a little more, and recheck with the square again.

&lt;&lt;Any advice on using the Heli-Coil?&gt;&gt;
 Like we said, best not to!  Solid inserts are far better, and especially in 
this area.  If any of the threaded holes you have are in still good shape 
definitely drill them deeper, and use a 12X1.5 intermediate tap, and/or 
possibly a bottoming tap.  Bottoming tap only if you have one, or two holes 
to do.  It is just alot easier to do the work, and less chance of over 
stressing the tap, and breaking it, if you use a intermediate, and then the 
bottoming tap to get the threads completely cut virtually all the way down 
the holes.  Also remember once you have the tap cut a few turns firmly in the 
metal to start doing a half turn in, and a whole turn back out, then turn 
back until it hits the spot where it stopped cutting, and repeat, over, and 
over.  This keeps the tap from getting bound up, and broken with long metal 
shavings, by breaking the shavings into short pieces.  Above all do not 
forget to use some oil, or better yet tap cutting fluid on the tap for each 
hole, and only use HSS taps!

 &lt;&lt;Thanx's for all the tips, and BTW which is it Eric or Barb? &gt;&gt;
Mostly Eric, but sometimes Barb.   
Keep On, VWing, Eric&amp;Barb
