Subject: re:computer programs

If you go to the trouble of getting microsoft office-try to get it with
Access. I think if you get MS Office, you need the full version for this to
be included. By full I do not mean non-academic, just that it is the full
suite. Access is a database program.

The absolutely truly best way to inventory things is with a database. I
could elaborate more on this if you guys are interested, but don't want to
waste the bandwidth if there is no interest....let me know.
