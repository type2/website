 Think Ronnies wrong on that one Lou. I'm using a 15 gal tank from a FI
motor in my 63 panel. Guess who I got it from?? Ronnie. I welded up 1 of the
bottom 2 lines , forgot which 1 now but it is obvious and ran the top vent
line up to the filler neck with vented gas cap and plugged the return line.
Had to use a 2X4 under tank to level it also. The gas gauge even worked for
a little while then quit. You know me and gauges so it still is not working.
Idiot lights still working fine though.
 Only 6 weeks untill Colorado shows. We're leaving LHC for Albu. around 3 AM
Thurs. August 9th. Easy 10/11 hour drive. So far it's me, Ronnie and Tom in
his super nice 63 DD Micro. No trailor queens in Havasu. Anyone want to go
with us get to Havasu Wed. or meet us in Flagstaff Thurs AM.
