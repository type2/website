&gt;Just got a call from Brad. The Van Hoy campground is a big place and we take 
&gt;up the woods in the back. The owner has allowed another group on the grounds 
&gt;this weekend. You guessed it, YEScamp'99 will be there also. 
&gt;
&gt;http://web.cetlink_dot_net/~loulamb/yescamp99.htm (ignore their directions- they 
&gt;have moved into our area)
&gt;
&gt;You have to check out this site, and people think bus owners are hippies. :-) 
&gt;I think I will make grilled cheese sandwiches :-))

The Yesheads seem to be some sort of pyramid hugging, spiritual,
transcendentalists with a posative attitude. Busfolk will mostly go
unnoticed in the mix. We will be distinguished only by our choice of engine
cases for firewood. Should be a blast. I will bring some extra cheese for
the sandwhiches.  Must remember to put some Black Flag tapes in the bus in
case the Yessers wanna do some trading. 

Stella and I will be leaving  mid afternoon from Greensboro. We will head
west on I-40. If you see a yellow and white and rust and POR15 and dirty bus
that would be us. Feel free to tag along. 

Chris

P.S.

We should all caution ourselves not to accept any cool-aid, lemonade or
simular drinks from cult members.
