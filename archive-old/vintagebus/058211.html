Subject: Re: [VB] tent

So did westfalia put roof tent mounts on all the campers,  even if they 
weren't ordered with a tent, to make it easier to mount a tent if you bought 
one later?  

That means original tent mounts on your roof that does not  say that it came 
with a tent?   Kind of a collect all the accessories idea.  makes sense.

  seems the earler westys got two roof mounts, and the later (so-42, so-44) 
ones got 4 roof mounts.

 Hi Volks,
 By having the original dealer paper work.  Tents could be bought afterward 
 from the dealer or from junked VWs.
