 I have noticed a lot of you guys and gals prefer the single port motors as
 opposed to the dual port. Is there a reason why? My bus had a DP in it when
 I got it, and it has ran good so I really never thought about it. Just
 curious! Thanks!
  &gt;&gt;

DPs are weaker, tending to crack.  I hear that the new DP heads have a better 
casting, and reinforcements, but  at least 90% of used dp heads are cracked, 
while not even 10% of sp.  DP tend to crack between the spark plug areas and 
valve areas.  maybe the heads run hotter.  So I would rather put a sp 
together than a dp in terms of long life.    But if it runs, run with it!!!!
