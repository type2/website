went up to the &quot;izzys safari windows&quot; booth at octo......told him about what
I had been hearing about his channels not being strong enuff and that the
glass was cracking. He denied all of it and said he had had no reports from
ANYONE ( even though several ppl on here told me they had contacted him and
told him) and that everyone was happy with his product and that they dont
crack........*Sigh*
