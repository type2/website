sorry for the post.
i borrowed my friends bike and rode to the store he told me about. A
challenging ride, as I am on the side of a hill. The ride is actually up hills
both ways...
Unfortunately they were sold out and won't have any more for three weeks(i
think). Then again she was talking in italian, so my translation may have been
off. 

These are actually not plastic-they are glass. They probably could be
available in the states, i have just never seen them. I am going to convince
my friend to sell me his, and have him get one when they get in stock-as I
leaving here in about two weeks. Back to my bus in about 6 weeks. 

ciao



&gt;They cost about $5, and I was going to get one for my bus, if &gt;anyone else is
interested-I could pick up a few and bring them &gt;back to the states. $5 plus
shipping.

We took a road trip to Florida a while back to pick up some fiberglass molds
for another car of mine. But I'm off the subject. We found these suction cup
bud vases in a gift shop and if I have any memory at all, I think we paid
three something. Very nice vase, sort of a frosted plastic and they come in a
wide variety of colors. So the bottom line here is that they are available in
the states. You just have to (perish the thought) get into a tourist trap and
look about for them.
