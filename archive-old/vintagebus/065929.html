Subject: RE: [VB] RE: The right size carb for the job!

Eric, I used a 34PICT-3 with 140 main and 55 air with a 009 on my 1776 on my
trike. It worked OK with the exception of a slight hesitation on pick up. I
then went to a Progressive, but not the stock set you find advertised. Over
the years I have learned about bottom end and top end power curves and the
requirements to get them. After I retired the 009 on the 1776 and put on a
VAC SVDA, I found myself a 28/36 progressive off of a 71 Pinto in the
wrecking yard. I rejetted the 28 and 36 side for the full range needed and
have had no hesitation problems off the line with the stage two cam.

	I just got my new 1776 engine with a 110 Engle cam, counter
weighted crank, and lightened flywheel. I am wondering what would be the
best carb or carbs for the job. I have a Pict30/31 and dual 34 baby
Dells. I am sure I can find in town a pict34 for a good price, But I
would also like to keep some decent mpg for a daily driver.


Any Thoughts,
Eric Lykens
