I want to throw in my two cents for this one...just in case ya know!
There are times that a wiper assembly becomes worn out at the pivots and
the point where they go thru the arms that connect to the wiper motor.
What will happen is that a binding occurs at that point.  sometimes just
temporarily and then the motor may or may not overcome it, and the wipers
again continue to operate.  Then another bind happens, etc.
One way to determine this is to move the wiper blade physically when it
stops.....does it begin operation again briefly only to stop shortly
again?  If so, then a loose fit and binding are most likely the problems.
Some of the wiper motor arms can be welded up, ground down and drilled out
again for an as new fit of the pivot.
Hope this helps in the diagnosis of the wiper problem.
later
