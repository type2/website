While reading my M-code plate in order to add my bus to Thom's registry, I
discovered the option code &quot;002&quot;,
anyone know what this is?
Also, there's a rectangular adhesive sticker just below the M-code plate
which reads &quot;Samtgrun L512&quot; (with the two little dots above the &quot;u&quot;
I assume this sticker has to do with the color (38 38 83) on the M-code
Does anyone have an idea on the 002 or the sticker?

dont know 002, but Samtgr:un is velevet green a very fine colour that is, and 
the 38 38 means the upper and lower parts of the bus are that colour (the 
sticker is repetitive and reducdant. except it does have the L code for paint 
mixing) and the 83 means mesh grey interior (aka salt and peppa)
