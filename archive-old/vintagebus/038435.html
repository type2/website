Josh,

I think if you spend a lot of time in the Archives, you will find that there
really aren't as many Tire Threads and the list admin legends seem to
imply...

For instance, there is VERY LITTLE information on 15&quot; tires for the 6.40x15
size on a split window.

Almost all tire threads of repeat center around the 14&quot; VANAGON / LOAF tires
and the heavy weight of those on 195x14 ...

Hey all,

Before our admins decide to break us up into yet another &quot;list&quot; (the tire
debaters), hows about some knowlegable, experienced soul do a cool write up
on tires vs Type2's? I can post this to the TYPE2.COM &quot;Library&quot; (on the
net) and point newbies/researchers there.
