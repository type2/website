&gt; http://www.swampy_dot_net/bvw.html  Anyone ever see one in person?  Looks like a
&gt; simpler alternative to AC if you live in a low humidity area.  I have no
&gt; affiliation to this co.

I built up a surveillance van for a PI and naturally with all the equipment
running and sitting in the sun it was a bit warm in the back there.  I set up a
Swampy in the back positioned so that it would cool the operator.  The guy
reported back that there was no way he could have done the stake-outs without
it.  It looked to me like a reasonably well built unit.  Just be careful that it
does not tip over.  You'll have a mini flood on your hands.  I strapped his to
the floor using the fastening points for the removed rear seat.
