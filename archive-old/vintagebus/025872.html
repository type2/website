Hi Volks,
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS METHOD!  We know of a fellow bus driver who did!  The 
stock VW bus steering wheel from about 1953-67 has a woodruff key to lock the 
steering wheel and shaft from slipping and a very stong spring under the 
wheel.  When the steering wheel came loose on this fellow after several 
months of driving it fortunitly happened on a straight section of highway.  
The wheel literally popped up completely loose from the tapered steering 
shaft and the woodruff key.  So over the next minute he was franticly trying 
to reinstall the steering wheel while slowing and trying to steer the bus to 
the side of the roadway!  Eric&amp;Barb
