Subject: Re: [VB] swing lever shaft bushing

Anything's possible, but more likely I'd question how the bus was towed - 
I've seen tow truck operators do some lame stuff.   I had the 911 towed one time,
and the yahoo tried to tie it down by throwing a chain over the muffler!

&gt; I had a blow out on the interstate traveling about 60 mph.  After I had it
&gt; towed to replace the tire the steering has become very tight.  The last time
&gt; I had this symptom, it turned out the swing lever pin/bushings had to be
&gt; replaced.  Can a blow out create enough torque to bend the swing lever pin?
&gt; All the tie rods look straight nad the ends look ok.  Any help you could be
&gt; would be appreciated.
