&lt;&lt; I picked up these rims a while ago- they are chromed 15&quot;x4.5 If I remember 
 the width right. Same width as the bus 15&quot; rims.  They have those ovals cut 
 in around the edge like the mid 60s bug rims.  People had told me they were 
 some sort of repro, but they do have date codes on them of 9/65.  The offset 
 is different than bus rims, the tires stick farther out towards the wheel 
 wells.  Then the other day I was checking them out again, and noticed they 
 have the Lemerz logo stamped into them, exactly like on the Lemerz 15&quot; bus 
 rims.   So I doubt they are repros.
 
 does anyone have a clue what these came from? &gt;&gt;
