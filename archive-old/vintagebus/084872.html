&gt; I did some searching locally for SPDT relays and everything I found
&gt; was $20 or more ea.

Sounds like you went to the electrical or electronics supply house.  Did
you try a car stereo or car alarm shop?  They should be awash in these
things for way less than $20.  There's about a 50% chance that the kid
behind the counter will know what you want:

If the relay he gives you only has 4 terminals, it's not the right one.

If the one he gives you has 5 terminals, see if the terminals are labeled
85, 86, 87, 87a, and 30.  If it doesn't have those markings, it's not the
right one.

Next, take your ohm meter and measure between 30 and 87 - this should be
an open circuit (high resistance).  Measure between 30 and 87a - this
should be a short circuit (low resistance).  If these readings don't pan
out, it's not the right one.
