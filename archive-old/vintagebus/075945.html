&gt; The bus is a 58 panel.  I found my VIN stamped on the passenger side seat
&gt; back.  Is this the right place?  I will compare it with the one in the 
&gt; engine compartment.

Hi Tom,
If memory serves correctly 1955-59ish buses had just a body # behind the 
front seat.  This body # stamping according to &quot;Progressive Refinments&quot; was 
completely dropped from buses, &amp; Cabriolets 6 AUG 1959.  28 AUG 1959 the body # was 
dropped from KG's.
