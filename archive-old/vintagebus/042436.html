&gt;  Stephen, that ring pops off....

but if you use a 3 spring pressure plate you need the ring...  if you use
a pressure plate with all the fingers you cant use one with the ring, if
that makes any sense...  so if you have an old school 3 spring pressure
plate in there, you NEED the TO bearing with the ring on it or it wont be
able to disengage fully... the ring is a bearing surface and a spacer of
sorts, and is neccecary.

&gt; It seems as if the cable isn't being pulled far enough to disengage the
&gt; clutch....but I went through the pedal assembly and there is nothing wrong with
&gt; it.

Dunno how kosher this is, but i was working on a guys bus where the clutch
tube had been crushed and a section replaced with a piece of pipe.  The
pipe was cut short, so the clutch cable was too long, and wouldnt actuate
the clutch fully.

We put a couple washers between the wingnut and the clutch lever arm to
get it to disengage fully.  I have since heard you can put those washers
between the bowden tube and some braket, but im not sure about that.

that will fix it in 30 seconds flat i bet, but may not solve the
problem...

&gt; Now I'm thinking gland nut ...I didn't think that the bearings in there would
&gt; grab that hard though.  maybe I can find it somewhere else
&gt; today....hopefully...because I don't want to pull the motor again and I REALLY
&gt; don't want to replace a gland nut.

you can get the needle bearing out of the gland nut and put a new one in
there, but there are easier tasks... heh. (never done it, dont know how,
just know its possible... but you may have to remove the gland nut to
change the bearing... anyone know fer sure??)

hope i helped a little,

good luck...

Steve
