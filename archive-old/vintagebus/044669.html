&lt;&lt; Does anyone know what year Bug or Bus uses this 50mm heater box?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Skid,
Used from 15DEC62 on into early 1964 (About NOV63) model year.  Almost of 
this one yearish model heater box has no inner fins inside of the heater 
J-tube only on the outside.  These are not good for 1500 or larger engines.  
Very few of the small snout fresh air heater boxes have the internal fins and 
can be viewed up the rear sides about 4&quot; inside of the heater exhaust tube.
