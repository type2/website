&gt; does anyone know if the 64-67 front doors can be used on a 63 with or without 
&gt; modification? or someone mentioned earlier the possibility of installing a 
&gt; later door handle on 63 doors. I'm just trying to figure out a mystery bus, 
&gt; And I've seen early 64s with pull handles so it does not seem likely that a 
&gt; late 63 would have push buttons. what gives? 

..The change was in dec63, which mean early 64 models have pull handles.  Yes the key code was switched for the 64 model year, when they changed the rear hatch to the wide one.   This means there are a few T series locking pull handles floating around.   A bus buildt late in 63 is a 64 model.   So that is just terminolgy.

I have seen pull handle door on a push button bus and vice versa, but it is a sort of hack modification, and if you need to swap doors really don't do that, get the kind your bus came with.
