Subject: Re: what tool for manifold nuts?

 &gt;can't imagine the factory running down those hard to get at 10mm nuts on
 &gt;the single port intake manifolds. is there a cool tool to hunker them down
 &gt;with? i've thrown everything i got at them and they're starting to strip.
 &gt;prolly the cause of my vacuum leak. - steve

 &gt;I get both started .   I use a 10mm wrench.  The round end, and it needs to
 &gt;be somewhat skinny. Craftsman doesn't fit there.    Important to snug down
 &gt;the &gt;hard to get side with a wrench first, then I use the long 10mm 
socket on the
 &gt;shorty ratchet on the easy to get to side.   I think they only want around
 &gt;7.5 &gt;ft lbs.  The idea is to squish the copper gasket to make a seal.
   ============

from me:
I also use a 1/4&quot; 10mm socket that I&quot;ve shortened then ground down around
the outer rim with a 'wobbly' extension for a better fit around the front
of the manifold.  This is a tenuous connection at best through time as the
heads expand and contract and the otherwise unsupported manifold with it's
perched carburetor temple sways about.  I always give a coat of Gasgachinch
to the (very clean) sealing surface of the head and two coats to both sides
of the copper gasket before assembling.  It's sticky tenacious stuff.
