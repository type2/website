&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; This falls under the &quot;what were they thinking&quot; category.
&gt;
&gt; I won an eBay auction for a pair of reduction boxes, axle tubes and
&gt; shafts. Apparently, the set up was put together for a baja that was
&gt; never finished. The tubes were fitted to adapters that allowed the
&gt; reduction boxes lay on their side.

Laid-down reduction boxes were quite popular with the Baja folks as they
allowed the use of larger tires with the long protruding torsion bars.

The bad news was that a bug or buggy so equipped was rather spooky to
handle with large power changes.  The same effect that allows reduction
box equipped buses to lift their rear slightly under acceleration worked
the same with laid down boxes.  If you got halfway around a corner at
speed and suddenly lifted off the throttle you would lose the back end and
spin if you weren't careful.

OTOH, if you saw a nasty bump coming up, you could hit the gas and lift
the rear end a bit.  Made for aggressive driving technique!  :)
