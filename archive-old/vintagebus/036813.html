Hi Greg,   In a message dated 98-09-22 01:07:25 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 1. Even though my van is a 69 I can't assume that's the original motor
 and year....Is there a stamping easily visible while the motor is
 installed so I can look it up?&gt;&gt;
Yes, it should be under the generator stand.  The idit manual by John Muir has
a list of the numbers and years.
 
 &lt;&lt;2.If it is a 69 type 2 bus it should be statically set for 0 deg TDC...?&gt;&gt;
The timing is set according to the distributor, not the year of the engine
unless it has the original distributor.
 
&lt;&lt; 3.I know for sure the carb is after 70 cause it has the fuel adjustment
 screw as well as the air idler screw...&gt;&gt;
Okay that does not seem to be a question...
 
 &lt;&lt;4. If the engine pings while going up hills or during a load is the
 timing to far advanced....Advanced meaning 1degree or higher.....or is it
 under timed?....-1 degree or lower....&gt;&gt;
Advanced as in farther clockwise from the TDC mark on your pulley and can
cuase pinging.
 
 &lt;&lt;Thanks for any help I appreciate it..&gt;&gt;
You are welcome, get the Bentley manual for your year bus and that idiot
manual also.   Eric &amp; Barb
