&gt; I was going through my stash of stuff I got from the PO when I bought my '65
&gt; DC and found a side step. Did side steps come standard on a DC? Also, is
&gt; there any way to tell if it is original?

Hi Steve,
Doubt it was from the factory that way, but could have been a dealer add on.  
Our 1963 SC came with trim rings with proper dates on three of the four, and 
the fourth was dated a bit earlier.  As for your step there are ones that fit 
under the cargo area, and other that fit under the front doors.  Of each of 
these there are at least six differant manufactures and styles!
