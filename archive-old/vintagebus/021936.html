&lt;&lt; Anyone have any suggestions on what material to use underneath the gas 
tank straps on the 4 top corners? &gt;&gt;

Robert,  Fortunately for me, my shop partner is a carpet installation 
contractor, and there is a felt-type carpet pad that is an almost exact 
replacement for the pads under the straps and under the tank that I've used 
in the past.  If you, or anybody else on the list, can't get any, p-mail me, 
and I'll send you enough to install a tank or two.  I usually hold it place 
with rubber cement type glue for installation.
