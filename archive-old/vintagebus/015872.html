Agreed the &gt;68 tents are too common to really warrant repopping them (the
materials they used were of very high quality to boot)

personally i would pay for a set of repop poles for my circa 62 full length
westy tent. i think there would be a market for those, though people are right
that their is a high initial investedment. isn't d. deniger thinking of
repopping tents and or poles for ca. 61'ish westy's??
