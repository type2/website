Subject: difference between 1500 and 1600
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am in the middle of rebuilding my engine and suddenly realize that it is 
one of the last 1500 cc and not a 1600 cc like I thought that I had  .

will 1600 single port heads also be 1500 cc heads ?
does the engine kit that i bought for a 1600 cc single port fit corrrectly?

what are the differences
shall I just buy a new case for a 1600 with dual reliefs and install my 
single port heads?
john
