Subject: Re: [VB] cooling test report

&gt;  How hot do people's engines with head temp sensors run?  I had the
&gt;impression that it was about 250F at idle, and 350F under way.  ?????????

exactly what i get. 400 if going up a long hill.




&gt;engine compartment pressure was not linear with how fast I went in 4th gear. 
&gt;  It generally was a bit lower than ambient (about 760 mmHg compared to 764mm
&gt;Hg), but was higher at 60 and 65 than at 55 or 70.
&gt;
&gt;probably no big surprises



  i dunno - WHY why does it go up, then down?
