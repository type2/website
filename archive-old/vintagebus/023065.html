*it happens.  You either need to pull harder, or use a big hammer and a
block of wood to smack on the axle stub to get her loose.  Or a drum
puller.  Or a torch and parafin - use the torch and melt some wax on your
girlfriend, and your brake drum will be the least of your problems...

&gt;forgetting something here??  It appears as if the axle stub is greased
&gt;too....there is a little oozing out.  I kept the wheel on for pulling
&gt;power.... (that and the last schmuck who took the wheels off used an
&gt;impact wrench!!) do i need to remove the wheel??... or just pull
&gt;harder??
