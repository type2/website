Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Clara has struck on something I've been noticing lately when driving Rosie.
People smile when they see her. It is particularly gratifying to see the
expression on an oncoming driver change to a smile when they see her smiling
face.

&gt; People on the freeway seriously loved that truck, they would wave and
smile
&gt; at me, or slow down as they passed to take a look.   No one honked or
flipped
&gt; the bird or scowled
