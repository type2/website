Hi all,

Just got my bus ('64) back from the mechanic.  He says he thinks the front
torsion bars are &quot;froze up&quot;.  This is not why I had it in the shop, and I have
not noticed any thing strange about the ride at all.  He says &quot;that's why it
rides so hard&quot;.  Don't all buses ride somewhat hard?  Is there some way I can
be sure this guy isnt messing with me?  By the way, he said he wouldnt want to
try and fix it even if it was broken.
&quot;Too much trouble&quot;  What do you guys think?  Is there something i can look
for?

don't know what that means- actually torsion bars can be replaced in an
afternoon, but doubt thats ithe problem.    Try  jumping up and down on the
front bumper- it moves?  Does it ride like other splitties?    Maybe he is
used to a bay window ride- the splitty kingpins are different that ball
joints.  If you are worried, or if it hasn't been done recently, give the old
bus a lube job, pump clean grease through the zerk fittings on the axle tubes
and king /link pins and anywhere else you may have them  till it comes out
clean.   I smear the old stuff on the pedals and moving parts under the front
of the bus.  I was told it is also  good against rust.  Lubing should be done
w/every 3,000 servicing.
