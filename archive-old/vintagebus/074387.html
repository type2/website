Subject: Re: [VB] fog lights

i put a reverse light on my bus, pic on thesamba or vintagebus, without 
drilling holes.  You could do this for additional brake light if you like, but you 
need red lenses for brake lights.  red nail polish would probably work.

What's wrong with your taillights? since you said plural, I assume it's glass 
lensed or later, and have you cleaned up the connections? grounds?

&lt;&lt; So,  as everyone knows, tail lights on an early bus are kind of a joke.  
I'm
 thinking about mounting a couple of auxiliary lights on my 60.  Maybe, just
 sort of clamp em on the bumper some how and wire them into my brake lights.  
I
 have a set of 70's fog lights new and still in the box.  If I used em as 
brake
 lights would the fact that they are yellow fog lights be an issue?
