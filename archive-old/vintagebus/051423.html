&gt; do these fit with a stock exaust?&lt;&lt;

Hi Ronnie,
Depends!  We have been using vintage EMPI oil filter/pumps with great 
results, because it mounts the oil filter to the right side of the pump.  So 
far WIX filters are the ones we have found that will not blow up on a cold 
morning, due to having a quality internal relief valve and filter the oil 
properly unlike FRAM filters.
  We have used Shradek (Name is cast inside the gear space/housing.) oil 
filter/pumps which mount the filter on the right side.  By hacksawing about 
half way between the pump cover and the filter mounting point we angle the 
filter down about 30 degrees to clear the heat riser tube coming out of the 
stock mufflers left forward side (Yes, you could modify the muffler and then 
the next and the next, and the next.).  Then either do the welding ourselfs 
or have a local welder do the aluminum welding.  Followed by a little 
drilling out the passages in the welded area.   All other modern aftermarket 
oil filter/pumps we have seen so far are badly designed and machined compared 
to the Shradek oil filter/pump.  All told this oil filter/pump costs about 
$100.00 total with paying for the welding and some of your time.  Never have 
to remove the sump plate to do tealeaf reading or cleaning due to the metal 
shaving are in the filter.  With all metal flakes being trapped in the filter 
instead of going through it over and over the pump should last two or even 
three engine rebuilds.  Rebuilds that should last much longer.  Plus with the 
filteration rebuilding just the top end becomes much more possible since the 
bearings are not worn out with debris.  Even when the oil pump part of the 
oil filter/pump wears out one can sand flat or have machined the pump cover 
with the modified filter stand and install it on a new oil filter/pump, 
saving one the time and $ of cutting and welding.   Eric&amp;Barb

&gt;&gt; ever had any problems with the heat from &gt; the exaust? &lt;&lt;

We have not noticed a change in oil temp or pressure.  At the point the oil 
is going through the filter the air temp coming off the cylinders and heads 
is overall cooler than the oil.  Which is why stock pushrod tubes also cool 
the oil.

&gt;&gt; anyone have any thoughts as to how these compare to the &gt; &quot;factory&quot; filters 
&gt; that mount at the cooler as far as ease of maintance?&lt;&lt;

The problem is that filter setup only filters the oil going to the cooler, 
and we worry if there is any restriction there the oil will just be forced to 
bypass the cooler.
