The bus looks very nice. Being a double door with double steps is cool. It 
has the side tent and some extras. If the engine and tranny are as listed, 
I'd say that is a fair price. Definitely worth driving out to look at.

65 EZ Camper

&gt; Hello all.  I found a sundial camper at
&gt; http://home.inreach_dot_com/tmrj/bus/bus.html and was wondering about the 
rarity or
&gt; it.  This 65 is a double door which brings up a question.  Do campers 
start out
&gt; as a panels or kombis?  The way this one looks it might just be a double 
door
&gt; panel with the camper equipment installed.  On one of the pics it looks 
like it
&gt; only has windows on the doors....  Anyway, the owner says it has never 
been
&gt; wrecked and has no rust so maybe it is worth the $3700.  I am driving to 
Las
&gt; Vegas next week so I might just drive a bit further to LA and check it 
out.  Any
&gt; comments or advice is welcome.  I've been looking for a decent bus for 8 
weeks
&gt; now!
