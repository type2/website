Hi David,
Front, or signals?

&lt;&lt;But it also has the small parking lights in the headlight buckets... is 
there somethig im missing?&gt;&gt;
Yes, there should be small single filament bulbs in there for parking lights 
only.

&lt;&lt; Several Volks have siad that theyre supposed to be single element as does 
the diagram.... What to do, what to do....  Did I mention theres no blinker 
relay, just trying to get em to work the way there supposed to...  &gt;&gt;
If your truck is a very early 1962, or maybe miss dated, and is an earlier 
model it could have been a semaphore model.  Eric&amp;Barb
