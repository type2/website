we've coated the bases of some of our roof rack clamps with this 
&quot;plasti-kote&quot; stuff.  It's black though.  Works great.  I've used both the 
dip in style and the spray on kind.  the srpay on kind is easier to use, but 
the dip in kind gives you a better/slightly thicker coating.

P.S. we're about 30 miles from OCTO with room to camp.  No ammenities and 
only semi flat ground, but it's relatively close and the price is right if 
you're looking for a place to crash Fri night.
