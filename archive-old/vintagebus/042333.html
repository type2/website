&gt; last year or so. At Lowes, I bought the highest model CH Wire fed welder
&gt; which can be used with either flux core gas-less wire or mig wire with a gas
&gt; mixture. This welder came with the gas regulator, mask, small spool of flux
&gt; cored wire..ect. The entire set-up cost $299...if you go to a welding supply
&gt; and buy a brand like Lincoln you will spend the $700+ ******* I have to

Lowes and Home Depot both carry Lincoln SP100 welders.  Base model
mig/flux lincoln, rather the same as the CH you purchased.  They go
between 299 and 310, depending on the store.  The gas kit costs another
89-99 dollars, this enables you to use a shielding gas, insdead of just
running crappy flux wire. (comes with the regulator, hoses, and a new
gun/hose (iirc..or the one in the kit is already set for gas..memory!:)

When i looked at the CH, the overall impression i got was that it was
cheaply built.  but that's just my opinion, everyone has their own.;)
Lincoln replacement parts are available in nearly every mid-major city
(yes.  parts wear out over time.  I dunno about you, but i plan on owning
my welder for a bit more then &quot;a year&quot;;)  some of my more often used tools
are over 30 years old..)



The SP100 comes with a roll of flux-wire, and i .think. the gas kit comes
with a spool of mig wire..

what tom says about the gas and cylinders is dead on, though.  You .may.
want to shy away fromt he full size tank though if you dont work inside a
shop all the time, and plan on moving it around. (5ft tall tanks are
heavy, and awkward to move....and if you drop it and bust that
regulator....yup.)

later...david
