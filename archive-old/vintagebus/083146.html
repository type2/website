Subject: re:weird 28 pict

I'm not sure what is weird about it? It looks like a 28pict carb that I had,
I think I gave it away a few years ago. Mine was not new-but it didn't have
any problems. IF I new it could be worth that much, I would not have given
it away.

I had it on a 1600 SP engine, and when I was getting a new engine-the engine
builder told me not to use that carb with the engine.
