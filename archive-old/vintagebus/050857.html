From: &quot;Denis Dodson&quot; &lt;coocoo70_at_swbell_dot_net&gt;


&gt; Hey, don't you love it when sh*t happens for the good?
&gt;
&gt; My wife and I were going to lunch and we stopped at the Barnes and Noble
&gt; bookstore first. Next door was a big bike shop and I told Jan I wanted to
&gt; stop in and check the prices on roof racks for Murray. I want the kind I
&gt; have on my Montero, they are simply four rain gutter towers with
crossbars,
&gt; but they need to be much taller. I like them because I can adjust them to
&gt; any length. I use the bus for work and I can put 40 foot ladders and doors
&gt; and sheets of plywood, or put them to the back for luggage. A shop in
Eugene
&gt; had them for about $150 (ouch).
&gt;
&gt; So, as we are looking this guy walks up and asks us what we need, he was
the
&gt; local Yakima rep. He asked for what car, and I hate that, 'cuz as soon as
&gt; you say &quot;63 bus&quot; you lose 'em. I told him and he pulls out their new
&gt; catalogue and IT HAS A SPLIT BUS ON THE COVER. It belongs to Yakima's CEO.
&gt; There are risers that attach to the ones on the Montero, $40 for the set.
&gt; Everything I wanted for a third of the price.
&gt;
