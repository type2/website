&lt;&lt; You should get a 30/31 carb. They dont cost that much, will replace the

 you have, they are new, and they are jetted for the 1600 dual right out. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
Probably not a bad idea, but remember that these carbs have to be jetted for 
more than just a 1600 DP engine.  Air cleaner, muffler, and even type and 
year of engine compartment make big differances!   Eric&amp;Barb
