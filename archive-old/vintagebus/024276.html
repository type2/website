I've got a 67, not camper.  It's got soul like no other vehicle I've
ever owned.  I grin the whole time I'm driving it.  Sounds like you're
into VWs enough to know what to look for so the mechanical decision's up
to you.  The real question is whether it's worth it to YOU.  $3k doesn't
sound too out of line, a bit on the high side maybe but that depends on
the condition of not only the vehicle but the interior as well.

 Should I go there?
