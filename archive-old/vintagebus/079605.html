 Hello, I am in need of both spindle nuts for the
 driver side or my `66 single cab.  I need both of

 left hand threads being on the driver side.  I also
 need at least one of the passenger side spindle
 nuts...these are proper right hand threads...heck

 just purchase all 4 nuts for both sides if anyone
 has some.
