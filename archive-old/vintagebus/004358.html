A fellow VWer (Zac) and I are wanting to get ahold of the dual solex carb
set that is sold on the beetles down in Brazil.  Getting the carbs wouldn't
be necessary but the linkage, manifolds, and any other part that is crucial
to the installation would be.

Is there anyone on here that lives in Brazil that would like to have some
money wired to them in exchange for sending us the parts?  We're ready to
get the ball rolling if we can make contact with someone down there...

Thanks!
