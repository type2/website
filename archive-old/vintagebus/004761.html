Mike,
    Do it!
    Splitties are desirable for a bunch of reasons. They are the last of a
particular design landmark, The kiddies love them, they sit in your yard
making money, and they love you back.

    Brakes are not hard if you are logical. Just a small and quite easy
memory test &amp;  jigsaw puzzle. Open two at one end, (front or back) and do
one at a time using the other as reference. Go for new wheel cylinders all
round if you can afford it, and recon the existing ones for spares in 2010.
Average skill  is enough. If you tow it home, get a friend to come help,
drink beer after.

Ive had both, and 12v is easier. Its not hard to do, check the archives.
    Good Luck.
    Barry Wright

&gt; Hey Vintage Volks-
&gt;
&gt; I just signed up to the list this week.  I have been on the Type2 list
&gt; in the past to help me out with my '70 Campmobile.
&gt;
&gt; Just this week, a very tempting and interesting situation has come up.
&gt; I have the opportunity to pick up a 1962 Bus from an &quot;in-law&quot; for a very
&gt; cheap price.  I live in Truckee, CA and the bus is sitting in his back
&gt; yard in Espanola, NM.  It hasn't been driven since about 1990 but he
&gt; says he has started it &quot;a few times.&quot;  He says is definitely needs new
&gt; brakes (drums) all the way around.  Thre are 40,000 miles on the engine
&gt; since the last rebuild.  He says the body is in &quot;good&quot; shape.  I know
&gt; that when he was actively using the bus, he kept it in great mechanical
&gt; shape.   He also had added some sort of gas heater too.
&gt;
&gt; I've owned my '70 for about 3 years and have done most of the work on it
&gt; myself including a few engine pulls but I would still rank my bus
&gt; mechanical skills as average at best.  So, my questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Is is worth it? (I know it is) I'd obviously have to tow it back
&gt; here to CA since I can't afford the time to go and out there and spend a
&gt; couple weeks fixing it up so it could make the long trek back.
&gt; 2.  What is the time/effort/money involved in converting to 12-volt?
&gt; If I leave it 6 volt, what sort of things might come back to haunt me?
&gt; 3.  What is the time/effort/money involved in doing the brakes?  I've
&gt; never done brakes on any car I've ever owned.
&gt; 4.  I'm thinking of flying out there for a quick weekend to take a look
&gt; at the bus.  Would anyone in the area be interested in doing a little
&gt; research with me?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any advice and/or help!!
&gt;
&gt; Mike
