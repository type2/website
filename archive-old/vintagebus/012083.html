Hi all,
	Just wanted to add my vast knowledge of temp. shelters to the fray.  We
bought a shelter from Sam's Club a year ago for $200. It had a metal frame
and silver tarp with elastic strap thingies to hold the tarp on. Not a bad
deal, we thought. One note, though, which I'm sure is common sense to most
of you.....tie the thing down!!!!!!  We had ours sheltering firewood and it
was picked up in a storm and set down on top of our BMW !  DOH!         
Sam's has a somewhat different version of the same shelter now for $179 or
so, and it actually looks nicer...double layer of a white tarp. (Our silver
one did not last one year in the sunlight and weather). It still does not
come with tie down straps and anchors, though, so factor those into the
price, and DON'T use one to shelter your VW without anchoring it first (our
storm kicked up about a week after putting up the shelter!).
