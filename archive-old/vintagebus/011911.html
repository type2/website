&gt; &lt;&lt; If you turn the fan off completely, hot air will rise (via a
chimney
&gt;  effect) through the electric fans and into the passenger
compartment. 
&gt;  This air would be _very_ hot and would probably toast the fans.&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi George, 
&gt; Good point.  Have many times been startled at how much hot air comes
out of
&gt; the engine compartment slits when the engine has just been shut off.
&gt;  
&gt;  &lt;&lt;My preferred method around this is to build a flapper box that
will seal
&gt; the fans from the exchangers when they are off, and to pass flow
from the
&gt; engine fan through the exchangers to provide cooling.  This way, the
electric
&gt; fans won't have to be on all the time.  This is a variation of the
system from
&gt; a late-model baywindow, with
&gt;  recirculation added.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Well the only two problems with this is if you rely on the power of
the
&gt; electric fans to push closed the flaps against the engine fan they
might not
&gt; have enough power to do so.

The way around this is to restrict the flow from the engine by placing
an orifice in the engine fan inlet to the flapper box.  If you put a
2-cm hole in the flow path, the electric fan will have no problem
overcoming the engine fan.

  Secondly the reason we prefer the partial
&gt; recirculation system is that if there is monoxide leak somewhere in
the
&gt; heating system.  The new fresh air will help to avoid the monoxode
from just
&gt; building up to higher and higher levels that a closed circulation
system would
&gt; cause.

I'd expect that normal leaks from the system would cause fresh air to
be drawn into the cabin.  However, a sizeable leak from the exhaust
manifold into the heat exchanger could supply all the &quot;make-up&quot; volume
and turn the bus into a gas chamber.  My feeling is that you would
certainly notice a leak of this magnitude, but I'd probably go for a
CO detector just the same.
