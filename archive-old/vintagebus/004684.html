&gt; you've obvioulsy never met Kyle.  I was rather surprised to hear it was
beer
&gt; he was drinking and not tequila.
&gt;

Proper valve adjusting etiquette requires that you not drink Tequila until
after the blessed event. You shouldn't lay on your back. Instead, you must
lay on your side. If you are laying on your back, you must first lower your
bus to bring things into the proper perspective. Far too complicated, and
also you have to drink canned beer, no room for bottles. Too high of a price
to pay. Far better to retain the stock ride height so that a nice frosty
longneck will fit under there, but I digress. Once positioned on your side,
and having previously moved all of the pebbles that were digging into your
ribs, you can remove the valve covers. Assuming you have positioned the
engine on TDC for #1, you may commence alternately adjusting valves and
slamming brew. Lather, rinse, rotate counterclockwise 180 degrees, and
repeat on each of the other three. Once you get good at it you should be
able to finish the whole job with one beer and only then move on to the
Tequila. Or not finish it as is your custom.... In a minute honey, gotta
finish up adjusting these valves here.....

So when a clubmember brought his bus over this weekend to do a little engine
work, I took inventory. I have seven splits in my yard. No, I don't live in
an association. Got the 59 singlecab and the Westfailure, the 61 Kombi which
is a future project ( if I ever start working on my own buses 8^)  ), the 60
Kombi that Matt and Katie donated to the Arizona Bus Club for this years
Jerome raffle bus, a 65 panel I'm stowing for a friend, a '67 poptop Westy
with the same situation, and the 67 Westy we were working on. If the
Westfailure weren't so long there would be room for one more. It would make
a Hell of a picture from the garage roof. Looks like the holding pen at a
slaughterhouse.

On the valve adjusting subject, Sears sells a nifty little socket set called
an O-wrench (not their brand). Hollow sockets and wrench. Hollow extensions
too, should that ever come up. Complete set ran about thirty simoleans a few
months back, standard and metric included. That thirteen socket and the
wrench are kind of nifty, stick your screwdriver right through it. Real
knuckle saver and is actually pretty well made. Lots of bang for your buck
in the road kit. No need for deep sockets and the regular sockets work for
spark plugs as well.

Enough babbling for now.
