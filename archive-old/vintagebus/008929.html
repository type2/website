I haven't a clue about the model number...

A buddy's 1930 Plymouth coupe had a factory-installed Southwind gas heater
under the dash in front of the passenger side of the seat.  He was the 2nd
owner, and the heater was listed in the original paperwork from Plymouth.

It put out gobs of heat, used very little fuel, and was completely reliable.
We often took long Winter trips to ski areas, and using the heater only
dropped the car's gas mileage by ~1mpg.  [This was back in the '50s.]

The heater's steel housing was about the same size and shape as an old hot
water truck heater, and had a typical '30s/'40s fake woodgrain finish.  It
connected to the engine's fuel line with copper tubing ~3/16&quot; OD.  There was
a single wire connection to a dash-mounted switch that worked like a
headlight switch - pulled out for ON [with an indicator bulb in the knob],
then rotated to adjust the heat output.

I guess my point is that they've been around a long time.  I expect they've
been installed in a wide range of makes and models, but doubt they built any
heaters that were specific to a single make/model/year.  You could dig
through Hemmings Motor News to see if anyone specializes in
repairing/restoring Southwind gas heaters.  Such a business might have a
wider range of application listings than is currently in the Type 2 Library.

&gt;&gt;  At a local flea market today I spotted a Stewart-Warner Southwind gas
heater model #781.  Anyone know what make/model of cars this would have come
on?  I'm checked the type2 library link to the SW manual.  I
don't see that model listed for VW's.  But I don't really see any 3 digit
model numbers.  Thought I'd ask.  &lt;&lt;
