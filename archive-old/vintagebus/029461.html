&gt;I'm trying to swap steering wheels.  Read the Type2 Library, and I
wondered if there's another way to do this that may be easier (please no
sawzall comments).
&gt;
You can sawzall it off.  Oh wait...

I've used a huge 3-arm gear puller where I put each of the arms around the
shaft and slowly increased the pulling force while I hit the underside of
the outside ring of the wheel with my palms.  In retrospect, I think I got
extremely lucky in not cracking or chipping the wheel.  The best method
is to have a real puller with a 2-piece plate that evenly distributes force
around the whole wheel collar, IMHO.  Can these be rented from a local parts
place?
