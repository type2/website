Subject: How fast am I going? (or, how slow?)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Please forgive me, but all this talk of freeway fliers
has got me wondering....

Today was the first day I took a real drive in
DARTHVW. 8 miles to work, even braved the 405 freeeway
(right lane only, was tailgated by a FORD Explosion
the entire exit ramp. A--hole).

Anyway, My speedo read 55mph at top speed. Based on
the flow of traffic, I want to think I may have been
going (gasp!) faster than this. Here's what I know:

Engine is a 1500 SP with a 30 Solex carb.
Tires are P205/75 R14
Tranny is from Transform. The receipt (from PO) says
&quot;option: .82 4th&quot; Which I guess means freeway flier.

Given this configuration would this make the speedo
read slower than actual?

Show me the way, enlightened ones, For I may try to
make it down to OCTOfest Sunday, and need to know
wether I may be relegated to surface streets the whole
50 miles.

Jason &quot;call boxes are my friend&quot; Elm

PS: anyone from LA/SB heading that way? I could use a
caravan partner(s)
