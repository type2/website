Subject: tools for the bus.

Hey Mon,

  Well, got a squeezewrench (as seen on teevee!) for a gift.  I looked at
it carefully and thought the screwdriver bits would help get in those hard
to get engine tin screws, and then thought of the front transmission
mount.  Ya know those two nuts, one is nearly impossible to turn, the
other is a challenge.  Problem is it only goues up to 14 mm and I think it
is a 15 mm! Fudge!

Friday non-bus content!

  I with Ellis, can't wait for a change for the good, tired of people
putting down our longtime allies, and cheering on the insanity, sure
Saddam was bad, and if we were not in such a hurry to put down our allies
they would have been helping us now, go to truthout_dot_org to read what is
really going on, or Paul Krugmans column in the NYT.

Best,
joe
