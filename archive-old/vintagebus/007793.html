Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Hi  Since driving a 67 deluxe in 67(friends )and the 69 Westfalia(parents)
in 69 this is the first bus I've had/driven  with a bigger engine than
stock, and I laugh every time I pull away from a stop sign :) some day I'll
go back to the 1600/1500/1200, but I'm having too much fun with this... and
I will double check the pulley alignment  thanks  Lloyd in Eureka. Calif

&gt;&gt;  Hi      I've got 2 1776 engines one stretches and rotates belts, I've
gone
&gt;&gt;  through 3 in 2500 miles, the other does not,same belts, adjusted the
same.
&gt;I
&gt;&gt;  don't go over 5500 rpm in either engine, and usually way below that, 4th
&gt;&gt;  gear cruising isn't the highest rpm for me  it's shifting up through the
&gt;&gt;  gears... The engine that stretches belts revs up so much quicker, I
think
&gt;it
&gt;&gt;  must be the speed it changes RPM (lightened fly wheel and in the
Beetle).
&gt;I
&gt;&gt;  was browsing through Air cooled nets web site and He has a belt to use
to
&gt;&gt;  combat this. I'm going to get one of those and see what happens... Lloyd

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;well, just keep a bunch of belts with you, as since the option of driving
&gt;more conservatively probably won't appeal.     to be more specific,
speedily
&gt;revving to 5,500 is yes likely to affect the belt.   quickly revving up and
&gt;down would affect it more than smoothly revving to a top speed and cruising
&gt;in 4th.
&gt;
&gt;other question- are you pulleys lined up properly?  The crank pulley in the
&gt;same line as the gen pulley?  if they are not, then belts will be affected.
&gt;The reason for this offset could be a 38A gen, using diff gen front cover
&gt;plates, or diff gen pulley.
