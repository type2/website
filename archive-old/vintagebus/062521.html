&gt; I have insider information on this.  Martha has formed a start-up
&gt; company to make these and is going public with a public offering.  Care
&gt; to pony up a small investment?  heh,heh,heh.

&gt; 
&gt;Actually Curt, JP told me that these scoops are already made for the Martha
Stewart Collection at K-Mart. They are readily available for those bus
aficionados who like working w/ Martha/JP &amp; have a plasma cutter to fine
tune Martha's work for that truly vintage look.  Needless to say, Martha has
already cornered the insider trading aspect of this endeavor!

Heh, heh, heh.
