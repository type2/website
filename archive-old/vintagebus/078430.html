Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

Hello Guys   What I did was to get some grab handles out of the back of a bay 
window and put them on my front doors of my splits. The OE handles for 66-67 
were plastic and tended to break. the rear grab handles from bays are rubber 
covered and are about ten times stronger. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
