And use your psychokinetic super powers to manipulate it in the blind area
between the belly pans and the floor?

But seriously, how in the heck can you fish it thru totally blind?

&gt;&lt;&lt; My only 2 ideas right now are:
&gt; 1.  Open up the belly pan to route the cable.  (Not an option)
&gt; 2.  Route the cable outside the pan's next to the gas line.  (Don't really 
&gt;like that one)
&gt;  any other's out there?  Any ideas on fishing a cable thru? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Matt we did this for a friend's DD panel.  She wanted to install 
&gt;instruments and needed the trailer cable with the six wires inside it.  You 
&gt;just run it through one of the unused cable tubing holes in the cross
members 
&gt;and use a coat hanger to pull it through.   Eric&amp;Barb
