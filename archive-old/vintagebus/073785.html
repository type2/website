Subject: Re: [VB] Paint question - waterproofing brown oxide primer?

If you intend to use the truck while it is still in primer, do yourself
a favor and use a catalyzed two part EPOXY primer.  I've used PPG
products, but every major automotive refinish company has their own
line.  These products will stand up to weather much better than any type
of &quot;primer surfacer&quot; which will actually attract moisture.  You should
be able to get anywhere from a year to 5 years of use from an
epoxy(primer)product.  But remember this is NOT a top coat, so don't
expect it to last forever!  

Here is a link to a PPG P-sheet on their DPLF (LF if more
environmentally friendly)

&gt; My 62 DC will be a working truck and 'test sled'.
