i buy many of my spare stuff at shows for way cheap.  you've inspired me to
take a pic of my arrangement.  i'll get a pic this afternoon and post it
later.  it all fits very nicely in my westfalia-all those cabinets......all
that storage space...................

&gt; Yeh, I'd love to see that list...as well as where you put it all!!! You 
&gt; know, I can hardly afford to buy the stuff the first time for my bus...I 
&gt; can't imagine buying it all again for spare!

&gt; &gt;ah, there's room for people, too.  maybe i should make a comprehensive
list
&gt; &gt;of what i actually carry around and really freak people out.  i have
helped
&gt; &gt;many a broken down bus with the stupid crap i seem to have in my parts
box.
