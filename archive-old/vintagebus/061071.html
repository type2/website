Subject: Re: [VB] Bus and a BUG question

&gt; I think the original reason for that gas to be used
&gt; has to do with the valves and or valve guides but I am
&gt; not sure if that is still relevent. I only run 92 (91)
&gt; in my bus and it has never pinged!

No. You are confusing octane with leaded gas.
