Subject: Re: [VB] 1967 Bus Turn Signal Switch

We did have some problems with left brake light not working on this
trip. Our solution was to spray lots of Radio Shack contact cleaner into
the switch contacts disassembled and protecting the surroundings from
over spray.  Reassemble and all was better again.

&gt; Can't believe it! I have no brake lights and the problem has been traced to
&gt; my Bus turn signal Switch. I have called most everywhere WWM, BFY, Bus Boys
&gt; and others, no one has one for sale. If anyone knows of a source or has one
&gt; for sale, I would be much obliged.
