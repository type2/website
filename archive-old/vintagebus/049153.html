The type 4 engine has 5, 17mm bolts holding the flywheel on. Torque? I'd say about 75 lbs., but I've only taken 'em off. 

From what I remember from the Muntz 4 track the old man won in a raffle, it held the same amount of music as a vinyl LP of the day. Nancy Sinatra, the Bee Gees and maybe Rubber Soul. The pinch roller was in the deck, not the tape, and the heads would move mechanically. The tape was continuous, pulled from the center and wound back on the outside of the single reel.  E-bay has a good selection of 8 track. Dylan and even Steely Dan currently. 

Getting ready for Jerome. Karl and I will ride the goat-vomit-green '78 Westy out. No use wasting gas driving two beasts, besides the fact that the orange DC induces headaches 50 feet away with the color clash. Hope to have a  cooler system for the seats and to show the crowd. Might show some pictures of a dashboard idea I have. 

Managed to hack half a nose panel off a '66 for the steering wheel man. Used the third Harbor Freight Chicago brand 18v sawzall after the first two failed. One bad battery charger, the other saw quit halfway through the job. It was only $100 on sale. Don't buy it if you need a reliable tool. Get a second battery and throw their blades away immediately. Otherwise it works well enough to cut through door posts, inner supports along with the skin and front heater vents along with the skin. 

Gas prices... Is anybody producing oil? I mean making it instead of pumping it up? No. What do we use oil for besides burning? Plastics, medicine, chemicals for manufacturing, etc. Yeah, we'll all be driving hemp-oil, or fuel cell busses in 10 years, but the petrochemicals are more useful if they aren't burned now. Convert that Bug or Thing or Rabbit to an EV for your 20 mile commutes and save the gas for Jerome.
