&gt; Several parts houses sell the stamped metal panels that you should be able
&gt; to weld in place.  Look and see how its done to a single cab at
&gt; www.dropgates_dot_com .  They show a step by step bed repair there.

If it's anything like a single cab bed, Tom Mink had a nice big section of
it that he couldn't give away last year.  Man oh man did I ever want that
piece.

I was told by Rob Laffoon on the buskatiers list that the corrugations from
back by the engine area on standard buses are the same and can be used as
patch panels in beds and on the floors.
