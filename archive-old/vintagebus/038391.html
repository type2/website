Subject: Crew cab value, more agony, '64 photos

Uggh.  The fundamental problem I face is that Crew Cabs, especially nice
ones for sale, are few and far between.  This makes it difficult to compare
prices.  And, well, I don't want to be an anshamed listee for paying too
much :)  Especially with all the great help I have received...

Ok, the great body $3500 crew cab doesn't exist.  I want a daily driver I
can maintain and is easily reverted back to stock if I want to keep it long
term.  I don't want a bodywork project, I intend to just repair and keep up
from daily drive ruse, not turn a $1000 bus into a $7000 prize winner.

That said.  Here is what I'm asking if you have time.  Check out these
photos:

Tell me what you think a '64 in this condition is worth.  Let's keep it
simple, assume that a) NO ENGINE included in price.  b) Tranny is stock and
original but needs rebuilt, but is working.  c) I am concerned with being
able to RETURN to stock, but bolt-on changes like wheels and seats are not a
big deal to me.  d) not lowered or otherwise mucked with.

Don't get to hung-up on the interior.  It is fine with me for daily driver
use, and I don't consider that a terminal issue (it can be reverted to stock
later).  Same goes for the wheels!

I don't have photos of the rear cab floor, but all signs say we should
assume it is very good (no rust holes).

I really appreciate all the help on this.  This bus is more than my
previously stated price goals, and now I'm forced to consider all the &quot;too
expensive&quot; Crew Cabs I never looked into.

Honestly, without engine -- what would you pay for this?  It is in CA if
that helps you region the price.  I'm in Seattle.  Obviously, reply by
private mail and not to list.
