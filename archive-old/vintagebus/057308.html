Subject: Re: [VB] throwout bearing install...

This is on the old style throwout bearing only!

If you look at the throwout bearing housing, you will see a deep groove
that runs all the way around the outside, interrupted only by the two pins
that ride on the throwout fork.  The safety wire is routed through the
holes in the spring clips and then around the perimeter of the bearing
down in this groove between the flanges.  This keeps the spring clip in
place and keeps the safety wire out of the clutch.

&gt; We can not picture this safety wire routing, do you have a pic?
&gt; Does this then flex or bend with each clutch depression?
