Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Transmisson Seal

smell the puddle.  If it smells really icky sweet it is gear oil.   If it 
smells like engine oil its engine oil.  if it smell like gas it's gas.

if it's gear oil, put a hat on and look at your boots- scope out the 
situation- is it clearly leaking between engine and trans?  well, pull the 
motor.  ya ya.  okay- gear oil IN bellhousing?   then the seal is bad.  It 
rarely is.   If it is, pull TO bearing, and carfeully remove old seal with 
screwdriver (prying, do not scrapw where seal sits).  bent screwdriver is 
better.  There is a trick to it..  

but I'd suspect a axle boot first.

&lt;&lt;  Hello all knowing list :-) does someone out there know what it
 takes to remove a rear main seal in a tranny? The one next to the throw
 out bearing I believe that mine is shot and is in need of replacing. I
 just put in a new engine this weekend and it is as clean as can be but I
 have a dark brown puddle under my bus and it is coming from between the
 engine and the tranny. With brand new oil in the engine I am pretty sure
 it is not coming from there. I am bummed because I spent this weekend
 replacing this engine to find that my tranny is leaking too.
