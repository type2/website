Wanted:

Barndoor 'big diamond' reflectors wanted, here are the specs:  The size of the reflector is approximately 59mm.
It says &quot;Grese ~~~ K1282&quot; along the outer edge, there is no text on the glass lens itself.  The back of the lense is painted black and has a stud that comes out to mount it to the body.  The diamond pattern of the lense is shown on the left in this web link:
