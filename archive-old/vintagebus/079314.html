Subject: Re: [VB] (bad leak) too much oil?

&lt;...&gt;
Before you go pointing fingers, take your dipstick out
and see if it smells like gasoline.  It is a lot more
likely that your fuel pump diaphragm is ruptured and
overfilling your crankcase (and thinning your oil) than
a reputable shop would overfill your oil by 2 quarts.
The symptoms you describe are the exact symptoms of a
bad fuel pump.  More than likely you can just replace
the fuel pump and change the oil and your main seal is
fine.

&gt; Looked outside the other day and there's an oil
&gt; puddle, looks like about 12 to 16 FL. oz. of oil,
&gt; leaked enough to make about a 10-inch wide stain, and
&gt; run about 2-feet down the drive way.
&gt; I checked the dipstick and the oil line is about 1/2
&gt; inch above the top (second) line on the dipstick.
&gt; Is that too much oil? How would that happpen? And do
&gt; you think it resulted in the blown main seal?
&gt; Should I be pointing fingers, or writing checks?
