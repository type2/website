Subject: Re:  [VB] How fast am I going? (or, how slow?)

Engine is a 1500 SP with a 30 Solex carb.
Tires are P205/75 R14
Tranny is from Transform. The receipt (from PO) says
&quot;option: .82 4th&quot; Which I guess means freeway flier.

Given this configuration would this make the speedo
read slower than actual?
- - - - - - - - 

the only one of these that would affect the speedo  is the tires.   hm- not 
sure whst yesr Darth is-  with the 14&quot; rimd am guessing 64-67?   but  you 
have lager tires than stock, whch would make your speeo read a tad slower 
that real speedo.  The easiest way to translate your speedo i nto &quot;real&quot; 
speed that I can think of is compare with something like a freidn whos speedo 
you trust, or use a GPS thing.  now you know  how fast you are going.  how 
fast is everyone ese going?  in the bay area seems that people drive 70-75, 
which makes 55 feel kinda slow.   In other places 60-65 is what general 
speedo is, and 55 does not seem out of place.      I have learned an assetive 
driving style with an old split, including definately movements (I AM hnaging 
lanes into that spot) and the installation of a working 6V horn (even if bus 
is 12V- louder) so remind people that the bus is not a drive through.


the .82 4th is the bus 4th.     what makes it a freeway flier is the 3.88 
ring and pinion.  if the r&amp;p is 4.12 or 4.37 it is not FF   the gearing 
doen't affect the speedo anyway...  just the size of the tire on the L F, and 
what the speedo is calibrated to
