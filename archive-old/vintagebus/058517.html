Subject: Re: [VB] gas heater ramblings

No problem, glad you asked, pretty simple on the 6-12V conversion, I just
take the ground wire (black) from one blower and hook it to the power (red)
wire of the other blower.  Two 6V blowers in series is 12V!!  Pretty cool,
can't do that on an Eberspacher because they only have 1 blower for both the
combustion and heated air (which also make the cfm of the heated air much
lower in an Eberspacer)

&gt;&gt; Kevin, funny you should mention a 6V bug heater, that is what I am working
&gt;&gt; on today, along with Bryant's duel carbs on his bus, I am building a bug
&gt;&gt; heater for Matthew's bus that was 6V but with the connection of just 2 wires
&gt;&gt; turns it into a 12V.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been waiting for someone else to jump in on this one, but they haven't,
&gt; so,
&gt; OK, then- which two wires get connected to turn a 6V into a 12 V?
