&gt;ya- the list with dates would be interesting to look at -  do you have that 
&gt;on the computer somewhere?

Here you go.  It's not a very extensive list - the M-code list is longer
than this but lots of them don't have &quot;effective dates&quot; listed.

From the Doliwa book, the other splitty M-codes that have &quot;time&quot; notes 
on them:

&quot;To 1955&quot;:
M 52  Rear flap without window
M 53  Rear flap with window
M 57  Divided front seat and &quot;Bodenleisten lose beigelegt&quot;

&quot;Front, to 3/55&quot;:
M 93  Behr ventilator

&quot;To 3/55&quot;:
M 97  Emden radio, Rear bumpers (*1)

&quot;From 217 000 001&quot;:
M 102  Heated rear window

&quot;From 217 148 459&quot;:
M 114  Six pop-out side windows  (*2)

&quot;From 1 096 222&quot;:
M 161  Sliding door

&quot;To 216 190 000&quot;:
M 168  88 amp-hour battery

&quot;423 157 to 1 328 271&quot;:
M 199  Rotating driver's seat in camping car

&quot;From 1.10.64 Series&quot;:
M 215  1 ton weight rating + 1.5L
M 216  1.5L

&quot;To 215 190 000&quot;:
M 221  High roof with &quot;sales flap&quot; (Verkaufsklappe)

&quot;From 1.8.66 Series&quot;:
M 620  12v system

&quot;To 216 190 000&quot;:
M 621  12v warning light relay

My notes:

*1 I think this might be another one like 164: M 97 is rear bumpers
   until 3/55; sometime after that it means Emden radio

*2 This doesn't make any sense, as my '64 (1 203 065) has this code

&gt;In fact, it is officially a drought,  people are worrying about enough 
&gt;water for fishes, let alone hydroelectricity.

In Oklahoma and Texas we are getting plenty of rain...parts of Texas
are back to normal after near-drought conditions last year.  I noticed
on the news about the hydro thing...y'all don't have enough spare juice
to send to sunny California anymore.  I wonder how long before we see
posts like, &quot;How do I fix a weld on my Bus where I had to stop halfway
through because of a blackout?&quot;
