&gt; This guy wrote me as he found my crew cab page.  Anyway, check out
&gt; his web
&gt; site and hit [Next Page] on the bottom right.  This guy is SERIOUS
&gt; about
&gt; VW's!!

I don't think that have that level of commitment!  

Reminds me of the unofficial BMW motorcycle slogan (usually voiced
within earshot of Harley riders):  

&quot;Ride BMW motorcycles, no tattoo required!&quot;
