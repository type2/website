Subject: Re: [VB] That rattle - was this it?

may i suggest 2 things to maybe remedy this problem. first, check/replace
the shift rod bushing for the front shift rod. get a genuine vw one,
they're only about $5. second, try greasing the ball/ball socket of the
shifter/shift rod. pull the shifter off and pack it full down in the
socket. use good, thick, heavy grease.
another more of a PITA problem may be the 2 long shift rod bushings being
worn out. only way to fix that is to remove the tranny.



&gt; [Original Message] 
&gt; I also have an irritating rattle, comes and goes with engine vibration
(not
&gt; necessarily speed). When I put pressure on the shifter (push it further
into
&gt; the gear it is in), the rattle subsides. I think it's the shift rod,
perhaps
&gt; the ball and socket at the bottom of the stick. One of these days I'm
going
&gt; to try adjusting the position of the shifter on the floorboard to see if I
&gt; can quiet it down.

&gt; &gt; Some of you may recall the strange rattle I had at speed in my 60 panel.
&gt; &gt; (and some of you have even heard it, but not the cam rattle - that *is*
&gt; &gt; fixed)  It was an annoying rattle that came up thru the shifter.
