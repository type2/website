Subject: AridZona VW Show

http://www.wolfsburgregistryphx_dot_com/events.php

BBB VI was Vantastic-- I was able to find a few great VW treasures,
and the prices as always were VWonderfull--

Many thanks to The London Bridge Bullies for a job well done--

My only complaint was seeing a couple of &quot;Bay Window Boys&quot; frolicking in the
water ---scantily clad-- right after I had a bratwurst!--
