&gt; I also got lucky, my rear shifter bushing had tons of play making the bus 
&gt; almost undrivable, i was down there to add fluid to the tranny and happened 
&gt; to check it, the bolts were lose and it fixed it to working acceptably!

Hi Jason,
Make sure to safety wire those bolts and that the safety wire is placed in 
such a way to keep them tight!
