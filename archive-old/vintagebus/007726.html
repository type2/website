I finally got the rear drive train totally pulled out of Daisy (66 deluxe)
tonight.  I have a complete bus drivetrain sitting in my garage on a floor
jack with sawdust to catch the fluid.  There is so much gunk and crap, I've
had to dig for the nuts but I managed to remove the nosecone.  When I fired
up the the compressor, I blew a fuse so decided to quit for the night.

Anyway, during all of this,  I came up with some questions that I'd like to
have answered:

I had one helluva time getting the passenger door open.  I finally had to
remove the door handle and use a punch and hammer to trip the mechanism.
The door damn near fell off in my hands!  Turns out that the hinges on this
side are really bad - so much so that they've apparantly been rewelded
several times and now all I have left for hinges is a couple of rusty bars
of metal with the top hinge only swiveling on the broken welds.  I noticed
that this part of the hinge is welded to the door.  So I either need a new
door or a new hinge.  What's involved with this and who can help me out?

The hockeystick on the nosecone is wobbly.  I need to have a new bushing
installed.  Is there anyone on the list that does this or is it something I
can either do or have a machine shop do?

I was fortunate that rear shift coupler bolts came out rather easily as did
most of the bolts.   Go figure on why the rubber boot on the front of the
tranny (shiftrod) is in real good condition while the rest of the rubber
parts are not. :-)

Thanks for the answers with the door problem.  It's rather common and I
think most people end up getting another door don't they?
