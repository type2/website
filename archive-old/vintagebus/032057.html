I don't understand the following, because my 61 bus tachs out at 58 mph with 
its tranny (mystery  bought for $35 at a swap) and my 65s which was buildt by 
Todd Hill with a 3.88 r&amp;p, 1.26 RGears, .82 4th  tachs at 57 at 3K rpms.  
they tach almost identical, and I figre there may be a speedo slightly off to 
determine the up to circa1mph differnce in all gears.   This is speed my the 
speedo, my tires are bigger than stock, so am going faster than the 57/58 
mph.   as told by others on the road comparing to their speedos.

also get 3K in 3rd at 37 or 38mph by the speedo.   FYI

  I am definately  -not- getting 52mph at 3K.

I'd try the proven 3.88 R&amp;P, 1.26 reductions, and the .82 4th. Don't let
the tranny builder sneak in a .89 bug 4th though or you'll lose the
benefits of the 3.88 R&amp;P. It almost happened to me, the assembler said
it would have been easier to put in the .89 fourth. 

Here's what the numbers look like:

Final Drive : 5.14 ( 3.88 R&amp;P + 1.26 reduction )
Gear Ratio  : 0.89 Bug 4th
Tire Height : 25&quot;

With the first option, the gearing would be worse than a stock '64-'67
Bus assembly. Gene Berg has an interesting article on gearing which
should be required reading for all air cooled VW owners. 5 speeds are
beneficial to people that need close ratio gearing up to the stock
fourth, then they usually use a .89 for 5th gear so they can get home
&gt;from the race track without blowing up their engines.
