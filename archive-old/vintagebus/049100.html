Multi-vis oils... What makes them thick? Long chain polymers or some such alchemy. Whatever it is, it's added to the base oil (thin) to thicken it at high temps. What happens at high, air cooled engine temps? The polymers break down and the oil reverts to the base or thin consistency. So if you start with a 10-50 in the summer and heat it past the oil's high temp (dare you to find it on oil producer's spec sheets) the alchemy breaks down, won't work it's magic anymore, and you're running a thin 10 weight oil. We run a lot hotter than water cooled engines. Guess what 98% of engines are cooled by? Unless ambient temps never reach 80, use single viscosity 40 in the summer. If ambients get below 30, or you have cold cranking problems, use a multi-vis in the winter, otherwise, use 30 weight in the winter, 40 in summer. Multi-vis wasn't invented for 5 million VW's, it was invented for 30 million Detroit POS's.
