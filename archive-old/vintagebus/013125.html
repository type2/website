A friend of mine has picture of a single cab that had air intakes above the cab that went below the bed to the engine.  Haven't seen the bus in person, although someone else said the first friend above actually owns that bus now.  I should ask.  

My double cab had vents that went over the cab, under the bed and to the engine compartment.  All I have are holes, but a long ago previous owner told me that was what was there.  He did say these particular ones did not look factory.

was writ:


How common is or how many were made of the single cab ute's with no air vents 
on the side of the vehicle. The over head peak on the cab is alot longer to 
channel the air to the motor.
 - -  -  --  -
1.   whatsa &quot;ute?&quot;    

2. the overhead lip on the cab is passenger ventilation, not motor.

3.  single cabs have engine vents to let the air in for the motor.
