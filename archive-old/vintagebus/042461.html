Okay,

the scoop i got was this:

the T3 oil cooler is the same size and shape as a doghouse oil cooler.
What you do is use the upright doghouse braket with the t3 cooler. It fits
into the doghuse tin perfectly, but the boss on it for the oil pressure
switch on a t3 will hit the tin and not allow it to go in...

So, you have to trim a slot in the &quot;doghouse&quot; for the oil pressure switch
boss that is on the t3 cooler.  You will have to plug this with a 1/8 NPT
plug (or use it for your oil pressure switch if you have a t3 case... or
use it for an oil pressure gague etc.)

it sounds to me like a better idea than the T4 cooler as you dont have to
hack the heck out of your tin to such a degree...  Bigger isnt always
better in this case... since the cooling passages in the t3 cooler are
more dense, it cools better than the same size doghouse cooler.  Dunno if
it cools better than a t4 cooler or not, but i bet its pretty close (my
guess)

hope that helps...

Steve
