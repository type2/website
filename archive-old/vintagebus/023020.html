I just got home from my John Howard sponsored weekend.  A lot of fun, but
exhausting!   The bus ran great all the way home, I was able to maintain 65
most of the way up, with the exception of the grapevine.   The outside temp
was about 90, and the bus barely failed the dipstick test after the grapevine.

Once I got into Sacramento county, the weather cooled off enough that 70
was no problem.  Didn't find too many deals at the Classic swap.  All the
prices went up from the day before.  One guy had a barndoor single cab FS;
it went up $1000 between the two days.

Yes, I have the radio, Craig.
