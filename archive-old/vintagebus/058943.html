Excellent trip report, the long trips are usually the best because of the
unknown. I remember my trip in 96 in a 79 westy from Los Angeles all the way
to Georgia by myself, although I was alone it still was the best trip
because of all the people I met along the way .

Subject: [VB] trip report--kinda long


What a trip!!!  I can?t say it enough times.  This was by far the best
vacation I have ever taken.  For those of you who don?t know, approximately
one month ago I made arrangements to purchase a 1958 VW Single Cab from Mike
Gensler in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  It was determined that a one-way
flight would provide the best means of arriving at the vehicle.
On Saturday, April 27, 2002, I boarded a direct flight from Kansas City
International Airport to the Springs.  Saturday was a full of errands to
prepare for the trip.  I picked up a Grateful Dead sticker and a statue of
my favorite traveling god, Buddha.  I also bought a small socket set at Pink
Newell?s recommendation.  Pink and his family provided the necessary send
off.  Thanks guys!!!
The plane ride provided a very interesting conversation with one of the most
radiant individuals I have ever met. We enjoyed a delightful conversation
about the trials of her life a single mom and the long distant relationship
with her significant other, Joe.  Her 28 month old was perfect.  I was a bit
worried when I sat down.  I actually got to carry the little guy off the
plane.  I?m gonna have to get a Micro-buskatier someday.
Mike picked me up at the airport in his 1973 Westy fitted with a Porsche
engine and five-speed tranny.  WOW.  I need to comment on Mike?s generous
hospitality.  He is one heck of a guy.  His girlfriend, Wendy, and friend
Dave Russell, were great hosts!!!  Thanks guys!!!  After some great beer and
a meal, Mike and I went off to find Zorm.  What a bus.  I knew it was mine
when I noticed the paint.  Probably the exact same color as my 1969 Westy.
The color is non-VW and we estimate both vehicles were in Dallas at
painting.  Could be the same shop.  You never know.  By this time it was
pretty late, so we headed off to bed.
The next morning found a photo session followed by breakfast at Wendy?s
place.  We ran some errands and drove Zorm a bit, before returning to Mike?s
place for the afternoon activities.  A few small tasks were completed on
Zorm.  We also prepared for an upcoming cookout that would include Steve
Walters and family of Boulder, Colorado, and Dan Jensen and son Wade.  I?d
like to thanks these folks for taking time out of their day to stop by.  I
really enjoyed meeting everyone.  There were six busses at Mike?s house,
which seemed to motivate the neighbors to draw their shades.
By the time everyone headed home it was pretty late and I had to get ready
for a long couple days of driving.  Mike gave me a quick lesson on carbs and
I headed off to bed a very happy and excited bus owner.
Monday morning found me up extra early.  Go figure.  I picked up my mess,
took a shower, and made some sandwiches before Mike woke up.  I was eager to
hit the road and called my grandfather who was serving as dispatch in case
of emergency.  I checked the oil and had Mike take a few pictures before
pulling out of the driveway.  I can?t explain the excitement.  I have heard
that an adventure is a trip you go on with no real way of knowing how or if
you will get back.  I was pretty sure I?d make it back to KC, one way or the
other, but I had no idea what milestones would stand in my path.
The first milestone was getting out of the Colorado Springs.  Thanks to my
typical maleness and a strange inability to turn around, I took the long way
through town.  Doht!!!  I did see a pretty nice old bug.  With the addition
of a tachometer and oil pressure gauge, I had a lot more information than I
am conditioned to inputting.  The oil pressure valve is from an Audi to
match the gauges and is reportedly set to trigger the idiot light before the
stock valve.  The tripped me out big time.  Watching the gauge as I traveled
up and down the hills was also a bit nerve wrecking.
I lost my speedometer cable and became concerned about the oil about thirty
miles out of Kit Carson, Colorado.  I pulled over and took a couple of
pictures before checking the oil and disconnecting the cable from the body
of the bus.   This allowed me to stretch my legs and take a good luck at the
bus on the side of the road.  Happy Day.
After adding over 14 gallons of gas in Kit Carson, I became a little
concerned.  I had traveled a maximum of 160 miles.  This made my stomach
hurt.  If this was going to be the gas mileage for my trip, I was in for an
expensive couple of days.  After buying some additional oil and visiting
with the man behind the counter I headed off.
Fifty miles later in Sharon Springs, I added three gallons of gas which
means I did not get the tank all the way full when I was in Colorado Springs
on Sunday night.  Doht!!!!  You would have thought I?d landed a UFO at this
gas station.  The kid pumping gas and an old farmer spent the better part of
20 minutes inspecting the truck.  They about flipped when I hooked up the
semaphores.
On to Dighton, Kansas, for my next tank of gas.  The Kwik Shop was across
from the bank.  At gas stations I pull in, go to the bathroom, pump my gas,
pay for the gas, and then check the oil.  This allows me to let the engine
cool down the most.  I noticed that a group of white shirt and tie-clad men
were standing in the lobby of the bank staring at my VW.  I waved.  They
sheepishly waved back.  After about five minutes, on of them pocked his head
out of the door and yelled, ?What year is that VW??  I replied and he stuck
his head back in.  They should have walked across the street for a better
look.  I wanted to pull a line from the cult-favorite, Pee-Wee Herman road
trip movie and yell, ?Take a picture?it will last longer.?  Fun stuff.
From Dighton, I made it into Hays, Kansas, without a hitch.  I dropped stuff
at my brother?s place and headed off to see Steve Reed.  Steve will provide
me with a key/ignition solution at BBBB later this month.  I don?t think he
is on the list right now, but I really appreciated his help and anticipate
is return to the Buskatier list.  He was a very cool place and is hoping to
host a campout/grand opening for the folks headed off to the RMMW show in
August.  I think he has is hopes set on becoming Western Kansas?s VW man.
Good work STEVE!!!!  After giving Steve a ride, I headed back to my
brother?s place for some food, a movie and sleep.
I gassed up Tuesday morning and found the bus needed no oil.  Maybe my leak
wasn?t as bad as I thought.  A trip though Burger King?s drive through and a
call to grandpa started the drive off.  I make it from Hays to Hutchinson,
Kansas, in just over 2.5 hours.  Nice speed.  The air was cool and I even
cranked open the heater.
I picked up grandpa and we headed off to the Buggy Shop to see about a
Speedo cable.  I picked up a used one for six bucks.  We sent to Sears.  My
grandpa wanted to get me a set of jack stands for graduation.  I cashed in
on the $99 3-ton jack deal Isiah told us about last week.  Grandpa got to
give me a set of jack stands and didn?t spend a dime.  He did slip me a $20
for gas.  I love that guy!!!
After a lunch from Grandma, the three of us replaced the Speedo cable on
their street; with the oil leak I didn?t want to put in on their driveway.
It must have been funny to see the three of us working away.  Grandma
commented each time someone drove by looking at us weird.  Grandpa insisted
on jumping in to see if the cable worked.  It promptly broke.  Foiled
again!!!
I went to get gas and a 1974 VW passenger van pulled in behind me.  The
owner wanted to give mine a looking over.  I asked if his van had been
parked at a certain street during the late 1980?s.  He said that is where he
lived.  Another bus from my childhood.  How cool!!!  After chatting for
about 20 minutes, I headed off in hopes of making it to Lawrence by 6:30
p.m., in order to meet up with my oldest friend Adam Koch.  Four and one
half hours might be cutting it close.  Of course I took the back roads and
enjoyed the most beautiful drive in Kansas.  I traveled on highway 4 south
of Abilene all the way across to Burlington.  Amazing!!!  I added gas in
White City, Kansas.  The lady behind the counter needed to know the story.
Every fill up has a great story?pretty cool.  I made it to Lawrence in time
to meet Adam and then drove on to Atchison.
I have no idea how many miles I drove, but it was on heck of a good trip.  I
never really feared engine failure, but was quite relieved to make it home
without incident.  The overwhelming theme of the trip is the willingness of
other folks, both VW and otherwise, to stand by for assistance if necessary.
  All I can say is Thank You!!!  Here is the short list of folks who were on
call and/or provided their time to make my trip better.  Mike Gensler and
Wendy, Dave Russell, Steve Walters, Dan and Wade Jenson, Steve Reed, Joe
Ramsey, John and Jan Leach, Keith Petite, Rick Taylor, Sylvia Reynolds, and
Kathleen Lowman.  Not only did some these folks feed or shelter me, the
others would have dropped what they were doing to come offer assistance as
needed.  The best part about the VW hobby is the people.  Rick Taylor once
commented that I have come a long way in short amount of time in the world
of VW?s.  This is only because of the cool people who consistently make
air-cooled VW?s the only way fly.  I can?t begin to mention those who have
inspired me in my adventures.  THANK YOU ALL, SO MUCH!!!!

I wake up every morning determined both to change the world and have one
hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
