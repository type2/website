Subject: RE: [VB] IRS on a Split

I've got an IRS conversion on my DC from Old Speed that the PO had put in.
From what I can tell its type 1 tranny, with rabbit CVs, and I believe type
3 brakes.  I still haven't been able to quite decipher what all they got
going on back there, and keep meaning to call but always get caught up in
other things.

The IRS conversion is such a variable thing it is hard to say what is right
or wrong depending on the path you want to go down.

The only Thing components I know of that are used in a regular swap is the
IRS tranny and/or inner flanged for the CVs.  I have never seen Thing CVs
used.  Normally people use the baywindow CVs 28 degree working angle or the
T4 CVs with a 32 degree working angle (expensive like $75 each).

Check out Bus Boys for details on what seems to be the route you are going.
Volksworld did a DIY article on this a while ago as well.

From my research you will need to buy modified axles, control arm mounts
(clamp on or welded), and maybe spring plates.

Old Speed has a stock height kit that uses Beetle stuff...  Which means you
can put early 944 rear brakes on it :)   Or T3 brakes.

The shop talk forum usually has loads of custom information if you want to
check it out.
