Is anyone else's head spinning???  I think I lost it about half way down.  I'll
need to re-read that post at least a few more times.  Good stuff though.  BTW,
my Feb. 23rd '62 crew cab has the gate bumpers and the lower body bumpers at
the rear.  Only gate bumpers on the tale gate.

&gt; &gt;the parts number quoted in the 'gate stops section' from the 58 ed
&gt; parts list also shows these two choices.  HM?   The only explanation I can
&gt; think offor
&gt; this is that the 58 ed he checked was updated for the 59 model year
&gt;
&gt; You should know what edition it is..it was your &quot;58&quot; parts manual i got the
&gt; info from, remember?
&gt; =) (see archives, search for     single NEAR cab NEAR originality)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I will want to cross references this in other editions of the parts list.
&gt; (this is why I like to collect parts list of diff years)&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Kool lemme know what you find out, ive asked the list before for cross
&gt; references on this subject, but it seems like your the only one who collects
&gt; parts
&gt; manuals heh
&gt;
&gt; &gt;This 63 definitely has threaded holes in the belt line at
&gt; &gt;the front end of the dropsides. Just like the threaded holes in the cargo
&gt; &gt;doors for their rubber buffers.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever seen a gate that DIDN'T have threaded holes at the front?
&gt; (not counting a thrashed gate) Far as i know they all had that. Which makes
&gt; that spot the only definite size, since there is only one size that comes
&gt; with a built in threaded bolt, but thats refering to the repops companies,
&gt; so once again..a grey area.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;AT the rear of the dropsides there is a hole
&gt; &gt;in the beltline, you can see through it.
&gt;
&gt; Thats how they all are including the early rear gates...screw/nut on
&gt; backside on all gates cept for the
&gt; front threaded insert.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Straight below the rear hole in the dropsides, near the engine vents, just
&gt; forward of the seam to the rear corner is a hole on the left side...
&gt;
&gt; So far from what i've learned by studying pictures and factory lit is that
&gt; started in either 62 or 63 (my opinion is late late 62/early 63...Or the
&gt; beggining of 62 if you go by WCM's catalog.). Ive seen factory
&gt; literature showing both with and without for both 62 and 63.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;so what goes in the side spots?
&gt;
&gt; (Refering to side body stops): Every mid/late 60's truck ive seen has 25mm's
&gt; there, but thats not sayin much since everyone is scrapin there og dry
&gt; rotted ones and slappin on whatever WW gives them. Speaking of WW, i noticed
&gt; they just recently changed their online catalog...and they are now calling
&gt; out the small 10mm (?) to go on the side body spot for 63 and later
&gt; http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgibin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=211841691A ...but they
&gt; also call it a DOOR STOP and say it fits ALL years up to 74, so who knows
&gt; what the hell their talkin about. guess i better get out the drill and add
&gt; spots to my 57 since they say it needs it.
&gt; WCM is sayin the 40mm is for &quot;long beds, side gate, bottom&quot;...so 40mm for
&gt; the side body spots, ok, buuuttt they say up to 61. Jeez, no sense. Longbed?
&gt; is that a single cab? they referenced &quot;pickup&quot; in the rubber stop
&gt; description right above that..... if its actually the side gates UPPER rear,
&gt; then 40mm up to 61, and in 62 the body bumper was added, so then thats sayin
&gt; the size for the side bumper gates at rear changed once the side body stop
&gt; was added, which agrees with what you say below. My bro-inlaws 66 has 40mm's
&gt; on the rear upper gate, and what looks like 25mm on the body sides. It all
&gt; looks to be original.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If there is a buffer on the body as well as on the gates, but only on the
&gt; rear, one might think you would use a shorter stopper on the rear part of
&gt; the gate.
&gt; Parts list  (70? ed) shows two choices:
&gt; 261 829 575 rubber buffer 26x15 dropside -use 4
&gt; 261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24 dropside -use 4
&gt; SO the parts lists says use the same buffer for all 4 places on the gates,
&gt; and ignores the spot for the rear buffer to bump against.
&gt;
&gt; Im wonderin if sometime in the early 60s, they stopped puttin rubber stops
&gt; on the rear gate, since i see soo many rear gates without those holes. If
&gt; thats true i think thats Euro only, due to the continuation
&gt; of the rear body stops. either that or 5 million people got happy with
&gt; bondo, but if that parts list is right, then they added them again in the
&gt; late 60s or else thats an american parts list only........
&gt;
&gt; &gt;In the pics I looked at, none of the stamped bumper trucks had the lower
&gt; rear buffer, and a fair percentage of the later bumper trucks did.  Why is
&gt; it not listed?  hm- check other lists..
&gt;
&gt; Early had stops on gate and rear body, then in 59 they dropped the rear
&gt; body stops (cept for euro?).... I
&gt; think thats where the 40mm stops come in, used on the spots next to decklid
&gt; on euro.
&gt; Noticing on thesamba_dot_com, pictures sayin &quot;original SC&quot; which im sure people
&gt; said it was, but every hole on all the gates are filled in,  cant trust the
&gt; pics.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I called WW, to see what they said about buffers on trucks of years, to see
&gt; what they thought of what rubber buffers were used where,specifically on
&gt; this63 SC and talked to Oscar.  He did not seem to be sure of the buffer
&gt; use...
&gt;
&gt; As stated on my site, WW was worthless to me when tryin to decide. They have
&gt; no clue. I asked for a 36hp tip for my BUS and they send me a bug one cause
&gt; they were out of bus ones....its
&gt; sales not correctness. I ask for stoppers for my 57sc and they sent me
&gt; every style they had cause they dont know....
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What exactly does the '26x15' and
&gt; &gt;28x25' in the VW parts list mean?  width and height in mm I suppose, so the
&gt; &gt;OG ones were 15mm high and 25mm high. plus the mystery size tailboard ones
&gt; &gt;'for home market'
&gt;
&gt; Assuming home market meant Euro which references the NON overrider
&gt; bumper..so in late years, it still had the body stop one each side of
&gt; decklid ..But the 58 manual is talking about the rear gate (tailboard) and
&gt; still calling out the same part number (did you do a typo when quoting the
&gt; 58 manual? is it actually 265 instead of 261 part #?) so why do they even
&gt; mention it unless their talkin about the body BELOW the tailboard instead,
&gt; which would make sense and mean 40mm on the rear body OR its an american
&gt; manual only......? Anyway if its actually 265 part # and its actually a late
&gt; 58/early 59 manual,  and assuming  the above about euro not having anything
&gt; on the rear gate, it
&gt; must be 40mm from 59 and on the rear of body next to decklid is the
&gt; conclusion i have drawn on that for Euro only.... Anyone have a late 60's
&gt; Euro truck? does it have holes for the rubber stops on both sides of the
&gt; engine lid? What about on the reat gate?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;dunno that these idea fits nicely into the categories listed on Wade's drop
&gt; &gt;gates stop buffer page.
&gt;
&gt; Yah after finding out about all the diff years of lengths and starting and
&gt; stopping
&gt; holes and etc, ive been redoing the page, will update soon.
