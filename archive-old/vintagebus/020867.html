Subject: Sundial based on a Kombi

&gt; Isn't the Kombi the basis for the Westy?  That would
&gt; explain why you had the Kombi manual.  

&gt;And the panel was the basis for the Sundial, Riviera,
etc.


Don't know why some many people think that Sundial
conversions are always based on a panel...my 67 is
based on a kombi as many other Sundials I have seen.
