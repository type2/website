Ok. I FINALLY got the van to start. Once again, running an 009, 32/36 Weber,
1600 dual port, newly rebuilt (not by me). I start it up, backfires a little
bit, sometimes more, than it revs REALLY high once it starts and won't slow
down. WHAT IS WRONG?! I'm so close to getting it to run, yet still so far
away...sigh. Please help anyway you can. I am inches from putting the Toyota
up for the summer...ahh. Thanks for any help.
