List- Please help me to answer this question (its bring driving me crazy for 
several years now): you know panels,kombis, standards,and probably others 
were equipped with rubber bumpers mounted to the side of the vehicle that 
served to protect the body from damage when one of the vehicle doors was 
opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the side cargo doors. On 
the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the check strap ONLY to 
obviously protect the side of the vehicle (in this case the aluminum 
beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were the non-DeLuxe 
buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
_______________________________________

I think the check strap on the front cargo door is  usefu for keeping the 
door from opening  so far that the cab door hits it when opened.  the front 
check strap where it goes anto the body has that easy release feature.  
Sometimes I want it open all the way and I release it, usually I keep the 
check strap attached so it opens 90*

the rear check strap- well mt 65 westy didn't have one.  The bumpers are 
nice.  Took me over a year after painting the bus to install the new rubber 
bumpers.    Before that I had a towel I would hang over the uppper hinge so 
the door didn't bang and scrape.  Bumpers are better.   I dunno why most 
buses have a rear check strap.  Probably to keep it from banging,remove it if 
you want the door open all the way.

But you can't put the bumpers throughthe deluxe trim can you?
