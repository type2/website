Subject: RE: [VB] today's 'what NOW' engine build problem :)

well, yes, grind it where it is has occurred to me - not sure if i 
have the skilz/toolz. what tool would you suggest? not taking my 5&quot; 
disc grinder near the case! i have a dremel, but i doubt i have bits 
strong enough. plus, one slip and byebye main bearing! :P

as far as i'm concerned, dpr is on the same plane as most every shop 
i've run into on this job - shit. do lots of work here? we'll pay 
attention. onesies twosies? give the work to the new guy.....

nwcon rod and ronnie have been the only positive things about this 
motor so far.
