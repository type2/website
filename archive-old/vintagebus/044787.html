While a splittie in a regular junk yard may be uncommon in San Diego, I hope
every one in the area knows about Interstate VW Wrecking in Vista.
760-598-1376. I have never seen less than 5 splitties available in near whole
condition, and lots of already stripped parts. Last I needed stuff, I sorted
through about 25 right front doors to pick out what i needed. I also got a
good condition used front clip etc. They do VW only and have lots of stuff.
Since they know what antique VW stuff is worth, you may not get parts for $5
that you would at a full service (ignorant of VW) wrecking yard, but they
have california sheet metal with little rust.
