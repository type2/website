Subject: Be on the lookout for beige hightop

Just a note to keep a weather eye out for Jacques
and Joe of Yakima. They just left our place here on Vancouver is and their
bus has some brake issues.

Typical VW trip- they come to pu some westy parts and we notice some brake
fluid dripping from rear wheel. No problomo-we order up a wheel cyl-dont
have time to pull the wheel-go to go to work and they need to rest up.
Next morn pull wheel-yup-needed that wheel cyl, plus the brake pad that is
more metal than pad.

Did we mention the brake res was leaking too? What is it called when you
jerry rig, a jerry rig? Anyway, new wheel cyl, new brake shoe and rigged
hose and their homeward bound. Keep them in your thoughts for a safe trip
home.

(yes there are bus people on the Is, but just now cleaned up and came in
 )  )
