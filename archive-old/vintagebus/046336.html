&lt;&lt; My Bus always has this GAS smell, inside and out.  Not sure why but
 everytime I drive it I smell gas, and when I get out I smell like I just got
 done driving a Go-Cart.  Also I started it today and it was backed up to the
 curb and the exhaust pipe was facing the curb.  After I turned it off there
 was black stuff all over the curb, I guess its carbon ?  Any ideas ?  keep
 in mind I'm the new-bee and dont know sh%_at_t

Hi Jason,
Do you have the proper carb jets installed for your year VW and engine?  If so
did you check all three (and sometimes four) jets to make sure that they
matched the jet size number on them?  Did this resently for Clara.  When she
would bring her VW over for us to look at there was a overwhelming over rich
unburnt fuel cloud behind her bus.  Which was real good at getting a person
light headed in very little time while working on the engine while it was
running.  While she had gotten used jets of the correct size according to the
stamped numbers on them.  All of them were way off due to the wear of
thousands of gallons of fuel going through them and being drilled by DPOs.
When rejetted properly the exaust was clean smelling and we will be interested
to see how much her MPG has gone up with these changes (Hint,hint Clara....)
