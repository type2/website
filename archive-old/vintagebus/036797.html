 What do the inner front door handles look like on a '67 deluxe.  The ones 
 that came with my van look like toilet flushers!  These got misplaced 
 somehow, but I don't believe they are stock anyway.  Anyone have a picture 
 or a description?  And, where can I pick up some NOS ones?
 Thanks,
  &gt;&gt;
they are short flippers.  Chrome for deluxe.  attached through handle to 
mechanism with a screw.  These short flippers came on 66/67s and the door 
also got a pull handle to close it, just a plastic handle attached at the top 
of the door panel, original door pulls are usually broken, but they are 
reproed now.
