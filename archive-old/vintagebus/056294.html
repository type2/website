Subject: Happy Birthday

Hi All,

On May 19, 1959, my double cab rolled off the assembly line as # 469869.
The first day of production for vehicles with the *bastard* 40 hp engine and
a tunnel type transaxle.

Gift selections should be directed towards any of the following items:

- 10 gas tank divider screws, phillips head, similar to a safari window dash
tab screw.
- rear headliner piece
- original one eyed duck
- red tip for my hirschmann antenna

Believe it or not, this is the ENTIRE list!!!!!!!!
(thanks to those that sent me the 5mm Kamax splash pan bolts...)

...Well, that is if the bed slat screws and the 6V vwoa battery that were
promised to me actually do arrive at my door someday... and I still list a
few other items on my 'wanted' page but those would either be for spares or
for a few other busses out there that I know need the same parts, or just
out of the possibilities that I find parts in nicer condition than what I
currently have....
