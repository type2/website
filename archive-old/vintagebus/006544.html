heck, fly into beautiful lake havasu
then drive one of my or another LBB bus up there
beautiful 6 hr bus drive through senic az. on the old route 66
spend an hour climbing a hill in second gear or
drag racing along the highway in third, watch the weather
and surroundings change as we drive, set up camp
cruise down to the ABC caravan and come up a different way with them,
there's plenty of ways to come, it just depends on how
much time you have, we in havasu make it a short vacation
then you'll have to come out for BUSES by the BRIDGE IV
in havasu, the weekend before the super bowl Y2K, first show
of the new millinium
