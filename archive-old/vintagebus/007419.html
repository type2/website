&gt;Well, I didn't see this vehicle, but I'm going to speak up. Its amazing to me 
&gt;that I and others who customize busses (correctly not cheaply) are 
&gt;criticized, yet a &quot;junker&quot; like this is praised!

I could not agree more, Jerry!


In my opinion, this is the way to restore the a bus:

-Fix ALL the rust (for safety)

-Then fix the brakes (no need to fix brakes on a unsalvable bus)

-Fix the suspension (steering and shocks)

-Electrical (Lights to keep it safe)

-Fix the mekanical (gearbox and engine)

-Then the paint (to stop it from rusting)

-Rubber (to keep the interior dry)

-Interior

If you were to be stopped by the Police in Norway with any major rust on your car, you would lose your license plates until the rust is fixed. It may be tough, but it keeps the roads safe.
