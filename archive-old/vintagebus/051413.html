Subject: Lucky find for Beto's '63EZ Camper!

Whoo hoo! It's a good day to be Beto Pina, current owner of my old 1963 EZ
Camper. I just ran across a stash of OG documents for that bus. The forgotten
stash includes:
* Original CA registration info Service Booklet with Starting at Sept 30 1963
with the vehicle VIN and warranty number inside, stamped by the dealer of sale
with tickets remaining starting with 9000 mile Lubrication and Maintenance
Service.

* Booklet: Volkswagen and Dealers of North America&quot; stamped inside with:
Lee-Wood Motors Inc
16114 E. Whittier Blvd. -- Whittier
oWen 1-1731

oWen line is how the telephone numbers used to be &quot;when I was a kid&quot;.
Literally. My old numer was ALpine 8 7600 when I lived in Phoenix 19 Arizona. I
dont remember now what the 19 was all about but basically was a prehistoric ZIP
code/Mail RT number.

Owners manual INSTRUCTION MANUAL
October 1962
(same stamp as above) =)

OG EZ Camper literature that matches the stash that the Busfarmers found a few
years ago.

License plate stickers that were piled up on the plate about 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; thick!!!
Reg cards: and Pink from OG owner to the second owner who lived in Merced and
likewise to the third owner who was apparently stationed at Castle Airforce
Base. That was the DPO who sold it to me.
Bill of sale from OG owner to DPO#2 for **200 Dollars** 14/Oct 1994

Rex Eastman once asked me if my bus came from Merced as one just like it used
to bomb around up there... At the time I could not confirm nor deny.

There is a pile of California State reg cards back to at least 1977.

After a long crappy week it was refreshing to find something positive. I could
be totally cool and pass the documents to Beto for that good old Kharmic Circle
Insurance and to show that when you buy vehicles from me that you get more (in
a positve way) than you pay for. Beto mentioned that he previously had trouble
proving history of the black plates that I gave him when I sold the bus.  
Ah screw it. I'm going to the dump early Saturday and I don't think Beto would
want this pile of junk.
