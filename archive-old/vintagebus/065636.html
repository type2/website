Subject: Re: [VB] From east to west , and back

FWIW, I talked with my father-in-law down in Borrego Springs night before 
last.  They were having their first rain in three years.  There actually 
might be wildflowers next spring. (If it keeps raining...) ;o) The drought 
has been so severe in the southern desert that his fifty year old cactii 
(suguaro) have died.

&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; Do both routes!  One on the way out, and the other on the way back.  Make 
&gt; sure to check out Meteor Crater, Carlsbad Cavern, plus the museum in Boron CA 
&gt; near Edwards AFB, and we have heard that seeing the VLA (As everyone has seen 
&gt; in the movie &quot;Contact&quot;) is worth it on your desert route.  Late spring after 
&gt; the rains turn loose the green and flowers and before the seasonal weather 
&gt; heats up is the best time for either/both routes.
