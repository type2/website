&gt; They cost 9DM, and they will sell and ship them to me. The only prolem is they require a minimum order of 100DM.
&gt;
...
&gt; byt the way how much is a DM? in US dollars.
&gt;
A little Yahoo Currency birdie ( http://finance.yahoo_dot_com/m3?u )told me it's $4.75.

I'm in for 2 sets, if a bulk order is needed.
