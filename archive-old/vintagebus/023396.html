Hey anyone out there know or have pics of Barndoor or mid 50's hardtop
deluxes (15 windows including rear corner windows) and know their
possible color combos. Just curious. I haven't seen any examples.

yes,  a few, they came the same colour as the 23 indow sambas.  (SWR/CB).  
One even had a bunch of original interior left.
