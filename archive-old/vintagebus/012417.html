hello everybody,  I am looking for an easy way to take the drums off my 
67 microbus.  I took the wheeles off in the front and the bolts are on 
so tight, how or what do you use to brace the drums so they dont move 
while you screw the bolts off.  Any helpful hints will be greatly 
appreciated.  Thanks again   peace out
