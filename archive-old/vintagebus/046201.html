&lt;&lt; Once sludge gets in your engine, how do you get it out. My oil filler on 
my type 1 engine is filled with a pudding like sludge from the engine not 
warming up enough in the cold weather. &gt;&gt;
Hi Skid,
Okay that is not sludge, but instead a water/oil mixture caused by not having 
the engine reach proper operating temperature.  You will just have to change 
the oil over and over again until you get the thermostatic flaps/bellows in 
place.
  We recommend not using engine cleaners to remove internal sludge.  
Especially in instances with unknown mystery engines that have been sitting 
unused for periods of longer than a couple of months.  Cleaners are all to 
likely to cause an avalanch of sludge to go and plug the oil passageways 
and/or oil cooler (BTDT with four different engines by just driving highway 
speeds!).  In the case of a runnable mystery engine you are better to run it 
in town (Stop and go driving!) for the first 300-500miles doing about 30 
minute drives here and there.  All the while changing the engine case oil 
about every 50 miles or at least until the oil stops turning black.  This not 
only slowly gets the sludge loose and out, but also allows the surfaces 
inside of the engine to polish themselfs clean if still possible.  At worse 
with driving it only in town you will only have to have it towed a short way 
home!   Eric&amp;Barb
