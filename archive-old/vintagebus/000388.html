&lt;&lt; l am soon to take apart the front end on my 64. I think it has a newer 
front end because it has an anti-sway bar attached.&gt;&gt;
The stock ant-sway bars were installed on earlier buses so that would not 
nessassarly mean the front end is newer.

&lt;&lt; I have taken apart front ends as far as removing and rebuilding the king 
pin assemblies but never taken out the torsion bars. What holds them in and 
are there any dangers in removing them? I want to inspect all of them because 
the front seems to be sitting a little lower than it should.  &gt;&gt;
Essentially the trailing arms, and the center lock stud in each torsion tube 
holds in the torsion bar leaf springs.  Also check for wear in the outer 
torsion tube bushings and/or needle bearings.  1964 used a outer bushing, 
inner needle bearing on the inner side of the torsion tube to trailing arms.  
1965 on used only needle bearings.  The latter is better.  It would be 
interesting to find out for sure if the 1964 outer bushings could be replaced 
with needle bearings.  Which looks possible to us.  Eric&amp;Barb
