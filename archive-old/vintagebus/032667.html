yes, this was stock. they attach to that screw and loop around the metal
line and have a rubber liner to protect the line. 
i used to find alot of these, especially on dual port motors. my thought is
that is kept vibration down so the line wouldn't rub on the front tin and
wear a hole in the line, but that's just my thought.  vw engineers would
never spent the time to think of something like that! :)

&gt; I used to have a old German mechanic that when ever I would bring him a
new car to work on, it would always come back with the fuel line (metal)
secured to the left side of the fan shroud.  He would always scold me when
they weren’t there. 
&gt; The line went through a small bracket that was attached via the screw
that held the shroud to the #3/#4 top cylinder tin.  I think I've seen this
in a factory book, but not sure.  Was this stock?
