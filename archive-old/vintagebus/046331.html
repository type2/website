You said it all when you said 38 years of Crud it just ain't gonna come of
that easy.
The problem is (i think) collateral damage. If you pull he engine and go at
it with
a power washer you take a chance of blowin thru something of maybe doing some
electrical damage if you use a heavy duty cleaner you run the risk of not
getting it all out. I have been thru this with both my Bus's and just
wrestled with it till i was finshed. If  i where you I  would get 2 six packs
of beer some soap and water a hard
brissel brush and make a day of it. I might be being kind of a Wus but
eveytime i've tryed to short cut a PITA job i wound up haveing to fix
something that wasn't broke
