Subject: Re: [VB] Speaker Location and running wire???

Hi Dave in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion the DPO drilled holes 
through the front door pillars and fed the wire through the window frame access 
holes in the doors.  You might be alot happier installing brackets 
under/inside the dash to face the speakers downward and toward the rear.  That way the 
speakers have alot less problems with water that flows through the doors and 
less hacking on the bus.
