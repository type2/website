Subject: Support your FLAPS (NOT)

This is something I have to disagree with, why?

Because this is something that crosses all state and international
boundaries, the fact that some repair places should be shut down because
of bad, incompetent service.

I will not call names but this FLAPS is a JOKE when it comes to
repairing VW's. I can think of at least 3 people that have driven away
in a &quot;repaired&quot; vehicle only to have it break down on the way home, one
girl even CRASHED her bus into another car after they did a complete
brake job. Did they correct any of these problems, NO!!!! I can't
believe this place is still in business. I have no personal grip with
them, just the fact that they have hurt the name of Volkswagens in our
area, they have NEVER worked on any of my VW's and I warn every newbie
to my town NOT to go to this place. And yes I usta buy parts from this
place because they where one of two places you could buy parts, BUT
CONVERSATION AIN'T WORTH THEIR PRICES OR BAD ADVICE.

How does this effect the list, because if people would stop using BAD
repair places they would have to shut their doors eventually, or start
repairing other makes of cars, &quot;Like this place has done.&quot;

It makes me sick to see people who don't know enough about VW's get
shafted on shoddy work and worse yet drive a vehicle they thought was
repaired only to break down or CRASH into another vehicle.

As for David, He is a GREAT guy, I almost associated him with where he
works when I first met him, but realized he actually was not like them.

This is not meant to trash any one or any places character, just the
facts as I and others in our area see them.
