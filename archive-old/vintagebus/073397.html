Subject: Battery danger

Was written*******************************
   If you think this is phooey, extremely rare, or a
nearly non-exist phenomenon that only happens in labs
etc. YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. My  brother had a battery
blow up in his face when he was about 17 and was lucky

enough to run blind to the bathroom sink and flush the
hell out of his face/eyes and, lucky suffered no
permanent damage.

It is rare, it does happen, so do yourself a big favor
and always turn your face away, or better yet use the
hood of a normal car to shield your face when
connecting jumper cables or otherwise initially
messing with any unsealed lead acid battery terminals.

The way to protect yourself from igniting the fumes of
a battery while attaching cables is to always attach
the positive cable to the battery first and then
attach the negative cable to a ground source away from
the battery so if a spark does happen when you
complete the circuit, it will be away from the
battery. Simple and safe!
