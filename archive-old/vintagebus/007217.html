Subject: What does engine number tell me?

Supposedly my van has a beetle engine in it, according to the little rich
boys who sold it to me. Engine number is
211 101 102
which i found on the right side bottom of the crankcase after I took the
heads off. Now call me crazy but a bus is a type 2, hence the 211?
Is it possible to determine year of vehicle an engine came in with this
info? Thanks for any help.
