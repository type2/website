If you used your 28 you will need one of those SP to DP cab adaptors.  Same 
deal if you use a 30/31 or any other SP carb.  Some people enjoy the 34s- the 
DP carb that take no adaptor, but then again some people find them problematic

&gt;  my original is a 1600 single port, the new ones are dual port, so i 
believe 
&gt; i
&gt;  will need a new carb(the 28 pict won't fit the new manifold)
&gt;  
&gt;  My options:
&gt;  30/31 pict electric choke
&gt;  34-pict-3
&gt;  or something else?
&gt;  
&gt;  what do you guys recommend?
&gt;  Mileage/reliability is more important than acceleration.
&gt;  
&gt;  any reccommendations, suggestions?
