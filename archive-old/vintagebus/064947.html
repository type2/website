Subject: Re: [VB] NEATO and other clubs in general.....(long)

 At one point I too was a little disgruntled with one
of my clubs newsletter, or lack of one! But I have to
say that they addressed the problem and it has been on
time every month for at least the last year and it is
getting better every month. 
 It's also important that members submit articles
and/or suggest items they would like to see to keep
the newsletters fresh. Not sending out a newsletter
for a few months is not acceptable and lucky for me
the clubs I belong too (SVII's , Split Bus Club) send
'em out every month, sometimes they are in color to
boot!
