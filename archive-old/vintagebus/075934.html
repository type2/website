&gt; With gas heat, I won't use the stock heating system 

Hi John,
Keep the stock heating system.  Doing without will require using lots more 
gas and thusly worse MPG.  You will use the stock heating system plently in cool 
weather and even in cold weather it will help from using the gas heater 
constantly or at least not on high all the time.
