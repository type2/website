For those of you attending.

Any way to identify each other?

I was thinking we could all were billboards saying &quot;list nerds&quot;

or something even more subtle like Name Badges...

No, really.  I wish there were a way to spot someone you wish to exchange
greetings, but not be so overtly blatant that we are part of the &quot;internet
elite&quot;.

Any opiniong?  flowers, buttons, tatoos????

I plan to be there, but not in my bus.  Going with some friend to get them
excited about VW's

_______

For those of you in the Northern California area and don't already know,
there is a VW show in Vallejo this Sunday, May 2nd.  Hope to see some list
members there...
