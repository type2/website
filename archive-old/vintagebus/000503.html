Hi Dale,
Do you not mean that this is to the front right of the distributor?

&lt;&lt; with about an inch and a half exposed, and nothing I've tried will allow 
me to turn the bolt or, in most cases, to even grab hold of the bolt:  i've 
tried box wrenches, pliers, sockets and nothing even comes close to solving 
the problem. &gt;&gt;
If so reach over with a 13 mm socket and remove the nut that secures the 
clamp to the engine case.  Remove the distributor, and clamp together.  Then 
replace the clamp with the proper one that ends up with it's tightening 
fasteners to the left rear of the distributor.  Just make sure the 
distributor clamp touches the distributor in as much of it's interior curve 
as possible.  We recently helped a friend get a mystery motor running.  One 
of it's biggest problems was the (Probably aftermarket.)clamp only touched 
the distributor at three points of it's interior.  Allowing it to slip!
