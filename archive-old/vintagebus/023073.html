&gt;I have now found one of the Buses about which I speak.  It is a nice old 23
&gt;Window.  It appears to be all intact with the exception of the rear seats.
&gt;Hence, my first question - 1) How hard (and HIGH PRICED)  are these items to
&gt;locate?

They're not *too* hard to find, but expect to drop a few hundred tokens for
the whole set.  Batteries not included.

&gt;It has a new sunroof (cover).  However, it is missing a couple of bows.
&gt;Hence,  my second question 2)  How hard would this be to repair?

How in the heck did they replace the sunroo cover with it missing bows?
Does not computer.

&gt;This old bus is pretty much all there and rust free.  It runs and drives,
&gt;but needs brake work and a tune up.  Hence, my third question 3)  What is a
&gt;reasonable price for a 23 window Bus in this condition?

Your defintion of &quot;rust free&quot; may differ from mine.  Tell me where the rust
is, and how much.

&gt;Finally,  Can anyone lend any advice regarding questions I should ask about
&gt;the bus?

Get a many pix a you possibly can.  Have him write down the #'s off the
mcode tag behind the front passenger seat.

What condition are the floors?   Rockers?  Moulding? Glass?  Remaining seat
covers?  Collision damage?  Belly pans?

Isn't it fairly humid out there?  It may hide more rust than you realize.

&gt;I am going to request a video of the Bus so that I can  get a better idea of
&gt;its condition.

Good idea.  However, make sure he drags it out into the light - I've seen
some crappy pix/videos of cars.
