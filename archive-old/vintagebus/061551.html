Subject: engine miss at high rpm

A high rpm engine miss has rapidly developed in my 67
Westy, 1600 DP with dual carbs, Brazilian Webbers.  I
can accelerate up to around 45 or 50 as long as I open
the throttle up pretty good, but when I back off a
touch to maintain that speed and then give it a little
to hold it the engine starts running rough and doesn't
accelerate unless I floor it again.  I posted a
previous message about re-jetting these Brazilian
carbs cause it was running rich, noted by the black
deposites on the plugs and black exhaust tail pipe.  I
replaced the exhaust system and that problem cleared
up.  The plugs are now nice and tan/brown.  I think
the jetting thing is ok.  So, I went through the tune
up proceedure: valve clearance; 1-intake tight exhaust
.006 2- intake tight exhaust tight 3- intake loose
exhaust loose 4- intake loose exhaust loose   points
009; cleaned and regapped   timing; 7.5 btdc 
compression test; 1-95 2-95 3-95 4-115 (throttle
closed)  I will check the carbs this weekend,  but I
don't know what to check.  I took the air cleaners off
and ran it up the road and it still stumbles around
3000 rpm I am guessing. Oh yeah, and the end play is
way up there.  I can move it back and forth by pushing
and pulling on the pulley.  She's a little long in the
tooth :)  Anyone have any ideas about the engine miss?
 Thank you very much.  Also, how long do you think
this engine will stay together.  I just drive it
around the beach, 10-15 miles a day...  Thank you.
