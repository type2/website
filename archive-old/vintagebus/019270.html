&quot;&quot;&quot;I have a question about a Bosch 75amp alternator
for my bus. I am looking for the part number if anyone
has bought one for their bus and if you have was there
anything special to installing it.

I have also thought about putting a 75 amp alt in my
67 Camper to keep both my batteries charged. If anyone
has any insight on the 75 amp alt please post it to
the list. 

Thanks
