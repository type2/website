It had crossed my mind on more than one occasion that I could very well be
sitting here telling my tale of woe, of the BNNTA event that I had missed
for yet another year, of how my engine failed me in my time of need, etc.
Fortunately that was not the case.  I actually made it to BNNTA in a bus I
fixed up (with the help of many friends) on the longest trip I have taken
yet in a split window bus.  I have an accumulated 3,000 miles now in my
splitty of which the last approximately 700 miles have been on my dual
Weber'd 1776.  So for all of you who have followed my saga from the
beginning or are just looking for a good t2 story to read, here we go:

I posted my last message to the list sometime around Thursday evening.  I
had drilled out the jets on the 40IDF's and installed/gapped the chromoly
pushrods.  I wasn't done packing until about 1:00 a.m. and adrenalin kept me
up at least another hour.  I was up, packed, ready to go, and on the road at
6:50 Friday morning.  I decided to head south on 77 to Highway 36 east which
would take us the majority of the traveled miles to the BNNTA campsite.
Terry Wolfe had left Omaha on his maiden voyage of any great length in his
cream over red 65 Westy and was headed south on I-29 in Iowa which parallels
the Nebrasky/Iowa border.  A quick cell call earlier confirmed that we more
than likely would arrive at the pre-determined gas station within no more
than 30 minutes of each other.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Rob Laffoon had been taken by Terry the night
before to the Greyhound Bus depot.  Rob had left Omaha Thursday evening
enroute to Tulsa, OK to hopefully pick up a single cab that he had been
working on buying a couple weeks prior to the BNNTA event.  It had worked
out wonderfully that about the time the deal was sealed, the BNNTA event was
literally around the corner so Rob concocted the idea of picking up his 1966
SC and driving from Tulsa to BNNTA (424 miles!) Rob had tried to minimize
his carry-on weight on the greyhoud but still had a bag that was heavy and
laden with tools.  I think he mentioned that at each stop, he would quickly
dismount the greyhound and scurry to grab his bag before the attendants did
so they wouldn't know how much weight he had in his bag.  It was heavy but
necessary.  As planned, the owner of the SC picked up Rob about 5:30 Friday
morning and within 20 minutes of arriving at the guy's house, Rob was on his
way to BNNTA!

I beat Terry to the Conoco about 4 miles east of St. Joseph, MO and couple
of quick phone calls to Terry's cell resulted in me hearing nothing while
Terry heard himself talking.  I finally left voice mail and within 7 minutes
of my arrival at the station (9:55), I saw the little cream and red Westy
inching along the long flat stretch of highway!  Terry and I would have
arrived at the same time but due to the Conoco being a little farther down
than Terry had thought, he turned off to make sure I wasn't waiting at some
other exit.  After he got my v-mail, he boogied on down and there we were -
2 Nebraskies on their longest T2 trip yet!!!
As a little side note, on Highway 36 in KS, I spied a real nice maroon late
60's or early 70's Beetle for sale in a farmer's yard and then later saw a
beat up Maroon one for sale as well.  Close to St. Joseph I saw (not for
sale) and Baja'd Fastback - rather interesting!  Moving right along...

By this time I had noticed I was losing a lot of oil.  The 350+ trip took 4
quarts of oil and the engine was staturated top and bottom but mostly around
the rear.  I just kept pouring it in and figured I was going to make it come
hell or high water.  I followed Terry at his leisurely pace of 50 to 55,
keeping an eye on my lower revving engine's oil temps and making sure to
literally baby my engine during these first few hundred miles of break-in.
We stopped in some town along the way to grab food and camping supplies
because I told Terry that once we arrived at camp, we wouldn't want to
leave.  In agreement we ate at a McDonalds, loaded up on goodies for the
campout, and left, arriving at Monroe City, MO sometime about 3:00.

To say it was HOT out was an understatement.  The 102F heat pulled moisture
from your lips as you drove and your sweat glued you to your seat.  The good
part is that through all this heat, Terry's bus still just purred along and
my oil temps never exceeded 195F.  I was pulling a roof rack with a bike
laying in the top, tools, personals, and a complete 1600DP turnkey for the 3
of us just in case.  Not until we reached the campsite did my oil temps hit
200 as heat soak and idling around caught up with me.  We finally parked
near the entrance so Rob could find us.  I registered, met up with Bill
Bowman (great guy!), and within 45 minutes a little green SC rolled up.  IT
WAS ROB!  Yeah - he made it!!!  I was so happy for him.  The little SC got
him there but she was running too damn hot - so much so I was surprised it
made it there.   You could tell Rob was tired and rightly so.  He'd had more
of an adventure than any of us did and a lot more unknowns.  I set out to
find why I was loosing so much oil and I found that I had failed to put the
o-ring on the 009!  Terry suggested a hack with duct tape but I was
confident that by asking around, someone would have what I needed.  As it
turns out, 3 campsites down from us, a fella (sorry I can't remember your
name!) had a brand new dizzy o-ring - still in RMMW wrap!  He didn't want
anything for it - he just told me to help someone else out sometime.  I
slapped that o-ring in and I lost a LOT less oil on the return trip.  I also
failed to mention that while I was cruising the campsite the first time, I
spied Isaiah and we both knew each other right away from seeing each other
on out websites.  Later Friday evening, I saw a blond headed guy visiting
with Isaiah and while we were introducing outselves to each other, he said,
&quot;My name is Shawn...&quot; and about the same time, we kind of knew who each
other was.  It was neat later on that Shawn let me drive his 1960 deluxe
into town (11 miles) while I was looking out of my old windshields that now
live in his bus - old tint still intact! :-)

We started setting up camp - tents, goods, all the while trying to tolerate
the heat.  That first day/night was terrible - I didn't sleep worth a crap,
my sheets were soaked, and we just had to go find other t2ers who brought
fans in our efforts to cool down.  It was interesting sleeping though -
laying a foam pad on the asphalt and looking up at the stars - literally
sleeping right out in the open which was a very new experience to me.

I'm a bit foggy on the details but I want to take a minute to acknowledge
the listees who sought me out throughout this event.  It was kind of neat -
almost being like a minor celebrity with people coming up and saying, &quot;I've
read your posts for a long time and I really enjoy them.  It's really nice
to put a face with the name.&quot;  I hoped that people would realize that I'm
just an average Joe who likes to work on and write about his ACVWs.  I think
and would like to think that they came away with the impression that I'm
just a plain (or plain crazy) ordinary VW nut who is friendly and nice to
visit with.  I hope I don't leave anyone out of this list but I met John
Flowers, Shawn and Sarah Hunt, Isaiah, Dave Easterwood, Jamie Rivers and his
sidekick Jeff, Rob and Karen Dahlgren (sp?), Bill Bowman, Steve Lashley,
John Cremer, Woody and company, and assorted members of the wild and wacky
DBG and Missouri Micros clubs.  Please forgive me if I left anyone out.  I
would liked to have met Jim &quot;Zunfolge 1-4-3-2&quot; Andersen but I had run into
town for supplies and when I returned, he had left a note on my bus.  Justin
Laffoon (Rob's son) was there and showed Jim my engine and my bus so I was
glad of that.  Sorry I missed you Jim!!!

As we bedded down Saturday night, Rob and Justin slept in the back of SC.  I
can tell Rob enjoys the functionality of his SC - the treasurechest and rear
bed was always carrying something.  Rob could outhaul me anyday!  :-)
Throughout the night buses continued to arrive.  Our neighbors Jerry and Pat
were here from Nashville in their avacado-green baywindows and their little
dog Susie.  All 3 of them were nice and were gracious enough to let us sit
in front of their fan to help cool off.  I decided that since the caravan to
Hannibal, MO was at 11:00, we had better set out to find why Rob's SC was
not running cool.  I really didn't want Rob ruining his engine on the
cruise.  My worries about my oil leak kept me from driving on the cruise so
I thought I could at least give Rob peace of mind.  First order of business
that we tackled with Rob's SC was the fuel filter location.  I can't
remember where it was before but we ended up cutting the aluminum fuel line
to shorten it so that we could relocate the filter. There were 2 holes in
the rear tin that needed plugging so duct tape took care of that.  Jamie
River's friend Jeff let us borrow a T4 degree ring and with a little
ingenuity, I had the 30 degrees of advance measured from my Berg pulley and
transferred over to Rob's stock pulley.  So the timing and dwell were set.
There was no more cussing and stomping of ths gas pedal required to get her
started.  I also replaced the belt as the old one was cracked.  A quick
drive to the Marina and back resulted in an engine that STILL ran hot.  I
was perplexed until Terry Wolfe asked about the air flaps.  Great idea!  I
took off the bottom tin (with 10 minutes left until the cruise!) and found a
failed thermostat.  The failure in itself was not the cause of the problem
as the bellows were complete extended however, POOR and WRONG adjustment
never allowed the vanes to open fully!  I just shoved the bracket up as far
as it would go and tightened it down and quickly put the tin on as the first
caravanners were rolling by!  It was confrimed by the time we reached the
Mark Twain Cave visitor's center that the heat was now being removed from
the engine and yes, it was definitely running cooler!  The Berg temp
dipstick which I had also installed that morning confirmed that indeed, the
oil temps were running 180 to 190.  Whew!

The caravan was very scenic as we rolled around on little asphalt roads
through the country side.  We actually got slowed way down by a pickup
towing some farm equipment so we all got a little taste of what the average
motorist must feel like when they get behind us!  I was able to ride with
Terry on the caravan and his little bus just runs like a top - a very nice
ride indeed!

The Mark Twain Cave tour was very awesome!  Our tour guide Nathan really
spiced up his commentary on the caves and I slipped him a nice tip when he
was done because I really appreciated his enlightened conversation.  We saw
all kinds of neat tunnels, caverns, deep water pits, small stalagmites (sp?)
and bats!  They would fly over our heads and one just did barely get in my
hair during one point where I was running through the tunnels.  FUN!  Rob
and I tortured people with a shop rag and the whole group simply had a big
laugh.  When those amongst us who were scared of the bats ducked for cover
at the site of one, we would flap the rag across the back of their necks.
They should really sell rubber wings on a stick to torture people with -
that would make the tour a lot more fun.  Anyway, Rob elicited a scream out
of one of the ladies and at one point when we were in a narrowed part of the
cave, a bat repeatedly flew above me and Rob and Karen Dahlgren.  Rob ducked
down and froze stiff when my shop rag raced across the back of his neck
(much to the amusement of Karen and the rest of us!)  Rob and Karen are very
good natured people and Rob took it in good stride.  I believe he and his
wife are fro Bartlesville, OK and I look forward to slipping down there in
the near future and visiting them.  I enjoyed their company.
