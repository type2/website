Steve:
I don't get it about the transaxle. It's a 71, right? Small nut and large nut
are terms for bug (001) type trans as used in pre- 68 type 2's. Your bus
doesn't have swing axles and reduction boxes does it?
63-6400 rpm at 60 mph sounds WAY too fast. (geared too low)Top speed listed for
a 1971 is 68 mph and engine hp is 60 _at_ 4400 rpm. I'd guess maybe 68mph comes at
4500 rpm or so. . I wonder if ALL your guages are just reading high?
All other things considered, I really wonder if it IS getting that hot. Maybe
you could independently check the oil temp to make sure you are on the right
track.
Lower compression will NEVER make it run hot, so that's not the problem.

&gt; Anyway, we made it home but my engine overheated the whole way
&gt; practically. And everything seems to be right, I cant figure it out.
&gt;
&gt; * 1641 DP with 6.8 or 6.9:1 compression
&gt; * no exhaust leaks
&gt; * Jetting right (140 mains, 55 idles, dual weber ICT, slightly black
&gt;         plugs no vacuum leaks)
&gt; * Kool tins, all tin Stock, sealed up &amp; in proper place
&gt; * doghouse shroud, hoover bit, brand new brazillian cooler
&gt; * thermostat and flaps functioning properly (disconected just in case, no
&gt;         help there)
&gt; * Turning 63-6400 RPM at 60
&gt; * oil pressure 10-14 at ilde 42 at speed
&gt; * all engine comp seals in place (even around the wires!)
&gt; * tried both with tubes from shroud to heaterboxes, and with tubes blocked
&gt; off for more air to the heads. No difference.
&gt;
&gt; temps ranged from 220-230 or so in cooler weather to 260 in the
&gt; desert.  By driving 55 or so we could usually keep it under 240, unless it
&gt; was over 90 out then it was 250 all the way, spiking to 260 uphill at
&gt; times. I would say the gague lies, but we had major vapor lock problems
&gt; and putting spit or water on the block it boiled instantly, so it was too
&gt; hot.
