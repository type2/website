The funny thing is, when was the last time you saw a bus that was sold to 
Japan, ever again? Remember the 53 or 54 deluxe that was blue and white and 
it was in Hot VWs years ago, the title of the article was sayanora. And I 
don't remember ever hearing about a sweet bus that someone picked up in Japan 
at there last vintage meet.
