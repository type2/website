Finally got the engine back into the bus today.  Funny thing, since I had to
move the oil filter back I needed slightly longer hoses.  The hydraulics shop
was almost out of the stuff I needed so I could only get one.  Luckily the
longer of the two I started with was _just_ long enough.  Not stretched, but
no slack either.  Good luck for once!

Synthetic oil is interesting stuff.  Just looking at it, and pouring it, you
can tell it's not quite like dino oil.  Although it's rated thicker (20w50) 
than the stuff I had been using (10w40) it doesn't pour as thick.  Running it
in the engine, the valve train was quieter (probably just due to being thicker)
but it stayed quiet even after the engine was good and hot.  I drove a few 
miles on the highway and in town and checked for leaks.  Since I fixed the
other leaks, the only one was the 1&amp;2 valve cover as I thought.  Synthetic does
seem to leak easier as it was dripping off the heat exchanger, and the dino oil
never leaked that bad.

The shifting problems I was having are finally cured.  The problem was a bent
clutch disc caused by an incompetent engine installer (now who could that be
:-)).  I think the reason is that it was out of alignment when I installed it
the first time, since the engine slid in ridiculously easily this time.  

While the engine was out I went crazy with the cooling tin and put on all of
it that I could find, stuff that's usually missing on engines like the left and
right deflector tin below and behind the cylinders, and the little covers for
the preheat riser tubes.  The doghouse oil cooler was missing the packing that
keeps air from flowing around it instead of through it.  I found that a length
of fuel hose fit the space perfectly!  I then (purists look away now) used RTV
around the edges of it.  Now all the air goes where it's supposed to.

I think that all the bugs have been worked out for now, except that I need to
rebuild the distributor.  Only thing I have to complain about is that the brand
new throw-out bearing I installed squeals like an old one!  Hopefully it will 
go away...
