List
well I finally replaced my gas gauge, and all the way home from Averries it
looked like it was steadily going down which is good sense he is about 120
miles away. Anyway I pulled into the neiborhood and up to a light, when I
looked down at the gauge it know said the tank was full. knowing the petrol
ferry probably hadn't visited me during my road trip, I assume the new gauge
must be bad. Anyway the light changes and I take my foot off the break and
the needle drops back down to where it should be. It seems that my breaks
are causing some type of power surge or something. Anyone have any ideas on
what is wrong and what I can do to fix it?
Also when I was down talking to Averries he said that it doesn't matter if I
use a 12 volt or a 6 volt gauge, that they work on resistance and not
voltage, that if you use a 6v in a 12 volt system the only thing that needs
to be replaced is the bulb. I still opted for the 12 volt unit but is this
true?
