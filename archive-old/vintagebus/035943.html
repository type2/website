Hi Steven,
6.40-15 bias ply bus tires used from 1955-63 (Except for the 1963 only one 
ton suspension.) has a dynamic rolling radius of 12.9&quot; or 25.8&quot; diameter.  
This is either larger or the same diameter than the P205/75R15s we have dealt 
with so far.  We have a original German Fulda and Continental 6.40-15 bias 
tires on rims that were used as spares only.  The Fulda measures at a 27&quot; 
diameter which is bigger than 205s and about the same size as 215/75R15s.  We 
need to get out the Continental for measuring sometime.  The later 7.00-14 
bias tires are supposed to have a rolling radius of 12.3&quot; or 24.6&quot; diameter.  
We have even run LT235/75R15 with a 29&quot; diameter on our 1963 SC where they 
just fit in the 1964-67 stock rear wheel wells.
