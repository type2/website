&gt;I am not a fan of the police, and it feels kinda
&gt;strange that I am thinking about working with them to
&gt;bust someone, but it pisses me off that someone is
&gt;trying prey on the VW community, and if it saves
&gt;anyone from getting screwed by this person, it's
&gt;probably worthwhile.
&gt;Thoughts??
I've been trying to write a response that is something more than a flame
since I read this. Let me try this:
  The &quot;not a fan comment&quot; indicates you need to spend some time thinking
about the trash they deal with every day. Might make you a bit more
understanding and willing to help them out and you might develop a more
mature attitude about the difficult job that puts them in life
threatening situations every day. Just my thoughts
