Subject: Today's fun (workin' on the bus - cont)

Hey y'all.
You may recall I had pulled the engine out of the Puddle Jumper to find 
a nasty oil leak and do the Mad Uncle Dave version of retorque.  I left 
the engine on my stand last night kind of laying on it's side, with a 
drip pan under it.  Today was a gorgeous day but I was scheduled to 
rabbit at the parts store so I kept busy there trying to ignore the fact 
that it was SO nice out and all the things I could get done on the bus 
if I wasn't working.

While at the store, I ordered a muffler because I realized I wouldn't 
get all the tin off to clean things properly, nor would I be able to do 
a proper retorque of the case.  At 4:04 I clocked out, jumped into the 
diesel Dasher, and smogged my way home.  In the door peeling off parts 
store uniform and into my grubbies I jumped.  Out the door I ran and out 
to the barn.  There she sat, just like I left her except for an 
important detail.  Small puddle of oil in the drip pan from the right 
front of the engine.  Things that make you go Hmmmm.  I pulled the 
exhaust and the tin and while I looked at the case nuts with the Gospel 
according to St. Muir in hand to review case torquing procedure.  I 
noticed the lower nut by #1 cylinder was gone.  Not loose, gone.  Nice 
clean dribble mark from the stud.  No wonder there was a leak of 
biblical proportions!

Steal another case nut from the old GusBus engine, put it on and started 
retorquing.  Really loose all the way around,  Fortunately all the nuts 
felt like the looseness was uniform all around on both big and small nuts.

So now all there is to do is pull flywheel to check that last nut and 
replace front seal and start the messy job of cleanup.  I'll soak the 
tin in the hot TSP bath for a couple days and start on the engine itself 
with various paintbrushes and kerosene.  One of Dave's Grand Unified 
Theories is that cases loosen up over time (hence the pull and retorque) 
and this starts leaking oil onto p[arts that really need to shed heat.  
the oil bakes on, holds dirt, and you get accelerated wear on vital 
parts that have this strange need to shed combustion related heat.

So the mystery of the oil cloud is solved (I think), and I'm relieved to 
find something that simple.  I do wonder though what damage may have 
occurred due to the loose case/missing nut.

Ahhhhh, I do love working on the beasties because they always present me 
with a new learning experience and at least  3 epiphanies with every job 
tackled.

Mad Uncle Dave
