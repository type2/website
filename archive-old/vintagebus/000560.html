Hi NQ,
Sure, if you weld the area thicker, mill the top of the weld flat, and then 
drill, tap.  To bad you did not cut the front shift rod with a hacksaw blade, 
after scribe marking it for twist.  Then using the hacksaw blade as a measure 
of how much material was removed, and the scribe marks to align the two ends 
you could have easily welded it back together.  Eric&amp;Barb
