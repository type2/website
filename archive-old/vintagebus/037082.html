Ok, heres a good one, you got those Barndoor mirror arms correct? Well I have
seen 'em on 2, 55's, on the passenger side. One is in the Brekina calendar,
the one with all the panels, and the other is a Single cab from the Lone Star
State. I guess those can not be called BD style any longer. Damn late models!
