Hi list and Jason,	
&lt;#1 When I'm driving and I
let off the gas peddle the bus pulls to the right, if I'm driving and
instead of letting off the gas peddle I push it into neutral it doesnt.&gt;

The experience that I've had in that problem is that it is not the tranny
mounts at all. I had the same problem in my deluxe and it seemed to be the
reduction box was worn out, either the bearings were going bad, or the outer
housing was worn past tolerances. I had the problem and put a new tranny in
and since there aren't new reduction boxes available I had to find the best
housing. It took a while but the ones now barely pull to the right when I let
off the gas pedal. The reason it pulls to the right (drive axle) when you let
off the gas pedal is because the motor and tranny are still under a load.
Putting it into nuetral takes the load of the motor off the tranny and
reduction boxes.
This is my understanding of what you're dealing with, it worked for me with
the new tranny, other people with more tranny experience might have different
ideas. Hope I'm on the right track.
Good luck
