covers the electrical terminal on the license plate light on my '63. Not the 
rectangular seal around the lense, but the boot that covers the wire on the 
back side.  Does anyone know if these are being reproduced, or better yet 
does anyone have one good used or NOS.   Are they the same for later years?  
What part number am I looking for?&gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
211 943 165 B  Rubber cap - License plate light (For USA only).
We have seen NOS of these sold at Sacramento years ago, and wish we had 
gotten some then.  If you find some please drop us a note!   Eric&amp;Barb
