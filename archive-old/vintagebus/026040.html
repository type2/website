Subject: [VB] windshield wiper motor noise
Message-ID: &lt;3817D75D.D02F4A2_at_escape_dot_ca&gt;

Wow -  did that head light switch repair go well.  For some reason there
was grease in that switch - really dirty - yuck.  Now  it's all cleaned
and soldered and working like new. (thanks to E&amp;B).

My current concern is the noise that comes from my windshield wiper
motor.  I'm sure that it is about to give up the ghost.  Is there
anything that I can do to prolong its life?  It is a 6 volt motor on a
12 volt bus.  I never run it continually - only intermittently - mostly
becuase the noise scares me.  But if there is something relatively
simple that I can do to cut down on the noise and prolong the life of
that wiper motor then I'd like to do it.

TIA
