&gt;so lo and behold I get the inner handle off the rear
&gt;door (the one without the outside handle) and the
&gt;threads for the screw to hold it in are stripped.
&gt;
&gt;Can you rethread these? Or should I get a new
&gt;mechanism?

If there's enough meat left you might be able to drill it out and tap
it to the next bigger size.  Or maybe line the stripped hole with
super-duper epoxy and then re-tap that.  Maybe a Helicoil even...they
come in some fairly small sizes.

&gt;Details: '67 deluxe 21 window.
&gt;
&gt;PS: Anyone got one they can part with for an honest price
&gt;or trade for equal value in Vintage Evel Knievel toys?

I think it would take a whole lot of EK toys to trade for a
21 window deluxe... :)
