i spent close to ten hours on the road to make
solvang. i enjoyed the weekend with a great group of
people(SV2s), we visited a very beautiful area, we
cooked brats and met volks folks, scored some stuff at
the swap, ate some brats, visited with friends from
VTO, shared in the excitement when &quot;colorado&quot;rob won
class with his '67 ambulance, saw many highroofs, ate
too much at the potluck, spent a few hours around the
camp fire tellin' lies and reminiscing, had the
opportunity to spend some time with mark adair, won
some stuff at the raffle sat night, and saw some
ggvvws parked on the grass. how can that weekend
suck?! it was all good! an observation:
bus shows seem to be more interactive, and less show
and shine. perhaps because the bus is less about show
and shine, and more about interaction. drive em, camp
em, load em, work em. see ya at OCTO (servin' brats)
jay
