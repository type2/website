Mine does not have a release knob (just walked out to the garage and
checked).  I wonder if it has something to do with the build/delivery.
Although this bus came with seatbelts and US-spec glass, it was delivered to
Scotland as part of the old &quot;tourist delivery program&quot;.  The original owner
took delivery in Glasgow and drove it around for a month before it was
shipped back to his home in Baltimore (Ive got all the documentation to
include original sales order).

FWIW, he paid $2000 for it in '67.  &lt;&lt;grin&gt;&gt;

&gt; Check the mechanism on the 1/3 tilt forward part of
&gt; the seat. In mid-67 they put a release button on the
&gt; side of the 1/3 section (a round knob you slide upward
&gt; to release the seatback so it can tilt forward.)
&gt;
&gt; Mine doesn't have this knob, mine's a '67, mine has
&gt; the holes in the leg bottoms.
&gt;
&gt; So, maybe release knob = no holes = late '67?
&gt;
