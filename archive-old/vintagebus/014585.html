Subject: Re: How do you remove the ebrake cable?

this question was posted re a 66 bus, which is it has the big nut rear 
axles...

get the brake shoes off the backing plate and out of the way.   Grab the end 
of the cable on the spring and pull.  See the little itty bitty clip that 
goes between the spring and backing plate?   push that out of the way with a 
screwdriver.   Let go the brake cable, and you should be able to push it 
through the backing plate.   Put the little clip in the hub cap with the lug 
nuts, and put it somewhere you won't kick it over.   Yes this is the real 
purpose of having hubcaps.


if you wan't to get the cable off the bus, you have to undo the 2 10mm nuts 
off the cable at the ebrake lever (in cab, we are still talking 66 here) and 
then pull cables out backwards.    I don't replace them unless they are bad, 
but I carry a spare behind the front seat.  spare clutch and accelerator 
cables too.  Tucked into the back of the seat, you know what I mean?
