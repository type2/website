Hi Clara,
No confusion here!  Well not much anyway.  ;-)  We were just trying to show 
that the upper axles that had the spring loaded ball bearing in the side of 
the shovel handle endss were made way past the split case tranny era.  These 
can be used on up thru 1967 buses and in our experience with carefull 
measuring these upper axles can be mixed and matched with replacement crown 
gears and fulcrum plates.   Eric&amp;Barb
