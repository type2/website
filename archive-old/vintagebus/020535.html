Had the same problem with the '63EZ camper.
Careful minor die-grinding or dremel clearancing of
the area works great. Use caution not to take too
much! Inspect, mark the material to be removed and
&lt;carefully&gt; go for it.

**Remember to cover the intake hole or otherwise
prevent the grinding dust/shards from entering the
intake!** 

Clean and inspect the entire area prior to reassembly.
Over kill of cleanliness is a good thing in this case.

Forget the spacers in this instance. The off-set
spacer is primarily for using a 30PICT or 30-31 on a
larger throated intake and offsetting for the
alternator. If there is a straight spacer I have never
used one.

Jon's suggestion of substituting for OG linkage is
ideal if possible. Dremel did the deed for me.
