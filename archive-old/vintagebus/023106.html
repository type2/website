They've been by the Bridge, they've been by the Arch, they've been nowhere
near the Arch, they've been by Balloons, they've been under the Moon, but
eventually they all wind up... IN THE SHOP!

Volks Authority and the Silicon Valley Chapter of Strictly Vintage 2s
presents Buses in the Shop I!  Join us for a day of storewide discounts on
all your Bus needs, free BBQ and drink, a selection of cool and rare Buses,
and a great time for all!  Don't drive a show bus?  No problem!  We want to
pack Stockton Ave with Buses...so drive down whatever you own and park
amongst fellow Transporter lovers!

The whole shebang gets underway Sunday August 27th from 10am - 4pm!  Volks
Authority is located at 1098 Stockton Ave in San Jose, off Newhall and
Coleman Ave...near Hwy 880 and the San Jose Int'l Airport!  Call Volks
Authority for more info at (408) 287-8169 or the SV2s local rep, Taylor
Nelson, at (408) 287-8169.

See you all there!!
