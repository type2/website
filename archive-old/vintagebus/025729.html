&gt; I have a question that I keep hearing mixed messages about!
&gt; Here is goes,
&gt; I am 15 years old. I DO have a job, but I don't get a lot of money. About $50 bucks a week.
&gt; I have a 1967 Volkswagen Kombi. The body is straight, but it needs a few things.
&gt; ALL the rubber, ALL the doorpanels, the headliner, the carpet and seat appulstry. As you probably know, $50 bucks a week will not suffice.
&gt; So almost everybody had been telling me &quot;don't buy from JC Whitney, only buy quality stuff.&quot; I have also heard that &quot;JC Whitney is great, always ontime!&quot;
&gt; But most people want me to buy from the really expensive people, they say it is better quality. Now I want to have a nice car! Is there a healthy meet you in the middle for this situation? What about bus depot? They have good prices.
&gt; Anyway, please respond and give me your thoughts.

Gabe,

I am on the side of &quot;dont buy JC whitney&quot;. Your money is hard earned and
you will be wasting  it on JC whiteny stuff.

I would suggest West Coast Metric. They are of reasonable quality, not
the best, but decent, and reasonable price.

Figure out what you need immediately, what you need down the line, and
what you can do without alltogether until you have a bunch of extra
money.

Post your needs (specific stuff) to the list. I am a WCM distributor,
and sometimes come upon spare stuff I can let go to a good cause for
cheap. I know that there are others on the list that sometimes have
extra stuff they can sell cheap to someone trying to save a bus.

Do it a bit at a time. Triage is the name of the game. Figure out the
most immediate needs and how much cash you have, and work on those. 

A little at a time adds up over the long haul.
Good luck, and do respond with specific needs. I'll be suprised if the
list cant beat JCW in price, quality, and helpfulness....
