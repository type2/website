Pretty Cool Matt!
            Very interesting! I  am not sure if it is a Westfalia.It looks
more like a E-Z camper ( I say that because of the cabinet in the
foreground),or a mix and match home set up.Maybe somebody modified a
Westy.But!! Some brighter pics of the interior would help!!! Do the cushions
unattach and how?? Is there a closet just inside the cargo doors?What kind
of wood would you say it is?Oak? Pine?Birch!!?? What do the back cabinets
look like?Is there original material under the Hawaiian stuff? No curtain
rods? Any propane appliances? Does it smell German in there?haha.It's cool
whatever it is.
