Subject: Re: [VB] Rebuilt Steering Box Sources? (Prices?)

&gt; When my steering box failed, it was the peg (and probably the worm) that
&gt; failed.  These are rather precise machined parts which are then
&gt; case-hardened (?) and who knows what else.  My feeling is that it is these
&gt; parts that make the new boxes pricey.

But it is my understanding that those parts are not replaced. Or rebuilt.
They actually sandblast the old ones! Yup, taking a little more metal away
will make them brand new.....

The bearings (if needed in their opinion) and seal are all they do. The
rebuild will only be as good as the core box it is done to. Funny though, I
had a nice tight box at OCTO that I was only asking $30 for. No one wanted
it except a guy who only wanted to pay $25. He actually told me that he
needed it because he had lowered his bus and he tore the bottom plate off of
his because it was too low. Came back several times, too. Wouldn't cough the
extra $5 though. So I have it and he doesn't. Prolly would have let him have
it if it hadn't been for the lowering thing. Can't see why I should pay for
his _______.
