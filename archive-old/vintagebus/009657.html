Greetings to all,
The day before yesterday I beat about a million other punters to a 16 year
shedded straight 59 bus. I am rapt! The last time I owned a bus was about
1969 and I have sorely missed them. Then - came home, downloaded the wiring
diag. from Thom, stared at it all night and then joined this list.
This was thursday night. well friday I GOT MAIL!
I am in Australia and as far as I know I am the only person I know here who
loves the Dead.I didnt know about Phils liver though.
     He will get by. Hahahaha.
So today was good also. Thanx people, I will read you again tomorrow
Barry Wright.
