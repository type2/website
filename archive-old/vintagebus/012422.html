I bought some pieces from them a few years ago (rockers, hinge carrier,
battery tray) and the quality wasn't that great.  I didn't know anyone was
repoping rain gutters.

Das Bulli Haus was selling better stuff, but they appear to have been
abducted by UFO's (and trust me, HMO's do not cover anal probes) so I
guess Ronnie has stepped up to the plate to fill in the void.
