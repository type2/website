Subject: front spindles - stiff front end problem close to solved

Hi everyone,
Not sure if anyone else remembers, but before x-mas I asked the list for help 
regarding front end problems and the ride in my 15-window being super stiff.

I decided to pick up a drum to drum beam out of a 62 single cab. I 
immediately tore down the beam into it pieces so I could see how it all went 
together. I find out that the new to me beam is missing its small torsion 
leaves and had been lowered. Next I ordered all new seals and torsion leaves 
from Bus Boys. They shipped the parts out right away which was nice to get 
the stuff fast.

Today I had a chance to start stripping my front end down and replace all the 
old parts with the new parts. Everything came apart really nicely even though 
it was covered in almost 40 years of road grime and I couldn't see half the 
bolts or zerk fittings.

After cleaning the passenger side and getting the spindle and backing plate 
on I try and fit the drum. No go.....doesn't friggen' fit. Ok I check my 
parts manual to see if the spindle was the same. Parts manual says so. Check 
the 1963 factory workshop manual, looks the same except there's a difference 
between the 1200 and 1500 transporter. Not sure how that's gonna make a diff 
in my bus. Maybe it's the 63 1year only spindle deal.

So I figure I oughta check my old spindles that came off the bus to see if 
they can be salvaged. All the needle bearings happen to be frozen on both 
sides. Link pins came right out and looked good. King pins were nice and 
tight. Grease looked terrible in the needle bearing and had dried up or gone 
bad. So, now I'm soaking the bearing in lacquer thinner to see how they'll 
clean up. Looking good after 20 minutes of soaking.

The next problem and this is where it gets tricky. I'm cleaning out all the 
grease fittings and checking the hols to make sure they get grease. In the 
upper grease hole on the spindle the needle bearing bushing is not lined up 
with the hole for the grease fitting.
Other than sending the spindle out is there an easy way to get the bushing 
out of the spindle or can I drill a hole in the bushing to allow grease 
access to the needle bearing.

Anyways, enough rambling. If anyone has any good suggestions on how to fix 
this problem please let me know. I'm looking for a good and fast way to fix 
the problem.

Thanks and hope everyone has a good weekend.
