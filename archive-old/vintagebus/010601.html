Subject: Re: [vintagebus] small vs. big

My 61 has the early 64 gearing-  a 4.37 r&amp;p, with .82 4th, big nut RGBoxes, 
and 15&quot; rims with 205/75/15s on the back (currently have bug rims on the 
front as I removed the 15&quot; bus rims for powdercoating, the bug tires make the 
speedo say I am going faster).   With a 1600 sp that I have got used in my 65 
westy about 4 years ago and has been my daily driver motor since (though I 
did turn it SP from DP two years ago)   it can haul stuff, cruise 60 all day 
and stay happy, and even pull hills well.    I am sold.    

divide 75 by 1.26 you get 59.52

divide 75 by 1.39 you get 53.95

meaning at the same rpms you would go 75 in a bug/ straight axled VW,
with big nuts you go 59.5 mph
with little nuts you go 53.95 mph,

meaning the little nuts have more torque, less highway speed, see what I mean?

you could build a tranny with 4.37, bug .89 4th, small nuts, and 14&quot; rims 
with shorter tires for heavy duty mega torquey round town delivery vehicle.   
  The low gearing is how a 40hp motor can push the buses around (or a 36hp)   

remember the M 215 1 ton package included  1.26 RGearing, heavier brakes, AND 
the larger 1500 motor rather than the 40hp.

maybe I should put the little nuts on my 65, as it has that stupid 3.88 r&amp;p 
that is too high fro a 1600.   still haven't buildt the 1679 yet.

&gt;  do that now.....)

&gt;  &gt; if you put the little nut boxes on your trannys, you would be winding 
and 
&gt;  &gt; screaming the motor out at 60.   The truck I had with the 4.37/.82/1,39s
&gt;  was 
&gt;  &gt; like that.  I limited the top speed at 52.  FIFTY TWO miles per hours.   
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; you will, however, be able to pull mass heavy loads up hills without 
&gt;  &gt; downshifting.   with a 40hp motor
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; what are your driving aims?
