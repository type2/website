WOW! I was suprised to see that you too have the 'NJ RUST PROBLEM',
where all exposed metal goes DIRECTLY to rust.
This should be a lesson to all of us... You cannot park on the wrong end
of a runway!
Nice one! :^D

&gt;Well it had to happen.  I was paged to the front checkout at work and
&gt;someone had backed into my baby blue 68 bus.  I was devastated but at
the
&gt;same time, I was thrilled that it was only a minor hit.  I'm pretty
sure
&gt;that I'll be able to fix it with some body hammers and dollies as well
as a
&gt;little sanding and painting.    The guy was _VERY_ apologetic and was
more
&gt;than willing to snap this picture of the bus (with me checking things
out
&gt;(for insurance purposes.))

&gt;I was able to drive her home after some considerable coaxing but it
sure
&gt;handled differently - something must have gone out of alignment
someplace
&gt;but I'm sure it's nothing I can't fix.  We all must roll with the
punches
&gt;and sometimes even laughter.
