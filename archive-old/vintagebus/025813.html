It sounds like there's still some air in the MC. You can bleed the MC by
cracking open the brake line at the top of the MC while you pull the
brake pedal down with your hand. If there's air in the MC you'll see and
hear it foaming out around the nut on the end of the brake line. Tighten
the nut before you let the pedal go back up. If you find air, repeat
until you don't.
 
&gt; Oh yeah, the second wierd thing is that
&gt; after I drive Idalou for a while, the Brakes even out and the problems
&gt; are gone.

Maybe bleeding the MC will help that, but it sounds like a leaky wheel
cylinder.
