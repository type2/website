My '60 DC is valiantly transporting me to work and back every day, without a
hiccup, I might add...

The '66 (Clara) is patiently waiting for the transaxle/engine transplant to
come before our first big trip in a long time...to Jerome!  And in the
meantime, she takes us to see fireworks, movies, rescue bats, etc.....

The newly-aquired '58 is hoping that the '67 gets taken away (to new owner
after he helps me change transaxles) so it can have the garage before the
winter!  And speaking of lowering and hippies...&quot;I agree; it's a waste of
bandwidth that could be better spent dogpiling
on the hippies or lowered buses :)&quot;  has anyone noticed that this '58 is
lowered, and covered with Greatful Dead stickers?  (I like the lowering job,
anyway...it took a while for me to notice, so it's not &quot;slammed&quot; , and it
rides nice!)

Our buses are present and accounted for!

Later on,
