&lt;&lt; 2) Given my long drive home, I figured it would be a GOOD investment to go
 ahead and purchase new rear tires, as large as I can fit.  Want to get the
 top speed I can with the stock tranny and redux gears for the long ride.
 I've studied the archives, but would appreciate some assistance. What is the
 largest tire I can get that will not rub a stock '63 crew with two
 passengers, limited gear, and possibly an extra tranny (as cargo).  This msg
 http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/sm.asp?ID=78001&amp;ml=5 suggests that I can
 expect 47MPH in 4th _at_ 3000 RPM.  It also hints at 29&quot; tires, gaining about 6
 MPH, but doesn't talk about how well they fit. &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
We have and are using on our stock geared 1963 single cab truck a Trans Trak
Radial AT,  LT235/75R15.  This will fit on stock rims and in post-1962 rear
wheel wells just fine.  The only slight hang up is when you install the tires
on your bus they will rub slightly on the suspension on the inside when the
bus is in the air on the jack.  Once you lower the wieght of the bus on them
they never rub while driving.  You can slightly grind a very small spot on the
suspension to get these tire to stop rubbing when the bus is on the jack so
you can adjust the rear brakes.  With 25&quot; tires on the front you will be able
to get 53.6MPH with these 29&quot; tire on the rear.  Make sure you take a tach and
see where your revs are in each of the forward gears just in case the tranny
was badly rebuilt.  Like our 1960 panel that with the tranny we got with it,
that hit 3,000RPM in fourth gear at 35 MPH.  We literally could not get it
over 45 MPH on the flats.  No wonder the dual port engine that we got with the
panel bus had large holes in the top of the engine case.    Eric &amp; Barb
