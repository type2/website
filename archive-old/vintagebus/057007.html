Subject: Fw: Please Post.  Letter to the VW air cooled hobby from the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club

Recently there have been a rash of e-mail pertaining to the MVVC, it's relationship to VWoA and the MVVC May show. I would appreciate if you would take a moment to read the following. If you have any questions I can be reached at ed_at_mvvc_dot_net

What the MVVC is,

A group of 300+ members, primarily in Michigan. We started as a group  interested in air cooled VW's. As a chapter of the VVWCA we went by the guidelines of any VW car 25 years or older being eligible to join. That focus was fine tuned in 2001. After two surveys and a vote of the membership we have changed the by-laws of the club. While ownership of an air cooled VW  is not a requirement to membership, they are the only cars in the club. No water cooled VW's. Or to put it another way, the theme of this years MVVC show is &quot;Air Is Cool&quot;. We are also a social club. The May show is our main event, but we have many other events planned around the state of Michigan. For more information on our events and our survey on the change to air cooled please go to www.mvvc_dot_net
The May show is our money maker for the year. It funds the show for the next year. It also allows us to donate every year to a wide variety of local and national charity's and has enabled us to offer no interest temporary loans to other VW clubs (you know who you are!), struggling or just getting off the ground. Our May show draws primarily from the mid west, but we have cars come each year from as far as Maine to California as well as Canada. In 1995 the Gene Berg Memorial cruse was at our show. In 1999 the DKF club joined us on their way to Bad Camberg. This year the DKF club will be attending, and having their first ever national meeting at our show.

[maybe your charity this year should be the legal defense fund for all of the entities being sued
by VWOA.  To take ACVW peoples' money and do anything else with it just seems wrong.]

What the MVVC is not,

In any way, shape or form affiliated with VWoA or VWAG. We are an independent organization founded in 1986 for the enjoyment of air cooled Volkswagens. As we are in Michigan, and the majority of members in the Metro Detroit area we have over the years had out May show at VWoA in Auburn Hills. Our Contract for the show is with the Landlord that owns the building VW rents.We receive no monetary support of any kind for having our show there. And in the past it was a great place to have it. With the building open to view the VW museum it was a little something extra we could offer to our show goers. And in the past we were happy to be there. VW was, to a degree a friend to the hobbyist, and we were happy to have them show their new cars, again something our show goers appreciated.
 
[You still seem to be unaware that you're being leveraged to sell water pumpers, while at the same time
your parts channels and web sites are being squeezed.]

 We are well aware of the headaches that the hobby is currently facing, thanks to the _at_#&amp;%  mentality at VW. Remember the 300+ members, well we have several that are small business owners (service&amp; parts for VW&quot;s) and have felt the wrath of the VWoA legal storm troopers, we do not have to read about the VW induced headaches, some of our friends and members are living it!. We have agonized as to the location of this years show. And like many others we are furious that VW is being so underhanded in their dealings with air cooled VW fans and business people. We recognize and agree with VW&quot;s right to protect its trademarks, but to go about it in such a heavy handed manner, and with out any concrete guidelines for the hobby and its related businesses is unbelievably stupid, amazingly shortsighted and asinine.

[Yet you still provide tacit support for them.  Appearances are everything, and your putting on this show
on their turf is visible support, irrespective of what you *think* about them.  VWOA can now use this show,
ie news stories, pictures, etc as marketing material.  Making you a very effective *tool*]
 
[and if you removed the club's contribution, making it just their little 'museum' and a lineup of 
water-pumpers - what do they have then?  NOTHING!  It may as well be Cal Worthington riding an elephant.
Who would show?  NOBODY!  You have no clue of the opportunity you're sitting on!]

The MVVC show is at VWoA again this year. As this is our &quot;main event&quot; we cannot just walk away from this venue, this year any ways, and for several reasons. We have signed contracts with the near by host hotel (Marriott), landlord for the VWoA property, event permits with the city of Auburn Hills, insurance coverage for this specific day and location and others. Many of these were signed late last summer, and some have very stiff penalties ($$$) for cancellation

[translation: we really shouldn't participate in the pogrom, but Stalin's going to be there, we already
have reservations, and I bought a new dress...   We're driving off a cliff, but it would be a shame to
stop the car because we *just* filled it with gas...]

. Had we known then ,what we know now, the show would be at another location!.  We want ALL of our show goers to have a good time, to feel comfortable in their surroundings, and to enjoy all the events we have scheduled for the weekend. If we were to change the venue now, it would financially ruin the club. No more events, yearly donations to charity, no more loans to other VW clubs. We have been working on several other locations for the 2003 MVVC show. If VW continues to abuse the very people that helped them along, in good times and bad, then the MVVC in 2003 will be somewhere else.

[That's no excuse: the VWOA campaign has been going on for what, 3 years?  You just now found out?  The *EXACT* 
same issues were raised *LAST YEAR*. ]

What you can do,

Come to the show, in your AIR COOLED VW&quot;S!!!. Yes, VOA people will be there, let them see what the air cooled hobby is all about, the number of people, the enthusiasm for the hobby. Talk to these people, let then know how VWoA and VWAG is hurting themselves, their sales and their position with the VW hobby. This show is for the air cooled enthusiast, don't let its location keep you from enjoying one of the best shows in the Midwest, as well as the country.

[translation: ignore the man behind the curtain.  Your free expressions of love and joy will
make the grinch's heart grow 3 sizes that day!  NOT!! Let me turn on the clue generator for a minute: VWOA
isn't looking *your* direction; they've seen your cars before and frankly scarlett, they couldn't
give a damn. They're fishing for new water pumper customers, and YOU ARE THE BAIT!]

But if,

The location is too much to handle, you cannot bring yourself to set foot at VOA, we understand.We are, at this point not too wild about it either, but we are not going to let VW's current mentality destroy our show or our club. We do however ask that you not direct your anger at us, we are not the bad guys here. We are enthusiasts, just like you,and we are, quite frankly, just as PISSED OFF at VWoA as you are.

[but not pissed enough that we can't suckle just a bit more...]
 
 We have seen recent e-mail's that suggest you should &quot;blow off the MVVC show and come to ours&quot;, that we are &quot;tools of VOA&quot;, and are being &quot;prostituted by VW&quot;, pimps, unwitting dupes. In other words, almost as moronic as the current reasoning from VW!. I will say it again, WE ARE NOT THE BAD GUYS!, DO NOT LET YOUR ANGER DESTROY THIS HOBBY!, or promote bad feelings within the hobby. We are all in it together, lets keep it together.

[but let's still use the bad guy's clubhouse as a meeting place...]

[sort of a modified Nuremburg defense.  In other words, lets bend over *together*  
Hellooo!!!!!  You're helping them put the nails in your own freakin' coffin!
I still support a boycott of the show.  If nothing else, maybe it will get your heads out of the sand.  
Perhaps MVVC needs to suffer financially in order to see the light - that's the whole point of a boycott!
Promises of 'we'll change' don't mean anything ]

Thanks for your time

Ed Karmann, MVVC Secretary
