	Could this mean all original parts but restored to its original
luster like paint and rubber replacement ???

Just two cents nothing more nothing less!

Finally! Someone else has discovered this nightmare
too! Restored is NOT original just as NOS is not REPO!
I have seen that term mis-used a million times, even
to the point where an award was given to a very nice
bus that won best original bus but was actually
restored. 
Perhaps the problem is that too many people left
school before they were ready!

&gt; Am I the one that's confused? On Everett's site
&gt; there's a 1964 crew cab for
&gt; sale from Georgia.
&gt; The owner states: &quot;It was restored about 8 years ago
&gt; and garage kept since.&quot;
&gt; Then in the same paragraph he writes &quot;It's all
&gt; original and about as nice as
&gt; they come.&quot;
&gt; As far as I know, &quot;restored&quot; and &quot;original&quot; are
&gt; contradictory terms.
&gt; Or has this changed since I left school?
