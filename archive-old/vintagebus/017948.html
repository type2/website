what a week...i actually found a vw shop.  I have always been so jealous of
those of you who live 
near vw shops...as great as ronnie is, it is often a pain to have to order
everything over the phone, 
especially when half the time i don't know exactly what the piece i want is
called, but i have the busted 
one in my hand.

up in boston where i usually live, there aren't any vw shops that i have
found. and i have been here in 
houston on and off for 2 years before i found this place....damn i am slow

today i got a new header...not too exciting, except i had no idea which one i
needed, but the guy at 
the shop seemed pretty nice...took a look at what i was looking for, and also
let me know who the 
best vw mechanic is in houston.

i also went to a local vw club meeting, and there was someone i met there
talking about how great the 
type2 list is.  and i was pretty proud to be a member(even if i am the idiot
of the group)
