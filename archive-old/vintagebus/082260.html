&gt; All,

&gt; A while back I wrote the customer service addresses of several major
&gt; tire companies, asking what they would recommend for &quot;modern&quot; replacement
&gt; tires for a Bus.  I knew what the list wisdom was and I wanted to compare
&gt; it to their responses.  I was also checking to see how well various
&gt; companies responded to inquiries.  The results are summarized here:
