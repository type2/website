Subject: Re: [T2] tranny oil: Rancho sez....

Thom writ:
&gt;The style of synchros used in early VW and 911 (901 &amp; 915)
transmissions do not work well with synthetic - it's *too* slippery.&lt;

I agree with this.

The absolute best fluid in my opinion is the Swepco 201 gear lube.  Most all 
Porsche parts places will have it in stock.  It is not cheap, but man o man 
is it like liquid sex to a tranny!
