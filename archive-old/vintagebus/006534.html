Subject: T2 drums for sale

Hey all - I've got a set of brake drums that came off from a 1967 bus.  They
look to have very little wear on the inside but I'm going to have them
turned today in preparation for selling them.  I'm starting to put some
stuff on ebay but I thought before I put a set of old brake drums for sale
there, I'd offer them to you guys.  Ronnie at type2parts_dot_com told me to have
my brake drums turned before I put them on my 67 and I wouldn't be
disappointed.  He was right - I can lock my brakes up if I want to.

I'll entertain any offers at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com and answer any questions
but after today, I'm gonna post them on ebay if I don't find a buyer.
