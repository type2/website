Subject: changing my nuts in one day
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0008210912430.70791-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

Hello all,

I was a bit worried about the condition of my transmission in my 61 bus,
original small nuts tranny...  i had a 67 tranny, probably low mileage
never apart sitting in my garage, and a free saturday afternoon.

Havign helped a friend do his tranny, i knew it wasnt that big of a deal
to swap so i went to it.

I had the old tranny out and the new one installed within 6 hours, had to
do the brakes sunday as the shoes i had were toast :(  Fortunately Advance
Auto Parts could get me the shoes the next day (sunday) for $20, i was
very impressed with that. One shoe was so worn out tht it had scored the
drum to teh point it was ruined.  Luckily i had 4 spare drums to pick from
and i installed the 2 best of those.

So at 4:00 yesterday i wrapped it up and took it for a test drive, some
things i noticed...

Now with the 67 bignut, the 3-4 shift is a bear! i think my 1600 DP with
extractor will be getting a bus muffler for more low end torque...

first gear is useable for more than just getting moving, the mall nut
first gear with a 1600 was almost useless, you had to shift almost
immediately, i found that annoying.

My starter now turns like crazy because i have both the 67 and 61 ground
strap in place. (67 goes from front tranny mount to transaxle case, 61
goes from rear tranny mount to starter bolt) I wouldnt doubt if half the
starter problems in old busses are from bad or missing ground straps...

A friend (brian) has had poor engine power problems since a tranny swap, i
was thinking he ought to check his ground straps for good connections as
the tranny ground strap grounds the engine, if this isnt there or is poor
the engine ignition etc will get poor electrical power, and could cause
problems... as the engine/tranny is fully insulated from the chassis other
than this(these) strap(s).

My bus turned over the odometer last night on the way home from my bus
club meeting (Missouri Micros, Missouri's first neato chapter, located in
Saint Louis, open to all..)

I had to pull over and use my new digicam to record the event for
posterity, now i have like 5 pix at 99999 and 5 at 00000. This week i will
finally get round to takin gpix of my bus for my website, i'll post when
these are up.

Well, i'd say the swap was a success, this AM i had to back up a tad to
get the tranny out of reverse, it was stuck until i backed up like an
inch, worrisome, but it shifts so well otherwise im not too concerned.

I'm thinking of rebuilding my small nut with a 3.88 and reinstalling it,
but for now im all set.

take care,

Steve

p.s. since im new to busses i think i realized that the noise that worried
me &amp; convinced me to change my tranny was normal reduction gear whine as
its evident with the new tranny(albeit much quieter) , but oh well, the
increased freeway speed will be nice nonetheless... and my redux box had a
bad bearing in the small nut, so i can rebuild the boxes at least at my
leisure...
