Importance: Normal

The earlier sales brochures shows the spare tire sitting in the well
(upright) behind the seat.

Subject line pretty much says it all.  The painting post earlier got me
thinking that it would be nice it my spare weren't lying on the floor of
the treasure chest.  Alternately, ideas on how I could fabricate one would
be nice, too.  I have the wingnut and bracket but have no idea what the
original carrier even looks like...
