Subject: RE: [VB] Westy Window Cranks??

I have found ones that work at my local RV supply shop, you might have luck
there. I found used ones there for a few bucks.

I love to find/buy some!  My bus needs 3.

Repos, fake, anything!  As long as it fits on the crank pole and turns it I
am happy :)

Anyone have the Orchard Supply part number?


Thanks,
