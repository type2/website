Wow!  Half inch!  That'll be a robust plate!

Other sources of leaks include the use of standard nuts in place of
the acorn nuts VW used.  The threads are not sealed, so you have to
have a closed end nut and the proper copper washers to keep the oil in.

One small mod that I did was to grind off the formed drain plug
threads. The metal that is threaded forms a &quot;dam&quot; that allows the
particles at the bottom-most part of the sump to remain in the engine
when the oil is drained.  These particles are probably in a stagnent
flow zone anyway while the engine is running, but I still didn't like
the prospect of leaving junk in the engine.  I brazed a nut to the
bottom of the sump plate to provide threads for the drain plug.

Next item on my hit parade will be a drain plug with a machined groove
for an O-ring.  Maybe I'll even make it a wingnut for no-tools oil
changes!
