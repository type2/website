List...

snipping some stuff,

I am not an expert on this, but have watched my mechanic do this two or 
three times to my 67 deluxe over the years. Here's stuff that I *know* to 
be true and important:

The upper and lower inner bearings are 6306 with the C3 rating (hardness 
or durability). the lower outer bearing is the N207E roller bearing, also 
C3 rated, and the upper outer bearing is the 6305 also C3 rating.

My mechanic removes the brake plates without disassembling and opening 
the brake system (he's good, lazy, and experienced).

My mechanic welds a 13mm type nut onto the center of the freeze plug (the 
'cover' plate which seals the lower stub axle), then uses a homemade easy 
to copy tool which screws into the nut and pulls it out. I believe the 
tool spans two reduction box screw holes and bolts up to them, thus 
giving the anchoring necessary to pull out the freeze plug. To re-use the 
freeze plug, he grinds off the nut, leaving a flat surface. Grease it to 
prevent rusting. Use pullers and drifts to extract and reset the bearings 
as necessary. When removing the stub axle nut which is inside and 
'behind' the freeze plug, tamp down the 'pinches' which lock the nut in 
place - pean it down on reassembly.

I am about to replace the Transform Whining Center Section (transmission) 
on my 67 shortly. If you need parts or info, try calling Rick Long 
Enterprises, in Northern CA at 707-829-1169 - he specializes in 
transaxles and parts for them. I just called in an order today for shims, 
gaskets and stuff to do the switch. I will not be replacing any bearings 
in the reduction boxes as they are all new and okay. 

Long sells FAG bearings and other brands according to your needs.
