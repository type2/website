Hi Jdd,
Unless you know how many miles are on the valves and that his is alot less 
than 100,000 miles it is best to just replace them all.  Having a broken off 
valve ruin a whole engine is alot more expensive than a $10.00 valve.  
Standard made stell valves will after about 100,000 mile shatter off the head 
of the valve when hit sideways with a hammer while the spring end is held in 
a vise.  Stainless valves with about the same mileage in the same test will 
instead bend well over 90 degrees without shattering.  You want the valves 
once the head is rebuilt to have the same stem hieght and the shop most 
likely will machine the inside the head to seal the head to the cylinder 
properly.  This latter proceedure will increase CR and probably cause 
detonation, so you will need to test for CR and probably use a shim between 
the heads and each cylinder.  If you are going to rebuild the engine or 
replace the P&amp;Cs it is much better to shim between the engine case and 
cylinders!!!  Though if your 40 HP engine is a mystery of how many miles on 
it installing new or rebuilt heads and new P&amp;Cs will most likely result in 
another rebuild in 10,000 or less miles due to tired worn main bearings and 
suddenly increased HP and torque on them.
