Subject: RE: [VB] Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

Ah yes, but will BYOB have any room??  I heard they might move the car show
part to make more room for the swap. Remember how big IT was last year? This
year will be even bigger as a lot of people I know who didn't come last year
will be coming this year. At least at the Red Barn there is plenty of room
to expand.

ronnie   getting there early

Well put Thom.
 I didn't go last year because of the wait to get in. 
The year before (2000) that they had to turn people
away at the gates after they waited for hours to get
in. I remember when that show was 50 cars!
 I will go to BYOB, but more than likely will pass on
Kelley Park. It's a shame that they don't have shows
at the Pleasanton fairgrounds anymore. That was a
great place even though it was put on by the Goodguys.
If only we could all ban together and put on our
shows...

&gt; This whole Kelley Park thing is way out of hand.  
&gt; The wait to get
&gt; into the show is now almost equal to the length of
&gt; the show.
&gt; The process for getting into the show is painfully
&gt; slow.  We
&gt; can thank the CalLook punk crowd for their burnouts
&gt; which don't
&gt; let us park on the lawn any more.  People are having
&gt; to line up
&gt; earlier and earlier, which can only go on for so
&gt; long before SJPD
&gt; starts making a fuss - and maybe they already
&gt; have...
&gt; 
&gt; The show *has* to change.  Period.  Not open for
&gt; debate.   It can't 
&gt; continue in it's current format.  The number of cars
&gt; is growing and 
&gt; the area to put them is shrinking.  Don't give me
&gt; the lines about
&gt; how it's put on by a loving club and they work hard,
&gt; yada yada yada.
&gt; Yes, I know. But it's still broke.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some options, off the top of my head:
&gt; 
&gt; * make it a *truly* vintage show.  67 &amp; earlier
&gt; (maybe even 60 and
&gt; earlier).  Get rid of the late models.  
&gt; 
&gt; * make it a real car show - use pre-registration to
&gt; get the
&gt; docket lined up in advance, park everyone else in
&gt; some secure,
&gt; offsite parking.
&gt; 
&gt; * move the show.  Yes, that sucks, but it's a simple
&gt; matter of how
&gt; many cars you can fit in a given area.  You either
&gt; increase the area,
&gt; or shrink the numbers of cars.
&gt; 
&gt; * at the *very* least, streamline the admission
&gt; process.  You
&gt; shouldn't have to stop and talk to 4 different
&gt; people on the way in.
&gt; 
&gt; Having the swap in the lower lot was good, as it
&gt; relieved some of the
&gt; congestion, but it was a MAJOR PITA to traverse
&gt; between the two.
&gt; It was, in essence, two separate shows.  If that's
&gt; not the case
&gt; this year, they're doomed.   The parking lot on the
&gt; north side would
&gt; make more sense, but I guess they can't use that for
&gt; social/economic/political
&gt; reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; Offsite parking has to have *real* security.  From
&gt; what I've seen
&gt; in the past few years, I would *NOT* park my bus in
&gt; one of those lots.
&gt; You're just *begging* to get stuff stolen,
&gt; particularly with the popularity
&gt; of the online fencing sites.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been debating whether I actually want to go or
&gt; not.
