 For lack of a better word, I have noticed that a lot of VW engines in good
 running order have a kind &quot; chirping &quot; sound to them.  Does anyone know what
 could be responsible for that good sound disappearing?  I recently adjusted
 the carb (28PICT-2) mixture as it seemed to run rich (black smoke-ocassional
 backfire) and adjusted valves (1500 cc - .006?) set timing, changed plugs and
 now the engine sounds entirely different.  Runs a liitle stronger, but sounds
 worse. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Most of the time the chirping goes away once the engine warms up.  If not,
then it is a sign of needing the valves adjusted.  Did you adjust your valves
at 0 degrees?  Alot of the original pulleys do not even have a 0 degree mark
on them.  We picked up a degree pulley years ago and use it only to find where
those original pulley marks are and mark where the 180 degree mark on the
original pulley.   Eric &amp; Barb
