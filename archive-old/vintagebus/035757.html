&lt;&lt;     The dormobile is making a whiring/rattlie sound from the 
alternator/fan 
 housing area, sounds kind of like a throw out bearing making its final spin 
 but less harsh. It does it most when I engage the clutch or driving in high 
 RPMs, it worsend considerably when I tightend the belt. 69 motor that looks 
 to have a stock fan housing an alternator that looks fairly new, no obvious 
 external cause. Could this possibly be something in the housing 
 (cracked/flexing fan?) or am I buying a new alternator? any advice/tips are 
 appreciated.

First I would remove the fan belt and start up the motor to make sure that it 
where the noise is coming from.   Doing this for a short time will not hurt 
the motor, it is ok to start it up w/o fan to check if the noise is gone.    

then shut the motor off.  Noise gone?  Turn alt by hand and see if you find 
the noise again.   could be in the alternator or at the fan.   or is the fan 
rubbing at the shroud?   Maybe your bearings are gone in the alt.  With fan 
belt on does it jump around there at the upper pulley?  Can you wiggle that 
threaded bit around up and down with the belt off?
