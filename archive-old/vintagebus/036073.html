lens) from the parts box from my 57 oval and compared them to some NOS and 
German repo's I have and they are exactly the same (lens only), maybe someone 
changed them? I know the housing covers are different and am not sure on the 
bulb holder, I do have a few different styles of those.   ronnie &gt;&gt;

Hi Ronnie,
According to the parts books yellow lense are bus only part number and is 
only listed in the bus parts book.  The clear lense has a type 1 part number, 
but it and the yellow bus part numbered lense are listed in the bus parts 
book for bus.  The nut, lock washer, rubber gasket between the fender/body, 
the bulbholder, bulb, and screws to mount on the housing cover are all same 
between bus, bug, KG.  The packing rubber gasket between the housing of the 
bug fender and bus body/nose are the same, while the KG one is differant.
