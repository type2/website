&gt;&gt;Dan:   I was looking at your web site.   I have a  69mm SPG ROLLER CRANK 
&gt;&gt;that needs to be indexed and trued.  I have tried RIMCO, BERG, FALICON, ED 
&gt;&gt;KORN, SCAT and so far have not been able to find anyone who can deal with 
&gt;&gt;this crank.

A while back, I was discussing VW engine rebuilding with my friend Jim, 
who is a mechanical engineer by trade and an auto-crosser and track
volunteer by hobby, and he mentioned...

&quot;-- if you REALLY want high-end, Andial is probably the absolute top of the 
ladder for German air-cooled boxer motors.  They primarily do racing Porsche
motors, but I've heard rumor that they've done a VW or three.&quot;

Doing a Web search gave me http://www.andial_dot_com/ which I believe is
the shop he is talking about.  There's a Bug parked in the back row of
the picture on their home page, which is perhaps a good sign.  :)  I 
have never done any business with them; I just know they exist.  If
nothing else, they may be able to give you a better lead.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
