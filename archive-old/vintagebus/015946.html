Subject: 36hp rebuild questions



Hi all,

I am researching various aspects of rebuilding a 36 HP
engine for my '59 panel.  The engine that is in the vehicle
is worn (end play around .014&quot;) and I've purchased a used
engine to rebuild.  Part of the reason to build the
replacement engine is to have a better/cleaner/reliable/etc.
engine and part is just for the fun of learning about the
36hp engine, playing with tools, and making a greasy blob into
a clean, smooth running device.

In the process of pulling apart this used engine (I've only got
the heads and left hand cylinders off so far) I have found
that the cylinder heads seem to be in reasonably good shape
except that they need to be rebuilt and they have inserts in
all 4 spark plug holes.  The #3 piston lost a wrist pin
circlip and that piston and cylinder are trash but I have found
a source for new and/or used 36hp pistons and cylinders.

The questions I have for those with more experience than myself
are the following.

Bob Hoover states, in his various sermons on cylinder heads, that
spark plug inserts are bad because they change the way the heat
flows from the spark plug to the head.  Since it would probably
be difficult to find new 36hp cylinder heads, I am wondering just
how bad this heat flow problem is.  The low compression 36hp
engine produces quite a bit less heat than the later model engines,
perhaps the spark plug inserts aren't much of an issue?  experiences?
(These inserts have a large, serrated around the edge, steel flange
on the outside of the spark plug hole, I haven't seen these before.)

Also, has anyone rebuilt their own cylinder heads following Bob
Hoover's 'Head Job' sermon?  That is, buy the step-drill, valve guide
installation tool, hand reamer, etc. and replace the valve guides
yourself?  How did it go?  I figure it would be more cost effective
to just have the job done at a shop but I think it would be fun to
try it myself.

Thanks,
