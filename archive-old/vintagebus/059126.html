&gt; I've noticed that with the ads for the Bosch Blue coil. If you see one for
&gt; under $20 then its probably the cheap Mexican imitation with low output

&gt; since they stopped making them in Germany years ago when everything went HEI
&gt; ignition.

The cheap one doesn't have a ballast resistor built in so probably not
good for points.
