&gt; Well I have finally gotten around to ordering new seat covers....and now i

&gt; one quick question to the list-how do you guys clean the frames? I was
&gt; thinking of taking them down to the self car wash, so I could basically
&gt; pressure wash them. Would this cause some premature rusting-right now there
&gt; is basically no rust on these(a little bit where the metal spikes that grab
&gt; the covers)
&gt;
&gt; The reason I want to clean them(I know they will basically never be seen)
&gt; but they are kind of sticky, and greasy-I guess 37 years does that to you.

I would not pressure-wash them.  They have some sort of preservative on
them which has lasted decades, and should be left alone.  Strip them to
the springs, replace any broken coils, repad and recover!
