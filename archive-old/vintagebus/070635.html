Subject: I did it... swapping engines... help!

Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, we have two engines pulled.
1 - From Annie, the '63 Sundial
2 - From the Red '74 VW Bug - was running yesterday...

Our intent is to put the one from the bug into the bus.  Some differences
though... Check out some the photo's here:
http://community.webshots_dot_com/album/73553425FPIwwm

In particular, I would like to know about the vent on the front of the '74
engine  Case # AH263050).  The older engine doesn't have it and I am pretty
sure my bus doesn't accommodate for it.  Can I block it off?  Remove it?  Cut
a hole in the firewall of the bus to implement it?  Help!

Also, the Alternator/Generator combo on the '74 engine is a combo unit, where
the engine out of the bus is not.  Two distinct devices, inter-wired.
Should/Could I swap them or re-wire the bus to match the newer engine?

Also, a minor issue that may come... on the carb of the '74 engine (Solex,
H30/31 PICT, inD. BRAS), there is a huge hole in the front.  Size of a
dime/penny.  How/Where can I get something that plugs it.  My Father-in-law
tried to find something a while back and was told to glue in a penny or dime,
which he did and it worked pretty well for the last year.  Any thoughts on
it?
