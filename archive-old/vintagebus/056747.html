Once the snap rings, thrust washers and axle shafts are removed from &gt; the

&gt; them without a second opinion.

Hi Joel,
Whoops!  Read your Email a third time!  The crown gears often are stuck due 
to ridge build up of the C-clip holding them in.  You can use a long punch 
and hammer to reach through one crown gear center hole to the inside of the 
other crown gear to tap it out and then do the same to the other crown gear.
