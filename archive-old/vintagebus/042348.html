Subject: [VB] Opinions sought - Cooper and Avon tires

Volks,

I am doing a search of tire properties and have come across Avon/Cooper
(same company, different names in Europe and US).  They manufature the
following tires that will fit our vans:

Man	Avon	Avon	Avon		Cooper		Cooper

Name	AV4	AV4	Turbogrip CR 25	Discoverer LT	SRM II Radial

size	185R14	195R14	185R14		195R14		195R14

L. R.	C	C	C		C		D (2095 LB!)


Anyone have any experience with any of these tires?  I called Cooper and
the gentleman there recommenced the Discoverer and Turbogrip as being
better for traction (none are M+S rated) and the AV4 and SRM II as better
highway tires.  I would probably be willing to make the trade of comfort
for traction, YMMV. He also had a side note that getting Avon tires in the
US would be difficult.
