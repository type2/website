&gt; 1) When I step on the brake with tail lights on, the right side stays lit as 
&gt; a tail light--does not get brighter like the left side does. With the tail 
&gt; lights off, the right brake works okay.

Hi Sue,
Is your bulb turned in 180 degrees the wrong way?  Have you checked that bulb 
for both filaments in working condition?  Also check the individual wires for 
electricty getting through.  One wire is for running lights, the other is for 
turn &amp; brake signals.

&gt; 2) Still no turn signal at right rear. Right front blinks fast fast fast. I 
&gt; checked the directional switch with a test light and that is working fine.  
&gt; Checked the flasher relay (3 prong) and it is working fine. Cleaned all 
&gt; contacts. Checked bulb. What should I do next? I have not hooked up all my 
&gt; wires to the speedo yet--does the one for the signal need to be hooked up 
&gt; for the right rear to work?

Could be your signal switch is bad or needs a good cleaning with electrical 
contact cleaner.  No, it just shows you have flashing signals.

&gt; 3) Hooked up license plate light. Works fine with engine lid in &quot;up&quot; 
&gt; position. The minute I start lowering the engine lid it goes out and stays 
&gt; out. Connections are clean and tight at the fixture, and the ground is 
&gt; good???

Sounds like it only grounds through the engine lid prop arm now.  Try 
applying grease mixed with graphite to the latch and its catch.  Do the same 
for the other doors.  Graphite is a good conductor of electricity and even 
when the grease dries out the graphite is a good lubricant.  This will make 
your doors close easier without the need to slam them to death.
