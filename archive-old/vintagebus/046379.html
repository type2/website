       JEROME JAMBOREE VIII WAS A HUGE SUCCESS !!!!!!!! 
                           (41 clubs officially represented)
    
A BIG THANKS to all who helped at this years event,could`nt have done it
without    you.Big kudoo`s to the Havasu Connectionand Deb for braving the
elements on Thurs. nite,even though i did`nt get my Wild Bill`s,right
John(just kidding).These guy`s and gal eat,sleepand drive VWbuses,and i`m sure
the club will return the favor come BBB III.(jan 99).The count on the caravan
was right around 100 buses,bugs,etc.What a sight on I-17 northbound.Thanks to
Kyle and (MOOOBY) for bringing up the rear.Only stopped twice,which involved
no towing of any caravan vehicles.HOORAY!!!!
            THE TOW CONTINUES.................... 
   The F*#d only towed two this time.One ratty,primered.beater could it have
been Mr.VanBondo,one could only wonder.The other expertly Krylon sprayed jewel
of Hormel Seitz.Just ask Sean what happens when you pull Camp Verde hill
(mtn.) in 4th,then continue on at 85 m.p.h for the next 35 miles.Do i smell a
melted #4 piston(way to go dude).Jerry we missed your announcing,i know Jon`s
voice did.More info. to follow later.(i.e.# of splitties,loafs,etc.).
    Thank you to all who donated to the raffle bus.You saw the outcome,what a
great looking bus.Went to Sacramento Ca.,we now have a another first time bus
owner.Keep on Bussing....................................
             Last but not least,a big thank you to Mr.Don Robertson,owner of
the Gold King Mine and all Jerome Jamboree attendees.SEE YOU IN SEP 99`.

P.S.I also got to meet Clara(what a wild listee)
