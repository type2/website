Subject: Volkswagen doesn't stop - front brake ???'s

So the brake pedal's been kinda low lately.  Today it went to the floor.
Doh!  Fluid reservoir empty.  Refill, drive home with hand reaching for
e-brake.

Looked like the left front side was leaking.  Pulled off that wheel,
everything looks fine.  Right front side looks really wet from the back.
So, pulled off that one too.  Uh-oh.  The nuts that held the wheel on were
really loose, I just spun them off by hand.  So I'm guessing both the
bearings are garbage?  The drum was really hard to get off, too, it just
wanted to tilt back and forth.  An hour or so of hammering and sweet-talking
later, it came off.

Ok, so this is the really bad wheel.  wet black crud everywhere, the rubber
seal on the top wheel cylinder is torn and sitting off to the side.  It's a
mess.

I haven't done brakes in awhile, so I have some dumb questions.  I think the
correct thing to do here would be to replace all four front wheel cylinders.
Not to mention the bearings.  But of course this happens at a time when I'm
flat broke.  What would be the minimum &quot;just-for-now&quot; fix-it job?  Is there
anything I'm overlooking here?

Thanks in advance,
Diana
