I  do not really have that much body work that needs to be done.   So it
would cost me more for the welder then it would be worth (especially after I 
purchased all the other tools that i would need).  I also do not really have 
the time to take a class as I want to have it done by the end of May so I 
can attend the classic.
thanks
domonic
