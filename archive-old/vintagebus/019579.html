I know the guy who redid that bus pictured...he re-did
all the veneer (sp?) on the cabinets in that
bus....did refinishinga nd all new wood panels....so I
would not use that bus as guide to go by...its
probably all wrong-ish

&gt; the only interior pic I can find is

&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/image/dunni-6.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; is that the right color wood for the side door
&gt; panels ? (looks darker than 
&gt; the roof panels)
&gt; 
&gt; there is no tank under the seat for the water -looks
&gt; like it was never there
&gt; 
&gt; also no ice box on the drivers side rear, just the
&gt; normal cabinet on the 
&gt; passenger side rear........is it missing ? or was
&gt; that an option ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; any pictures of an original one
&gt; appreciated.......thanks
