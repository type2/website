 difference between a 36hp manifold?

Hi Eric,
Well the problem with pre-1954 parts is that they are likely to have the old L
### part number instead of the 111, 113, or 211 parts numbers.  The best way
to check both the intake manifold and heads of supposed 25 HP engine parts is
to measure the bottom of the intake legs that should fit the 30mm bore in the
top of the heads.  When VW went to the 36 HP this measurement increased to
31mm.  Eric &amp; Barb

on the other hand, the change in part numbers is useful for identifying parts
made 53 and earlier.   

part number 111 129 701 for 25hp manifold, if it is one sold by VW after the
part numbers changed (1954)  (to engine # 20- 695 355) is listed in the 58 ed
Parts List
