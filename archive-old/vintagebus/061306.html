&gt; aside, I don't want scoops on the side (or coolers

&gt; understand that a location on the underside is

Jim, I believe that I wrote that my &quot;Martha Stewart&quot;
scoops didn't help at all, but a type IV cooler really
helped (to the extent of 30 degrees or so of
cooling)(or perhaps Ronnie's favorite, a tight fin
type 3 cooler).  I helped John Kyte install a couple
coolers on the underside of his busses, but for a
1776, w/ big valve heads, and a mild cam, the type 4
cooler was adequate for me.
