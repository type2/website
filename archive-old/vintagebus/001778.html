I'd go ahead and get the engine, clean it up and see if it runs.  I bought a
junkyard engine back in 95 for a baja I had, paid $250. for it, put it in
and, it's still running as a daily driver so, sometimes they are a good
deal.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday, with not a lot to do, I headed out to the Pick-n-Pull (a do it
&gt; yourself junkyard) to see what there was to see.  I didn't get much, but I
&gt; did come across a windshield washer bottle with motor from a Mazda, which
is
&gt; going to go in my '67 Kombi camper.....I don't like the looks and the
parcel
&gt; tray space required for the stock squirters....not to mention the
&gt; price.....and this one will fit in the small, flat space I'll be making
for
&gt; it in the passenger side kick panel.  I'll probably mount the switch under
&gt; the parcel tray.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the question:  There is a 1971 Kombi with a complete upright
&gt; (probably 1600 dp) engine including air cooler, and although the tag by
the
&gt; door sez 1971, it looks like a '68 or '69....the reverse lights are
separate
&gt; from the taillights.....what's the deal with this?  Anyway.....here's the
&gt; question....should I buy the engine for about $130, rebuild it (it my or
may
&gt; not need it...there was compression in all cylinders, but the whole thing
&gt; was covered with oil...I'd rebuild it anyway!)  and keep it as a spare for
&gt; my '67 Kombi, and possibly the '65 or '66 Deluxe I'm hoping to aquire??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Gene
&gt;
