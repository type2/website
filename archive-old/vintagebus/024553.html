Subject: Stolen Bus.  So. Cal  Description
References: &lt;199811301728.KAA10389_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Just a heads up here.  All you So Cal's, remember that the Pomona Swap is to
&gt; be held this coming weekend (dec 6th).

I will definetly be looking for a freshly painted bus or parts out there.   Here
is a description.

65 Standard deluxe.  Forrest (a bit brighter actually) green and green white.
Trim in perfect shape.  front floot rusted thru and repaired with what ever metal
was available.  Rust hole outside behind drivers dog leg. (most obvious)  front
has surface rust with cancer soon along lower edge.  1600 DP with full flow
mounted to left of engine compartment (inside)  Window frames all bubbly rusty.
Different colors too.  Florida plates.  Cut dash.

Any help would be apreciated.

Matthew
