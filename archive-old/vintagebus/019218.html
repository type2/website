Just a reminder to follow basic safety rules when working on gas
tanks, particularly if you're doing anything that might even possibly
consider thinking about generating a spark (like, say, poking a piece
of wire around inside the tank):

- first purge the tank with water (completely fill, then drain)
- if welding, fill the tank with either sand or water (not the same
  water you purged it with)
