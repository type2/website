Subject: Re: Concrete


In the mill where I work, we &quot;place&quot; a fair amount of concrete (last
pour was 95 cu. yd.).  We use both.  Rebar and the fiber additive.  We
have extreme temperature fluctuations (100 degF summer to -20 degF
winter) in this part of the world and the additive seems to help
preclude cracking.

Another thing you might consider is adding a tie-down point in the
slab.  In the past, I've used a 1.5&quot; forged eyebolt welded to a rebar
'spider' set in the slab. Put it in a 6&quot; Square, deep electrical box. 
A very useful accessory for straightening bumpers and the like.

For a household 'shop', 4&quot;-6&quot; has been satisfactory in my experience
but thicker *is* better.  It just depends on how deep your pockets
are...  Volkswagens just aren't that heavy.
