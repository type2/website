Subject: The NQ California trip

Assuming that I get over this massive VW slump that robs me of my desire to
work on the damn thing and I actually make it to or partway to California, I
had this idea.

Why not mount a webcam on or in the bus so that at anytime, you could
connect to a website and view our big 2 week roadtrip to Cali.  I discussed
this with Kirin and the only way to have it full time is via a remote
satellite or cell link which would cost lotsa bucks.

So Kirin mentioned why not try to get some big oil mogul or gas station
chain to sponsor us.  We simply cruise and have fun but we only stop to fuel
at the sponsor's gas station, brag about how great the gas is and how
friendly the tellers are at the stations, etc.  Then as for the satellite or
telecommunications part of it could simply have a big advertisement as well
as the oil mogul on the website just prior to the actual webcam viewing.
It's a far flung idea but it might be neat to have a full time camera on so
people could follow our whole 2 week saga.

Any ideas along this route?
