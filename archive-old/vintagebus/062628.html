Subject: RE: [VB] Tranny question

You will need to remove the transaxle.There is a splined sleeve with a gear on it to hold the input shaft to the main shaft of the trans.I forgot which redux box will need to be taken apart to get the side cover off for access to the input shaft joint.When installing a NEW snap ring safety wire the eyes together after install.

From: Matt Faust 

Hi all,

 I just finished removing the engine from my ' 63 Westy for a rebuild.  It is the first time I've had the engine out.  The trans seemed to shift well, but I haven't driven the bus too much.  When I pulled the engine out, the input shaft for the trans came out with it...There is a snap ring on the trans side of the shaft that was partially off,  and that's it.  What should be in the trans to hold the shaft in?  Will I have to rebuild the trans too ?

Any ideas/ information is appreciated

Thanks,

Matt
