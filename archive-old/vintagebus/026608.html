Happy New Year All,

After spending the last few months just driving the '60 double cab with
the type IV motor, I set a lot of lofty goals to accomplish over the
christmas/new years break.  One of them was to finish the '69 beam
refurbish with disc brakes from a '79 bus and get it installed on the
old double cab.

I got the Bus Boys' adjusters welded on the beam and got the beam and
torsion arms all cleaned up, primered and painted.  That's were it sat
for the last week until today.  I started reassembling everything and
promptly put the lower arms on the wrong side, with them ending upside
down.  I kept looking at it and thinking that it wasn't looking right.
I got the spindle up to it and immediately figured out what I had done.
(It's been over 6 months since I disassembled everything at the junk
yard).  I fixed that one and then finished putting on the spindles.
Later this afternoon, I put the sway bar back on with fresh rubber and
clamps, stood back and did it again.  Put the arm on upside down.  Took
it off, flipped it over and back it went.

I was able to turn the discs and get them and the calipers and new pads
all on there and its not even too late.  I guess the moral of this story
is that I should have taken a few minutes to review the bentley manual
before starting as the few minutes, 6 months ago that I spent
disassembling this thing obviously were not enough for the picture to
burn into my brain and stay there.

I still have to weld a plate to the beam to support the brake master
cylinder assembly, so maybe sometime next week, I should be to the
process of swapping out front beams and setting the ride height to
stock.

I guess the paint will have to keep on waiting.

Scott
