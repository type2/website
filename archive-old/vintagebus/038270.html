	&gt;&gt; zigged a bead around the pipe to heater box contact area on both
&gt; ends. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
Josh,

	i just read an article in Hot VW's about the heating system.  AND as
I recall, that gap has the purpos of making sure your heaterboxes don't melt
down when you have the heater box flap closed (for summer and stuff)

	Check it out.  I may be wrong....
