&lt;&lt;well,

I wont go off on the whole need thing again... but if you are looking for
a 59+ truck bumper they are one year only... (60 and up had a regular bus
bumper) But 68-71 bay bumpers and splittie bumpers have the same profile i
think, you could weld your ends onto a more readily available bay bumper
center.

If you need a stamped one, good luck to you.

take care.

Not true.
59-61 trucks use the EXACT same press bumper as busses, only difference is a 
slightly heavier notch on the inside corners.
Very slight and bumpers can be modified back and forth fairly easily.
They switched the shape of the corner in 62 with the taillight change and 
they used the same bumper between bus and truck form here on out.
My old LATE 1960 singlecab has this truck notched bumper.
I saw a NOS truck bumper at the latest pomona, but 800$ yeowch!
