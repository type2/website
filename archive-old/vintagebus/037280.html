&lt;&lt; Actually that is not correct, the axles from split case transmissions have 
a
 little ball in the paddle end that is spring loaded, what this is for I
 don't know, but taken 2 split cases apart and both of these had the ball
 bearings in the paddles, I have another 58 split case I'll eventually pull
 apart and will report on those axles. 
  &gt;&gt;
yes VW did change the design of the axles slightly, some have the ball, some 
dont.  However, this change was not at the split case/tunnel change, and if 
you read your Bentley in the axle section it does say they are 
interchangable.  its one of those changes I doubt they changed the part 
number for.
