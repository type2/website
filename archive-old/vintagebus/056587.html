Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

When Erin 'No Quarter and I drove out to the Classic last year in my SC we
saw all the splitties out there in CA and AZ but while we were driving on a
back road in western Nebraska we came over a hill and there was a beat up
old westie going the other way. It was the only other one we saw after we
left the west coast other than in junkyards.   It had a decrepit old man
driving and he looked wired and was moving about 40 mph.  By the time we got
stopped and turned around he was out of sight but we caught up with him in
no time and pulled up next to him and motioned for him to pull over.  Well
if Erin and I had pulled next to me there would of been no way I was going
to stop but he did.  We shook hands and introduced ourselves and he was some
old writer from NY and he was headed west to CA.  He used the back roads
cause people just go tooo fast in the open area of Nebraska/Kansas.  He had
a desk and a old typewriter sitting on the desk in the back of this bus and
than he just popped in to his bus and headed west.  He did say that this was
his 17th trip in the bus from NY to LA and back.  The bus sounded like it
was running poorly and I bet his top speed would of been 45mph.  Hope that
he didn't have to get on any big highways between here and there
Pretty much when ever I see a bus around here it is someone I know or
someone I am about to know after they find the AIRS site

&gt; &gt;i know the &quot;bus sightings&quot; were more out of excitment, but if i did that
every
&gt; &gt;time i saw a bus, i'd never be able to stop typing.
&gt;
&gt; Split busses are VERY RARE around here. Because of me there are now a
&gt; few more in town. But none of those are even on the road right now.
&gt; And all my others are non-running too. So it's just my lonely '59. A
&gt; bus sighting is usually one driving through town. Very rare, but VERY
&gt; cool when I, or someone I know, sees one.
