Hi,

The rack you want is a 1/3 Westfalia rack.  It goes behind the poptop. 
BTW you will also need two sections of alum. channel that is screwed or
pop-rivited to the drip rail.  One section is very long and goes from
the front of the bus to where the first leg of the 1/3 rack leg goes. 
The second section goes from behind the leg towards the back.

BTW these are very hard to locate.  I've been trying to find the longer
section for about a year and a half. 

Good luck in you're search.

Steve
