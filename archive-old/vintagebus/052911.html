Subject: Re: [VB] 28 PCI jetting

Joel,
  That looks correct to me.  Sounds like just an idle mixture problem.  Lots
of things can affect idle, most commonly dirt in the idle circuit, and
vacuum leaks.  Old engines and carbs can be temperamental, it might take a
bit of fuss before you hit the &quot;sweet spot&quot;.
 If there is any side to side free-play in the throttle shaft, you either
need another carb or in the case of 28pci, just have it rebushed.  We do
them here at the shop.

&gt; Buslist-
&gt; Do I have this right? (Al's question is at the bottom.)
&gt;
&gt; Al-
&gt; I don't know when exactly the main sprayer (and hence the main jet)
&gt; really starts going. What sprays when is determined by the vacuum
&gt; present in the carb at any given time. When the throttle is closed or
&gt; almost closed, vacuum is low and just a little gas is sucked out
&gt; through those small holes near the throttle plate, via the pilot jet
&gt; (and the mains, but flow here isn't enough for the main jet to have
&gt; much restrictive effect). As the throttle is opened more, vacuum
&gt; increases, and more gas is sucked through these progressively higher
&gt; holes, until sufficient vacuum exists (throttle largely open) to begin
&gt; sucking gas through that main sprayer arm, dead centre of the carb
&gt; barrel. This gas doesn't flow via the pilot jet or auxillary jet like
&gt; the stuff which comes out the holes near the throttle plate, it comes
&gt; straight through the main jet. So the mains doesn't really come into
&gt; play until your engine picks up speed. And when the throttle is wide
&gt; wide open and the motor is winding up like she's going to explode the
&gt; air correction jet starts letting in a little extra stream of air
&gt; bubbles into the gas flow to lean out the mixture some.
&gt; If your bus is stalling at idle I would guess either your mixture
&gt; screw is out too far or your pilot jet is too big. Emphasis on guess.
&gt; But it is a bit harsh judging a bus by how it behaves cold...

&gt; Joel,
&gt; Put the bus away for winter, but latest adjustments have made for a
&gt; 900
&gt; rpm idle that stall easy at stops, especially when just running 10
&gt; minutes or so. Still not hot enough oil I think, real shitty heat. I
&gt; imagine I am too rich still at the pilot and aux levels? When can the
&gt; main be taken into consideration? At a particular load/rpm, or
&gt; throttle
&gt; level? I am confused on this point. Seems like I am still after a
&gt; meaner/leaner idle...
