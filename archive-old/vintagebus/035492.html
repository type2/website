&lt;&lt; No.  You need to figure out what you did wrong when you installed the axle
 seal.  Is the seal in straight?  Did you install the sling washer?  How
 about the O-rings? &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
One also has to assemble the spacer that rides between the axle and axle seal
inside of the seal (After the seal is pressed into the outer cover.) before
both are installed onto the brake backing plate.
He could also have a bad spacer that rides inside of the axle seal.  That
happened to us and caused a slow but steady leak to and from Sacramento last
time.  Either it was just too small of diameter from years of seal wear on
it, or maybe a little rust had left pits in it where the seal rode.  After
sanding the spacer with very fine sandpaper and again a new axle seal it
still leaked so we just replaced the spacer and low and behold the leak
completely stopped.   Eric&amp;Barb
