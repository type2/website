Well list here is my plea... I am so tired of not having a prop rod on my
engine compartment of my 63. So I thought I would ask if anyone could help
me out. It seems the tab that comes off the bus and attaches to the prop rod
is broken off. Does anyone have a parts bus they would be willing to cut
this little piece off for me? A prop rod and spring would also be nice if
some has one. I have cash and/or parts to trade if you can help out.

On anther note I am looking to put a new motor in this same bus I was going
to have NW connecting rod build it for me and was thinking about a 1776
single port setup. Someone years ago said that this setup with the right cam
makes a great &quot;tractor&quot; style motor for pulling a trailer (I have a small
camper trailer). I checked the archives and did not find anything on 1776
single port motors, what is the consensus on this? currently I have a 1600
in the bus with a freeway flyer and reduction boxes. The motor it's self
still runs strong after 168,000 miles on it's current rebuild (has between
(138 to 141 in all 4 cylinders), but I am afraid that if I start towing with
her she will probably give out.

Thanks in advance
Shawn

Oh ya lastly I am still looking for a VW or Westphalia tow hitch. I will
have to make a home brew soon if I cant find one. The NOS one I found in
Germany for a whopping $700 bucks is going to stay in Germany for that
price.
