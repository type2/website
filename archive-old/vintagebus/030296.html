&gt; Was that the same panel that someone was selling as NOS at Pomona?  If so,
&gt; the fabric looked identical to the repro stuff being sold by TMI.  A fellow
&gt; list member has just done his 21 window in this stuff (which is very close
&gt; to original), and we both looked at the panel and agreed that while nice, it
&gt; was not NOS.  NOS trim maybe.

That was me at Pomona...........

NOS as far as I know. I know where it originally came from, and when. No TMI
stuff was available then. Over 4 years ago........
