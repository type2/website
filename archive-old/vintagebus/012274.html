  being in the wet, cold and windy weather of so cal
there were some good deals at pomona, there were ( i saw) 3 sets of ambulance fans there complete and working for under 150.00 asking, got me 1 should have bartered and got a couple of more
so if you are looking for these check out the next pomona. 
  ps the guy from the thing shop in cal had a pearl
white fan that he didn't sell for 150.00 if you need one.
