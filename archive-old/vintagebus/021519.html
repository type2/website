&gt;  On my way back to the office just now, I happened upon a guy laying under
&gt;  his bus.  It's a 1600 DP and it's cutting out when he touches the gas
&gt;  pedal, but if you give it a lot of gas quickly, it'll run fine.  Timing
&gt;  is set at 7.5, but I moved it and it still cut out.  It's a 009 dizzy. 
&gt;  Can't think of anything else to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;  I can't get to the archive right now.  Anyone have a quick fix?  I'd like
&gt;  to run back by there and help him out.  He's driving to Seattle tonight.
