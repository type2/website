&gt; &gt;    My wife has wanted a new car for a long time now. It's to hot for her
to
&gt; &gt; drive her rag top beetle, she won't drive any of my buses, so I went out
and
&gt; &gt; bought her a NEW car. I really would of liked to get her a VW product,
but
&gt; &gt; with all the BS that VW is doing I followed suit and bought her a PT
Cruiser
&gt; &gt; (at least it looks retro) instead of a VW product (I really wanted a
&gt; &gt; Eurovan).. I am going to take a pic of it in front of my 6 buses and her
bug
&gt; &gt; at my house and send it to VWoA customer relations with a note saying &quot;
I
&gt; &gt; would have bought one of your products, but with no support of VWoA in
the
&gt; &gt; vintage community I refuse to help support you (VWoA)

My wife is looking for a car to replace her trusty Beetle (which will go
into genteel retirement) and we're of a similar mind.  We looked at the PT
Cruiser, but the one we test-drove had two obvious defects (alternator
bearing squealing and a funny clunk and drop in the front end when going
around corners.  That and the slimiest &quot;they all make that noise&quot; salesman
soured us to the deal.

Seems that most folks who used to buy
VWs are now buying Hondas.  We looked at the CRV, but the new Element
coming out in November seems to have a lot of bus philosophy and utility
built into it.
