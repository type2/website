&lt;&lt;The garage maintains that it did not replace the clutch cable, yet it was 
apparently the correct length prior to the clutch being replaced and too long 
afterwards (it had been shimmed to try and reduce the  effective length but 
was still too long). Why could this be?  &gt;&gt;
As a best guess is that your original clutch cable was stretching toward 
breaking.  So this caused you to glaze the clutch disc due to not entirely 
disengaging the engine from the tranny.  Causing less fiction and slipping of 
the clutch components which feels like less power.  So they may have replaced 
the clutch parts and installed a cable of too long of length, or if the cable 
was too long to begin with, and left that way the clutch disc and pressure 
plate would end up in the same condition as before.

another possibility is that with a different clutch, particularly when it's a 
different style, the distance to push the throw out bearing is different, and 
neccessitates adjusting the clutch cable when the engine is reinstalled with 
a different clutch.  been there.   though it didn't make the cable seem too 
long.  hm....

(btw, I didn't see the original post, so excuse me if I am off target or 
missing something)
