&lt;&lt; I dont bother with polarizing anymore. And you shouldn't either. 
 Why? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Here is the why you should.  If the generator has sat around long enough it 
could easily have lost it's polarization.  Result?  After about 15 minutes to 
two hours the generator fries itself!  So you say?  Well can you remove, and 
replace the generator in less than five easy minutes?  No.  So if one 
polarizes thier generator before installing they do two things.  This checks 
that the generator actually is going to work in the first place, and is going 
to continue to work once installed.  Since it only takes less than a minute 
to polarize a generator it is a small use of time that can easily save one 
far more time, and engine pulls in the long run.
Kind of like our friend Bob.  He had a problem with starting his bus not 
starting due to a slow starter.  We suggested he take off the ground strap 
off of one of his other VWs, and install it in his bus to see if the bus 
ground strap was bad.  But oh no, Bob had a lifetime starter!  So he replaced 
the starter, once twice, three times!  Finally he replaced the ground strap.  
Low and behold the bus started instantly!  Result?  Probably about 15 minutes 
wasted for each starter replacement, plus however long it took to drive to 
the FLAPS each time.  Instead of just taking five minutes to check the ground 
strap!   So unless your FLAPS is ready to pay you for your wasted time, 
polarize!   Eric&amp;Barb
