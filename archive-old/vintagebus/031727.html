  I just got an e-mail from my friend who found the 54 BD, it is in his
position now, I will have pic's of it soon or he will post them. They are
still out there to be found. This bus is supposed to be pretty complete with
all seats (yes middle) and all parts associated with it. The story goes that
it probably lost a trans 20-30-40? years ago and the owner started to pull
the trans but stopped for some reason, eventually died, so there the bus sat
on blocks for who knows how long. It's nice to hear these stories and am
looking forward to seeing this BD on the road again.

   The Yuma show was fun and is something I will do again. Next years plans
are to have a camp-out on the Friday night before the show, at the show
location so you won't have to move on Saturday, that will leave Sunday open
to drive home, go into Mexico for shopping, etc. Hope to see more of you
there next year.
