Sam W at aol_dot_com, sorry I don't have you address.

I noticed in an old post you had access to some old hubcaps, about $1 each. I have a '65, and recently had a blowout, put the spare on, and the hubcap, but didn't notice that a few clips were missing from the spare. So I lost my nice chrome hubcap. If those hubcaps are still avaialble let me know, as I would be interested. 
   Thanks 


Sorry to post all, but I am not sure how to email this individual on the list.
