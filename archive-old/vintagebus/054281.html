Thomas,

The problem may stem from your exhaust.  If you are in cold climates, cold
air leaking in from the exhaust  will cause a backfire.  When the engine is
warmed up the air around the exhaust is not cold.

Recently my bus started backfiring on the morning
start up.  I get =

starts right up with =
an immediate backfire.  Proceeds to run fine and if I

will start right back up with no backfire.  Also get
no backfire when I =
start her up to go home from work at night.

Any ideas?

Thanks
