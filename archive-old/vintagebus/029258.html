Subject: murder

Support local gun enforcement??

Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought she was decapitated. Was she
decapitated with a knife??

Supporting a three strikes law makes perfect sence: perhaps local gun
enforcement does too, but it certainly doesn't follow from the facts of
this case.

In fact, she might still be around if she were packin a rod herself.
