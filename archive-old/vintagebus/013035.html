Wagons... HO!
It is shaping up that several folks will be dragging AZ from Phoenix to the
Classic in various 36hp power buses.
 
To my knowledge Everett Barnes, Richard Kimbrough, with prodding maybe Andy
Kunz, myself, maybe Dave Easterwood and hopefully our buddy and non-listee
Dane Dawson from NM will be taking the plunge.

Please contact myself or others on the below list if you are interested.
Personally, I am struggling to get my Barn back together and roadworthy.
Several issues remain. Regardless, I plan on joining this caravan. 

My hopes are to start out **WAY-MONDO-SUPER** early on Friday AM June 11th.
My 10 hr work shift is slated to be completed at 01:00hrs Friday. With luck
I'd escape town in a rush at 03:00AM. That's the best that I can do. &lt;Dang!&gt;

Origin of Departure: Central Phoenix,AZ
Destination: Holiday Inn, Irvine,CA &lt;-might change if safe and restful
Friday PM location near Anaheim is confirmed.

Any other horse power imparred bus/bug/Ghia/or Coach Built is welcome to
hook up. We will be schlugging along at an estimated 45-58 mph. Ambient
temperatures will be 100-105F at least. So be warned! Brutal &quot;fun&quot; for the
wicked I suppose.

Please contact myself or others on the below list if you are interested.
Serious Inquiries via off-list Pmail please.
