Hello Friends,

Found the engine skip... broken spark plug wire. Gen light still on,
though. I'm hoping I can work out a trade with a fellow listee for an
alternator...

Drove to my Bro-in-law's place, about 2 miles. No noise, but having some
problem shifting gears. I think it may be the throwout arm or bearing...
Other than that, no noise, no popping out of gear, etc. I will attempt
the 10 mile trip to work in the morning...

More later...

david
