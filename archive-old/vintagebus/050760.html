&gt; The ones on the driver's side came off just fine.  However the one on the
&gt; passenger side (the one that was bad) wont budge.  Ive beat on it, shot it
&gt; full of WD40 and I even used nasty words.  Still no luck.
&gt;
&gt; Ideas????

Use real penetrating oil.  Kroil, liquid wrench, pb blaster, etc.

Use a hefty puller.  I use a Chevy pitman arm puller with a spacer to make
it a close fit.

Heat is your friend if you have a torch.  Propane may be somewhat helpful,
but a real welding torch is better.

Patience.  Leave the puller on it with tension applied and let time do the
work.
