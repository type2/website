Hey all...
First off, thanks to everyone who gave advice about my windshields. I chose 
to go the cheap route and have a glass shop cut them, it cost $65 for the 
pair. I almost cried however when I took out the old ones and saw the sorry 
state of my sills. Rust city! I guess that would explain the rust trail down 
the dash into the clock. Since the nose is also crunched down by the &quot;V&quot; in 
the trim I'm thinking I need a new front clip. Any advice on mail order (RMM) 
type vs. a donor piece? Donor busses are almost non-existent where I am, so 
I'm not really sure that is even an option.
Also I am just beginning to rebuild my 1500 SP and have a couple of questions:
1. I have a Webber carb with a square aluminum plate on the top that is 
stamped W-223065 on the top edge and L 85 on the bottom edge. I assume the PO 
put this in, as it is pretty rigged - like the rubber eraser plugging what 
must be the vaccum hole. Is this a good carb for a stock SP, and if so should 
I go against the advice of the Idiot Book and attempt to rebuild it myself or 
just dump it for a Solex unit?
2. I am debating weather or not to use bigger pistons and cylinders (the 1600 
size). I plan to leave everything else stock. I have been told that they will 
bolt right on in place of the stock ones with no additional mods needed. 
Also, what is a good brand to use?
