I am looking at buying some parts books.

What do these books normaly go for?  Are there any that are better than 
others?

I am looking to get not only vintage bus but parts books for bays and 
beetles as well as type 3 and type 4 so if anyone has any comments on what 
these would normally go for that would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Mike
