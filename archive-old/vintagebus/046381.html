 Hi Brad,
Well if you mean the clutch out by leaving the clutch pedal alone.  Then if
the engine is ot running by itself when cold, but pumping the gas pedal does
not keep it running.  Then the things to check are.
1. Is gas pumping out of the accelerator nozzle in the carb?  You will need to
remove the air cleaner and use a flash light and small hand mirror to see this
while someone is pumping the gas pedal for you.  
2.  Is the choke closed all the way?  If so you might want to adjust it to the
fully open position for now. 
3.  Have you fully tuned the engine?  Plus when was the air
cleaner/engine/tranny oils replaced last?  Remember that after changing oil,
even running the engine for only a minute lets gas get by the rings and start
the oil to turn into acid.  Which is why the 3,000 mile or 6 months which ever
comes first rule to changing engine oil.
