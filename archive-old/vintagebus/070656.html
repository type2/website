Subject: Parts desk ordering experience 

When in the middle of the search for a nice shift rod boot, I asked the
parts guy to tell me the cost of a '211xxxxxx'.  He turned to his
computer and tried to figure how to enter the number.  What is that? Was
his replied.

&gt;&gt; Are you saying from a VW &quot;dealer&quot;??  The parts guys
at dealerships around here balk if I go in and ask for
parts for a 1995 VW (almost too old they say) let
alone a 1965!&lt;&lt;

&gt;Same here. About a year ago I went into a local VW
Dealer, Century VW in Loveland, Ohio to be specific,
with a problem with my wife's old Cabriolet. while
waiting at the parts counter, I notice this really
cool big vintage poster ad showing a sailboat packed
into a split window bus. So I say to the guy, &quot;So can
you guys get me air-cooled parts for my 66 as well?&quot; 
The guy looked at me and laughed. No lie, he actually
laughed! After a pause and him finally realizing that
I was asking a REAL question which required a REAL
answer, her simply said, &quot;No.&quot;
