I agree with Karl.  The vehicle _illustrated_ in the brochure is definitely
a 1970 Campmobile.  In fact, it's identical to my '70 Campmobile except for
the hubcaps.

However, the text is very clearly in reference a 1972 vehicle.

On page 2 of the brochure the text says: &quot;And for 1972, engine rating has
been increased to...&quot;.

Page 8 gives engine specs for a 1700 engine.

Page 9 text says power front disk brakes are fitted, and also mentions steel
belted radial tires [185 SR 14ZX].  Interesting that &quot;Reinforced&quot; isn't
stated here.

Page 9 also lists 5 seat belts [2 front, 3 rear], yet in the photos on page
6 the kids are unbelted and no belts are in sight.  The kids are shown
lounging on the bed, etc., while the vehicle is driven in traffic [note also
the compass on the dash to the right of the man driving].

I believe a frugal sales/promotion department simply recycled a nicely
illustrated '70 brochure for the 1972 model year, and updated the text as
needed.

Case closed?

&gt;&gt;  Going by USA buses:
Square sidemarkers started in 70 [69 + 69 were round]
Round bumpers were 68 to 72.
Can't see tail lights....the long ones started in 72.
Has large-five hubcaps, last year was 70.
So....this is a 70....1st year of square sidemarkers and last year of
large-five wheels.  &lt;&lt;
