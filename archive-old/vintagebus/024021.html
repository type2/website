Just done a straight swap between my old cracked
Pierburg fuel pump and a new (Brazilian) one on a brand
new (reconditioned) engine. Now it turns over but won't
catch. Is there any way to check on low pressure
without having the correct VW guage? That's what I
suspect as even after cranking it for 30 secs with lots
of throttle, there's not really an appreciable smell of
fuel.

If there's enough pressure might it be a carb
adjustment that I need? My rather tatty workshop manual
is missing most of the carb pages for some reason....
