&gt; The 205's will go on but the manufactures claim that it pinches up the tread

&gt; going to go for it and see how it does. 

Hi Craig,
In the 10+ years we have been running 205, 215, and even 235 tires we have 
not noticed any problems or even had uneven tread wear on our buses in over 
250,000 miles.  So for us it is a not a problem.
