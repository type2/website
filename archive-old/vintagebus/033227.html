Not to be too anal but the Binz was a coachbuilt like the Hebmeuler so the 
term &quot;custom&quot; isn't 100% accurate.  8-)   &lt;&lt;Vintage nazi mode off&gt;&gt;   

You could either take your single cab to the Binz factory (in Germany) or 
order a conversion through the Volkswagen dealer network.  It was Special 
Order 16, or SO16 from a dealer.  The ones from the dealers were sold in and 
around the 1958 model year which is why most Binz are 58's.  The fact that 
they did conversions for individuals accounts for Binz of varying 
years...there is supposed to be a barndoor Binz out there somewhere, could be 
a Volkswagen urban legend though.

The trucks sold through the dealer network were sent to the Binz factory in 
primer.  They were painted at Binz after the conversion.  The paint job at 
Binz was adequate at best, on mine they didn't even pull out the ashtray 
before painting.  If you pull it out there is a ring of primer around the 
opening where the lip of the ashtray covered it up.  The engine compartment 
was also left in primer.  Most of the Binz were painted blue though there is 
at least one reported to have been white originally.

&lt;&lt; Basically, a Binz is a Volkswagen Double Cab produced before &quot;formal&quot; 
Double Cab production began during 1959.  It is a custom vehicle made from a 
factory-delivered Single Cab. It has several unique features, among them the 
back seat, the shortened side gates, custom windows for the passenger area, 
the rear door, and the partition between the front and rear seats. &gt;&gt;
