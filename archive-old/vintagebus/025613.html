I usually do it by trial and error.  Try to install the engine with the new
12v flywheel.  Since aluminum is soft you will see marks on your bellhousing
where the flywheel wont fit.  It helps to turn the motor over as you press
the motor forward.  This way you will see the catch marks easier.  Start
grinding at these locations.  Dont go overboard, but it does take quite a bit
of grinding to get the thing to fit.  Try to install again, if not, grind
again at the marks till the thing fits.

Word of warning.  Where proper safety gear, i.e. glasses gloves, hat, long
sleeve shirt and you should also where a resperator of sorts.  Also, careful
when grinding near the tranny mounts.  If you hit the steel bolts here, they
will spark and ignite all that alum/mag dust you have been creating.  Makes
for a hell of a fireworks show.  Make sure there is no gas around.
