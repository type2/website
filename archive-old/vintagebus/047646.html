&lt;&lt; Are these westy cups?

 Also, anyone know what these puppies are worth, if they are westy cups?
 These are NOS still wrapped in tissue paper. &gt;&gt;
Hi Christen,
Well it is hard to tell without seeing them!  Unfortunitely the early cups
have no markings on the bottom while the 1961-65 flip-seat SO-34 &amp; 35 Westies
seem to have a manufacture marking on them.  Have been seeing the early small
cups going for $50.00-60.00 on E-bay.   Eric&amp;Barb
