 Hi Listees,
  Harry Houck recently had a shin-dig to welcome 
a '65 21 window to  his family. While there enjoying 
his hospitality and very tasty homebrew,  I learned 
from he and Karl (who is also from the list) the 
whereabouts of  a '62.......
 
    Right now my '62 has the rearend out of a '68 T3 
(I think that's  what the DPO said) ............

 To which Clara replied:
 
   Sounds like the rear was lowered by putting in a no reduction 
box trannys,  so you come either switch trannys, or pull your 
tranny, pull off the T3 axles,  flip the ring gear, and put on the 
reduction boxes and bus axles.   (and springplates too!)

In all fairness to Clara several other people have said just
about the same thing but I haven't focused in on what was
being said here.   

The crux of the biscuit is flipping the ring gear.  The next time
you've got the differential/ring gear out of your swingaxle take
a peek under the large diff carrier bearings.  You'll see a flat
spacer/shim.  That shim is what determines how the diff will
be centered from side to side in the trans case and that is
the pinion backlash adjustment.  Rarely are those two shims
the same thickness from side to side.  Here's where you 
better  burn some incense and say a prayer.  You don't know
if the DPO who did this actually removed the bearings and
also swapped the shims from side to side when they flipped
the ring gear over or did they just yank it out and stick it in
from the other side??  You don't want the backlash too tight
on a street vehicle because they'll let you know their there 
by howling and versa you don't want a 1/2&quot; freeplay before
the pinion gear bites on the top millimeter only of the ring gear.
Those are extremes but I've seen big differences between
the sides and I've seen small ones as well.  I *always* check
the backlash and diff bearing preload on my rebuilds because
with the age of the fleet you can pretty well be sure that you're
not the first to stick their grubby fingers inside the transaxle 
and you never know whats been done. (if even done correctly!)

Good luck!

PS //  Clara- I've been promised those sliders I need for your
trans by this week.  I'm all set up and ready to go with yours and
as soon as I get the parts I can install and deliver this one for
Nellie.  (I've got 3 others just like it to do as well !)
&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
