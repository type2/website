Subject: Seats - Repro Horsehair vs Foam

Have any of you ever used the Wolfsburg West repro &quot;horse hair&quot;
seat pads?  I bought a set, and am not sure they're all that
great.  They're hard as hell, and only surpassed in butt-bruising
discomfort by sitting on the bare seat pedestal.  Doe they loosen
up over time? (doubtful)  Is there some magic I was supposed to
do to them before installation?  I did multiple layers of various
foam densities (a local oldtimer taught me some upholstery tricks) 
on the '55, and those seats are quite comfy.
