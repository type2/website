Hi Brad,
Have you tried to gently tap on the bolt ends to get them to release the case 
halfs?  Also have you been WD-40 or Kroil oiling them and the bores they are 
in?

&lt;&lt;Do I need to have them drilled?&gt;&gt;
Only if you break them off!&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;If so, does putting a thread insert inside weaken the case or is there 
anything i should watch out for in this procedure? &gt;&gt;
Not as long as there is plenty of material around the area to be solid 
inserted.
