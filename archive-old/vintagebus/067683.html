&gt; Does anyone know of a web page with pics of type 2 engine tin vs type 1 
&gt; engine
&gt; tin?

Hi Jdd,
Except for the 1971 only bus front tin, some earlier changes in the rear tin 
hole/s for the preheat tube going to the bus aircleaner and the Bastard 40HP 
engine used in 1959-1/2 thru 1960, the bug and bus engine tin is the same 
year by year from 1950-71.  If your guess is correct about having a 1961 bug 
engine then it should fit perfectly if its tin is not screwed up.  We have 
seen 40HP rear tin cut and screwed onto 1500 and later engines and vice versa 
resulting in a lousey fit.  Definitely get the under tin and the thermostat 
back in there or loose preformance and longevity of the engine.  Otherwise in 
cold weather the rings and pistons will not heat up and expand properly in 
the cylinders causing them to allow alot of the fuel air mixture to pass by 
them into the engine case.  In turn the oil will fill with water vapor to 
rust steel/iron and raw fuel causing the oil to turn acidic quite quickly.  
Our aluminum oil strainers used to get a nasty pitted finish (Each pit the 
size of a pin head!) due to this aciditic build up even though we were 
changing oil about every two months every 3,000 miles at the time.  Since we 
started to use the thermostats on our engines the oil temp stays 160F and 
higher (instead of 140f or less) and the oil strainer never show any sign of 
corrsion even if we change the oil every six month on VWs we do not drive 
3,000 miles in that time.  If the oil strainers get pitted badly due to too 
cold of oil temp guess what that does to the rest of the engine!
