Subject: A VW shaped ray of light

It's 1:00 am, but to me it's still friday.  I have taught fifth grade for
ten years now, Tonight I went to the wake of a former student's father, who
passed away due to diabetes at the age of 47.  The first thing Mike(former
student 16 yrs young) said to me, was, &quot;Where is your hippie van? Did you
drive it here?&quot; (unfortunately I hadn't)  Then his brother said &quot; He got
another one, Hey Mr J, did you get that one goin' yet?&quot;  Both these kids
gave me the biggest waves when they would see me driving around town, and I
can only say that I can't wait to invite them both over to help me pull the
motor on the 65, and just get it goin again.
