Hey thanks again for the firewood,    It's okay to have a new 1776, I guess.  
but I have no apologies for driving my old 1600 SP.   I dont need no DP or 
dual carbs or dual circuit disc brakes (ya the hand brake is the second 
circuit).  I think  if someone has driven the old motor around since the 
fall, done the tuneup and several oil changes, and feels comfortable with 
having worked out the kinks, its good for a 1800 mile trip.  If it was bought 
in the fall,  but just sat, better get on it.   The way I see it, if you buy 
an old bus, you say okay, what works, what doesn't and you have a list of 
things to fix.

&lt;&lt; Clara, next time you're sitting around the campfire
 with me or others, remember all the firewodd I haul
 around the country is thanks to my 1776!  Plus I'm
 dragging my new singlewheel trailer.  (Everytime I do
 something to the busses to speed me up, I find
 something to slow me down.  Gee, that ought to be my
 motto.!)

 &gt; Ya, I noticed a lot of new 1776s too.
