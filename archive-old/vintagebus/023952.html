&gt; A excellent condition 1/2 length metal roof rack for buses...still has
&gt; reminents of the VW dealership part number tag still on it.. I would
&gt; like to get $200 for it....any shipping costs are extra.

just thought i'd make some comments on this type of rack. i have this exact rack
on my '60 westy. mine still has the blue tag and the part number is ZVW153202. and
yep, it fits the metal hatch top campers! just barely. it's not as cool looking as
the wood slat racks but it fits more and is obviously more durable. oh, and an
upright bass fits perfectly up there :-)

hope this helps someone,

tony
