Subject: Re: 67 big nut trans

Matt &amp; Katie (my59kombi_at_aol_dot_com) were the 1st to email back on the 67
trans and I will
deliver to them at Jerome. It will be reserved for them untill Sun
at noon and if they or a rep don't pick it up, it will be sold. 
It sounds like it is going to a good home.
