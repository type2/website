One other thing to think about, most cities don't actually patrol for
such things but rather respond to a call from a neighbor.

Subject: [VB] City on my butt!


   Well, it finally happened... the City of Stillwater (Oklahoma) is on
my ass about having my bus sitting in my driveway without an engine and
a tarp over it. As I do not have a double garage and I keep my Harley in
the rest of the garage along with my work shop area, washer/dryer,
bicycles and many years accumulation, I do not have any space to put the
bus, except in the driveway. Seems they consider it a &quot;junk motor
vehicle&quot;
   After reading the *complete* statute that I supposedly &quot;violated&quot;
(funny how they only state the parts of the statute that they feel
appropriate!), I found that it states: &quot;This statute does not apply...to
a vehicle being restored or repaired when reasonable progress is being
made&quot;, so I am going to fight city hall on the fact that I am restoring
and repairing this vehicle!
   Wish me luck...more to come!
