Don't cry Everett, I live to read yours and Thom's little comments.  I no longer need the scan as I have used another image for the article.  And if it makes you feel any better, it was for an article on keeping it 6V, so I was going to modify it to read 6V rather than 12.

I guess if it won't make my red light go out I don't need it.  The light is pretty anoying though.

&gt;Hope there is enough bus content in there to keep Everett and Thom from
making too many interesting comments about my request :)
&gt;
Wow, what a slam, I thought you were my friend. &lt;sniff&gt; &lt;sniff&gt; ;)

Anyway, guess I better make a smart-ass comment, how about:

&quot;Real Buses aren't 12v!&quot;
or
&quot;Installing the sticker won't make your red light go off.&quot;

If someone has a scan of the Bosch sticker for a &quot;round&quot; regulator (54-55
only?), I'd like to have that.

Bye,
Everett Barnes
