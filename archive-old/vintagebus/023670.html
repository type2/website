Subject: Re: SOTO Long Distance

Mr. Heard awarded the long distance award to Jeff Keller who drove his
58 Binz from Texas, appr. 1800 miles. Ellis should have got somekind of
award for towing a trailor all the way from Phoenix in 30 MPH head
winds. I think they said Everret had to push him up a couple hills with
his BD. Hope to see everyone in Jerome 2nd week of Sept, and Lake Havasu
Jan. 22,23,24 1999.
