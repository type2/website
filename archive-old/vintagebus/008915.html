Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

I have developed an opinion on truckers.  Most of them are selfish crybabies
and they take chances on the road like pulling out in front of me,
tail-gating, flashing lights, and driving like they truly rule the road.  I
deal with them daily with my job and get into verbal arguments with most of
them.  The nice truckers are in the minority IMHO.  And I'm technically a
trucker too as I drive a flatbed with my job so I'm basically denouncing
myself.  I think they are under stress and pressure to get their jobs done
but when I tell them how long it will be before they get unloaded, they
crybaby and call dispatch, which in turn calls my boss, and then I get my
ass chewed out for not hurrying up and kissing their ass.  So I definitely
have a thing against them.
