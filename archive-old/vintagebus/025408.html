Alright here we go, can someone translate this mcode for me that came
off my bus?


17    2

056

2412   454483   5107244

Ok there it is.     I would appreciate it if someone would break down
what each number means so I can explain to my friends what they mean
also.
I appreciate the help in this area...thanks.
Part 2 does anyone know if they put front disk brakes on busses. My 65
delux has disc brakes and it shocked the hell out of me. I thought I
would have some drums but they are discs. Is there any way of finding
out if they are original or are they from something else like a bug or
ghia?
One last thing.....does anyone have any good sites to look at some delux
buses. I really want to look at the interior also close up of dash.
Thanks in advance from everyone who responds....

P.S. Who is going to Bad Camberg? I am going.

Bryan
