rattle-canning. &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
Not to say that your expectations are totally incorrect, but we have seen 
plenty of NOS (New Old Stock, not Nasty Old Sh_at_#!) parts that have been 
stored as well as could be expected, and still have rust, chrome pits, and 
other age damage.  Some items like rubber and paint from 20-50 years ago only 
will look good for 6 months on a VW before aging rapidly.  Have even seen a 
NOS KG nose that had been tossed out in a field behind a VW dealership in a 
ditch and buried.  Then to be dug up by friends of ours a couple of years 
later to be sold to a fellow who was totally happy even due to the rust on it.
So please whenever you see the statement of NOS be sure to ask the condition 
and make you decision from that instead!   Eric&amp;Barb
