 I drive my '59 SC everyday to work and back and=20
sometimes even out of town, like say Jerome q;^D
 I have a problem though when you say, &quot;......rather=20
than just &quot;sunny days&quot;, living here in Lake Havasu,=20
that's everyday, I have no choice

&gt; gee! thanks for all the replies! haven't seen that=20
&gt; many on a topic for a while.
&gt;=20
&gt; i didn't want to come off as a &quot;he-man&quot; because my=20
&gt; bus is my only car, i was just curious as to how many of us actually =
drive them=20
&gt; regularly, rather than just on sunny days.=20
&gt;=20
&gt; i was also a little depressed about the whole &quot;bus=20
&gt; sightings&quot; topics, like it was some kind of miracle that a bus would =
actually be=20
&gt; on the road and not tucked away in a sealed, weather proof vacuum =
chamber. yes,=20
&gt; i know the &quot;bus sightings&quot; were more out of excitment, but if i did =
that every=20
&gt; time i saw a bus, i'd never be able to stop typing.
&gt;=20
&gt; well, keep drivin' them and enjoying them. and for=20
&gt; all those who avoid the bad weather, summer is coming!
&gt;=20
&gt; later,
