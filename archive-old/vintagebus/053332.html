Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Box connecting tubes?

I recommend using the original 'pod' sound dampers and the flexible metal 
tube with the fiberglass insulation round it.   At one point I had one of 
those bay window plastic tubes on my 61, and a road trip to the SF Area in 
December I broke a fan belt and thrashed the right side paper fresh air tube. 
 Replaced fan belt, bunched up fresh air tube so it blocked outlet as I 
hadn't another as a spare.  Ten minutes or less south on I-5 there was a 
horrible stink- the plastic tube between heater box and body was 
melting!!!!!!!!!!!!   So I pull over, crawl under and rip the POS off.  Drove 
to the next town- Grants Pass and got a replacement fresh air tube.   Now I 
use those not as pretty but sturdier plastic fresh air tubes from fan shroud 
(at least on right side) and only the stock heater box to body tubes.

 Warning, the plastic tubes are not plastic on the inside. The air temp
 coming out of the heater boxes is high enough to melt most plastics. I know,
 I've tried it. Use a flexible metal duct and wrap it with fiber-glass
 insulation.

 &gt; Since it is like 70 in Atlanta today I thought I would ask what a good
 &gt; alternative to the plastic heater box connectors are?
 &gt;
 &gt; I am sure Home Depot will have something I can piece together to work for
 &gt; now...  Any ideas?  In the past I think I have seen people use flexible
 &gt; exhaust pipe.  Kind of thinking a small dryer vent pipe will work if I can
 &gt; find a small one.
 &gt;
 &gt; I think I have a set that will fit but requires the engine to come out to
 &gt; fit in right... Not going to pull the engine for that, figure a new excuse
 &gt; to pull it will be coming sooner than later anyway :)
