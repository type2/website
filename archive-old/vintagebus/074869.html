Subject: 65 new transmission/coupler

From: Cal Grant &lt;cjay_at_well_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I hope you imaculately cleaned off all the oil from &gt;the surfaces before you applied the silicone

Haven't done the job yet (rained here this weekend)
but, yes, of course. I'm an anal retentive chef under the bus.

&gt;recommend the Ultra-Grey or Black, as it's high-temp &gt;rated and resists oil well -also sets up in 20 &gt;minutes, and it's a high density silicone
&gt;compound, not loose and rubbery.

I have permatex blue, because they sold in in a caulk-tube style. It's auto grade silicone with a high temp listing on it as well.  Does anyone have any BAD experiences with the blue?

&gt;You must be sure that your linkage can deal out the &gt;required leverage and force, until the tranny lubes &gt;up and break in. It will be somewhat difficult and &gt;stiff at the beginning

I'm currently going thru the entire linkage. New shift/stop plate, new front bushing, new front bushing carrier, the front coupler screw was missing!
Is this a VW part (same screw as the rear?)

&gt;should be alright. As Ronnie said, replace the &gt;coupler if it isn't stiff.
&gt;BE SURE that the two bolt holes are EXACTLY lined &gt;up - 1/16 th inch off is a entire shift from 1-2 to &gt;3-4. Find a coupler that 's made properly.
&gt;Don't settle for anything less. It won't work.

Damn! The new one I have is off by about 1/16&quot;.
How do you tell if my old one (bolt holes in line)
Is stiff enough to be good to reuse?  I don't want to send couplers back and forth in the mail for the rest of the year!

&gt;Make sure that the bottom stuff on the shifter up &gt;front works - the spring loaded pin, lots of grease &gt;down in that area.

My stuff was pretty dry and funky. I know that pin is supposed to stick into the slot in the front of the housing, but the spring seemed to be set up to push the pin back and away from there. Can some one give me the setup?

&gt;Be sure that the
&gt;reverse-locking plate is installed properly.

The flat stop side goes on the left and the curved side of the plate goes on the right, correct?

&gt;Use grease anywhere you feel you need to.

Now you're gettin' personal.

Billy
