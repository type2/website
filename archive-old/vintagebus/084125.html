Subject: Re: [VB] Horn/Gas Gauge?

 OK, this is concerning the NEW VDO gas gauge on my 63 Panel. I checked the power to the gauge (black wire on back of gauge connected to the + terminal) and I get 12.8V. I unplugged the brown wire on back of gauge and gauge needle falls to R as it does when the black wire is removed. I jumped the negative terminal with a spare wire with female ends and the gauge jumps to full. Then I took the brown wire off of brand new VDO sender and grounded the wire to bare metal on the body and gauge jumps to full. I then hooked up a NEW nickel plated PTFE coated milspec aircraft (brown) 18G wire from gauge to sender and gauge reads full. Now I know that the tank is not full but it does have about 7 or 8 gallons in it. Black ground wire on sender is NEW and is securely grounded to body. Gauge gets power to lights without either the black or brown wire hooked up. What to do?
