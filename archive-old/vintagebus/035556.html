&lt;&lt; We have friends who have installed 1966-67 type 1 back up lights and 
either 
 they have installed red pre-1958 bus center brake light repro lenses or 
 painted the insides of the clear backup lights lenses with yellow 
translucent 
 paint with good results.   &gt;&gt;

In Germany, many early VW owners have done this (My understanding it's to 
keep within current traffic laws).  When I show people my pictures of Bad 
Camberg they freak out because an otherwise pristine split window bug has 
62-67 taillights or &quot;auxilliary&quot; lights tacked on all over.
I have to explain these Germans do what they have to keep driving and 
enjoying their Vintage VW.
