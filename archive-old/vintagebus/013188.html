Can we ship him UPS?  He can't weigh that much.  I would do it but Springfield is not on the way to California.  Hey, isn't that were the Simpsons live?  What state is that in?

22 hours till I blast off for the Classic and then Bad Camberg.  Have we come up with a meeting place in BC yet?  I'm getting into Deuseldorf (badly misspelled I'm sure) on 9:50 PM on the 15th (wow, I lose a whole day getting there).  I just now looked at what time I land.  I usually do a better job at getting to places early enough to find a place to stay but not this time I guess.  Anyone else going to be getting in around that time?

Thanks,
Richard

Alright listees!  What can we do to get Erin to Springfield?  He has to
get down here -- there's a bridge with his name on it (Erin can tell you
that story).

Maybe we can set up set up a multi-point shuttle.  Someone can get him to
KC, then someone else can get him close to here and we can come get him.
He may have to stay here though, as I'm not sure we could get him back.

Help!

&gt; Well good grief - as soon as the plans were made, they got yoinked!  I got a
&gt; call from my buddy Dan tonight and he's not going to be able to go to the
&gt; Springfield show.  My plans were to ride with him down there, use his tent,
&gt; and campout at the KOA.  So right now my options are 1) drive down there by
&gt; myself  2)find a listee to go with  3)go to the Omaha show  4) don't go at
&gt; all and stay home and work on some projects.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now I'm leaning towards option 4 unless someone can convince me
&gt; otherwise. :-(
