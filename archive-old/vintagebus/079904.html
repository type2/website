Subject: bus dies a lot.

hey all,

   my beloved rita is having problems staying running.
it started today while we were goin to get her
registered, she would start to putter, then die when
we were stopped. then on our way back, she kept dying
when we slowed down. then when we got home, i let her
cool off for a while, then went out and tried to start
her again, she would start and run for like 2 seconds,
then die. i cant get her to run at idle unless my foot
is on the gas, and even then, she is wanting to die.
could this be a carb problem? its on a 1600 single
port, on a 67 bus. does anyone have a rebuild kit or
even a rebuilt carb i might could get for cheap? thanks.
