&gt; Our 1966 dealer accessory catalogue shows ZVW 171 101  Cigarette lighter for

With the talk about cigarette lighters, thought I'd add a comment. My
'65 Standard has one located just to the left of the ashtray. It's a 6
volt'er made in the USA with a screw on VW knob. At first I thought it
was a hack job, but after removing it, I'm beginning to think it was
probably a dealer installation. The hole for the socket was either
drilled real cleanly or the hole was punched. Then, someone took the
time to spray the hole with matching paint. Judging by the overall look,
it was done years ago. I was going to fill this hole in, but now I'm
beginning to doubt it.

So my question to those of you that have lighters installed, is where
are they placed? Any others to the left of the ashtray?

Thanks,

Doug Heitkamp
