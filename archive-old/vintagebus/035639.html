Amazingly the previous owner drove it like that. I feel like I saved the
car from the vandals.
When taking off the shocks I found them to be original VW. On closer
inspection I found a date stamped on them. They were produced in March
1967! These are the original shocks! Talk about a no-maintenance car.
I bought the car because I found it to be very original and untouched,
but this is too much.

yup.    Hey, put the old shocks in you wierd parts collection (doesn't
everyone have one?-  I kept the 4 part cam shaft I took out of a motor)
Does it have the original non split tranny boots?  if so I bet they are bad.
   I should replace the shocks on my 61 too.    hm.  I bet there is a lot
original on that bus.  hope they changed the fan belt  :)
