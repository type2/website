&gt; Read everything at http://www.wps_dot_com/LPG/index.html for lots of

&gt; info (this link is also available from the Library at type2_dot_com).
&gt; Basically it's a lot of technical notes on an LPG conversion on an
&gt; older (non-VW) station wagon.  One interesting note is that there is
&gt; a loop from the engine cooling system to heat the regulator so it
&gt; doesn't freeze; this will have to be done differently on an 
&gt; air-cooled
&gt; VW engine.

Right you are Matt, there is a different regulator 

To quote Tom Jemnings' booklet

&quot;Air-cooled engines would require a different converter/regulator
design.&quot;

Some air-cooled forklift and industrial small engines have this converter

but i don't know if they can be adjusted /adapted to work with a VW.
try these sites for info:

As far as your comments on fish carbs and Pseudoscience:

On my Fish links at:

http://sites_dot_netscape_dot_net/labmission/misclinks

my link states:

 &quot;The Fish Carburetor is an old after market design from the 50's. 
It can be

**adapted to run multiple fuels**.&quot;

Thus my interest in the Fish for is for alternate fuels.

Why alternate fuels? Govm't regulations favor the use of these
conversions 
for taxes and less restrictive smog regulations.

I am *not* trying to get 100MPG in my bus.

Aloha,

Ken
