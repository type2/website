Hi Marvin,
If no one can recommend a good shop down there have her towed to any old shop 
and have them charge and test the battery.  If it turns out good and the 
charging system is not doing it's job she can at least drive during the day 
on just battery power when not using lights.  We have done this twice both 
times over 600 miles!  If she is really nervous have her buy a new battery as 
a back up that she can install if she has the right sized wrench on hand.
