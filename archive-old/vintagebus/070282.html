Subject: RE: [VB] SoCal bus owners... favor please!!!

I have always used 92 from 76 in my VW's. It's been so long I forgot why I started! Though I will say that 76 has no MTBE, and I have never had a &quot;bad&quot; batch from them as I have at most other stations at at least one time or another. Sean 65 Westfalia
