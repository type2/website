What an A%$ Hole!!!

What the heck would he &quot;NEED&quot; the emblem for?  Maybe to trade it for some
killer weed which he &quot;NEEDS&quot;, but does not want to get a job and work for!
People really do not need much at all to live, commercial society creates
false needs that most people buy into because of fear, acceptance, or
glamour.  Want does not equal need.

Most all bus people I have run into in life have been respectable
individuals who are happy to help out one another and share a basic
comradery.  I guess there is a bad apple in every bushel, but hopefully this
is not a growing trend in our bus society circles....  Plus I do not want to
pay to rekey the locks on the bus so no one takes all my tools at VW events
;)

Way to go UJ!

Bus content:  I think the 34PICT air jet maybe what is wrong with my carb
right now, great tip!  If the weather holds up I would like to solder a
ground onto my early taillight assembly so it will work.
