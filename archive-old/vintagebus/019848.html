  I will be sure to check out these wheels Ronnie! My 
recently aquired DC has a wheel that was restored by 
Koch only a few years ago. It has a good sized crack 
where the spoke meets the &quot;rim&quot;. Also much of the raised 
detailing on the spokes are washed out, almost like a 
thick coat of primer and paint was globbed over 'em. 
Kinda dissapointing, after all the hype I have heard 
about that company in the rags. 
  Do you think this wheel can be redone and bring back 
that detail? Or should I swap this wheel out to Otto Von 
Bus, who is for sale with an unrestored wheel and start 
over?
