I'm using PPG CLV, single stage.  I'm shooting in my garage.  For a draft,
I'm using a combination of Taco Bell burritos and fans placed in the
foundation vents in the garage.  I'm not bothering to make a &quot;booth&quot; in the
garage.  I also have a small propane heater which I turn on to warm the
garage up after spraying.  I left it on all night, and this morning,
everything had dried nicely.  

I'm using a crappy harbor freight HVLP gun which seems to have too large of
a fluid tip on it.

Today will be more sanding and minor prep, then late this afternoon I will
shoot the cab area and engine compartment.  Tomorrow, I'll mask those areas
off and shoot the outside of the bus.

I bought a box of little screw-eye things, and have placed them in the
ceiling at strategic locations, then hung the parts to be painted from
them.  Works great for stuff where you need to get boths sides, like the
engine lid.  As a bonus, I hang 'em high, so I could still get the 911 in
last night.

&gt;What are you shooting.  Single or two stage?  Paint brand?  Inside? Outside?
&gt;Garage?  Booth?  If its in your garage, are you baging/tenting to make a
&gt;booth?  How are you venting/creating a draft?  Thanks for the info.
