Subject: Re: [VB] Rear shift rod coupler replacement

I was able in my 66 to replace it w/ all parts still installed. IIRC I
did have to disconnect the front end of the shift rod (under the front
of the bus) so that I had enough room. Then just loosened the set
screws, replace the coupling and install in reverse (do be sure to
include safety wire).
