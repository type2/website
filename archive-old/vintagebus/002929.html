Subject: oil bath intake flap
Date: Mon, 6 Mar 2000 18:40:44 -0800

Hi folks,

After reading through the owner's manual for my '67 Westy (thanks Thom -
excellent reference), the only thing really new to me was the paragraph on
the air cleaner intake flap:

&quot;The weighted flap in the air cleaner intake pipe must be free to move in
the winter and the cool seasons. If the average temperature is above 50° F
(10° C), the flap should be fixed open by jamming the lever under the ridge
on the intake pipe.&quot;

I've been driving this bus for almost 10 years, replaced the long block with
a rebuilt one 2 years ago, and never knew this. Before the bus I had a '73
Super Beetle (my first car - auto-stick...ugghhh!), then after I totaled it,
I put its engine in a '64 beetle body (wish I still had that!)....anyway,
paper filters until I got the bus in '91.

After reading this, I went ahead and &quot;jammed&quot; the flap under the ridge. I
haven't noticed any difference in performance, but if that's what VW said to
do, that's what I'll do. Is this a &quot;warm-it-up&quot; thing? If not &quot;jammed&quot;, the
thing opens as soon as you give it gas, so I assume it must be something
about keeping the air warmer while idling?

Anyway, after all the literature I've read on air-cooled VW's, I've never
heard of this. Not even from Muir. Then again, I don't have Bentley's guide
(yet).

I would bet there's a lot of people out there who don't know this, but
then - is it really important?
