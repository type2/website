&lt;&lt; will 195/75/r15s fit a stock bus rim? &gt;&gt;

Hi Nick,
Yes if they are the 1955-63 15&quot; bus rims.  Though you might have a hard or 
impossible time finding tires in that size that meet the minimum wieght 
rating of  well over 1500Lbs..  We just got a pair of 205/75R15s and could 
only find one maker (Trailfinder Radial AP) of this size that turned out to 
be rated (1598Lbs.) about 20Lbs. more than the factory stock bias ply tire 
wieght rating.   Eric&amp;Barb
