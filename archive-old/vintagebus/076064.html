&gt;what do you people use to remove the snap ring that holds the cam and

  THANK YOU...

as for the question: bigass snapring pliers from autozone. wherever 
you buy them, get the better-quality ones if you have a choice - this 
is not the time to cheap out and have a 'tooth' on the plier bend or 
break and fling the snapring at you.  if you get one with a nice 
selection of attachments you will find many maintenance jobs on your 
bus just got easier.
