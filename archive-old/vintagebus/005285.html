Josh's 69 bus is now owned by his brother.  He is taking very good care of
it.  I think he lives in Penn., maybe?  I actually met a guy at BNNTA #15
that met Jeremy at med school and had been helping him with the stars and
stripes.  I am going to get his phone # and see if he can join us in Turner
Falls for our memmorial camp-out.  Peace.

&gt; Thanks for posting the link Rex.  As I recall, the original page was
hosted
&gt; on a compuserve account.  A tear came to my eye when I read about Josh's
&gt; plans for the next big road trip - BBTB in Lake Havasu City, AZ. One of
&gt; these days I'll be able to make that trip in his honor even if I have to
fly
&gt; down there in order to do it.  Does anyone ever know what happened to the
&gt; Stars 'n' Stripes Westy?  I think it would rock to drive the bus to an
event
&gt; as kind of a Josh Rodger's memorial bus.  It would make sure that we
&gt; wouldn't forget him.
&gt;
&gt; I've always said that we should have a website to memorialize our fallen
&gt; comrades.  As time goes on, more and more will be added.  I remember Josh,
&gt; Scott Yuppa from the vintagvw listserv, Kirsten - the young girl they
found
&gt; at an Arkansas rest area brutally murdered.  I don't have enough webspace
&gt; that would allow a memorial like this but I'm sure that if few of us
worked
&gt; together, we could put together something no matter how simple it is.
&gt;
