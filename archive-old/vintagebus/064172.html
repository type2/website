Subject: RPM's

My son and I are trying to restore his 66 split window. It is in good
mechanical conditon.He drives it daily. When i drove the low (?) gear ratio
drove me nuts. No need for first gear really and I am not sure what we can do
it help it cruise at a lower RPM. What I have gleaned from lurking here is we
can
1) put on bigger tires                         simple,cheap, what size??
2) remove the reduction box (?)          drops the back down a few inches?
3) Have the tranny rebult                   sounds exspenive

What have y'all done? and what results have you gotten
Thanks
Tom
