Subject: pulled case saver ...this freaking sucks
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just got done assembling the short block 
put the cylinders and jugs on and started to torque the heads down 
when I realize that the appropiate torque of 23 ft #s is not happenig
the stud was already a 1/4 inch out of the stud.

guess I need a new case now 
to bad my first case has already been line bored
and I have matching bearings     dammmm
Any one know what to do when this happens ?????/
any one need a case that is line bored but needs a saver fixed ?
case has already been polished with a brass wheel to make it shine
I bet that It would make a great bonfire!!!!
