I don't think any of these repro safaris are perfect, some are better than
others but that is just a matter of your own personal experience. Everybody
selling these would say mine are the best! not like competition..... bla,
bla, bla.... that's why I asked for your opinion..... if I get them at
$326.00 as I'm bidding (I gave my secret proxy bid amount out - ouch!) I
shall be fine........ as long as these work for what I need. My bus is not a
daily driver (at least not yet) and will only be in use in summer....

Thanks guys,,,,,
BTW - if I don't get them though what is the company to go for??


&gt; Those are NOT ours.
