I have for sale or trade a 1965 13 window dlx walk-thru. Needs rust repair 
on floors and rockers. Drivers door has a dent and bondo on it. Has front 
bumper. Headliner intact and looking good.Dlx trim missing engine out and is 
in short block form right now. Bus was supposed to have newer brakes on it 
tires dont go flat and bus rolls very nicely. No seats...maybe able to 
include some though. Will include as much extra parts I can to sell the bus. 
Bus is located in Rockford, IL which is in the Northern part of the state of 
IL. Reason for selling I got it on a trade and I dont have time for this 
bus. I am also picking up a 66 bus in two or so weeks that is much more 
soild which is another reason for the selling of this bus. Has a clear 
Wisconsin title. I would like to get $500 for it. few other splits also for 
sale. Storage not a prob could store as long as needed within reason. If you 
could please e-mail me at:

1965bus_at_volkswagenhomebrew_dot_com

That would be great thanks
