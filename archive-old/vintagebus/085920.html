&gt; Howdy all. Had an uprising of demand on the
&gt; Samba, so I'm printing up a
&gt; midseason run, hopefully in time for Christmas,
&gt; of the fireman's edition
&gt; of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts.

Love that shirt.  I can vouch for Richard's
quality standards.  My last one was purchased at
Everybus 01 and still looks good after being worn
alot.  

My bus also prefers that I wear it while doing
any repairs.
