 Remove what's there.  Then remember to re-grease them per the
 recommended intervals, which will keep them from getting exposed to
 air.  Can't remember the interval right off, but it's something like
 every 1500 or 3000 miles - easiest to do it as part of a tune-up, when
 you should be hitting all the lube points anyway.

1200 miles.   according to the book that came new with a 60 double door panel 
sold in portland, OR.   yes sirs and ma'ams, every 1200 miles you should lube 
all you hinges.   :)

this said panel van had evidently not kept up with maintenance in decades, 
and the hinges were showiung definate signs of infrequent lubrication.  Don't 
let this happen to you!!!!!
