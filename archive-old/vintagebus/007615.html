CAMPGROUND COMMENT AND EVALUATION CARD

PLEASE EVALUATE OR COMMENT ABOUT YOUR CAMPING EXPERIENCE AT LAKE POWHATAN
CAMPGROUND.

THIS CAMPGROUND IS MANAGED BY THE CRADLE OF FORESTRY IN AMERICA INTERPRETIVE
ASSOCIATION UNDER A CONCESSION ARRANGEMENT WITH THE US FOREST SERVICE.  WE
WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS TO HELP US IMPROVE THE CAMPING EXPERIENCE AND
OUR MANAGEMENT OF THE CAMPGROUND.

HOW WOULD YOU RATE YOUR CAMPING EXPERIENCE (DO NOT RATE THE WEATHER)?

Comments:

Overall our camping experience was wonderful, with the exception of the
Rangers and Hosts.


HOW WERE YOU TREATED BY THE HOSTS AND STAFF?

Comments:

The Rangers and Staff (Hosts) were horribly behaved.

We were part of an informal gathering of people, good old fashioned
taxpaying citizens, who are primarily campers and secondarily VW Campervan
Enthusiasts.

We were given a RUDE reception at the gate when we checked in for our
RESERVED and PREPAID site.

Our experience at the check in was not exclusive. Most of the Campers in our
group were greeted likewise. A few of the Campers did not feel offended by
the Rangers at the gate.

It is very unpleasant and not even remotely hospitable to greet Campers as
if they are intruding or somehow incovieniencing the Rangers by arriving to
CAMP in a CAMPGROUND.Their attitude was plain unbeliveable. I felt like just
leaving, but even though they had upset me I wanted to see my friends.
Besides, when you reserve a site on the webpage, they charge you for the
site in advance, non-refundable, so I was not about to let these ill
mannered people waste my money.

IT GOT WORSE!

The Rangers were constantly patrolling the Campsites of everyone in a
Volkswagen Camper. Their favorite pet peeve was to force people to relocate
their vehicles. It is plainly posted that there is a two vehicle limit to
any particular campsite, and this rule was vigorously and constantly
enforced. I do certianly understand now the importance of adherence to this
rule, but its logic even now escapes me. This rule was used exclusively as a
tool of harassment by the Ranger/s.

The Ranger/s was also constantly approaching the campsites, uninvited, and
threatning several Campers with a &quot;FIFTY DOLLAR FINE&quot; for non-specific and
even better non existent rule infractions.

THEN IT GOT DARK.

The ranger/s approached several campsites, one specifically several times
under cover of the night and the woods. Then when he was heard, he would
turn on his flashlight and walk away. This is BIZZARRE behavior, and
unacceptable from any perspective.

The next morning, Saturday June 17, The rangers resumed their harassment,
abeit with slightly less vigor. By Sunday morning, they seemed to have
calmed down. We, collectively as a group, and myself individually, did not
change or modify our camping behavior over the entire weekend. Actually, to
placate the Rangers we were forced into a policy of appeasment for the
duration of the Weekend.

My wife and I camp on average twice a month, year round. We have camped as a
couple and with groups all over the Southeast. I know we understand how to
camp responsibly. In fact all of the campers in our group pride themselves
on being responsible campers.

Nearly all of the campers in our group had prepaid reservations. We were not
by any strech of the imagination a Horde.


HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE CONDITION OF THE FACULTIES (BATHROOMS, CAMPSITE,BEACH
AREA, ETC)?
