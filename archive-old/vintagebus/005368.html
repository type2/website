&gt;So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and
&gt;pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.
&gt;
I don't know what to tell you, it doesn't bother me if I annoy other
drivers.  What does bother me is at freeway on-ramps when people either fly
by me on the shoulder just to get ahead or can't even get up enough speed
coming onto the freeway to match me.  Jeez, I'm only going 50...

I almost rear-ended someone the other day, I was in the slow lane only going
40 in a 40 mph zone (I must be insane!), a guy whipped in front of me then
slammed on his brakes and came to a complete stop because a cop car was
traveling the other way with it's lights on.  I quickly whipped around him
in the emergency lane, barely averting a serious accident.  I kept going, at
that time traveling about 15 mph, while I came to my senses.  He then
decided he didn't really need to stop and whipped around me again just to
continue on at 50 in the slow lane.

I feel sorry for them, stuck in their little cars, while I ride in style.

Later,
