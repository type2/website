Subject: Re: [VB] Fwd: [T2] Guy broken down

&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Dave Luppy are on their way.
&gt;They were towed to a second garage, one
&gt;that actually works on Bolts, and had the
&gt;broken halfshaft removed and brought it to
&gt;me for examination. We found the new inner cv
&gt;had come apart, and the cage was cracked
&gt;but not broken. The problem was the cv joint
&gt;had virtually no articulation, like as if it were
&gt;incorrectly assembled, but the fact is it is a
&gt;poor quality aftermarket part. it had also slightly
&gt;damaged the end of the shaft when the balls
&gt;dropped out, and the inner race was damaged.
&gt;We rejected the failed part and he is replacing
&gt;both halfshafts with good used, cleaned, greased,
&gt;original Lobro halfshafts, and should be good for
&gt;another million miles.He will be installing them
&gt;himself tomorrow morning.
&gt;Mrs. Luppy has examined her prenuptial agreement
&gt;and acknowledges that the party of the first part has
&gt;used up a significant portion of allowable roadside
&gt;repair time, but took the afternoon in stride, and was
&gt;quite interested in discussions of project vehicles and
&gt;technical ramblings.
&gt;They are heading for St. Louis and Seattle.
&gt;Happy Honeymoon, Dave and Dasha.
