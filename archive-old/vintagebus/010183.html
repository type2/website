WOW! GREAT! YEAH BABY! YEEHAW!  AWESOME! COOL!  I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

Bustoberfest 2000 was a huge hit.  Everyone that came to it had a great time
and we all made new friends or reinforced current friendships.

For a long time now, Rob Laffon and his son Justin, Terry Wolfe (all from
Omaha) have been wanting to do some campouts but the problem was that in
previous years, Terry didn't have a bus and then later had a &quot;most in need
of restoration&quot; project, Rob had a Westy with an inner craving for a split,
and I had a project bus that wasn't roadworthy.

This summer, things came together with Terry Wolfe's bus completed enough to
road trip in, my bus became road worthy, and Rob - not being able to stand
it any longer - bought a sweet 66 single cab.

During our travels this year, Rob got the hankering for a single or double
cab due to the influence of Dan Kinsey in KCMO (now in Florida) because of
crusing in his 58 Binz.  I went to Dan's 3 times this year and the Binz is
really a bus to behold - fun to cruise in with the safaris open.  After all
that cruising, one almost began to wonder if the Red Elvises' music actually
was a factory option.   :-)

During our June trip to the Mo-Kan show, word was mentioned to Pink Newell
and Ric Taylor (from KCMO and Topeka respectively) about having an OVWC/KC
Kombis sponsored event involving a campout.  It made the most sense to
locate a place somehwere in  between the 2 areas.  As it was, the Kansas
contingent had about an hour's more worth of driving compared to the
Nebraska contingent.  Nevertheless, sometime back in September, Pink and Ric
scouted out Indian Cave State Park on their own and came to the conclusion
that this was a great spot to hold the event at.   A joint scouting effort
between Rob, Terry, and I ensued a couple weeks later and by October 1st, we
had said, &quot;This is it.&quot;  http://home.ispi_dot_net/bie/elassley/icsp/index.htm

As the word went out, I put a little effort into making a website to
announce the event http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/icsp/bustoberfest.html
and made
