There is a pretty nice 21 window with safaris that somoeone
drives around my town. I'ts parked in the same place everyday.
Even the rainy ones. I have to laugh when I see those big sheets
of plastic he has under his safaris on the rainy days. Don't know if 
they are og or not. I guess it's worth all the trouble but I can't emagine
why. I never see him driving with them open.
