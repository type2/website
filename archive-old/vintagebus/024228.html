One thing that I noticed in Puebla was the engine assembly line... all
of the complete VW engines were hanging in the air, each held by a clamp
that fit on the engine tin, of all places... that roughly 4&quot; X 2&quot;
indentation on the top/middle of the fan shroud. ...just a simple clamp
that held it by compressing the front and back of the shroud, with
approximately the same area on the compressing plates as the indentation
itself.
	Needless to say, I didn't get under any of them. 
	A thumbs-down on the cherry-picker from me, too...

&gt; him.
