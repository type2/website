&lt;&lt; now a tranny question!! &quot;Pearl&quot;
 has a 3.88 rancho--the two side plates that hold the axle boots LEAK!!
 could be dried up gaskets because truck was not driven much--do not feel
 like pulling tranny for just a pair of gaskets--so can i CHEAT and slit
 the gaskets to fit onto the tranny and seal with sillycone or some other
 sealer?? has anyone tried this short-cut?? results?? or ?? pull tranny
 and do it right?? talked to a person who slit 3 gaskets per side,
 staggered the slits and used a sealer and never leaked again!! i'm open
 to your opinions and or ideas--thanks &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Pull everything out, the paper gaskets are what set the play in there and if
you do not get the right amount of paper gaskets in there your axles will
bind.   Eric &amp; Barb
