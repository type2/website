hello again gerald.

here's my $.02 worth
I use gaskacinch on the paper gaskets that come with your head change kit
there is a procedure in John Muir's idiot book for laping in the heads to
cylinders
i don't know if this would work at the opposite end.
the point i'm trying to make here is that the case surface is supposed to
be machined parallel to your crank's centerline and head mating surface.
if your studs are pulled out or your case is deformed there might be
problems down the road
because the #3 cylinder (usually the first one to go) is giving you
problems, you might want to re torque your heads and keep an eye on your
valve clearance too.
Before you adjust you valves find what gap was there prior to your
adjustment.
 keep a history of it in a note book each time you adjust your valves.
this way you know if your valves are stretching or your rocker shaft is
loose or your cylinders are coming  loose and you act  accordingly.
there's a loaf bus running around Oahu that i put such an engine in.
 but i did it for free with junk parts (from a buddy etc. an my stash)
and i have run such engines in my VW's  but they are nothing more than
stop gaps between breakdowns and with the understanding that as soon as
the cash comes the bus gets a good motor not a new surfboard for our zero
er, hero.

aloha
