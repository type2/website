Subject: Re: [VB] windshield leak

Hi Mike,
Sounds like you need to cut the rubber and pull out the glass.  Then go over 
the windshield frames to make sure they are rust free and painted.  We put tar 
in the rubber groove the glass seats into and coat the frames where the 
rubber goes into.  It is the only sealant we have found that both lubricates the 
rubber to slide in the frame and repels rust.  Check out section A-14, page 11 
of the 1963-67 Workshop Manual VW Transporter for more info on windshield 
installation.
