Not to wear out this subject - hopefully this is another tangent on the same
theme - that vw wrecking yard single cab I have a question about.  I was told
that in California wrecking yards usually don't have used car dealer's
licenses, therefore can't sell used cars.  Once the car is taken to the yard,
it doesn't come out.  Isn't there a loophole there?  Can't you buy the body as
a &quot;part&quot;?  Or can't it be sold as a piece of scrap?  As far as I know you
don't have to have a scrap license to buy scrap.  If there is, wouldn't the
first option work?  Isn't there any other loopholes/options that the wrecking
yard owner/attendent would go along with that I haven't thought of?

As far as title, all you would need is a bill of sale for something that old
and you can get it titled in Georgia.  Other states are the same way.

Just a thought.
