Subject: Re: [VB] flame from listee

Dont worry, I already forwarded the email to State
Farm.  I have never been one to be trifled with.  Just
ask my first wife.  :-)

I have mellowed out while drinking a martini and have
been thinking that I have been a little hard on the
hippies today.  I will have to tell you some day how I
got on the anti-hippy crusade but that is for another
day.  I have been flamed enough today.  i really didnt
think that many still existed.  Oh Well.  Schlaf gut,
VW Kommeraden!

&gt; I'd love to hear what state farm thinks about their
&gt; employees utilizing the
&gt; email in such manners.
&gt; 
&gt; I have always refused to put bumper stickers on my
&gt; vehicles, especially my
&gt; double cab.  Not even a single OCTO stickers, though
&gt; I've been very tempted.
&gt; 
&gt; remember, it's the second amemdment that protects
&gt; the first.

&gt; &gt; Read below...  some loser just flamed me.  I must
&gt; &gt; admit, as a rather fair complected guy i have
&gt; never
&gt; &gt; been called a coon before.  Too bad this dumbass
&gt; used
&gt; &gt; his work email address.  Hehehe.
