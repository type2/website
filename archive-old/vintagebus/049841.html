&gt;&gt; I'm wondering what color front seat upholstery my '66 Westy should have.
&gt;&gt; I'm guessing that it came with grey salt &amp; pepper, but the seats were
&gt;&gt; recovered by the PO in black aftermarket basketweave.  Anyone know for sure?
&gt;
&gt;As far as I can find it was called &quot;mesh grey&quot; #83.


Can I find out the original upholstery from the ID plate behind the seat???
