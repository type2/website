Hi Pete,
Hmm, what did #4 compression test show?  Where is the pitting/small bang 
marks?  In the head, the top of the piston or both?

 Well, anyway my question is I did this with the engine still in the car and 
I am wondering what kind of problems I would have if I just did the head, 
cylinders, and pistons on this side only.  The other side both #1 and #2 have 
120lbs each.&gt;&gt;
         Best to just remove the engine to do it right.  Then if #4 cylinder 
had as high compression as #1&amp;2 it probably is fine.  If not then take off #4 
cylinder and make and inspection of the piston and rings.  If all looks good 
then replace cylinder and install new head.  We keep hearing that a fellow in 
Techapi (SP?) Cal does a head rebuild that does not drop valve seats.  We 
really advise against replacing the P&amp;Cs on only one side.  This would most 
likely unbalance the motor due to new better sealing VS old parts on each 
side.

&lt;&lt; I know this is not  a Vintage bus but what the hell i own two of them   &gt;&gt;
Well they are another form of engine that can be installed in the earlier bus 
and are very simular over all.  So we are posting this to the list.
