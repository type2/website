 I have a rock signed by Uncle Jerry  Jess and a bunch of other Phoenix
area bus crazies, John Stanton, Bobb and Allen, Kent Thorpe..  I won it
at a VW song contest at the phoenix show in 96...( to the tune of row
row row your boat) &quot;push push push your bus, gently up the hill,
downshift downshift into third, or blow your motor will...&quot;

Pmail me for the whole set o lyrics if you are realy bored.
