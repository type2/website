...Hello All,
When I take my 66' kombi on the highway for any longer than 5-10 minutes,
when I slow down, My oil sender light flickers on.  If I give it gust the
slightest rev, the light immediatly goes out, but will return until I get
moving again.  Any thoughts??? I have an 1835cc motor with only about 4000
miles on it.  I try to keep my speed under 65 w/ the reduction gears, as I
am aware of  the bad highway gearing and all.  The timing is all correct,
Bosch 009.  I was told that the compression is high, I don't know the
numbers, But I'm still getting some detonation under load.  All in all, the
bus runs great, and wants to go fast.  I'm planing a beetle tranny swap end
of July, beginning of August, But want some peace of mind.  Any thoughts
greatly appreciated.
