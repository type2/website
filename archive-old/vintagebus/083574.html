Subject: horn wire, carb woes, I'm back

Howdy, strangers,

I'm back (&quot;You were gone, Joe?&quot;) -- been unsubbed since before a trip 
to Europe last March and just took a while to get back on board.  
Busted the horn wire in my 65 splitty and researched the vintagebus 
archives to figure out how it's routed, found a cool post by Clara 
describing it and realized I missed you guys.

A couple of weeks ago my bus started bogging really badly coming off 
the line (stock 1600SP).  Suspected the accel pump and swore I had it 
cleared up but it didn't fix it; swapped carb off my 65 vert (so nice 
having two cars with same engine!) and it went away.  So I ordered a 
replacement carb.

While waiting for that, I started noticing what seemed like a 
high-speed miss.  Stupid old cars, I'm gonna buy me an Element.  Ran 
fine at idle, if fast.  Goes away after it's been running a little 
while.  Suspected choke (Brits don't call 'em stranglers for nothing) 
and sho nuff the butterfly has been sticking open.  So I'll fix that 
when I take the carb off to replace it with the new one, before I put 
the old carb back on the b**tle.  I will then have a couple of stock 
carbs in various states of disarray; maybe I'll learn how to rebush 
them etc.

I've become a shutterbug again, and a Flickr addict, so I'll share a 
few photosets of interest -

Tent pages are still getting hits, and still way overdue for an 
overhaul.

Cheers,
