As far as I have heard, Goodguys will not have any VW shows this year.  There
is nothing listed on their website, nor has anything been advertised in the
national magazines.
I used to love going to the Bug Bash in Pleasanton back in the late 80's.  Oh
well, if anyone knows anything different let me know.
