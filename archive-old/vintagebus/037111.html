&lt;&lt;   Hi every body, I have a ´73 bug with a 2007 c.c. engine and it works very
good. That I want is put the same engine into my ´65 bus but I´m afraid
because I think it will cause over heating. If some one have something like
this, tell me the way that the engine works without problems. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Is that a type 1 or 4 engine?  Either will work, but to really get to know if
it is working fine it would be best to first install oil pressure, oil temp,
maybe a head temp, and buy, borrow, or beg a tachomter for a 15 minute drive
to see where the RPMs are in the bus's four forward gears at what MPH.  Eric &amp;
