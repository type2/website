Subject: Powdercoating colors?

I didn't see a conclusing come of Clara's adventure with powdercoating, so I 
wanted to put the question out on the table directly. Please flame away if 
this is obvious in the archives, but I checked and found little relavent 
content.

My question relates to the factory colors of the wheels and of the roof 
racks. From my research, I am only able to garner that the color most often 
used for roof racks is &quot;Mercedes Silver&quot; from DuPont. Whether that is 
correct has yet to be validated. The specific wheel color still eludes me.

I am able to draw from the palettes of DuPont, Tiger, Morton and Cardinal 
paints. My local shop has done quite a bit of work with the first two, but I 
wanted to know if any of you have tried colors from any of these companies 
and found them to be close enough to stock that a difference cannot be 
easily seen. I have been invited to come down and &quot;pick one out&quot;, but I fear 
that my eye is not close enough for restoration work. I'm not trying to be a 
N*zi here, but don't want them to be so far off that it's obviously wrong...

Any input is greatly appreciated,

~Rich Barker
