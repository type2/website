Subject: My DC is too loud???

I got pulled over today for the DC being too loud by the local PD.
I was heading south of a local street and as I turned right, I noticed a
cop looking at me real close as I went by.  He was facing the opposite
direction and in the left turn lane
A few side streets later to get around the detour, I was back on my
southbound street.
I checked my rearview mirror and saw the patrol car coming up on me real
quick w/lights on.

I knew right away due to his speed and being behind me, that I was his
object.

I didn't want to be the latest SoCal TV pursuit, so I pulled right over.

He asked for the copy of the registration - says my plate returned &quot;not
on file&quot;.
I gave him a copy and told him that he needed to run it as a ham plate.
- &quot;oh&quot;
then he asked for a copy of my insurance.
then I got, &quot;your engine is too loud&quot;
I asked for permission to get out and show him what I'd done, explained
everything, etc. (Type IV motor, dual exhausts, etc)

&quot;Nope, too loud&quot;
I said, &quot;that's strange, I volunteer for xxPD (next door city), and in
all that
time, no one's ever said anything about it&quot;
he looked at me hard, &quot;you volunteer for the PD?&quot;
me: &quot;yes....&quot;
him: &quot;hmmm...&quot;   thinking thinking thinking
he mumbled something like &quot;i'm not surprised they didn't say anything&quot;
(who knows what he meant by that)

Then I got a lecture about being lucky that the truck is older than 65
and smog equipment not required, how people between 65 and 74 think they

can strip off all the smog equipment, I need to take it to a muffler
shop to quiet it down.
finished with, &quot;I'm not going to cite you, but get it fixed.&quot;

I have actually had a cop pull along side of me (not this city) and
comment on
the truck and ask what year it was and if I wanted to sell it. nod,
smile and drive off.

I guess I'll be paying a visit to a muffler shop soon,

Scott
