In a message dated 98-08-29 01:28:23 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I had finally fished out the tap from the far forward hole in the right
 reduction box and used but stripped my last bolt trying to use the threads.
 unable to find the grade 8 bolt, I used a 3 lined silver bolt that was a bit
 too long. I threw 3 washers and a wave washer on there and snugged it up
 tight. The back middle bolt is also somewhat stripped anyway I found the
right
 bolts in RI and they arrived the day I took it 600 miles north with the newly
 arrived bolts in a baggie in case. When I got up there I jacked it up and got
 under with the breaker bar on the plug socket and checked em. I could turn
the
 weak one and the stripped one a half turn each. Drove it back home without
 incident. now I'm contemplating the two new bolts and the washer methods so I
 can check the torque. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Time to check out Time-Sert on the WWW for solid insert kits for your
reduction gear boxes.   Eric &amp; Barb
