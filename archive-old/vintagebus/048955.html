I picked up some of Derek Greg's repop bows at Pomona on Sunday.  Got them home and installed yesterday.  All in all it was smooth sailin'.  Derek told me that he's still trying to figure out how to keep the bow caps from tweaking at the ends when installed.  What happens is the cap ends &quot;bow&quot; out toward the front or the rear of the bus when installed, depending on if it';s the front cap or the rear cap.  I've noticed a bit of this with the original set I have, but his are a little more pronounced.  No big deal tho, especially when the canvas is on, you can't even tell.

If anyone has been considering whether or not to buy a set, my opinion is that he does a VERY nice job for a VERY fair price.  Everything lined up, the workmanship was outstanding.  They could almost pass as an original set, except for the fact that they look so nice.

One trick when installing the wood rails, whcih are extra if you buy them from Derek.  I made my own since wood is so much easier to work with than metal. Don't tighten any of the screws that hold the cap and slats to the bows until you have them all in.  The two ends slats are a friggin' bi*ch to get to line up to get the screw through.  I would maybe suggest doing the two ends slats first and then the center four.  I say maybe since I haven't tried it this way and it might be more difficult.  I guess play around with it.

BTW, Derek's (DG Enterprises) phone number is (805)945-5622.
