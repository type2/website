Subject: Got 40 HP Flywheel to trade anyone?


Thanks to many of you here on the list, I have learned that the 40 HP engine i picked up to replace the destroyed 1500 engine in the '64, cannot use the same flywheel from the 1500.  I guess I should have done my research BEFORE I picked up the 40 HP motor (insert string of curse words here!!) Anyway the 40 HP has no flywheel, and I really want this to be a totally FREE bus when I'm finished (I got both the bus and the new engine through barter deals). So anyone got an old 40 hp flywheel cluttering up your garage that you would like to trade for something you need.  I have a ton of baywindow parts including: wiper motor assembly, lots of glass, Westy back hatch screen, couple of straight front doors and a back hatch, aluminum sink basin, and a lot of other odds &amp; ends.  I also have some split window camper curtain rods. LET'S MAKE A DEAL!!


Peace, John Baker
