&lt;&lt; &gt; Hydralic press
 &gt; Engine case boring bar
 &gt; Head rebuild tools and fixtures.
 &gt; Crankshaft pulley puller.
  These should only be needed for a rebuild, correct?&gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Well the pulley puller is handy if you want to remove the lower pulley and/or 
work on or replace the pump.  Otherwise yes, for the most part.  the hydralic 
press is so usefull for so many other parts of the VWs!
 
 &gt; Ring compressor
 &gt;  0-6&quot; dial caliper.
 &gt; Dial indicator.
  These I knew I needed.... suggestions for places to buy these? What kind
 of scale/throw do I need on the dial indicator?&gt;&gt;
Any machinist tool supplier will do.  Just do not get the cheapest model!  
Either the small .030&quot; throw or the bigger type.  You need to be able to 
measure only 0-.020&quot;.  Yes it is best to get a three piece ring compressor or 
you have to install both the cylinder and piston at the same time to prevent 
not being able to remove the circular type of ring compressors.
 
 &gt; Tool to install flywheel seal
 &gt; Spring retainers to hold tappets in place while you put the case halfs 
together.
 &gt; Adjustable pushrod to figure the length of push rods needed for proper 
rocker/valve stem geometery.
 &gt; Pexiglass fixture and a way to measure liquid ccs to cc the head chambers.&lt;
&lt;&lt;These I hadn't thought of.... once again, where is the best place to pick
 these up?&gt;&gt;
 Best is always the swap meets for a song, but if time is of the essense then 
many of the VW shops and mail order catalogs have these for sale.  Except for 
the last mentioned tools you need to make your own pexiglass fixture and get 
a large 50+cc syringe for the measurement.  

 &gt; Flywheel lock.
  Should I buy something, or just build one out of angle iron?&gt;&gt;
Just buy one they only cost ten or less bucks and will then fit both 12 or 6 
volt flywheels perfectly to prevent damaging them.
 
 &gt; Torque wrench.
 &gt; Balance beam, or scale.
  Hey... I already have these... is a 0-100ft lb. torque wrench sufficient? &gt;&gt;
It is OK for all but the flywheel gland bolt which need 215 Ft Lbs.  So 
either you can figure ourt by how much you wiegh and how far out on the 
breaker bar you need to stand on it without and jumping or buy a bigger 
torque wrench or buy a adapter piece for your present torque wrench.
Also do yourself a big favor and buy a L-shaped Proto 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar 
and sockets.  The Sears Craftsman 3/4&quot; drive breaker bars are junk!  We have 
twisted and broken plenty of the Sears with only a three foot cheater bar and 
not been able to even bend our Proto bar even with an eight foot long cheater 
bar on it.
