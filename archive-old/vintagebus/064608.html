&gt; looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
&gt; two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in
&gt; germany many years ago when 25/36hp was what there was) says to oil the p's
&gt; and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years experience
&gt; building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work 
&gt; has
&gt; a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your 
&gt; motor
&gt; and that they are best left dry. Opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; 
I have heard some oil additives can cause problems if used during the brake 
in period. But I would use oil myself, maybe some kind of two stroke oil 
would be better? JMHO Mel
