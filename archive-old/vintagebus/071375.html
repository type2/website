Matt, List,

What Matt has brought up regarding checking those nuts is no joke!

During this year's Shasta Trip preparations, I discovered a tie rod nut that
was loose...I was able to remove it completely by hand...and the tie rod
pushed up with the slightest of effort.  Really scary if you ask me.  For
some reason, the castellated nut was still on an aftermarket tie
rod....stupid me for not noticing that years ago!

Lucky me for not being in a ditch with precious VW wrapped around me!

I always check my nuts after that!

As far as having two people in the chase car...I can't argue with that!
Safety first!

I'll be doing lots of checking things tomorrow...a full VW day, devoted to
my trusty, and somewhat rusty, doublecab.  (today I had to install a
cooktop).

I'll report my findings, and thanks, all, for your help!

Gene
