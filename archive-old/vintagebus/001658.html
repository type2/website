Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen Bus...San Diego

I'm sorry, too, that people steal things...and when it's someone's love and
joy that is violated, well, it makes me MAD!

So, what can we do about it?  Are there ways to make it more difficult to
steal our buses?  Besides alarms, there are hidden engine &quot;kill&quot; switches,
brake line locks, and of course, MY great idea:  electrified body that is
insulated from the ground by the tires...until someone touches it without
permission, that is.  An onboard tesla coil?  Well ok, my idea still has a
few kinks...like someone gets shocked, then gets a bit ticked off, and
starts in with a club or gloves....

Really...I am very concerned about this!  How will I leave my bus by the
side of the road, or in a desolated parking lot, hundreds of miles from
home, while I follow a hiking trail, or whatever...?

Sorry, I'm babbling.

Gene
