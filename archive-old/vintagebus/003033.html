That overhead vent is forced air.  The faster you drive, the harder it pumps
air in.  When you hear people talk about &quot;ambulance fans&quot; they are referring
to factory fans that were installed in the air box to pump air through while
you were at a standstill but they hardly put out any air at all. I'm sure
someone could improve on the design with some nice small turbine fans but
the stock output of them is so pathetic, it's hard to justify the $300 -
$400 price tag they go for.
