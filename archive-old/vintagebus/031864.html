I do not have any Gizmo's in the bus, just the Tach. It is wired in per VDO
instructions useing there sheilded wire etc.Idle is at 800 rpm cold and goes
up to 1000 when warmed up. I contribute that to the Kadrons and there
linkage. I do have hard driving habits but didn't know what they were till
now and do contribute the excessive rpm's to the tranny gearing and the
engine in the bus,but it works and has gotten me 1000's of miles, all fully
loaded down. If all was stock I wouldn't get near what I do. I know driving
the old 40 hp side loader that with the pedal to the metal I'd be lucky to
reach 4000 rpm winding it out going downhill.

&gt;I finally installed the tach in my bus, VDO Street Eliminator, to see how
my
&gt;driving habits were and to see what RPM's I usually run/drive at. The
&gt;results were a lot different then I expected. So here we go.
&gt;
&gt;Using my regular driving habit I found that I run the engine up to 4900 rpm
&gt;in first and second, 4500 rpm in 3rd and when going to 4th it drops to 2500
&gt;or less. How can this be?


Do you have a ton of other gizmos in the bus? Like a slammin' stereo, or
lots of gauges, or extra lights?
I've found that any or all of the above can drastically change tach
readings, fwiw.

if you mean that the numbers seem correct, but WHY? I dunno :)
