Subject: installing check rods in cargo door

First I had to figure which was the missing rod.  The upper rods are longer 
than the lower, and the ones for the rear most cargo door are hooked near the 
mechanism, so I needed a longer, hooked rod.  okay.   (This was for a 65.  
there are differnt varieties of checkrods, some are thinner, some attach to 
the door mechanism differently.  the 65 has a machine screw and the rod has 
an eye. ) Now to install.

After fruitlessly trying for a while, and hitting the top of the door rather 
than the gap the rod is supposed to poke out of, what I ended up doing was 
standing on a milk crate and looking down the hole in the top of the door, 
aiming the rod towards my eye.   It had to be aimed just right to get in the 
right place.   Okay, that went fine,  rod installed.  Now I attached it to 
the mechanism and installed the mechanism.   The lower rod was jammed in 
place and would not move, so I ended up disconnecting the screw from the 
lower rod.  Will have to un mash door for lower rod to work.    Later.

Well, what with replacing the front cargo door mech and installing the mech 
and upper rod in the rear cargo door, now 3 out of 4 check rods hold it, an 
improvemnet over 1 out of 4.
