 By your post, the brake lines (hoses) are 4 years old, I've had 'em go bad 
 in 1 year.  You say the master cylinder was replaced and brakes adjusted a 
 year ago.  A year is a long time to go without a brake adjust if you drive 
 your bus regularly.  Brake adjust is a monthly maintenance item for the 
 Burrito Express, my daily driver which will see 42000 miles in 12 months.

sorry if I was confusing.   I replaced all the brake hoses when I started 
driving the bus about 4 years ago.    It had been sitting, and needed it.    
yes I put a new MC is in April.  However, I have adjusted the brakes since 
then.    I give it a greasing in the front end and adjust the brakes at each 
tune up.   However, with brake oddities one of the things I did do was adjust 
the brakes again.  I did remove the front brake hoses and could blow through 
them the same as through new ones, so I decided they were fine, and put them 
back on the bus.  The brakes have a nice volume and pressure of clean fluid 
coming out when bled, all 4 wheels. basically, what I was trying to say is 
that the brakes have had regular maintenance, clean fluid, and nothing is 
visably out of the ordinary.  new front shoes a year ago, no uneven wear on 
them, nice and dry.     yet it still pulls to the left.   the front right 
brakes do not grab as well as the front left.
