&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been running my 6v wipers on 12V for about 20 years. No Problem!. Now
&gt; they are fast enough to keep up with a real rain storm. The motor doesn't
&gt; even get hot. Soooo, don't worry, run your 6v motors on 12V! As for the
&gt; radio, it may burn out on the extra volts. The gas gage just pegs. What else
&gt; is there? All the light bulbs are replaceable with 12V units.

me too, about 12 years. Starter as well... I keep expecting them to burn
out. I have a 12v wiper motor to swap in when it finally goes, but the
damn thing refuses to break. I may go ahead and put a 12v flywheel and
starter in at next engine-out, but then again, I may just run the 6v
starter until it fries too. I like the !whiiiing! sound of a 6v starter
under 12v. Sounds like home to me.
