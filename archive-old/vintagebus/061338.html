&gt;     I admit being addicted to Everett Barnes' great website &quot;thesamba_dot_com&quot;

&gt; I will. Once in awhile, the grammer and the errors make me laugh, for
&gt; instance &quot; 65' Westfalia&quot; (I picture a camper sixty-five feet long), and I
&gt; wish people would remember that the abbreviation for &quot;etcetera&quot; is &quot;etc.&quot;
&gt; not &quot;ect.&quot;. But, it's the actual grammatical statements that send me
&gt; howling, for example &quot;all original, completely restored&quot; appears quite
&gt; frequently.
&gt; Today's favorite is a Karmann Ghia which according to the advertiser &quot;This
&gt; car only needs an engine and will run perfectly.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Am I the only one that notices these things?
