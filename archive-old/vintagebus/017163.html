Subject: Emergency brake lever interchangability/purchase?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks to the help of Mr. H. Steve Dolan I now have
brakes in the 67 Westfalia, ran well, brakes ok.  The 
brake system is far from perfect though.  It seems
that the PO reversed the rear backing plates when he
reassembled, so it being Sunday and not having seals
to the reduction box and no emergency brake levers we
opted to change bleed and adjust and I figured I will
make this change when I do the rear wheel bearings. So
here is my dilema, where do I find emergency brake
levers (the part that is attached to the backing
plate) or do I need to salvage these from somewhere.
If I need to salvage would ones from a 1970 be ok, I
figured they should because they have the same drums,
but who knows. Thanks,

Patrick Flynn
67 Westfalia
