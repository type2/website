0.5 ft. lb., same as all Bus screw terminal connections.

I have the torque spec. at home but I don't have time to look for the exact
page, that is why I simply memorized all my VW manuals.

Subject: [VB] Torque Spec Question


I was wondering if anyone knew what the torque spec was for the little screw
terminals on the taillight housings on a 58 Binz?  When I was down at Dan's
working on his Binz, I was messing around with the tail lights and for the
life of me, I couldn't find the spec _anywhere_ in the Bentley manual.
Anyone have any page numbers or references for those terminals?

Thanks for the help!
