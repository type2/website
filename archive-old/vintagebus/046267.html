 I just bought a middle seat, can anyone point me to a picture or explain
 what the handles should look like?  It's a 23 window version.

the grab bar on the back might be a round metal tube.  if so it is 60 or 
earlier.   
there is a one year only version wher ethe bar is round and covered with 
white plastic
62 and later the bar is like the 62-67 dash grab bar

passenger model had ashtrays in the back of the middle seat and pleats in the 
upholstery.
