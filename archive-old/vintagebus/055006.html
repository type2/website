Hi Staffan,
Stagger the gaps in the compression rings 180 degrees from each other on each 
piston so as to be at 3 and 9 O'clock positions as you face the pistons when 
they are mounted.  The single piece oil scraper rings at 12 O'clock.  Those 
oil scraper rings that are three piece you position the thin rings as you do 
the compression rings and the thicker center piece at 12 O'clock.  Do not use 
chrome rings they just wear out the cylinders and do not hone themselfs in 
for best compression.
