That $100 could be the tow home, registration fees, a
motor &quot;that doesn't come with it&quot; (even thought it was
expensive than a new Ducati), ect. Or it could go
toward the purchase of the correct parts the buyer
replaced with crap from FLAPS just so he /she could
sell it fast! Everyone, including the seller, is
looking for a deal.

&gt; If a car isn't fairly priced in a buyers eyes, they
&gt; should just pass on it,

True, unless the seller is selling it OBO. 

Just my opinion, but some buyers are really idiots.

..and some sellers are weasels that are selling cars
at inflated prices.
