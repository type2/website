Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure 

I have been pondering this for a day or so. Just my humble thoughts.
I. oil is incompressible
2. I you pump oil at a certain pressure into an oil pipe (whether it is a 
flexible line or an oil way) it will come out at the same pressure. provided 
there are no leaks how can it be other wise?
3. people are confusing pressure with flow. I know there is 32PSI air 
pressure in my tyres I know there is absolutely no flow.
4. If you reduce the flow by reducing the diameter of an oil pipe you 
introduce resistance this resistance to flow can only effect pressure by allowing oil 
to leak through the pump that is why VW gave tolerances for backlash and 
cover fit.
5.VW fitted relief springs to stop the oil cooler from being damaged.
6. brake lines are of such small diameter because you can use less material 
and it is easier to make and fit. 
 Remember these are just my thoughts, no attacks on any one, please no 
attacks on me.
