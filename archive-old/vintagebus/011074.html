my 2 cents worth on this :
personaly i use the gaskesinch
but another thing you must watch out for is that the mating surfaces be clean 
of burrs
and any irregularitys (as in PO's separating case with screwdriver), i've had 
to very litly file a case i did last year to smooth out the surface.
and then becareful to put enough sealant when assembling it .
no problems yet.
