Look to be to home made to be a factory tool. Looks like something used to
hang between the gates in my opinion.

A user on my site recently found these &quot;tools&quot; when removing his bed from
his truck, hidden down
underneath for years. Can anyone guess what they are, what they were for, or
if they are even
related to VW?

Hes speculating they are left behind by factory workers when building it....

the small bits look like roof rack feet perhaps?
