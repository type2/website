I just got done asking about my mcode tag when I got to thinking - maybe
type2_dot_com has some info.  Indeed it does - not all of it mind you but enough
to give me some neat info:

The tag reads:

11 8  (Which would stand for August 11th, 1965)  (This would have been the
1966 model year correct?)

425 002 081 114 130

I've confirmed the following:

425:???
002:???
081:walk-thru front seats for bus and Samba bus
114:6 popout side windows - bus
130:type 24 without sunroof and roof windows - bus

And then the last line is destination info:

UL: United States Port 'L'
2412:???
424271:???
6009127:VIN

No big surprises here.  I knew I had a 1966 low end deluxe but it's nice
seeing what the tag can tell you.
