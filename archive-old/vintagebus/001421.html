Mea culpa, mea culpa.  Sorry for wasting everybody's time (and bandwidth)
with my last message about going non-digest.  Thom has taken care of me -
thanks, Thom.

Regarding my other problems, I have ordered some classification 10.9,
12mmX1.5 bolts from a supplier in Stockton to replace the broken/damaged
ones that I removed from Sunshine (our '64 Westy).  I got the supplier's
name (Metric Fasteners Corp) from Thomas's register on-line
(http://www.thomasregister_dot_com/).  I had several other suggestions from list
members, but followed this on impulse.  After I had placed the visa order,
some of my co-workers asked what company manufactured the bolts.  I didn't
even consider this, as it was hard enough finding any company that even
stocked these bolts (sic).  In hindsight, it does concern me as these bolts
will keep my daily driver on the road and I have heard horror stories (e.g.
60 Minutes and the Ghia list) about sub-quality bolts manufactured in some
third world countries that are marked with grades exceeding the quality of
manufacture. Should I be worried?

Anyway, Sunshine's right axle is out and pending resolution.  I have gotten
one of the bolts drilled out to one size under that for a 12mmX1.5 thread
tap.  I have to go to the hardware store to get the correct size, as my
drill index has an empty hole where there should be a 13/32 drill.  The
really bad bolt has a broken easy-out stopping me from further progress
(yeah, its my fault so don't flame me about being stupid, as I have already
acknowledged that it would have been easier to drill out the remains of the
old bolt).

Anyway, thanks Thom, I'll see if I succeed in getting on in non-digest mode
and I'll see about the new bolts on Monday.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunsshine ('64 Westy waiting to be daily driver again)
