Hello everyone,

I have been lurking for several months.  Purchased a 1960 single cab in
early Jan 00 _at_ Pomona--very pleased, drive to work daily.  Finally got my VW
idiot book by John Muir.  I cannot find w/in the book or the archives what
is the correct wheel size.  I have 14 inch tires on and am assuming that the
wheels are too.  They look too small for a pickup.

Wet Sunday at Pomona, but found a wiper switch (appropriate for such a day)
for 10 bucks vice four times as much in the catalogs.  Hope it works?

Appreciate the comments.

Steve
