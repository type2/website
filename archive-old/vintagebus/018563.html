Mineral spirits and then silicone. Armor All, despite
what anyone tells you, is not good for rubber. Vinyl,
yes, rubber, no. Get yourself a product like Black
Magic, which is nearly 100% silicone. 

Careful about using any solvents on your seals, some
solvents will eat rubber. Mineral spirits, AFAIK, will
not.

&gt; Hello again,
&gt;   I was wondering if anyone had any good
&gt; recommendations on cleaning
&gt; paint from rubber seals and dressing them
&gt; afterwards?  Paint thinner,
&gt; then armor all?  Is there anything better?  Thanks, 
&gt; J.D.
