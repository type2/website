Well, now that my article has arrived back from the list, I see a
number of mistakes in it. Sorry about that!

Woops. Should be 6.4&quot;.

&gt; There's 25.4 mm per inch, so 4.60 inches equals 162 mm. For me that's
                               ^^^^
                               6.40

&gt; close enought to 165 to be real. Now the issue of diamater must be
&gt; considered. Tires without the aspect ratio (the 75 in 215/75-15) are
&gt; considered to be 80's. Therefore, the height of the sidewall on the
&gt; 165 will be 80% of 165, or 132mm, or 5.2 inches. Adding this twice to
&gt; the diameter of the wheel, 15&quot;, gives us 25.4&quot;. I&quot;m not sure what the
&gt; diameter is supposed to be, but I think that's close.

So I looked at the other email that arrived today, and the diameter is
supposed to be more like 27.16+/- .25 for a 6.40-15. That makes the
aspect ratio more like .95! So my assumption of an 80 aspect ratio
for tires not so marked might be wrong.
