&gt; 3) Using your keen eyesight, you should be able to see if the string is
&gt; floating across the front or rear part of any tire.  If you measure the
&gt; degree difference between the direction of the tire and the string - you
&gt; have a pretty good guess of the camber?


Actually, you would be looking at toe adjustment.
Camber is the postion of the wheel to perpendicular. If the top of the wheel
is in and the bottom is out, that would be negative camber.
Toe is the postion of two [front or back] in parallel to each other. If the
front of both are out more than the rear of both, that is toe-out. A tire
wearing condition. If the front of both are in more than the rear edge, that
is toe-in. Too much toe-in is a tire wearing condition. But you do want a
little toe-in, about 3mm total. As you drive down the road, the wheels have
a tendancy to go straight, equalizing the slight toe-in. Setting toe at zero
will cause toe-out at speed.
