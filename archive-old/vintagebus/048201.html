Subject: Tilt wanted &amp; Tilt for sale
Message-ID: &lt;f77e9c03.247f578a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a bay window type crew cab tilt (will fit '67 &amp; earlierjust fine) for 
sale/trade.  This is the cab height one with the venetian blind style roll-up 
rear canvas.  

What I am looking for is the original style '67 and earlier style crew cab 
tilt.  The later model is really more functional - easier access to your 
stuff &amp; less wind resistance - but this is for my Binz so I would like to 
have the original style.

Email for details.

Thanks,
Dan
