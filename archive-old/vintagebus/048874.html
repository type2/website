Subject: Help! Crew cab seat brackets

Help!

My 67 crew cab is just about finished at the bodyshop (been there 
since July, and not because there was that much to do)

Anyway, the nimrods have discarded the upper brackets for the rear 
seat that I had found.  It probably wouldn't be too hard to make new 
ones, but I am hoping for a bit more authenticity.

Anybody have a rotting crew I could get some from?

Happy Holidays!

Dave
