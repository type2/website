&gt;It sounds like the shop screwed up the motor one way or another.  Even if
&gt;you overheat the motor it will not die at #1 journal anyway.

I agree with Adrian 100%. Print out these emails and take them to the shop. 
He won't be happy, but who cares. Sounds like he's not telling the truth 
and trying to make you pay for his mistake. I wouldn't trust a replacement 
engine from him and would try to get $$$ back instead....but good luck with 
that!!!
