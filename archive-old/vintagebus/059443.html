Hi Joel,
Yes, you should have measured them!  Your idle pressures at hot/cold temps 
are where you should be at 3,000 RPM, not at idle.  Take them back out and 
check thier lengths against the ones listed in the Bentley 1968-71 bus 
&quot;Official Service Manual&quot;.  Since you have pushed the PSI well over 80 remove 
your engine and fan shroud to check that you have not swelled the oil cooler 
to the point of not letting air through the cooler!  BTDT when it turned out 
the forward spring was an aftermarket one in our then new engine.  Would also 
be nice to know what oil temps are when you have these oil pressure readings.
