I am 15 years old and just bought a 1967 VW Bus. I got it for $100 bucks from

The body is all true except for the very front. There is a small dent on the 
front of the bus kind of in the middle.
Is that repairable? How do I fix it? Can I go to a junkyard and get a new 
front?

are you in the columbia gorge?  Hook up with the gorge VW club, they are good 
folk.

  How does your bus run? 

  I wouldn't worry too much about a ittle dent in front, but if you do take 
the kick panels off in the cab (if they are there, get some 2x4s or what fits 
and and hammer and knock it out from the inside.  Think that metal has a 
memory and if you hit it out where it was knocked in it will pop out the 
best.   Replacing the whole front is a real big deal and at this point I 
wouldn't bother.  My 61 had a dent when I got it, then my boyfriend at the 
time hit a deer in it about 4 years ago, then it went into a ditch/fence.  
and the body has varous needs, but it is functional, well right now it isn't 
as the tranny is torn out and it got taken down about a month ago for repairs 
to take care of that delayed maintenance but fixing the nose is not yet a 
priority.  but that's me.  I like them as drivers, and do the mechanical 
stuff first, and maybe get around to cosmetic, paint etc sometime.

Also, I have no idea how to work on a bus, I just love how they look. Are 
there any good books/internet sites that might help me?

this list is good, and there are archives with  all the dribble that people 
have written on the list (s) for years.  Join NEATO (plug plug),   find out 
about local VW freeks , ask at your local VW shop, go to shows.        you 
may find that complete strangers walk up to you when you drive your bus and 
start talking about the bus they have or the one they had 10 or 20 years ago, 
or how your bus used to belong to a friend of theirs,  etc.
