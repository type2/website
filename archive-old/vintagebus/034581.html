In a message dated 98-10-25 21:46:00 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; It is round, and it does suddenly have a ball on it. And since you say they
didnt make them to your knowledge, they must be really rare? As for the lug
nuts I am no longer running the bus ones, but now have beetle brakes and lugs.

Hi Mike,
If it was made for bug then it would be rare here in the USA.  Over in europe
might be another matter.  Also it could be a bus hitch that was converted to
work on bug.  As for your beetle lug bolts they also came with different heads
also from year to year.  Hopefully though you are not using bug brakes on a
bus.  Eric &amp; Barb
