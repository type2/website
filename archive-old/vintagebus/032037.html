Its your bus, do what YOU want.
I mean if I want to mount a &quot;vintage accessory&quot; like for instance side vent 
scoops, and I want to hack out the louvers on the sides to do so, I should 
feel free.
If you want to butcher the roof of a barndoor, and hack up the cab divider, 
its YOUR bus, go for it.
Safaris are a different issue, You are not chopping anything out, Just 
drilling a total of 37 holes and welding in some brackets. And safaris are 
just plain cool anyways.
Me personally, I think barndoor roof scoops are silly looking, yes they are 
functional but.
Just my opinion.

&lt;&lt; I recently bought a jan 55 barndoor panel, vin #20-114468. Been sittin 
since

the 60's and the PO put newspapers soaked in oil covering the cargo area

which kept it in near perfect condition. Will be bringing it down in a few

months when my new house is finished (place to put it). I also picked up a

barndoor &quot;behr&quot; roof scoop for it (complete assembly).The &quot;problem&quot; is, I

have my sights set to install the scoop, but I started gettin nailed by

barndoor and vintage bus owners, saying I needed to be sent to a mental

institution for cutting the &quot;trademark&quot; barndoor peak.This barn has 60k

original miles, but needs a dogleg, a rocker and a few other pieces

replaced, so its not like it will be 100% uncut. So there is a dillema...cut

the roof for a rare original barndoor only accesory? or leave it &quot;original&quot;?

I refuse to even drill holes on an uncut VW, but since I will be replacing

metal anyway, whats the difference? I can save the piece and weld it back in

later if i so desire...One unnamed person commented I should take pictures

of the bd peak sacrifice as it will be &quot;neat to look at me cutting up a 60k

og bd panel in a few years down the road&quot;....( I think you catch his drift

=)...

Looking for vintage nazi list opinions?
