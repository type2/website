Subject: Re: [VB] windshield leak

Mike ,

It all depends where it's leaking from--
Is it leaking betwwen the body and the rubber, or between the glass and
the moulding??

My '61 Panel leaks at the outboard corners on the left and right
windshields. I had them removed by a local glass company. The seals were
replaced and the glass reinstalled with sealant. The leak is not as bad,
but in even light rain there is a steady drip, drip, drip. The glass
company said that the windshields are not original and the current ones
weren't properly cut and fitted. I won't be able to remove them again
without breakage ( I believe). I know this is a common problem, does
anyone have a fix?
