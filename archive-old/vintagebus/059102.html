Subject: Re: [VB] measuring springs

----- Original Message -----
From: &lt;VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; We went through our manuals that we have out of storage and could not find
&gt; the uncompressed length.  So pulled the one we have in our 1641SP DR CW
&gt; engine.  2.4&quot; (61mm) for the relief spring and 1.18&quot; (30mm)

The '63-'67 Workshop Manual gives an unloaded length of 62-64mm for the 1500
single oil relief spring.
I also have two 71mm springs and an 80mm. The 80mm is what is available new
(Bugpack, etc.) My '68-'79 &quot;Official Service Manual&quot; says that 68-69 use one
spring length, 70-71 use another, and 72 and on (whatever those are...) use a
third. Lengths are only given loaded, so I will have to load and measure them to
figure out what I have.
Anyway. I bought that Wilson rebuild book, very nice, did some reading and now
have a much better understanding of the system. An overly long relief spring
would not be causing crazy high oil pressure. A sticky oil control plunger
might, but new evidence came my way today. At a red light after a long freeway
drive on a hot day, oil temp at around 190-200 (pretty accurate), engine IDLING
smoothly, my pressure gauge read 90psi. I don't think this is can be correct,
either my new VDO gauge/sender has lost its way or somebody found a way to
install the oil pump from a Caterpillar in my VW case. (Cat at one time built
1823 cubic inch, not cc, aircooled engines. Sure it is one thing to put a big
aircooled engine on an airplane, or even a bus, this engine went in a Sherman
tank.)
Thanks everybody,
Joel and the white '64 Sundial
(on our way to Point Reyes CA tomorrow, if you see us let me know if there's oil
spraying out the back...)
