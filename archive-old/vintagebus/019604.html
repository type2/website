Naw, I can talk about safaris 'till the cows come home (of course, then
we'd have the burn the cows)

The plate is part of the bus, not the safaris.  you can install them without 
it.  The plate gives you captive nuts to mount the safaris, and some wiggle
room for adjustment.

I had to whomp on the area above the windshield to get the safaris to fit
right - they were too close to the bottm frame - and had to whomp the dash
a couple times for the inner tabs to clear, and I had to take some metal off 
of one of the tabs.

&gt; You all are probably sick of hearing about safaris, but looking through 
&gt; Thom's site, I noticed the Bentley how-to on safaris and they are showing an 
&gt; installation of threaded mounting plates for the hinges of the safaris.  
&gt; &gt;From what I have heard from the group, other than OG, the CE safaris are the 
&gt; way to go, which I plan to get, but I think someone said they do not come 
&gt; with these plates.  What do you suggest?  Will I need to fab my own and 
&gt; install them as per Bentley?  These are going into a '62 DC so I hear there 
&gt; will be beating and grinding involved.
