&gt; &gt; Ummm... why don't we just switch to yahoogroups or topica or something??

Because the Type2 box runs a lot more than the lists.  There's the
website, archives, AIRS, etc.  That's a lot more bandwidth than any of the
free sites are willing to handle. 

Also, it puts the data in the hands of
people who can be trusted (at least by me).  If we go to Yahoo, we haven
no control over what happens with the info.  As Yahoo's opening page says:
&quot;We collect personal data on this site.&quot;
