Subject: Re: [VB] Reproductions &amp; BD for sale

&gt;&gt;&gt;  As far as the tents...funny you should mention that.  My neighbor is a
&gt;seamstress who makes most of her money from making wedding dresses.  Surely
&gt;tents are easier to make than wedding dresses.  We have been talking about
&gt;doing some VW tent stuff.  We are checking into the cost of industrial
&gt;machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent &quot;have&quot;
&gt;to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent
&gt;that
&gt;is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with
&gt;floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.  &lt;&lt;


Sorry to disagree with most everyone else..

I think the most valuable repros are the EXACT reproductions.

If anyone could repro the Westy tent (I know there are several versions)
exactly, not only would they do some good business in complete tents, but
they could sell just the canvas (how many times have you seen tent frames
for sale?), or just certain parts of the frame (how many times have you
seen tents for sale which were missing one or more of the frame pieces?).

Look at the thread on safari window repros.  Everyone bitches about how
various repros fall short of duplicating to originals in one way or another.

Just my opinion.
