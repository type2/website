Subject: signing off for awhile

i'm signing off until some time next month.  if i understood the email correctly, the folks that run the bananaslugs_dot_com servers are going belly up.  i want to spend the time getting my web mail accounts cleared out.  mainly i want to reply to a ton of private emails that have been languishing.  ah, priorities - bus list, private mail, bus list, private mail... you get the idea.

ovwc:  my '67 beetle is hurt... mechanically, so i'll more than likely be driving my single cab to work (90 miles one way).  now that it has working indicators (thanks jon!), i'll not be so worried about commuter traffic though i think the single brake light will weigh heavy on my mind.
