&lt;&lt; I have a question relating to this, my gas gauge gets covered in 
condensation on
 the inside everytime I drive.  How do I dry out this sucker? &gt;&gt;  

the glass has broken its seal to the body of the gauge.  take it apart 
carefully, clean it, let it dry completely, they put a small bead of silicone 
(or your favorite gasket sealer) around the lip of the glass and put it all 
back together.  or option #2 is you are leaking a massive amount of water 
into your dash area via a bad windshield rubber.

have fun
