Subject: interesting gas station occurance
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A week or so ago when I left the house I noticed the gas guage was pointing 
awfully close to R, so I stopped and put 3 bucks in and the close but 
overpriced gas station.   On my way back home, I stopped at a cheaper gas 
station/market  on a back country road, by a trailer park, which I had never 
stopped at before.   I got out, grabbing the church key, and wet round to put 
gas in the bus.  I flipped the handle and watched the dials go round.  Yes, 
go around.  Like on a splitty speedo.   An old gas pump that is not digital.  
 A &quot;1&quot; had been stuck on in front of the price area.  

Well, I just thought it was kinda cool.
