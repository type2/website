&gt;So I was paying so much attention at Pep Boys to the GL rating &quot;gotta get
&gt;the GL-4, not GL-5&quot; trip that I plum forgot to get the right weight.....does
&gt;this mean that I must take the SAE 140 weight and get some 90-w?   What's it
&gt;all mean, anyway?

The 140 is the thicker of the two.  It would make your transmission
quieter, but stiffer until it got warmed up.  If your weather is relatively
warm year round, it's usable.

&gt;I'm thinking that the hard-to-shift, howling tranny in our new '66 Westy may
&gt;be able to be helped with new shifter bushings, possibly new front and rear

Nope.   If it's howling, how would a shift bushing help?   I would do it
anyway, but don't expect a miracle.  The 140 *would* silence the hounds of
hell.

&gt;tranny mounts, and Slick 50 tranny glop.  (Hey, it worked in my old

Ick.  Slick50 is a cash transfer device.  From your wallet to theirs.

As with any of the pour-in panaceas, does anyone ever stop to consider that
the just-realized improvement is probably due to changing the stuff?  Like
the people who swear by the twin-prong plugs - &quot;uh, I get better mileage
now.&quot;  Well, Jethro, when was the last time you'd *changed* the plugs, or
gear oil, or motor oil, etc, etc.
