Erin scrawled...

Well it turns out that some of the parts I've ordered from Barrett
Enterprises are crap.  The reground lifters that are supposed to be
concave aren't - they are flat.  The local guru looked at them and said he
wouldn't use them.  Okay - I can send them back. The heads were supposedly
rebuilt units.  Little did I know that hiding under the silver spray paint
job was a complete set of used valves all the way around.  To top it all
off, the intake guides are the originals and looser than what the specs
should be.  The exhaust ones have been replaced but reamed too much so the
valves are still sloppy.  I've already had them semi-hemi cut and bored
for 90.5's so I can't return them (another $100). I'm looking at $50 for a
new set of valves, $100 for labor to have the guides replaced, and the
cost of the guides themselves.  All I ended up buying from Barrett was a
set of junk heads which is exactly what I have a mountain of out in my
storage shed.  I spent $150 for a set of junk heads - can you believe it?

Hi Erin,

  Yes, I can believe it.  There are many jokers out there in VW land.  
I'd try to settle it on your side with Barrett.  If they said they were
rebuilt and you found on inspection that they were not, they lied.  If
they balk, there are enough people that have been following your saga that
we can send a letter from your supporters or the type2 list (if Thom and
Dworkin agree) which will object to their business practices.

Best,
joe
