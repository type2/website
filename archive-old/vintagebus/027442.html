Subject: Engine Questions

I've been freshening up the DP 1600 that was in the 62 DC this week, and
have a few questions.

Can I reuse the old push rods?  They are straight and look fine.

Do I use sealant on the oil cooler seals?

Do I need to use the gaskets that originally came under barrels?  I was
told by the VW flaps to just use RTV.

Do I need to use sealer on the cylinder head nuts that are in the valve
gallery?

Is Pomona next Sunday??

I couldn't find these answers for certain in the Tom Wilson book.

Thanks!

Steve
