Hi Jerry, 

We all know that Ronnie only speaks the gospel, but I just independently
confirmed that the CE units do come polished for a small extra fee.
Price is ~$615 USD plus shipping. I have both their front and rear units
and love them...

  Bus-Boys does not sell Safaris anymore that I am aware of. John Howard
just put Wolfgangs front and rear polished stainless steel (truck)
Safaris in his (now gone) V8 DC and they seemed to look good and fit
well. Wolfgangs front safaris alos have changed the latch to O G style
wide base!
  C E's are almost exact copies of OG and they do offer them in polished
aluminum. Their frames are now double walled aluminum (same construction
as OG ones, except aluminum), these fit great and also look good.
  It is best to CALL C E to order, this way you know for sure that they
got your order and get a verbal delivery date.

Still haven't heard from anyone whether they have had any experience
with 
Wolfgang or Bus Boys Safari's. I can't seem to get a reply to e-mails
from 
Creative, and it doesn't appear that they offer polished frames.

Jerry
