Subject: NEW aluminum case pics

ok, round 2. thanks to ronnie (&quot;craig, at this point its not about 
losing money!&quot;) feitson, aip sent me a new aluminum case. Why go back 
for more punishment? Mainly cuz ronnie would replace the old case 
with a mexibrazil stock one, but he would eat the cost; aip would 
only replace like with like. anyways, i have a page up with some pics 
and some first impressions:
www.ckoon_dot_org/vw/case/newalum.html

sorry about the wiggy html; my program is so old it no longer 
remembers half its commands :P
