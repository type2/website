Subject: Clutch

I am in the process of putting the engine back in
because I just changed the clutch and the clutch
operating lever (that was fun).  So anyway I am trying
to put the motor back in and it wont go back in.  I
know the problem::  the pilot alignement tool I have
is too large for the VW clutch and the clutch disc is
out of alignment, therfore making it impossible for
the engine to go back on the trans shaft.

MY CHEAP_ASS SOLUTION:  I figure that instead of
trying to find a pilot tool for it I can tip the
engine on its front on a block of wood and have a
buddy hold the engine with the flywheel up in the air
level.   I can eyeball it good enough and tighten the
clutch pressure plate.  I figure that the oil will
shift around but as long as I let it settle and check
the level before starting there should be no harm.  Am
I correct in my shade-tree assumptions???
