In the course of the turn signal questions, someone asked about
using electronic switching instead of relays.  This is possible,
but relays are still a cheap and reliable means of switching
in an automobile.

The first thing you have to deal with is that an automotive
electrical system (6, 12, or 24V) is full of noise, spikes, and
over- and under- voltages.  These are not conditions that tend
to make solid-state electronics happy.  Modern fuel-injected
cars have diodes across every relay and solenoid to help
suppress the spike generated when they turn off, to keep from
damaging the electronics in the car.  Major modules like the
PCM/&quot;brain&quot; have a lot of filtering on their power supply
leads.

The next thing is the voltage drop of some electronic solutions.
While it is true that there will be a voltage drop across
relay contacts as well, it won't be as high as the 0.6v you
might get out of a bipolar transistor.  This voltage drop
reduces the power delivered to components and generates heat
in the transistor.  Something like a MOSFET will have a much
lower voltage drop, but will be much more susceptible to
spikes and noise.

The third thing is the packaging issue.  A bare transistor
or MOSFET is not very auto-installation-friendly.  You have
to find a way to mount it to the vehicle (or a heat-sink)
and possibly to electrically isolate the mounting.  Then
you have to connect to the transistor...trying to solder
2 12-gauge wires to the closely spaced legs of a TO-220
package is not fun.

There are &quot;solid-state relays&quot; that address these issues...
they come in packages with reasonable terminals (screw
or tab) and mounting arrangements.  The internal electronics
take care of filtering and transients.  Sometimes you can
even get them cheaply ($5 or less)...IF you want to switch
AC.  The DC solid-state relays tend to cost from $20 on up.

Compare this to a standard Bosch relay, which can be mounted
in a socket or to the chassis with an integral tab.  If you
shop around, you can get 40A SPDT versions for $5.  The
socket (with about 30cm of wire preinstalled) adds another $2 
and you're ready to go.  Another advantage is that most
FLAPS carry these kinds of relays...handy for field
replacements.

All this is IMHO of course.  I've put in several stereos and
two-way radios, plus before I moved to the city I did the
radio, light, pump, etc wiring on the trucks at the local
volunteer fire department.  I've used lots of those standard
relays and, for now, I'll keep on using them.
