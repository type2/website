Subject: Type IV Conversion Progress
Message-ID: &lt;37464F40.9DBFE555_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

I am finally making full steam ahead progress on my Type IV conversion.
I gave my last two final exams at the college this week, so that frees
me up a bit to try and pull this all together.  A number of parts have
arrived and others are on their way.

I have been bench testing the CIS fuel injection and its almost ready to
go.  Joe Lociero at Oregon Performance Products cast me up some aluminum
bosses to mount the injectors to the intake manifolds.  I had them
welded and the spray pattern into the head looks good.  Gary Miller at
Miller Fuel Injection fabricated up a set of new hoses for me to pull
this all together.

I threw together a few photos of the CIS test bench at
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/cisbench.html

About the only CIS item left is to get the control pressure regulator
working.  The one that I have seems to want to try and keep the pressure
about 20 psi too high.  Gotta fix that.  I pulled it apart, cleaned it
up and it made a small 5 psi difference.  Looks like I'll be making a
trip to the junk yard.

The cooling shroud has long been here from Oregon Performance and its
just itching to be installed.

The Bus Boy's IRS II conversion kit arrived earlier this week and I'll
be working on that this weekend.  Looks like a simple install.  Will end
up keeping the truck at stock height.  No lowered stuff here.  And if
desired, the Redux boxes can go right back in.

Bus Depot's load of wheel bearings, seals and brake parts are being
installed (by me).  The seals and rubber will be later after the engine
is running.

I just missed the delivery of parts today from Bob Donalds' at Boston
Engine while out fixing my water pumper.  I guess I'll just have to wait
till Monday.  This is my crank, rods, bearings, etc.  Bob should be
shipping the heads sometime next week.

My POR-20 and seals arrived today from Aircooled_dot_net

Todd Hill of Volkswerks Transaxles should be shipping my transaxle soon.

Three weeks and counting to OCTO and Irvine Classic.  If I make it down
there, it will be a very close call.  One thing I don't want do is rush
and cut corners to make the weekend.  There's always SOTO.  Its so close
to my house, I could literally push the truck over there and barely work
up a sweat.

Since everyone is always talking about vendor xx and service yy.  Let me
say that this is looking like the truck that internet built with
EXCELLENT service from the folks below.
