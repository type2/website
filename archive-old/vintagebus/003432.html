Another 5 weeks goes by and he now wants to reneg on the deal.

The other guy's outta luck Woody. As far as I'm concerned, once he's had
your part and had a chance to look it over a deal's a deal. I know that if I
got a part that I for whatever reason decided I didn't want.
I'd get the other party on the *PHONE* right away (meaning that day or the
next) and settle up.

Sounds to me like he's got a buddy or somebody near him that wants the part
you have.
Maybe somebody's waving enough cash around to make your partner foam at the
mouth to get his (or more appropriately what once was his) part back.

No matter what, I'm getting pretty sick of list members trashing other list
members over deals that have turned sour. Especially when they haven't tried
to settle up privately.
