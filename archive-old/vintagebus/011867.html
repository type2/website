&gt;I just learned this one trying to replace my generator.  I'm not even 
1/2
&gt;way done and I should have just pulled the engine.  The Archives told 
me, I
&gt;didn't listen &lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;

On the other Hand.....
If you get used to doing it without taking the engine out it really isnt 
that bad. Generator replacement is of course easier with the engine out 
but can be done with it in. After you get the learning curve out of the 
way, it is much easier to do then pull the engine on a road trip. The 
trick is to hold up the fan shroud with something while you yank the gen 
out. I have done this many times and find it alot easier. Remove 
fanbelt, loosen fan shroud, remove four bolts, and  its out.
