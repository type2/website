I put in a Compufire with a 009 dizzy earlier in the summer.  The old girl
runs like crazy!  No hesitation what so ever, a bit quicker, and it even
seems to growl a bit when I get on it.  Very happy with it.  Of course I
still keep my other dizzy with points all set to go in the back of the
westy.  Ronnie walked me through the installation with much patience...a
million thanks Ronnie.  If I can install it anyone can.
