I have a lot of respect for the author of this response, but I also consider
that it isn't practical for everyone to carry all this -- plus, not everyone
who _drives a bus_ has the skill to _repair a bus_.  Even if you can repair,
having weeks to solve a problem at home isn't the same as taking it on at
the side of the road.

Another alternative:  Before you go on a trip, get phone numbers for 4 or
more people on the mailing list who are active.  Also get a AAA membership.
With luck, you are within 100 miles of a listee who will let you borrow
tools and workspace.  Networking, ain't it great?

If you are ever on a trip and need a number of someone who can post to the
list, p-mail me and I'll gladly give you my cell phone number, I'm sure I'm
not the only one who can be called 24x7.

Don't wish to discourage carrying all the tools listed, just presenting that
the skill and confidence of knowing the cause is another issue...

Thanks, was just waiting for that kind of response.  It is amazing how much
folks think that we carry too much and joke about it.  Then when they are
broken down and in need of a part the jokes stop and they are so polite, and
pleasant.
