Subject: 21 Window Samba by Maisto

Sorry if this is a repost, I hit send instead of close on the other one!

Since no one has posted about the new 21 window Road and Track bus
thought I would let others know that it is
out. Debbie found one yesterday at Wally world and I found two today at
another one, I guess the dealers must
have missed these.

I have posted a pic to Thom's toy section.

Good Luck Hunting!

Meredith
