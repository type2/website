Howdy all,

Due to my recent purchase of a Thing, the '65 Sundial camper is going to
have to go.  I know, I know, but that's just the way it is.

Here's the scoop.  It's a '65 Sundial hardtop camper.  It has what appears
to be the original interior (bed, sink, icebox).  I used it as a daily
driver for a while this winter, but it's being sold without an engine.  It's
been converted to 12 volt.  Some SPO hacked a hole in the dash to put a
bigger radio in.  It has had some of the lower half of the nose pushed in a
bit at some point, and is a little ugly down there.  I would say it's
repairable without getting a new nose skin.  The rocker under the side doors
is rusted out, and there are various small scratches and dings.   It needs
paint.  Other than that, the body is quite solid.  The only real hack is the
dash.  It has nearly new tires on it and a new clutch cable.  It also has
the original California Housing Authority tag on it.

I'm asking $1000 obo for it.  If you're interested, I would really prefer
for you to come and see it as it is a fixer-upper and I probably haven't
listed all of the little things that need attention, and I don't think a few
digital pictures will do it justice.  Feel free to e-mail or call me.  I'm
located in Bloomington, IN.

Thanks,
