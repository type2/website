Did anyone see the slammed show bug at the Classic this year? Near the toy/souvenir tent. A purple bug completely flattened, as in destroyed, to the ground, surrounded by ropes, other doo-dads. I think it was called Crushed Velvet. They had awards, pics from other shows. Great satire. Anybody have pics? 

While you're waiting for a VW only judged show, enter your beasts in local hot rod or concours type shows. The entry fees sometimes go to charities and you'll make an impact, I guarantee. Fertile leads for parts! Spread the bus mojo, and learn how judged shows work. 

BTW, search www.fresnobee_dot_com 's classifieds for a 1956 Karmann Ghia. First year of production, supposed to be complete, $2k.
