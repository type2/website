&lt;&lt; Now, my question.  Has anybody else had a little trouble getting the link 
 pin dust covers to go on?  The diameter seems to be just a tad large.  I 
 tried freezing them a bit, still no go.  I'll file the edges down a little 
 today, and then put them in the freezer, and see if I can get them to go.  
 Anybody have any suggestions?  I thought of putting them in a bag with some 
 dry ice, thus making them even colder (and smaller).
  &gt;&gt;
yes, cause they get a tad bent-  check for roundness and be anal.
