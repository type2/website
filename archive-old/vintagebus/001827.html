Hey,

&gt;&gt;it looks like the other driver was trying to go through your bus!

Yes indeed, the other driver, (an infinity SUV), did almost go through the
bus.  Here are some stats:
Passenger side(point of impact), pushed in 4.5 ft.  Driverside(other side!)
pushed out 1.5 ft.  Camper interior, splintered beyond recognition.
Passenger Window failed to stop my forehead, thus the red stain down the
front.  seeing the look on peoples faces when they see the pic is priceless
to me, (only because it worked out the way it did!)

&gt;&gt;Hope you're alright!

As for my condition, I really don't know what to make of it.  Neither do the
doctors.  I wasn't supposed to wake up.  At least for another year.

&gt;&gt;What does the other guy look like?

If you are speaking about the driver of the SUV, I don't know, but I am sure
the airbags cushioned the fall.
