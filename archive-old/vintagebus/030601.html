Sorry but I have been busy at work and was just catching up on the
digest &amp; noticed that people are looking for the Moret triangles that
hold the left side air cleaner to the fan shroud. Yes I have made these
for a while, as well as other pieces that I have needed for our
restorations. Another item we make are the bus sunroof sliding block
repair kits that you are getting from WCM and Wolfsburg West.
If anyone needs any of these triangles, I have plenty at this time but I
am out of the small extensions that are needed as well to make them work
properly.
