Subject: won't cold idle

Howdy Volks,

My 58 sc with 1600 dp, 34 carb, 009 dizzy runs great when warm, but when cold
it does a wierd thing....It runs for say maybe 5 seconds-30 seconds then
gradually trips, stumbles and dies. The warmer it is, the longer the period of
fine running, and finally at some point in the warmth scale it will trip,
nearly die, barely keep running then speed back up to idle (which I have set a
bit fast, maybe 1000 rpm) So it is occillating idle. My electric choke is non
functional, but if I run back and manually adjust the stair step choke
thingey, it makes it run at high idle, until the stumble occurs.  What is
likely causes and cures?  I know that this common carb-dizzy combo is also
full of problems and I have not tried the rivit in the carb plate trick
yet.....

So, a few specific questions:  Timing first, then carb adjustments right?  I
have dizzy set for 30 degrees at 3200 rpm.  I am at 5000 feet elevation.  Any
better timing tricks at altititude?  One thing I noticed, is when warm, I have
virtually no fuel in the paper filter between tank and carb.  I have never had
lack of fuel symptoms at throttle, but am I looking at some problem with fuel
delivery (pump)?

TIA!
Wes and TikTok
