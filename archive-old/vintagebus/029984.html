&gt; &gt; This can get to be tricky deciding who is in and who is out.--

&gt; Following that line of reasoning that arbitrarily excluded Uncle Jerry's
&gt; Hearse, and referring back to today's earlier post regarding the Westfalia:
&gt; if the Frickinger Hearse was disallowed, also disallowed would be all
&gt; Hebmuellers, Westfalias (and other camper conversions) as well as Binz's.
&gt; Also left in the parking lot would be the various fire trucks, ambulances,
&gt; taco stands etc..
