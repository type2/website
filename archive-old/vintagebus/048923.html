I will be headed to BBtA probably Sunday morning and returning sometime Monday from/to the Chicago area.  Is anyone else going/coming at those times - this will be the first long trip for my 78 (I just got it back from the shop this morning) and I'm a little nervous.

Please reply directly - not to the list.

Thanks,
tyler
