&lt;&lt; Hi all, I'm 21, and just got my first Bus a 1966 13 window deluxe in July. 
I 
 could really use advice on fixing a problem with fourth gear. I can drive in 
 fourth but I have to keep pressure back on the shifter or it will jump out 
 of gear. Any ideas on fixing that? I also will be rebuilding the redux boxes 
 soon and wondered if anyone had any advice on what to look out for, common 
 mistakes, and any warning signs I should look for while they are open. 
 T &gt;&gt;

sounds like the tranny is needing a rebuild.  I drove with a bungee 4th for 6 
months before swapping over,   you should start saving for a rebuild or 
hunting for a guanteed good one.

in the meantime chnage the tarnny oil (RGBoxes and center section ) and make 
sure the screws on the shift coupler by the nose cone are snug and wired and 
after than you could try adjusting the plate at the bottom of the shift stick 
on thecab floor, and using a bungee cord to hold it in 4th on the freeway, 
but this is a thing that happens, sound slike time to save for a rebuild.
