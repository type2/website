Subject: Re: [VB] Trackers ... was Someone stole my engine?

Scott, I'm still a bit confused, what parts are in the bus and what parts do
you need at home to track it with?  I also noticed on your last email when
you were tracking your daughters car, you had it on a map, how were you able
to do that?

This really does sound like a great addition to a vehicle, and with
teenagers driving, this would be a great way to keep track of your kids (I'm
sure they would hate it, but what are parents for?).

Thanks Scott for all your information.


&gt; There is a unit called TinyTrak  ( http://www.byonics_dot_com ) $33 with
&gt; shipping, that is the radio modem.  It takes the ascii output from the GPS
&gt; receiver and converts it to FSK and then keys the radio.  In addition to
&gt; this you will need a metal case to house it all in, some wire and
&gt; connectors.  The last one I built the case was $14 and misc
&gt; stuff/connectors came to $35.
