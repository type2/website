The front dolly is lower than the rear, so you use the same 
height on the stands and keep th ebus level.

The advantage of my design is it's great for taking the wheels
off and doing stuff, and even better for removing the transmission.

I would have made them a couple inches wider if I made another set,
and used larger diameter wheels.  

I also made my own &quot;jackstands&quot; which let you drop the bus almost all
the way to the ground - the brake drums clear the ground my about 2&quot;
