Subject: Re: Camper Interiors

Those are some nice setups, though after having a few Westies with the full kit I've found I prefer a minimalist &quot;weekender&quot; style package -- mainly just a z-bed and table -- especially in a non-poptop westy.  My current setup includes just a 3/4 z-bed and snack table, both scrounged from bay westies:

OTOH, if I camped in inclement or non-Florida weather I guess I'd want more stuff inside the vehicle.  And if it was an original vintage camping interior, you bet I'd want it all there.  But I find myself happier with big tupperware bins that I can pull out and set on the ground, making the interior roomier.
