Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

I had the 'sit-on' style of disconnects on my '56,  I'd park the wiper on
the left side, reach out the window and lift it off, then open the safari,
then reach out and park the wiper properly.

Without leaving the seat,  and without getting my oversized hands caught 
under the dash.

&gt;      Being rather thirty (okay cheap) when I had my safaris in my '57 single 
&gt; cab, I did not have safari wiper shafts.  I found that I could reach the ball 
&gt; and socket on the stock wiper shafts and pop them loose so I could fold down 
&gt; the wipers.  The thing I liked about this was I could go full flaps in a 
&gt; matter of seconds, and never leave the drivers seat.
