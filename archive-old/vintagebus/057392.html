&gt; in to stay on course. I also have an altimeter and vertical speed indicator
&gt; so i can figure out my true aispeed from calibrated, then use the VSI to
&gt; vary my decent rate down those arkansas hills. hehehe!

For a bus, don't you need a variometer in a bus?  A VSI doesn't seem to be
sensitive enough. :)
