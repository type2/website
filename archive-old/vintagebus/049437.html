Subject: sheet metal/windows needed

Greetings vintage list:

I am a regular member of the bay window list.  However, I have a friend,
Dan, a serious VW guy, who is restoring a splitty and is looking for some
sheet metal.  Specifically, he is looking for both rear corner and quarter
windows AND FRAMES from a 23 window.  They need to be in reparable
condition with glass preferably.  The lower corner sheet metal is not
needed.  If anyone has a lead on these items, please pmail me at
timatt_at_fwi_dot_com and I will put you in touch with Dan.
