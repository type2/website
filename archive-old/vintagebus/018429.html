Hi list, Barb and Eric,

I was looking at the link off of type2_dot_com's library tech section.
on the link  &quot;Time-Sert&quot; by E&amp;B
and then to spark plug thread inserts in their page
 http://www.timesert_dot_com/sprksert.htm
they mention V.W OPTIONAL TOOL
what's that?

Also, if you (anyone) has a spark plug kit what size is it?
part #?

Thirdly, how many of you as a matter of course use these as a part of a
normal head rebuild?

aloha

Ken
