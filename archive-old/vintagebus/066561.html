Subject: RE: [WetWesties] FS: Odell the Adventurewagen.

Dar,

Please take the following with a (grin)...


&gt;&gt;My kids are sad, but my wife is happy.

This statement is an all-to familiar scenario.  VW's require a certain
dedication, most are not up to.  Before trading-in your VW, perhaps you may
want to consider a trade-in on the wife!  Sounds like you have gotten many
useful miles out of her, but it's time to move on...

Be very wary of individuals promoting the separation between us, and said
VW's.  VW envy is a serious issue, not to be scoffed at.  I can see already
the children have taken a liking to Odell, and let's face it, you were the
one to pick her out of a list of prospective vehicles.  The wife is feeling
threatened, and has 'suggested an alternative'.

Odell is not merly a vehicle.  Please take note of her name.  We do not
typically name inatimate objects.  There are, more than likely, no names for
the house blender, TV, stereo or golf clubs.  I am even willing to bet other
vehicles in the garage are not named.

Yep...Better to cut 'er loose, before Odell has any 'Accidents'.(I did say
GRIN, right?) - K
