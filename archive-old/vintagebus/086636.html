Subject: Re: [VB] need part

As Eric said, providing the year and especially on Type 2s, the Vin Number
is important, especially when dealing with front end parts.  However, in
this case, the &quot;Protection Cap&quot; for the Link Pin is the same on all years
thru 1967.  And even if the original sender's email address indicates &quot;60&quot;,
I would not go as far as to assume that is what the sender's year is.

211 405 533

They are usually provided in link pin rebuild kits, but were available
separately back in the day.  Today, new ones, separately or in a kit, are
close to being made of unobtainum, especially for models through 1963.  Good
used ones can probably be had though.  Give a call to Walt at Bus Boys (530)
244-1616.  Betcha they've got some.

&gt; Hi UJ,
&gt; I was hoping that you might be able to help me.  I am one part away from
&gt; getting my bus back on the road and cannot find the part i need.  It is the
&gt; cupped washer that goes on the link pin in between the tortion arm and the
&gt; spindle.  Do you know of anywhere i can get one or could you put me on touch
&gt; with someone that could help me?
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Morning Dove
