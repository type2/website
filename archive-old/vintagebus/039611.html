I'm in need of some '67 deluxe chrome flipper handles for inside the front 
door.  (the ones that look like toilet flushers).
Also looking for a complete front and rear bumper!  I know I know...but mine 
are beat to ever, and I just need some good ones.  I realize this was 
recently discussed, but what is the situation (quality) on aftermarket ones?
Thanks,

Wes Daniel
