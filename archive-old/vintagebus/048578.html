That is a good price for the westy, it would be well worth the money, even
if it needed work.

I have a number of split and bay busses (about 35).  I love to drive the
splitties for their coolness (is that a word?)  The splits have an &quot;air&quot;
about them that nothing else can come close to matching.  They look great,
are easy to work on, parts are fairly inexpensive and easy to get.  To put
it in a nutshell, driving a splity will just make you smile from ear to ear.

But the &quot;big top&quot; bay window westy is wonderful for camping and long trips.
With disk brakes, a larger and longer life engine, ball joint front
supension and IRS rear, the bays will travel so much easier and faster.
You can't beat that huge bed on top!!  The engine are more expensive to
work on, but will out last an &quot;upright&quot; type 1 engine twice as long.  I
think the bay window busses are classics and I do like the looks.  You will
get the ear to ear grin driving a bay too.

I do have a '64 deluxe that has all the paint and body work finished, I
need to do the interior, that I will use to run around town, go to club
meetings and close to home shows.  But the '76 westy will be for camping
with my daughter and long distance shows.

Both the bays and splitties have their good and bad and both have fairly
low insurance rates and property taxes, so why not have 1 of each?  They
sure look good under the carport!!



&gt;A freind of mine has just ran into a westy for sale. It is a 74 and this
&gt;probably is not the place to ask, but I am not on the bay window list
&gt;and there seems to be a lot of people here that have multiple westys. I
&gt;wanted to know how many westys in 74 came with air conditioning. He only
&gt;wants $350 for it. Needs brakes, but runs. Paint and seat covers in the
&gt;front are pretty rough. No rust , not even in the battery area, but a
&gt;football sized dent around the other side tail light. I have heard that
&gt;this might be a better bus than my 65 for cross country trips, but I
&gt;have heard something about the type 4 motor dropping valve seats. I had
&gt;a 914 but never experienced this. Things like the disk brakes, larger
&gt;bed, AC, higher gearing , and the double bed on top sound pretty nice.
&gt;Dropped valve seats, expensive motor parts, and smog checks don't sound
&gt;that good. If the AC is kind of rare it might make it more of a find.
&gt;either way it is kind of cool with the condenser bolted to the bottom of
&gt;the bus. Any info would be great. I have not even ever driven a bay
&gt;window, only my splitty and a vanagon.
