Ever since riding in Dan Kinsey's Binz back in August, I'm sold on them.  I
like double cabs but the lure of an old first edition Binz leaves me in
bewilderment as to why I have to have such an expensive taste.  I must say
that not only was I honored and priviledged to go on frequent rides with Dan
with the safaris open, but I got to work on the thing as well.   I got to
put in new tail lights and diagnose electrical problems (which Dan and I
solved), and I got to do a quickie-quality NQ rebuild on a 67 front beam.
Dan's Binz also sports a 1776 so it isn't a bone stock machine - it's better
than that - it's the ride of rides.  I noticed subtle differences such as it
feels like you are sitting farther forwards on the bench seat than in my
walk-thru deluxe and rolled lip of the parcel tray was a bit thinner.
Overall, I just like the Binz.  Oh yeah, a factory DC is awesome but just
the sheer cheapness and primitiveness of the Binz conversion is alluring and
I don't know why. :-)

One thing I've entertained is trying to find an old roached out Binz - you
know - something that is minus about every moving part and then finding a SC
of the same year and you guessed it - fabricating my own Binz.  That would
be a project of projects but at least you would have the original POS Binz
to use as a template as long as enough of the original metal skeleton was
there to go off of.

Had I known of that $1500 Binz, I wouldn't have bought it but you can bet I
would now.

:-)

BTW:  There are shots on my website of Dan's Binz

Dig that EMPI steering wheel!
