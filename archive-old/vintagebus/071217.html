Subject: Road Trip:  Bus Aquisition

I'm flying to Texas to get a new bus.  Details of that bus will be forthcoming
after I've driven it home.  Suffice it to say that it is a '66 Westy.

I'll be making this trip starting this Monday...I should be in Trinidad, CO,
by Monday night or early Tues.

I have my route out of Texas planned:  Dallas-Wichita
Falls-Vernon-Childress-Amarillo-Dalhart-and then to Raton, NM, where I used to
accompany my mom shopping, and then to Trinidad, CO, where I used to live.
(There's at least one person there I'd like to see again)

From Trinidad, I am thinking of going to Walsenburg, then west...Alamosa,
Durango, possibly stop and see Mesa Verde...then through Cortez, and then
Utah...north to I70, seeing Arches National Park on the way, then
Price-Provo-Salt Lake City and westward across the flats OR continue on I70 to
I15, and then north on I15 to 6/50 west to Ely, Nevada, then
Austin-Fallon-Carson City, see Lake Taho for the first time, then go to Nevada
City to say hello to some friends, and then over to Chico to say hello to
another friend, then north to Red Bluff and west to 101 on 36...from ther on,
I'm in Shasta Trip country, and mere hours from my home between Eureka and
Willits.

I'll probably be home very late Thursday night or sometime Friday.  Let me
know if you think my guesstimations are incorrect. (Unknown amount of time
saying hello to people!)

Anybody care to suggest small changes/revisions?  I'm hoping for a scenic, but
not too arduous or roundabout trip.  I'd love to meet anyone who happens to be
on the way ( I hope I don't &quot;need&quot; AIRS!)

I'm willing to carry parts from one place to another if anyone needs that
service. (I'll go no more than an hour or so out of my way on either end,
though)

Wish me luck!

Gene Cornelius
