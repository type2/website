If Thom's gonna be at the Red Barn in his bright yellow DD VintageBus panel, meet there at 11 a.m. and introduce yourselves. Do the same at Kelly Park. If you can't find the VintageBus, find Ronnie selling his wares soon after 11. The best meeting spot is standing around a single cab, you can lean on the gates and look people in the eye.  If you're flying in, ask for a lift from the airport. NQ &amp; Rod did that for the Lake Havasu meet and got a 100+ mile lift from Britt. Sheesh, this is a family, you're allowed to ask favors.
