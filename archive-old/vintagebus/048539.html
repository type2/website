You can't always get to the blocked passages by removing the jets alone.
If you look on the outside of the carb, you will notice &quot;ridges&quot; on the
carb that look like termite tunnels.  These are the passage ways for the
fuel to flow within the various carb circuits.  Many times I have had to
remove the soft plugs that the factory put in place when they drill these
passages.  Usually where two passages meet will be the most likely spot for
blockage.  I have even had to drill the passages where two come together
and the factory passages didn't meet causing a restriction.  After you
finish your work, find some 1/8&quot; solid core solder and replace the factory
plugs.

&gt;   Well, so far the concensus is that there is something wrong with the idle
&gt;   jet. I did use almost a complete can of carb cleaner on it, pulled the
&gt;jets
&gt;   and blew them out with the cleaner. I also went thru EVERYPLACE that even
&gt;   remotely looked like it might be a passage ( had carb cleaner in my face
&gt;   when they weren't).
&gt;   Thanks for the responses so far, I'm still working on it.
&gt;   BTW, for those of you who suggested a vaccum leak, nope, all connections
&gt;   etc. are good and tight, no holes where they shouldent be.

&gt;I hope you can get this one answered.  I did the same thing to one and got no
&gt;results.  It was, I suppose, a clogged passage somewhere.  I was successful
&gt;with one 34pict-3 however, by running compressed air through all of the
&gt;passages and it corrected the idle problem.  I think it is usually hit or
&gt;miss.
