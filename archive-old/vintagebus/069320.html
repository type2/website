Subject: Re: [VB] Front door gaps.....

Well, I loosened my door hinges, and slid a .080&quot; thick washer between the
hinges and the body, to narrow the gap at the other end of the door.

Wrong move. The gap at the front of the door then looked too large, and made
it look reeeeally funky. Guess I'll live with my 1/4&quot; gaps. LOL.

More than anything, I'm just trying to make sure my doors are lining up
exactly like they need to, so I can check something out that is related to
all this.  Can anyone else measure thier gap to see if 1/4&quot; is 'normal' or
not? I don't have any bus friends here in SLC yet, so have nothing to
compare it against.

Thanks,

&gt; I have a large gap where the back edge of the doors meet the body. It's
like
&gt; the doors are slid foreward too much. I measured the gaps, and the
passenger
&gt; side has a gap of .250&quot;, and the driverside is .300&quot;.
