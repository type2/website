Hi Cal,
If you do not have a garage you can buy a tarp, some rope and make a shelter 
to work in.  We always carry a tarp on trips for not only wet weather, but 
also so as to not be baked in sunny weather when working on the VW.
Your sudden whine could also be the cooling fan has cracked around the hub!  
BTDT!
