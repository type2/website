Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What shocks do you prefer

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;  If I want the mush ride I would use oil shocks only.

Matter of opinion. I like a soft comfortable ride myself. They are valved to
have very little resistance when bound, and more on the rebound on purpose.
Makes the ride much smoother by letting the wheel move up when you hit a
bump, rather than have it transfered through your rump.

If you don't like the ride your bus gives you while driving in a straight
line without any winds blowing you around, THEN change your shocks. If
you're looking for better handling (cross winds, winding roads, etc), then
you should honestly be looking at running swaybars on your bus. Stiff shocks
are NOT a substitution for body roll. Both front and rear swaybars are
avaliable for split (and bay) buses. You can have the best of both worlds.

I run oil shocks and swaybars on my 4200 lb. westy, and I take turns at the
same speeds as all the other cars on the road and it runs great. I do 75mph
down winding canyons comfortably, and during crosswinds or when semi's are
passing me (or me passing them), i'm able to stay in my lane just fine.
Treat the symptoms, don't just cover them up guys!
