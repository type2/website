Subject: FS: Corner windows

I recently came across a pair of rear corner windows for a split. (They're all
the same aren't they?)  They're in a late 50s/early 60s bus (Had beehive turn
signals) that is way to far gone for a restore.  (No floors!)  Anybody need
them?  They have virtually no fogging and are unengraved (no Sekurit, etc). 
Seem to be a nice pair of windows. From the weathering of the rubber, I'd
guess original.

I'm a bay/vanagon owner and my split days are twenty years behind me, so if ya
got any specific questions, p-mail 'em and we'll do our best to answer.
