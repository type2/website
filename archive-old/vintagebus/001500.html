Well i raised mine to $30.00/ hr first of the year. and plan to keep it that
way for quite a while ,,, it has taken me a few years to get it to this
point but i feel the quality of what we do is well worth the amount, and
plus , we take a pride in what we do. Also a note , i usually eat some
amount of labor on every unit especially if its one that has alot of hidden
chit that bites us on the _at_ss. Another thing also ,, alot of time of mine is
spent it jigging and figuring out how to make parts and how to do what needs
to be done in certain areas of the units ,, i eat all of that for the most
part, It takes me days on some thing to figure out how to do things rite, as
in Thoms right hand drive stuff,,3 b-pillars later i had what i figured was
close to rite, and i was made from several differnt peices of metal welded
up not no pressed parts all hand fabbed for the most parts with basic
fabbing tools, i'm slowly adding tools and tooling as i can to do the parts
better and the buses also , i've spent as much or more in tools and such as
most have on their buses during a resto. I try to come with ways to make
parts we can't get or are in poor quality when we do get them.
In addition to working on 2 to 3 buses we are adding a section of shop 24X24
for fabbing, working on the belly pan thing , heater tubes, the Y in the
heater tubes at the rear, possibly floor sections for the front ,and
possibly even battery trays both sides, and in the midst of this i'm
demolishing the old shop to the ground to make room for the other one. Guess
what i'm doing on my saturday ?.. hope this helps.
