E-mail's acting up, so I didn't see the first list...but I didn't see anything
in Kyle's list that sounded excessive. I also toss in assorted engine parts.
I'm thinking of adding a milk crate to the inventory, as I find myself doing
top-end rebuilds on milk crates even though I now own a regular engine stand.

When I show up at local swap meets, I almost always have more good parts
stashed away in my bus than some of the swappers...though I'm a little short
on chrome-platted cherry picker accessories these days.

I like milk crates .  I have a metal milk crate someone had covered with shag
carpetting- it's a really great thing for the garage, as I can sit on the
cushy seat while I stare into the depths of a engine compartment.   Good idea
for a road trip, or as camping furniture.
