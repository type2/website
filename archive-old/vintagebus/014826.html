Don't laugh - I've never seen a back seat of a splittie. 

Now, for the question -- I have access to a ton of bay seats, so I tried one
in mine, but the center leg of the thing hits that heater duct gizmo.  How do
the splittie seats look?  Do they have the center support or not?  What would
I change on the bay seat to make it as much like a splittie as possible?

Thanks in advance for the help!
