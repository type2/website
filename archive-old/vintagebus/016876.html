hey all, i have a couple questions...
i have been driving my bus for almost 4 months since the snow stopped flying 
and have a few questions. (1) im only getting about 17 mpg, whats the order 
of things i should check to improve? carb? points? plugs? my mechanic says 
thats ok, you guys all seem to get 30!! :) (2) this is puzzling to me... i 
have a small nut tranny in my EARLY '66 converted to 12V. while cruising 
down the freeway on this newly paved stretch (flat) i look down and im doin' 
70, easy. she doesnt even seem to be over revving. i need to hook up my 
tach. she is a bone stock SP 1500 that runs strong with a new 31-3 
delivering fuel.
i know there was one more question.....
thanks,
