&lt;&lt; The fan housing tubes are/were closed off. We have taped the holes from 
the heat risers with alum. tape. The guy at Oval's said the heat would not go 
into the engine compartment and get pushed away from the van, but I wondered. 
Anyway the temp seems to be unaffected after putting the heater boxes on, 
either hotter or cooler. &gt;&gt;
Hi Wink,
Right!  With the tubes sealed off to the heaters the pre-1972 bus heat 
exchangers just heat up and up.  They are designed so that cooling air goes 
through them not only when you have the interior heat on, but even when the 
interior heat is off.  The valve that turns on/off the heat to the interior 
of your VW is a double flapper valve that also opens (When closing off the 
heat to the interior.) a cooling opening in the back of the head that is 
shaped kind of like a shell of each heater cooling the exhaust.  Without this 
cooling of the heater tubes the exhaust gases are not cooled and condensed.  
Instead the gasses stay hot and continue to expand causing extreme back 
pressure against #1 &amp; #3 cylinders which in turn causes more heat to be 
transfered to the heads and into the engine.  
  We prefer the paper covered aluminum fresh air tubes to the heaters better 
than the plain aluminum ones becase the paper stiffens the tube quite a bit.  
This does not allow as much flexing which tends to break the aluminum tubes 
up or allow them to work loose at the ends.  
  The plastic ones might work fine but are a lot harder to find and we just 
had not mentioned these due to this.  Eric&amp;Barb
