Can anybody direct/tell me what is in the dash of a barndoor deluxe, center and right side pod's, or direct me to some good photo's, have been to thom's and vwplanets pictures and haven't seen any good close shots.
&gt;&gt;
Left to right:

Radio or block off
Clock

The pic with the block off is from the recent resto of that '54 Deluxe by Lenny Copp.  Rumored to have been sold for $53k?  Nice Bus!  Dump another ~$4k into it and you'll have a vintage-nazi-approved vehicle.  ;)

I noticed Dan sold his '53 Kombi on eBay for ~$8200 last night, guess my '55 Kombi is worth more than I thought, bummer.
