i agree with E&amp;B about the fuel thing though. I have experience that if it
drips fuel especially when turned off it will be the float valve. The
valves in the rebuild kits are often bunk. I dug through a box of ancient
carb parts and put an old valve in my newly rebuilt carb and it solved
just that problem. 
I have entertained the idea that you could take a bad float valve and
using a solution of grinding compound in water spin the valve pin with a
drill or hand chuck and actually seat the valve and make it functional.
the valve consist of only 3 parts machnined body, plug bit (which contains
the seat), and the valve pin.
anyway obviously ive been spending too much time thinking about this.
