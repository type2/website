To the List   Well being a newbie I am going to have
times like these.....WOW !!!! I saw my first
perfect(viewers choice) bus and geeee great for me it
had to be my bus....well what mine would look
like(except for the non stock stuff) if I was so
inclined to get then spend the bucks on her to take it
that far.Deluxe 13 window white and blue in Monterey
this past weekend on Cannery row.With a not even stock
sounding engine and a T handle shifter.Sounded like it
could do a wheelie to me and he tried...sort of.Rack
on top and a shine and depth to that paint with
perfect fenders(never seen one much less two).....As I
looked at it I could not see any flaws....Just
awesome...I am a fan now of you guys with the show
winners but I guess my place will be in the come like
you are class.But if my retirement fund kicks
in...read...(Calif Lottery or Dads trust fund) I will
be there with you.Or I get a better paying job...I
will have to have one Perfect Bus....Buy the way what
is a ball park price range for paying someone to take
an average Deluxe...with all the pieces in place and
with good brakes and trans...but in need of a fresh
1600 go for nowdays....3...4...5..thousand????
Oh...Thom I like your jokes good stuff....a bra would
have helped .....Ha!
