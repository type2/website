&lt;&lt; I bought some 6 mil clear plastic sheeting from Home Depot, but what the
 heck do I stick it on with?  I'm considering 3M Weatherstripping, but that
 stuff is pretty permanent, isn't it?  Also considering rope-caulk, but I'm
 not sure if it's sticky enough.   Suggestions??
 
 Thanks!! &gt;&gt;

i use glue stick (UHU) the kind you used in school.it works like chap stick 
but doesnt taste as good . works fine for me, and when the need comes to pull 
it off for adjustments/repairs, it sticks back with no problem.
