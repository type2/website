Subject: oak

Personally, I wouldnt use white oak unless its a garage kept beast. I
would use mahoghany, which is expensive, but u really shouldnt need that
much. It will hold up real well outside. The key to it lasting will be
in the finish. I would not recommend polyuerathane. I would use good old
fashioned spar varnish, but make sure it has uv inhibitors. Too, will
want to sand the wood to 80 grit and no finer. The deep scratches
actually help the varnish adhere. You will need many many coats. I dont
remember the number but it is something like 20 coats!! The reason is,
if u don't use that many, the uvs will get down to the bottom layer and
cause it to come loose.
