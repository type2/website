;I've been thinking about adding a second speaker to my single cab so I

choice?

looking for a

Gordon,
I have the same radio setup in my 65 Westy. I installed a pair of Craig
surface mount speakers under the dash. One hole(drilled by PO) for each
speaker. They fit under the parcel tray out of the way. Sound is as good
as the Radio can get it. Actually it seems to be a clean install. I can
provide you with the speaker numbers if you want. I believe NQ had a
pair of 3-ways mounted in the same way. He could tell you better than I
