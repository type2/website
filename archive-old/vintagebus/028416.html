I thought this was the type of posts that got you thrown off the group.

I too dropped the bay window group because of the ebay stuff. Seemed like half
my mail was ebay. If I had an interest, believe me, I could find it myself.

What does admin. have to say?

&gt; &gt; &gt; SOLD THE CAR TODAY FOR $10,500.  EBAY RULES!
&gt; &gt; I'm sorry,
&gt; &gt;
&gt;  but not only did you
&gt; &gt; advertise your mr2 on the bus list, you posted about it yet again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; this is NOT why i subscribe to this list,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thank you,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have to second that feeling.
