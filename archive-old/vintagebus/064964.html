Subject: 600 mile of mist,fog and rain&lt; txas to la. and back&gt;

What a two days of mist ,fog,rain and cold weather. My lourny started out at 11:00 a.m. Friday morning. i left central Texas heading for central La. mist and fog starting out, i arrived in Houston at about 2:00 p.m. i stopped at the Shell station on FM1960 for myKrispy Kreme donuts ,then set out for la. i notice a VWdealership across the 290 freeway so i went back to check it out. It was Advantage VW, what a nice dealership, super nice people.,. on to la. , i stop at Harra's casino in Lake Charels La. to make my yearly contribution  to their cause. 9:00 p.m. i stop at Emery's restraunt inEmory la. for supper. 9:30 I called my wife back in Texas , she said the hotel had just called and ask if i wanted to cancell my rooms that the show in Lafayet had been cancelled. I  headed back to Texas as fast as my single cab would take me, I spent the night in Baytown Texas on the way back home. Igot back home about 1:00 pm Saturday. Through all the water i lost aCD player and running light, Hopefully they will work when they dry out? so much for arriving a day early and restting up.  the truck ran great in the cooler weather  . The weather can be a real son ov a gun this time of the year,   Stay dry,   Paul
