One word:  TIRES TIRES TIRES...

Grrh...... here comes the tire FART again..... has 2 weeks gone by that quickly??

Having good tread does NOT mean doodily squat!

If you have passenger tires, you don't have good tires. You need 185R14C tires or better. The C is for
COMMERCIAL.
NOT load range C passenger car tires.

Here is some reading material:

 I purchased a '74 camper that I am generally pleased with. Other than a lack of power, that I hope to
slightly remedy with a carb sync and a general tune-up, the only thing I have a problem with is handling in
the wind.
&lt;snip&gt;
and the tires have good tread. I don't know about the shocks or if
it has sway bars (?) installed. When the wind hits it, it really drives the
bus sideways and does not respond right away to correction. It's not as bad as it was before I had the front
end work, but my '65 splitty responds
better than the camper. It has a full pop-top.
