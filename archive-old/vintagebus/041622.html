&gt; &gt; I have the same philosophy.  I bought a 1 inch breaker bar but now I'm
&gt; &gt; having trouble finding sockets.  I found one place that had sockets but
&gt; &gt; a 36mm was $28!  That's more than I paid for the breaker bar (used).

Thats not a bad price at all. If you want cheap youll have to scour for
used and in 1&quot; that wont be easy. I found 36mm at www.sktoolstore_dot_com
which has pretty darn cheap prices for 23.65 but then theres shipping...
