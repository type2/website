As another list admin, I'd like to make that stronger.  DO NOT patronize
any spammer!  The fact that he harvested the web site is particularly
nasty.  Here are people who have volunteered to help others and their
reward is spam.  That stinks.

He does have a toll-free number if you wish to express your opinion about
spammers and harvesters:  800.248.8535
