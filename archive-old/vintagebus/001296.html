[...]No bus content, but I thought I would forward this as it might have an
impact on our use of the internet!

&gt;A  House has a bill set up for a vote ASAP on whether to charge long
&gt;distance charges for Internet access even if you dial-up locally.  This
&gt;is something that affects each of us.  Please read and forward:
&gt;
&gt;  Congress will be voting in less than two weeks. CNN stated that the
&gt;Government would, in two weeks time, decide to allow or not allow a
&gt;charge to your phone bill equal to a Long Distance call EACH time you
&gt;acc=
&gt;ess
&gt;the Internet.
&gt;

&gt; form!
