&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dick and his cousin . . have whipped together a
&gt; &gt; wind-tunnel for this guy who races trucks at
&gt; &gt; Bonneville Flats . . .
&gt; 
&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Think you can convince Dick and his cousin to run a few vintage bus
models
&gt; through there to get drag coefficients for them?  Curious as to the
&gt; coefficient for my double cab.

It has been done, and oddly enough the bus has a lower CD than a
B**tle. Unfortunatly, it also has a larger frontal area, so the
overall drag is higher!
