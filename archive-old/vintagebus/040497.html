Subject: A New *dunk* sound

I have a '67 bus, and yesterday my bus began to make a low ryhtmic *dunk* 
sound when the engine was running. This occured when I was coming home from 
shopping, and it ran fine getting out there. The only odd thing that 
happened was I clipped a curb making a turn on the was out, but the sound 
did not start immediately after that. Further the bus seems to have a 
significant loss of power, and as I give the engine more gas in nuetral the 
rate of the *dunk* sound increases. Finally I opened the engine lid with the 
enginge running and the engine physically moved when this sound occurred.
If anyone knows what this is or any help on what to do I would greatly 
appreciate it as I am not the experienced diagnosing busses.
Thank You and Happy Holidays
Ben Eilerman
