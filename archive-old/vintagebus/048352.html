This came from the Houston VW Club list. It's not really bus related but 
maybe someone has seen the body?         (bus content...   I figure the trans 
problem I was having is the fact that the trans was 2 qts low on gear oil)
&lt;&lt;Charles Boucher, who was supposedly restoring my Hebmüller #6, the oldest 
in 
North America, has lost the body to my car. He now will not return my calls. 
If anyone knows the whereabouts of body #6, please contact Don Garies at 
dgaries808_at_aol_dot_com. Thanx.
