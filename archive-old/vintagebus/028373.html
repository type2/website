&gt; How does this apply to driving with safari's open?
&gt;

A reread of the section finds it to say &quot;shall be equipped with an adequate
windshield.&quot;

I searched all the code sections and could not find a single section that
said anything about the windshield being in place.  I think that one could
make a very good argument in court if you were driving with safari's open or
a Thing's windshield down, that both vehicles are &quot;equipped with adequate
windshields&quot; and that the law does not mention anything about the required
position of those windshields.
