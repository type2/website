It currently is a white, but I am unable to tell if it is silver-white (to

match the steering wheel?) or pearl-white to match the dash, etc.


I'm not going to restore my steering wheel(s) yet, but they're all

silver-white (except for the black ones, obviously) right?

 I believe it matches the steering wheel, not the dash, or the knobs.

talking about steering wheels, any idea why most white horn buttons were 
black plastic painted to match the wheel, while a few were cast out of  white 
plastic?  The ones cast white hold their colour better.
