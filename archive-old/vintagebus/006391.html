Just to let you all know about the fiasco I had with Barrett Enterprises.  I
returned the parts along with a written list of how much I expected them to
refund me.  The parts included was the P/C set and all the cores.  They
should have received the parts sometime around the end of December.  By
January 22nd, I still hadn't heard anything from them which I thought was
odd because I had instructed them to fax me a copy of the return list, or to
mail it to me or email me - something to show that I was being credited and
they had received the parts.  January 26th was the magic date when the fax
rolled in.  The coversheet said something along the lines of &quot;sorry for the
delay.&quot;  At least they included a copy of the actual VISA card credit.  A
day or 2 later the actual U.S. Mail version of the credit sheet arrived so
they did notify me twice - nice touch.

I just found out today that the heads I received from Barrett (keep in mind
that these are GEX rebuilts) are a mismatched set and I wasn't aware of this
before.  One is a type 1 head and the other is a type 3 head.  Isn't that
great?  This explains to some extent why there is such a difference between
the 2 heads in the CC readings.

I'm not going to stand here and force my opinion on others as to what I
think of Barrett Enterprises.  Rest assured I have formed an opinion of them
and so with this information at hand, you can decide for yourself as to
whether or not you wish to do business with them.
