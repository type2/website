I know Matthew already knows of this web site, but for those of you that
don't and are interested in painting busses (or for that mater any auto),
you should really check it out.  Its called Autobodystore_dot_com (all one
word).  It is run by a guy by the name of Len Stuart out of NJ.  All sorts
of information and tips as well as a great how to video.   Sells product &amp;
tools  at good prices also.

The best part though is the bulletin board.  It is VERY informative and
updated constantly.  I wouldn't hesitate to say that any body and paint
question would be answered there.  I have no affiliation with Len or the
site...just great content for every one, including novices like me.  Here
is the address in plain text:  http//www.autobodystore_dot_com/
