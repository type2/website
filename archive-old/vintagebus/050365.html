Subject: headliners and hatch glass.
Message-Id: &lt;v04204e01b3674ed3e958_at_[209.75.206.201]&gt;

Thank you all for all the help so far.
I am having major back glass problems.
When I posted to the list my need for a back glass I wrote it was for a
1962 15 window deluxe.
A guy in L.A. had one for $20 so I said send it.
I got it and it is TOO long.
A guy in Arizona wrote me saying for $20 he had the correct back glass.
I said send it.  I got it and it is too short and not long enough.
I guy in Seattle who sent my hump cover to me for free just pay postage
wrote and told me he had the right hatch glass and I could have it
for free if I pay the postage.  I got it last night and it too is too
small.
I am very happy with folks like Steven and Ronny and Lenny and Jeff.
You guys have gotten me where I am on this project.
VW folks are a great bunch of people!
But, I still have no back glass...
I met a guy at the Jamboree who is painting a 1962 Deluxe and told me
he would draw around the back glass and send me a pattern to take to
the glass folks, but I lost his business card.  Glass place can't
make it without the old one or a pattern.  The hatch hole is 14.5&quot; by
32.5&quot;.
I got a set of interior panels yesterday from Lenny and of course
Everything is good except the rear hatch piece.  It is too long.
Oh, and the top of the tire hump cover has too sharp of corners.
I must have the wrong hump cover for my '62, or the top is for another year.

I am also having headliner problems.  How wide exactly do you cut the listings?
How long are the bows supposed to be?  I was missing one, so I got a
60&quot; one from RMMW.  The two in front are shorties.  I have these.
The one all the way in the rear is shorter I have this.  Are the
other four the same?
How long are they?  I have three of the four original and one is 15mm
shorter than the other two.  Where does this shorter one go?
I have read all the archives on installing the headliner.
Nothing about listing width or bow length.

Sorry for asking so much but I want to drive my bus.  It is costing
me a bundle and I am collecting many spare parts that won't work on
my 1962 15 window deluxe.  Everything I buy costs twice as much.  Let
me explain.
Wife says I can work on my VW's but, She gets equal time and money.
Saturday is mine Sunday is hers.  I spend $500 on the bus, she gets $500.
It's all fair in love and VW's.  I wear the pants in the family, and
my wife says &quot; I get my way or you can just keep them on&quot;...
Thanx all for all the help so far...
