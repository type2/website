Subject: Throttle cable tube 'needed'
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990711002859.0091dc30_at_pop.primenet_dot_com&gt;

Hey,
Now that I've 86'ed the POS Microsoft email software and set myself up once
again I can ask...

Can anyone hook me up with the correct throttle cable tube for my 36horse?
&lt;Ronnie?, Everette?, Richard K? VWFool?, Kyle?&gt; To clarify, I am seeking
the kind that has an angled &quot;U&quot; welded on to the tube just as it emerges
through the rear side of the fan shroud &lt;closest to the bumper side of the
shroud, R is R per Muir&gt;. The tube that I currently have in the bus does
not have the U brace for the spring and bell. It tends to let the cable
stick. The current set up is not totally correct. 
I saw the &quot;U&quot; brace kind of tube on an extremely correct original low
milage early Deluxe in June. I have the same carb set up, so... If ya know
what I mean then you know what I mean. Otherwise ignore this msg.
Thanks in advance.
