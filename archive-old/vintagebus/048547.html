&gt;Hello, I have a T2 1978 VW Bus and want to tow a 5x11 foot trailor. Is
&gt;there a tow bar for the 1978 Bus? Where do I find one? Please e mail me
&gt;with any information.           Thank you, Shlbele

If you can weld, has a friend who does, or have a good welding shop around,
you would be much better off making one that goes all the way up to the
torsion.  By attaching to the torsion, you are pulling on it, not you
bumper.  You will need to attach the back of the hitch to the bumper, or a
better way would be to run a bar from one side to the other, to each bumper
mount, or frame.

By doing it this way, you are pulling on the torsion and the frame is
holding up the tongue weight.

And according to the manual, you should only pull 1400 pounds without
brakes, 2300 with brakes.

You may also want to post to the type II list ('68 - '83?), this is the
splitty list.
