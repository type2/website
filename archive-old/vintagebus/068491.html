Subject: Re: [VB] Newer Beetle speedo in early bus?

Adrian,
Get a GPS:  it'll show how fast you went, total
mileage, average speed, top speed, etc.  I won a long
distance award one time with a GPS that showed I went
438.17 miles!

JP

PS  (It also showed that I hit 84+mph on another trip
in my '61 Flipseat Westy.)

&gt; would like to have a 
&gt; good means of showing it if I ever go that fast :) 
&gt; Granted I cannot imagine 
&gt; over 80 would be a common thing, if ever.
