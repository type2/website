This is a good point.  However, I was worried more about increased
corrosion rates on the exposed connectors (brass screw terminals,
remember) where the wiring harness connects to the semaphore.  I
suppose I can just make it a more-regular maintenance item, or slather
the thing in vaseline once it's all put together.

Thanks.
