Subject: Suggest where to get *good* bus parts.

In preparation for my 66 bus &quot;renewal&quot; project, I'm wanting to replace some
major parts with brand new ones.  I'm wanting to have a nice solid driver,
just as good as my 74 Super, with the intent of going places and doing
things.  So right off the bat, I want a new front beam, new steering box,
and following the suggestion of a kind listee, I'm gonna get a swingaxle
tranny made with 74 Super gearing and leave the redux boxes on for the
ground clearance and added durability.

I've been looking around
