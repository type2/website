Ellis is pucked, and from the pix, it looks like a
cool setup. Maybe I should puck up my westy, but think
I'd be truly pucked if I tried to drag one with a
36hp...

Ellis sez,
I cannot and will not comment on the condition of the
Puck offered for sale as I have not inspected it. Good
luck to the seller and the new owner.

We like our '68. Paula refuses to part with it. One FS
in OR looks to be 70-71. Ours sleeps far more
comfortably than the Westy. My prefernce is simplicity
and tend to want to leave it behind for the ease of
just having the bus to deal with. It always works out
fine with it along. The lil' Mrs. likes comfort, wants
to load us down with ALL of the camping gear. I prefer
to stay married. so... 
I had major concerns about hauling the Puck behind our
bus. No problems behind the built-up 1776 with Del
Orttos and machine work plus extra cooling/guages.
With that in mind, it tows transparently behind us and
in fact seems to help the cross wind stability and
smooths out the ride.
Brochure shows a mid 60's TypeI parked at the top of
the Continental Divide. Brochure also shows a Puck
camped behind a Renault Dauphine. Pfft! Even at 660lbs
dead weight/75lbs tongue wt., I wouldn't tow with a 36
or 40hp. One of the guys in VTO drives a Barndoor and
a  really bitchen wooden camp trailer.
Cautions for towing: Don't over-load either trailer or
bus and expect to cruise slower.  Make sure bus'
brakes as well as the drive train and
steering/suspension are in great shape. Give much more
braking distance than normal. Bill Bowman drove the
'67 and Puck combo part way home to Phoenix from 1999
Havasu camp out. (I was in the back nursing the post
*Jose flu). Bill approached a down hill traffic light
and under estimated the stopping distance. Light
turned red at the last minute and grabbed gears and
brakes plus threw all anchors overboard in order to
stop in time. We all had puckers in our seats after
that one. Whew!
