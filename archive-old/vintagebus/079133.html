Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt flasher on 65 bus

Go to Wal-mart.  Buy the generic boat trailer light converter.  With some
creative wiring, the turn signal will only operate the turn signals, and not
the brakes also,  they will be separate circuits.  Put both of these into
the box.  With this setup, you will just put one regular blinker relay
before the turn signal switch.  I've done it on at least 4 VW's to date.

&gt; Hi All-
&gt;
&gt; I am putting together a 65 bus that will be running 12 volt. One of the
items that I need to make 12 volt is the flasher (unless someone came come
up with a better idea).
&gt;
&gt; Had a look at the WW web site and came up with 211953227BGR being the
closest match. $125 to make my lights go blinky blinky is a bit over the top
for my tastes. Surely there must be a better way to do this.
&gt;
&gt; I should mention that I have a new wiring harness so don't wanna start
hacking into it- nor do i wanna start drilling holes in the bus to make
itfit. Would rather use the stock mounting place next to the fuse box.
&gt;
&gt; Please pmail me as I am reading in digest mode.
&gt;
&gt; With any luck another bus should soon be on the road in Ontario.
