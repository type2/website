Subject: Tank Swap

  I just did this same swap on the 63 panel. The 71 tank fits ok, you need
to fab some extra supports for bottom of tank (I used some 1&quot; thick neopreme
rubber pads) and extend the tank mounting straps about 6&quot;. For the vent I
used a 5/16 brake line and ran it along the top of the tank and bent it up
through the filler area and then bent it 90 degrees so it fits into the
original vent/ overfill drain pipe that is in most or all? split buses. It's
nice to have twice the gas

  I also had a fire ext. in my bus at BBBIV so add me to the total, looks
like a lot more people carry them than originaly thought. I have mine
mounted to the left of the drivers seat in the area between the drivers door
and seat, fits great and easy to grab. Never go anywhere without it.

 Thanks for all the private comments both pro and con on the event last
weekend, they will all be kept confidental as some got right to the point on
issues and people, reviewed and changes will be made next year. Keep your
comments coming.

 Have the 64 totaled camper stripped to the bare body, will see if I can get
Stephen G to come over Sat and take some pictures to put on the list to see
if anyone needs body sheetmetal. Only the left rear from taillight out and
most of left side is bad, rest is good.
will also sell complete as is, have legal Az. scrap title on the bus so it
has paper work.

  John Howard
