Subject: Free 68 Beam (Md) 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

For those looking to upgrade to disks this is a nice
beam.  The vehicle is located in Arnold, Md just
outside of Annapolis.  The whole vehicle will have to
be taken.  All 4 wheels roll, 2 are flat so
replacements would be needed if you are interested. I
plan to strip the remaining stuff off this weekend and
the next.  My wife would like this eye soar out of the
yard. Pictures can be found at

I am parting out most of the good stuff but would
leave the tranny and steering assembly on for an
interested party.

Thanks,

Patrick Flynn
