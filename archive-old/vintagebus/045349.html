Hi Brad,
Is your accelerator linkage not going back to the idle postion quickly?  If
so it might need to be greased, or we have found it works better with both
the early on throttle cable return spring and the late engine return spring
on the carburator at the same time.  Otherwise there was not enough return
pressure.  Have you been good and applied a drop or two of oil under the
distributor rotor every time you tune you VW up?  Could be that your
centrifical wieghts in the distributor are sticking due to lack of
lubrication.   Eric&amp;Barb
