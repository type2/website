Subject: Do the fan belt stretch

Hmm, I hasten to write this email for the lack of knowledge with belts
but here goes.

I too have had a problem recently with the contitech belt stretching.  I
put the belt on, as usual, and with in a very short distance, it was too
stretched out.  I purchased the belts at a local VW parts store on
8/7/00.  I only drove a max of 100 miles and it was too stretched and
the my oil temps were high to prove it along with a weakened battery.  I
went back to the parts place and they looked at me like I was a freak.
I told them that I had always run these belts when I drove my beetles.
I have had the bus for two years and the belts ran great until now.  He
started offering suggestions but the fact is that there were no more
shims left and like a friend at work says, &quot; you can't squeeze blood
from a turnip&quot;.

So as for a bad batch of belts; that will get my vote.  I am off
tomorrow to by another one and try again.  I did try buying a a smaller
NAPA belt yesterday and drove it tonight to see what if it helped.
Let's just say that the only thing left of that belt is strings.  Some
how another the right hose off the fan come came off and got caught in
the belt.  I think that I tightened the belt a little too tight.

Well, back to the house of belts.
