no no no no...
I pulled up to the gas pump today. my usual pump.  87 octane regular unleaded
gas pump.  I pumped the gas as always and noticed it was green... I figured
it was just the winter brew of fuel... and now I realize it was diesel...but
I was not at the diesel pump. I was at the regular gasoline pump.  They
messed up filling up the large tanks or something.  It was a greenish
gas...like mostly diesel, and part gasoline from what was left in the tank
before the dope decided to fill it with diesel.. I'm off to have a word with
those people in a while.

&gt; Hi Isaiah
&gt; Let me make sure I read this right - You pulled up to a pump and watched
&gt; the guy put the diesel in and now you want to know what recourse you
&gt; have against the gas station?!
