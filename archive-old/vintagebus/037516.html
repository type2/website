  I don't know if I'd call 911 and tell them you are burning magnesium. They 
won't like that. You can call and tell them that you are performing a 
controlled burn, but you must be the land owner (in Missouri anyway). 
  If you do burn a case and the fire dept does come, let them know what your 
burning before they put water on it. They should be able to tell by the light 
it puts off but you never know. Some firefighters I know look for any excuse to 
play with their hose.
