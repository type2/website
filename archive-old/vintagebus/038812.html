&gt;&gt;From: &lt;ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
Yesterday I went and looked at a Binz in a salvage yard.  The Binz tag was
missing but I knew from replacing the headliner in mine that the guys at
Binz
had been known to write the number on the underside of the roof.  I pulled
down the headliner and, viola', there it was!  8-)  There was also another
word(s) there.  German of course.  Looks something like &quot;Fairbeufloin&quot; or
something very similar.  The picture
turned out very clear so it should be easy to read if you can read German.
If anyone can translate it for me I would greatly appreciate it.
