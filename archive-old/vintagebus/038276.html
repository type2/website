Hello Everyone,
	
	Since it's Friday &amp; Christmas where I am, I just wanted to take a
moment and extend my warmest regards to you all during this holiday season.
You all come into my life daily (on digest) and bring me info and laughter
about the greatest machine ever invented every day of the year and I thank
you all for it.

	I'd especially like to thank Thom, Ken, Stephen, George and Steve
(and anyone else I may have overlooked) for all their tireless efforts
keeping this list up and running and best on the net.  You 'volks are
awesome.

	May all your dreams be vintage and gifts be N.O.S.  Have a SAFE and
HAPPY Holiday Season!!  Drive careful everyone!!
