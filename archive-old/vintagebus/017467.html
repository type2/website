I was under the impression that this &quot;tent railing&quot;
was readily available from most RV suppliers....right
Ellis?

Yes and no. Run of the mill RV style &quot;C&quot; channeling
may still be available at your local RV supplier.

There is a specific shape/length/size to the pair of C
channel pieces as used on my (wife's) '67 Westy. Would
assume they are the same on '65-'67 but am not the
guru type to know that exacting batting average and
the stop-start by VIN numbers. Actually don't care
that much...
The specific type of channel pieces that is on our
Westy is secured with smallish bent aluminum
rectangles with a hole drilled through them. The
railing lays along the gutter from the front side.
Small ridges on the back side of this piece isolate
the correct positioning. The rectangle thingies go on
the back side. The rails and the retaining rectangle
zoobies are held together with appropriate sized
screw, washer and nut combos that go through the
pieces and create tension above the rain gutter. No
rain gutter drilling or pop riveting is necessary! OG
channeling was in two pieces to allow for the forward
leg of the Westy roof rack. If these pieces are the
right stuff and they are the last pieces needed for a
&quot;Concourse&quot; ;-) resto then, yeah, $75 plus shipping is
chump change. If we are not talking VW reality and are
talking Reality-reality then $15-20 would be right. In
this ebay world I figure that someone oughta retire on
them.
Some American conversions had one length of the RV &quot;C&quot;
channeling attached approx. one foot above the rain
gutter and drilled right through the roof. What the
heck it is only a VW bus, right?

Concourse -resto-? hahahahaha that I've got to see...
Hornbecker's original deluxe, a 40 mile OG Type I that
I know of or any other nearly new original would be
the thing to beat. Anything done with correct NOS
parts, correct amount of orange peel, factory short
cuts, not over done or under done etc. would be
exciting to see and enjoy~and encourage. If the bar is
raised to encourage improved quality in the VWs (all
types) then I support the concept. I know from only
attempting to do only one (and copping out to
resto-custom) how much of a challenge it is to do it
right. Any one who attempts to do one ought to brace
themselves for hoards of criticism by those who have
never tried. Prepare for one heck of an education and
eventually an appreciation of what you've done.
