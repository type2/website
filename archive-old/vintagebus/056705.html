Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Every day.....well, maybe once a month I take the wife's Ni$$an to work.

That's  approximately 40-50 miles round trip, 15 miles of that are on mountain/canyon roads...3rd gear if you're lucky.  Lots of wind around here too.  The rest of the drive is pretty much crazy So-Cal traffic on the I-15.

I'm gettin mighty close to 14,000 miles on the bus since taking delivery from VanBondo in Feb. of 2001.

Daily drove other buses when I lived in Vegas.

Later,

&gt; 
&gt; how many of you actually DRIVE your bus 
&gt; DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT a 
&gt; honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)?
