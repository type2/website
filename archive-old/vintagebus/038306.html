Hi List,

I checked my parts book and it shows 'bullet' front turn signals in amber as
pn 211 953 161. When I searched the BusDepot on line catalogue for that pn
it returned me a pair of turn signals which were  supposed to fit all the
way to '67.

The WCM catalog does the same. I thought that 'bullets' went the way of the
dodo in '63. Am I correct in this assumption?

Later 

Michael
