Subject: BBB Report &amp; Solar cooking links

I had a great weekend in sunny Lake Havasu. Thanks to all the AZ people that 
made it happen so smoothly. The new location is perfect. Closer to amenities if 
they were needed. I think the campsite is closer to the actual bridge than the 
previous site on the island.  We'll definitely be back! 

A few people were asking about my solar oven. Here's the links below...

The Deluxe sun oven. The profits help third-world nations with solar cooking 
technology. Last weekend it got over 350f in an hour even with the low winter 
sun.

All kinds of links, recipes, plans, etc.

A really low-cost, easy to make and pack cooker...

If there's enough interest we'll try to have a solar cooking contest at Jerome.
