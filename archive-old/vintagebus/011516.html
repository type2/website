I need a new home.  Looking for a sub-hatch camper, older the better. 
Complete and good interior is important, exterior and mechanicals are
not.  Haven't much cash at the moment, but that may change soon.  Also
have parts and buses and hard labor to trade.  

Respond soon or I will submit a lengthy, mundane trip report. :-)

thanks-
shawn
