 i did the mental math and came up with 8- one for each of the six window and 
and two for the back window. as menioned westy's came with an (optional?) cab 
divider curtain rod that follows the curved profile of the cab. you tend to 
see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they got to so 42's they 
petered out
  &gt;&gt;
some westys came with the sliding curtain track around the windsheilds and 
front door windows.  My 65 has it.
