Ok, I started piddling with numbers a few weeks ago, did the in-vs-out
spin checks on my 69s old tranny that i loved the gearing in so much..

and then the 66's tranny went south..further south then i am.  Andy, you
wanna see if it wound up down there?

The classic wrrrmmmppphhhhhCLUNCKthmpthmp and the bus stops moving.
1/2/3/R locked up.  I dont think N is (when my old bug this this, even N
wouldnt move..)  Drove the last 20 or so miles in 4th, smoked a little
clutch, ran a few stop signs..(good thing it was 1.30!)


So anyway.  It happens to turn out that the gearing in my 69 box (rebuilt
~1990) is still stock.  The way it handled 70-80+ (real speed as per radar
detectors..)  i had always firgured, from listening to other 68-72 (73 the
4th changed to a .89 (from .82) and the final went to a 4.857 from 5.375
in 74ish) drivers that it just .had. to be late geared. guess not.


So here is a cleaned up version of my notes....i've not made a descision
n what i am going to do yet.  I .do. know i need to get my speedo
calibrated, as I was paced at 65-70 in a 45 when my speedo was reading
55-60!! (As the nice officer so politely informed me...he also informed
me that unmarked country roads in alabama are 45..and that he doesnt mind
55-60 in a 45, but 65-70 is a nono)


cat gear2
for each gear, there are 2 lines showing speed (mph) at 4000rpm.  The
first uses, sp=(rpm*60)*(dia in miles) with .00126 miles as the diameter.
            --------------------------
             (gear ratio*final drive)

I dont recall where this number came from, but it was either calculated
off of a basic 195/75R14 tire using a formula someone provided me (likely
George Lyle.  I think that is where i got this whole formula, as well.)
OR it was given to me along about the same time as the formula...but i
dont recall.

the second line shows speed at 4000rpm calculated with the Car and Drive
formula that someone (Joel, I think) posted to v_at_l (I suspect) many years
ago.   mph = (rpm * cir) / (gear * final * 88)
cir being circumference in feet ( (2*r*pi)/12 )
I used 6.45 feet for this, using the effective dynamic radius given in the
63-67 Bentley page 4, B-11 (12.32+-.12 inches)

I also calculated the RPM at 70 and 75 mph using variations on both
formula. the first line uses R=S/(60*D/F)  where R=rpm S=speed
D=dia(miles) F=final*gear
The second uses rpm = ((88*g*f)(mph))/cir


My 69 box:
1st     3.80    14.8_at_4k
                14.4
2nd     2.06    27.3
                26.4
3rd     1.26    44.7
                43.3
4th     0.82    68.6
                66.5
R       3.61
Final   5.375
70 =            5310
                4491
75 =            5689
                4812


-----

And now the splitty stuff.

For the 70/75mph calculations i also figured in a rough guess for those
using the 27&quot; offroad 14 inch tires, using the c&amp;d formula and 7.06 feet
for the circumference.

The top line lists the .total. final drive ratio, which is redux*ring and
pinion.   the first column is for 1.26 redux boxes, with a 4.125 final.
the second is the &quot;stock&quot; aug63+ 1500 t2 4.375 final 1.26 boxes. The third
column is using a 3.88 ring and pinion with 1.26 boxes.  The forth is just
there for comparative purposes.  It uses 1.39 boxes (pre 63?) and a 4.125
final.  I might do one with a 4.375x1.39 for the hell of it..anyone want
to see it?

Again, the second line is the car and driver formula, using 6.45ft tires.

Final  5.1975   5.5125  4.8888  5.73
------------------------------------
1  3.8  15.3    14.43   16.3    13.8
        14.8    14      15.8    13.5
2  2.06 28.2    26.6    30      25.6
        27.4    25.8    29.1    24.8
3  1.22 47.7    45      50.7    43.3
        46.2    43.6    49.2    41.9
4  .82  70.9    67      75      64  
        68.8    64.9    74.1    62.4

70 =    3946    4185    3711    4350
        4070    4317    3828    4487
w/ 27&quot;  3719    3944    3497    4100
75 =    4228    4484    3977    4661
        4361    4625    4102    4807
w/27&quot;   3984    4226    3747    4392




Now, if i could get my hands on the hp and torque curve graphs for the
1600sp engines in stock form, as well as some drag data on a late 60s
split...~sigh~

So pick the gearing that allows .your. engine to provide enough power to
move at the speed that you want.  Remember, hp varies across the rpm
range.  You may only have 25-30 hp at 2800-3000 rpm, or you may have more.
See http://www.type2_dot_com/~keen/west/darkness/nodark/other/horse  for a
good description of .why. you need to know how much power your engine
produces before you go messing with things.

If you .dont. know, dont feel like learning, cant understand it, or just
want to guess but you dont like to live with the results of an incorrect
guess, then go stock.  VW paid a lot of engineers good german-engineer
salaries over the years for them to understand this.
