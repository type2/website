Subject: RE: [T2] Back door cargo rubber ?

Many thanks:  We are going to try a &quot;universal&quot; type of seal that is carried
at a couple of stores here in Phoenix--I have used them before for rubber on
my Fridolin,and the cost is around $1.50 a foot--Not a bad savings
!--Especially when my friend who needs the seal is low on cash--uj



Hiya VWStuff,

Pardon me for dispensing unwanted advice.  But I'm gonna do it anyway.  I'm
sure that you can find some low prices for that seal.  But remember that low
prices often go hand-in-hand with low quality.  And that rear cargo hatch
seal is critical.  An ill fitting or low quality seal will allow carbon
monoxide to enter the passenger cabin.  Need I go further?
Your best price for a good seal will most likely be found by doing a little
talking to Ron Salmon.  There's too much to risk here just for the sake of
the lowest price.
