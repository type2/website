&lt;&lt;Hope the
main frame is still good&gt;&gt;

No. It is shot. Hence the question on body removal.

&lt;&lt;oi now you want to do a roof transplant&gt;&gt;

That was his idea from the beginning. I suggested swapping the bodies
because I was unsure of how much it entailed. Nw that I see this isn't as
feasible as , per say, a type 1, we will go back to his idea.

&lt;&lt;sure of course you will keep it forever&gt;&gt;

Me? No. You can look at my webpage and see that I don't keep them forever,
but he is alot different than I. It would greatly surprise me if he ever did
get rid of it.

&lt;&lt;Now hmm, your friend with the nice bod &gt;&gt;

Alright, someone let me live this typo down already! I'm a mechanic in the
army, neither carrying prerequisites for typing.

&lt;&lt;gets this ratty samba&gt;&gt;

Ratty? Since when is any vintage VW considered Ratty? and there is that
Samba again. Based on the responses I got, thsi is wrong, correct?

&lt;&lt;and even though you dont
like bodywork,  you are willing to do all this cut and weld?  &gt;&gt;

I hate bodywork. I despise bodywork. lol. But, there are no limitations to
what I would do for a friend.

&lt;&lt;why not send to
it the metal wiz or someone, or find a nicer bus?&gt;&gt;

I tried talking him into the finding another bus part. He doesn't want to.
He has what he wants and is going to keep it. You think it sounds bad? You
should see the convertible he has been working on for the last year now!
That was bad. As far as sending it off, against my religion. If I can't do
it, it won't get done. Not to my VW's anyway. I'm not sure how he feels
about that, but I know he just can't dump all that money into at once. He is
planning on a 5 yr+resto. A little at a time.

&gt; I am sure someone else has said this, but buses do not have separate bodys
&gt; and pans.   so you cant swap them like you can with a bug.  Depending on
the
&gt; rust of the 21 window,   I am sure you (or your friend) can find repair
&gt; panels    Usually bses have rust in the rockers- that is the bit of the
side
&gt; that curves in.  There are inner and outer rockers.  there are also
&gt; outriggers, and jack point.  and often holes in the front floor.     Hope
the
&gt; main frame is still good.  Sunroof buses also have sub floor pans for
&gt; structiral strength, which may be in doubtful condition.   You, I mean
your
&gt; friend,  will find there are a lot more pieces to a bus than a bg,
especially
&gt; a samba bus.   If you get a copy of the Transporter Workshop Manual 1963
&gt; edition now back in print and available through Bentley, there is a nice
&gt; section show the bits of metal folded together to make a bus.
&gt;
&gt; oi now you want to do a roof transplant.
&gt;
&gt;    sure of course you will keep it forever.
&gt;
&gt; Now hmm, your friend with the nice bod gets this ratty samba, and he wants
&gt; this done to it, then decided to do this or  that, and even though you
dont
&gt; like bodywork,  you are willing to do all this cut and weld?  why not send
to
&gt; it the metal wiz or someone, or find a nicer bus?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I thought samba was the deluxes (21 or 23 window buses).    heard the
&gt; brits call them that.

&gt; Greetings all! Walt here again. I had to change my email for this group
&gt;
&gt; being as how AOL6 insists on putting html in all emails. Anyways, on to my
&gt;
&gt; question
&gt;
&gt;     My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too
&gt;
&gt; bad(needs the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot),
&gt;
&gt; but after I finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are
shot.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't
&gt;
&gt; think I need to explain what I am getting at. I swap pans on type 1's all
&gt;
&gt; the time, but it doesn't appear to be as easy on a bus. Any ideas????
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; P.S.-What exactly is a Samba? I originally thought it referred to a 21
&gt;
&gt; window or the like but lately I have seen it when referring to trucks as
&gt;
&gt; well. Is this like an option package or something? lol. Seriously, I dont
&gt;
&gt; know and was just curious. Vote me in for stupid question of the week, I
&gt;
&gt; dont care! Thansk again!
