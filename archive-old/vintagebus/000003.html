Subject: [VB] fried egg inner lens color minutia - results
Message-ID: &lt;0.15c7d7cf.255c30ea_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Stephan Robertson, Jerry &amp; Melissa Jess, ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com, Robert Davis, 
Split List:

Recording results for the archives for question &quot;What color was the front 
turn signal inner lens for 1962 and 1963 model year USA spec splitties?&quot;

3 out of 3 responses from the vintagebus list confirm that the answer is 
CLEAR.  Actually it seems that the lenses were one piece and did not have any 
second inner lens (which was added in 1964 in the amber / yellow color).  
Stephan mentions they were one peice and I confirm this at looking at my 63.  
Further confirmation if I am reading the parts manual someone :) sent me:

211 953 161/2 A = left/right USA and Italy up to chassis 1144281 (1964 model 
year) - no mention of color and M code 24

211 953 161/2 B = left/right all splitties from chassis 1144281 (1964 model 
year) - color is YELLOW

Thanks to all who responded, Tom Good in Vermont

&gt; I believe:  
&gt;  The early(62-63) ones are clear.  They are clear on my '63.  
&gt;  The later ones are actually two pieces; clear outter, amber inner.

&gt; looked seriously at a 63 panel camper conversion. It had clear lenses. I
&gt;  think the amber came in 64 when the euro spec went fisheye.
