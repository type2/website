--------------------------------------------

-   My DC is almost done being painted, I am getting kind of excited being this is going to be the first TOTALLY restored bus I have ever owned. I have reconditioned, repainted, etc. etc. other buses, but this will be the first one that I am totally doing.
   Once back from KCW I will start to assemble it. I am installing a 67 front beam and a big nut trans, want the bigger brakes. 
  My goal is to have a 70's Cal Look bus, but not going as anal as mister Mayes (thanks for the cool wheels!).
