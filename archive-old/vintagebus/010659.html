&lt;&lt; on my 67/61 swap, to simplify pullign parts can i just swap everything 
&gt;from the arms out from teh 67 to 61, or are the front beams different ID's in 
the bore?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Do yourself a big favor and just install the 1967 front beam into your 
pre-1964 bus.  The 1965 and later bus front beams use needle bearings of 
bigger diameter instead of the smaller reamed bushings that the 1964 and 
earlier buses use.  Needle bearings are far longer lasting than bushings and 
stronger.   Eric&amp;Barb
