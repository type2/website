was writ:


I was about to work on my timing, and I noticed that the fan belt was
slipping. So I took out one shim, not it is tight but not too tight(I don't
think).

i did a lot of looking under the engine, and couldn't realy find any obvious
problems.

Then when I went to look at the engine again, I noticed the whole thing looks
as though it has rotated about the longitudinl axis of the bus, about 2
degrees. Now I don't know if it was always like that or not, so I wasn't sure
if there was any remedy.

Any way I tried running it again today, no oil light. Took it for a spin,still
no light. Tried the highway, still no light. I think everything is ok, I guess
it was the loose fanbelt, although that doesn't really make sense to me.

 ==  = = =
do you think maybe it was the generator light that came on?

once I was driving my 59 bus ...  summer of 91,   we were coming back to the
west coast from the east coast and in Wyoming the oil light cam eon..  so I
stopped,  oiil there,   checked all kinds of stuff.   Eventually kept
driving.  wasn't hot or nothing.    Some hours later, on hwy 6 in Nevada,
shortly after dark,  the bus  hesiates, coughs and dies.    I pull over, and
we camp right there.    middle of the desert, lovely stars.   Push start it
in the morning.   yes, it was the genertor light and the brushes were worn
out, went to Tonopah, bought new brushes, and push started it again and the
light went out.  didn't have to push start it after that.
