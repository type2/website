Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW


_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_ Hi John    First new &quot;car&quot; I ever bought was
a dodge van in 1972.The start of the custom van era.If
anyone in a van any van wihout windows(panels were
cool because you had room to paint Tarzan or whatever
on the side..hahahaha) went by all were waving all the
time...It was soooo cool to be part of that.When it
got to be more and more people in dealer bought
customs the waving stopped and so did the fun.Any
smuck could plunk down the $$$ and drive out &quot;Cool&quot; I
dont think so!!! I think it was sad to see that end.I
am sure there are groups in eastern Idaho(a joke
folks) or somewhere that still drive vans with ladies
on dragons flying in the air but there is only one
first time for everything.We should be glad that any
of the others wave at all.I mean the rest of them out
there are just traffic.Stay happy and wave only at
splitty owners(another joke people) Oh...my bus mini
resto is moving very slow.So far it's a clean-o ...clean..clean...Later

Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
