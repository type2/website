Subject: &quot;rebuilt&quot; junk once again
Message-ID: &lt;37251B0F.2BF8_at_HiWAAY_dot_net&gt;

Today I got my rebuilt spindles from California Import Parts, made by
Wolfgang International.

I'm really turned off.

Little things:

everything painted over, including the rubber seals
paint in the link pin holes (let the customer scrape it out)
sandblasted sealing surface for grease seal (&quot;braindead&quot; comes to mind)

Unforgivable:

The inside bearing seat on one spindle is excessively worn and way out
of tolerance
(yes, it looks so bad that I checked and compared it to factory spec
wear limit)

Now I will have to send that garbage back.
It seems that some rebuilders think a sandblasted part is a rebuilt part
and customers are to stupid to notice anyway.

Disillusioned once again,

Martin Peitz
