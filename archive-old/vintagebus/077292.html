Subject: Bus camp at Bonnaroo

Hey Y'all,
Since it's friday, I just checked out the line-up for
Bonnaroo '04 in tennessee June 11-13.
Included are: The Dead, Bob Dylan, Dave matthews,
Willie Nelson, Gillian welch, Trey Anastacio, and
MORE!!!
So who wants to head up a &quot;bus camp&quot; for the event.
Basically we would all have to meet up before going
into the event grounds so we can park together. Last
year it was awesome, we parked our buses in a square
formation and had a nice little private &quot;courtyard&quot; in
the middle amongst the other madness!
Hey Snoopy, can we resurrect that Cara-bus list? If
you're too busy, i can see what I can do.

=====
Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
