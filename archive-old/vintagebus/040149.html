Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus


Phil of VTO won the bus so at least its CA bound.  It was full of soggy 
raffle tickets last I saw, but it was well worth the .50 cents it took to 
win it.  Great job on the paint and interior ABC!

&gt;I haven't heard anybody yet say anything about the raffle bus.  Who won it?
&gt;Did they raise a good amount of money?  How did the bus look?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I have some pics, mainly caravan and ppl coming over mingus on Sun.  I 
&gt;just
&gt; &gt;woke up and now have to go to work.  I drove straight through yest and 
&gt;got
&gt; &gt;home at abt 3am.  Had a great time.  Can't figure out why they separated 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt;rack and ladder though.  Will post the pics when I get a chance.  Anyone 
&gt;get
&gt; &gt;any pics of the slow drags?
&gt; &gt;
