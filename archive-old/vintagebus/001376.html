Subject: Any Weber Gurus out there?

I wanted to know if anyone out there is familiar with the 40IDF's enough to
tell me what size of jets I should run for 1,000' ASL?

My carbs currently have 50 idle, 160 (main I'm guessing???) in the F11
emulsion tube.  Before at idle I was running stock heads and it tended to
flood out a little bit but I'm wondering since I'll be flowing more at idle,
if I shouldn't put the 55 idle jets back in?  Also, I'm pretty sure my main
jet will have to be bumped up some to prevent a lean mixture.  Anyway,
Ronnie and kymco is gone today and so I'm gonna have to wait and call him
tomorrow.  I was hoping someone on here might know what I should do?  These
valves are HUGE in this head and with the J-tubing on and the ratio rockers,
this baby is gonna flow.  Were talking crappy mileage and all kinds of
power.  My kind of dubbing!

Thanks for the help...
