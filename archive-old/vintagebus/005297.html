Hi Gang,

I'm trying to get &quot;Hank&quot; ('62 standard) on the road for the first time since
I bought
him in August. The front brakes were stuck so I thought I'd pull
off the wheels and take a look at what was going on in there. I'm
a newbie so I am meticulously following along in the idiot book, and
I'm expecting the inboard bearings to drop into my strategically placed
rag ( per Muir ). They didn't drop, and are still attached to the spindles.
How do I get those little hummers off of there? The Bentley says to use
the special bearing puller tool. Do I need to get one of these?

So I'm checking out the brake scene and it appears to me that it's a
rusty, gunky mess in there and I should pull everything off get new
cylinders
(since then current ones are rusted solid) and while I'm at it put some new
bearings in clean up and paint the backing plates that kind of stuff. when I
get to the VW FLAPS the friendly parts duuude tells me he has the inboard
bearings but he's got to order the outboard ones, and by the way, the new
German cylinders are 28.55 each for the left side and 25.00 for the right
side. &quot;Hmm, ..&quot; I say, &quot; I guess I'll take the bearings and get back to you
on the
cylinders..&quot; So he hands me a bag with two boxes in it and rings up the
sale.
I can't help but notice that the bag has two different brands of bearings in
it
one FAG, and one SKF. Not wanting to look like a dork in front of the duuude
I take my new mis-matched bearings home knowing that I better check a couple
of things out with you guys..

1) Are mis-matched bearings OK ?
2) Should I try to find used cylinders or should I fork over the dinero for
the new
     ones?

Thanks,
