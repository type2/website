Dear VB,

I've been to a few events, looking around at the types of busses. As an 
owner myself, I felt that it would be nice to join a bus list to keep up 
with some of the latest sales and information. Not to mention to ask around 
if I had any questions.

The main part of the above paragraph is that I joined this list because I 
found it the most appealing to my needs. However, I never thought I'd join a 
bus list that is bus owners bashing bus owners. The way the past few emails 
have been looking, I find that the college I go to isn't even this bad on 
bashing other people with the same interests. I though VW people were the 
coolest ever. Shall I stand to be corrected? I hope not.

Seeking the truth behind [VB],
Josh
