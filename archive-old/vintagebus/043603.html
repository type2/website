&gt;Anyone know of any issues involved in bringing a bus into California 
&gt;from Canada, eh?

In 1996 I was working in Kansas City and it looked like several of
us were going to stay in LA (Fullerton) for six months to a year
as part of the job.  We asked about bringing our cars to California
and at the time, I believe you had to pay some kind of &quot;smog impact
fee&quot; of a few hundred dollars and pass the sniffer test for your
car.  I think the sniffer spec was the federal (not California)
spec for the year of your car.  You didn't have to upgrade your
federal smog equipment to California smog equipment.  All of these
tests and fees were over and above the normal registration and
licensing fees.  This probably depends on the year of the Bus in
question...if it's old enough to not need a smog check, it may not
need all this.

Interesting things to smuggle inside the Bus, that will attract various
degrees of attention from the Man...

* booze - especially stuff you can't get in the US
* prescription drugs - at half the US price
* Rush albums
* toilets - US now specs water-saving toilets that unfortunately
    don't work.  In Canada you can still get the water-wasting kind
    that work fine.
* charged batteries and/or hydroelectric plants
