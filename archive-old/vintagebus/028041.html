 Why are all the early parts &quot;ribbed&quot; or &quot;grooved&quot; ie bumpers, inner 
 door handles, semaphores, etc.   Is there some Freudian gag that

Probably for the same reason they call the 55-61 blinky front turn signals 
&quot;nipples&quot;.    Though it seems like the guys don't like to use grease when 
assembling things, they just don't understand the importance of lube.
