Hey wow...  I'm back after 2 and 1/2 years hiatus....  I originally began when
this list wuz at vanagon_at_ lenti.something.  I even have the original sticker
(you sticker you brought 'er).  That must be worth sumpthin by now!
Thanks to Ron VanNess for keeping occasionally connected with all you nuts.

Just an update, I've been drivin' my '65 21 window delicious daily until this
past winter.  I needed to do a top-end on the dual port and just never got
around to doing it.  Mean while, i'm a rebuilding another to go in
Foo-neck-betty (as dubbed by my then three-year old) and she should be toolin'
down the road w/i the next couple-a-weeks....In the meantime, I'm driving my
'63 benz or '76 Honda bike...

I've got a request (already) ...  I'm Sandy Eggo bound in July to give a talk
at Coastal Zone '99 but will be going abit early (22nd).  I would like to rent
a type 2 to head down to Baja (prolly Ensenada) for about 4-5 daze of surfing.
 Anyone with any leads?  Youse can e-mail me directly..

peace,

-christian
