Subject: Let There Be Light!!!!!!!!

Tonight for the first time since 1979 ,the lights on my 63 15 window lit up
. Well not ALL of them, just the dash lights and the low beam headlights but
its a start. the guy I got it from cut the power wires that connect to the
starter when he pulled the motor and starter, so now I have to repair all of
that.  I have to get a storage unit this week to clear out my garage and
then I  will be moving the 63 in to start the clean up. I have located a 40
horse that has been sitting in a dudes garage for the last 20 years. he said
it came from a bug during an engine upgrade and that it ran when it was
pulled. we will find out.  I will be installing a ball joint front beam and
adding disk brakes soon. I know that wont sit well with some of you but
after the demise of my single cab due to not stopping fast enough I will
have disks on all of my driver busses from now on.

 I cant help but just look at it. I love this new bus feeling, its like
falling in love all over again,=)
Later folks,
 Bryan
