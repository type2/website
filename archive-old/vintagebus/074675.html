Subject: Re: [VB] Stuck Tie rod end

...ok if all that is correct. is this tie rod the style that will not
adjust? if so that may be the problem. On my bus the drivers side is 3
pieces. a rod in the middle and 2 ends that have threaded ends that
allow you to adjust. but the other side is not adjustable, is this
perhaps the end you are trying to get off?...



You are correct the non-adjustable side.....  Do they not come off?


TIA


Bart
