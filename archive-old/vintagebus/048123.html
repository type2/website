best way , That I have found to adjust the timing is to use a static light to 
get it close and then to adjust it by ear . be careful to not advance it to 
far  !!!

a staticlight is a simple test light when properly hooked up to the 
distributor 
and the coil and when the points make contact it causes the light to blink 
and thus you know when you have achived spark in cylinder number one
