&lt;&lt; Why does my engine run so hot??? I am assuming that the dealer installed 
the correct fuel pump diaphram spring and the correct air correction jet for 
the carb.&gt;&gt; 
Hi WKO,
1.  You could be running too high of RPMs for it to properly cool.  Our's 
seem to be happier with 1,500 thru 3,000 RPM and in extreme outside 
temps/hills/loads 2,800 RPM really helps keep it below the top of the 
180-210F oil temp range we prefer.
2.  Your carb could be jetted incorrectly.  Should have a bigger main jet 
than stock 36HP.  Assuming just makes an ass out of you and me!  ;-)
3.  Running an extractor exhaust will lean out the mixture more and is not 
really needed unless you RPM way over 4,000 RPM alot or are running a very 
large big bore engine compared to the designed stock cc of the muffler system.

&lt;&lt;What other mods can I do to make the engine run a little cooler? &gt;&gt;
1.  Bigger later cooling fan.  You could even install a DP 33 thru 35mm 
inside measurement wide fan.
2.  Install a 356 Porshe oil cooler that has more surface area.
3.  Install a better quality aftermarket 36 HP style fan shroud with dog 
house cooler setup.  This will cool the oil better and lower the #3 cylinder 
temp so as to cause less chance of exhaust valve coming apart and destroying 
the engine.  We recently came across 36HP engine tin from Brazil that has a 
round tube thru the forward engine tin for a doghouse cooler on a 36 HP 
engine!
4.  Modify #3 so as to accept a type 4 cooler which is 40% bigger than a 
stock dog house cooler.
5.  Install a earlier 25HP lower pulley that has a larger OD so as to speed 
up the cooling fan a bit.
