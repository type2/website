 Why is Hoover credited for VW part 113-117-323, Sealing Frame?
 
 To my knowledge, he did not invent this part.

I think it not because he invented it (he didn't) but he informed many people
about it, and as the source of info for many about it somehow got connected in
some minds with the part.  Call it whatever you want.     If you call it the
little sealing frame around the doghouse cooler I think people will know what
you mean.
