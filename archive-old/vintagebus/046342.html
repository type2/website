thanks for the input.  While I would miss my baywindow, I wouldn't be 
splitting my spare cash between two buses.  It has been a real trooper over 
the last few years taking every beating I could throw it's way.

  How about the 66 carrying loads?  I DJ and occasionally have to carry 
unbelievably heavy PA speakers to gigs in my bus.  I have heard that the 
earlier trannys are actually better for pulling loads.
