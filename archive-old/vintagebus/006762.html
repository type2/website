that's probably because the drums weren't turned and the arc of the shoes
was off. When I turn my drums we measure the run out and sometimes it's only
a few thousands but I turn them till tru. In the old days after trueing
(sounds better then turning) the drums we would also rearc the shoes, but
due to our EPA it's almost imposable to find someone with a shoe arcer.
Lucky we have a big rig truck shop down the street from my shop and they re
pad shoes there (riveted) and have an arc grinding machine. 


ronnie, all my buses stop on a quarter, till the brakes get hot

Most of the used shoes I've looked at had wear in the first inch of
the leading edge....
