As I finish up the metal work on the 64 SC project it becomes more apparent 
that buying someone elses half done project is the hard way to go. The small 
bags of misc. hardware were of course not includes in the purchase.

What I am looking for is a parts catalog or listing that shows and identifies 
all of the small parts and their locations. I will need seals, grommets, 
hardware and even some of the assemblies (hatch struts, etc.). But first I have 
to identify what is truly missing!

Any and all help will be gratefully appreciated.
