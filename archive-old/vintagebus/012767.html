These automotive engines of ours . .

The magic number is 3600 rpm . . that's what they
are designed for . . . that is the running speed

The 3600 rpm is derived from 60 cycle per second
electrical current . .

These engines were originally built to replace an
electric motor or drive machines that were designed
for either/or  . . . .

It's still that way . . you can come up with an odd-ball
rpm but where you gonna get an alternator . .?

Engine performance is plotted on graph paper for various
rpm thru the max rpm and these form curves on the graph.

We talk about the &quot;torque curve&quot; . . the &quot;horsepower curve&quot;
and the &quot;fuel efficiency curve&quot;

Talk about torque . . while torque is torque, not all
horsies are created equal . .

Torque is a force on the end of a lever . . 1 pound exerted
on a lever 1 foot long is a &quot;ft-lb&quot;, a torque unit . .

In our case, horsepower is defined as &quot;rpm X torque divided
by 5252 . .

The little type1 VW engine is rated for about 50 hp and
can be &quot;improved&quot; to 100 hp  . .

I used to use these Cummins 4V71's that were rated for
about 70 hp . . it's about 4 times the size and weight
of our type 1 . .

Then I've heard of these switch engine engines that are
rated at some number like 100 horse at 1000 rpm ..

That puppy is as big as . . a switch engine . . !  :-)

The engine is maybe 20 ft long . .

You want torque, you gotta have cubes . .

Electric motors have the ability of producing 3 times
as much torque at stall speed as they do at normal running.

You want to replace an electric motor with a gas engine,
multiply by three . . a 3 horse to replace the electric
1 horse . .

Our small wonder type1 delivers 72 ft-lb at 2000 rpm per Bentley.
There is a second value in there . . 18.7 ft-lb at 3000 rpm

That's more a hook than a curve . . still . . max torque is
not the place to be . . that's where the engine does the most work
at the slowest speed  . . most work  means most heat . .
slow speed means slow evacuation of hot exhaust . . more heat passed
to engine . .

You think this is boring . . let me  tell you where the magic &quot;60&quot;
comes from . . . . :-)

It's a Phoenecian packaging scheme . . . .  :-)

This is just how I remember it and I warn you I was drunk at the
time . . :-)

I was in this bar in Macedonia . . and this thrice-cursed Phoenecian
is regaling me with the cleverness of these numbers .

I am listening to this drivel because I am a member of his crew . .

The Tuscarora I . . 14 decks and a straw bottom . .

The Phoneys own the ships . . that bring the  goods . . . they
are very suspicious . . and they want to weigh and measure every
damn thing around and the latest outrage . . they are writing it
down in these mud pies for posterity . .

Thus the term &quot;thrice-cursed&quot; . . . everybody hates them . . :-)

Has to do with how you stack oranges on a counter . . seven is a
natural with 1 in middle and 6 around . . 5 is on the end of your
hand . . now 12 somethings can be divided by 3 or 4 or 2 . .
twelve has 5 and 7 in it . . just tricks . .

That was the packaging deal . . they would only sell these things
in lots of twelve because they fit in  the box that way . .

A hand of twelves is another almost natural . .

So 2, 3 , 5, 7, 12 and 60 are numbers bandied about by shop-keepers
and thrice-cursed phoenecians . . .

This shows up at the palace when the kitchen slaves start using it.

This is all stuff you can do in your head while dealing with irate
camel-jockeys . .

The Military was a natural . . people think of Genghis Kahn as
being a conqueror . . think about feeding, clothing and
moving armies when you can't even count . . :-)

It's a continuous debate as to who invented fractions . .
I tend to think is was women . . as in &quot;give me half&quot; but the
Military is big on dividing things too . . and pretty much own
the word &quot;quarters&quot;. . . .

Litle by little  . . the priests picked up on it and we ended up
with twelve deities and seven days and twelve month calendars
and Wednesday is Wodens day and Friday is for Frida . .

This was all before the Scotch even invented rocks . .

It was the Sailors Union that got the Twelve Deities relegated to
stand-by . . used to be a  lot more than twelve back in the old
days . . .

I'm getting ahead of myself here . . maybe not . .

We used to get lost . . a lot . . and it was never that fat phoenecian's
fault . . n o . . . it was some God or other doing it to us, says he.

Being lost is not so bad . . . being found at the wrong speed is
what's bad . . like you're scudding along thru this fog bank and
find land . .  :-)

This is where the phrase &quot;crying over spilled beer&quot; came from.
And &quot;foundering&quot; . .

The F.P. is up on the poop proclaiming he has once again brought
us safely to shore . . it is our fault if we didn't anticipate
his &quot;back oars&quot; command . .

We were sincere as any sailors in learning all the curses but when you
got 18 or 20 gods . . we're so busy swapping curses, we don't have
time to pull an oar . .

Even words . . we'd come in port and there's all these  new words
to memorize . . didn't have it all layed out in some book for us
like you whippy snappies have it . . :-) not even a mud pie . .

Shipping was paralyzed . . so the priests all got together and said
we could just have one god . .

We still got lost but we made better time . .
and now we just cursed the fat phoenecian . . :-)

Later on some wuss got tired of getting lost and invented a clock
and a compass . . wasn't us . .

The compass is it's own trip, being 60 times 60 . . :-)

Rosy, the bar-maid took pity on my callow youth and explained
how the other men would laugh at me if I came back to the ship
with money . . which is why she was going thru the
passed out phoenicians pockets , ,reluctantly, she took my funds
also, after much pleading from me . . nice girl . . . :-)

Said I reminded her of her poor lost brother . . . :-)

You may doubt the veracity of this tale  . . but sailors still
curse . . and a Rosy still takes your money down at &quot;Neptunes Folly&quot;. :-)
