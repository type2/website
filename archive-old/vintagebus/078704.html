. actually rivets and bolts.

 

2 favors please to all those that might find themselves with a spare
moment.

 

1.  measurements and descriptions of original vent window latch rivet.
yes, open up your vent windows and look underneath the frame where the
rivet is.  Is it flat?.... or roundish?  Next, take your calipers and
measure the diameter; is it 5, 6, 7 mm?     

       I think I found a source for these rivets (places like msc don't
carry metric sized rivets) . the min order is a 1000 so I want to make
sure I get the right part!!!

 

 

2.  next, Jon Furst brought to my attention that splash pan bolts have
an early/late head size. 9 or 8 mm.  Seems 5mm bolt head sizes changed
in the same '59 era that the 14mm headed 8mm bolts switched to a 13mm
head.  So, all members with splash pans, go out and see if an 8 or 9 mm
wrench fits on the bolts holding your splash pans right by the engine
compartment.  They should be kamax 5D.

Thanks!
