I don't like to run my tires till bald, when I get to 30 percent or so of
the tread I will replace them, use them as around town tires on another bus
and use the new ones on my cruiser.

Hmmm, something doesn't add up...half tread left at
34k and only gonna get another 10k out of them. 
Ronnie, are you planning on doing a lot of burnouts
with the 60 DD in the next few months?   &lt;vbg&gt;
