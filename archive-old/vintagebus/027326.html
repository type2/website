I've been to every auto parts store and any wholesaler I can find around here
and nobody has it nor can they order it.  I took a night specifically for the
search of it...and that night was wasted as nobody has the stuff.
I found Hypoid 90 gear oil in little bottles that are used for marine purposes
though... whats this stuff?


&gt; When I realized that ALL my local flaps now carried nothing but GL5 tranny
&gt; oil, I went on a panicky search at the local wholesalers...
