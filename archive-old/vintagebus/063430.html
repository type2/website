Subject: Re: Here the h*ll is it / door rubber

&gt;the rubber profile in my picture is correct until you get into the 60s. I
&gt;have been told VW changed the profile of that upper piece you spoke of,
&gt;around 63 and then again in 67.

My '64 Standard was built November 1963 and I think it has the original
front door rubber as it's pretty beat.  I can take some photos of it if
it would be helpful to figure this out.

I looked through the changes for '62-'65 in the Doliwa book and couldn't
nail down a better date.
