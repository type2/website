Hey, I was flipping the channels on the TV the other
night...I came to the priview Channel and the movie
&quot;Backdraft&quot; had just started. I could'nt find anything
else worth watching so I figured I'd watch Backdraft.
Well, at the very beginning..the Firemen were heading
to a fire when low and behold..they pass a beautiful
67 Pop top(I think it was a 67)..A bunch of hippies
are near it waving to the fire truck....right then, I
knew it was a good movie..:-)

Peace,

Greg

ps..I'm new to the splitty world..someone emailed me
and said I better clamp my hoses. Does that mean I
should replace the clamps on there now..or what?
