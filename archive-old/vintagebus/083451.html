Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] bending brake lines

 I ordered the full brake line kit from type2parts_dot_com(don't think it's the 
same as the bus depot kit) for my deluxe and was happy with the quality. 
Much better IMHO than the 2 piece long lines some other places are selling. 
I unbent mine from the shipped shape(bent in two places to fit a long box) 
and bent it to fit the bus by hand using no tools, other than a pair of 
pliers(for leverage) to hold the fitting(don't hold the line with pliers!) 
when I had to do a bend on a short piece torward the end. Go slow and take 
your time, using the original as a template. I didn't think it was nearly as 
bad to bend it as I thought it would be, and others had told me it would be. 
Installing it the bus was worse than I expected.
