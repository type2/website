Subject: Re: [VB] Help with Idetifying my Camper

Hi Britt,
Thanks for your speedy response.  I have a photo that I downloaded from the
web that shows a close-up photo of a '67 roadrunner tag.  This photo also
shows the state of California tag, like my bus has.  This Roadrunner tag has 4
rivets, one in each corner, while my tag has 2, one in each side.  Also the
Roadrunner tag in the photo has the numbers stamped along the bottom edge,
where my numbers are stamped in a line right in the center.

I suppose that tags could look different on different days.  This part of the
mystery, and makes it a real quest to find out who did my camper interior.

Thank you very much for your imput.  I hope I can return your kindness some
day.

Regards,
edr.

&gt; Edward I have a Roadrunner and it sounds like the same tags as I have. I
&gt; have no interior but it was a roadrunner because it had a picture of a
&gt; Roadrunner on the front doors and said California Roadrunner under the
&gt; picture.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; You all probably get this request daily, but here goes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a 1967 Kombi, and was told that it was a Sundial
&gt; &gt; Camper.  I was familiar enough with Campers, having had many Bugs and
&gt; &gt; going to lots of shows to know by the wood in the interior that it
&gt; &gt; wasn't a Westy.  There are no Sundial tags on my interior, such as on
&gt; &gt; the Icebox.  I don't have a fold-up back seat either.  People who seem
&gt; &gt; to know say that 1967 Sundials were different than other years.  I can
&gt; &gt; tell you that the Icebox door matches other Sundials that I've seen.
&gt; &gt; The wood is real cheap, and seems to get it's wood grain from decals or
&gt; &gt; contact paper, which is peeling off.  There is a valance of thin wood
&gt; &gt; around the inside roof line, right below the paneled headliner.  One guy
&gt; &gt; told me that Sundials have pie shaped cutouts in this strip of wood
&gt; &gt; about every 12 inches or so, so since mine doesn't it's probably an EZ
&gt; &gt; or a Roadrunner.  The back cabinets, the ones over the engine, are real
&gt; &gt; strange too.  They each have a 10 inch square sliding door, with a
&gt; &gt; little round metal finger hole to open it.  The opening is rounded on
&gt; &gt; the corners.  What is so strange is that on each side cabinet is a piece
&gt; &gt; of 1/2 inch plywood sitting on end.  These pieces are about 6-8 inches
&gt; &gt; long, and look like a shelf would rest on the surface of each.  On the
&gt; &gt; forward corner of each piece is a little plastic roller, as though a
&gt; &gt; shelf or a seat, (part of a fold up bed?) should rest on it.  The
&gt; &gt; cabinet door pulls are all copper in color, with points on the ends that
&gt; &gt; attach to the cabinets.    The Icebox has the water tank in the back of
&gt; &gt; the unit, the side that backs up to the back of the passenger side.
&gt; &gt; There is a spice rack on the inside of the rear cargo door.  It has 3-4
&gt; &gt; shelves, with 3 holes in the top to hold cups.  There are two metal tags
&gt; &gt; on the outside, just below the forward cargo door.  One is the green
&gt; &gt; State Of California tag, and the other is an aluminum tag about 2&quot;X3&quot;,
&gt; &gt; attached with a rivet on each side of the tag.  Whatever had been
&gt; &gt; painted on the tag, such as Sundial, or Riviera, or whatever, has been
&gt; &gt; scratched off.  The numbers across the center read 1967
&gt; &gt; SN          356.  The side windows are pop-outs on the front and back
&gt; &gt; window on each side, with a louvered window in the center on the drivers
&gt; &gt; side, and in the rear cargo door on the passenger's side.  There are
&gt; &gt; three windows on each side.  I checked the M-Codes on this bus.  They
&gt; &gt; showed a walk-thru interior, 6 pop-out windows, and seat belt mounts.
&gt; &gt; The port of entry for this bus was Los Angeles.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry that this is so long winded.  I'm hoping that someone on this site
&gt; &gt; can help me identify this bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance for your help,
