Hey folks,

No offense to anyone out there with post 67 bus questions, but there is a list
dedicated to those vehicles.  Two benefits to posting to the correct list.  1.
LESS unwanted traffic on this list.  2.  You might just get your question
answered by people knowledgeable in those busses (68-91).  I'm sorry, but you'll
have to find it on your own...check out www.type2_dot_com.

Thanks for being considerate to the others on the list.

Steve

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; I have the opportunity to purchase a 79 Westy in very good condition.
&gt; However, the only drawback I can see is the automatic transmission.  Has
&gt; anyone have kind words of wisdom about this?  The engine is a 2.0 and appears
&gt; to run well, it is a bit out of time but no worries there.  I am just
&gt; fascinated with how well this camper has been maintained and would be willing
&gt; to purchase it for that reason alone.  Asking price is $1800.
&gt; How difficult would it be to find and install a standard transmission, or is
&gt; this not necessary?   Thanks for any and all input
&gt;
