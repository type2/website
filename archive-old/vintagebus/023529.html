Subject: Elephant ear mirrors or round ones? Question... ????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone. This may seem like a lunkheaded question, but, what is the 
preferred mirror on a splitty bus, elephant ear style or round? I see enough 
of both and I can't figure out which one. What does everyone on this list 
have or prefer? It is also my understanding that the elephant ear style was 
an option, right? I have the round mirrors myself but have been pondering the 
other style...hmmmm...just curious what everyone else thinks. Thanks everyone 
and take care.


        Best wishes,
