Subject: [arizonabusclub] Mt. Pinal (Globe) Campout May 5,6,&amp;7

--- Anyone wishing to caravan, can join us at the QT gas station on
Mesa Drive just south of the 60 freeway - leaving at 9 am. Easy
directions: Take the 60 east to Miami/Globe and turn right at the 188
intersection.  Turn right at Russell Rd and take it to the top of the
mountain. The map on the newsletter shows a slightly different route,
going through Globe &amp; coming in the east side. Both get you there.

I called the Forest Service last week and fires are still allowed in
the campground fire pits. Bring your own water as there is none
available up the hill. While you can't really see any trees from the
highway in town, there are plenty so bring your hammocks to relax in!  

If you enjoy paintball, bring your stuff and join my boys and Eli in
decorating each other.  Some pics from last year are in the photos
section if you want to see what's up there.
