Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet Metal for 65' bus- more questions 

Just recieved some rocker and floor sections from bus boys today....They are
the same orange panels as wol west and appear to be good quality...Service
was prompt and prices were great,esp with the 15% discount that expires
today....BTW I think that a used heater tube would be the only way to
go...lots of good used ones in the south...

Still grindin' on that 56 Kombi

Everyone have a great and bussy new year,

&gt; Hi! New guy on the list (reactivated '67 13-window Deluxe in Phila. Pa.
&gt; area)...
&gt;
&gt; I was distressed to read the negative reports on body panel quality, since
I
&gt; just made the commitment to fix the body right. Lots of questions: Is it
the
&gt; whole group's concensus that BFY's panels are best? What variety does The
&gt; Bus Depot sell (they're local for me, but seem more focused on later
buses)?
&gt; Schofield in the U.K. seems to offer pieces that the others do not -- does
&gt; he sell to the U.S.? It seems only RMMW offers a heater tube in the U.S.,
&gt; but it's only 36&quot; long and very expensive -- what's the deal? (I need the
&gt; whole straight tube, plus the angled piece just ahead of it that comes
down
&gt; from over the front beam.)
&gt;
&gt; Finally, is anyone on the list from the Philadelphia area? Know of any
shops
&gt; in the area that have done bus body restoration work?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt;
&gt; -- Rich
