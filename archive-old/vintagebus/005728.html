Hi!

I'm stoked that I finally received my white Deluxe steering wheel and horn
button, and a clock.  I apologize in advance to those who would not approve
of my bastardizing my '67 Kombi, but this is probably going to be my only
bus for a while and I wants to do this.  The only dash cutting I'll be doing
is to install the clock.

The steering wheel is pretty good, but could definitely benefit from
restoration....has anyone done this, and can you recommend a good kit?  The
horn button has some crazing on the clear, and is a little worse for wear,
but hey....that's what I get for giving the one that I saved for years to a
hippie in a bus that I said &quot;hi&quot; to and noticed that he didn't have one at
all!

The clock is a six-volt, and needs glass, the outer chrome piece, and some
serious tlc.  As far as I can tell at this point, the clock mechanism works,
but I don't know if the electrics do.  So of all things, I'm looking for the
chrome doo-dad that holds the glass in....anyone got one?

I paid $130 for the lot.

Gene
