Subject: where to buy parts
Date: Sun, 1 Apr 2001 22:29:53 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

  I have a ton of parts I need for me '67 Deluxe restoration.  I'm in
northern calif, and the only parts I have purchased so far have been body
parts and safaris (from Alan Schofield &amp; CE).   Being in the West I have
considered purchasing from Bus Boys, Wolfgang Intl, Wolfsbufg West, and West
Coast Metrics.  In general can anyone recommend (or recommend against) any
of these businesses as far as quality and customer service is concerned?

Thank you,
HK
