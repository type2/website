It's the same as the cab divider ashtray. There IS a
(flexible thick tarpaper-like) hardboard back on the
middle seat. Covered in Vinyl. The ashtray mounts by
sliding into a chrome mounting plate which is attached
to this vinyl-covered hardboard via 2 flush (flathead)
screws mounted to a flat bar which is riveted on the
inside (seat springs side) of the hardboard.

I snuck out to the garage and digipic-ed one for ya
(happend to be like the ONLY thing I have laying
around, oddly enough). Here's the link:

&gt; &lt;&lt; Can any tell me how the middle seat (full w/ 1/3
&gt; fold down) ash tray on
&gt;  the back of the seat was attached?  Was it just
&gt; rivited thru the seat
&gt;  material?  Did it have any type of backing?  I am
&gt; fairly certain that
&gt;  the ash tray is the same type as on the spare tire
&gt; cover.  Was the base
&gt;  the same? &gt;&gt;
&gt; if memory serves, there is a hardboard type panel
&gt; underneath the upolstry 
&gt; that the ashtray attaches to. dont know about the
&gt; base.
