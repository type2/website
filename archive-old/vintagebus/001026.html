Waving and not getting waved back? Not the bus but the
driver?
Dunno about that but it's a theory worth discussing
for weeks when the bandwidth is available. Paula
purebred was a little hesitant to begin driving the
zero mile Tararam '67 camper restoration because she
said that she felt more &quot;like a celebrity&quot; and got
more waves and smiles while driving the old
pseudo-Euro '57 single cab which needed everything.
Huh? I didn't know that it was a &quot;look at me&quot; thing-
In di alteh guteh tseiten I just drove the suckers
because I liked them.
I noticed that I stopped getting flipped off five
times per day when I switched from the Kam vos er
kricht '63 EZ camper to the 75 mph F150 with A/C.
Phoenix drivers tend to blend in at any speed as long
as you drive a Domestic pick up truck dumped to the
ground with at least one lawn mower in the back, a
reflective mylar cowqboy hat (that is supposed to
communicate what I don't know) and a Calvin and Hobbes character
urinating on the words &quot;La Migra&quot;. Whoever La Migra is he surely must
have &quot;p*ssed off&quot; a ton of landscaping people. Truly they must all need
a Kaneh. Commenting on the original observation of not getting waved at
by someone in a baywindow- I figured that the bay driver was probably a
Yenteh fat chick adjusting a bra strap, staddling a BigGulp and a $99.
hotdog while inserting the latest Yanni/Linda Evans-Babs Streisand
retrospective cassette tape. &lt;Oi, Vai!, I'm feeling Veklemped!&gt; Either
that or it was a guy trying to placate the demands of the K'vatsh,
Tshatshki fat chick in the passenger seat who was searching for the
casette tape. If it was a splittie it might have been due to their
inability to quickly do the requisite origami contortionist thing with
their arm in order to stuff it through the sliding drivers window.
