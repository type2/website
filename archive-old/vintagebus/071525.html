Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 Double Cab... 07-30-03

A true white trash truck would not get an inspection. Hell it probably wouldnt even have tags, or a
license plate for that matter. =) Im curious, is the rims being painted red - supposed to represent
white trash? I know a white trash guy who has a notch and wants to paint *everything*red; The
tranny, the pan, the beam, the engine, the rims.... Didnt know if that was a coincedence or not when
you said that.

On a serious note- Seeing how you are short on time to get your inspection. why not have them come
to you? I have done this multiple times, works good too cause you usually get the guy who knows what
hes doing which is why hes rollin solo to peoples houses.Also eliminates having to stand in line.
Have to stop by DMV and get on 'the list' at the main desk. Depending on how far they are behind,
this might be a better solution for you. Last time it took a few weeks and they said they considered
that &quot;super backed up&quot;. Might be quicker in your town. They call you when their on there way over.
