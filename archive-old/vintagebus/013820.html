Subject: [VB] Wiring problem-was Speaker resto &lt;F&gt;

OK, like, we all have suffered through the speaker
resto spew. Now I have a new one for you all &lt;y'all&gt;.
 
Being the vintage nazi that I am, I wish to restore
the wiring in all of my buses to the correct color
codes on the insulation. The problem is that I believe
in using the parts that came with the buses so I wanna
know how to put new insulation over the original
copper wiring. Is there a tool to help thread the
plastic casing over all of those PITA thin copper
strands? I know that it would be more sensible to just
use new wire with the insulation already over the
copper but I have my philosophies and integrity to
protect. Any suggestions?
Also, I live in Arizona and believe in doing it &quot;all&quot;
myself so if I were to restore the copper as well as
the insulation I would probably go to one of the many
Arizona copper mines and smelter my own copper. No
need to hire a professional or support vendors when I
can do it &quot;all&quot; myself. Just my opinion. I think that
I am either on crack or just happy to be through yet
another work week.

Uh, like why in the heck is there a [VB] in front of
all of the posts lately? Is this a continual tribute
to VanBondo? I suppose that if I ever get an email
list going I will have a [TF] in front of every post
as a payback. Sheesh, obligations and Catholic guilt
where ever I turn... &lt;grumble&gt; Thanks, Thom! =)
