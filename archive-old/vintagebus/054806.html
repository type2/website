Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Free Beam Come and get it!

Hello Richard

    I have had three people so far ask for it and I will give it to the
first person that responded to the email if they still want it. If they dont
want it I will email the next person and so on.



Sorry
Just a few days to go and my buses will have a new home.

&gt; Has anyone claimed this yet? If not, I would be interested.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt;     If anyone is interested I have a front disk brake front end. I got
&gt; it for some trade work but I am moving and don't want to store it in my
&gt; new house. I live on the Central Coast (California) and will be moving
&gt; this week. I will be able to retrieve it from the location that I am at
&gt; for about two weeks so please let me know. Sorry I wont ship it you pick
&gt; it up!
&gt;
&gt; PS: Everything is on the beam except the master cylinder. This came with
&gt; a 23 window that a previous owner was going to install.
