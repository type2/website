&gt;Haven't you guys ever seen that old brochure with all the north
&gt;american
&gt;dealers?
&gt;Shows location, phone numbers, address, name, date opened?

Yeah, we have a number of those. Well, one from June 16 1969 and one 
from 1965. The idea is we're going to build a database with all of 
the info. If a dealership is listed in both books, that will show. 
Then we're going to ask everyone to come visit and check off the 
dealerships that are still around.

I'll announce when it's up. But, if you have any questions for 
specific areas before then, ask away!

Scott
