I have read a couple of post that have made comments on single port heads as
they talk about other things.  I am curious.  The first comment was something
like SP heads are better for low end torque Vs DP head....or something like
that.  The second comment was that SP head are more durable.  Can someone give
me a quick SP Vs DP head head.  Any insight is appreciated.
