If the paint people are spraying are TWO PART paints (i.e.: catalyzed) then
you are breathing isocyinates.  That's CYANIDE people!  You can not smell it
or taste it.  The ONLY safe way to shoot this stuff is with a SUPPLIED AIR
breathing system.  Either shoot in a rented pro booth or buy your self a
&quot;Hobby Air&quot; prosumer type of supplied air respirator.  Canister filter masks
will not cut it!  You'll find out later in life when you're toting around one
of those little oxygen bottles on wheels!

Check out http://www.autobodystore_dot_com  they have some good prices on these
systems.  About as cheep as you will find for a hood type single person is
around $300-$350.

Happy breathing!
