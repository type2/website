&gt;Chris, I guess I should have clarified (and I shouldn't generalize). I
&gt;expect my VWs to start reliably down to about -15 Farenheit with a
&gt;traditional battery and 5-20 weight oil. I would hope the Optima would
&gt;start the Bus down to at least -20 or -25!
&gt;
&gt;How is the life of an Optima? When I priced them at a local FLAPS, they
&gt;were about $120 US. They have other advantages over traditional
&gt;batteries, but I would have to get about 15 years life out of it to make
&gt;it a comparable deal based on usable life.


Bus content. I don't have an Optima in either of my buses, I have huge deep
cycles. As to the starting power, I have a 427 Corv***e with an Optima.
Battery is behind the drivers seat inside the car. No fuming. The car has
three two-barrel Holleys which tend to drain out/evaporate the fuel over
time. I very rarely drive it, but start it once a month or so. The battery
has been cranking that engine up for a couple of years under these
conditions. Very cold-blooded car, it takes a minute or so of cranking to
fill the float bowls, then maybe another minute or so to get it to keep
running. Once started, I leave it run for maybe five minutes at a fast idle,
then shut it off. If the battery can start that car under these conditions,
you could drive your bus home in fourth gear on the starter alone. In
general, I have been replacing wet type batteries in my vehicles at right
about two years. Apparently they don't like the heat. This Optima is at
least four years old, but I don't think they've been around long enough to
say how long they'd last. Mine has a 6 year pro-rated warranty.
