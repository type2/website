&gt; I noticed the same thing last fall when I first got my '67 bus on the road.
&gt; Somebody out there correctly identified it as a resistance problem, caused

&gt; I think that was more than likely because the &quot;glow&quot; appeared brighter.
well,

thanks for the tip about corrosion, but i had pretty much rewired the
generator to the regulator with new wires as the PPO had a 14 gague wire
from the output of the generator to the regulator, a tad thin i'd say.

Thanks for the other tips as well, i figured it was wired up right as it
worked fine until sunday.  I tended to agree with clara that it was the
regulator. so...

I put in my first spare.  Then the light went off at high rpm and was
bright at idle. Hmm, wierd.

So, i put in my second spare.  Then all was well and everything worked as
advertised. (this second spare is pretty crusty on the inside though, i
dont think i'd trust it for longterm use..)

So, now that i am out of spares i am going to buy one of the new
solid-state units, then hopefully no more regulator problems, but at least
i'll still have one good spare then :)

Or maybe i'll get off my butt and put in my motorola alt i've been saving
for a rainy day.  Nobody wants them because they are externally regulated,
 and at swap meets the regulator is always missing. But, every superbeetle
in the junkyard seems to still have its motorola regulator under the rear
seat. A winning multi-stop alternator shopping combination.

thanks again for all the help,

Steve
