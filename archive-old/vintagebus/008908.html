Subject: Start of the RMMW/Banidmere Weekend Story

It's been a week since the RMMW/Bandimere event and I started writing a
story about it and then never got back to it.  Here is what I have so far -
I don' t know if I'll have time to finish.  Maybe Rob can pick up where I
left off...

RMMW/Banidmere 2000
===================

Thursday August 3rd, 2000

 I spent my evening after work cleaning up the fuse block on Li'l Red and
doing some last minute packing for the trip.  Rob and Justin showed up
sometime after 10:00.  They slept in the basement on makeshift beds.  Rob
and I stayed up while I played a little guitar.  I got to see Justin's
go-ped with the Beetle pedal car bumper installed on the rear and the OVWC
sticker in place of the &quot;D&quot; emblem.

Friday August 4th, 2000

 I got up and started hauling stuff out to Li'l Red.  Rob and Justin were
still sleeping but they had the added advantage that they were, for the most
part, packed.  I forgot what time we left but it was sometime after 7:00.
Jim Weitzel was very kind and gracious in allowing us to park both of our
beetles at his lake front home while we attended the show.  We shuttled back
and forth in order to get the rental car ('99 Saturn) and evetually around
10:00 we were on Interstate 80 headed towards Colorado.  We finally arrived
there at the Motel 6 that evening around 6:00 CST.  We checked in and I was
oh so ready for a rest.  I couldn't believe that just 2 years prior I had
done the trip in a Beetle with no A/C. :-)

Saturday August 5th, 2000

 Time for the RMMW show.  We overslept as I think everyone was dead tired.
The drive from our Motel 6 at I-70 and Federal Blvd. was pleasant.  We
stopped to get ice and pop - knowing that relying on vendors would drive us
broke.  As it was, RMMW's scratch and dent pile darn near took care of that
for us.  Rob found a bunch of cool stuff - things he needed for his
baywindow bus.  I netted such things as a replacement fried egg turn lense
and bulb holder for $5 with a minor defect (but at least it ain't cracked
and held together with blue RTV! :-)), various Super Beetle front suspension
parts (which no one cared to xref the part numbers - I painstakingly did.),
T4 2L P/C set and .020 mains, 2 front turn signal lenses, metal roof rack
for Li'l Red, T2 rearview mirror, and the list goes on and on.  The total
for my parts was $200 and I offered $175 and got it!  The P/C and bearing
set alone would have been well over $400 so I walked away a happy camper but
missed out on a large portion of the show because of it.  I met JP of the
New Mexico bus contingent and another guy named Bill who drives a white
makeshift DD westy with stickers all over the back of the bus.  He was very
helpful and informative in telling me stuff about putting a 68 front beam in
his bus (night and day dfference in the ride he said.) and other general VW
bus tech info.   I met a couple from the Salina, KS area in the wooded
parking lot and I also met their camping friend Jim.  They had baywindow
buses and were having fuel pump problems (which they were fixing.)  We got a
tour of their bus and the neat upholstory job they did.  I liked the velcro
panel that affixed over the pop-top hole to keep the heat/drafts out.  They
said that it worked great in sealing the elements out from their 71 Westy.
I got a couple photos of it as well.

 So as the day progressed, we had so much stuff loaded in the Saturn that
Rob ended up having Mike Carroll haul stuff back to Omaha for him.  I was
going to bungee/strap the roofrack down to the stop of the Saturn and carry
stuff home up there butwe didn't need to.  We followed a line of VWs to the
top of Pike's Peak including an old light grey split window bug which made
it absolutely with no problems.  Kerry and I took the loaded down Saturn
while Rob and Justin rode in Mike's Vanagon.  The air is so thin up there
that a few people had trouble getting their vehicles to start.  I got dizzy
and had to sit down but the view was amazing!  Meeting up with Ed Flaherty
of the Hastings, NE was a nice surprise.  He offered to take my roofrack
home with him and so the rack changed hands right there at the top of Pike's
Peak.:-)  I just have to meet up with him later to get it back.  He's only 2
hours from me so no big deal.  I truly appreciated this gesture on his part
because it really simplified the return trip.

 As we progressed down the peak, it soon became evident that the lack of a
1st gear selection on the Saturn was going to cause an interesting decent.
At the transition point between the steep dirt road and the more gentle
paved surface was a brake checkpoint where brake temps are checked.  I could
smell my brakes and told the guy when I rolled up.  He confirmed a temp of
around 500F and said we needed a half-hour minimum cool down period so we
pulled over and parked.  I got out the guitar after a little rest and soon
generated some interest from a couple (Pat was his name but I can't remember
hers.)  They are members of the RMVC and they had a big photo book of past
events.  It was really nice to see that book, meet them, and swap guitar
songs.  The half-hour turned into an hour so the brakes were thoroughly
cooled down and the cold intermittant rains and air temps were enough to
finally send us on our way down the mountain with hopes of seeing each other
at Bandimere the next day.  We were treated to an awesome rainbow display on
the descent and pictures were taken.  It was a great view and one which I'll
never forget.

 We finally found us a McDonalds to eat at on the way back up to Woodland
Park and with that out of the way, we headed 13 more miles up past Woodland
Park to the Rainbow Falls campsite where the bus gathering was in full
swing.
