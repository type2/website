&gt; &gt;Ok, I've run across a strange bus.  It has a split-window front-end,
&gt; &gt;a narrow-hatch back end, round taillights, and a sliding 
&gt; door!  It also has 
&gt; &gt;baywindow-style side windows - the long ones.  It also has 
&gt; push-button 
&gt; &gt;front door handles.  To top it off, it has deluxe skylights, but no
&gt; sunroof.
&gt; Brazillian Bus?  I saw one at the Classic...now I can't 
&gt; recall if it had
&gt; cargo doors or a slider...


The Brazilian splits had pull out front door handles like the earlier German
buses. They had side cargo doors like a barndoor(they are
interchangeable)and not sliders. We got a lot of them here in South Africa
and I have not seen one with skylights or a sunroof. The rear lights were
the same as the '63 on German split buses.

The easiest way to identify one is by the nose emblem. The Brazilian buses
have the emblem pressed into the nose skin itself.

Immediately after they stopped making the split buses(about '76) they
produced a really oddball hybrid. It had a baywindow nose and front doors
but was pure split all the way to the rear lights which where the
rectangular later bay type - this makes them look very strange when viewed
from the rear. These were splits mechanically with a bit of bay chucked in
for cosmetic reasons. They are uggggly.
