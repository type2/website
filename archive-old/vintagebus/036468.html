&gt;  Don't understand though the may 5-11 bit, thoughthe called its last day the
&gt;production date, and that it would be april 65.

BUT - my bus is chassis number is 148182 , and Moore's is 143678... wacky
as things get on a production line, I doubt that they made busses by
counting backwards on 'em. So his HAS to have been made BEFORE mine. Ten
days and 4504 busses before mine. So mine must have been made in May, not
April, despite what the plate says.
- - - - - 
your truck is 265 148 182

production month end figures say

APril 65 -----215 146 424
May 65 ------215 161 145

which says it was made in eary may 1965, so ya sounds like the plate guy 
messed up.

What I didn't get was how they could give it a range (may 5-11 or whatever)- 
never heard of that how wierd.   Why not just ONE DAY, okay its done now.  
whatever.

BTW, the VIN numbers for the beetle are not in the same series as the bus.   
iat the beginning of  63 they were at 5 225 042 for the bugs, and at  1 047 
067 for the buses.

through 55 the vins started with 1- for the bugs, and 20- for the buses.  
engine numbers too.    For some time the engine numbers were the same 
regardless of wether it was fr  a type I or II.

   Then  in 65 the vw got a 9 digit VIN, the first number being the type, 2nd 
model, 3rd yom, so I filled in his trucks vin with 265, being a transporter,- 
model =truck, 65 yesr.   Isn't 65 just after they started the type 3s-   they 
probably didn't want things confused.
