&gt; Supposedly my van has a beetle engine in it, according to the little rich
&gt; boys who sold it to me. Engine number is
&gt; 211 101 102
&gt; which i found on the right side bottom of the crankcase after I took the
&gt; heads off. Now call me crazy but a bus is a type 2, hence the 211?
&gt; Is it possible to determine year of vehicle an engine came in with this
&gt; info? Thanks for any help.

The number you found is the spare part number of the crankcase half.
You´ll find the engine number right below the generator stand below
&quot;Zündfolge 1-4-3-2&quot;
