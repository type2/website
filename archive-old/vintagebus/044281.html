&lt;&lt; Is it possible to change the stop light switch on the master cylinder 
without having to change the whole master cylinder(i just put a new master 
cylinder in 2 years ago-german made). I also would prefer to avoid having to 
bleed the brakes right now, as i don't currently have access to the very good 
working space. &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Yes you can!  Make sure your brake resivour is full.  Just have the new 
sender at the ready, loosen the old sender with a wrench and finish taking it 
out with one hand.  While doing this last part have the new sender in your 
other hand and as soon as the old is out install the new.
  First though do check the sender by using a dash bulb type of static timing 
tool to check for electricity at the sender.  One of thiose wires have to 
have voltage to it.  If not then you have to follow the wiring upstream to 
the real problem!  Eric&amp;Barb
