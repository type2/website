Subject: FS:  66 Dirtbag Hippy Westy-Nor Cal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The wife is going to sell her beloved 66 westy hardtop camper in leu of a 
newborn Expedition. Too many rats in the stable to keep insured.  The bus is 
nothing I would want to restore body wise, but it is a good runner.  Good for 
someone that needs good running early bus but not too particular about its 
looks.   Something a Hippie would like.  I know, several have offered to buy 
it from me over the last few years.  

The good:  low mileage dual port 1600 (less than 10k miles) , brakes, 
bearings, redux bearings, master cyl, etc mechanical all done over these last 
few years with little miles since.  Complete and relatively decent (by hippie 
standards..) Original Westy Camper interior including stove/ice box, bed, 
orig - not torn seats, orig slider curtains all around including all those 
little dinging bobbers that attach to the fabric, table, coat hooks, lights, 
etc.  The plastic trim everywhere is rough.  The side panels have water 
damage from leaky windows. The roof panels are good all around.   I am 
keeping the spice rack.  

The bad:  rust in the rockers.  Someone put riveted aluminum sheeting over it 
in places.   Dings/dents here and there. 

The ugly:  Hand brushed blue/white paint job.  Actually not bad if you are 
earthy.

This bus has been to many a reggae show these last few years.  Definately 
fits the bill with this respect.  I made it a good runner as we took the 
whole family (that includes lots of Rainbows.......) in it during the summer 
months.  Pretty much the only use it got.  I still drive it once in a while 
to work.  Needs one tire for a long trip to your home.  I can fix this tho 
before.

I do not wish to part her out.  It stays on the road.  Oh, her name is Rosie. 
 

$1200 obo by next month.   Email for pics of whatever you wish to see.
