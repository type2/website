&lt;&lt; Is there any problems with the auto glass silicone causing rust?&gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Never should silicon sealant be used in window seals.  After about 6months it 
is worthless and as you found out can actually hold in water to rust out the 
steel!

&lt;&lt;In my 57, the old man siliconed all the windows shut.  Saved the interior 
but my popout frames are toast.  I would be worried about this stuff they 
inject rusting out the channel under  the window frames. &gt;&gt;
The side window opening self drain.  While the windshield opening in the body 
are tilted backward so the bottom sill of this area fills and stays full of 
water if sealant is not used.  The silicon that your old man used probably 
acted more like a dike to hold water under the pop-outs.  Roofing tar is the 
only sealant we have been able to find that not only reseals when the weather 
gets warm, but repels rust!   Eric&amp;Barb
