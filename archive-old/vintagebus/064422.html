The suspension &quot;system&quot; of a vehicle is a &quot;tuned&quot;
collection of parts. When you go beyond factory tolerances,
you enter a region of unknowns. If you decrease the spring rate
by removing leaf springs, they no longer complement the rear
spring rate and the damping characteristics of the front and rear
shocks. It should be obvious that when you lower the bus,
you need to limit the suspension travel because there is simply
less travel available. This would seem to indicate that you should
stiffen the spring rate, not lessen it.
Compare your lowered bus to another stock bus, you will see the
changed angle of the tie rods. This is part of the steering geometry
which has been machined to produce the caster, camber, and toe
of the stock steering system. Changes in the steering geometry will
produce unusual handling characteristics ( bump steer, etc. ) for which
stock parts may not be capable of compensation.
It is possible to &quot;retune&quot; the system to produce a decent lowered ride,
but experience and machining is required to redesign the suspension
components to allow for the changes.

&gt; ya, removed leaf springs from the front end have several effects
&gt;
&gt; 1) lowering bus
&gt; 2) very jolty ride
&gt; 3) weakening suspension

&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; 4.  Have a front suspension that additionally has had spring leaves
&gt; removed
&gt;  to weaken the springs to lower it, or failure of these leaf springs
&gt;  (cracking) due to wear, DPO driving habits, or even removal of front
&gt;  suspension rubber snubbers and their mounts.  DANGER, DANGER,  (Flailing
&gt; arms
&gt;  about) this can easily result in the rest of the leaves failing suddenly
&gt;  while at speed.  Resulting in the front of the bus suddenly resting on
its
&gt;  front wheels and even the pavement.  Look Ma no steering!!!  Flip, flip,
&gt;  flop!
