Subject: Westy interior question
Date: Sun, 8 Apr 2001 22:41:26 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a '67 westy that was pretty complete and unmolested when I bought it
a few years ago. About an inch below both side interior lights are two small
holes (one on top of the other). Does anyone know what mounts in these
holes, or is it a hack of some sort?

From this pic there doesn't seem to be anything there. Just curious.
