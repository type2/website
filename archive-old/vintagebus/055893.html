Subject: Hope for the next generation

I thought everyone on the list would enjoy hearing that at my son's high
school, our 1966 Westfalia was recently voted &quot;coolest car&quot; in a student
body poll conducted by his school newspaper. Our 1966 beetle and my son's
friend's 1967 beetle rounded out the top three in the voting.
It's always fun to drive by the student parking lot and see the distinctive
beetle and split window bus shape among the sea of Neon's and rice-burners.
