Hey all...

Time is drawing *MUCH* closer to when I have to move...So now the price goes
to $1800CDN (roughly $1225US)..  Here's what it is:

'66 bus (standard)
rebuilt '71 motor (only 10k on it)
after-market skylight (might be a &quot;regulation&quot; Westy hole in the roof)
brand spankin' new winter tires
new generator/voltage regulator
new battery
rebuilt carb
nice all-wood interior + bed in the back
body in great shape

Gimme a call at (604) 836-8520 or send some email to my phone at
brayden_at_bigfoot_dot_com and we'll talk..

B.
