&gt; Click &amp; CLACK           By TOM &amp; RAY MAGLIOZZI      King Features
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;DEAR TOM AND RAY: I was thinking of buying a Volkswagen Microbus. I know that means constant repairs, etc. But I  currently drive
&gt; a 1987 Jetta with 166,000 miles that also needs constant repairs. So I figured if I'm going to be  repairing my car all the time, I might as
&gt; well have a cooler vehicle, l'm graduating from high school soon, and I plan on going to college next year. What do you think?  -- Nick&gt;&gt;
&gt; Before we dump too harshly on &quot;Click and Clack&quot;, let us consider this. . . this is a kid considering this purchase!

My own feeling is, a bus is not a great choice for a first time driver anyways. The kid is certainly better off in his Jetta and probably should have something even more substantial.

Besides. . . who gives a ratsass if &quot;Click and Clack&quot; wanna bad mouth our busses. Let em!!! Who the hell ever decided that these guys were big time auto experts anyways?? They write a feature: they are writers.

Consider the source.

Les
