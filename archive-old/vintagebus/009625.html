&gt;And then there is Naples to the South. Everyone STOPS for green lights and
&gt;GOES on the red ones. As weird as it sounds, IT WORKS. Since everyone local
&gt;stops and looks at every green light before they go, and every one ignores
red
&gt;lights altogether, everyone assumes responsibility for their own safety at
&gt;controlled intersections. That is everyone but the tourists who show blind
&gt;trust that they can go at green lights. This is the biggest cause of
accidents
&gt;in Naples.


This is the case in Puerto Rico, except it requires one to be familiar with
the cross streets at particular intersections. At a light coming out of a
business district, drivers will stop for the red during business hours, but
the won't even touch the brakes after normal closing hours. After a week
there, I was blowing off red lights without even realizing it. Makes for a
tough readjustment back home. They will also pass on the right, left, or
underneath you if necessary. There are lanes worn in the dirt on the
shoulders of the freeways called &quot;trooper lanes&quot; by the locals. These are
used every bit as much as the pavement during morning and evening commute.
Because of this, it is not safe to pull onto the shoulder in the case of
mechanical problems. I saw a garbage truck getting a transmission replaced
in the middle lane of the freeway! Ambulances drive with their flashing
lights on all the time, but only use the siren in case of emergency. They
are completely ignored at all times.
Speeding, however, is taken very seriously. Go figure.
