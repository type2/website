Hi! Just to let anyone who may be interested know:

There is a single cab for sale in Mt. Pleasant, IA. It is, I believe, pre
1963 judging by the turn signals in the front. They are the kind that
sticks out three inches or so. It appears to be in overall pretty good
shape, although the bed portion is a little rusty, and the sides and rear
drop down panels are holed through with rust on the bottom, as are the
doors to the under-bed storage area. It looks pretty much all original,
although I am by no means an expert.

It is located on Rte. 34, at a place call Schrader's Used Cars. The
address is 805 S. Washington, Mt. Pleasant, IA, and the phone number is
319-385-8699. They are asking 3900 or best offer.

Hope this helps someone!

Chris
