&lt;&lt; Hello, I've got a leaky rear axle and was going to replace the seal today. 
There is no play in the wheel, but definitely a balsy rumble when I spin it. 
So I figure I'll replace the bearing too. Since I've got plans this 
afternoon, I'm going to do it tomorrow, and today I'll buy a new bearing and 
let the tranny fluid drain (all 4 plugs).
 
 My question is: should I buy a bearing puller or just try prying the thing 
out? I'd like to get it done tomorrow and don't want to spend a lot of time 
getting it out. Are there different types of pullers? How would I know which 
puller to buy? Do I get it at the FLAPS or the VW parts store?
  &gt;&gt;
 read the reduction box section in your bentley reprint of the transporter 
workshop manual.   There are 4 bearings per side, not just one, 

but yes, the rumble means bad things.   I would pull off the RGBox outer half 
and check out what is inside.  The outer two bearings can be replaced fairly 
easily, though the lower outer is near $50 it seems.
