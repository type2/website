Subject: BA 6 heater

If anyone is near Sacramento, Calif. and wants a BA 6 heater.....  Go to the Pick n Pull foreign yard on
Recycle Rd in Rancho Cordova. There you will find a 2 tone 78 bus with a complete heater in it. Only thing
missing is the timer switch. Even has the belly pan under it. I saw it late this afternoon but did not have
enough time to get it.
