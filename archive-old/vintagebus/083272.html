Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg 
  dipstick oil  temp...

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; if you look at the owners manual for your VW, yes max speed=cruising
speed.
&gt; This is max speed they recommend the VW be driven at, NOT the max  speed
you
&gt; can push it to go.  Does not mean they designed it to be floored  w/o ill
&gt; effect.
&gt;   In fact, governors were added at some point to keep the rpms from  going
&gt; above what VW considered max.
&gt;
&gt; VWs do run hotter when driven faster than 'max speed'

Then you'll also have to explain to me how I can literally FLOOR my Type 2's
for hundreds of miles non-stop fully loaded with head temps never getting
higher than 375-ish, and oil temps no hotter than 200-210. Explain that.
Back up your claim. Ask any of the local bus guys up here in SLC and they'll
tell you that my buses do NOT have any heading/dependablitly issues.

Sorry, but you are wrong on your information. When you bought a VW new from
the dealer back in the day, you were able to push the thing as hard as you
wanted as long as you weren't over-revving it. The governor stopped the
motors from over-revving. Not to reduce throttle at lower rpms when pulling
a hill!

Just because you can't build a bus motor that is able to acomplish this
task, doesn't mean it's impossible.

Hey, i'll tell you what, if anyone is interested, I can build them a copy of
my last motor full turnkey, ready to install. All cooling tin, intake,
exhaust, everything. Complete, ready to install. You'll be able to floor it
70mph all day long without running hot on heads or oil temps, it won't leak
a drop of oil, and to maintain proper oil pressure, you just need a light
5w30 oil in the sump. e-mail me if you want one built. I'll figure out the
cost if I have any takers.

Yes, your heard right, I run 5w30 oil in my buses. Now before anyone starts
cat-calling that i'm doing my motors no good by running this oil, keep this
in mind:
Who's flooring thier motors on the highway year after year, for hundreds of
miles at a time, fully loaded, etc, etc, and who can't becuase of
heat/dependability problems?  ;-)

If this rubs a few of you the wrong way, i'm sorry. There is a lot of bad
information out there regarding VW engines and thier cooling
systems/requirements and sometimes I just get fed up when people try to tell
me i'm the one doing it the wrong way, when I get better
performance/reliability than any of them.

See you on the flip side. I'll be the one flooring my bus up the canyon or
against a headwind without a problem.
