 I know that Wolfsburg West does repros these
 Like their front floor mats, the tops are of very high quality, but they 
lack 
 the honeycomb webbing on the bottom side. I assume the cargo mats are like 
 this. I think that any floor mat until 1974? works as the mat is the same 
 repro _at_ WW.
 Please correct me if I'm wrong.
 
 As for interior panels, I'm thinking of putting them in my panel, but id 
have 
 to make them? I talked to a guy _at_ WW who said they have the grey fibreboard 
 material (that's what my front panel are) in bulk sheets which measure 48&quot; 
by 
 52&quot; .  Would this be large enough? I wanted to put up a hardboard headliner 
 in 2 sections in the cargo area but I don't think this will fit. Does anyone 
 have suggestions?
 
 thanx-pete

yes, a bay mat will fit in a split.  As for originality they are different in 
terms of holes cut in.  Also, I have seen a panel van mat- not holes for seat 
attachments.

If you are making hardboard panels in the panel, forget WW, go to your local 
home depot type store and get 4x8 sheets of hardboard.   Unless you want to 
pay extra to get the pattern .   I have seeen a couple panels that had the 
option of panels in the cargo area, and they were flat I think, not textured. 
  Anyone remmebr that bus at Jerome last year with the cargo doors the wrong 
side and original panels in back?
