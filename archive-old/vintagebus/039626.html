yep... they are closer to $8000USD. i went to Mexico on my honeymoon and 
stopped at a dealership to ask how much. the guy was telling me to &quot;drive 
one back to Ohio,&quot; i guess he didnt understand about laws and stuff :-) i 
wanted to test drive one real bad, but we were going to swim with dolphins.
later,
