Yes, they DO leak from the sender itself, and often right outta the box - I
once went through 5 of the things, all apparently from the same batch.
German ones don't seem to do it often, Brazilian ones don't, Mexican ones
seem to be the culprit; they  don't seem to crimp the metal around the
plastic part tightly enough.
Gently wiggle the plastic part... wiggly = potentially leaky.
