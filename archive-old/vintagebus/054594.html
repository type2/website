Hehe...quality material, Ellis.   Good one!

Struck a nerve as my fifth child was born on 7, Oktober and one of my
westies was trailored to it's new home in Ohio 2 days ago.  Threw in a
complete engine as a bonus just to get it out of my shed.  Getting ready to
ebay some parts.  My 8 year old remembers when we used to camp all the time
and go to vw shows/campouts.
Thanks for the biography...I didn't know anyone was watching;)
Daddy
