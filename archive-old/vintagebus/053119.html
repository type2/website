Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals

I've found that if you paint the tar on the edge of the glass it'll be =
just enough to seal the laminates AND get tarry goop all over the =
windshield. I use a smallish blade screwdriver to open the seal enough to =
push onto the glass.  Get enough tar on the frame to lubricate the =
flipping lip of the seal. When you push the window in, the seal will touch =
the out facing tar.  A tiny squirt of WD40 on the tight spots will keep =
the rubber from tearing.=20
One person can do the rear window if you're 6'2&quot; and have a prop under the =
opened hatch.=20
One more tip... don't use brake parts cleaner spray to clean up unless you =
want to remove the ink off your rear window stickers. No more ECV on my =
camper!

Eric likes to tar the seal before putting the seal on the glass, but I =

I believe this is the point where I made my life difficult.  I believe =

clarification on this point discussed in the thread last week may in fact =

was using a condiment bottle to squirt in the tar.  This made a huge mess

the way to go; I suspect that the bead of tar should go under the point
there the lip meets the glass AFTER the windshield is back in the bus. &gt;&gt;
