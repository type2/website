Your  a LITTLE LATE!!!
                          That deal went down 2 weeks ago,and there was
not one bus to be bought!!!All ovals and a handful of Split Windows,No
war time vehicles......I don't know what info your getting but it's not
correct...It was not 100 vehicles either more like 30-50........There
was 40 W decklids among other things..............All the stuff is LONG
GONE...It will probably go down in history as the biggest NoCal VW Deal
of all time!!!

Mark

P.S.I did sell Stewart one of the ovals in the yard a few years
ago.....I understand,now about the US Meat Inspecters,it did not
surprise me......
