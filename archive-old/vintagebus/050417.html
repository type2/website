Hi Thom,
The Westie SO-34 &amp; SO-35 Flip-seats are made with walk thru bodies.  Since 
this was VW official camper conversion this seemed to be nessasary to keep 
the structure as stiff as possible.  Even though for these buses the back 
sections of the walk thru which would have been behind the walk thru seats 
was cut down for the Flip-seat to fit properly.  Eric&amp;Barb
