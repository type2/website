Subject: Re: [VB] VW trademark ? 

VW will re-introduce a van product in North America later this year  
and they will vigorously defend what they believe to be their  
intellectual property. If they didn't, then some 3rd world marketer  
would take advantage of it.

I have a domain with vw in it but don't do anything with it except to  
redirect to my project site. But the first letter I receive from  
them, I'll hand it over ASAP.
