Optima batteries rule. And whoever got the impression that
Californians don't get cold? It's 20 degrees outside right now....
Chris
Has anybody used these? It looks like a nice battery, but last I
checked, they were kind of pricey. They are supposed to charge up more
quickly; bonus for those of us running original generators. They are
also supposed to provide good starting power at low temperatures, which
the California crowd won't care about but some of us do.
