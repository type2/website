Ok People,

If a 16 year old can do it, you can too!  When the rebuilt engine went
in, I wanted 0 miles on the gague to monitor its wear. I don't remember
exactly what steps I took, but it was fairly easy.  I  was able to
slowly twirl an alan wrench into the cable hole to take of the miles,
but I figgured that would take too long. I took apart the gauge to
where I could see the gears.  I was able to spin a master gear forward,
but not backwords.  In other words, I could put the miles on, but not
take them off. Not A problem.  The speedo read about 8XXXX  miles on
it, so I figgured it would be easier to go forward anyways. For every
click you turn the gear, one mile goes on. This probably wasn't the
best way of doing things, but it worked: I took the speedo and turned
the gear real fast by running it down my arm. The gear would was turned
when it went down my arm. It hurt a little at the end, but I lived. Oh
yah, the gauge was done in about 15 mins.  Everything went back
together just fine, and now I can keep a clean record of my engine!
