Subject: Re: [VB] Warm Bus equals Happy Driver!!!!

My 71 bus had a southwind 2 (I think was the name) heater between the front 
seats, it was self contained in a black metal box the power and fuel went in 
the back and the exhaust exited out the bottom. All the controls were on the 
front of the box and it had an automatic temp switch that cooled the burner 
before shutting down. With that heater there was no lack of heat in that bus!
