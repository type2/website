Hi Pete,
Powder coating while extremely resistant to chipping and scratching or if it 
is applied to thinly will still rust if water, salt are allow to penetrate 
through to the steel.  Any paint without a zinc coating or primer underneath 
will rust and rather quickly spread.  The shop that does our powder coating 
does demo pieces out of five or six inch long one inch diameter steel zinc 
plated household electrical conduit.  Then at car swap meets pounds them flat 
to show how the powder coating does not chip or crack.  When we have them 
coat rims for us we have them zinc primer coat them first.  On areas of our 
VWs we use high zinc content primer first before painting.  This zinc coating 
slows way down the rusting of the steel underneath even when scratched 
through both it ant the paint.  Any paint without zinc coating of some type  
will allow rust viens to form under the paint and/or chips in the paint to 
expand quickly due to the rust prying up the paint off the steel like a 
crowbar.  We have applied high zinc content primer on spots of bare steel 
without painting and it takes about two years for the rust to start showing 
in spots through the primer here in the rainy PNW of USA.
When we rebuild our westie pop out frames and if we do up the original 
safaris we have, we will have them acid dipped and zinc plated to insure 
removal of rust and coating of the zinc in all the otherwise impossible nook 
and crannies they have!  Then powder coated with the zinc primer and color 
coated.  Eric&amp;Barb
