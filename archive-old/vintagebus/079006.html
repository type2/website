Subject: Cargo Flooring

So...  I'm putting my bus back on the road after a year of being parked...
Been doing lots of cleaning up of moldy gross interior, some brake work,
this n that...  I can't seem to decide what to use for flooring this time.
When I got the bus, it had carpet in the rear cargo area (this is a 66
Westy, btw...)  I took that out, as carpet gets too dirty, and laid down
some thin wood panelling with linoleum tiles stuck to it.  It looked ok, but
when I pulled it up it was all wet and fell apart.  Now, granted, now that
we're fixing the hole in the pop-top it won't get quite so wet inside, but
otoh this is vancouver and it's always going to get water in it.  I just
can't decide which is worse: something absorbent that will hold some
moisture, or something non-absorbent that will just trap it next to the
sheet metal?  I'm wondering what other people have used, and if they liked
it?  I use the bus for camping and such, so it needs to be easy to sweep it
out.
