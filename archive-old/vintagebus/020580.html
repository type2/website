Subject: Cable SpeedVision on VW's last week?
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Did anyone catch Speed Vision some time last week? 
Aparantly, there was a program on that was
spotlighting the VW.  On the segment about bus's, i am
told they oped up with a shot of my deluxe at the
Classic.  I am told that my wife and I are in kicking
back in the bus in the shot too.

did anyone tape this by any chance?  I would like to
get ahold of a copy.  I do not have cable so i can not
catch it on a re-run.

Anyone out there get this?

Thanks
Matthew
