Subject: Trailer hitch for my bus.
Date: Thu, 4 May 2000 13:27:14 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Last night after the brakes were done, I looked over the T3 trailer hitch
that I was going to bolt on to the bus.  Several nay-sayers jumped right in
and said that I really shouldn't hang the hitch off of the bumper bolts on
the frame.  After close inspection, you guys were right - this in effect
puts the WHOLE load of the hitch and bumper on 2 of the 4 bolts - not a good
thing.  I'm going to torch off a couple of arms or reshape them at least on
the hitch and do the torsion housing mount thing that actual westy hitches
use.  I want to know then after looking around under the bus, if the part
that clamps to the torsion housing runs between the shock absorber and the
tranny cradle or if it runs underneath the swingaxle arm and above the trans
cradle.  It appears to me that the first of the 2 choices makes more sense
because of more clearance but I wanted to clarify.  Thanks a ton for the
help.  BTW:  Some measurements or blueprints from an actual hitch would be
nice to have. (HINT HINT)
