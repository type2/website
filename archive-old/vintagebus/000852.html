I have a 66 camper that was unfortunately equipped with those large
rectangular sideview mirrors(hidious).  I have purchased some elephant ears,
however, I cannot get the bolt out that holds the door hinge in place.  Is
is threaded?  Both the left and right upper hinges are rusty and getting a
grip on these hinges is next to impossible because the head is rounded.  Any
ideas would certainly be appreciated.

Thanks,

T. Hackett
