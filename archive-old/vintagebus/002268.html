I went to hook up jumper cables on my newly acquired 67 westy (just towed it
home today).  I hooked the positive cable to the terminal that goes to the
starter and the negative cable to body.  The source vehicle had the positive
cable on the positive terminal and the negative cable on the negative
terminal.  When I did, it produced a HUGE spark.  We opted to push it into
the garage rather than continue.  My helper suggested it could be positive
ground.  Is this right?
Thanks,
Mike in NC
