Said John Briney:

&gt; i have a tent , has a rubber floor, it is orange like poptop material,
&gt; with a red and blue striped door, it has external poles, its in great

This is the &quot;Add-A-Room&quot; or &quot;Drive-Away&quot; model.

&gt; bought it,      anyway , does anyone know what year that would be
&gt; from? what its worth? does someone have a web page on these tents?

http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/ is a good place to start. ;-)  

Then Jon McCabe said:

&gt; Westy ambulance with a huge white tent?
&gt; 
&gt; Could this be a field hospital type tent? Sort of a Triage area for a
&gt; Mass Casualty situation? Too cool if it was...

Sounds plausible.  I need to get a pic of this for the site.

Then Christen Christian asked:

&gt; I've got some old original VW camper ads circa
&gt; 1964, that shows a splitty camper with a tent on the roof.  The tent
&gt; is only accessible from climbing a ladder on the rear of the bus, and
&gt; the tent is mounted on a roof rack.  I've never seen one for sale, and
&gt; never seen one at a show, or anywhere for that matter.  Have any of
&gt; you ever heard of or seen this tent?  The ad says to get the
&gt; &quot;upstairs&quot; option, you have to get the &quot;Super De Lux&quot; kit.  I reckon
&gt; not many of these were sold.

Sounds like the VWoA rooftop tent -- see pics in the non-westy pre-
68 section of the VW Camping Tents site (URL above).

Then Greg chimed in:

&gt; I have something called a &quot;TOUR-DE-BED the cartop sleeper&quot;.
&gt; Its about 4 feet wide by 7 feet long.

I'd LOVE to see pics of this to put on the site.  Sounds comparable 
to the Dove series (again, pics on the site).
