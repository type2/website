How many people have decided to go to the campout on Jordan Lake this
weekend? Without the Blue ridge, there has to be quite a few right? I just
want to make sure it won't be a late model bus gathering before I head over
there. Will there be anybody selling any parts? I'm just looking for a good
bus time, I wasn't too impresed with the bus turnout in Manassas, so I'm
hoping there will be a few more this weekend. I'd appreciate any p-mails or
list mails, just so I can get an idea if there will be a few people there
or not. I heard a little about it then nodody has said a word for a while.
Jason
