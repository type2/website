&gt; Ok.  I've stopped for some coffee and a question.  The book says that
&gt; .003 is the low spec for end play with the shims installed.  I've got
&gt; .0025.  The crank is all torqued down and spins like smooth silky
&gt; butter.  Is this still too tight a clearance??

Brand new engine,  I'd probably go with it, if i couldnt get any closer
with what i had on hand.  It will very likely loosen up during breakin.

A used engine?  alreay broken in?  I wouldnt want to run it that tight.

&gt; Also, can I use &quot;used&quot; shims?  Or must I get brand new ones??

Yes, you can use used ones.  Though you may be missing a few ten thou off
of them, as long as they are not bent or warped, and get you in spec,
use'm.

...david (usual disclaimers apply here...this is what I would do if it
were my engine.)
