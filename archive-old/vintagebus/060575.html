&gt; Problem was this- drove bus for about an hour- pulled over to buy gas and 
&gt; shut motor off. Upon starting motor up again noticed that starter appeared 
&gt; turn over slower than usual (attributed this to my somewhat undercharged 
&gt; battery the result of the bus sitting in the garage for too long).
&gt; 
&gt; Pulled over again approximately 15-20 minutes later to get a bite to eat. 
&gt; When I came out to turn the key over to start the bus up again- NOTHING!. 
&gt; No slow turn over, no click, absolutely nothing. However tried wipers, 
&gt; lights horn etc etc. they all still work fine however nothing with engine 
&gt; turn over. 

Hi Michael,
That sounds like a bad connection between the battery and starter or perhaps 
between the starter and generator/alternator.  If you have one or more of 
those lead batter clamps that clamp onto the battery cable to replace the 
original VW swedged on brass battery clamp one will have tons of truobles 
unless one removes these clamps from the cable and clean the cable and clamp 
where they connect.  We solder on new brass clamps From Shucks/Exide onto the 
OG VW cables to prevent corrsion from happening in these extra connections.  
Also check your fuse box for any fuses that get too hot to touch when running 
your bus.  Any fuse that gets hot needs at least cleaning or very probably 
the brass clips pressed into the fuse box need to be soldered together.
