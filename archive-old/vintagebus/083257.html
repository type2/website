Subject: Re: [VB] dumb question: is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to lower 
  compression?

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;  IF not then one can install shims between the cylinders and heads,  but
&gt; these can cause problems.

What problems? There are a LOT of high compression guys running copper head 
gaskets to improve sealing between the head and cylinder.
