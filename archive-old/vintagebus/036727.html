Hey Dave, don't forget the funky fuel pump too.  Found one of these in a junk yard once and thought it was a pretty cool find, although I haven't had a bus to use it on. A friend of mine once threw one away not knowing what it was and then spent the next 2 years searching for one for his 59 single cab resto.  I actually have a rear main for a bastard motor, just in case I ever end up with a bus that needs one.

They really have only collector value now, as they are not rebuildable, 
since the bearings &amp; seals have not been available since the '60s.
