I thought it was just me!!!!!!!  But someone else noticed that they repeat 
the same old **** every so often.  Sort of a cycle.  I haven't bought a mag 
in some time now.  If I want to read something, I'll just  go pick an older 
issue from my collection dating back to the early '80's.  It's better reading 
than the most recent ones I bought a few months back.

As for Jerome Jamboree coverage:  back when Pat Kelly was Pres. of the ABC, 
he was specifically told by one (or both) of the magazines that they require 
hotels and transportation furnished by the event promoter!  Whether this 
still holds true or not I couldn't say.  As has been mentioned, these 
magazines are something like a few Phoenix radio stations:  revolving doors 
for anyone and everyone to pass through.

Just my &quot;FWIW&quot;,
