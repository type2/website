&gt;&gt;It seems to be missing at all  rpms leading up to about 3000 rpm where it
&gt;&gt;seems fine.  bosch .009, webber progressive.

I run right at 8.9:1 compression now, and have no problem with detonation
but that is due to magic, no doubt, and the fact it is not lowered (&lt;ouch).
Run premium unleaded, suck lots of gas. Very cool running engine, around 180
oil temp, 275 cylinder head temp at 4000 on the highway. Not a quickie
rebuild though. Has a Type IV oil cooler in the doghouse, widened fan
shroud, extended cylinder shrouds, etc. blah, blah. Lots of time in building
that one. Anyway back to the reason for your call to the Psychic Friends
Network. Have you checked for manifold icing? Is the intake mysteriously
cool when running? Are you absolutely sure you have the valves adjusted
correctly? Do you have stock pushrods or the chromoly ones? If you have
chromoly, you don't adjust to .006&quot; like you might think. They fail to
expand like their aluminum alloy cousins so should be set at a loose 0.0&quot;
Which means they should spin freely but have no lash. Basically you set them
without a feeler guage, you just feel them. All of these things can stack up
against you. Since it runs decent at high revs and not at low, it sounds
like it might be poor fuel atomization and too large of a venturi. Of course
it could also be gremlins, ignition, lousy fuel, or as you say a vacuum
leak. Have you run it at high revs while checking it to see if it actually
running better or just seems smoother because of the speed? I am more
doubtful of a vacuum leak leading to both cylinders on one side running
poorly unless it is a big one on the boot connecting the center section to
the end castings. We're absolutely sure the plug wires aren't swapped on
that side? This is a dual port, yes? What might the venturi size be, on the
primary side of the carb? We'll figger it out, and if not, you can always
slam it to the ground, primer it, put 47&quot; woofers in the back seat, rip the
engine lid off, and sell it for thousands....
