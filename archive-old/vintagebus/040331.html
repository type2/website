Subject:  RE: [VB]  SKF N207E RGB bearing price - Ronnie biffs me
Date: Wed, 8 Nov 2000 11:35:13 +1100 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings all,

An update.  Ronnie tells me that he sells the N207E bearing in either SKF,
INA, or Fag 
for 48.95 U S dollars each, he also has ones from Canada
that he sells for 24.95 each.

So Ronnie has them cheaper than the $US90 mentioned in 
the archives (which is why I thought I could get them
for such a crash hot price!)

Apologises

---------------------------
I checked the archives and found quoted retail prices of around $US90 
in the US for the SKF or FAG N207E roller bearing.  Apparently ths this for
a
single bearing????????   Would someone like to check on this??????

I have sourced a limited number of SKF C3 N207E's here and the
fact they are 'old stock' (old buying price) coupled with the weak Aussie
dollar
means I could airmail a pair
of bearings into the US for around US$100 all up. 

Would anyone be interested?
