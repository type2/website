Subject: Re: [VB] Queen of all strange bus sounds

Sure do.  I have the 2nd edition of the book as a matter of fact.  That is
EXACTLY how I look at my bus.
I don't regret any of the money that I dump into the bus.  I just regret not
finding the right person to do it.
Let's face it .. I will probably NEVER be able to do any more than adjust the
idle or an oil change.  But what
I can do is learn enough about the way it works, what's what .. so NOBODY can
ever rip me off again.  That's
what I am hoping to accomplish here.  FOR EXAMPLE .. when I wrote the check
that included them changing
the 6 volt system to a 12 volt system .. it sure would have been nice to know
in advance that THE 67 CAME
with a 12 volt system.  Sure felt like a sucker a week later when I was
cleaning the bus and notice the sticker
labeled 12 volt !!!  and that's not the half of it all .. but it those sort of
things won't happen again, you can be
sure of that ..

  Do you have a copy of the Idiot Book? &quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagen
  Alive&quot; by John Muir... it's not perfect, but it will change your
  relationship with your VW. Look at having an old VW as not making
  monthly payments, but monthly improvements... hang in there.
