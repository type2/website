Even better - how about adding a reciprocating arm and standoff, and make them
work parallel to the side of the window, like a big truck!  If you think
about it, you'd be wiping a larger area that way!

&gt; I've had this idea for quite sometime and wondered if anyone has actually
&gt; tried it.  Is it possible on an old bus (or maybe even a bug for that
&gt; matter) to flip one of the control arms on the wiper frame so that when you
&gt; turn on the wipers, instead of them going back in forth in tandem, have them
&gt; come close together and then apart again?  I think it would add a neat psudo
&gt; vintage flair since our dubs are kind of odd anyway (compared to modern
&gt; vehicles).  Has anyone tried this?  Is there even room under a split window
&gt; dash to allow for the linkage to take a slightly different path?
