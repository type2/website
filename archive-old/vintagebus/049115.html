 The local VWFLAPS had a free swap meet this weekend in bustling Fresno. There were less than a dozen vendors, all private heaps of junk except for the host. In general, good stuff cheap. A gas flap lock cost me $2. Karl found a drive-away tent for a pittance, two P style church keys for half a pittance and other misc. stuff. Don't pass by the local, small swaps.  I would have spread some of my extra stuff around, but had to work that morning. 

The host had a stack of about a dozen rear pully shrouds for sale. Being a repair shop, I assumed they came off VW's they repaired. VW didn't put anything extra into their engines, so what is the function? These cover the lower half of the crank pully and humps over the nut.  Safety? Cooling?  It's rare to find flaps in a junkyard engine around here. 
 While we're visualizing that area, what would the function be of a factory looking hook mounted to the top-rear of the rear lower pully shroud? Too high to be a crank starter guide, about a 1.5&quot; opening. I found one on a '66 standard.
