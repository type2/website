&gt; We scored 2 1960 double door panels, which were currently owned by the
&gt; *original* owner's grandson; gramps bought them both at the same time on
&gt; the same day at the same dealer in SF.  Both dove blue.
&gt;
&gt; I also got a 1960 walk-thru panel which I &quot;had&quot; to take as part of the deal.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We spent *all* day bringing these things home, from 7:00am to 7:00pm.  A
&gt; very, very long day,
