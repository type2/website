 &gt; Hey everybody:
 &gt;
 &gt; Can anyone recommend a good source for metric hardware (nuts bolts, studs
 &gt; etc).
 &gt;
 &gt; Whenever I replace a nut or bolt on my VW, I try to use stainless when it is
 &gt; available. My hick town seems to have a fear of &quot;those damned foriegn sizes&quot;
 &gt; and therfore the supply is minimal.
 &gt;

Stainless harware is not always better. SS tends to be a lot softer, less strong, 
than original or 'standard'  hardware, of course you can get SS in several strenght 
classes, but still it's a thing to keep in mind. If you have a VW or Porsche Dealer 
in your area just order original, if you just buy a couple of nuts and bolt at a time 
it'll be just as expensive, and in a lot of cases even cheaper, I sell original M6
Porsche washers for less than $0.03. Keep everything greasy, even if it's only the 
part of the bolt or nut that you don't see. 

Hope it helps,

Brian
