Subject: [VB] 1966 Shifting and gearbox Questions
Message-ID: &lt;19991217050926.71566.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hi all, I'm 21, and just got my first Bus a 1966 13 window deluxe in July. I 
could really use advice on fixing a problem with fourth gear. I can drive in 
fourth but I have to keep pressure back on the shifter or it will jump out 
of gear. Any ideas on fixing that? I also will be rebuilding the redux boxes 
soon and wondered if anyone had any advice on what to look out for, common 
mistakes, and any warning signs I should look for while they are open. 
Thanks
