aww,, bugger!! of course they did, i just wrongly
assumed - at first glace that it was rhd.
thanks for the correction to my foolish error thom. i'm losing my mind, what
was i thinking!!
i've got the bus book you mention (signed by seume -oooo i hear you say -
for an excellent 'ebay' experience in 20 years time! ;)  and looked at those
pictures -  stopping at thought of finding a magnifier to look closer :)

not really a good idea to take notice of which way a picture looks anyway -
i've noticed a fair few pictures in books, on the web, and especially in the
vw press that have been transposed.

&gt; one picture a possibly incorrect assumption about an incomplete body shell
&gt; being RHD is made, simply because the doors were on the wrong side.
