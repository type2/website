Subject: Re: [VB] Baywindow exhaust question

Another thought. The heater on Type 4's is part of the engine, more so than Type 2's. Removing any of it can jeopardize the cooling of your engine unless you make changes. I'd keep it intact as a backup to your gas heater. Wouldn't using the waste heat of the stock system be better for gas useage?
