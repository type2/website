Subject: Neato Webpage?

Hey y'all...

I've been off list for a few weeks. Didnt have time for all the ebay
content....but lets not go there....

I just surfed to the neato webpage, and it is gone! Has there already
been a thread on this? 
I emailed Bill Bowman ( or at least the address that DaveE has up on the
default nEATO page) and it bounced. 

Other NEATO people out there? Is there any movement to get NEATO to
allocate some cash for registering the domain name? I have oodles of
free web space that they could park it at for free. I suspect others
(type2.co, vintagebus_dot_com, etc) could also. 

I hope Im not the first person to hollar about this....
