Subject: Re: [VB] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

Funny thing is the old Vw and old BMW motorcycle crowds over lap somewhat.  
They both have air cooled horizontally opposed motors.  Anyway, Met this guy 
who had a bike shop who was into BMWs and he was amazed how much aftermarket 
stuff you could get for old buses.   Because BMW would crack down on any one 
else doing that (sound familiar?) Wished he could for the BMWs as it'd be 
cheaper.   then again, I was amazed how much stuff you could get for old BMWs 
at the dealer, and wished I could for the bus as the pieces would be better 
quality.

&lt;&lt;  Last night on speed vision there was a story on BMW motorcycles, not that
 this has anything to do with VW's, but wait, yes it does. Do you know that
 BMW cars and motor cycles FULLY SUPPORT their vintage market and are
 bringing out old dies and molds to remake parts for their VINTAGE
 cars/motorcycles! The goal of BMW is to be able to furnish any part
 necessary to help you restore your BMW, from sheet metal to the most minute
 screw. WAY to go BMW almost make me want to convert!!!
