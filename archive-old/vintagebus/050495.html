Subject: Feeling a bit looser this afternoon

Hi all! I went to my local VW junkyard (what does FLAPS stand for anyways?)
and got a wiper motor mount plus the 6V motor. My '59 Micro was converted to
12V before I bought it, and it came with a 12V wiper assembly - trying to go
back to the Dark Side. I wanted to go back there myself and pick some parts
up, but the used parts guy told me that I would have to go find the parts I
wanted, then come back and tell him so that he could get one of the
employees to get the parts... sounded kinda weird and feeling kinda dumb for
bringing my now useless toolbag :( When I get to the counter, the guy tells
me it's gonna be $75! Well, I figured in a little labor for the 1.5 minutes
it took the helper guy to get the wiper motor out, but I still couldn't
figure out how he came up with $75 for a dirty, greasy,
prolly-needing-a-rebuild wiper motor who's cover is all dented. I ended up
paying for it :) because the guy who went out to get the part with me was
pretty cool and drove a very nice '72 Bus - we had some good bus talk. I
would've felt kinda bad making him walk all the way out there for nuthin'.
Anyhoo, just felt like venting a bit...

Jesus V.
