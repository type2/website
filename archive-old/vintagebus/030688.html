Nice for who Jim?  Obviously the gentleman selling it.  Get this, he told me
he bought it at an estate sale.  I got the impression it was under 50
bucks.  He almost didn't find the corner brackets.  Went back two days later
and found them in a drawer.

I am thoroughly depressed.  There I no way in hell I'll ever convince myself
to pay that kind of money for an accessory.  I'd be hard pressed to spend
600 for a used one.  I think the high bidders ID says it all!

Anyone on the list bid that dumb thing up.  When are people going to stop
incrementally bidding on things  multiple times???   You're just driving the
price up for yourself.
