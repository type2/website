Subject: more battery stuff 

I must of got really lucky as we only drove the bus about once or twice a
week and it was only 5 or 6 miles to the Safeway outside of town. One
interesting tidbit that I have heard and actually tried seemed to work. If
your battery is not cranking well because of cold try turning the lights on
for a few minutes. The theory is that the current draw warms the battery
and makes it work better. I vaguely remember trying this and it seemed to
work, although I would'nt make a habbit of it. Any physics buffs know if
this should actually work?
Just more worthless rambling,
