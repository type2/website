Subject: Re: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I don't play one on television and I
didn't sleep at a Holiday Inn last night. But...
If I were a company trying to collect names of groups and organizations
that I want to send legal notices to how would I do it? One way would be
to post a &quot;Draft&quot; document that seems to offer a way to allow those
groups to do something they badly want to do. You could then have them
submit their names and how we can get a hold of them when the &quot;Final&quot;
agreement is complete. The Final agreement can have anything you want in
it. You are making up the rules anyway. You say you don't want to pay a
&quot;Membership Fee&quot;, tough.  Don't like it or don't wish to follow it? To
bad. Here is an order to release the domain name and close your site. If
we deceide we don't like your website because you say bad thing about
us, you are outta here. 
I say you should never stick your head up while the gunfire is still
blazing.
But that's just my opinion
