&gt;
&gt;Some people have also used that bubble-foil stuff, which is really 
&gt;reasonable.  

That stuff (Reflectix, I think, is the brand name) seems to work
pretty well.  A friend of mine built a small camping trailer on
one of those 4x8 utility trailers.  He covered everything except
the floor with Reflectix (stapled to the wood) and then covered
that with about 1/4&quot; coarse felt (carpet tacks).  The floor is
just indoor/outdoor carpet over the wood with a 4&quot; foam pad for
the bed.  On the outside, it has a few coats of that white goopy
mobile-home roof sealant.

The primary idea was to stay warm.  We need blankets, but we've
slept in it in 35-40 degree temperatures with no problem.  It
does get warm in the summer time, but (I think) not as warm as
an otherwise uninsulated wood box would.

The stuff comes on rolls, about three feet wide by several yards
long (1m x 10m) or so.  Home Depot, Lowe's, etc, carry it.

I hope this helps!
