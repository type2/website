I have seen this bus years ago with the previous
owner...almost owned it...it is realllllyyy messed
up...but is indeed a barndoor westy.

Sorry to say it is no-longer the oldest westy in the
world...according to the Barndoor Registry there is an
earlier westfalia in France if I recall...saw pics
somewhere too?

If anyone wants the full low down on this bus...email
me and I will send out my phone number to call for
full details and history...and allll the f-ed up stuff
done to it over the years ;-)
