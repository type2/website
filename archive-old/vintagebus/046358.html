&lt;&lt; My bus is a '65, i couldn't figure out what you meant by the two piesces 
of brass on the outside/forward part of the switch. I soldered all the brass 
tabs that were riveted to the black plastic part.&gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
When VW went to the spade connectors the exterior square post that once was a 
screw connector was machined shorter.  Both the screw and spade terminal 
switches where this squre post goes through the plastic (Bakelite?) body of 
the switch housing.  This square post is machined to a smaller square 
diamensions and on the far rear end had a thin tube machined that later would 
be pressed into a hollow rivet.   To fabricate a male spade connector for 
easy manufacturing purposes they produced these out of brass flat stock with 
a square hole through them.  To install the male spade connectors they just 
slid these on the square post and inserted the square post throught the 
switch body.  The inside spring connector that rides/slides on the switching 
shaft/block inside was installed over the inside/rear end of each post and 
then the tube on the rear of the square shaft was pressed to swedge all these 
parts together.
  So in other words the spade terminal not only has the riveted connection to 
the spring connector that rides/slides on the switching shaft/block inside to 
cause voltage drop, but also where the flat brass spade connectors are pinned 
to the switch body by the forward end of the square brass shafts.  Resulting 
in not only one, but two places where corrosion can take place and cause both 
heat and voltage drop to dim/yellow your head lights! 
Best to put on some flux and solder on where the spade connector and square 
post meet nearest to the center body of the switch as possible.  Once you 
have the solder in this area apply the soldering iron to the farthest outside 
from the square post away from the center line of the switch.  This attracts 
the solder you have just put on the other inside of each square post to be 
sucked/drawn under the lip of the post securely soldering the spade clip to 
it!  Solder has a strange habit to actually follow the heat source that is 
melting it.
 
&lt;&lt;One other question...I only drilled out the two rivets that held the whole 
assembly together...there was a third rivet i  noticed, but i didn't think i 
needed to drill it out.&gt;&gt;
Duh, sorry for the confusion!  Yes, only the two that hold the rear bell 
shaped metal cover onto the switch body!
 
&lt;&gt;
What we do is to make sure the VW is loaded as should be for normal use 
including how many passengers and where seated.  Then go out to darker 
streets at night and adjust the low beams to illuminate the pavement ahead to 
cover about 20 to 40 feet ahead, and about 2 feet wider than the average lane 
on the highway.  This results in not blinding oncoming cars and lights up the 
lane paint stripes well enough to see them even when the pavement is slick 
with water that reflects oncoming cars lights all to well into your eyes 
which causes the paint strips to dissappear to easily if your headlights are 
too high.  
  This should result in the high beam headlights to shoot out parallel over 
in relation to the roadway spreading out and illuminating the way down a 
straightway and out well to both sides of the road so you can spot deer and 
other objects way ahead when no opposing traffic oncoming on dark backroads.
