Subject: Re: [VB] Flipseat westies

Personal involvement in accident rollover while driving flipseat bus:  Back
of seat broke away, rendering 3-point seatbelt useless.  Nearly fell onto
roadway (driver's side) through smashed forward open door.   Recommend
creating brackets or temp bracing for securing seat back while driving.

  They were made out of walkthrough buses, not bench seat buses, which
changes the structurality.

I don't think the flipseat westies give much back support in case of an
accicent.
