Subject: Reccomendation, rear sign-age.

If I recall correctly someone on the list had said that they put a sign on
the rear of their bus to help people identify that they were a slow vehicle
(E &amp; B?).

Finding myself with a 40hp motor, I am reluctant to go above 60mph.

So, I'm thinking that I want to paint a sign on the back of my vehicle.

SLOW VEHICLE
Please just pass safely, thanks!

what do you think?

Maybe I'll put some reflective tape on their too!
