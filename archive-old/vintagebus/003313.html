Subject: Spindle install q Shim source?

After about a month of them being off, I finally got spindles of stock
height. Shimming is weird, with 3 inner and 4 outer? My offset is almost
perfectly 5.5 to 6 on each side. Totally wrong shimming according to
Bentley. Any place to get just shims, not a whole link pin set?
Also, I needed to use a jack to raise the lower torsion arm up to get
the pins even close to go in. The pins were very tight trying to go into
the eyes, now I understand I must correctly shim first, but can I open
up the 'eyes' of the torsion arms with a pry bar? Everything is well
greased, and it is impossible to be even close without jack pressure.
Bentley says not to put the link pin caps on until spindle is installed.
Does this imply I can whack with a rubber deadblow on the link pin to
install these? BFHing seems immennent to get this done.
