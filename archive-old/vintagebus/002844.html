One thing you should know is that I am in Arizona. And I'm still bitching.
Any vintage man in AZ would still like to see a 50's bus saved regardless of
condition.

I merely said to the guy &quot;this is a Vintage list for discussion of Vintage
material&quot; and the guy got pissed. Sounds like he's received slack before
&gt;from ppl saying   &quot;wtf are you doing?!?!&quot;  many times and got easily
offended. I didn't tell him that his stuff is junk.
Yes, Arizona is a perfect spot for dry busses, but I continually hear ppl
getting upset due to some guy doing major alterations. &quot;Why not get a 70's
bus to drop that beautiful Camaro motor in&quot;.... So what does that say? It
says they're getting harder to find in decent condition (50's) and that they
shouldn't have the &quot;treatment&quot; done to them. As you said, everyday, ppl are
draggin buses back east to eventually rot away, which means the bus count is
going down yearly. Of course I agree that some buses aren't worth the effort
to be restored, so what about using it to make another vintage bus better?
If it's not safe enuff to be turned back into a driver(due to rust) or used
for metal parts on another bus, then you can bet its REALLY not safe to see
just how strong it will hold up when that big clock Chevy motor is haulin
ass down the road. The thing I really don't get, is why I'm discussing
whether putting a Chevy motor in a 50's bus is &quot;against ethics&quot; or not. Is
this not the place where the hardcore vintage ppl hang, hence the list name?

I'm not being judgmental...I know he's screwed in the head :)

&gt;We have a mechanic at our shop who is going to put a rotary mazda rx7
&gt;motor in his old 56 bus. It is a hulking shell, and one I would part and
&gt;cut up and haul away the left-overs.
&gt;
&gt;Do we know that the 59 in question is some kind of show piece that needs
&gt;to be saved by ( and I include myself here) by us stock/vintage
&gt;hardcores?  If not, what the hell. The buses were cheap to begin with,
&gt;and made to be modified. I know of a couple nice f_at_rd engined buses I
&gt;would own if the price was right. I wouldn't do it myself, cuz thats not
&gt;my thing, but it can be done right.
&gt;I see a lot of the sarcasm coming from the folks in the midwest. I used
&gt;to live in Wisconsin, and I remember how scarce old buses are there.
&gt;&quot;Round here  in Oregon there are still enough that a non-perfect example
&gt;can be modified without too many bus nazis getting bent outta shape.
&gt;Remember, the reason they are so scarce in the rust belt is because of
&gt;the salt. You folks already ruined a whole lot more buses than any chevy
&gt;mechanic with a wild hair up his ass....with your road salt.  :) I know
&gt;folks around here wont sell a nice vintage vehicle eastward, because
&gt;they see it as a waste to the eventual deterioration that that region
&gt;brings.
&gt;
&gt;But then, the folks in Arizona and Socal ( and even Idaho) complain
&gt;about the buses they have gotten from Oregon and Washington, because
&gt;compared to these dry spots, Pcaific Northwest buses are also rusty and
&gt;not worth restoring...
&gt;
&gt;So I guess my point is, weather it is ruining a restorable and vintage
&gt;rig to do something like put chevy power under the decklid, or just
&gt;turning a piece of rusty crap into something fun, is very much relative
&gt;to your perspective.
&gt;
&gt; Lets not be too judgemental.
