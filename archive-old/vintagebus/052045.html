Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

No photo, and since my camera was stolen in Seattle, I don't have a way
to take one just yet.  It's a simple little set-up, though, and it works
OK, but I don't like the idea of bending my arms.  Besides, since moving
to the PNW, if my wipers are on the bus, chances are I won't be opening
the safari's.  In the meager excuse for summer, I do keep them in the
parcel tray, though, just in case.  

The only other thing I can say is the 66-67 wiper arm deals are a little
harder to adjust to keep your wiper blades only on the glass, and since
they cause the wiper arm to sit lower on the shaft,  it gets closer to
the indentation on the nose.  On some cases it hits the body, just enough
to take some paint with it.  As was the case on the passenger side.  

Hope this helps!

Adam
