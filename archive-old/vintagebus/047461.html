&lt;&lt; So I got my front wheel off there is grease all over my break shoes!  The
 shoes have very few miles on them so I kinda hate to through em away.  Is it
 possible to clean them?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Jdd,
If they are not too worn or delaminating or just falling apart you can reuse 
greasy/oilly or soked with brake fuild brake shoes and clutch discs by 
degreasing them with Brakleen from CRC.  Use this chemical outside and keep 
it off your skin, it degreases so well it will cause your skin to dry out and 
peel painfully!  Lay down some newspaper to catch the drippings, use a paper 
towel or rag to remove the excess grease/oil on the item, hang the part by a 
coat hanger or something simular and spray until the oil/grease dripps off 
onto the newspaper.  Then set part aside and let dry.  
  We always carry a can of this chemical for this purpose and to knock out 
wasp nests in VWs in wrecking yards.  The wasps die instantly!  No nasty 
writhing dieing wasps to play with when you are trying to get that part out!
