Subject: Re: Air system(heating) and engine cooling

Matt Said....

&gt;How is the air cooling/heating system made up in a bus? Where are the 
vents or
&gt;the buttons to control the air? Where does the heat come from? 
Heat exchangers that blow air around the exahaust pipes basically.

How come my dad
&gt;says that they are hard to heat in the winter?

Drafty, not well sealed buses, with the added problem that cold air is 
heated with the above concept.
&gt;
&gt;How is the engine kept cool? 
Through air and oil. A fan pushes air over the heads and through an oil 
cooler. The air over the heads is very simular to the way a motorcycle 
keeps cool.


Are their vents on the outside?
Air vents (to let air in) are on the outside of a bus.

&gt;
&gt;Does the small engine of the bus have any drawbacks? My friends at 
school say
&gt;that 51 HP wouldn't even budge it! What other size engines are their 
for the
&gt;bus? Whats the top speed of the bus on a flat surface.....or goin up a 
hill?
You can make or buy a bigger engine, but the life expectancy of that 
motor is usually less.
Later model busses are at 65 generally, (up to 1971) and earlier models 
vary greatly. My 63 has a tranny that allows it 65.
Uphill? How steep the hill?
Most passes (like mountains passes) happen in 3rd gear at 40 mph.

For your sake, and perhaps your busses sake, read about them. Buy a book 
or browse at a library. No a bus probably wont smoke tires, or race up 
hills. What you get is room for lots of people, ability to carry a ton 
(literally) of weight, and if a camper a nice place to sleep. In my 
younger days, going to a party was the perfect situation for a bus to 
shine. I didn't drive away after drinking, and people hung out inside 
when it rained. 

BIG NOTE: A volkswagen bus is a wonderful thing but YOU MUST KNOW how to 
care for an antique! You will be required to know how to repair and 
maintain an old car! I can't stress this enough. If you don't want the 
hassle, but want a VAN get a VAN.
