&lt;&lt; I told him I had $50 cash extra for him if he
 did a extra good job.
 Final cost was $550 w/bribe. &gt;&gt;

I hate to admit it, but back when I had a few bucks in my pocket, it was 
really easy to get good service by the bribe method.  Does this say something 
about our service economy, or are people just really lazy without incentive?
