Please do not use the graphic in question. In the first place I'm not sure
we own it, it was created by Jean-Baptiste le Pesant for us and there is no
extant written agreement as to its use so permission may not be ours to
give.

In the second place we have traditionally asked people not to use that logo
so we can reserve it for &quot;official&quot; list merchandise in the event that we
have to sell merchandise in order to stay on the air. We'll cross the
Jean-Baptiste bridge if we come to it. 8)

You didn't ask for advice, but rather than chanting &quot;down with Satan!&quot; I
think your time would be better spent organizing a legal defense fund, no
matter how modest it might be. There are a lot of domains you can't save,
but there are also borderline cases you probably can, if VW's lawyers
discover that you may be capable of defending them in a surgical way. IAC
you aren't going to help anybody with rhetorical graffiti like this. Ben,
the threads on RAMVA amount to a seminar of morons; they have got every
precept of copyright law wrong and are not ashamed to demonstrate it loudly
in public. It is not constructive to  further inflame these people.

type2 and vintagebus subscribers: please think of this as an administrivia
message, it DOES NOT require an on-list response. Thanks.
Anticipating--type2_dot_com has not heard a peep from VWOA over its domain
name.

&gt;I am asking if I can use your graphic from the right frame on
&gt;www.type2_dot_com , and shrink it down, to use as a watermark for a &quot;Ban
&gt;VWoA&quot; webring logo.
&gt;
&gt;I am creating the webring in response to all the posts recently on the
&gt;newsgroup rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled about how VWoA is cracking down
&gt;on VW websites that use the words &quot;volkswagen, VW, Beetle&quot;...etc.  It
&gt;turns out they are trademarked.  We think this is ridiculous.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know if it is OK if I use your graphic in a smaller form.
