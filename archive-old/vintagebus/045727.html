Hi Jeff,    In a message dated 98-09-08 02:16:05 EDT, you wrote:

&lt;&lt; I have a question concerning the replacement of my 1500 engine with a
rebuilt
 1600, possibly a turn key.  (single port or duel port) Most of my components,
 carb etc.. seem to be at the end of the road.&gt;&gt;
 
&lt;&lt; 1.) 	Pros/Cons of a S.P. / D.P.?&gt;&gt;
Single port will get a couple of HP less than DP, but are thicker and the
intake manifold and single carb are simpler and easier to work on.  Dual port
has two extra rubber seals that can go bad and lean out that head causing that
head to burn out.  Also harder to work on two of the spark plugs due to the
manifold in the way somewhat.  Plus DP heads are thinner castings and often
crack when driven hard and then shut down before the engine cools thus the
heads to cool unevenly without the fan running and this causes the heads to
crack.  While you could order the special DP heads that have been made with
thicker castings and then you have to run special longer plugs and higher cost
for the thicker heads.
 
&lt;&lt; 2.)	I'd like to find a rebuilt 1500, yet I am looking for this swap to be
as
 $$ painless as possible. I would like the outward appearance of the engine to
 be as close to stock as possible.&gt;&gt;
What you might want to do is to buy a dual relief long block and do as much as
you can to rebuild it yourself.  Then when you have the new 1600 dual relief
long block rebuilt just take all of the cooling tin from you original engine
and use it on the new rebuilt engine.  Finding the 1500cc tin is getting hard
to find and this way you can take a little time finding it while having a
reliable engine now.
 
&lt;&lt; 3.)	Is the existing offset air filter etc. compatible with a 1600 setup ?
What
 about sticking with the non doghouse oil cooler?  Cooling tin conversion
 problems?&gt;&gt;
Well if you intend to just drive your bus and not drag race it over 4,500 RPM
then the air cleaner will work fine.  Right now we are using a earlier 1200cc
pre-1964 aircleaner on a 1641cc single port dual relief case engine and are
having no problems.
 
 &lt;&lt;4.)	I am somewhat new to this bus stuff, my 1500 is old and tired (told by
 P.O. she is on her 3rd rebuild), any tips on where to find a good rebuilt
 engine would be helpful.  Money is somewhat an issue,  but I do need to drive
 her on a regular basis. Trying to keep that &quot; original&quot; look about her. &gt;&gt;
If money is a issue then it is even more you should rebuild your engine as
much as you can yourself.  Start talking to local volks and finding possible
places to get work you can not do (Grinding crank, boring the case and
rebuilding the heads, etc.), done.
Good luck, take your time and do it right,   Eric &amp; Barb
