Hey folks..

Just got back from most of a week out of town today and checked back into
the apparent upstream broken cache server issue. (the two servers on this
line were having identical problems: requests were making it IN, but only
few were making it /out/...to me it felt like a misconfigured reverse wccp
cache. btdt.)

The other server appeared to be working fine, so i put the type2_dot_com
server back on port 80 where it belonged and did some testing through the
day.

As best as I can tell, it is functioning properly again. (thanks to Matt
for catching one bit i missed.)


so, surfs up!

....david
