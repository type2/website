&lt;&lt; Hey, anybody know how make some sort 
of contraption so you can rip the  suspension 
out or your bus and still be able to move it 
around? &gt;&gt;

Kymco makes their version of the old VW
locally made tool from the dark ages.  Pretty
much it bolts to the frame horns and is a big
plate with an equally big caster on it.  This
allowed the swingaxled cars to me moved 
around the shop with the trans out.
