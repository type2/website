Subject: RE:Rhino Liner

Rhino Liner is a base floor and belly pan paint.  It should be
applied before primer on the underside, like an undercoating.
But it is a paint, very thick, dries to a wrinkle pattern, like a 
rhino skin.  Very tough, very resistant to chips from rocks, 
sound deadening.  My painter (who, BTW, may be one of the 
best guys in Northern Cal for hot rods and restorations) got
me to use it on the cargo area floor and the complete underside
after stripping the tar-based undercoating.  He says the sandwich
of rhino liner, steel floor, and rhino liner should cut the cabin
noise to a very low level.  I should hear very little road roar
from undercarriage.

That along with Stinger Sound Absorbent spray in the gas tank 
cavity and under the rear seat, as well as in the wall cavities, 
should give me a very quiet listening chamber for my musical
enjoyment while crusing America's beautiful highways and national
parks and monuments.

&gt; &gt;POR15 if your patching, Rhino liner if your rebuilding, IMHO.
