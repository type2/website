&gt;Boy,   I thought finding an icebox here in the States is hard.  How'd ya
like to be stuck on an island trying to find Westy parts??

Steve,

Are you sure you really want it?  Unless you are a big resto buff, I would
leave it out.  The way a splitty's cargo doors are configured, it is a
major PITA every time cargo passengers want to get out.  I prefer the ice
chest route as they can be removed and left outside when you get where you
need to be.  If I were you, I would look for a roof rack and use two ice
chests...one for food and one for drinks (I hate soggy food, too). 

 Why do you think these fridge units are missing in the first place?  I can
just picture someone loosing patience with them in the middle of the
night....slamming on the brakes......EERRRRT.......&quot;_at_#$_at_#%
fridge!!!&quot;....mutter....mutter.....(chunking it into a field of cows) to
never be seen again.
