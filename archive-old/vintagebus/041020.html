Subject: Bay window seat and new engine case  for sale

I have posted the following 2 ads on VW Planet:

I have a full sized middle seat from a Bay window bus. The seat is in good
condition with only 2 small tears. One is ~ 1 inch and the other is smaller
than that. Please see the pictures on my site at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/single_cab/bayseat.html

Unfortunately I can't ship this item so you will have to pick it up in the
Bay area.


I have an unused 1600 CC case from CB performance. It is a Mexican made
AS41. It has been sitting for a while and is in need of a good cleaning but
is otherwise in new condition. This is the type that has the welded
reinforcement for #3 cylinder. I think they call it a panzer case or
something like that. It has been opened up for 2110cc (90.5 bore x 82mm
stroke) I will ship this item upon payment or you can pick it up from my
house. Buyer pays actual shipping costs.

Please look at the pictures on my site and call if you are interested. I
would like to see this case go to good use:)

You can see pictures of this case at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/single_cab/enginecase.html

If you are interested please reply, off list, to me at tainlay_at_home_dot_com

Thanks,

Thomas
