&gt;How often are you running from the police?

&gt;JP

Only when absolutely necessary. See any writing by Hunter S Thompson. (bus content: HST quotes are on dog series ale labels from the Denver brewery that also makes Fat Tire Ale found at many Type 2 campouts near Kyle's Westfailure.)

Along that note, the Supreme Court recently decided to allow authorities to apprehend suspects only because they're running away from the police. 

Almost Famous... I browsed the confusing official movie website and saw only a Greyhound bus. Link to it from www.imdb_dot_com .

&lt;&lt; Just heard of new law enforcement technology that can shut off a car's 
fuel supply from a pursuit vehicle. No details yet, but probably only works 
on newer cars. Another reason to drive an old VW bus.  &gt;&gt;
