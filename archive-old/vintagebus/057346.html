&gt; Why would white be any different than any other color? If you are wanting to

&gt; encasing the heat, not reflecting it, or at least reflecting back into the
&gt; inside of the block because of the insulating qualities of paint itself.

Physics lesson coming!  Run Away!

Colors that are good heat absorbers are also good heat radiators.  To
understand this, think of an imaginary material that was a good emitter
but a poor absorber.  It would emit lots of heat but absorb little, which
would make it colder than its environment, which is a no-no.

If you had another theoretical material that absorbed better than it
emitted, this material would be hotter than its environment.

Now, if you have something that is hotter than its environment and you
want to cool it off, it pays to have it painted with a high-emissivity
color (like black).  OTOH, if you have something that is colder than the
environment and you want to keep it cold (like a ice chest) you would want
it to be painted in a low absorbance color, such as white.

Black engine = good
White ice chest = good
