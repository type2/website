Subject: Re: [VB] Plans wanted

&gt;I'm not sure, maybe Rex knows what year his came from

Mine was a late bay....'79 I believe. And I'm not even sure if it was 
westy. I got it free and had to hurry. I'm not a camper guy. It had 
the roof that popped up at an angle. SEEMS like it said westfalia on 
the roof, but I really can't remember. I'm just bummed now 'cause the 
guy said I could have the whole bus. The T4 2000cc engine was already 
out and I should've grabbed it...but at the time I had no plans to do 
a T4 conversion. Oh well.

&gt;For me the set-up is perfect, if I had a camper then I would need a separate
&gt;bus to hual stuff and be a daily driver, this set up fill both needs.

Same exact thing for me. I really do think if you've got a beater bus 
that's missing the whole interior, or you just don't want stock, you 
should grab a baywindow Z-Bed. When mine's in the seat position, it 
actually feels like a plush couch or something. SOOOO comfertable. 
Now when I decide to make that drive to Ennis, TX on May 7th, me and 
the wife will have a nice comfy bed to crash in for the night.

&quot;if this bus is rockin, don't bother knockin&quot;....you can bet on it buddy!
