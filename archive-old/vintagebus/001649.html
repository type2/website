Hello, I am introducing myself and am new to the list as I procured a 67
singlecab. My name is Jeremiah and I live in Gainesville, FL.  If any of you
are near and have parts/drink beer coffee or water/ do your own work/etc,
feel free to say hi.  This truck is a functional one and will not be
returning to show specs soon if ever. It runs well now that I sealed the
intake joints where the boots were leaking gas out the huge cracks! imagine
how much air waas being sucked in after the carb tried to do its job!
Replaced points,condensor,plugs, and heater pipes.  It has a 72 Beetle DP
1600. The muffler must be from a later bus up to 71 and heater pipes from
the 1500 that came in the truck because the diameter of the pipes where they
met up were about 1/4&quot; in difference and the half baked clamps did little to
no good.  The muffler was ok so I stayed cheap and just got some J-tubes.
After stripping one of the holes the stud came out of and breaking the other
stud(with heat, but maybe not enough penetrant), I extracted the broken one
and helicoiled the other and zippo, quiet exhaust!....ahhhhh........  .  The
other day I left the lights on,ran the battery dead, and the accelerator
cable snapped when I was trying to push start it(&quot;huh?.......wha happen to
da pedal?&quot;). I took that noisy pan under the cabin floor I had been meaning
to, thought it just cam unhooked, looked in the rear and saw it was severed.
I pulled it out, walked to automotive, they had no help. I thought of a
sinker type thing for temp, bummed a ride to Discount A and got some bail
wire and elect connectors, put the old one together, broke my arse snaking
it back through(got caught on the rubber part, froze as I had to remove my
nice shirt leaving only a Tee, and got nice and greased up. Got ready and
pushed the pedal, it immediately seperated. I pulled it back out and put the
wire through, rigged it and drove home.  Drove on it 3 days and nights like
that and put the new one in today. The one that broke was a single wire, the
replacement is too long, but twined wires, oh well, it works well enough for
a short trip and around town.

I also checked the steering box today. How do you calculate the time based
on inches of schmutz covering the adjusting nut and screw?
It helped but I need all four tierod ends. Does anyone have any advice about
special tools or to buy German or other when it comes to replacement? TIA

I think the only other things other than oil change is a pressure wash and
Os-pho treatment that continues. I need to get a good split and/or truck
shop manual which one is best for someone who can only afford one right now?
How do you adjust the brakes? Is it inside the drums or through the backing
plates? I just looked real quick and found no holes on my rear backing
plates.  What kind of interiors did the trucks have? I put a thinline carpet
on the panels which are homemade and beige now.  The painted areas cleaned
up well, but there are two additional guage holes now empty and the radio
hole altered about 1/4&quot; in a place on the bottom, and what looks like a
clock hole next to the radio?(to the right). For music, I bought a Sony
boombox. The CGF-950 or something, it has esp on the CD, weather proof, and
plugs into a 12v car or baot socket without a DC inverter! I love it! For
camping,working, or what ever I can just pull it out on the roof or
something and have music, as well as just pulling it out from theives. I
plan on puting a utility socket like this on both sides of the cargo area
and another inside the engine compartment for lights,radios,etc. Well folks,
more later, and thankyou for listening, it is a pleasure being in the
community again.
