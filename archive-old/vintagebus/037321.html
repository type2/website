&lt;&lt; Why don't these folks that are so concerned about the sigla logog, just

into a small screen to be screenprinted on or a vinyl mask and used to
paint one on. But I suppose that wouldn't be good enough for the vintage
nazis, eh??!!

Good enough for me!
I've been looking for the correct thickness of glass for three years, havent
