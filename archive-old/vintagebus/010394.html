Hey Volks

While looking for info for a listee, I was digging through my VW literature
and came across Service Bulletin Z12 (Feb 62) &quot;Installation Instructions for
the Breakdown Truck&quot;.

I quote:
&quot;The vehicle is supplied in certain colors and lettered as shown in the
pictures so that it will become a symbol of speedy assistance to customers
throughout the worldwide VW Service Organisation. The special paint finish
and lettering is listed under SK No 1059.

&quot;The following equipment is supplied from the factory under M No 225:
200 Watt generator
88Ah battery
Spot light
Reversing lamp
Emergency light (yellow)
Eberspacher stationary heater
Towing hook front and rear
Trailer attachment
Chrome plated wheel caps
Interior mirror
Socket on cab rear panel for spot light
Fluorescent lamp&quot;

Unfortunately it doesn't name the colours and it's impossible to know from
the B&amp;W pics. My gues would be dove blue bus with roof and body stripes in
yellow and bumper stripes in red and white (reflective?).

Check some of the cooool pics I posted on Thom's site:

Has anyone ever seen one of these babies? Any of you DC owners got M225?
