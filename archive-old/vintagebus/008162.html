Adam,
 I'm surprised at you, you're not a west-coaster, I'd think anything you
couldn't see through would be appealing.
Sitting in Northern Illinois, that bus is $1,750 in the bank easy.
As long as a magnet sticks to the side, somebody's gonna want it.
Add shipping from the left coast and things get a little more critical.
