Subject: Sealing fuel tanks - option

Wouldn't POR be just for the OUTSIDE of the tank?!? For the *inside* you
might try something that my hubby used on his race bike.  He had an aluminum
fuel cell fabbe'd for his bike and after a race or two, was having some
leakage through stress cracks on the welds. Don't need that!! You're already
taking enough risks on the track w/ out leaking tanks! &lt;grin!&gt;

A tank sealer product worked perfectly, it's called Kreem - found it at
Kragen's or Grand Auto (some auto parts place like that)
The product is in two parts - a prep solution and then the actual coating
mixture.
You need to clean out the tank as much as possible - find a way to etch the
insides if you have loose debris (rust) to get as smooth &amp; clean a surface
as possible. (rust remover &amp; ball bearings? - maybe some other folks have
good ideas on that part) Then you can use Kreem.

The product is designed to be a solution for pin holes &amp; the like for fuel
tanks. But I believe that if you don't have significant damage - or when
done on a new tank - it ought to prevent interior rust damage since it
effectively gives your tank a plastic lining.

The fuel cell (on the bike) has been in perfect operation for over three
years now &amp; basically looks new (of course aluminum isn't really prone to
rusting...) but still seems like a viable option to me for the busses too.

Hope that helps,
melissa
