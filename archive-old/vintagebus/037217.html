 the saga continues once again, yet I am determined to not loose faith.  I 
 gotta do what I gotta do and learn from what ive screwed up doing.  So here 
 is the latest development:
 
 The trannsaxle whines now.  Only noticable in 3rd and 4th gears.  Let off 
the 
 gas and the while goes away.  Press the clutch in and coast, no whine.  It 
 has gotten rather annoying.
 
 So Wade mentioned that he had the problem and it turned out to be the RGB 
 bearings.  So outside I go.  Grab the drivers side wheel at 12 O'Clock, 
pull, 
 clunk!
 Passenger side seems fine.
 
 So in your opinions could this possibly be an RBG issue?  The tranny acts 
 just fine other than the whine.  Has oil!  I dont notice any unusual 
 vibrations.  No clunking.
 
 anyone?

I think you have two problems- one is the RGBearings, the other the whine.  
Can you live with the whine?   or are you going to get a rebuild so the whine 
goes away?   My bug has had a slight whine in 4th at about 50mph for the last 
40K miles. Guess you better deal with the bearings though.  

I was looking at the RGcover i took off my 61 on the one side- the outer 
upper bearing had gone- fallen apart- pitted little ball bearings dropping 
when I took the cover off- and the upper gear had moved so much that it had 
started chewing into the cover.  That can't have been a good thing.  Do put 
magnetic drain plugs in the bottoms of your RGBoxes.

I know I rabbit on about this 61 sometimes, and I haven't driven it for over 
a year,  but hopefully it'll be back on the road this week.  It really is the 
coolest bus.  61 .  corner windows . no silly roof windows.  safaris to let 
the rain in.  Original paint.  got most of the original trinkets on it.   
ratty and rusty rockers, dented nose.  whoo-yaa!!!
