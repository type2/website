Hi AL,
Yes it can among so many, many things.  Go out a buy a volt/ohmmeter from 
your local hardware store.  We prefer anolog ones and can be had new for less 
than twenty bucks!  Then check from the battery to the ignition switch and 
back the the engine the flow of electricity section by section.  Beware of 
those clamp/bolt on cable repair battery repair clamps!  There is a good 
reason why VW only used battery clamps soldered to the battery cables.
