Subject: Anyone know how Beto is?

Hi all,

I haven't been able to get Beto (type2guy_at_aol_dot_com) on the phone (keep getting
an operator), and he lives down between LA and SD. I don't know for sure how
close he might be to any of the fires, he may be in the clear for all I know,
but I can't get ahold of him. Anyone talked to him in the last week?

Beto, are you reading this? Email or call me if you can.
