Subject: RE: Oil System Upgrades

Roger,
My comments are: install the Doghouse, check the archives (I would say
sermons... bummer) on recommended fittings/hoses for filter, forget the
sump and extra cooler. Check your oil temp in the summer. If you're
still running hot, consider the second cooler, but make sure you're not
masking a bigger problem. 

While you're in there, put in a thermostat and flaps... make 'em work.
If I remember right, you also need different tin on top of the cylinders
for the doghouse shroud, maybe not... measure where they meet. 

I run all over Utah on 100 degree days, sometimes pulling my family and
boat over the hills, and don't show any indication of overheating since
I started running doghouse coolers. (no temp gauge, but dipstick stays
reasonable, engine doesn't knock, and little or no smoke from oil
filler)

&quot;Upgrades&quot; is a subjective term!

&gt; I've been thinking of upgrading the oil system of our '67 and am looking
&gt; for comments.  I'm thinking of adding a sump, then upgrading to the
&gt; doghouse setup from pieces I'm gathering from the local junkyard. Good
&gt; hunting so far - shroud, front tin, cooler, new fan/adapter/seals for
&gt; $60. Next, I want to add the cover plate to the oil pump that allows a
&gt; remote oil filter/cooler. I'll mount a filter next to the left wheel
&gt; well. In the oil filter line I can add a second cooler. I was thinking
&gt; of making a new cover for the doghouse cooler to allow the airflow to -SNIP TO END-
