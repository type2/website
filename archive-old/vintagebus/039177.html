Craig Sauls asked:

&gt;Michael,
&gt;  Are you in Oz by any chance? Never seen such an animal on a crewcab
of any
&gt;vintage here. Perhaps it was a local feature.


Nope. South Africa. But your question got me thinking. Australia and
S.A. have got fairly similar climates overall with some desert and
semi-desert parts getting really hot in the summer so the double airflow
deal was probably a hot climate spec.

That doesn't really work though cause there are large parts of the U.S.
that get as hot.

Now I'm thinking that I haven't explained the airboxes clearly so here
goes nothing. They are mounted to the inside and near the back of both
side gates(so that if you drop the gate the box goes with it leaving a
slot in the bed above the rear of the engine bay). The boxes are about
450mm wide x  150mm deep x a little taller than the gate. The top edge
of the the boxes sticks over the top of the gate by about 100mm and the
opening is covered with mesh.The large flat panel of the boxes has an X
shaped reinforcinc pressing stamped into it. 

These are not DIY add ons as all the Dcabs that I have seen in S.A. with
their gates in place have them. 

I will post my Mcode info on monday for the interest of the tag sleuths.

Later

Michael
