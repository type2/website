Subject: Re: Clutch/trans problem

&gt; From: &quot;Bob Thomas&quot; &lt;bobgthomas_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

&gt; Well I replaced the clutch cable, with no apparent difference.  The pedal is
&gt; soft, with the only spring action appearing to come from the return spring
&gt; on the clutch lever attached to the trans.  This lever seems to travel
&gt; forward easily, a distance of about 2&quot;, and then seems to to a stop.   Does

From your description this sounds like something inside the bell housing,
possibly inthe pressure plate or on the cross shaft that holds the release
bearing.  Two inches of easy travel on that lever doesn't sound right.

I suspect you're going to have to pull the engine.  My bet is one of the
arms on the cross-shaft broke off.  Any nasty noises when engine is
running and you try to operate the clutch?
