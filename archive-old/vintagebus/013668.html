You sure you can't find another spindle?

&gt; Another thought on this spindle thing how did this spendle get to be
&gt; non-reverse thread?

Some yokel switching the nuts side to side, and didn't have the sense
to stop and figger out what was going on when it didn't work?

&gt; My tranny has popped out of *3rd* on long steep up hills about 5 times
&gt; in the last 1000 miles or so. My reverse is ok.

The tranny swan song...
