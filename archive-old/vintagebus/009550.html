So, just to put everybody's mind at ease, little update here.  I ended up
replacing all four front wheel cylinders.  Brakleen'ed the shoes that were
kinda dirty, they all looked ok so I re-used them.  Bled the brakes, etc
etc.

Holy stopping power batman.  Wow.  I'd forgotten what it was like to have
the pedal not be nearly to the floor.  And my usual extreme pull to the left
seems to have gone away.  Yay, no more accidental left turns into oncoming
traffic! ;-)  Mind you, I didn't adjust the back brakes so it may return
after I do that.  I hope not.  It's almost like driving a real car now.

The only thing I noticed was that one of the brake shoes has some cracks in
the lining, not like it's going to fall apart or anything but I'm not sure
how much of a concern this is.  We're talking about a crack about an inch or
two long, running vertically up the middle of the brake shoe.

The old idiot book really doesn't seem to offer much guidance in the
brake-fixing department.  It kinda glossed over everything...  So, thanks to
everyone for their idiot-proof advice.  I'd be lost without ya.
Diana
