Seated Trampoliner’s,

  Just though I’d drop a line since it is raining and I can’t work on the
bus today.

  The underside is almost done, just a few touch ups to do.  The entire
bus was media blasted, POR-15 has been sprayed on (but it was too lightly
applied and burned through), followed by being hand painted with chassis
coat black -&gt; primer -&gt; chassis coat black.  The body was sprayed with
P)R-15 followed by a top coat of metallic silver. All windows ledges were
painted with many coats of POR-15 followed by the metallic silver.  I’m
putting 2 sets of jalousie gaskets on the windows.  All the windows
(except the vent windows) are in.  The safari’s and the jealousies have a
clear coat.  The safari’s do not open without breaking the vent window
latch.  The Preval spray cans have come in handy in touching up and
painting the interior, since you don’t need to paint much since everything
is covered up by the wood.

   The torsion bars and spring plated were installed and the tie-downs
were a big help.  I also used a third tie-down to pull the spring plates
on the tubes, so I didn’t need any oversized bolts.  I’m having problems
in getting the shifting tube mid-section apart, I think I’ll try propane
heat next.

  Brakes: New master cylinder, hardware, brake lines and slaves, new
riveted pads, and brake drums that look new are yet to be put on.

  Transsexual: rebuilt redux boxes will be complete when I get the bearing
from Ronnie later on this week.

   Electrical: New harness and reconditioned fuse box are ready to be
installed.

  Wipers:  rebuilt my motor (the grease turned into crusty-snot glue
inside the gears) POR-15 arms, waiting on the safari shafts to be made.

  Interior: Bought 3.5” fiberglass with foil backing, snaked new wire for
side lights in.  Cleaning wood.  Using Rustoleum Vinyl paint to do
interior white handles, knobs, visors to match color scheme.  Overhead
wood, side wood, corner wood, door wood, parquet floor, seats, curtains,
and my custom interior are going in soon.
 
  Motor;: have painted new exhaust and heater boxes, existing motor has
less than 1K on it so it should be OK after a carb cleaning.

  The race against winter is on, hope to finish in a month if everything
goes well.

Best,
joe
