Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator light

OK, so I've grounded the wire and nothing happens.  I've checked the
connectors on both ends and they are good.  At this point do I have to run a
new wire from the engine to the dash?

&gt;I don't think I can follow the same procedures as for a generator 
&gt;with seperate regulator (i.e. grounding the wire to see if the
&gt;light comes on...if so, bad regulator or its ground).

The warning light wiring is exactly the same.  So, pull the warning
light wire off of the alternator, ground it, and turn the key on.
If the light comes on, the trouble is in your alternator; if the
light doesn't come on you have a burned-out bulb or a bad wire
somewhere.
