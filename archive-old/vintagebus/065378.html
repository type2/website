Subject: Re: [VB]  A dumb question

I've used the Radio Shlock speaker of the same form factor with good
results.  If you're using an original-era radio, the QOS will be about right.

&gt; Thanks for all who replied, I don't know why it didn't cross my mind that
&gt; would be where the speaker was. Now off to find an orginal speaker out of an
&gt; old bus in the junkyard. I bet that is gonna be impossible! I haven't went out
&gt; and looked yet up under my dash, I wonder how it hooked up? And what size the
&gt; speaker is. I will figure it out.
