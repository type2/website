Subject: Re: [VB] Spongebob bus source?

&gt;&gt;has anybody found the Matchbox 5 pack of Spongebob
Squarepants vehicles, including the Splitty? &lt;&lt;


They were plentiful at our local Wallyworld when I bought my 3 sets! I
would be glad to  pick some up, but I'm in Indiana. If someone is
desperate enough to pay the UPS I don't have a problem doing it. I can
ship UPS from work real easy. They are pretty cool, that pink Dakota that
is one of the 5 in the set, defines butt ugly!
