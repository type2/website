&gt; your gonna &quot;blast&quot; the engine at the do it yourself car wash? is this a good 
&gt; idea? lots of stuff that really shouldnt get wet in there. get some simple 
&gt; green and a few rolls of paper towels.
&gt; 

I do the self service car wash on my engine.     And simple Green= I spray the SG on liberally around the engine compartment and inside the decklid and under the motor and at the fins by the push rod tubes and around the valve covers and drive in, pop the engine lid leaving engine running, spray under neath, point up at the bottom of the cylinders to clear out the fins. and around the engine compartment and at the motor- 

avoid hittinng the paper air tubes and do not spray directly at the distributor or down the throat of the air cleaner

if it stalls out, turn off the ignition, pop the dist cap, and clean it out w/ a clean dry rag or paper towel.

Some places may have rules against doing this- so stanadrd disclaimer.  

A clean engine runs cooler, and is nicer to work on. I haven't washed mine in over a year, but it's still pretty good, not greasy much.
