To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Saturday I dressed out the stashed SP1600 longblock
and have it 80% complete toward a full engine. As the
stores reopen I will complete the thing. Also fixed a
few other things on the beast.
Price still remains the same $1500 obo.

So, '66 std with nice camper interior, complete engine
and fixed tranny, good brakes, new tires and
appropriate glass all around. $1500.
Call for info on any other items that you are looking
for as I will be clearing out my garage full of stash.
Some cool stash some basic trash. Ya never know until
you are looking for it.
Am kicking around the idea of selling off my trusty
'63 daily EZ camper as well. I thump it at least 50
miles roundtrip per day. Will reinstall interior prior
to sale. All (I mean *ALL*) systems have been redone
since I have owned it. Will post it with photos when
the time comes.

I'm disgusted to the point of selling off all of my
chit and getting a $2000. POS Toyota truck and calling
it &quot;good&quot;.
