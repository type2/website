Subject: [VB] Water Injection  ???
Message-ID: &lt;3845F0DD.6EEB_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

Here is one for the grizzled old salts on the list:

I was reading through my old Hot VW's and found in June 1981 a section
on building a &quot;water injection system&quot; for an aircooled vw engine.

They drill a hole in the solex carb and fit it with a water jet, and set
it to a very accurate :P 40 drops per minute. They say you can set
timing another 3 to 5 degrees advanced, and save 25% in fuel economy.

Now if this was the april edition, I would have said April Fools to you
too. 

Anyone ever heard of this? Done this? 

It figures, the tech article's author is an Oregonian.
