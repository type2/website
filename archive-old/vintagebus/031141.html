Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] What, a stud?

&lt;&lt;
Seriously, any old 8mm stud should be OK as long as it's the right
length. I usually put red locktite on exhaust studs that come out. I
haven't had that problem since I started using stainless nuts, though. I

know some folks use brass nuts too. I think the main thing is to just
not use plain steel so the stud and nut don't rust together.&gt;&gt;

If my memory serves me, the brass nuts can be found through a Toyota
dealer. I think that was in a Bob Hoover post a long long time ago.
