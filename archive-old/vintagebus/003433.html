Hi Everyone, I would like to make some room in my storage area, so I am
putting some seats up for sale. (front, middle rear) Email with needs. The
seats are presently in Toronto, but I may soon be making a trip to the
Allentown PA area. If you need some seats, and are along the way, or not too
far off, let me know.......
Thanks,
Michael Moore
