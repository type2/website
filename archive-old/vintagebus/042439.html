&gt; Don't the mid 59 to 63 front tranny mounts have slightly smaller studs? Would 
&gt; this cause the tranny to slip up and down a bit during hard driving/shifting, 
&gt;  or would tighting the bolts down hold it in place? 

the studs on the torsion housing that the mount bolts to are the same.
The difference is in teh size of teh studs that go from the mount to the
tranny.  So as long as you have the right mount for the transaxle, it will
bolt up the same to the body.

hope that helps,

Steve
