Subject: Doliwa book

Gotta love Babelfish...

Brief description  Bulli Bible as the Volkswagenwerk in the late year 1990
the new transporter T4 with front wheel drive presented, went one era to
end: The new Bulli fallow with the sanctified tradition of the rear
propulsion, after four decades erased VW also the last beetle Relikt. The
first Bulli, the transporter on beetle base, had become beside the
knubbeligen sedan to the symbol of the restaurant miracle and belonged in
innumerable body forms and variations to the streetscape. The carriers with
tail engine are in the meantime long already legend, more still: They
became the cult. And each cult needs its Bible. Stefan Doliwas transporter
book has that things in addition: It created, which possible even experts
wanted to consider not quite and could classify and list the most important
model modifications at transporters and penalties after search for many
years. Differences after engine, chassis, electrical connection and body
Doliwa calls the accurate field data, lists chassis and part numbers and
offers such after model years an arranged standard work, which will equally
inspire restorers such as bus fans: The one by its information abundance,
which others by the numerous detail pictures - whole like it for a Bible is
right oneself.

                                                               Over the
author Stefan Doliwa, class 1970, is machine-builder and Kfz technician. As
eight-year old it screwed awaked its passion for the Volkswagen bus for the
first time at a beetle, soon thereafter. Their it remained faithful until
today.

Shipping would likely make these unobtainable from OG-land... any known US
source?

Craig, whose passion is really screwed awake about this book!!!!
