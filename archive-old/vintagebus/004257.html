A plastic box on the Safari's or on the radio, or on the whole bus?

There's gotta be some kind of material that can seal the many surfaces
of a Safari window (or popout). A clear, viscous 'grease' that keeps the
water out and allows the windows to be opened without leaving the
vehicle. Vasoline? Something thicker.... hmmm. K-Y is water soluble.
Keg-Lube, available to home-brewers, is clear, waterproof. A bit thin
and dirt sticks to it. Maybe in the cracks only and not used as a caulk.
We'll try it and report back. Anybody else have an idea?

I'm asses &amp; elbows putting this DC together. Torn CV boot, half a Hoover
Bit, wiring, interior panels, emergency calls to work, food, and sleep
are the only obstacles at this point. See you at the OCTO, look for the
orange-yellow DoubleCab. I'm buying every listee a pint at JT Schmid's,
a brewpub near the Duckpond.
