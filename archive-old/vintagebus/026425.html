Hello Friends,

I'm looking to do a re-bush on my swing lever. I checked out the type2
library and found an article about the procedure. The author (whose name
evades me at the moment, my apologies) did not find it necessary to use
the reamer in his successful installation.

My question: How many of you have done this, and how many of you had to
use the reamer? P-mail, please...

david
