thats called an attatchment.  it goes with every message he sends to whomever he
sends it to.  it is sort of a FYI type of thing.  It is on his posts to the list
and there is nothing wrong with that as all of steve's other posts are bus
related....and at the bottom is just a thing saying &quot;hey..if you're
interested...i've this for sale&quot; and thats all.  he didn't post a single message
advertising just that for sale.

we all know this thread will get killed, and is off topic in itself, so lets
kill it now...ok?

thank you,
Isaiah &amp; Stella

by the way...has anyone had any body work done on their split at a professional
shop? if so...email me... I'm intrested in what its going to cost and how i
should go about doing it.

&gt; &gt; this is NOT why i subscribe to this list, toyotas suck.  if i wanted to
&gt; &gt; read about toyotas i'd subscribe to a toyota list.
