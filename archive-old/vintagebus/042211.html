&gt; Joe,
&gt;   When I was at Radio Shack picking up the $29 am/fm 
&gt; cassette a listee posted about (thanks), I saw a antenna 
&gt; that might work for you. It is the tape kind that you 
&gt; stick to a window. I am going to put it under the dash 
&gt; from end to end. The counter guy said they work well so 
&gt; we will see.

If you have strong signals in your area, an on-glass antenna will work
pretty well.  However, there is a penalty if you go to a weaker signal
area.

There are exceptions, but the typical Radio Shack counter guy is about as
knowledgeable as the counter itself.  I've heard so much BS spewed by
those guys (Example:  Telling a man that their 2-meter amateur radio
handheld required no license and could transmit on CB frequencies) that I
try not to listen at all.
