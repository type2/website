Does anyone know what the correct jack would be for my 1955 Kombi?

I saw a very early Bilstein Jack, and was wondering if it was correct.  It
had 3 rows of characters on the top as such:
Bilstein
VIGOT
Bunch of #s

There was a ball bearing in the 'G' of VIGOT.  It was a very pretty jack. :)

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
