GL-5 bad. GL-4 good.  Or so say the trans builders I trust. Take it back
before you open it and get gl-4 (not gl-4-5-6 or any other combination)
and 90 weight. Has to do with how the synchros work. It is much nicer to
shift with the right stuff.

Redline MT-90 is also very nice if you can afford it.

You need a bit less than 3 quarts in the center, and a pint in each
redux box... I usually buy 5 quarts total and put it all in a nice
pumper, makes it so much nicer to put in. 
When you do the boxes, manually  turn (as in move, not machine)  the
drums as you add it, allowing it to get by the gears. Then re-check the
center section.
