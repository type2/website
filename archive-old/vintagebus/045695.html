I lost track of the vintage plate thread.  Were you able to register vintage 
plates for your bus or are they just front bumper show-offs?  I have come 
across a stash of Florida plates (as well as a few other states, Ohio, New 
Hampshire, others) from the 60's and 70's in a nearby antique store.  The 
seller is asking $12 for each plate and I picked one up for my 70 Westy.  
They had a 66 plate but it was for Ohio and I thought that would be silly on 
a Florida bus.  Can they be registered or should I just bolt it to the front? 
 Is anyone out there interested in these plates?  The shop is a block away 
and I would be glad to check for specific dates for anyone.  They are in fair 
shape, straight with minor rust, nicks and scrapes.
