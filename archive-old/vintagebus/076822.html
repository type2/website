Hi Adrian,
If one pulls the fuel sock and drains the tank of any crud it is very 
unlikely that the fuel sock will clog up thereafter for a decade or two.  
  A local great VW repair shop (now long gone) had a VW come in with a 
problem where it would just die and then in a few minutes would start up and run for 
some time before doing the same again.  The problem happened when the gas 
tank was half full or less.  When they pulled out the gas tank it turned out 
there was no fuel sock and a round piece of thin plastic inside.  Turns out the 
plastic was from a bottle of fuel additive that the owner liked to pour into his 
VW on a regular basis.  When doing this the owner would not pull off the 
inner seal off the bottle all the way and thusly one of these times it dropped off 
when pouring.  This would float around in the tank and get sucked down onto 
the fuel outlet tube.
  It takes alot of crud to block the fuel sock and only takes one piece to 
clog the outlet tube!
