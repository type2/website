Aren't these the same pieces found in kombis, trucks, and panels?
I believe WW sells these as repop. Not sure what the pricing is.
I know a guy who has these NOS.
I think they were VW brazil, same specs, but the pattern/grain in the 
panelboard is a bit different.
50$ a pair plus postage if anyones interested.

&lt;&lt;Has anyone recently replaced or removed the panel over the driver and

passenger area?  I started on the Panel today and would bet these will be

the hardest to duplicate.  Anyone have a pattern they's sell me or willing

to make me a pattern?  I figure the back area shouldn't be to hard just keep

guessing with scrap pieces.  However I'd be willing to buy a pattern of

those to.
