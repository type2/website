&gt; A neighbor stopped by with his new toy. A radio controlled moster truck. 
&gt; Okay, cool and fun but I was taken back to the VW show where I saw a radio 
&gt; controlled &quot;splitty&quot;. Does anyone know where I can find one of these bodies? 
&gt; I remember the guy at the show telling me he had the bus body/shell special 
&gt; ordered and it went over the chasis of one of these monster trucks. Need to 
&gt; get one ordered for my son just in time for the holidays. So what if hes only 
&gt; 2yrs old. Never to young to start playing with VW toys! ;) Daddy first!!!!
