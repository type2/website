hey now,
i know i posted this once, but that other place didnt even know when they 
would get them in. these are made by Catz, and the packaging is in english. 
importing the others from japan was probably hard for the other company. 
anyway, i searched for a dealer on this website and found one a mile or so 
from where i work!! i called him and he sold the last one, so ill go and pay 
for them and he will get them &quot;in a day or two.&quot; i think they will be great 
for our buses... i know the whole amp draw thing but, cant flash any faster 
than if you had a bulb burned out. and thats not that bad. $50 for a pair.
