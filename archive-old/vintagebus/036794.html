 Does anyone have a list of what options were available for barndoor busses.  
 I've been told that M-codes didn't exist at that time, but I know that 
 options must have been available.  My '52 Standard has a drivers side sun 
 visor which I haven't seen on many standard barndoors as well as rear corner 
 body bumpers.
  &gt;&gt;

yes they had M codes, but they did not have their m codes stamped on a tag 
and attached to the bus.  You can get the info from the auto musueum 
stifling.  My 53 standard came with 3 M codes, according to their records
