Anyone with one of these 6V AM/FM radios help me 
figure out a couple of things?

- there are five wires coming out of the 
chassis.  Two brown ones are paired and must be 
the speaker wires.  One wire has a fuse - that's 
6V+ in.  One is plain black, that's ground.  One 
is long and yellow/brown and has a funny tang on 
the faston connector at the end -- that's 
dashlights, right?

- are there separate bass and treble controls on 
the outer knob rings?  They both seem to move 
rheostats.  It ain't balance &amp; fader. :-)

- will this thing power a 14&quot; subwoofer mounted 
in the rear luggage compartment and a pair of 
Bose 301's mounted on the hood?  Didn't think so 
either.

Right now mine does nothing, except the dial 
lights when either the fused or the yellow/brown 
wire has juice and the switch is on. ?  Both 
conditions require grounding the black wire.  
Chassis ground seems to do nothing.

Am considering sending it to Walter Odemer for 
an estimate.  Feedback gratefully accepted!

In other news, got the junkyard Ghia clock 
working, and after 24 hours it only lost 1 
minute!  It had to have been in that junkyard 5-
10 years from the shape of the car (a '66).  
Amazing.
