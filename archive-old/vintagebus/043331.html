Subject: New to the list, '64 Standard questions
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10007092244420.15397-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

I'm new to the list.  I just bought a '64 Standard Microbus from
about the 3rd owner.  It's blue-white and turquoise (L 289, L 380).
It has a 1500 engine from a '68 Bug.  Six pop-out windows, missing
the middle seat.  The worst rust is the rocker panel under the
side doors (a few holes, biggest one 1/4&quot; or so) and the next worst
is around the roof gutter on the passenger side (haven't found
any holes...yet...)  It's still 6 volt.  I've figured out all the
M-codes except &quot;426&quot; (seems to be some guesses that this is a 
US-equipment code) and which port &quot;F&quot; was.  This Bus was built on 
15 November 1963.  Rummaging around revealed a California
personalized plate under the spare tire, &quot;EDCVOSS&quot;, stamped,
yellow letters on blue ground, no year stickers.  The Bus and I 
currently live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but I'm originally from
Independence, Missouri.

Anyway...I have a few questions.  I'm not completely new to VWs...
I have wrenched on my Dad's '74 standard Bug and a kit car that
was based on a late-60s Beetle.  I have Muir and I plan to get
Bentley's; I know about the archives and library at type2_dot_com -
feel free to tell me to &quot;go read the article.&quot;  :)

The first thing I have to replace is the fuel lines (one of the
rubber ones leaks under pressure).  Right now all the fuel line
is rubber with the braided covering, but I'm wondering if I'm
missing some of the metal line.  It has braided hose from the
tank outlet, through the little clip on the bottom of the floor
above the tranny, and through the front engine tin.  Right
around #4 cylinder it is clamped on to a metal line, which
runs around almost to the fuel pump, with a short &quot;jumper&quot;
to the pump inlet.  Should that metal line run on around and
through the tin (with a grommet)?  Seems like the rubber line
could get cut up on the tin.  I do plan to put NEW stainless
worm-gear clamps on all the connections.

Does anyone know the specs on a Bosch &quot;031&quot; distributor?  The
full number is 0 231 129 031.  I'm trying to figure out if
this is something close to &quot;right&quot; for this engine or if I
need to change it out.

The PO claimed that the odometer was reset to zero when the
new engine was installed.  If that's true, the engine has
around 57k miles.  But I'd also think this would run afoul
of the various odometer laws.  Anyone ever heard of this
before? 

I took the headlight buckets out tonight and discovered
something interesting.  The stock VW yellow/white/brown
wires are spliced (with non-VW-looking splices) to a
standard 3-lug sealed-beam connector.  The connector wires
seem to have a fabric covering.  The owner's manual I got
with the Bus (in English, Aug. '63 edition) shows the
old-style separate bulb and reflector setup.  Is it
possible that this was converted to sealed-beams sometime
later in life, or...?

I know, I know, lots of questions.  I hope to be able to
help with answers to other people's questions, at least
for the stuff I think I know.  :)

Thanks!
