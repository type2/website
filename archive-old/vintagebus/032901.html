Subject: my 10 foot vw sign 2nd try
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I loaded the pic of me and my 10 foot vw dealer sign. i hate aol as im sure 
many of you do but i dont pay for it so i cant complain.
its on  www.vintagebus_dot_com    go to the pic gallery index    and it is under 
acessories

 well i got this sign from a friend who works at a ford dealership   which 
bought out a vw dealership a few years ago. its been sitting in the back lot 
where the other one was driven over and is now in a couple pieces.
well tell me what ya think.
