Subject: got seats for sale!

I got a really really nice middle seat out of a 64 kombi today for my friend.
But he changed his mind, he wants a camper interior! stupid fool! well
anyways, i just want my money that i paid for it back. 300 dollars put it to a
good home. It's a full length middle seat with orginal covering, not even a
tear anywhere on the covering! It sat in a barn for who knows how long, before
that was used in a church bus(64 kombi) I'm gonna clean it up tommorrow and
get some pics on the net.
Ohh yeah, i got a back seat out of a 67 deluxe i'd sell for 250. It's in good
shape. Ohh yeah my prices are neg. unless your a part flipper, then they
double!
peace
john
