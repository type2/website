Hey there--
I definately no clutch guru, but, I had a similar problem in my B*g. It ended 
up that the engine leaked oil onto the clutch through the main seal and the 
clutch was slipping. Be careful  on overrevving because if this is the prob, 
the clutch can easily &quot;burn out&quot;.
I think this is one possibility? (am I crazy?)  :)
