LOL....

&gt;Swap, Show, Drag Racing (dressing up in women's clothes and driving real
&gt;fast has never appealed to me)

I know...you'd think San Francisco would have built their own dragstrip by
now!

&gt;All proceeds go to benefit the Bob Hole Fund for Disadvantaged Cal Look
&gt;Kiddies and New Beetle Wannabes!

Pffft....laugh!  Heheh  :)

&gt;I'll be there with both buses!

I'll be there in the '63 Camper with Strictly Vintage 2s banner parked in
the participant show area...I'll have a small box there too with flyers for
the Silicon Valley Chapter and membership forms for the club, please feel
free to take one of each!  If I'm there at the camper, please say hi and
introduce yourself...I'll be the chubby blonde kid with the SV2s shirt on.

Let's just hope it cools off before then...gyah!
