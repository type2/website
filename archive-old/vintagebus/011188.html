--part1_168.819a54.28cad8d1_boundary

1.all vw's must be parked next to other vw's so they can &quot;chat&quot;
2.all beater busses must be reasured nightly that they ARE loved and WILL be 
restored
3.when a non vw person asks you (a self respecting vw person) how you like 
their new honda, you must reply &quot;the engines in the wrong place&quot;
4.hug your bus, love your bus, be ONE with the bus.
