From a source at VWoA there has been talk of a Vintage Parts Program,
Porsche did this years ago with the purchase of Stoddard Imports, this gave
them a retail outlet for Porsche parts, they went to vendors and
manufacturers of these parts, gave them the option of selling there product,
through Stoddard, with a original Porsche Vintage part no#, if they agreed
to these terms, they would no longer be able to market there product except
through Stoddard! I have heard that VWoA was trying to start the same
program, Authorized VW Vintage Parts, but the vendors didn't want in the
program due to selling constraints, they can sell more through the VW rags
then VWoA could and the prices would increase drastically due to the profit
margins that VWoA needs, which would increase the prices to consumers.
There are a couple of companies that are now importing all original VW parts
from the factory in Mexico, but most of these are hard parts for the Type 1
beetle.I have been trying to get one of my suppliers to import the new Swing
trannys and also the king and link disc brake front ends (for buses) that
are produced in Brazil but to no avail due to cost of product and consumer
demand. So as of now, I feel the VwoA Vintage program is on hold and the
dealers aren't allowed to sell non authorized Vw parts, so good luck on the
NOS dealer parts stuff, I did find some good stuff in GERMANY at the dealers
and even at a VW repair shop, (like NOS cab divider glass).

this is just my opinion and based on what I have heard (whether true or not)
and what I have seen.

Folks, we're talking two different organizations here.  There's VW,
and there are the dealers.  They each have somewhat different
incentives - VW wants to take over the automotive world (witness all
their acquisitions; it's a required trait of large companies,
really).  The dealer wants to sell new cars, because that's what he
makes commission on.

The result of the above differing motivations is that VW can want to
encourage the continued existence of their older products as
advertising.  The dealer sees it as a lost sale of a new car.  As long
as the dealers are motivated by selling cars more than by selling
parts, that won't change.  And quite frankly, the mark-up on most
parts, although larger in terms of percentage, is much smaller in
absolute value than on an entire vehicle.
