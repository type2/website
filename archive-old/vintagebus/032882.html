I think I know what you are talking about.  There is a Police device that I
believe operates on this principle.  It is a little projectile cart with an
antenna that can be launched on the ground from a moving patrol car.  The
antenna contacts anything metal on the chassis, etc., and wreaks its own
debilitating havoc.  Probably a prototype, but I saw it in action on TV... I
think they said something about it not affecting cars without computer chips.
I would assume we bussers would escape on that technicality, but can we really
get away from that V-whatever powered gass-guzzling monster they are chasing
us down with?  And do we really need to?
