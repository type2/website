The only problem with Ms. Joplins Porsche was that it was sold and the new
owner repainted it, then it was sold again and painted back to the way she
had it, so is it art or just a copy of original work?

&lt;&lt;PS  This doesn't mean that I'm going to paint over the graphics (some
of the
responses didn't want to qualify it as art) on my Grateful Dead bus= = =
= = &gt;&gt;

Trust me, Jp. If you paint over the graphics on the Grateful Dead bus,
no one will ever bring you to court for it. And if they do, they won't
win. And really, that is exactly what you should do. Paint over it. If
you're gonna do the hippie paint thing or the Greatful Dead paint thing
(why?), then at least do it right. Take a look at Janis Joplins porche.
Now there was a paint job. Anybody that paints over that will find
themselves in deep dooooodoooo. Didn't she also own a bus?? Anybody know
where it is?
