Importance: Normal

Using metal with Zeus fittings will provide some structural
support.  Individual pieces simplifies the parts.  The Zeus
fittings (spelling is questionable) is a flush fit 90 degree
attachment similar to T3, loaf, and Vanagon engine hatch
covers.  Some have a D-ring.  I would think that anything
other than metal would compromise rigidity.  There are
other types and designs of captive fasteners available
also.  Including some designs that can be done on the cheap
if you have a lathe or drill press to cut down screws with.

Jeff   bussless but helped design some captive fasteners for
a military application 20 years ago.

List, two questions:
1. Do you think a removable cargo floor is possible?
2. If you do, any suggestions for materials?
