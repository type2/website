Subject: [VB] NEED: Low hinge panels doors
Message-ID: &lt;0.4b1b8ca7.25955cf5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Please help!

I just bought a '67 double door panel.  All four doors have rust at the 
bottom and two of them have (sundial?) windows cut into them.  I'm looking 
for two pairs of straight &amp; solid panel doors to replace them with.  Among 
other things I have stock pop out window doors in good shape to trade as well 
as good old reliable cash.

Please help me out if you can.

Thanks,
Dan

PS:  I'm just outside of Kansas City.  Will pay shipping from anywhere.
