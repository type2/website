Hi James,
If it is a knocking sound and not a chuffing sound that really acts up when 
you accelerate then you have a rod bearing going bad.  Any engine that sat 
for 14 years without proper preperation for the storage and any TLC while in 
storage is more than likely a real mess inside due to corrosion from both 
water and combustion remains in there.
