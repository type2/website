Rachel brings up a good point about the DMV.  I've found my local DMV is
staffed with the most ignorant people you could imagine.  All they know are
the common rules they deal with everyday such as paying for new tags on your
2001 Pickup Truck, how to renew old tags, etc.  When it comes to turning in
plates off of old cars for a refund (which they do here in Nebraska) or
swapping Ham Radio callsign plates from one vehicle to another, they totally
lose it and give you their defacto &quot;we can't do that&quot; statement.  Usually,
my efforts in trying to reason with them fail, and I have to come home, call
the state DMV, and then tell them how much time the local outfit has cost
me.  I usually say (polite but firm), &quot;Well since they've managed to waste 3
hours of my time, would you please call them up and tell them what the law
is?  I want to be in and out of there in 20 minutes.&quot;  So far they've done
it.  When I show up, I get to cut ahead of everyone in line and my request
is expedited.

For instance, one time I had ham radio call sign plates on my parents car
which they let me use.  At the time, Nebraska law stated you only had to
request a callsign plate and you could get it.  Well over time, I got my own
vehicle and wanted the plates transferred.  Law had changed by this time and
the owner of the car had to be the ham radio operator.  They told me to go
spend another $12.50 at the titling office to title MY vehicle in my
parent's name so I could get the ham plates.  I countered with, &quot;Well why
can't I surrender my ham radio plates and get my refund?  Next I'll get
standard plates for my parent's car, then re-apply for my ham radio plates
in my name for my vehicle?&quot;  &quot;Sir you cannot do that because the ham radio
plates are in your father's name.&quot;

&quot;But I'm the Ham Radio operator.&quot;
&quot;Well I'm sorry but blah blah blah.&quot;

This was after several days of wrangling with them on another issue which
resulted in a call to the state DMV.  Those state boys know their stuff but
the little podunk towns with their fossilized, narrow-minded, scare
mongering techniqued staff are for the birds.

Now when I go into the local DMV, I get hateful looks/ignored, so I just
have to assert myself now when in line.  Sometimes you just gotta do what
you gotta do.  The main thing is that as long as you take the time to
actually read up and find out what the actual law is, there's NOTHING like
having that knowledge memorized(and having hardcopy with you) to really make
your case stand out.  When you can argue the actual law as it currently
reads, you really stir up the old hornet's nest and you can protest with all
kinds of confidence because you know without a doubt that you are 100% right
and THEY have it wrong.

They hate that! (And I love it!)
