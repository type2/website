The topic says it all.  I am about to give up on this carb.  A 34PICT3 on a
1600dp w/009 that checks out O.K. but just won't idle.  I've tried
everything I can think of ( I'm NOT a carb specialist) and have had no luck.
The engine fires right up and will rev up great but the second I let off the
gas, it dies.  I have checked the idle cut off and it is O.K. I even tried
one from another carb that is running fine on my baja, still no idle.
So........

HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jon
