&lt;&lt; Hey all,
     Can someone please tell me if high hinge cargo doors all came with hinge
 covers?
 Or did only the front door come with covers ? or if this was an option ?
  &gt;&gt;

not all high hinge buses came with hinge wedges/covers, but those that came 
with wedges had wedges by all the hinges.  the later high hinge door buses 
had them, I think just late 60 through early 61.   if one of you doors had 
been replaced with a earlier high hinge door, then the early door hinge 
wouldn't have the hole for the wedge to be scewed to.
