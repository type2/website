&gt; AFAIK 
&gt; Brake fading is caused by the fluid boiling the effect being the 
&gt; same as
&gt; having air in the lines. I dont think the drums could expand enough 
&gt; to
&gt; make any difference.

Aaah, if you air brakes fade then what.
is it the same effect as having fluid in your lines?
and if your cable brakes fade then
 that's the same as having springs in your cables?

My vote on all this engine braking is 
error on the side of safety not let my brakes fade
 (no mater how it happens) 
engine parts are easy to get 
Bus brake parts will be harder to find
as there are more type1s than type2s

flame shields up.
