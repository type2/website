Before I got a auto body supply store to mix up a batch of real L87, I
had some success using a 5oz. rattle can of Dupli-Color 'Creme' from a
FLAPS to repaint the battery area on my DC and touch up some spots on
the backseat floor.  Doing a highly visible outer body scratch with this
might be a different matter, however.  Also, try your local Sherwin
Williams paint store.  They have 12oz. rattle cans of 3 or 4 spray
enamel colors approaching L87, for example, 'Antique White'.

BTW some auto body supply stores will mix up real L87 and put it in
rattle cans for you.  Inquire locally, as they say...

&gt; Does anyone know of a reasonable match to L87 Pearl White that is
&gt; available in a rattle can?  Something in an over the counter spray from
&gt; a FLAP that I can use for a quickie touch up.  Likewise for L82 Silver
&gt; White.
