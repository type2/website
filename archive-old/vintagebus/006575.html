Actually, quite a few of these made it into the States.

They're based on Renault Dauphine running gear, with the Dauphine's rear
engine and transaxle swapped end-for-end and modified to accommodate wheels
that steer.  They have a much lower load carrying capacity than a [OBC]
Kombi/Transporter.  The engine in stock trim only cranked out around 32HP,
and that was with the stem wound pretty tightly.

If you think [OBC] parts for an early splitty are tough to find, don't even
think about one of these rigs.

FWIW
