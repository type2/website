You need to check the settings in your email client.

While some email messages may have mime-encapsulation which
can encode font type, color and size, this doesn't propogate across
messages, and most list servers either reject messages
with such encapsulation (because it's absolutely freakin'
useless and a waste of bandwidth) or strip the encapsulation
before propgating the message.  The vintagebus and type2 list 
s/w flatly rejects such messages.

In addition, such messages regarding local-issues, ie &quot;why can't
I send, why can't I receive why did my computer spontaneous burst
into flame&quot; should be either sent to the list administrator, or
to your local PC support guru.

&gt; 18 points! (was 9 points) Anyone out there know why? What can I do to fix
&gt; it?
