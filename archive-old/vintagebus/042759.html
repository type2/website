Subject: westy header bows, size?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0010311200390.82458-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hello all,

I would like to make some of those wood things in a westy that you screw
the overhead wood to... but i dont have the dimesnions... (putting a
headliner in my 61)

does anyone know their size? i have a pattern i can use for the curvature,
but i need to know how thick they are from roof to where the wood screws
on and how wide of wood i need.

thanks,

Steve
