Subject: rebuilt longblock advice needed

My longblock from Quality German Auto arrived and I'm ready to put the stuff
from my kaput motor on it but I have some questions. Is there a way for me
to clean my oil cooler (dog house generic type)because I want to do this
right the first time.  I've purchased new engine hardware nuts and stuff and
some engine tin. I guess I'll keep the generator(12v) as is however I did
buy new brushes and the fuel pump and carb and all worked fine before so
should I leave well enough alone and just put it all on the new 1776
longblock. I would appreciate any advice from those who have BTDT. This is
for my '65 camperized standard bus. Thank you.
