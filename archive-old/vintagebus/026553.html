Subject: [VB] sidecover glue/sealant?
Message-id: &lt;385feb9e.7055.0_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hey gang,

My sideplates have begun to drip.  Let me know if this is the procedure.  I
figure I'll unbolt the sideplate, wipe everything down, change the gasket, reapply
sealant and bolt it back up.  Question is, what kind of &quot;glue&quot; should I use?
 Someone said 3M but 3M what?  TIA
