&gt; Steve - you're absolutely right!  Being familiar with splitties and only now
&gt; learning about bays and all.  Holy guano!  He ABSOLUTELY DOES need support for
&gt; the tranny with the engine out.

Just a FYI to all towers out there...  up to 67 the tranny is supported...
bolted to big beefy horn things.

68-71 the tranny is unsupported at the rear and either needs to be chained
to the chassis or removed when the bus is engineless.

72-79 the tranny is supported by a mount that goes from the bellhousing to
the chassis... not quite as sturdy as a split, but definitely strong
enough to handle any ammount of engineless towing you could throw at it.
(i know many people that have thrown a 1600 in one of these vans using the
tranny support to hold the engine and tranny up... it seems to work pretty
well.  I wouldnt do it but this might give you some idea how sturdy this
mount is.)

80- end of v'gon production. the tranny is unsupported at the rear again
and will need to be chained to the chassis or removed when the bus is
engineless.

there, now you have the complete scoop.

peas,

Steve
