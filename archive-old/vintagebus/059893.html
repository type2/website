Subject: MIg  Verses arc. 

It really don't make a a rats ass dude if you have a mig use it if not use
the arc. your not shooting for strength anyway your just holding them
together. I used the mig on my thing when i removed the plates from it
,,later  Oh they might have specified arc because mig wasn't around at the
time it was printed, and Gas welding them probably wouldn't be good. later
