If anyone is interested in a '65 DC that has a running
engine and in about the same shape let me know. 
Except it has seats (beautiful rear seat) and deluxe
bumpers and stuff.  The bed looks a little better too.
 Comes with other parts too.  Located in Lincoln, NE. 
No time this summer for it, which is a shame.  New job
relocating me for the summer.  I don't have to get rid
of it, but will let him go to good home for right
price.

&gt; If it was closer to home, I'd consider about it... 
&gt; I think this is a very
&gt; doable project.  Buy this bus and bring it back to
&gt; life will get you a &quot;Thom
