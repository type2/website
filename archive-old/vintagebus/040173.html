Subject: Re: Euro Tails on U.S. Bus?

ha.... i did this EXACT thing when i couldnt get mine to work when my 
&quot;little black box&quot; went ca-put. for the brakes you should have a brake light 
switch with two prongs... just wire power to one and the other to the 
lights. and the running lights should be easy. the signals, since the're a 
separate bulb, could be wired directly with a couple $.99 flasher relays. 
you just need to get the wiring diagrams to see what color the wires coming 
from your switch are.
