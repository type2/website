Subject: Forecast for upcoming BNNTA...

Hi all,

The weather forecast sounds exceptional for this upcoming Labor Day holid=
ay
weekend and for &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #17&quot;.  After the high temps=

high 90's that we had last year, they're now calling for a nice cooling
trend for the upcoming campout weekend, with supposed daytime high's in t=
he
mid 80's (and probably in the back of a few vans too), and evening lows i=
n
the lower 70's.  If that holds up, it should be awesome lakeside camping
weather.  So you might want to throw a sweatshirt and jeans into the Bus
too.

We're looking forward to seeing everybody again around the campfire!  I
should be unlocking the campground gates at noon on Friday for the
early-birds.  Could someone on the Vanagon List forward this message to
that List for me, thanks!
