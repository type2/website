I've had a lot of interest in my CB 044 heads that will be coming up for
sale.  Everyone wants to know which ones they are.  These are the 044
Supermags - CB# 1453 cut for 90.5 P/C's.  As I recall, it was about the most
expensive head I could buy from them with the largest valves possible.  I've
been running lash caps but have removed the 2nd spring.  I can include them
with who ever ends up with these heads.

What I would love to be able to do is to exchange them straight across for a
NEW set of stock heads with a 3 angle valve job or at least sell them for
enough money to get a set of the aforementioned heads.

I don't even have the engine out of the bus yet.  This is all stuff I
started thinking about within the past 24 hours so I need time to get things
going.
