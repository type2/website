&gt; hey,
&gt; i called to inquire and order some of these magic products and after talking 
&gt; to the operator am more confused than ever. i removed the front windows and 
&gt; discovered it was pretty crusty and pitted under there. found two or three 
&gt; tiny holes on the bottom. i was thinking of using some of the POR15 putty 
&gt; stuff to fill in the pits and holes and then top it with the black stuff. 
&gt; anyone ever use their putty? suggestions please.
I bought some but have yet to use it...

i would suggest, however putting on the POR15 first, and then the putty.
The putty isnt a rust inhibitor and if you put it on first the metal will
continute to rust between teh putty and the good metal.

peas,

Steve
