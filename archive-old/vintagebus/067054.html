Subject: Last shameless plug for Oktoberbus

Y'all have heard me extoll the virtues of that most wondrous of campouts, 
Oktoberbus.  I've typed and typed untill my poor fingers were worn down to 
nubs and nowq i hev dflikutly tieping brecuz um knot uzeddd too tiprign with 
nubs.

Anyhow, It's this coming weekend, a URL to help you find your way is at the 
end of this e-mail, and we look forward to seeing all of you there.  If you 
all came, Casey would be very happy but I don;t know if we'll have enough 
door prizes or burrito fixin's for all of you so why dont just those that can 
make it, do and we'll see the rest of y'all next year.

Door prizes and burrito fixin donations are most welcome, don;t forget the 
decorate your bus/site in it's best Hallowe'en garb, and trick or treating 
after the ritual case burn.
