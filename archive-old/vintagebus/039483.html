Hey All,

I just got a 67 turn signal switch and harness over the weekend and had a 
question.  2 wires come off right after the start of the shrink wrap that 
could only go to a switch/knob on the dash.  One is brown (ground?) and one 
is blue.  A friend w/ a bently though it patched into a wire going form 
light switch to hazzard or wiper.  I've tryed various connections and can't 
get my high beams to stay on.  I had this same prob w/ my 66 switch but the 
same 2 mystery wires were not connected as well.  I do have one hot wire 
that is unconnected that seems to patch in to a wire going to both the light 
switch and hazard switch.  Also my turn signal switch won't stay tight on 
the steering tube/column with the 2 screws and it will not turn off when the 
wheel goes straight.  It is in the same location as my other switch that 
turned off fine.  Is there a diff w/ the 12v 67 and 6v 66 turnsignal switch, 
both have the exact harness and part numbers.

Thanks,

Eric
