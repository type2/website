Subject: bad luck message from last Thurs. (slightly updated)
Mime-Version: 1.0

I originally tried to send this message last Thurs. evening when the list
was down and thought I'd go ahead and send it again.

----------------

Today (actually last Thursday when the list went down)I &quot;played hookie&quot;
from work. I did something I never do and called in sick. Since I havn't
worked on my '59 Kombi in a few weeks, I needed a good long day.

I started out with the plan to sandblast all of my different window frames.
after I got a couple of 1/2's done, my craftsman compressor bit the dust!
Something got out of wack causing the rod to miss where it needed to go,
destroying the fan, rod, and a few other metal parts in the area. Local
Sears parts center doesn't have any of in stock, so after a 1-800 phone
call the replacement parts should be here Sat (turned out they arrived
sometime Friday!!! Cool!!!). I did a few other things, then decided to pick
up some window tint and try to tackle that job.

So far I've done 2 pop-outs and I give myself a &quot;B&quot; on both. Maybe I'm
being too picky. I'll let you know how they all come out in the end. Could
be I should have taken the glass somewhere and paid $110 more than I did to
have someone else do it. Then again, maybe they'll be OK in the end. That's
the bad thing about doing stuff yourself....you get REAL picky about
things. I mean, I never noticed those tiny little chips in the glass
before. Now that I know they're there, that's all I can see.(finished all 6
pop-outs and still give myself a b+ on the whole thing).

So I'm a little disappointed that my &quot;free day&quot; was wasted. Just seem to be
having bad luck with free time over the last month. Seems like I'll never
get this thing finished. You single guys without any wife or kids should
REALLY take advantage of your situation while you've got it (Thom's a good
example of the way to do it!). It's a no brainer that your family is
priority, it's just a little hard sometimes. Can't wait til my kids are old
enough to help me out!

p.s. I work on my bus at a shop a few miles down the road. It's a &quot;loaner&quot;
and the owner had the garage door replaced. They said the bus was plenty
out of the way and not to worry about it. Now my new paint job has a 1/2
down to the metal scratch on the top side rear corner. Damn!! at least it's
in the white. I'll just suck it up and touch up the paint with a brush. I
guess it won't be the first...but I havn't even driven the bus yet! I'm
SOOO ready to be finished.
