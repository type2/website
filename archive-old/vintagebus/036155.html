OK folks, I found a bus today that I have never seen before.  The bus
was a 1965 Kombi  bench seat with a factory installed sunroof!
Looking up at the roof of the bus from the inside(no headliner) you
could see the 8 skylight window frames as well as the sunroof frame. 
The skylights were not cut into the roof, but all the frame structure is
there.The sunroof looks and works like looks like a deluxe.  From the
outside it just looks like a plain old kombi but it has a sunroof minus
the skylights.  BTW the bus also has a belly pan and was painted blue
white/velvet green originally and only has 2 pop outs.

I quickly jotted down some numbers from the M-plate.

1 7
430 025 056 180
2252381783
5174370

I appoligize if some of the #'s don't match up.  From what I could get
from my few books, its an early 65 made on July 1 1965.  #430 = North
American export; 025= safety belts; 056= steering/ignition lock; 180=
without middle bank of seats; 225= Microbus?/loading doors on right,
sunroof (LHD); 2=?; 38= Velvet Green; 17= Blue White; 83= Mesh Gray
interior; 5=1965; 174370=chassis #??

What a combo!  A kombi with two tone paint and a sunroof, but with out a
middle seat.  Could this be right.  How rare?  Value?  No rust in pans
or rockers...some in front floors.  It needs a complete resto.  Good
mechanicals though.   Primered.

sounds just like a friend of mines, except his is a walkthrough (model 285).

yours is 225, standard microbus  double door left, sliding roof, LHD

A regular micro is 221.

FWIW, a kombi is a panel van w/windows- commercial.  Hardboard panels in
front, no panels in back, just primer. no headliner.   Heat all goes to the
cab.  type 23

A microbus is a passenger car- it comes with two tone interior panels front
and back, two tone paint, a headliner, and heat in the heat and front.   type
22

fairly rare- Sounds like yours was sold in germany- I didn't see a port code.
For someone taking it back maybe, if it has the US specs.   seen that .   Got
one.   Same colour, but a camper.      Sounds like a great bus if it's got
that little rust.   Yes, they use the same inside skin on the sunroof micros
as on the sunroof deluxes.  And the same subfloors.   

  Think I've seen half a dozen or so of  sunroof non deluxes.   A couple
turquoise/white 64-  sliding sunroof, sliding side door, locking steering, and
all that green stuff I like, one in a junkyard with parts cut off it, one in a
parking lot of a vw show, but they were twins.  

another earlier one, with all kinds of extras factory stock, a 59-61
thatgreeny/grey colors with original brown/white interior and correct middle
seat for RHD which it was, safaris, st lock, cigar lighter

Zach 65 type 285, sold in Seattle  no other special bits.    Original paint
v.green/blue white.   NW rust.  Runs, has a 40hp motor right now.

a couple others, another 65 (blue/white, not running, rusty), and something
else.   

not a lot.  Probably more in Europe.
