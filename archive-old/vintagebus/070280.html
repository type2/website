Subject: Case 4141

As I told ronnie,

I will gladly send you samples of the sand and also I will have full detailed
pics up on the website soon. I just got the block out of the shop from having
it oversized to 90.5 and full flowed. Like I mentioned in past e-mails, the CW
crank was very tight and a 2 thousandth align bore was necessary to straighten
the case main bore out and make the bearings fit. Once everything rotated OK
he called me up to pick it up to do my die grinding work. With the case open I
saw even more bad casting flash areas and many pics will be posted. Block 4141
will be a good block when I am done. After the work I have to do it's back to
the shop for a full flushing.
