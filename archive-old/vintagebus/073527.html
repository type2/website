Hi Tracey,
You are just going to have to take the entire system apart, clean, inspect 
and replace what has gone bad.  All brake cylinders will have to be taken apart 
and polished with 400 grit wet/dry sand paper and checked for corrosion in the 
bore areas that the piston seals ride in.  The only parts we can say for sure 
are shot will be the four flexable brake lines.  If you do have enough $$$ 
you would do well to buy at least one of each slave cylinder and a MC for your 
bus.  Do check the type2 library for the article to install a 1971 and later 
dual circuit MC so you have alot less chance of having the brakes fail 
completely!

  Inspect the suspension by repacking the front wheel bearings and grease gun 
the front suspension zerk fittings till new grease squeezes out (Repeat every 
3,000 miles.), the link pins.  We do find it best to just take the link pins 
apart to inspect and clean out completely, otherwise some plug up on one side 
and does not allow new grease into that side!  Check rear drums for wiggle 
with E-brake off and at least  change gear oil in the tranny and install new axle 
boots.

  Also inspect the steering for slop due to wear.  After all that then work 
on the engine!
