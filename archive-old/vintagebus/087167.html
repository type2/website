Subject: What ever happened to the bus boat?

The boat you are talking about was sold with the 23 window bus about 15 
years ago. Haven't heard about that one since.
I have owned a bus boat for about 13 years now.
I have been looking for someone who can help me reproduce them but 
haven't found anyone yet.
Is there anyone out there who can help me?
Gary
