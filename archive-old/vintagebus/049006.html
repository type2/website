Hi everyone,
 Well, my bus status has changed again, I sold my second of three deluxes last
Saturday, to a guy in Newburg Or, so that means I have room in my 1 car garage
for my bicycle collection and my  '61-23 window walk-through.  One problem,
they're in Tucson Aridzona!!!

The reason for this post is that I will be Ryder-trucking and flat bed
trailering my '61 and stuff up to Oregon from Tucson, and I will have extra room
for more stuff in the box of the truck.  Ryder has a lame (to me) policy to not
let  you pull anything with a truck smaller than their 15 footer.   All of my
stuff and the bus on the trailer means I have room for lots of other things. 
I'm not looking for parts for myself, Im just offering the extra room to
listees, because I'd sure hate to waste it.  So, anyone have anything they need
relocated between Tucson  - L.A. - Portland (I could pass through San Diego or
Phoenix).  My plan is to leave Tucson on December 2nd and be in Portland on the
evening of the 4th, to report back to work by the 5th.  P-mail me and lets see
if we can work something out.

If no one needs anything moved, then if you see my Ryder truck and a grafittied
23 window deluxe a comin down the road to be with it's daddy finally getting all
my attention - Give a Honk and a Wave!!  This bus has let me own it for a very
long time, and it's due for some TLC.

As Steve Fronczek posted Friday September 18th in 1998 (Subject: Hmm...Ever get
the feeling..) - this is an excerpt from one of my favorite posts:

&quot;.....  Even as you drive, you cant help notice how regal your bus looks when
you see its reflection on shop windows.  It hypnotizes you, paralyzes you into a
silly grin. You feel its pain and it feels yours.  You gently ease it through
turns and you pat it when it does something you thought is wouldn't do.  Busses
are an extension of the driver.  We don't own them, they own us.  A bus lets us
drive them.  We are the replaceable ones...........&quot;


Thanks, (sorry for the ramble)
George of Portland Or.
