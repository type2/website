Factory &quot;re-conditioned&quot; cases as they were called ground out a portion of
the original engine coding and replaced it with another that identified
this re-conditioned case as such.  I don't have the exact lettering the
factory used here, but could get it if someone is really interested.  I
made a post about 2 weeks ago re: this factory procedure.
The numbers under the pushrod tubes were left unchanged, and only the
engine ID letter codes were changed there at the base of the gen. stand.

&gt; Well Eric,
&gt; I don't know what to tell you then.  The numbers under the pushrod tubes are 
&gt; the casting numbers. (see Volksworld December 1999 page 90).  I have heard 
&gt; that factory replacement cases came without serial numbers. Can anyone 
&gt; confirm this?
