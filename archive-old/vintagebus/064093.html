Subject: Re:  [VB] Removed my front beam

From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; That is one area that would be hard to inspect throughly inside for
rusting
&gt; out of the lower section of the shock/beam.  So if there is surface rust
&gt; through out the inside of there we would just replace the beam with a rust
&gt; free one.  Too nasty of results if that crumbled up while doing 100 Km per
&gt; hour!
&gt;  When you reinstall the front beam slather some grease on the beam and
&gt; chassi surfaces that that bolt together to prevent rust from forming in
the
&gt; crack between these.
&gt;

Its quite difficult to actually find a rust free beam at a reasonable price
over here now though unfortunately - I managed to get one cheaply but when
it arrived it was for a pre 60 bus.  Another one I got had a hole in the
bottom and was full of crud.

This hole was only tiny, it had crud against it that I pulled off to reveal
a small hole.  I then poked around and removed all the rusty metal to reveal
a hole this size.  Inside it seems pretty good and there was no evidence of
further rust inside - there was no loose material inside either like the
other rusty beam I had.  I had a good poke round with a poker and I am
having it blasted so that should hopefully show that it is not rusty.  I
will have to keep an eye out on it though.

Paul
