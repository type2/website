Subject: Thanks Ronnie

I just want to thank Ronnie for taking the time to answer a whole bunch of
my questions over the telephone yesterday.  He didn't know me from Adam,
yet he spent 20 minutes talking to me, answering my questions, giving me
advice, scolding my for overpaying on Ebay, and turning me on to this list.

I was about to bid on a Westy tent which sold for $710 on Ebay last night,
but after talking to Ronnie, and visiting a few of the sites he
recommended, I was able to determine that the tent that was being sold
would not be the correct one for my '66.

THANKS RONNIE!
