Subject: And she was...

...driving in her old split bus...  the Talking Heads playing on the Pioneer 
Stereo 8 track Supertuner  yesterday  then head out of town down 101, past 
where the road slid into the inlet when that earthquake happened a few months 
ago, but they did patch it up so there is one lane going out 101, even if it 
is a wierdly banked curve, and the hills have trees, and the sun is shining 
and the wind is blowing in the open passenger side safari (held open a tad by 
a 1x2), and the engine purrs, and the Todd Hill rebuild tranny now has just 
about 3K on it, and shifts fine so far so good, and the left front brake 
stats acting funny (shudder shudder- hm) but I am on my way to Shelton to 
help a guy whos bus does not go.   the Olympic Mountains 
  loom hugely over the road at a few points- alpine majesty with snow on top. 
  It is so nice to see mountains.  Mt Rainier when you are headed E or N- if 
it is clear, and the Olympics in the W/S direction.   everything is lush and 
green, except the dried golden seed heads bent in the breeze.  The Tansy 
Ragwort is starting to flower along the sides of the roads.  I would miss 
trees.  without mountains and tall firs the sky would be so heavy and 
oppressive.  The trees and mountains keep us safe.    The bus purrs up and 
down the hills.  I really love this gearing:  4.37 with bus 4th 1.26 RGBs and 
205 75 R 15 tires on bus 15&quot; rims.   Goes well with a 1600.   Two great 
tastes that taste great together.  Yum.   Even though my bus looks like a POS 
with the 25 YO bondo and paint in patches, and dents in the nose, and 
significant rocker rot, the dash is beautiful SGR, the cab panels are decent 
original, and it sounds good, so from the drivers seat it's wonderful.  Good 
Old Red
