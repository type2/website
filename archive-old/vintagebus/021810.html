Hey, I'm looking to get new tires for my 60 and was wonderig if anyone
had any suggestions.  What would be the ideal size for my bus? I've
looked through the archive on tires and there seems to be alot of info
on 14' but not a whole lot about what I need. Also has anyone ever used
Kumho tires before? In advance thanks, shawn.
