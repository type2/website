&gt;Im having a problem with my motor hope someone can help    around
&gt;town it drives fine but when I get on the freeway at 50  the engine starts
&gt;to cut out and jerk like the nose cone is gone       but that isnt it.
&gt;This only happens when I go up hills and I have lots of gas and a new fuel
&gt;pump.  Could it be caca in the fuel    tank?  Oh the fuel filter is new
&gt;too.     what gives man?     HELP      Thanks  Rick


Sounds like out of gas to me. You say new fuel pump, have you checked that
the rod is the correct one, and that the stroke is adequate? You may need to
shim/unshim the pump. I have read that you can find a nice deserted road, go
tooling along at 50 till it starts to cut out, then simultaneously depress
the clutch pedal and turn off the ignition. Pull safely off to the side,
remove the top of the carb and see if the float bowl is full. Sheesh, sounds
like a PITA to me. I had it happen when I first put the 2275 in the single
cab. Cute little electric fuel pump couldn't keep up. It'd run about an
eighth mile at speed then poop, push in clutch, let bowl refill, then take
off again at a lower speed. Obviously this won't work well for a mechanical
if that is what you have. I put a bigger electric pump in, no problemo.
