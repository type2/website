Subject: Re: [VB] Brake brights

Hi Yall, I just went thru this same thing last week
and it seems the problem with mine was no spacing
between the push rod and the piston as Eric and Barb
suggested. At least it fixed mine.

&gt; Hi Curt,
&gt; It is not a softening of the push rod, it is a
&gt; needed space between the 
&gt; pushrod tip and the piston of the MC that is
&gt; required when the brake pedal is 
&gt; not being pressed on.  Do you have this spacing?
