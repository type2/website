Subject: RE: [VB] stuck drums...

A friend of mine who used to work a Pete Lovely VW in Fife WA used the
same method and it was in their shop repair notes. They used a
non-flammable penatrant and then torched the spline area. They then let
it cool enough to work on and then hit the face of the spline area with
an impact wrench. This rattled the rust bond on the splines and broke it
loose. One more touch with the torch and then the drum puller. Barring a
deep ridge in the drums where the brake shoes could catch, the drums
would come off. The whole spline area, shaft and drum was captive beaded
to remove all rust and carbon greased afterwards.

I've had the same problem with my '62 :

The arm puller I hired at that time didn't help at all.

I ended up heating the sucker until it got bright red and it finally
came out, but the whole braking system inside had suffered.

I would recommend this solution as the very last to be tried out, or in
the case of a complete restauration (ie : brakes cylinders, shoes and
Rboxes)
