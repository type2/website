It's not like the UPS drivers jump up and down on the stuff.  
When you package something, you have to realise that it's going in
with several hundred other boxes, which have to loaded and unloaded
*by hand* very rapidly between the depot and the truck.  Your box
will end up under stuff that is much heavier, with several others on top 
of that, and be handled quite roughly.  Face it, they are not going to
try and handle each package with kid gloves.  These guys have to 
move thousands of boxes in a short amount of time.

Knock on wood, but nothing I've ever shipped UPS has been broken, because
I overstuff it, knowing it's going to have a rough journey.  I think
a lot of shippers just don't give a damn once they have your money.
I got a tonka fire truck set one time that was wrapped in a single layer
of newspaper and set loose in a box!  Another time a 911 H5 headlight
assembly was just set in a box with NOTHING!  You can imagine what it
looked like when I got it...
