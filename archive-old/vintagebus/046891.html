&lt;&lt; No crimp joints at all - now I can see why I'm having some intermittant

Hi NQ,
Best to solder, and heat shrink instead.  The only crimp on connectors that 
seem to last more than just a couple of years is the brass ones from the VW 
factory.  You can buy these same connectors, and the tool to install them, 
but the tool itself costs about $150.00.   Eric&amp;Barb
