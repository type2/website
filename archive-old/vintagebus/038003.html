Hi Ben,
Citric acid is hydrochloric acid!  We have used lemon juice as a cloth 
presoak to take out rust stains!  Also black with red headed ants up here use 
it as a poison against other insects.  If you let one bite you on a finger 
and then lick off the poison from where it bit you it tastes just like lemon 
juice!     Eric&amp;Barb
