Subject: Re: [VB] Bus books

It's called _Blue Highways_, was written around 1982, and is 
this great travel journal of a guy who just takes off one day in his F*rd
va
---------------------- Clip --------------------------
There is another book about a Guy that does the same thing in a Split
Window bus.
I've never found the book but I've been told that the book ends with the
fellow having traveled over 60,000 miles in about three years and his bus
burns in front of a Texas roadside cafe near Lubbock Texas while he's
inside eating.
The cause of the fire was a tumbleweed blowing under his van and igniting
from the exhaust heat.
I'd like to find this book.
I've searched Amazon and a few others under various headings but never
found the book.
