Subject: Westy Tent Clarification

&gt;Oh my Gosh! The Mighty VanBondo pulled a Freshman mistake.
&gt;&lt;red faced but over it&gt;

&gt;This is the kind
&gt;of tent with the grey rubberized floor. It was introduced in 1967 for the 68
&gt;model year. Some 67 splitties were &lt;documented&gt; sold from the dealers with
&gt;this tent but was intended for the 68.

Thank you for clearing this up for me.  I purchased a complete '67 westy at
a sale this past summer.  The bus came from the east coast, but found it's
way to the midwest.  The bus was complete with the rack, awning channel,
gas heater, tent, poles and bags to keep the tent in.  But when I unfolded
the tent, it was the type with the floor.

I talked to a number of westy &quot;experts&quot; who all told me this was the wrong
tent, but I had my doubts because this bus looked too original and complete
(the owners manual and tent booklet were in the tray), has not been
&quot;modified&quot; and had been sitting since the late 70's with fairly low miles.
Before you start to get too excited, it does have it's share of the midwest
rust, but nothing that can't be fixed.

I would though like to have one of the floorless tents with red and white
stripes to match the bus, if anyone would like to do a little trading.

Thanks,
