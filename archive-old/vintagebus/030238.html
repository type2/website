Subject: Restoration update  (65 Samba)

Thing have been a little slow and frusterating latly.  Last report ih
had the motor together but it leaked.  Well,  i took it back apart and
checked it out.

I found that the sealant (gaskasince) did not adhear to the case veery
well.  I also found a small burr on the case that may have keeped it
from seating.  Well.  I tore the thing down, cleaned it up again and
started over.  It steped the leak....well for a week anyway.  It is
back.  Man.  I do not know what is up here.  I checked the case for
straightness and all looked good.  I don't know...   For the time being
i will live with it.  I think i will try another sealant next time.
(although i have alway's had good luck with this stuff).  Other then
that, i am still trying to diagnose the charging system and have yet to
get the motor running real nice.

I did figure out the carb return spring system with a govenor.  I do in
fact have the right manifold for the govinor.  My bus was suposed to
have a 28 pict1 carb with the older push spring cable return.  I have
installed that and it worked great.  I do have to finish the carb
though.  I have a leak at the gas inlet.

On a good note.  I did get ahold of some seat welting for the door
panels and finished them.  Man, the interior looks great.  I would call
it 95% original with what is available today.  (ie, the material color
is not 100% correct but very close)  I also got the rear carpet and
installed that.  I am basically done from the front seat back as far as
interior.  That feals good.

Up in front i have&quot;
1.  Locate one front seat (1/3 half) pivot bolt
2.  Locate the mount brackets for the clock.
3.  Paint the radio plate
4.  Figure out why the turn sig's suddenly do not work.  (Something
happened when i put the front panel in.  Loose wire)
5.  Get some safari glass and finish them.

That is all as far as the interior.  The rest is the motor and a few
hard parts to find.

Thanks for reading.  If you can help with any of the following i would
apreciate it.

Middle seat side panel  (original in any condition)
65-67 safari window pivots  (Izzy's or originals)
Carb to air cleaner cross tube.  (New repop)

So close yet so far.....
Matt
