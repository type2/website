Subject: Re: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

Another couple quick/easy questions:

Spindles are on, everything seems good, very tight....link pins accepted
grease through the nipples readily, but the king pins are so tight that I
can't get any grease to go in....should I worry?

The old center pin is out, bushings are out (thanks to George Lyle and
Michael Pjetraj on the subject at the TypeII_dot_com Library), and the new
bushings are in.  The upper bushing required pressing with the big C-clamp,
but the bottom one went in smoothly by hand.  Not right, I suspect!  Anyway,
I am reaming the bushings, and run into two problems:

1.  The reamer runs into the shift rod before getting all the way through.
Is this normal?  Should I remove the rod?

2.  With the center pin kit, there is a small white rubber O-ring.  Not
mentioned anywhere, and the old assembly did not have one.  Where does it
go?

Thanks a bunch!

P.S.  To avert much pain and anger, remember that there is a locking tab on
the swing lever bolthead!  (Surprise surprise!)
