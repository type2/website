Hi all,
I've been searching for a pair of gas tank dividers for my '57SC.  I was
told there was a change in the design in '65 and another in '68.  Does
anybody know what these changes are.  I've been offered a set from the
'65-'67 era, will they work ?

Thanks,
John

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
