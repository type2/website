Subject: the Scoop on Scoops...

Way to go Clara. I have often thought it should be fairly easy to test
this. Weird thing is Gene Berg supposedly did some testing and said that
they made the engine run hotter. I don't remember for sure but I think I
remember reading that. I don't see how. Someone mentioned trying to keep
the aircooled engines cool sitting in traffic. I have run some big
(2110) and not necessarily well tuned motors and never had them run warm
at idle. My 2110 would run nice and cool all day long, until you went
over 55 and then it would continually creap up over 260 degrees of oil
temp. When you would slow to 50 it would drop quickly back down to
around 190 to 200. I tried the electric fan thing (not scientifically)
and I have not been able to find one that can push all that much air
using only the availabe 12 volts to run it.

Thanks for the empirical data,
Craig
