Jamie,

I can only speak for myself here, but I ask the reserve the person has on it
to see if the number I have as max to spend on the item is in the ballpark of
what the reserve is.  I don't know why you wouldn't want to disclose the
reserve in your description.  If you are serious about selling an Item your
reserve will reflect that and people can decide how bad they want the item.
If you are a retard and up to some childish scheme, than your reserve will
reflect that also.  In many cases, the reserve price is way out of wack and
the person never discloses the price because they want people to bid, contact
the person with highest bid and sell to them directly, without paying the
ebay commision.

good luck.
Aaron

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; I'm listing an bus item on E-bay and have set a reserve.  I keep getting
&gt; messages from perspective bidders asking my reserve.  Is this common
&gt; practice?  Should I disclose this information.  After the $3000 middle
&gt; seat episode, I'm wearing my flame retarding suit ;0)
