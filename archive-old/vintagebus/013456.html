OH KAY

I gotta ask all you friendly and knowledgeable list members dis here
question. I was given a set of correct 15&quot; rims for my semi-stock (1600
s/p pict 30 muffler and redux gears) '61 kombi and they have the most
monster tires I've ever seen on a vw rim 7.00x15 recaps (I ran them on my
'46 Ch**y 1/2 and on farm implements and tractors in the past they are
really tough but I've never had them above 55 MPH on said vehicles ( 35
on the tractor all you smart guys !-))) dare I run them? I've seen this
size with off road tread advertised in one of the hot bikini er ah vw
rags as &quot;NEW&quot; ,what's that all about? In my younger days I levered a set
on to some rims by hand, No more! they are EXTREMELY stiff and I doubt i
could even pop the bead nowadays. I'll stick to the 135 15s on my bug :)

thanks ah?
Ken
