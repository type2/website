When it rains, the humidity down in the south rises, causing the
metal to swell, distorting both the door and the door frame.  Try
filling the door cavity and door frame cavity with silica gel
to absorb the excess moisture.

Failing that, check the adjustment both on the window frame (it
can be loosened and tilted slightly) and the striker plate - your
striker plate may be excessively worn.  Also check for cracks in
the door - I've seen them crack around the latch area.

&gt; All my rubber is new, completely around the bus.  My passenger door
&gt; closes tight.  My driver's side door closes tight but has just a little 
&gt; alignment problem in that it sticks out maybe 1/8&quot; from the body.
&gt; 
&gt; When it rains, the door will not stay shut.  It will seem like it is 
&gt; latched, but if I turn right it flies open.  A good bump and it's open.
&gt; If I slam it from the middle of the door, the toggle latch closes, but 
&gt; doesn't grab the post.  If I slam it from the back of the door, it 
&gt; seems to shut (it hasn't come open at least).
