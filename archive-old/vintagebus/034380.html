mmmmmmm....

Thing is you have changed your bushes (which might
be part of the problem...).  My first bet would be
that whoever put em in MAY have 'expanded' up
an end (reducing ID) by overzealous pressing or drifting.

You probably need to do
some measuring to determine where the problem is
(bushes could need reaming to get back to correct ID).
Note this could be the problem with the 'tight' pin
but not the 'loose' 8-(.......

You probably need to measure your 'new' pins etc etc.

You can mix'n' match.  Clean up the old cages
and make sure that none of the bearings just 'drop out'.
If the old cages clean up OK (bearings don't fall out - no
galling or whatever)  you can mix them with the new
parts to achieve 'best' fit....

&gt; well in fact i took out the pin and the needle bearing cage crumbled and
&gt; the
&gt; pin was grooved, the bushing looks ok,  anyway my old pins were ok , i was
&gt; replaceing the spindle because of play in the king pin, im wondering if i
&gt; should just use the old pins and cages, these new cages look crappy
&gt; ,plastic
&gt; and have two halves, the old ones were one piece and metal,   anybody ??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In my experience when fitting *new* pins and bushes
&gt; &gt; the bush is a tight interference fit but installed using a drift...
&gt; &gt; i.e.,  moves in quire smoothly but is tight.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The bearings and pins (greased) slide in (no tapping required)
&gt; &gt; but are tight and have no perceptible up and down play.
&gt; &gt; I'm wondering whether the bearings are actually going
&gt; &gt; to roll in your 'tight' side.
