&gt;At the risk of being tied to a stake by the list, enough Bob Hoover.
I once
&gt;e-mailed Bob, before I knew about the list. I tried to be polite and
ask him
&gt;a simple question about rebuilding an engine.
&gt;
&gt;In short he was a D**K. He told me I should drive a Toyota and not a
VW for
&gt;a daily driver and that was what he does. When I got on the list I
saw how
&gt;everyone praising this guy. Maybe this lead to his arrogance. I can
also see
&gt;now how he probably gets about a million e-mails a day with dumb
questions.
&gt;Maybe he was just having a bad day and took it out on me.
&gt;
&gt;But because of his self praise and A**hole attitude, I DELETE
EVERYTHING
&gt;from, to, or about Bob Hoover.

Same thing happened to me when I wrote to ask his advice on being able
to drive my '65 Bus 3 miles ROUND TRIP at no more that 35 mph daily.
He had told someone else they weren't equipped to make some really
long trip, so I thought for sure he'd laugh and say of course MY trip
was fine.  Not so!  He told me nearly the same thing and made me feel
stupid for suggesting such a ridiculous thing--told me antique cars
aren't meant to be driven dialy unless you have the mechanic's
experience that HE does.  I haven't had any trouble with this short,
SLOW distance and am not sure what all the fuss was about.  I'm sorry,
but this struck me as rather arrogant too, so I never will ask HIM for
advice again either.  I'll ask the kinder people on the list who can
lead me in the right direction without making me feel stupid.  He must
have been having a bad day that day too.  Too bad someone who could be
such a huge resource to us has to act like the VW God.
