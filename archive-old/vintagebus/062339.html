The fad of the aftermarket distributor has been with VW engines since the
early sixties. Everyone trying to squeeze the extra ponies they knew must be
hiding in there somewhere. And in truth, the after market parts do squeeze
out extra horses at the cost of longevity. VW was conservative to the
extreme with their choices of parts for this little motor. They wanted
something that would operate reasonably well in most environments for as
little money as possible to manufacture. Remember, this was supposed to be
the peoples car. Workers could save up enough stamps to finally buy their
own vehicle. At least that was supposed to be how it worked until the
British and Americans bombed their factories. The rebuilding of the
factories by the British and Americans at wars end enabled mass produced
vehicles to be available again in that war torn country, but the original
ideal stayed, a low cost car that ran reasonably well in most environments.
As to the original distributors, your Bentley and other manuals ought to
properly give you the correct distributor number for your year engine,
barring no later modifications. The research is your job and the swap meet
parts can be a gold mine.

One reason might be that it seems almost impossible to get the
correct distributor for, say, a 1600.  You can get as many  different
answers about which one to use as people you ask.  Since the 009 is
the only distributor that's widely available, and since it's so easy
to tune up, and since it works so well on Type I, you find it
everywhere.  Sure you can get piles of distributors at swap meets, but
who really knows which one to use?
