Subject: Re: [VB] Divider Felt info

does this mean gas tank felts will work for truck gas tank panels?

&lt;&lt; The felts are 4 long strips covering the entire perimeter, same width and
 material as the gas tank felts. Also - oval type holes are punched into the
 felt so once it was glued to the divider, it would match up to the oval
 holes on the divider so you can adjust the divider with the screws started.
 I will take some pics of some felts tommorow, my camera is out of batts.
 Also ill take some pics of the correct bubble head sheet metal phillips
 screws with fat washers for you. I remember you asking about what kind they
 were etc. Actually ill just scan the screws and send them to you.
