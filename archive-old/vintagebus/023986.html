Subject: barndoor dealer catolog, what year?

Picked up an early barndoor dealer catolog today and don't know what
year it is. It shows single cabs with smooth side gates and none of the
other buses have rear bumpers except the 23 window and it has the alum
trim on rear corners, even has a nice picture of a double door panel
( like the 54 I used to own ). Shows an amblance also. I think it is
a 52 or 53, but how can I tell for sure? Thanks

John ( Still didnt get to the b/d panel in the pool yet ) Howard
