Subject: More end play

Well, I've got another question.

I re-measured about 10 times and it looks like the end play with no
shims is .027.  So to get it to .004 I need a stack of .023....right?
What's the smallest (thickness) shim I can expect to get?  The smallest
I have now is .009.  Obviously 3 of those will be 0 end play...not good.

Can I run with only two shims?.....None? I'd suspect not.

Thanks .  BTW I won't be driving this motor to octo tomorrow :-(

Steve
