But how can you have your bus up for auction on two websites? What if there 
are two different highbidders?

     hi there well I live in southern california it will cost me a grip to 
 ship it also and I dont do any body work and the bus will need more then 
 half of the metal replaced if you can deliver I can pay you $500 let me 
 know thanks take care good luck
 
 This was on my 57 Standard Sunroof bus  I had on there. His bid was 
 $500. I obviously haven't had enough alcohol tonight to comprehend this 
 email. I clearly stated no shipping, and there were plenty of pics to 
 see the bus throughout the auction. Some peoples kids....
     Sorry, I dont normally rant, but its friday and this guy obviously 
 isn't playing with a full deck. Nothing against the auction, but this
 guy has to go.
