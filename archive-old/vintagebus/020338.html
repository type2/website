To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

After talking to some folks at the classic, it looks
like the rear seat luggage bar on my bus is for a 67
only.  It is shorter by about 4&quot;.

Does anyone have a earlier one either FS or for trade.
 All i need is the bar.

Another option is to just cut a new one.  anyone have
a source for metric sized (not sure what diameter yet)
aluminum tubing?

thanks
