Hi Ken,
&lt;&lt;I think he meant that the nuts keep loosening up on him.&gt;&gt;
Right, if the studs and the case savers are pulling out of engine case the
nuts will get looser and looser.  We have never heard of stock head nuts just
loosening.  So unless the nuts are not stock replacements they should not
loosen.  There are machinist fitting ratings for threaded fasteners.
 A. The nut will literally spin on to the bolt/stud.
 B. The nut will only move on the bolt/stud with fingers moving it.
 C. The nut will only move on the bolt/stud with a wrench.  
The stock head nuts should be a B classification fit.  Eric &amp; Barb
