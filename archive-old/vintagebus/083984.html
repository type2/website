Subject: Re: [VB] Late model gas tank retrofit

Hi Seth,
Get the 1968-71 tank.  It seals up properly to the body with no  shimming 
under it.  Plus you can install the pre-1962 reserve  switch in this earlier 
tank.  Very nice to be able to switch to &quot;Closed &quot;  position when replacing flex 
fuel line or removing the engine, and have no fuel  spillage problem.  Or be 
able to switch to &quot;Reserve&quot; position and have  about a gallon of fuel to get you 
to the next gas station, instead of having to  walk there, and back to your 
bus!!
