Subject: Sighting . . .

I can never pass a splitty when I see one parked somewhere. This morning, on 
the way home from the grave yard shift, I spot a blue '62ish bus parked at 
the curb. It has a full length roof rack (nice) and is outfitted with all the 
camper gear. As far as the Westy bit, I don't know - it may be a Sundial or 
another camper. The thing that made me step back is the double door feature. 
The installed camper gear seemed to support this, too. It did not look like a 
hack. I left a note (duh) and hope to hear from the owner to look closer and 
maybe snap a few pics.

I guess the big question is - How common was this package?
