Well, I don't really need a lot of HP since it will be driven only for a few
months a year, special occasions only. Longevity and dependability will be
my most concerns.  I'll probably pamper this baby for a while since there
was so much work involved with it so far and still ahead. All I want is to
bring this 1600cc to it's best. I've got Idiot's guide and Bentley but my
Bentley covers 1200 and 1500cc engines. It's OK though. I know Steve out of
Dundee, IL was going to work on his engine himself. Steve, e-mail me if
you'll do it. Perhaps I can learn a thing or two from you.
Thanks,
Andre Hryn

&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm ready to take mine apart since I have no idea what it went through
but
&gt; have a dilemma. What parts should I replace to make sure it works OK?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Andre,
&gt; Best to get and read the repair manuals like the Idiot's manual, Bentley
&gt; manual for your year engine, and How to Hot Rod Your VW Engine.  Then you
can
&gt; begine to ask specific questions and get better ansewers.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;What improvements should I make?&gt;&gt;
&gt; It all depends on what yu want from it.  High HP or longevity and good
MPG?
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; It's a dual port and I have a Solex 34 PICT-3 carb. Is it a trust
worthy
&gt; one? Should I be looking at something else?  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Stock dual port heads have a habit of cracking around the valve to spark
plug
&gt; area.  If you stay with DP you really should consider installing some
&gt; aftermarket CB041(?) DP heads that have the thicker casting to prevent
this.
&gt; Personally we hate the two extra rubber seals on the intake manifold that
can
&gt; leak and burn up a head on that side.  Also hate the way the DP manifolds
&gt; take up more room and make it harder to change spark plugs.  The carb is a
&gt; good one though a bit more tricky you can set it better than you can with
&gt; earlier carbs.   Eric&amp;Barb
