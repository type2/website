Subject: decklid hinges/locking latches

my driver's side decklid hinge is loose. The bolts just turn and turn. Is
there a plate in there like the ones for the cargo door hinges? Is there a
way to remedy this problem or am I screwed? when it is shut, everything is
AOK, so I can live with it, but I'd like to fix it.

Also, did they make locking decklid latches for 66? mine just has the button
with no key. I would like to lock my engine compartment because I want to
put a cutoff switch pn my battery to prevent theft. This would be in vain if
a possible theif could just go back there and flip the switch.
TIA
