Subject: I GIVE UP !!

It's taken about 4 months of being screwed over by anyone who had anything to
do with my bus for me to start HATING IT and wanting to just unload it.

I WEAR A &quot;KICK ME&quot; sign on my back !!!

Won't rehash all the screw jobs I got in the beginning, but want to share with
you the last two.

1)  Found another body guy ..great price, nice work.  The shop where I bought
the bus and had it reassembled was KIND ENOUGH to let this body guy with no
shop use their shop to do the body work on my bus for $100.

So the guy did the front .. I showed you that .. and the following day when he
was supposed to be working on MY BUS .. the shop owner STOLE HIM FROM ME and
had him working on my old bus, the 71 .. so now the 71 bus looks like new and
my new one looks like shit ...Then they have the nerve to say &quot;look diane,
look how great your old bus looks .. &quot;  To which I replied F U.   and after
blowing my top, the shop owner says &quot;but this is my shop diane, and so I
decide what gets done and when.&quot;

BUT IT DIDN'T END THERE .. oh no ...

2)  Remember the clunk ?? They all say &quot;don't worry .. it is nothing .. &quot; and
then there was this tiny oil leak .. they say .. &quot;don't worry .. it is
nothing... remember .. VW's don't leak oil they just leave ... &quot; I interrupted
them to say &quot;but this is a NEW ENGINE and I don't want to see it dripping oil
.. FIND THE LEAK AND FIX IT !!&quot;

So they decide it is coming from the rear main seal .. pull the engine and you
know that THUMP .. the &quot;don't worry it is nothing THUMP??&quot;  Well .. That
&quot;don't worry it is nothing THUMP apparently was a broken motor mount or who
knows what .. but my NEW ENGINE has a cracked block .. They are fixing it for
free .. but still .. I AM PISSED OFF ..

Maybe I will just put the damn thing on eBay and buy a NEW CAR ..

Diane
