Is this a darkish green bus that you bought in Olympia?

  Ok,
  I am ready to let go of it. The stunning reallity is that I have no time
 to restore this thing.  Here are the details:
 67 doormobile Green. Solid 1600 engine. New master cylinder, that needs to
  be installed. That was tough to find let me tell. ya. This is located in
 the
  Seattle area, and it would need to be towed. The camper part that makes it
 a
  dormobile is complete and in good condition. pops up with good canves.
 There
  is some rust on both bottom quarter panels. On small dent on the rear left
  corner. Interior is kinda beat. I am in the midst of trying to figure out
  the value of it, so any offers would be considered.
