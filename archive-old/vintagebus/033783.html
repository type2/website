Subject: RE: [VB] Cargo Doors

Matt, Katie &amp; I found this same problem when working on their new bus.
The chrome collar around the handle had become worn down and would
rotate in the door with the handle when locked. Maybe try the collar
from the other side or the back to see if that's the problem... ?

 I also have some difficulty with my cargo door Lock/Latch.  The key
locks  the barrel, but when turning the door handle, the &quot;Outer Sleeve&quot;
turns.  This sort of negates the locked barrel, and opens the door.  I
am wondering  if maybe the door mechanism is the wrong type/year for my
panel.  It looks  like there should be &quot;Stop for that &quot;outer sleeve&quot; to
wedge against, to  prevent it from turning.  I have taken a look in my
Bentley manual, but I don't see this outlined  anywhere.
  &gt;&gt;

the chromed collar around the handle turns as well?   the collar is used
for
years and years- all splittys? at least post bd   Remove the cargo door
handle  and collar, and check out to see whether the collar or the door
is
rounded- it should have a shape where the collar will not turn in the
door. Compare to someone else's split- is it the same collar?
