&lt;&lt; valves, checked the plugs, etc. When looking at the points and turning the
 engine, the points do not open and close.  I'm following the points
 adjusting procedure as suggested by Mr. Muir, and since one of the first
 steps is to check how the points open and close, I can't move on to the next
 step! I don't know what's going on. Is there something stupid that I am
 overlooking? Are my points bad?  The engine runs, I just have the backfiring
 problem.  I've never played with the timing or points before (16,000 miles
 on engine) so any tips are appreciated! Thank you!

Hey Derrick, grab a milk crate and park on it looking at your buses engine.   
The bus is out of gear, parking brake on.   Take a screwdriver and pry loose 
the clips from the distributor cap and set it to the side (leve the wires on 
it).   The rotor is the first thing you can get to in the distributor- you 
can pull it straight up off the distributor shaft.  Take the big wrench that 
fits the generator nut -usually 21mm or sometimes 19mm) and turn the engine 
round. See the rotor turn around- and the end of it with metal on it would 
spark in turn in the cap at each corner which leads to the plugs.  OK, pull 
the rotor off.   You may have a flatish plastic cover than keeps dirt out, 
pull that off too.   Now you should see the points.  the distributor shaft 
has bumps (cams) on it.   turn the motor round some more- see the pieace that 
is hit by the bump?  THat is the arm of the points that moves.  Now if you go 
turn the key so the lights on the dash are on, and turn the motor some more, 
you should see a spark jump between the points.    If you look doen you will 
see a slotted screw holding the points to the distributor.Hope this helps.
