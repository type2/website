&gt; Hey Happy Holidays to everyone........I received an email from a guy
&gt; from Business Week magazine a couple days ago wanting to ask questions
&gt; about our beloved micros. .....He told me VW is coming out with a New
&gt; Micro? He wanted to know what made the original so popular and what I
&gt; thought about a New bus coming out..... kinda cool.. I was just
&gt; wondering who else he contacted........I didn't even ask himwhen the
&gt; feature would come out! DUH! Must have been brain freeze. You'll have
&gt; that when it's 40 below and you've got snow up to your a$$!!!!!!! Wel
&gt; hey, everyone have a safe and happy new years celebration...See Ya
&gt; .....shawn

If true, this rumor probably reflects VW's looking at sales of N*w B**tles
and at demand for the PT cruiser and realizing that they could pop
something into that &quot;functional nostaligia&quot; niche and make a lot of money.
Heck, the bus must be the second most recognizable vehicle in the world,
after the b*g.  I just hope that they keep the price down way below the
current Eurovan tag.
