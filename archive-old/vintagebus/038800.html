To trade for a Bus:

Here’s what I have to barter...

1970 VW Beetle Convertible.  Looks good but really needs restoration.  A
good runner (wife drives it all summer) and I have about $900 worth of parts
to throw in...floorpans, heater channels, conv. reinforcements.  Needs new
top.  I was going to restore it but I lost interest after I acquired my 55
Pritschenwagen.  I have over $4000 into the car and will trade for a any
aircooled bus of similar value.

Located in Chicago.
