Subject: Re: [VB] Engine mount

Simplest fix: leave the threaded insert [because of
the doghouse oil cooler] and get a Allen head bolt
instead of a hex head bolt. The Allen head clears the
nubs in the trans bellhousing.

 I have a late model 1600 DP and the top left hand
 bolt hole on the engine has
 a threaded type bushing so the mount bolt threads in
 from the front. This is
 not handy for removal and replacement of the engine
 on the 61 Bus because the
 clutch lever makes it difficult to get a wrench on
 the bolt. It would be
 better if there was just a nut on the backside used
 with a halfmoon type bolt
 like the starter on the other side. Has anyone dealt
 with this problem?
