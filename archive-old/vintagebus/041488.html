&gt; hey bussers,
&gt; I'm wondering if the procedure is the same
&gt; as the type 1 for raising the rear end of the bus. Anything 
&gt; different about doing this on a bus? Any tips?
&gt; I saw a description this in a recent issue of VW trends.

The procedure is the same, but the settings are not.  Avoid the temptation
to crank in extra twist to carry your load, as this will result in rather
strange handling and tire wear.  Stick to the stock settings, which take
into account carrying a full load.  Buses usually look a bit nose-high
when parked, because the driver's weight isn't present.

&gt; I've got a Westy with an SO34 interior so it's a little back
&gt; heavy, especially with the rack and enough food on board to
&gt; circumnavigate the globe. I would like to get about 2 inches of
&gt; lift back there just to even things out. Also, I was wondering
&gt; what the lifespan  is on the Boge shocks. Should a 37 year
&gt; old set be good or does the oil in them go bad after a time?
&gt; They seem to be ok with 35k miles on them. Just wondering 
&gt; if I should grab a set while they're hot. 

It's not the oil that wears out, it's the piston or valves.  If the shock
passes the &quot;bouce test&quot; it should be OK.

George
