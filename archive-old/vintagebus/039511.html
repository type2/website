&gt;Wow are you going to catch some flak for this!!! I wouldnt do it, I loved
&gt;reduction boxes, such a neat idea......anyway.......

First I liked them too , it is like the mercedes unimog setup but at the end 
it is swing axle which I dont like ...

&gt;Avoid this simple solution of mounting to the oil pump cover, it doesnt 
&gt;need
&gt;or like the extra stress. Lets look at a few things:

Finally I found the kit but it seems that it is attached to pump cover and 2 
more holes it has to mount somewhere else too . you can see it at 
:http://www.larrysoffroad_dot_com/item34160.ctlg?orderId=&amp;custId=


&gt;1. If you have a case that can be tapped to accept the screws do that.
&gt;2. IF you dont, with all the trouble of making it IRS get a universal 
&gt;case.0
&gt;3. Use a drag race type bar (you can order one) to make a carrier that 
&gt;holds
&gt;the engine up.

I will take a look at my engine this weekend and see if it has the place to 
drill and tapp the hanger if so the problem is solved using a 69 hanger ..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Why, oh why do you want to do this? What do you think you will accomplish?
&gt;There are many aftermarket parts to make your conering better. I hate
&gt;lowering, but a lowered bus with a rear stablizer will be a better solution
&gt;to handling then a welded in IRS.

Well , to corner like nuts I have a lowered bug , for my bus I like IRS ride 
it really is better ,longer gear ratios and ability to run 60 mph, why I 
hate swing with redux. is when U accelerate it lifts the back of the bus .. 
as beeing an ex-vanagon driver I love vanagon's cornering and comfort that 
is what I want with my split . You wont belive me but IRS is a better 
off-roader also (I like stock ride height) , when the swing cambers as you 
apply power it looses traction ...

&gt;
&gt;Jason.
&gt;(I shouldnt be here, I dont even have a split anymore, but the 70 runs 
&gt;great
&gt;now with 15 inch wheels, low profile and a 1776 with a BIG ASS oil filter 
&gt;on
&gt;it!!!!!!!!!)
yeah you prefer T2 ride too, I have fitted 69 balljoint front-end as a 
result with IRS I will have a split with 69 running gear ..
