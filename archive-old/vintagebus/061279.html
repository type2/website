Subject: Re: [VB] Mango Green - Seagull Grey

It's going to depend on what brand and product line you use.  Omni is cheap and easy
to use, but itsn't that great of a paint.  PPG CLV is a better paint, mid-range price-wise,
and is easy to use.  Glasurit or Sikkens are better paints, but harder to use and much
more expensive.  As far as color codes, your best bet is to actually take pieces down
to the paint shop and have them mix the color according to your sample.  There might be
a formula for MG/SG, but there's no guarantee that their rendition looks like what you
think MG/SG should be.  I have a friend who'd love to sell you a gallon of &quot;coral red&quot;
he had mixed &quot;to formula&quot; that looks like the results of an unsatisfactory dining experience
at Taco Bell.

&gt; I'm trying to track down codes for Mango Green and Seagull Grey.  I do not need the L346 and L347 things but the formulas to mix that paint. I would also like some advice on the best type of paint to use. I am a complete novice painter and I think I'll try and do most of the prep work for my bus out side and either rent a spray booth or build one for actual painting. I was planning on using R-M paint but when I went to pick up the paint and epoxy primer and the high build primer the colour was way way off.  I want to use epoxy primer so what ever type of paint I use in the engine bay should work well with it. I had hoped to paint the engine bay and the interior of my bus this weekend - damn.
