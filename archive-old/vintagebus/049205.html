Maybe shorty trucks and busses were an attempt to put the driver closer to the heater?  Search the archives for heat tips, there was a lot of ideas a year or two ago. Fill all the leaks above the engine seal, make sure the flaps &amp; thermostat work, seal up the heat ducts, insulate the long tube and put the pedal pan on the front. 

Look for those weird rotating pizza cookers in the spring yard sales. 3 or 4 of 'em around a part should be able to cook 'em. The drying cycle of a dishwaser gets pretty damn hot without any water to absorb the heat.
