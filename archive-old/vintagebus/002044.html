 Sent in my money and info a few months ago and got a reply today. here's
what they said.

 Your enquiry about vehicle data

 The Stifung AutoMuseum Volkswagen likes to research data of your old
Volkswagen vehicle from the vehicle database and to draw up a &quot;Vehicle
identity certificate&quot;.

 However, because of technical difficulties in the archive of Volkswagen AG
we are not able to research any data of vehicles at the moment.

 We hope we can offer this service from July on again.

 We ask for your understanding.

 Yours faithfully

 Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen

 They sent back the same $20 bill i sent to them ( had a VWHOWARD on it) so
will resubmit in July.

 On the road again this weekend to Prescott Az.
