&gt; this sounds like a good idea, i think i saw you post something like this
&gt; before. but it sounds like it will not be possible to get at the bolt-given
&gt; the doghouse oil cooler being in the way.

Not only is it a good idea, but the bolt is easy to glue in from under the
bus, and the nut is easy to access and hook the flat ratchet wrench around to
loosen or tighten. There is just enough clearance between the doghouse and
the nut on the bolt's end to hook the tool onto, and it works fast and
easy.

When I remove or install my engine, I'm under there for a few minutes
dealing with the two lower nuts and the heater cables. That's it.
Everything else is done from the rear in relative comfort. This includes
the fuel line connection, accel cable, and the two upper nuts. I can have
my engine in/out in little more than the time it takes to remove the rear
bumper and roll the floor jack in place.
