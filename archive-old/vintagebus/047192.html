&lt;&lt;Hey,
I work at VWoA , and they want me to analyze the opinions about the microbus.
The new designed Microbus on your web page is the first one I found that  
really looks good!!!!
If you have more comments and suggestions! I would be happy to forward them!

Well there ya go.  Sorry about bringing up this NM thing.  Im also suprised 
that I didnt get a letter from the VWoA sharks due to all the VW logos and 
trademarks on my site =) suckers

After the rains here in phx I noticed that I have a little rust forming in my 
parcel tray.  Damn safaris!!  Anyway, I was planning on blasting the tray and 
painting it back to L87.  I want to POR15 it if I can but need to know two 
things:

1.  Which Product to use
2.  Can POR15 be painted over and will the paint quality be ok?
