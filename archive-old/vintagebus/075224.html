Subject: Made a list of locals

I made a list of local people ..from the AIDA [I think that is correct] web
site.  A few scared me.  Like one that said &quot;the best mechanic in town is
Raycar.&quot;  I won't go into a long story about me - my bug - and Raycar .. but
lets just say, they fixed my &quot;fuel leak smell.&quot;  Before I left I said &quot;I still
smell gas.&quot;  And Ray said &quot;it is OLD gas, from an old leak .. it will go
away.&quot;  So I left and 20 miles down the road, my bug burnt to the ground.  My
extinguisher was no help, because the clamp was missing off a line going to
the carb.  That's what the fireman wrote in his report .. Raycar carries NO
liability insurance .. another many thousands of dollars I had to eat .. that
was 3 or 4 years ago.  I haven't been back since.

But I have a list now .. I am reading the idiot book while I finish off my
second pot of coffee... when it cools off some, I will make room to drive the
bus in the garage and pull it up on the &quot;things&quot; [whatever they are called]
and get under the bus with a light, take many many pictures and start ALL OVER
..

Going to call the names on the list and get recommendations for mechanics ..
if they recommend mine .. or Raycar .. I will just move on to the next ..
don't know if I dare tell anyone my stories .. Maybe just showing them my
pictures will be enough .. who knows ...

Diane
