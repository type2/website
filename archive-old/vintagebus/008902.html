Having just re-built a tranny, the parts are fresh in the mind (nothing else
seems to be lately). The fork that engages reverse is activated through a
riveted pivot pin. The location of this pivot is adjustable as is the
attachment at the selector rod. This sounds to me like the adjustment screw
on the selector rod has come loose or the riveted pivot point has failed.
The adjustment for the pivot point is unlikely to have moved or changed. In
any case if you eliminate the rest of the probable causes like front mount
and shift rod coupling, then you are looking at pulling the gear carrier out
of the transmission. Sorry to be the bearer of the news, I hope it's the
transmission mount.

&gt; I have a 67 splitty that has a gremlin in reverse. Sometimes it works and
&gt; sometimes it does'nt. What is strange about it is that when it works,
&gt; everything seems to work fine. Good engagement and no sign of slippage.
When
&gt; it does'nt, it seems that everything is working, ie., shifter and such
feels
&gt; normal, but theres no go. It acts as if it is not in gear. All forward
gears
&gt; work fine. Is it possible that the shift fork or the reverse gear is
&gt; slipping?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, John
