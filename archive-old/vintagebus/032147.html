Seriously now
Can anyone tell me how to remove the bezel/glass off the front of the
fuel gauge in my 65 Westy? I pulled it but I could not see a way to pull
the glass off and get to the internal parts
-  -- -  -- -
take the guage out and carefully peel back the lip of the bezel around the out
side where it is by the body of the guage .   The bezel the glass and a little
seal will come off.  

what are you wanting to do w/ the innards?  Inquiring minds want to know
