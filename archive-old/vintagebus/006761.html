1776 single port with a freeway flyer (3.88  r/p  82 4th) cruised without a
problem, loaded or empty, if I can archive some pics, you will see the panel
loaded front to rear top to bottom going to the Jerome Event, average 20+mpg
no heat or any problems to speak of. This bus was also used for all events,
average 300 to 1000 mile trips almost monthly, I used this combo for over 2
1/2 years before selling the bus, which now resides in Utah and is used to
haul herds of dogs around.
At the Last Jerome, Uncle Willy drove it there fully loaded and cruising in
our caravan at the VWHoward busavan regulated speed of 52 mph had no
heating, cooling, pucking or spitting problems and got approx. 27 mpg, I use
to get 20 mpg but I also like to cruise at 65-70 mph and in 100 plus heat on
300 mile runs I never had a problem, of course I took my gauges out and let
them burn up in my shop fire last year and after that figured WTH they
didn't do me any good anyway, bus ran fine for over 2 1/2 years without them
and is still going strong. For some strange reason why is it always the
people with the gauges haveing all the problems with there buses???

I've got a real concern here folks.  I haven't put my 1776 in the bus yet
but it's gonna HAVE to happen before the July 15th OVWC show in Omaha, NE.
Here's what I'm concerned about.

It's no secret that putting a freeway flier trans in a bus drops the rpm of
the engine in relation to the speed of the vehicle.  With my 1600DP and a
mild load, it just can't hack it - I was driving floored back from KCMO.
The engine was working really hard too.

Does this mean that no matter what Type 1 engine size  I run (anything from
a 1600DP up to a big old 2.2 litre), I'm condemned to overheating or will
the 1776 give me enough power gains to pull me out of this slump?  Even
though I like to cruise fast in the bus, I don't like running hot so I'm
half tempted to yank my flier and sell it and run the stock 67 trans.

I'd like to hear comments and real world experiences.  Thanks!
