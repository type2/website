Hi Phil,
Whoops, you assumed!  You do know what happens when you do that don't you?

&lt;&gt;

When the engine has been run for at least ten minutes with the thermostatic 
flaps in place the pistons and rings will have swelled up to seal even better 
than when the engine is cold.  So your true compression PSI is probably much 
higher!  So go ahead and do one now that you have it running.  Compression 
reading should be optimally about 120-130PSI with anything below 100 PSI 
probably being junk and hopefully the Compression PSI are within 10 from each 
other.  As for your gauge problem get one from a wrecking yard from a 70s or 
early 80s WCVW.
