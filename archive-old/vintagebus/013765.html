Subject: [VB] oiled clutch disk
Message-ID: &lt;19991026134456.2441.qmail_at_www0s_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Has anyone ever successfully gotten oil out of a clutch disc? Mine got
   a small amount of engine oil in it and now it slips on hard
   acceleration. I'm too cheap to buy a new one so any kind of shade-tree
   fix would be appreciated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I've tried doing this with a propane torch and tried heating the material (not
burning it) and then spraying it with solvent to wash it off.  Live
dangerously!

Did it work?  Not very well, but it worked some.  The disk DID chatter less,
and I'm still living.  Try un-glazing the pressure plate and the flywheel with
a whet stone.  Now, THIS WORKS!
