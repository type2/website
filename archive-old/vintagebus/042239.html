If you're not planning on running high RPMs, you don't need these.

&gt; solid rocker shafts/swivel feet adjusters

If you aren't running high RPMs and the requisite stiff valve springs, the
stock shaft/rocker/adjuster will do fine.  The stock adjusters are easier
to adjust properly and it's hard to screw up the stock geometry.

It's a religious argument, but the stock points are pretty darned reliable
and don't tend to die in unfixable ways like the electronic gizmos.

Keep the lines short and mount the filter upright so that you can fill it
before installation.  The HP-1 filter is a good idea unless you make
provisions for a pressure bipass.  Myself, I just change oil at reasonable
intervals.

&gt; balance it, too

Always a good idea!

Of course, if you simply want a reliable engine, the Mexican longblocks
are pretty hard to beat.  bolt in and go!
