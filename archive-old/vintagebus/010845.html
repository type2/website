&lt;&lt; I have 3 pearl white busses...well two and a truck.  The 65 and 67 busses 
say
 pearlweis (on a sticker) but the 62 says WHITE on the M-Plate.  Go figure.
 
  &gt;&gt;
they changed the configuration of the M code plate between 62 and 65- I think 
for 63 or 64?   

The earlier style has the day-mo-year date on the top, and the colour written 
in the middle of the lowest line

the later style has day-mo date on top line, and the colour is in code, you 
get a sticker underneath with german writing the name of the colour(s) and 
the L code

why written in english &quot;White&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot;?   maybe cause it is N Am spec, 
perhaps those euro spec have it written in German.  Just a guess.  ANy input?
