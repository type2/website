I was thinking of the BD safaris they make, which are ~$700 or so - I
hadn't priced the &quot;mortal&quot; safaris :)

Heck, all the others charge in the $400+ range - I see no reason NOT to go
with CE!

Of course you're going to provide the list with all the contact info again,
right?

&gt;My Creative safaris cost me a total of $475 US to get here....I've heard of 
&gt;originals going for up in the $600 dollar range...
