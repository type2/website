&gt; Today I located a weird bus and hope for
&gt; clarification. Apologies ahead of time for the baybus
&gt; question- but here it goes:
&gt;
&gt; VIN = 231-2090-570 confirmed behind psgr. side seat,
&gt; door pillar sticker of driver side and dashboard VIN
&gt; tag. Sticker clearly reads 11/70 as production date
&gt; (for 1971 model year).
&gt;
&gt; Weirdness:
&gt; 2.&gt; Bench model! 1/3-2/3 seat

Could be had in a bay.

&gt; 3.&gt; No interior push-pull door lock knobs on front
&gt; doors. (no hole or mechanisms per factory)

normal for a '71.  Locks were with the latch toggles.

&gt; 4.&gt; No interior slider lock handle/switch.
&gt; 5.&gt; Factory roof indentation &lt;exterior&gt; 3&quot; x 1/8&quot; deep
&gt; x width of roof.

Normal on bay buses.

&gt; 6.&gt; Shortie bumper over-riders with rubber pads.
&gt; Barely taller than bumper blade top/btm.

Probably accessory.

&gt; 7.&gt; Ker-*Delog*-Bund front windshield logo (is this
&gt; common? I thought that name was only in old splits.

My '71 has a delog windshield

&gt; 9.&gt; MANUAL choke knob in front seat stand ala 1950's
&gt; splitty. Heater knob on dash as all bays.

Sure the knob in the seat stand isn't the heat knob for the middle seat?
that's what it is on mine.

&gt; Bus is in great straight condition with worn OG paint.
&gt;
&gt; Being a splittie guy I am surprised on the oddities. I
&gt; have heard/read of the benchseat model bays before.
&gt; eight pgr vs. seven?

9 passenger with full-width middle seat was the usual configuration.

&gt;
&gt; Please fill me in via pmail at ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com
&gt; Thanks,
