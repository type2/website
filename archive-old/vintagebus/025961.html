Fellow listees -

I am trying to find a custom powder coat color for my rims and bumpers.
As far as I can tell, the correct color for my Crew Cab rim faces and
bumpers is Bright White (or Silver White - PPG DCC8251).  The inner area
and backside of the rims should be semi-gloss black.  I can get the
semi-gloss black with absolutely no problems.  The white has become
somewhat of a problem to get in powder coat.  The one place I have
located in my area that will actually duplicate the color has told me I
need an order of at least $2,000 to make it worth their while.  I figure
that as long as I can rustle up at least 7 other people looking for
about the same thing, we call all get it done for a reasonable price.  I
sent all my rims yesterday to get straightened out, so I would expect to
get them back in about two weeks.  At that time, I hope to have them
coated and new tires installed.  If anyone is interested in getting some
of their parts done in the correct white, please let me know.  By the
way, I live in Annapolis, MD and the powder coater is in New Jersey.
