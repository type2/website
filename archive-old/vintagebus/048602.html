&gt;&gt; Westfalia never offered a floor until 65 I believe.
&gt;&gt; Ask todd s. about that one.
&gt;&gt; Todd, where are you?
&gt;
&gt;AFAIK the first Westy tent with a floor was the &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; or
&gt;&quot;Drive-Away&quot; tent offered for the '68 models.  That tent was also the
&gt;first Westy tent (since at least mid-50's) with an external frame.  In
&gt;fact the two features are probably related.


Joe,
I don't claim to be an expert on anything, hey I'm just a teacher, but I do
have a late model '67 westy with the drive away tent that has a floor and 2
pockets for the carge doors, one on each side.  The tent is the blue and
orange one, with the external frame and striped awnings.

And on that note, it is now 3:05 pm, time to go home and play with my
busses!  We may not get payed much, but have nice working hours.

Ramblings from an old shop teacher,
