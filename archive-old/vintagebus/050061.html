Subject: Re: 8 track player (was: Introduction)

&gt;This may be a little off topic, but what kind of 8-track player was it? I'm
&gt;looking to put one in my '75 bus. Thanks.


It's a Sears Roebuck, w/ AM/FM stereo radio.

I just found that I have the original manual to this stereo:

Dashmate
Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Model No. 638.50483
Solid-State Stereo 8-Track Tape Player with AM &amp; FM Stereo Radio
Specifications
Installation
Operating Instructions



Anyone interested?
