&lt;&lt; I am needing a few things....specifically a 6v flywheel, '66 year, so that 
it 
 will accommodate a 6v starter and a 200 mm clutch (on a 1600 DP motor). &gt;&gt;
Hi Zac,
You might be able to find a shop that does flywheel repair in your area.  
Then if you have a 12 volt 200mm flywheel with bad gear teeth they should be 
able to machine off the teeth, and press on a new 6 volt ring gear on it.  
Just make sure to have it balanced afterwards.  Eric&amp;Barb
