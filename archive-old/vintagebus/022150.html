&gt;the pictures and vin it appears to be very early 67, care to confirm

Definitely a '67.  Giveaway is on rside.jpg. Finger pull instead of 
church-key latch on gas filler.

&gt;Here is a question I really want answered from the Stock VW Nazi's out 
&gt;there.  My late 67 came w/68-71 cabinet handles not the really nice 
&gt;more plastic than rubber type handles, are these stock?

They are stock for late '67 SO-42 Westys.
