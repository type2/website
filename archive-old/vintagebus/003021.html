I think Jerry is alittle steamed about the $100 charge for new parts vendors
swap space. I don't blame him either as they put us used parts sellers next
to the new parts venders and only charge us $35 which includes  entery for 2
people also. so are swap space alone comes to $11 when you deduct the gate
fee.
 Ronnie and I will be going. Its the debut of the new and improved 63
turquoise DD panel. Stop by the swap area and say hello.

 John Howard
