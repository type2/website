I bet if you were in your bus they would have noticed
you.

&gt; I know this will be trivial, but I ran up behind a
&gt; brown (I think) split bus
&gt; this last monday, MLKday, and tried to have my wife
&gt; take a picture while I
&gt; was trying to change lanes. I am pretty sure it was
&gt; someone from the list,
&gt; but not 100%.
&gt; So, if you were in Reno, and there was a maniac in a
&gt; blue minivan with a
&gt; crazy woman trying to take your picture after going
&gt; thru the spaghetti bowl
&gt; south bound, it was me. P-mail me.

&gt; BTW, the 2 pictures that she took were not good at
&gt; all, the sun was behind
&gt; you. LOL
