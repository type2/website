Subject: Lever shocks needed
Date: Thu, 26 Nov 1998 21:28:13 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I need a set of rear lever shocks for my '55 Barndoor Kombi.

The Bus currently has some bolt-on lower shock mounts that allow 'normal'
shocks.  The driver's side just broke again and I noticed the driver's side
tire is wearing irregularly.  It appears my only course is to find a
'correct' set of lever shocks.  I need the mounting hardware, too, but would
settle for just the shocks.

This is my daily driver so please, please contact me if you have a set or
know someone who does.

There is a good set of lever shocks on there but the arms were cut off,
don't know if just the arms could be replaced...

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
