Subject: A/C in a bus

Dave E. was talking about putting a/c in his '68 crewcab, and I owed him
several favors, so I gave him a setup from of a Ghia that was given to
me... I don't know if he's gotten around to installing it... Dave?

Has anyone on the list installed a/c in a splitty? If so, I'd kinda like
to know details... underdash, from beetle or ghia? What size engine?
Cooling a whole bus or a SC or DC? Condensor mounted where? How well
does it work, etc...

david
