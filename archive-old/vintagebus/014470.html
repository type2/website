Subject: Re: Redux Box Bolt Problems
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I've ben following this thread VERY closely (printing out replies keeping them
in my &quot;book&quot;) because one of the main reasons our bus has been taken off the
road is becasue it also was getting VERY squirly on downshifts and breaking.
It also doesnt have an engine at the moment, but that's another story.

one of our redux boxes shears off bolts.  They were constantly needing to be
replaced.   I saw the one reply about the oval holes, but what actually causes
this breaking of bolts??............are they just weak bolts??.....might we
also have ovaled out holes that's causing this or are we going to need
new/rebuilt redux boxes??

Please help

Also, before getting too detailed in a response, please keep in mind that this
bus is 500 miles away and I cant walk out back and look to see if the holes
are ovaled out or look at anything for that matter.

thanks

Matt

P.S.  in response to Nat'l drive your VW to work day, I drove out new 71
Notchback to work today (bought July 3rd), took the long way even (8 miles
instead of 6) and was rather disappointed in the turn out.  I made an effort
to make eye contact with every other VW driver I saw from new Jetta's to super
beetles and 1 splitty and no one seemed to be aware of this momentus day.  Oh
well.  I drove ours.  grinned the whole way and had a great time.
