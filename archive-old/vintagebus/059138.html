&gt; I've poked around on the internet and have found a number of *German* 1500

&gt; the same manufacturer?

I've used Liestrietz and Ernst.  The first is much better than the second.
The Ernst isn't as bad as Brazilian, but the fit is so much worse than the
Liestrietz. And there is that annoying little tab between the muffler and
the the tab on the resonator that don't even come close to lining up.
That part just doesn't seem German.  Seems more Taiwanese.
