To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i was looking through some of my internet vw pics
today and i saw a bus in the background that looked
like it had the scoops on backwards! does this make
sense to anyone? would this really do anything?

&gt; Hi I foun dthis in my outgoing mail box, so here it
&gt; is:
&gt; 
&gt; There is tons in the archives about side scoops.
&gt; check it out.   I think they 
&gt; are ugly (U. G. L. Y. you ain't got no alibi, you're
&gt; ugly), and took them off 
&gt; my daily driver.  Heard things both ways about
&gt; whether they help or not, I 
&gt; really don't know.
