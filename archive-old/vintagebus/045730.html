I guess I should have mentioned that my bus is a rolling shell.  This van has
already had new doglegs, frame sections, rockers, and cab and cargo floors
welded in placeby another shop.  The majority of the panels are Das Bulli.  I
wish that they all were! (although I am generally unhappy with Das Bulli's cab
floor stampings).  I have spoken to the shop owner and in his stating that I
was picky he was trying to let me know that the perfect way was not the only
way.  For me it is!  I believe that he was doing this because I am young.  I
am 19 and  I look about 17.  So I think he was trying to keep the price within
a reasonable budget.  I just want it done right and am perfectly willing to
pay to have it done right.  Once he wrote it all down (pickiness includedl) he
gave me an estimate.  $3500.  I expected it to be more (but I didn't care to
tell him that..).  I spoke with him about my worries about his quality
standards and he said that he just had never seen anyone go so in-depth as me
on a Volkswagen.  He thought it was really neat that I wanted to do it right.
So this afternoon I am going to sit down with him to discuss scheduling of
work and payment as well as paint codes and door jambs... (he doesn't know how
the two tone is supposed to work in the jambs or on the hidden edges of the
doors, I will straighten him out...)  Then it off to my stock broker...(yuck)
I have taken pictures of it in its current state, will take more as the
progress unfolds... wish me luck~!
Thanks to all who advised,
Dan (64 EZ)
