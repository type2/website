&gt; &lt;&lt;  Personally, and I think most others would agree that almost 20
thousand is
&gt;  EXPENSIVE for an un-restored bus.  What bus are you specifically talking
&gt;  about selling for 45K??  As far as I know the green slider sat  untouched
&gt;  for 40K as did Lenny's 54 at 50K.   Where are all the buyers for these?
&gt;
    Lenny at WCC sold the '54 deluxe for $48,000 .Then the new owner found a
'51 deluxe and decided
older is better and is going to have Lenny restore that one and have Lenny
sell the '54 for the meager asking price
of $53,000.
    I had the pleasure of driving the '54 last weekend and I must say it
drives like a dream !!!
Very quiet and comfortable.I was doing 65 mph and still had a little pedal
left !  (it has a 36hp in it not a 25hp.)
