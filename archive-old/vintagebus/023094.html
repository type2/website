&gt;Hey guys---
&gt;I've got some cab roof panels from WW just about in my '59.  they need to go 
&gt;just an inch further on the middle corners and will be ready for screws,
but, 
&gt;they aren't budging a bit??? I've worked for an hour to no avail?? any tips??

They're too big!  I had to cut about 1&quot; of the edges of mine to get them to
fit.  Lay them down next to an original and you'll see what I mean.

&gt;BTW---I've asked before, but, what size and type of fastener do cab dividers 
&gt;use???

10mm head hex bolts
