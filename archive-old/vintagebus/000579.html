&lt;&lt;I'll be out in the Whittier, Southern California area from this Friday-on

without a VW.  Any listees nearby to Whittier, going to the OCTO meet, and

want to give me a ride to the OCTO meet?   You name the time and place

Sunday am and I'll be there.  Gotta keep my rep and arrive in a VW...  :)
