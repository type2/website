    Thats why I found the gas heater out of a semi tractor sleeping cabin
that I post a couple of weeks ago! Some semi's have these installed so while
the driver sleeps he doesn't have to run his motor all night and still can
stay warm.
It's German made by Hebasto! easily converted to gasoline! A thermostat!!!
Very small and quiet! Extremely efficient with electric and gas!!! .Cost me
a hundo.The kicker is it fits perfectly under the back seat of my 64
Westy.bad news I have to drill 9 holes into my bus minimum.But it will keep
the bus dry and warm..

ps. I got it running on my work bench.I haven't installed mine yet, but a
buddy of mine has one also and he lives in the north woods of Wisc. and it
works GREAT.I finish installing mine next week&gt;

&gt; I was curious about this so I called a local supplier.  The B1LC model
&gt; that can replace the old ones is a whopping $1400!!!  The guy on the
&gt; phone stated that there just about the best you can buy though.
&gt;     Just thought anyone out there who's really cold, and has money to
&gt; burn, would be interested.
