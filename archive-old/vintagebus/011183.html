HI I noticed you were from knoxville tn . you mentioned you were
interested in some baby webbers . i have a set im thinking of getting
rid of  no linkage  and also have a 65 micro in real rough shape i was
trying to sell real cheap but it is a real project . i have never seen
your bus in knoxville i have only seen 2 different busses here in town
