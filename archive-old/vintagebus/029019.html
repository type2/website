Yah, A/C in a bus didn't seem like a good idea at the time and I
didn't have all the parts.  I gave most of the parts to a local
shop/junkyard (Hugh at Offroad Buggy Supply).  I sent the
double belt engine pully to Bob Hoover who was going to use it
in his propane convertion bus or some damn thing.
