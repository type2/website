Subject: Gas Tank Problem

I have a 61 Panel with nonstock tank, I'm not sure from what, but it holds
more than 10 gallons. The filler neck looks kind of messed up, like a locking
cap has been pryed off. The problem is when I put a stock cap on it doesn't
vent and suction pressure builds. I have been using a screw on cap that
doesn't seal but vents through the center. It leaks after I fill up and make
left turns or park in the carport that slopes right.

I would not be opposed to putting a stock tank back in with the reserve hooked
up. Anybody have one in good shape?
