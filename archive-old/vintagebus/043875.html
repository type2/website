Hi Clara,

at least this is one case where they probably cant say &quot;we dont have
parts for them&quot; as the law requires they take care of recalls.  My 87
scirocco with 89k on it got a free gas tank a couple of years ago as
there was a recall on cracked tanks, and mine cracked!. So no matter how
old the car, this is a good site to check for free parts :)

Sorry about the link, try this one:

http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/problems/recalls/recmmy1.cfm

then put in the year on the left box, (49 to 69 it appears) hit submit
next page pick volkswagen, then hit submit
next page select the only model choice (volkswagen) hit submit
next page, hit submit put nothing in the box.

then, after all that, voila this pops out:


NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number: 72V256000
 Component: VISUAL SYSTEMS:WINDSHIELD WIPER ARM
 Manufacturer: VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA,INC
 Year: 1963

 Model: VOLKSWAGEN

THE COULD CAUSE WIPER OPERATION TO CEASE ENTIRELY. 

 LOSS OF WIPER OPERATION WOULD IMPAIR ROAD VISIBILITYDURING INCLEMENT
WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT. 

 INSPECT AND REPLACE WITH NEW TYPE WIPER ARMS WHERE NECESSARY. 

SYSTEM: VISUAL SYSTEMS; WINDSHIELD WIPERS.
 

 VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: PASSENGER CARS; BK MODELS TYPE 1, TYPE 2, AND TYPE
3. 

take care,

Steve
