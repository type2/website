Im about to por-15 my engine  bay and underneath my bus and that means i'll
be dropping my motor for the first time.  I've got the bently so I'm fairly
confident but I do have a few questions.

Is there anything else I sould do while the engine is out?  I recall someone
mentioning re-torquing the engine which I'll attempt but what else?  Ive got
a new starter bushing so I think I'll try and replace the old one?

I think I may pull out my transaxle as well while I'm under there? That way
I can replace the boot, or what ever the thing is that is slowly dripping
transmission fluid?  It is the fragmented rubber deal the goes where the
shifter meets the transmission. Is there anything too difficult that I
should expect?

My transmission side covers are also slowly dripping oil I'd like to fix
that but I don't really want to take my reduction boxes apart - I was
thinking about just retorquing them but ...... I'd really like to stop the
dripping.  What is involved here?


TIA
