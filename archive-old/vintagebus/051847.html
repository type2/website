Subject: Bug Me Videos

Hey yous,
My son brought over a video he had ordered on rebuilding his engine. It
covered 40hp, 1500, and 1600, so I let him use my portable TV/VCR out in the
garage and rebuild his engine. After about two days he was done and it fired
right up. I supervised him putting it back in his 67 van and he drove off.
That was a month ago.

Last night he calls me and says his engine has running terrible for about a
week so I had him com back over. We pulled the engine and took it down and I
couldn't believe my eyes. Both of his heads were hammered with soot coming
out around the barrel. All of his head nuts were far too loose when we took
them off. I asked him what had happened. He swore up and down he torqed
everything to exactly what the video had said. I have a tendancy to doubt my
son from time to time in his hurry to get things done, but I gave him the
benifit of the doubt. I said, let's go watch that video again and check this
out.

Well, to say the least, I was shocked. The torqes given were far under what
I do, no wonder the heads came loose. They were using 18lbs for 10mm studs
and 15lbs for 8mm studs. I use 18lbs for 8mm and 23lbs for 10mm studs. None
of my engines have ever lost a head or had any kind of blow-by at those
torqes and have had natural lives. In fact, after the initial 500 mile
break-in, I pull the engine and retorqe the heads. Except for oil and
tune-ups, I never touch it after that.

I'm hoping that anyone else out there that owns this video takes some of the
information with a grain of salt. It's just one mans opinion, when in doubt,
use the service manual. My kid is in the video age, books aren't cool.
