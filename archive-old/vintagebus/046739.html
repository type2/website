a little stupid! Any help would be greatly appreciated! &gt;&gt;

&gt;From what Chuck describes I would suspect the slider for 3rd/4th
to be a bit worn.   If it is, then for the vintage of vehicle that we are
discussing, I wouldn't consider it unusual.  Financially inconvenient
maybe, but not unexpected for how old the gearbox is.

YMMV
