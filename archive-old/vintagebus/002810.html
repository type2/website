Renoir,  If you are speaking of the joint itself it will proly be loose if
it's been in use for a while.  When you get new CVs they are usually stiff
out of the box.  When you pull your CVs off for cleaning look for signs of
wear like pitting in the ball bearings, bluing * like what they do to gun
barrels*, gouges in the cages.  If they are not too bad you can just clean
them well re-grease * using the special CV grease* put the new boots on,
being sure to put the  keepers back on,  some locktite on the threads of the
bolts, torque to spec, and your done.  Oh yeah, Try wearing a white T-shirt
while your performing this work and keeping it clean and white., &lt;grin&gt;

BTW, Just a tip for you to keep it as clean as possible.  I usually take
both axles off , and wrap the ones that I am not working on with a plastic
bag to keep the grease and crud off my white T shirt to a minimum.

P.S.  Don't forget to check your Bowden tube.

Subject: [T2] CV's loose or tight


&gt; Renoir here,
&gt; waiting for my tranny via Ranchos and Bob in Encinitas, CA.
&gt;
&gt; So, CV's, which i am rebooting, should be loose within the assembly or
&gt; tight within the assembly?
&gt;
&gt; I have read both.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that loose, especially on the outside, would be accurate,
&gt; but i am not sure.
&gt;
&gt; thanks all.
&gt;
