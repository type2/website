For myself and all of the Colorado Bus Club members that attended the
BBB4  last weekend  I want to extend our thanks to Ronnie, John, Terry
and all of the rest of the Havasu Bus  members that put on the event.  We
all enjyed the entire weekend, all the good food,entertainmentand the
comradship.  That's what bussing is all about as far as I'm concerned.
			Regards to all
