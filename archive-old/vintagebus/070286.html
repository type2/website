&gt; Hi, I think your right with my ignition switch, I recently had to replace it 
&gt; with a little toggle switch, and maybe the switch isn't working all the 
&gt; way?  Its funny because sometimes it works and other times it doesnt. I 
&gt; need to find a 67 ignition switch and keys I suppose to fix the prob.
&gt; thanks again

Hi John,
Best to check the voltage drop or ohm resistance first then start replacing 
parts.  We knew of one VW Wabbit owner who had starter problems.  He replaced 
the starter, then the battery, followed by the alternator, only finally to 
fix it by replacing the faulty battery ground strap!  So in other words the 
ground strap cost him about $300.00 in new parts.
