Subject: re:[VB] Back from Mexico- Drove a 2000 VW Kombi!

I am pretty sure that I saw one of these busses here in texas. I didn't
know what it was, and most people I asked around here thought that it
was some sort of modification. I saw it from behind. It looked like a
late 70's bus but the roof looked kind of sqared off and it had a later
model vw symbol on it and when I looked at the front it had a vanagon
grill stuck in the front of it. I saw it here in dallas but it had
mexican licence plates on it. I saw it about a year ago and haven't seen
it since. I wish I had had time to check it out more closely.
