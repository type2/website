Subject: RE: [VB] Ride Height.

  The 70-79 T1 Bentley states the opposite, stating that they were marked L
and R (anyone ever did this to a bug to know what the hell they say?) This
is weird since they'd be  utilizing the same suspension priciple, even since
they are IRS instead. I have two loose bars as spares. The markings had no
consitancy between them and the set on my bus to indicate what which was
which side. If I ever need em, I'm just going to wing it unless I can learn
otherwise first.

Has anyone EVER snapped one? I hope not.

I think all we have is colors to pick, and angles to set.

&gt;Actually, the Bentley says the L/R orientation is irrelevant.
