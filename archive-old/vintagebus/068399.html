Hey everyone,

April will be here before we know it...and BYOB should be one of your first 
stops on the way to Kelley Park!

Here's the flyer: http://www.sv2s_dot_com/users/siliconvalleychapter/byob3flyer.jpg

And here's the big info...

Red Barn will be running the gates this year...meaning two things:

First, they're going to charge every vehicle that wants to park, camp, 
swap, whatever inside the gates $10.  All that money goes to Red Barn, we 
don't get a bit of it.

Second, since they're running the gates on Friday night and Saturday day, 
they will MOST LIKELY close the gates for Friday night camping by 
8PM.  We're trying to find a way to keep it open a little later, but plan 
on 8PM!!

On the up side, every bus inside the gates this year is eligible for an award!!

Email me will any and all questions you have!
-Taylor
