[...] please be aware the bentley may show the boots with the seam at 12
o'clock and sometimes horizontally. this was changed by vw in a service
bulletin somewhere way back when, or so i was led to believe by all the
old-timers at the shop i worked at.  the seam should be at either 10:30 or
1:30, depending on the side of the vehicle you are working on, (45 degrees
from horizontal) facing rearward (toward the engine).  this keeps the seam
from flexing open and potentially leaking. also, tighten the inner clamp
first, then while tightening the outer clamp, press/slide/keep inward
pressure on the boot as to preload the boot a bit to avoid it ripping
during upward extension of the axle tube.  i haven't had a problem with
rips/tears in many years, just boot deterioration problems, and with every
boot available.

&gt;  NatureNeed some help.  I noticed gear oil leaking after we got home from
&gt;  EveryBus.  Pulled the engine, it's leaking from the boots on either side
and
&gt;  the front shaft that leads up to the gear shift was wet with oil.  Need
some
&gt;  advice what to do from here.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; you need to replace those axle boots.get some new ones, and put them on
as 
&gt; directed in the Idiot book / Bentley.
