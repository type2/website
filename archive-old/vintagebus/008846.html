If copyright is the issue at hand, then we should try to find a free server

&gt; &gt; site guru's could prioritize or comment on?  Given some responses I need
to
&gt; &gt; be mindful of copywrited material so as not to attract the attention of
the
&gt; &gt; &quot;wolves&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; This is very, very important if the doc project isn't to be wiped up by
VWoA,
&gt; or Bentley, or VW-AG(!) lawyers.  The purpose as I stated when the project
&gt; was conceived is to make available documentation that is no longer in
print,
&gt; fairly difficult to find, and unlikely to see print in the future &lt;snip&gt;
