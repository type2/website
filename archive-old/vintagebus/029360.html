Subject: mid day break

hey all...
got a wild hair up my bottom today and decided to pull my motor and
replace the pushrod tubes/seals as they were making a nasty oil leak...
started at 2:30 and its about 4 and the motor is lying in my driveway
torn down almost ready to re-assemble...
hopefully will be done before dark tonight... too bad the days are
getting shorter...

thought i'd write a litle something about it just in case anyone
cares...

maybe i'll even write something up tonight...

have a good one guys/gals,
Isaiah
