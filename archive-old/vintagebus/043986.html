GL4...GL5...I bought 5 gallons of GL5 for under $20.  Some say use only
GL4 but the GL5 is a simple upgraded GL4.  It is manufactured to perform
better in the limited slip differentials.  I've logged more miles than I
can even guess and I have never EVER noticed anything to cause me to think
about changing.
