Subject: TGIF: Your &quot;Other Car&quot; Survey
Message-ID: &lt;3720BA2F.B59CC533_at_gmx_dot_de&gt;

Hi Volks,

I've been wondering about this for quite a while, so this
week I'm going to go through with it.  Please DO NOT POST
REPLIES TO THE LISTS, but reply to me via e-mail at
ermel_at_gmx_dot_de.

Replies are welcome from everyone, including those who
do not have other cars besides your buses.  I want to
gather data on how many listees drive their buses daily,
and what do those who don't drive them daily drive daily.
:-)  If you know other bus drivers, feel free to have
them answer the survey too -- the more data, the better.

1. a. What other car(s), make, model, and year, do you own
   beside your bus(es)?  And, for statistical purposes,
   b. What kind (body style and year) of bus(es) do you own?
   Please list only normally running cars (i.e., no projects
   nor parts cars) in both a. and b.
   c. Since I don't know most car models of the U.S., please
   rank your other car(s) on a scale from 0 (heap of junk)
   over 5 (average car no-one really notices conciously,
   or modestly nice classic that doesn't cause much envy)
   to 10 (brand new upper class model, or very nice high-end
   classic that regularly draws crowds) as percieved by the
   general public.  Feel free to add comments or a closer
   description.
2. Which of your vehicles is most driven
   a. in the summer season?
   b. in the winter season, if there is any where you live?
   c. Do they salt the roads in winter where you live?
3. If your enthusiasm for your bus scores a 10, how much
   would your enthusiasm for your other car(s) score on
   a 0..20 scale?  (0: I don't give a damn, 10: I love it
   as much as the Bus, 20: I don't give a damn about the
   bus... theoretical maximum value :-)  Feel free to
   add comments.
4. From a standpoint of reason, if you didn't have the
   money to keep both/all cars, which would you keep,
   the other car (if several, which one) or the bus
   (if several, which one)?  Feel free to add your
   reasoning.
5. Any Other Car you'd be willing to give up your bus
   for, or vice versa?  Feel free to add comments.
6. Any comments or criticism you'd like to add?

Sample answers from me:

1a. 1970 Bug Convertible, 1987 Golf GTI 16V.
1b. 1972 Panel Van.
1c. The Bug, 4 (it's sorta rough but it *is* a Convertible);
    the Golf, 5 (yes it's old, but it's quite nice, and it's a
    top-of-the-range model).
2a. The Bug.
2b. The Golf.
2c. Yes they do :-(
3. For the Bug, 8 (great fun but buses are cooler than that);
   for the Golf, 4 (at least it's a VW, and it drives well).
4. The bus.  Even if it meant I'd have to ride a bike and
   travel by train in winter, I could never bear to sell it.
5. I'd never give the bus up, but I could imagine to give
   up my other cars for a nice Vanagon Syncro Diesel Crewcab
   with a retrofitted TDI engine.  ;-)
6. Gonna build a daily driver bus, yadda yadda yadda.

TIA!  And again, DO NOT POST REPLIES TO THE LISTS!  I will
post a result digest next Friday.  If you wish to get the
result e-mailed to you directly, just say so.

I don't yet know which form the result will take, since
that largely depends on the number of replies.  If that
were less than ten, I'd not calculate the percentage
of &quot;Other Car&quot; makers, for instance.  :-)

Privacy Statement:

All replies will be used for statistical purposes only.
The results I will post and mail will not contain anybody's
personal data, like name or address.  If you wish your
comments (as opposed to vehicle data) not to appear in
the result, please say so.
I will not use your name or address for any purpose other
than replying to you, and I will not let anyone else have
them.

For the last time, DO NOT POST REPLIES TO THE LISTS!
Thank you.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
