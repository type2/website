Chris,

I don't have my Progressive Refinements book here at work with me, but 
backup lights and dual circuit brakes came later in the '67 model year.
Here are a few data points though:

'67 buses I have owned:   Mfg Date:         d/c brakes:   b/u lights:

Dormobile  237000874      July 5, 1966      no            no
Kombi      237001443      July 7, 1966      no            no
21-Window  247029266      Sept. 21, 1966    (???)         no
Std Micro  287116303      April 24, 1967    yes           yes

The earliest '67 in the NEATO registry is 2x7000597 July 5, 1966 and 
The latest '67 in the NEATO registry is 2x7146287 July 7, 1967.
