Subject: Re: [VB] I had to take the engine out (Neophyte update)

before you put the engine back in,have someone help
you check the tranny. by turning the input shaft by
hand(you can use the clutch disk as added leverage)
check to see that the wheel turns in all gears(you
will need to have someone hold one wheel stationary or
nothing will happen since it is an &quot;open differential&quot;
this should help determine  if it is a clutch problem
or in the transaxle itself..

&gt; First, Thanks to all who helped.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes the shift coupler was good and still wired into
&gt; place.
&gt; All four bolts were in holding the engine in place
&gt; and the tranny mounts
&gt; were all good and tight except for one broken bolt.
&gt; 
&gt; I removed the engine and found that two out of 3 of
&gt; the springs had come off
&gt; of their clips. Looked at the surface of the
&gt; throw-out bearing and looks
&gt; shiny and not scarred as well as the face that the
&gt; previously mention
&gt; bearing mates with on the pressure plate(?). Also
&gt; found a broken bolt on the
&gt; right rear tranny mount.
&gt; 
&gt; so the new question is would that broken bolt be the
&gt; root of the problem.
&gt; would that have created enough movement to cause
&gt; this to happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Am going to put together tommorrow after check
&gt; tranny level(when I can see
&gt; better)
&gt; and replacing broken bolt.
