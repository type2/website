Subject: Oktoberbus is next weekend

Hey now
Next weekend is the second weekend of Oktober and do you know what that means?

No, boys and girls, Mr Spanky the Monkey is NOT going to appear at Farmington 
Racetrack in the Mountain Dew drag bug race ve-hikkle.

But not all that far away is the somethingth or other annual campout known as 
Oktoberbus.  For those that don;t know, it's a bus campout where a whole 
bunch of us get together, camp for the weekend, eat Breakfast Burritos, and 
watch a couple of way-good people tie the knot.  We're expecting good 
weather, and a really special time with a wedding, maybe some cake, and Mike 
D'Angelo in a thong.  

Umm, maybe not that last one.  If you know Mike, you'd understand.  Really, 
he's a nice guy and all.... but I digress.

Mark it on your calendar, go buy the ice tomorrow so you'll have to go get 
more Friday or Thursday, but make sure you come to the campout or else you'll 
miss it.  Then you'll wish you hadn't and then you'll be all bummed out and 
then you'll go kick your dog or something so your dog'll be all bummed out 
too.  I don't want your dog to be all bummed out, so just come to the 
campout.  Bring your dog too!

Don't know how to get there?  That's easy!  Just follow the directions on the 
web page whose URL I hope I remember to put at the end of this e-mail.
