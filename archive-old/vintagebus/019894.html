&gt;Bob said:i went to a local NAPA and there 
&gt;it is... a whole 
&gt;shelf full. GL-4 by Sta-Lube

When I needed some, my local NAPA didn't have it on
hand and had to order it--I went in and ordered it
before 5pm and it was in the store the next morning.

So any NAPA (and maybe other FLAPS) should be able to
get what you need with no problem, just be sure to
check the specs in their supplier's catalog and make
sure it is just &quot;GL-4&quot;, and not &quot;GL-5&quot; or higher
numbers.
