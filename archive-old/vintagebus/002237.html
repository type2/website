As I reported earlier, my Bus broke down/wouldn't start on Thursday night.


I'll skip some huge description of a wasted Saturday of swapping parts on
and off in attempt to figure out the problem and how I would swap something
on, it would work for 5 minutes, then stop working, causing me to go nearly
insane.

It turned out that the wire from the ignition switch to the fuse box which
then directly goes to the coil was _really_ frayed at both ends as well as
the screw-on connector at the fuse box being dirty.  Cleaned the whole fuse
box up (although that was the only dirty connection), fixed the ends of the
ignition wire and I'm good to go!

So the moral is, if you read 2 or 4 volts at your coil (points closed) on a
6v system, you have a wiring problem...

Thanks,
