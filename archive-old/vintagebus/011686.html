&gt; ...As long as you're spending the money for a good set

Be very careful here!  I have a pair of 195-75R14LTs, load range C, on
my bus.  They aren't the correct tires.  My own fault, really, as I
had assumed (and been assured of the fact by the helpful tire guy)
that these tires were basically identical to the correct 185R14 size. 
They are _not!_

First off, the maximum load rating of a 195-75R14LT load range C tire
isn't sufficient for a bus.  They are rated at 1435 pounds, where a
bus needs a minimum of 1520 pounds.  They'll work OK on the front, but
I wouldn't put them on the back, particularly if it's a Westy.  

OTOH, a 185R14 load range C tire is good for 1650 pounds.  

Even a _standard_ load 185R14 tire will handle more load (1450 pounds)
than a 195-75R14 load range C light truck tire (1435 pounds)!

If you insist on running the 195-75R14s, be sure that you get load
range &quot;D&quot;.  Just to be sure, check the maximum load on the sidewall,
as the load ranges change depending upon the tire size.

I've covered other reasons to stick with 185R14s (diameter, steering
box, etc.) in other posts, so I won't repeat them here.

Another reason to use 185R14s is that continued availability of that
size depends upon sufficient sales to make manufacturing the tires
worthwhile.  Every time we substitute another tire for the 185R14 we
make it less attractive for the manufacturers to keep making it.  The
185R14 isn't any more expensive then the 195/75R14, either.  The last
ones I bought (in load range D) were $70, mounted and balanced, from a
Firestone/Bridgestone dealer.
