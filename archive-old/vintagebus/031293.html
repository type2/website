Subject: Re Porta Pottie

On May 7th --I had a hip replacement--and one of the things i had to buy was an elevated
seat above for the house toilet , that is adjustable in height, -because i was not allowed
to bend over too far---The 1st time Magoo and i saw it--we knew it would become a part of
our VW Bus Camping equipment--!! You do not even have to by new!! You can go to a store
that has used equipment for various people who need assistance at home--
crutches--canes--etc.  The raised potti seat comes with a &quot;Container&quot; that you just put
under the raised seat and inset a plastic bag----and Viola!! You have a porta potti!!!
The entire assembly also breaks down!! Medicare paid for ours!!  TWWM, uj
