Hi everyone,
I'm new to this list but not to having a vw around. I picked up a 57 single 
cab and I have a few items and questions about it. Does anyone on the list 
know where I can get the correct tail lights? The truck has suffered the 
indignities of having its turn signals changed to make it look &quot;new&quot; so I'll 
need to get some sheetmetal (enough of it to line the holes up correctly), 
the crank hole apron, and a front bumper in decent shape. Its in overall 
pretty good condition, not much rust, just a few spots on the gates/bed, and 
a slight bump on its nose. The rear quarter had the battery come loose and 
tear it open so it isn't drivable yet, but runs and sort of stops, but that 
is another project. Right now I want to find the pieces of sheetmetal so I 
can get the body to the shop and get it on the road. Anyone have any 
knowledge of things that are peculiar to that model year? And things that I 
should know about?  Any help would be greatfully appreciated. I live outside 
of Chicago, anyone else in my area?
                                                       
                                                                              
                       Steve
