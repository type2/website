Well, 

	You see in the natural evolultionary life of the split screen bus,
they constantly changed breeds of squirrels that run in the engines.  The
earlier breeds weren't picky and were fed small nuts housed in the
transmission housing (hence small nut.).  At some point (around 1963) a
hybrid breed was implemented, they found that they small nuts were no longer
enough to sustain the animals (hence the bastard breed saga) so the &quot;big
nut&quot; transmission was introduced, which fared nicely with those and future
evolutions.
