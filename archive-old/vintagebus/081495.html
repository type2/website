Subject: Upcoming Driving/Camping Trip Invite

To Whom it may Concern (Or not),

Michele and I are going to take our '66 Westy on a little driving/camping
trip on the following days:  13-16 May, 2005.  We are leaving our home in
Southern Humboldt County on Thursday night (the 12th), and heading north to
the Smith River area.  From Crescent City, we will take a road is called
Howland Hill Road (trailers not recommended), which will put us somewhere
near Hiouchi, and from there south (on South Fork Road) to an area called
Big Flat.  Probably will camp near Big Flat at some groovy environmental
sites (I think the road we are looking at is called Hurdeygurdey Creek
Road).  The next day (Friday the 13th), we head up this Hurdeygurdey Creek
Road, (#405), and follow it at length until we get up to Hwy 199, which is
on the Smith River.  From there, which is relatively near Gasquet, we will
take Old Stage Road, follow it all the way around its loop, and drop back
down to 199 again, and then take another loop (it's probably Sunday by now),
and do another southerly loop consisting of Jawbone Road to Ship Mountain
Road, and returning us to Big Flat.  From there, whatever, depending on the
amount of time we have left.  We return home on Monday the 16th.

Camping will consist of stopping the bus at some scenic spot and eating food
and whatnot.  Toilets will be scarce.  Running water will be found in the
creeks.  Fun will be had.  Bears might make an appearance, and humans will
be scarce.  We might find a morel (hopefully).  We might catch a fish
(doubtfully).  For the main part of the trip, besides the freeway to get
there, roads will be dirt and gravel.  With rocks intermittently placed in
the road.  Next to cliffs with awesome views.  Possible downed trees and
mudpits.

This will be a driving until you get where you find a place to spend the
last couple hours trip, not a get where you are going and sit around for
hours trip.  If that makes any sense.  Actually, it really is just an
adventure trip.

Anybody interested in joining us?  Sorta short notice, I'm sorry....it would
be nice to see you, and share the adventure.  We don't really expect anybody
to, but it would be nice!  If you want to only partake in part of it,
meeting places can be arranged, at least roads can be designated so that we
would meet up eventually, so no one has to be anywhere at a specific time,
and no one sits around waiting.

If you want to come for the first part, you can join us at our house...

Interested?
