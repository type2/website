Subject: RE: Tom Connor rack = good

well... while this topic is up in the air... i will DEFINATELY second that. 
Tom's racks are awesome. for someone that isnt looking for original, his are 
the way to go. there is a company that makes racks that look almost 
identical to a westy rack, but they cost what you would pay for one. i got a 
ladder too, and have gotten too many compliments to count about how good the 
combo looks. a few have asked if they are strong enough, as they look at the 
ladder... and i insist they climb up!
