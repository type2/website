Subject: Re: [VB] trailering a bus

Really a good point, here in KS, if ANY of the wheels are on the ground,
the vehicle must have tags (could be temporary) and insurance.


&gt;Howdy,
&gt;
&gt;On the subject of the tow dollies, beware.  I had one
&gt;reserved when in Tucson, and once we got there, they
&gt;asked for the license # of the vehicle being towed.
&gt;Since it was not currently registered and consequently
&gt;had no plates, they said it could not go on a dolly,
&gt;that it had to have all the wheels off of the ground.
&gt;So my only option was to go with the AT.  Thanks a
&gt;lot, Uhaul.
