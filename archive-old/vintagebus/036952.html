 Anyone out there have some ideas how we can find out about these?  Research
 possible compatibility with split-window bus front beam? &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
First what diameter link pins does it use?  Next what are the stamped part 
numbers on the various parts?  Lastly can anyone get that section of the 
parts book form Brazil (Should be the 400 section if they are still using the 
same parts manual system as earlier.) copied and sent up to be checked to the 
earlier parts books?  does this system use the small or large five lug 
pattern?   Eric&amp;Barb
