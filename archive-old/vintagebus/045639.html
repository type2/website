Hey all, I had the same problem for years with having to crawl under my DC to
start it.  I tried bebuilt starters one after the other.  Then I bought a new
Bosch starter.  In about 6 months the problem came back.  I was finally told
of a relay, made by Bosch, that would solve the problem.  The same FLAPS that
had been selling me all those starters, finally sold me the relay kit in
question for about $8 and the starting problem has been gone for over a year
and a half now!  I didn't keep the papers with the relay and don't know the
part number but could probably get it.  Anyone out there know off hand what
it is?   It came in 6 and 12 volts.

Later,

Jon
