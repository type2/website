&lt;&lt; The mirror arms don't want to move at all. The nuts are off both and I've

Hi Shawn,
Best to daily apply penetrating oil like WD-40 or Kroil (Which we hear is 
better.) on the hindges for three weeks.  Hopefully that will allow enough 
time for the oil to loosen the rust in there.  If they do not come out by 
hand then you will probably have to back off the nuts till they are even with 
the threaded end of the mirror arm shaft and tap with a hammer upward.  
Carefull not to mushroom the shaft which would just lock the arm in there.  
Last chance it to heat up the hindge to swell open the hole.  This of course 
ruins the paint on the hindge.  Eric&amp;Barb
