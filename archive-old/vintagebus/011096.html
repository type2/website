Subject: funny bus ebay auction
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here are some quotes &quot;I then was going to take it to the Pebble Beach or 
Barrett Jackson Auction, where similar VW Buses have recently sold for $30K 
to $35K. &quot; heres another one, &quot;It also has the original front and rear seats, 
which are very rare and difficult to find.&quot;. And here is a knee slapper &quot;All 
the floor boards are very clean and rust-free, which includes the bellypans 
and all the special 23-window reinforcements in the engine bay.&quot;, If I am 
ignorant to the fact that deluxes have special reinforcements in the engine 
compartment, then my apologies.   And if it is true, I wanna see a pic.
