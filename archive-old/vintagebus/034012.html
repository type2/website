&lt;&lt; There's always a first time for everything and today was one of those days,
 drove the church bus with it's new governed 1600 in it. Thought there was a
 problem because every time I would get to the shift marks on the speedo it
 felt like the engine was dying off, would shift gears and varoooom power
 again, would go to the shift mark on the speedo in the next gear and again
 felt like the engine was dying, shift gears and varooom off it'd go. So what
 it appears is that VW had there sh#t together when they put those governers
 on, defiantly can't over rev. Can't wait to get out on the highway to see
 how it does on the flats and uphill
  &gt;&gt;
...yup, that's how they work.  pretty wierd to drive till youre used to it, 
huh?
