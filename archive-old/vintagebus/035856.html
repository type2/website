Hi Volks, 
Yesterday while poking along in the afternoon traffic in the Auburn Valley, 
I made a slow lane change, 5mph at best, There came the &quot;Damnedest&quot;
racket from the right front wheel. It sounded like a can of marbles being 
ground up?
I wheeled off to the shoulder, couple hundred yards north of the15th St.
 exit. I thought I would pull the wheel &amp; take a look, I jacked it up &amp; spun 
the 
wheel nothing unusual, no grinding or wobble, did the 9-3 push pull, slight
movement nothing to be alarmed about.

Went to get the tool bag, Yep that sucker was sitting on the shop floor
where I left it Sunday after spending all day getting the vert ready to sell.

as for selling the vert that's a story in its self, best left for another 
forum:(

As I was thinking of whether to drive it on home or call AAA, a green 
84 westie stopped to offer assistance. Dan is one of those guys who sees
someone that needs help he stops to offer what ever is available.
He gave me his 6 m Allen that I needed to remove the wheel &amp; said good-bye
It was his son's birthday. Invited him to join the wetwesties camping group
He did say he is a type two &amp; vintagebus member, so if your out there dan 
thanks for the help, &amp; E-mail me I'll get the socket back to you.

Yea I drove it home with Karen trailing me just in case. Changed the bearings 
tonight, put off putting it together as the brakes need attention.

So much for rambling.
