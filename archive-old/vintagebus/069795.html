Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

If your bus had needed them VW would have put them there. That said, I
thinknthey are ugly, unless of course they are made out of cooking pans
in a Martha Stewart-like style!

I've got a big 10&quot; x10&quot; x 2&quot; oil cooler in there and the scoop helps to
force air through the cooler.
It has some utility if you need them.
