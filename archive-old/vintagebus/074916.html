Subject: Bus Bumper color

Howdy,

I have determined through research of the archives that my '66 Deluxe's
bumpers should be painted L82, Silver White.  My question is this, I bought
a can of L82 from WW just to see the color, it appears to be a much'darker'
white than the L680 Cummulus White of the top portion and interior of my
Bus.  Were all Bus bumpers painted L82?  And do most folks go with the L82
or with the white of the Bus?  Mostly just curious.

Thanks
Gary
