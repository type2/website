Even though I havn't posted much about it, I've found something that works 
REAL good and can be found at any local junkyard. Only problem is when I 
got it, I grabbed rubber off a few different vehicles and didn't pay 
attention to what they were. I can say that it all came off of mini-vans 
from the early to mid 90's. It cost me a whopping $5 for enough rubber to 
do 3 busses. I got 3 different kinds. The one I think would work best I 
can't use 'cause my safari's are already installed. If I would have had it 
when I installed them and accomodated for the thickness, it would have been 
absolutely best. But the stuff I used is almost exactly the same, just a 
slightly different profile.

One day I'll get some pictures up of this stuff. But yes, there is 
something that works with the aftermarket windows.
