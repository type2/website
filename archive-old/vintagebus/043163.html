I know that there are those who claim he's a &quot;goodguy&quot;, but I'm not so
sure he's up to doing his one man show for a large following.
He sells things on eBay he doesn't even have in stock on hand..if parts he
orders are backoredered...he will take forever to get back to you..
I have ordered stuff from him...bought stuff from him on eBay...and
because of the lack of service I won't again.
If I can help you at all Don... let me know in private.  I live very close
to him and can be at his house in less than 15 minutes.
John (veedubconnection) does quite a bit of business thru him as I
understand it and can usually get in touch with him easily.

&gt; Anybody know what happened to one of the *goodguys*
&gt; in VW parts, Wolfsden Imports in Poulsboro
&gt; Washington?
&gt; 
&gt; After many emails, I called their toll free number:
&gt; (888) 428-1797, and the business number: (360)
&gt; 598-4813, but both have been disconnected. I have an
&gt; order placed with them for some time now, but ...
&gt; 
&gt; Sure would like to know what happened to them, and
&gt; to my money, of course.
