Subject: joining the splitty club

Well, we finally did it, after 20+ years of owning bay windows, picked up
our first split this weekend. Its a 66 Sundial and it appears to be pretty
much complete and even correct. Supposedly even has a german rebuilt 1500
and still 6 volts. I'll have to have the german tag on the shroud
translated. Had a chance to see Karl and Harry as they pulled up as we we're
loading up, I dont think they thought it possible for there to be a bus in
Fresno they didnt know about. Thanks Harry for the towbar offer, it woulda
been a lot cheaper than the new improved U Haul rates (ouch) Pretty much
went as I thought at the border, its definately not the time to be crossing
and importing, 2 hours, 4 agents later we were back on our way. Three days,
2200 mi and two ferry crossings later, time for a nap.
