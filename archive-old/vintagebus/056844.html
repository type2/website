&gt; did this bus have a belly pan?

Hi J,
Welcome to the wonderfull world of spilt screens!  Split windows were those 
funny bugs made before ovals.  ;-)
If you mean a nose splash pan to keep the front to keep the front shift and 
pedal linkages clean, then yes.  If you mean the belly pans that double door 
and deluxes with sunroofs stiffening panels then probably not.  Unless it was 
special ordered and would still be welded to the bus.

&gt; did it have to have a rear view mirror?  (there are NO holes for one - mcode 
&gt; shows a US import tho.....
&gt; 
If no holes than no interior mirror.

&gt; elephant ear outside mirrors are NOT correct, right?
&gt; 
Depends on what you mean correct.  From the factory there would be one round 
driver side mirror.  At the dealership in the USA you could get Elephant ear 
mirrors as an accessory.
