Subject: Just a dream...

I've been occasionally hunting a supposed 23-window hiding in a 
garage somewhere in town.  Me and the family were driving down the 
road and I spotted a turqoise blue &amp; white bus in a shop/garage with 
a few other old cars. We rushed over and to my surprise it was not 
just a 23-window, but a double door 23-window! It was a walk-thru 
too. As I noticed that fact, I saw the dash. No way! I walked around 
and looked at the nose and saw that it was a barndoor. Sure enough, 
there were semaphores! This bus just kept magically getting better! 
Even though the metal from the passenger cargo doors, below the 
beltline and back to the corner was all gone (don't ask me why) I was 
just yelling at my wife how valuable and cool the bus was and WE HAD 
TO GET IT!!!!!!!!

Unfortunaly my yelling woke me up and I realized it was just a dream. Damn!

True story. Happened this morning. Now I'm back in reality looking at 
my engine parts in my shop.
