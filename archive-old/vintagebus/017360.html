Put your copper pipe in a bucket of cold water *ahead* of the new, bigger
trap that you're going to buy.

&gt; BTW, the compressor is running almost constantly with the sandblaster.
&gt; I hope that this monster is not too wimpy to power a spray gun!

Should hardly run at all while painting, even with HVLP.

&gt; I am assuming that a sandblaster is very air-hungry.

Yes.

&gt; Do I need to buy yet another water trap?  I am really getting poor, so
&gt; whatever I do, it's gotta be cheap!

Get a BIG water trap!  The one I have is aprox 18&quot; high by 5&quot; across.
Size does matter.
