Hey list, My buddy is needing some parts for his 55 SC. This truck is in
really nice shape, but everything 55 has been changed. We are in need of
bumpers, taillights, engine lid, apron and rear wheel wells. Please help,
these items are hard to find in Oklahoma! Also have 63SC that is complete
minus gates and engine that we would trade or sell outright. Thanks alot!
