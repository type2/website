 I just purchased another 1959 deluxe and am curios about the markings on the
 windshields. Both are marked in the upper inner corner with &quot;VER DELOG BUND&quot;
 inside an octagon with AS1 below the octagon. Anyone know if this is after
 market replacement glass or another OEM supplier to VW.
  &gt;&gt;

yes delog is one of the glass peoples- they made windsheilds for splitties.
