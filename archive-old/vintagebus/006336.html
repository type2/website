im still not sure why someone hasn't stepped up to the plate to make some
correct QUALITY hubcap clips made from titanium, or SOMETHING besides
tinfoil. When i did mine, i had to bend them back just so i could get
straight down on the rivet and then of course once you try to reshape
them......        I know many ppl  would pay extra if they knew they would
never have to replace them again. Surely there is a huge market for this
seeing how all models need them?
