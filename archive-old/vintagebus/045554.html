Was that a switch made when they did the roundy cornered speedo pods, and no 
switch hole for the pointy cornered speedo pods?  I believe it is an early 
truck thing to not have the switch hole.

&lt;&lt; as i brought up about a year ago, my 57 single cab doesnt even have the 
hole
 on the speedo pod for a switch or a plug.... what about yours kyle -does
 your 57 have a hole for a plug? Im still wondering if its an early truck
 thing.  If not, that would make my speedo pod ROTR or just a factory error
 :) .....        Everett? frankie? list? how was/is yours?
 
 
 
 &quot;Although anything was possible with VW, I think that you should have a
 plastic plug over that hole. It is similar to the plugs in the doorjambs
 over the hinge screws, except it is straight on one side like the hole. If
 the wire is there, or you want to pull one in, go ahead and hook it up. Use
 it however you wish. It may not be OG, but if you like it, it isn't hurting
 anything. If you have the straight-sided plug though, you will want to keep
 it. Haven't found those anywhere.&quot;

  I finally found one of the little switches that goes on the left side ofthe
 speedo pod for the interior light...
 My question is:  should there be one in a double cab?  If so, does one
 leavethe overhead light switch on and then turn it on and off by the pod
