Subject: Broken accelerator cable

My accelerator cable broke the other day. Bummer on the highway. I got home 
by jamming a rag into the carb linkage to force the rpm to run above idle. 
Fortunately I was only a few miles from home. I got home safely. And I don't 
recommend this for anyone to try at home. I though I might have to park the 
bus for weeks before I could find a cable at a decent price and it would be 
a pain in the rear to replace. After a quick search on line for how much 
places would charge, I called my local FLAPS and they had one in stock. I 
took my other non VW car there and pick it up that hour. They only charged 
something under $5!! I was feeling pretty good after that part. Anyway, back 
at the house I crawled under the bus, took the splash plate off and just 
pulled out the old one and pushed the new one into its place. I threaded the 
cable through a 2 ft. piece of old fabric fuel line where the cable passes 
close to the tranny to prevent rubbing. I smeared grease on the cable as I 
pushed it through the accelerator tube toward the rear. It hooked up right 
away. The length of the cable was just right. It only took few hours for the 
whole thing. The bottom line is the adventure ended up less painful, and 
more enjoyable than I anticipated. What a relief. I love these buses. Their 
so inexpensive to operate.
