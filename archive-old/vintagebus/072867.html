&gt; I've got one wide five 15&quot; steel bus rim.
&gt; I don't know the going price so I'm going to say $70.00 since I have to
&gt; remove the tire, pack it for shipping, and haul it to UPS
&gt; Weight abiut 27 pounds, Ship from Dallas TX 75220

That's exactly why there's some stuff I just won't bother selling on the 'net -
the effort to pack and ship it, and the shipping cost, far exceeds the value
of the item.
