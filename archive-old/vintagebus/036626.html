 As I was wrestling with an electrical problem this weekend (and losing -
 see my next missive), I decided to check the chassis number.  I found loads
 of info in the archives, except where to find it!
 
 Muir says to the right of the engine in the engine compartment.  Didn't see
 it - can somebody help me with a more specific location?
 
 Thanks

In I believe 65 they also came with a tag on the side of the overhead fresh
airvent- the right side.  THis has the VIN on it and a couple other things.
Or you could look at the M code tag benind the passenger seat on the bulkhead
(unless yours was hacked)

the wire running up through the left side forward of the L wheel well is for
the camper lights on the side of the bus over the table- it should have an in
line fuse in that wire.

I would check your wiring up front (under the speedo) to make sure it is all
hooked up right, and to check when it is getting power.  There is a wiring
diagram in the Bentley book for your bus, or Thom Fitzpatrick has it in colour
on his webpage. The diagram is the same 66 and 67 (only the voltage was
changed)  Wiring should be straightforward if things are origional colours.
Use a test lamp to see if things are getting power when they should.  Red
wires are always hot, black ones are hot with the ignition on, brown is ground
(if original)
