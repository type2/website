Subject: rex's dc project

i want to thank rex for inspiring me to work on my vw projects.

up until a little more than six months ago, i used to work a job 90 miles from home.  to keep myself from going crazy and to provide a better product, i rented a room in the town that i worked.  this town is quite a bit more up-scale than my home town so wrenching would not be looked upon kindly by the neighbors not to mention i did not want to jeopardize my situation with my landlady.  so wrenching was relegated to weekends when i was back home.

because i work very slowly anything that could not be completed in a weekend, anything beyond simple maintenance, had to be stretched out over a couple of weekends.  i was very glad that i had a choice of running vws for when the few times more involved wrenching was necessary.  anyway, in the 2 years and one month (but who's counting) that i worked this job i apparently got quite used to wrenching only on weekends.

it was when rex started posting is double cab progress reports and i started to wish i could do more with my vw projects that i realized that i could once again turn a wrench during the week.  duh, why was i waiting for the weekend?  rex, i thank you and so do my vws.

cheers,
