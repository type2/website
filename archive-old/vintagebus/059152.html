&gt; For a single port, it would seem like a relatively easy job to fabricate a
&gt; SP manifold to accommodate the 34 carburator.  I hate to see a single port
&gt; motor stuck with a dual-port manifold and the accompanying vacuum leaks at
&gt; the boots.

The reason for the dual port manifold is to get some better flow.  On a
stock or probably even 69X88 the stock SP manifold is probably adequate
but I'm thinking 74X88 would probably be pushing it.  The end pieces are
bigger than the stock SP so would flow better in theory.  The SP heads can
be opened up some and they have the same valve sizes as the dual port so
for a bigger engine this should be a good set-up in theory.
I've rarely had intake leaks on dual port intakes using the silicone one
piece boots and not overtightening.  Like I said Rarely.  Not never.:)
I think leaks were due to overtightening.  Good German clamps help too.
There is a VW mechanic running the DP/SP combination on a 1776 in a 71 bus
going through Tijeras canyon every day and he swears by it.  He also has
some oldtime single port adapters that work.  ANyway I'd like to try it if
anybody has some good adapters I'd buy some.
