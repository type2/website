not sure exactly what the issue with the horn wire is, but removing the 
steering wheel is not needed.  Anyway, there is only one way it can go on.  
but ignore it. go under the bus, loosen the two bolt in the botton of the 
SGBox that hold the horn wire, and feed it upwards.  Or pull it out, get some 
new  brown wire, and feed it up from the bottom of the SGBox.

&gt;  Thanks to Matt Roberds who sent me some technical drawings, I have idea
&gt;  where the key goes.
&gt;  
&gt;  I still don't have a clue what to do, so see if this makes sense.
&gt;  
&gt;  1. mark point of steering column on steering box in case woodward key is
&gt;  loose and not in a groove.
&gt;  2. I will undo the steering wheel nut, remove the steering wheel, and see
&gt;  what is underneath (I don't know). I am hoping to see something else to 
take
&gt;  off so I can fish the wire.
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyone know what the small metal cylinder is? Inside steering column on a
&gt;  1965 bus. (barbie doll beer can sized, sorry couln't think technical at 
this
&gt;  hour.)
&gt;  
&gt;  Any done this silly stunt? I am not sure what the woodard key is supposed 
to
&gt;  be holding. Rest assured, I will document this for the future generations!

&gt;  how bad it is. It is slower than a 28.8 dialup from three places around the
