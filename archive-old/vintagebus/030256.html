E &amp; B,
  I don't know about the tapered threads.  I'll go check.  When you say
retap, I only know how to use that filler stuff(apply non-stick coating
to  the sender and mix the paste and fill the whole with the sender
screwed in)  I'm sorry but I don't understand about the grease though,
or how to prevent the mixed paste goo from going inside the case.  Does
it stay there or will it work it's way(along with the metal shavings)
further into the hole and into the case?  What do I need the clearance
between the sender and the case for? Do you mean at least 1/16th of
&quot;fresh&quot; unstripped metal?  ( I realize there originally was a gap but
don't understand why it is needed now)  Thanks much for your reply,  JD

Hi JD,
Did your oil pressure switch have tapered threads?  Does the engine case 
appear to have had the same?  If so, then retap the threads. Make sure
to 
pack the flutes of the tap with thick grease to catch as much of the
metal 
chips and prevent these from getting to the bearings!  Then carefully
install 
your tapered threaded sender.  Does the sender bottom out on the case? 
If so 
you will need to file off enough case material to at least allow 1/16&quot;
space 
between the sender body and the engine case.
