I'll bet that it has more to do with driving a well-maintained bus!  :)

Just about every VW that I've stopped to help has been a maintainance
nightmare.  No engine seals, missing tin, missing heater tubes, rats-nest
wiring, etc.  I wouldn't leave the driveway with them, let along take
them hundreds of miles across the desert!
