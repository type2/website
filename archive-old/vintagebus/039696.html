I deleted the SC Bed Slats response from I believe William... so first of 
all, sorry and thanks for the answer.  Next, I will refill my coffee cup 
here and move onto Bus content!

So if the slats are hardwood which makes perfect sense and standard from the 
factory as everything seems to imply, does Oak makes sense?  I am wondering 
on the availability of Oak in Germany as opposed to some other types of 
Hardwoods.  Not trying to be difficult just curious.  Any German listees 
have thoughts on Hardwoods there?

If I pick up the SC here in town I will proceed on the use of Oak but if 
anyone has other thoughts post it up.  Thanks again!
