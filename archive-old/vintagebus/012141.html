&gt;Personally, the only reason I've ever converted to 12v is the practical
&gt;question of &quot;who can give me a jump if I'm at 6 volts?&quot; I've since 
learned
&gt;that there are some tricks that will allow this as well.

&gt;
&gt;Is there something that we 6-volksters should carry around to enable us 
to
&gt;accomplish this?
&gt; I've never thought of this issue before.

Like carry a spare 6v battery????


No seriously, even a almost dead battery, a 6v wired in series will 
allow 12v autos to jump start you. You probably thought I was giving you 
a bad time!!
