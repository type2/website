A couple of tips from the king of messing
up brake bleeding.  I've learned though.

Run the tight fitting clear tube from the bleed
nipple UP and over the tire.  This allows gravity
to assist in keeping the bubbles that like to 
hang around the nipple to go UP and hang in the
top of the tubing where it starts to come back down
to the bottle.  You don't need to bury the tube
end in fluid, as the fluid in the tube acts as
the resevoir to prevent sucking air back in.

Usually you get a small, and unseen, bubble right
at/inside the nipple that gets sucked back in and
remains there, since when the bubble is forced down
it floats back up unless the bubble is pushed all
the way to the bottle.  Running the tube up 
immediately solves that problem.

If you happen to have a spare brake fluid resevoir
cap, drill a small opening and thread in a garden
drip fitting threaded on one end, barb fitting on
the other, plumb to the pressure end of a Mity-Vac
or similar and you've got your own pressure bleeder.
Keep an eye on the fluid level.

Using the suction technique at the bleed end tends
to suck small bubbles in at the nipple.  Sounds so
neat tho.
