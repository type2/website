Excellent story... It is great to meet people who just like to relax and
talk about interesting stuff, better watch out though because you can burn a
day quick with some good BSing... Or should I say Busing :)

Rex writ:
&gt;I don't know what I'll be able to buy or whatever, but will post when I get
it. Should be fun. I talked to a relative about getting a loan to get stuff.
We'll see how it goes. &lt;

What is the rush?  I would just let it sit there and let the man teach you
all that you can absorb.   I am sure he would let you use the shop if you
needed work done on your car(s).

Hopefully you are not going to snag all the good loot and then turn around
and sell it for a million on gar-bay :)  LOL

Then again if he has that rag oval in the back collecting dust, buy it ASAP!
