Subject: Re: [VB] Belly Pan vs Pedal Pan

We're talking the same language here. I guess the nomenclature is wrong, I have
always known the &quot;pedal&quot; pan as the &quot;splash&quot; pan and I stand corrected I'm sure
if there were factory modified busses ie... any bus other than deluxe with a hole
in the roof or something else Volkwagen thought needed extra support I guess it
would probably require belly pans.

&gt; I think we're confusing &quot;belly pans&quot; which in &quot;list context&quot; (perl joke)
&gt; are the 3 panels used under the CARGO area of the bus.  I think our friend
&gt; was referring to *pedal* pans, which just go under the CAB of the bus.

&gt; &gt;Actually the front pan is a splash pan. Just for clarification Barndoors are
&gt; &gt;the only years that I know of that have factory splash pans. The belly pan is
&gt; &gt;for Deluxe and any type of double door bus throughout the split years.
&gt; &gt;You could make one but it doesn't need it.
