Subject: RE: [VB] restoring steering wheel

I have the pamphlet from Eastwood on restoring steering wheels and got their
epoxy.  I'm in the middle of restoring a banjo wheel for my 59 double cab
(http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/bjwheel.htm .  The pamphlet recommends
some very thick and filling primer and then a lacquer to finish.  I found
that I was able to finish the wheel well enough that I really didn't need
such a thick primer.  Accordingly I'll use a primer that is correct for the
black lacquer that I'll eventually use to finish it up with.

Good luck!

David

Hi List,
Does anyone know what kind of paint to use when restoring a steering wheel
and also is there a certain primer that is better to use than others??
