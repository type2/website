Also, there's a contest for the Biggest Bong, and they're trying to
set a record for the World's Largest Drum Circle.  The competition
starts _at_ 11:00pm in front of the Kelley Park gate.

&gt; this?  Where?  TIA  Also, what are some simple directions when coming from 
&gt; the North on I5?&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; YES, PARK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE.
&gt; MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR WOOD TO HAVE A CAMPFIRE.
&gt; THE LOCAL POLICELOVE WHEN YOU HAVE BAR-B-Q'S RIGHT OUT FORNT OF THE PLACE.
