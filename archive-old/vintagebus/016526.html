Subject: Splitty bus at LeMans

Hey everyone,

I've been saving this one up for a week, and since it's friday, here goes.

Last saturday I was over at my parent's house working on my bus.  I live in 
an apartment, and have no garage, and my dad was kind enough to let me park 
my bus in his extra garage during the summer.  I had rolled the bus out onto 
the driveway so I could do some grinding and not make a mess of the garage 
(ask me how I know)

My dad's next door neighbor, he was my scoutmaster back in the day, walks 
over and starts talking to me about my bus.  Turns out, he was a missionary 
for the mormon church (i'm mormon too) back in the early 60's in france, and 
they used busses to go between cities and transport missionaries, etc.   He 
told me a story that one time he and his companion were cruising into the 
city of LeMans.  For some reason, certain barricades were let down, and 
sections of the race track that are usually closed during non-race periods 
were open,  so they hopped on the track and did a lap or two in their 
splitty bus.  Got some weird looks from the locals, but they had a good 
time.

Anyway, happy friday everyone.
