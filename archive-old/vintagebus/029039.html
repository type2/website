Byran,

That sounds like the very common SO42 version of a Westfalia.  I'll bet he didn't
remove the tag on the overhead vent.  If it is a true Westfalia (so42) it will
have a 23- 42 on the top line of the plate.  The bus should have the remnants of
birch paneling on the roof (instead of a headliner) and cargo doors and drivers
side wall.  This coupled with the distinctive 5 window formation Id's it as a
factory Westfalia conversion (late 64-67) SO-42/44.  These Westfalias were based
on kombi busses.  You'll not find a heater (factory) outlet under the rear seat on
these busses like you would on  a standard.

Check out the SO brochure that Everett has on his site.  If your bus looks like
the pictures, that is what you have.
