The best budget rebuild out there ($495.00). I have been to there plant many
times and was quite impressed with how 10 different people assembly 1
engine, it's like an assembly line, all machine work was done in-house by
low pay, highly trained laborors (I think they were all related), Still have
at least 10 of there engines running out here in the Desert heat, but hard
to hurt a stock 1600. The problem now is that without S I R budget engines
the people who can't afford real quality will be stuck with G E X.

ronnie; can't say good or bad about S I R,15 years of dealing with them
without a problem that couldn't be resolved.

I got a phone call today that might be interesting to some of you,   S.I.R.
southwest import rebuilders (better known as crap rebuilders)  might be out
of business.  I did a warranty job for a customer a while ago and he never
got a refund check for the labor,  in follow up there phone number is
disconnected and one of there biggest retail pushers of crap (checker,
schucks, kragen) cant get ahold of anyone either.  maybe the vw community is
rid of them ??
