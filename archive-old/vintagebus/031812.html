The best cutters in the world are KNIPEX, made in Germany, these aren't
cheap but can cut through a clutch or e-brake cable like butter, these are
all I use and have for years, there selling demo is cutting a nickel in half
with 1 hand (on the tool), they also make slip lock pliers and other
assorted quality tools. Most of your tool trucks carry them (I found MATCO)
to have the best price. 

Just got through the list for the last few days
