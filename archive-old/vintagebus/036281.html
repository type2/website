&lt;&lt; my Local FLAPS has two clutch brands available.  Valejo and Sachs.  One is 
Brazilian and one is Mexican.  Valejo is the cheapest of the two.  He 
recomends Sachs saying it is made better but also said the Valejos is a brand 
also used in the Ford F-150 trucks.  He then said there are no German clutch 
discs available, not even in Europe.  I'm sure there are more than those two 
brands.  What brand clutch disc would anyone recomend I use? &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
We have been using the Sachs Brazilian nine spring 200mm pressure plate with 
same make 200mm clutch disc with sprung center.  So far in two buses over 
100,000+ miles on each without failure or need of replacement so far!
