&gt; Wolfsburg West just introduced the commercial line gray hubcaps, they

WW http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com wants $12.00 each.
I'll buy them one at a time (plus clips) as the old ones fly off.
Speaking of WW, I just got my fuel pump rebuild kits from them
and suggest you all do the same.
The soupy of correct pumps should be drying up 
(eg: our last go around of posts on this)
