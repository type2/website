Subject: Buses Nowhere Near the Arch #17 (URL)

I just wanted to let all of you know that for the past 2 days, the BNNTA
website for some reason has refused to come up for me.  I emailed Bill about
it and although he hasn't emailed me yet about any purported problems,  the
site is now up and running.  I hope that for anyone interested in attending
this year, that you'll check out the site and decide to go.  It's typically
hot there this time of year but for an all-bus event out here in the sticks
of the Midwest, we'll take it.
