Subject: Re: Oil System Upgrades

The 67 Resto from Hell has:
Dog Haus and shroud with all of the Hoover bits etc.,
Thermostat no matter what any one says,
Minor deep sump with the pick up welded in place,
Melling pump,
Berg oil pump over,
Case tapped in the galleys by the pump on the drivers' side with braided
line with as close to 1/2&quot; inside diameter as I could find. It might be
slightly less. 
(A/N rating is a relatively outdated sizing system~ 
at least what I had found in my research) I could stand corrected...

Lines run into a screw on type of filter holder with usually an HP-1 filter,
Lines run fwd to a 60 pass Mesa brand cooler with a manually switched fan
blowing down through it.

Also have oil temp and pressure guages as a general bench marks. 

For this bus it has all worked out very well.

The '63 that is my daily thumper is more of a stock config for an AH case.
Dog Haus only, no sump, or mondo pump. I admit to skipping the thermostat
and vanes on this motor but am thinking of putting all of those bits back in
place. 

I personally would duplicate the RFH's cooling system in a second &lt;for
Southern Arizona weather&gt; if given the oppty and budget. You probably should
start out with gradual changes. Skip all of the case tapping etc and invest
in some sort of guages and use them as general indication but not exact
readings. Watch your oil level and changes plus the other general maintenance.
