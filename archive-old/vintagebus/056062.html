Subject: Remove the engine???????????????

Hi All,

I've diagnosed my tipper electrical problems to a faulty generator. So, I
opened up the shop manual (the red and gray one since I have yet to locate
an original VW workshop manual that covers the 67) and the first line I read
is &quot;Remove Engine&quot;.

Is this true?  Last night, I started in on this project and quickly realized
after I had removed the carb, taken the bolts/nuts off of the intake
manifold, generator pedestal, etc that I still couldn't remove the
generator.  Maybe Muir is right in saying &quot;watch how it gets more difficult
as the years go by&quot;.

Thoughts?  Is this the straw that forces me to just pull the motor and
replace it with a correct 1500 h-case AR motor?



David
