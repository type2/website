Subject: Re: [VB] rear wheel cylinder failure

If the spring thingy that locks the star from spinning is missing, the shoe 
will de adjust, and yes the plunger could then over extend.   are the tabs that 
hold the stars in place present and working?  they are attached to the thing 
the stars slip into.

about a mile from my house this morning, I lost a rear wheel cylinder 
(passenger) on my 1967 Freedom Camper.

This is the third time that location cylinder has failed in 6,000 miles.
