the engine type E was an 1.3 l engine with 37 (german) HP and was built from
Aug/1/65 starting with No. E 0000001, ending Jul/31/1970 with E 0022000 so
maybe you have an AE type which is an 1.6 l, 48/50 HP (german again) built from
1970 to 1972

&gt; Hi all-
&gt;
&gt; I was studying an engine I had sitting in one corner of my basement for the
&gt; past few years, and starting thinking about what it had originally come out
&gt; of.  Though much research has been done, I still can't figure it out.  Any
&gt; help would be appreciated.  The engine code (found right below below the
&gt; carb) is E981053.  Thanks!
