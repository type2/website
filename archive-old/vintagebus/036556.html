just go to home depot and buy a heating element for an
electric hot water heater, or better yet buy a small electric hot water
heater
and instal a recirculating pump (also available at home depot) an low
and behold a hot water parts washer and you control the heat!

Thom,
there used to be a coffee heater that was made that could be used.  It
was a
solid heating element that came out of a handle, made a couple of loops
and
back into the handle.  The idea was that you plugged it into the wall,
stuck
it into the coffee cup and a few minutes later, had hotter than hot
coffee.  I
think the lawyers may have gotten them off of the market but I have
seen them
at garage sales.  Unfortunately for the parts washer, it might take all
night.

Another option is one of those heating elements that were used to start
bbq.
Its about the same shape, but about 10x larger.

I was recently at a surplus place and they had a whole section of
heating
elements that could be bent to the proper shape and immersed into
liquid.
Might be worth checking into if you have any of those places up there.

In ANY case, what ever method you decide upon, do not connect it up and
drop
into the tank without first going through a GFCI receptacle or circuit
breaker.  Your bus will thank me for enabling you to keep working on it
if the
element happens to liven up your parts tank.

GFCI == Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, used to be $150+, now $10 at
Home
Depot
