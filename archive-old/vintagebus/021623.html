well, this is what I did to my  6V 59 SC.  The problem was that when I had the
running lights on, the turn signals/brake lights were not very noticable.
The difference was not much.  Alone the brake light/turn signals were
noticable, but it may have something to do with the bulb holder design,
resistanct in wires, less than perfect wires/connection, etc etc.  yes they
were well grounded.

oh- so I though if I could add light I may get to security of having the
people behind knwoing what I was doing (safety safety).  I didn't really like
the idea of extra lights, and wanted them to at least look decent, not that
the beater truck as any trailer queen, but... you know.    I got some bug back
up lights, and attached them to the overriders on the rear bumper- on the
outside of the uprights.   I painted the clear lenses red with nail polish (in
lieu of buying two glass decklid type brake light lenses for bout $50 ea or
repro plastic red ones for $15 ea)   Installed wiring and bulbs and
individually grounded each bulb holder to the body.    The result was that
instead of one bright light, I had two dim ones.   Sorry, not good.    So I
disconnected the brake light/turn signal circuit on the original style
taillights, and that circuit runs solely to the lights on the bumper.  When I
had the jumper wire to the bulb holder direct from the battery the bulb was
much brighter  than when it went through the wiring circuit.   So there is
definately loss of juice there- whether the cause is old wires or funky
connections in the system, at this point I cannot tell.   

The bottom line is that now the lights are somewhat better, and I even think
the way I put the new lights on looks fairly decent.   And they won't be
mushed by dropping the Taillgate.
