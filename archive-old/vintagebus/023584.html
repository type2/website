Subject: &quot;another&quot; reproduction Safari window maker?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


 

Question for the group.  If someone were to look at reproducing the Safari 
windows, would it be more important to have them look 100% original or to 
make some that don't leak?  Please P-mail me, I'll post the findings to the 
list.

Thanks,
Dan Kinsey
