so, 800 spins per mile...at 3500 rpms and 4 to 5 miles per minute..50,000
miles to knock off .....10,000 minutes...divided by 60 gets you roughly
167 hours...then in days that'd be about 7....
No problem...secure the thing to your work bench...hook up the drill motor
and tape up the trigger and plug it in...
We'll all be sure to remind you next week at this same time to go back out
in the shop and turn it off.  :)
By the way...if you accidently go over 000000   it'll take a lot longer
than the 7 days to re-zero!
later

&gt; &gt; &gt;a tire with a 25&quot; diameter has about a 78 inch circumference, which is
&gt; &gt; &gt;about 6.5 feet, which is a fair bit more than 1/800th of a mile....so
&gt; &gt; &gt;you gotta spin it roughly 800 times to click over a mile.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I have seen elsewhere (not on VW) I am pretty sure the
&gt; &gt; speedo cable does not run that fast but has a much reduced rpm relative to
&gt; &gt; the tire rotation ...or not so on VW?
&gt;
&gt; No.  It is driven directly by the left front wheel dust cap.  as the wheel
&gt; turns one rev, the cable turns one rev.
