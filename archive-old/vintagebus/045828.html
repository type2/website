Does
 this sound right?   Nic &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete and Nick,
Thanks for the info guys.  We decided to open the Progressive Refinements
book.  Here below is what we found!

31 July 61  Chassi # 802 986  Sun Viser  Now: For front seat passenger.  

So it does sound like the passenger visor probably was a dealer or owner add
on.  Does anyone out there have some more official info on this?  Eric &amp; Barb
