Subject: Re: [VB] Cargo Door Latch Mechanism

Schei_e!  I've been *giving* them away _at_ $10!

What year bus?

I've dismantled and repaired one before, bit it's a major PITA.  I had
to drill out the rivets, then okie-engineer a setup to hold it together
again.

&gt; Has anyone ever dismantled a cargo door latch mechanism?  Mine is broken in
&gt; the fact that it does not hold the outer handle in the horizontal postion
&gt; anymore, now it sits at 45 degrees.
&gt; At 2 swapmeets that I have been to people wanted the equivalent of 45$ for one
&gt; of these, which I am not paying!  I am gonna keep my eye out for one at other
&gt; swaps, but am considering drilling out the rivets to see if I can fix it.
&gt; Worried though as if I dismantle it and can't get it back together I will have
&gt; to buy one at 45$... Hmmm decisions!!!
