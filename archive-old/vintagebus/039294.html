Subject: Spitting Plugs Story
Date: Fri, 28 Aug 1998 11:06:54 -0700

Way back when I had a '64 Walkthru 21,
one of the plugs was loose enough that
about every 2-3K, I needed to tighten the 
spark plug/insert to seat things properly.
Did it every valve adjustment, usually.

I was living in Seattle and a cousin was in Corvallis, 
and we arranged for a 3 day kayak
trip in eastern Oregon.  His girlfriend (now wife) 
had had a VW squareback
so he was familiar with them, but he had some
reservations about using my bus for such a 
long trip. We were going to where the towns
were few and far between.

Sure enough out in the middle of nowhere,
we heard a 'pow', power dropped and the
unmistakable sound of a spit plug.  I knew the 
sound, so was calm and collected, my cousin
exhibited the first signs of panic.

I just started to rummage around the dash tray.  
I found another insert and a spark plug and within 
10 minutes we were back on the road.  He was 
impressed.

At the next town, I stopped at the one and only
parts store/gas station/snack place.  Not only
did they have no spark plugs, but they had 
nothing for any Volkswagen or any import for
that matter.

Made it back without further VW mishaps.
The kayak trip was a blast, even though we left
the first night's dinner in the bus and had
to eat the camera beanbag.  I was using it to 
support the camera on rocks, instead of a tripod.

That plug/insert was still in the bus a few years 
later when I got the engine rebuilt.  Sold it soon
thereafter so don't know if it still had the insert in
it or not.
