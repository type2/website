greetings from yuma
had to replace the rear tires of my 65 double cab so
went to costco in el centro to have a look.
they have new LT195-75-14 in load range C . they
are a big improvement in handling over the sr-195-14s
that i had on.
have a bus motor that i torn down to rebuild and found
mahle pistons and cyl. they were  marked 85.94 .
the top ring groove is 1.75mm the second is 2mm and
the oil scrapper is 5mm. i cant find any here in yuma.
called berg and they don't stock them. any body out there have a set to
sell.    thanks
