Konichiwa,

Maybe this is a friday story...

The Truth:

I was cruizing down a rural road by my house, going 45,55????
I run tall tires so I don't know how fast, didn't feel fast.
I was busily eating peanuts not looking for the long- arm- of- the- law and
LIGHTS!!!! Flashing lights!
First thought, do I look like a thug, what does this guy want,  did he see
me in the post office on the wall???   Oh oh, yes that tail light has been
out for awhile now, but, he could not have seen that, I was accelerating...
  Well, I pulls over still wondering what's up.
Bufford approaches and says &quot;TOO SLOW, huh?&quot;
My sticker on the back says &quot;TOO SLOW TOO BAD&quot;
Yer going 60 buddy, you in a hurry?
Me says, &quot;I'm flattered I can go that fast, really?  No hurry sir.&quot;
&quot;Slow down and fix that tail light&quot; and off he goes, into the sunset...

Did he let me go because he has a loser son somewhere living in a bus and he
felt sorry for me?   WEIRD!

Had to get it off my chest
