Subject: Re: [VB] bus runs again (extra fuel tanks)

Last June, I left Albuquerque for the Classic weekend
with my logo'd doublecab that I'd just put together
and immediately discovered a horrible gas tank leak
that filled the cabin with fumes.

After driving with everything wide open, I burned up
enough gas that it wasn't quite so bad.  In Gallup, I
bought two six gallon gas cans (misnomer - actually
plastic) and some american fuel line.  I used a fuel
filter to connect German to American fuel lines, and
routed the line under the rear gate and in the vent. 
Worked great except that damned American hose floats
in gasoline.  I weighted it down when Ronnie gave me
an accelerator cable tube in Havasu.

This worked well enough to get me to LA and back to
Albuquerque, but I drove VERY carefully with all that
fuel in my bed.
