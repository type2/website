Subject: Re: [taillight seals]
Mime-Version: 1.0

my experience with tailight seals is that they were not glued in originally

there is a &quot;notch&quot; on the seals that i am familiar with that allows one half of the seal to fit on the outside of the body of the bus and the other half on the inside.. i.e. just a friction fit

dish soap will also assist getting the seal to slide in, but w/ new seals they should be nowehere near as brittle as the old sun baked ones that i have..
