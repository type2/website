Mechanically, it's fairly straight-forward.  Just be careful of the
internal wires going to the screw terminals.  The bearing is a press-
fit sort of thing.  The one thing *not* to do is toss the core into
the freezer to make it easier to get the bearing on.  I tried that
once.  It worked great, except that the varnish/insulation cracked and
stopped being an insulator.  Heat the bearing if you have to.  Or do
it right, and borrow time on a press.
