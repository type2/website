Is it possible to determine with the engine in, if I have a
thermostat/bracket and flaps in my doghouse shroud? I peered from the back
under the pass side 1 2 head and saw nothing. I am assuming it's not there,
but what about the flaps? Any way to spot that? I know that R and r is
bascially in order to replace these if missing (flaps), but first to tell if
I have them, next to acquire if I don't.
