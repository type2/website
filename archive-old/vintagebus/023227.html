What's your budget?  If you have the cash, have it professionally blasted
and primed, then lay on a filling primer, do you bodywork, and you're ready
to go.  A local with a '55 deluxe had his professionally blasted and shot
with PPG DP40, along with misc parts, for $1200.  That's what I'm going to
do with my '54.

Or, you can just sand and sand and sand.  Chemicals work fast, but it will
take a lot of time and luck to get them all neutralized.  I have avery sad
story from a guy on the Porsche list who had an early speedster dipped - it
literally ruined the car.

&gt;My Vw has been paint with Tremclad paint over what i can see the original
&gt;layer AND another layer of paint.  Now i want to redo a paint job...
&gt;
&gt;Ive heard i have to use a paint remover and scrape all the ol Tremclad paint
&gt;before sanding... is that true ??  and why ?? or the best way to achieve my
&gt;goal is tu Sandblast all old paint??
&gt;
