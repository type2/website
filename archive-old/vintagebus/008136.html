I can't say for sure, but I am almost positive there was no change. I bought
one on ebay a while back and I asked him because I think it came out of a
78, but he said there was no difference. I haven't tried installing it yet,
but it looks perfect. Hope this helps!

Subject: [VB] Westy Cot identification


&gt; I picked up a childs Westy cot somewhere in the past
&gt; and never used it because it was a Bay window model.
&gt; Tired of it hanging around the garage I put it up on
&gt; Ebay. I knew that Split and Bay cots are different,
&gt; but a interested party emailed me asking if it was for
&gt; a early Bay or a late Bay. Hell, I didn't know there
&gt; was a difference!
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully someone can help me to identify it. I
&gt; measured the length of the poles and they are 56 1/4
&gt; inches long. The poles are round and painted black.
&gt; The end pieces are welded on. The fabric is the khaki
&gt; canvas.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
