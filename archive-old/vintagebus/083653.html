Hi Seth,
We just align the oil pump to the studs and bolt in place.  The six mm  studs 
are NOT centered in the pump holes, but are slightly in toward dead center  
of the pump.  So installing 8 to 6 mm studs is not going to  work.
  Greatly helps to loosen all the bolts that are clamping the case  halves 
around the pump area, for both the removal and installation.  Once  bolted in 
place retorque the case half bolts.
