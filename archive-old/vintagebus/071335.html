Subject: RE: [VB] Re: 1965 Door Handles

Hello Everyone

	I learned a little bit today that if you need a key go find the
oldest locksmith in town and they will be able to help you out. I was
able to get two new keys from a master key book and keys that this
gentalmen had. He just looked at the number on the lock cut me a few
keys and every lock works (Sweet!) Thanks again to everyone that help me
out on this I will be able to lock all the doors and starter up with
only one key.



Thanks Again

	Is there a way to tell the tumblers apart. I have a 67 tumbler
and it takes a v78G key which is just a 1/4 inch longer and I have my
original 65 tumbler that has two slots at the end of it where the set
screw would go with no keys. But then I have a third type and it has one
slot where the set screw would go. This one allows me to put in a V2
type key in it. I need to find what type the 65 tumbler takes so I can
make the doors work together and then have an ignition key which I can
live with.


TIA
Eric




    Does anyone know where I can find a pair of 65 front door handles
with keys? I have a bus without any keys except the ignition and I want
to re-key the bus to the new door handles.
