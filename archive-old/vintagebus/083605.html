&gt; Bentley also mentions an extractor for changing the bushing with the
&gt; engine in place.  I have used a slide hammer that had two tiny hooks
&gt; you could screw onto the end to remove a bearing with a similar small ID
&gt; on a S_at_z_at_ki truckette and something like that might work.  The archives
&gt; also say you can thread a tap into it and when the tap bottoms out the
&gt; bushing will be pushed out... anybody know what size tap might be good
&gt; to try?
&gt; 

Hey Matt The bushing is 12.5mm or just under 1/2 inch  ID   All you have to 
do is tapp it and keep tapping after it bottoms out and the bushing will come 
right out. To install tape the bushing to a socket that just fits the out side 
edge of the bushing and using a long extension tap it into place lightly with 
a hammer . Be sure to put a little grease on the starter shaft when 
reinstalling it  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
