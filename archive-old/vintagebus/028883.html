Subject: 6306

Just got back from the bearing shop...
they fixed me up with a 6306 bearing...although it has the shields I've
to pop off....or should I just keep them on?  I'd say pop em off...as
the old one has its shields popped off.

As far as getting the old bearing off...I think I'm going to have to go
and get a bearing puller..
are there any other ways to get the bearing/collar off the axle so I can
get the other bearing out??

Thanks!

by the way...this is a 62 bus.  http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/62.htm
