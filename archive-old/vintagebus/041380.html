Kind of a rattle with some screech in it?  Friday I took some stuff up to
fix the taillights on my bus.  Got it done, everything good.  Started it
up and heard that &quot;C&quot; word.  Put the big screwdriver handle in my ear and
started listening and got the normal clickity clackity.  Shut it down and
suspected the fan.  Grabbed the pulley and was able to pull the shaft
in and out at least .010.  This fan is not very old either.  About 10
mo. old.  I would pull the engine, but the bug is on four jackstands in
front of the garage awaiting most brake parts.  Hopefully I'll get the bug
going this week after work, pull engine and trans on the bus Friday.  I
should have a new trans on the way so I can go over 53mph. Meanwhile I
drive the E350 with water cooling.
