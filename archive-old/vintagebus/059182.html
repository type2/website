&gt;A couple of the guys who own different VW shops here locally are also 
&gt;into street rods.  Must be some connection.

Well, you can buy an '02 Ford, that looks just like an '02 Chevy, that
looks just like an '02 Dodge, that looks just like an '02 Honda.  And
they all look just like 75% of the cars on the road.  Or you can cruise
in a '52 Barndoor, or a '55 Oval, or a '32 Ford, or a '57 Chevy, or
a '69 Dodge, all of which have style and class and _don't_ look like
everybody else's car. 

&gt;Myself, I'm de-emphasizing the bus stuff and spending more time (and 
&gt;money!) on racing the 911.  My first time trial is next Tuesday.

Yeah...for what it costs to buy one cylinder of NOS Stuttgart air,
you can buy a whole engine for a Bus!  :)  And the air gets expensive
fast, since you have to run it in the *engine* as well as the tires...

I think you should race the Porsche for a while until people get used
to seeing you in it.  Then put a hitch on it, tow the &quot;Westy&quot; trailer
to the track with the Porsche, and go out on the track in your Bus...
