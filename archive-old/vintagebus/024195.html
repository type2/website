Subject: Front suspension stuck

First off,
I must say that I regret missing both BBTA and Jerome during the first
year of bus ownership. Frodo the 65 Westy has come a long way in the
last 10 months after 25+ years of slumber but she was not quite up to
the journey. Maybe next year.
The biggest problem I have right now is with the front end suspension.
The bus drives and steers just fine. New shocks. The suspension just
doesn't move. The drivers side is up against the rubber stop and the
passenger side is about 3/4 inch off in the compressed direction. I have
pumped a lot of grease into the fittings. All of them have acceppted the
grease easily and following the advice of Mr Hoovers lately demised
sermons I pumped until I got clean grease. I have applied a reasonable
amount of downward pressure using a jack with the wheel suspended. I
have also driven it for several hundered VERY bumpy miles.I suspect that
if that doesn't break it free nothing will. What I'm looking for are
simple solutions that require no money and little work 8) Seriously now,
Is there any way to isolate what the hang up is without tearing the
front end completely apart and losing the use of the bus for weeks. My
Bently manual shows LOTS of tools I don't have in order to do most of
the work. That scares me. Can I take the torsion arms off the springs
without disassembling the entire front end. I figure that might be a way
to tell which end of the system is binding.
Help
