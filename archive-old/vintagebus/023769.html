well, for a little while anyways.

Hey y'all!  FInally got the Ark registered, parts hung again, interrior
back together.  Stuck the 
shiny new (non CT) plate on and with a humongous grin on my face eased
the clutch out and off we went.

Stopped to return movies to Blockbuster.  Chuffled to the gas station
for a tankful of fresh fuel.
Still grinning, we eased out of town and up one of my favorite riding
roads to check out the suspension
and get a feel for the snap your head back acceleration that busses
aren't noted for (mine isn't either).  Stopped at a store for some
bottled water (my well tastes pretty bad).  'Bout split my head grinning
she was running so well.  300 yards down the road from the store, sudden
stoppage of the engine.  Not quite sudden like ignitor failure, 
more like ran outta gas.  Funny, just filled up.  Fuel filter looked
reasonably clean, maybe a little mung, 
to be expected after a 5 year hiatus.  Replaced it just to be sure and
to cut it open to do a water test.

Hmmm.  No apparent water.  Just for fun, pull the snorkel off and use
the mirror to look in the carb whilst
pumping the throttle.  Hmmmmmmmm - no fuel a-squirting.  Carb rebuild
went well, really clean carb and fuel.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm - fuel pump?  Just replaced it, but that's what's
indicated.  I'll give it the squirt test into
a can Saturday (gotta toil for the man Firday).

Any thoughts?  Did I miss something?  WHen I mounted the pump, I noticed
the actuating rod DID protrude a 
fair amount.  I rolled the engine over the see if the rod was at 'TDC',
it was at 'BDC' and was almost a pain
while bolting in the new fuel pump.  My question: is there a spec for
how far the fuel pump rod should stick 
up at 'tdc' and 'bdc'? 

I saw a buncha posts lately about what to carry for spares.  I 
never really considered a fuel pump as a necessary carryable spare. 
Maybe mount &amp; wire up an electric for 
justincase, and replace the just replaced mechanical.  Be easy to plumb
even though I'm not a fan of rubber
fuel line.

AAA just paid for itself.

As always, any and all suggestions greatly appreciated.
