Subject: Road trips

I like the road trip storys as I take so many also. Last weekend drove
a little over 1353 miles from friday am to sunday afternoon. After
driving all day friday to southeastern Az. to look at camper bus, and
then driving all over the place following leads ( found 300 or more
bubble windows ) was in Seligman Az on old 66 coming home to LHC we
spot a rolled 67 kombi on a towtruck and do a U turn on the on ramp of
I40 and follow the towtruck. Get to the tow yard and the PO gets out
of the tow truck and says he just sold the bus to the driver for $25.00
and all he wants to do is get back to Southgate Calif. I go to the tow-
truck driver and ask if bus is for sale. Long story short he sells me
the bus for $125.00 and pockets a quick $100.00. He even had the signed
Calif title for the bus. Question: how many of us carry signed titles
of our buses with us? Who knows the whole story, all i know is the
67 is in my driveway and the super running 1600 motor is in the 67
deluxe I hope to sell at JEROME * this year. The rest is being parted 
out to 4 or 5 splites here in LHC. Just goes to show the wierd things
that can happen on a bus trip and only 200 miles from home. Why would
a guy sell his great running bus for $25.00? Even if flipped on the side
it still ran. Had to come at least 300 miles from L.A. Had nice tires
also, 4 or 5 gallons of gas in tank. The bus fired up first crank when
we got it to LHC. OH well all the better for whoever buys the deluxe
at JEROME. Enough or I will start rambling like VonBondo, only I don't
have a barn door story, or do I?. I am going to see if the guy with the
54 panel in the bottom of a swimming pool (EMPTY) is out of jail yet
this weekend. Will at least get pictures so Everett can post on he great
website. Have a good one and remember TRAILORS ARE FOR BOATS.
