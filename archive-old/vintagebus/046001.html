&gt;  thanks again clara,
&gt;  
&gt;  I pulled it apart, but that bearing was frozen on.
&gt;  
&gt;  I had a spare with fan attached, installed it, but it was the wrong size,
&gt;  about 1/2&quot; to long :(
&gt;  
&gt;  Bought a rebuilt.
&gt;  
&gt;  QUESTION?
&gt;  On the fan end, order of parts?
&gt;  
&gt;  1. Plates attached with small nuts.
&gt;  2. Slotted piece, where the woodruff key is.-
ya- I forget what that thing is called right now too.

&gt;  3. Shims, how many?

3.5 lets put a fan in here too.

&gt;  4. Slotted locknut.
not sure what that is
&gt;  5. Shims?
&gt;  6. Final large 36mm nut.
&gt;  
&gt;  I have looked for diagrams for specifics with no luck so far.
&gt;  
&gt;  thanks
&gt;  

look in a bentley.  the 68-79 bus bently has exploded pics, and tells about 
shims- the amount of shims can vary to get the right size gap.
