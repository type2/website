&lt;&lt; I'm hesitant to disagree with folks such as you that have so much 
knowledge on
 vw's - and I might be wrong - but isn't what happens when a generator is 
reverse-polarized is that it fries the contacts in the regulator, like real 
fast?  (It happened to me..)&gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Well go ahead and disagree!  No one knows all, or even most of all! &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;If the generator is putting out a current at all from the beginning, that, 
by default, means that it is properly polarized just because the &quot;iron 
magnets&quot; in there are orientated correctly and the &quot;copper loops&quot; are cutting 
the magnetic field in the proper direction, thus producing the positive out 
of D+.  Now, this I'm not certain about, but I think the red light would show 
if the thing was running reverse-polarized.  My suggestion is that your 
generator ran 15 minutes to two hours before it burned out was because of 
another problem, not polarization. &gt;&gt;
  Interesting to hear about the reverse polarization problem.  When we burned 
up two generators one, after another we were not running voltage, or amperage 
gauges.  Just the idiot generator light, that went out after installing each. 
 Apon polarizing the third the generator did not burn out, and we never have 
the same problem since we always polarize each new/used unit we install for 
the last 19 years.  From what we understand is that if the generator sits 
around long enough the iron magnets loose thier strength, and the generator 
will run somewhat, but soon will over heat from not working properly, and 
burn the insulation.  Maybe someone else with more physics knowledge could 
explain it better.  What we do know is that Bosch the ignition parts supplier 
of not only almost every year of VW since WW2, but many, many other 
automakers vehicals from the factory all over the world insist on 
instructions to polarize thier generators.   Eric&amp;Barb
