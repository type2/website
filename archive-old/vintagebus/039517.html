NQ,

Hello from Florida....Im very much enjoying seeing all the pictures you are 
taking. Sure looks like ya'll are having one hell of a VW good time. Its 
kinda strange to see where the show is being held because our shows are 
always on black asphalt parking lots or in a park with lots of trees. Kinda 
looks like some kind of tent city with all those buses lined up and the 
white lines on the ground. I guess it could be called BUS CITY. Would be 
cool to get on a tall cherry picker or get the fire dept out there with a 
tall ladder truck so you can take a picture from high above.

Keep them coming !!! I wonder if there is any way to hook up a web came and 
have 24hour a day shot of the activities. Now that would be COOL !

David
