Subject: Re: [VB] 4th Annual Mt. Shasta Snow Trip Report

----- Original Message -----
From: &quot;Gene Cornelius&quot; &lt;mizamook_at_starband_dot_net&gt;

&gt; I'm pleased to announce that the 4th Shasta Trip was a success, and while
&gt; all participants are not yet home safe, the trip itself saw no broken buses,
&gt; no serious injuries, and many a tale to be told (later).

shasta snow trip is like a roller coaster in at least two ways:
the trip is an exhilarating ride that ends late sunday night or monday morning in a pit of exhaustion.
the roads we travel are all pretty much either up or down and for the most part we go fast.

during the trip i either was freezing in the snow, freezing in the rain, getting gassed by my truck's most excellent if toxic smelling heat or experiencing physical pain from total lack of sleep.  i also had an absolute blast and feel truly sorry the trip is over!

i left monterey early evening thursday with my truck's odometer reading at 44910.  i returned to monterey late afternoon monday with my truck's odometer reading at 46009.  during the 1100 miles my truck proved itself an awesome machine of endurance, strength and agility.  my driving skills were proved either better than average or governed by a complete lack of sense and reason... depending on how one might look at the situation.

the shasta snow trip group mainly drove back roads beginning in guerneville (n.w. of s.f. about two hours) to mt. shasta (s. of the oregon border by about 30 minutes) then mt. shasta to lakeport  (s.w. of s.f. about three hours).  the first part of the trip beginning friday morning dark was about 18 hours long.  i didn't keep track of where we were driving and mostly just followed the vehicle in front of me trying not to crash into anything.

for those who have sturdy buses and are hardy and adventurous, to whom the allure of adventure off the grid appeals, those who enjoy driving their buses, the activities of winter snow and who enjoy the company of other bus pilots then shasta snow trip wants you to experience its awe inspiring majesty!

my truck is the bringing up the rear in the picture titled &quot;to the hills.&quot;  my truck is probably winding out third gear meaning that we're doing about 40 or 45 mph along that twisty dirt road!  worse is that richard took the picture while driving!

cheers,
