&gt; I've never seen a solid-state flasher &quot;relay&quot;.  I would expect that to
&gt; be the case with such a beast, however.  Brand name?  Part number?
&gt; Vendors known to carry them?  Anything along those lines would be

Well,

When i was at Advance Auto Parts, in their flasher section they had both
solid state and old school flasher relays, 2 and 3 terminal. I used a 2
terminal model on my 61, but i dont have emergency flashers so take that
FWIW.

The solid state ones were maybe $1 or $2 extra, and dont make that cool
click-click sound so i bought the mechanical one, but if i can get better
taillights by using a solid state one i will.

Non solid state are usually a round aluminum can looking thing, solid
state are usually square and made of black plastic.

You can even get musical ones i think, maybe i'll get one that plays dixie
while i have my signals on ;)

take care,

Steve
