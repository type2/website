&lt;&lt; On second look, I think it's a standard.  It just doesn't
 have the pop-outs for the 2 door or opposite windows, but
 it does have middle and rear seats, unlike a combi.
 
 I can't find a way to get behind the front seat, as the base
 of the back just won't come up.  Oh yeah, I don't have a VIN
 on paperwork, as there wasn't any paperwork. &gt;&gt;
.
with a 66 ?   you can look for the VIN on the right side of the fresh air 
vent on the aluminium tag there.  or pull the pass seat forward (at the top, 
the whole thing tips forward) and look for the M code tag there.  Or look on 
the right on the level near the battery in the engine compartment, the vin is 
stamped there.

from 65 on the vin should be 2xx xxx xxx, with teh second digit the model and 
the third digit the last digit of YOM, so VIN 226 xxx xxx would be for a '66 
standard.

Can you get a good title w/o papers in your state.  are your sure this is no 
shady deal?  

also, combis can come with front, middle, rear  seats.    6 pop outs was an 
option, that not all buses came with.   if it came with a headliner, it is a 
passenger bus (standard, type22) w/o  and the back painte grey not colur of 
cab, then it is a combi, (type 23.)
