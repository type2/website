Yeah, those digital things suck!   Just because you can choose the
quality level (which never deteriorates ), instantly send them to people
all over the world, let thousands of people all over the world look at
them at the same time,  insert them in to any printable document, print
out only the ones you want, save money on wasted film stock, processing
and paper, free up large tracts of closet space where you used to store
all those pictures and save your friends and relatives the horror of old
fashioned slide shows, means nothing.

Yeah, those things SUCK ;-)

BTW I own both kinds.....

&gt; Why do people buy digital cameras???? If you bought a
&gt; real camera you would have photos of the event around
&gt; for years, but with digital its as good as history,
&gt; what you gonna do, store it on a disc?
