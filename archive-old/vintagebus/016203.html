This is to those who have shown interest in my '65 DC

   Thanks for all the interest everyone.  I am in the
process right now of graduation (Associate of the
Arts), moving back home from school and stuff and am
hoping to get some pictures taken and posted soon or
email them to the individual respondants.  So, hang
tight.
    The pictures I saw when I bought him are on VW
Planet in the pictures, not gallery, section on page 6
of the double cabs.  My name is under him, sorta
bluish with dark nose.  He looks a bit better now with
silver freckles (POR-15) instead of rust.

    The DC does *not* drive, however, I believe it
would not take too much to make it so.  I couldn't
figure out what was wrong with the shifter in the week
I had to get him running.  The bug 1500 he has does
run like a top though.  The only thing that I can tell
that prevents it is the shifter stuff I didn't have
time to tear into.  Thanks again for all your
interest, I hope to be getting some pictures up and
around inside a week.  

Thanks,
Benj. Clark
