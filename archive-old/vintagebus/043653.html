&gt;I found an electrical device mounted on the frame of my '66 near the
&gt;starter...it has three heavy wires (snipped off), a square front plate with
&gt;a round body, and the only clue is that &quot;6V&quot; is stamped in the bottom....

Sounds like a 6 volt Ford starter relay - probably used as an ignition
switch bypass.  I have seen these relays in two basic configurations -
the one you describe, with a square metal base plate and a cylindrical
body perpendicular to the mounting surface, and another with an L-bracket
mounting and a cylindrical body parallel to the mounting surface.  Later
Muir books have a sketch of one in the back.

Yours probably has two big studs with nuts about 180 degrees apart and
one or two smaller studs with nuts, halfway between the two big ones.
If that sounds like yours, that's probably what you have.  The two
big studs are the contacts, the little stud that has the wire on it
is one side of the coil, and the coil grounds through the mounting
bracket.

There's nothing in your '66 that it could replace, but you might stash
it in the spares bin if you have any other 6v VWs that use a standard-ish
relay (hazard lights on '65 and down Buses, Ghia with dual horn relay,
etc.)  It's not &quot;correct&quot; but it might keep you going on the road.
