Subject: Re: [VB] dumb question: is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to lower , 
  compression?

Hi All -

What  problems? There are a LOT of high compression guys running copper head
gaskets to improve sealing between the head and  cylinder.

Hi Eric,
Any time you increase the number of sealing seams one increases the chance
of failure.  Most of the ones we have seen were made  of aluminum.  We do
wonder how much the copper deforms.  Having  found one engine with pure copper
instead of the copper plated steel  washers used on the sump plate.  The pure
copper washers got a lot thinner  and spread out so much as to lock onto the 
sump studs.

====================

I'm with Eric.

I've just had the chance to inspect a set of .060 copper head gaskets after a 
robust 10,000 miles on a rebuilt dual spring head (that broke on a trip into 
work, but another story).  After examination, and a brief scrubbing with 300 
wet&amp;dry, we would have no qualms about reusing them again.  There was very 
slight deformation on a couple of them - not enough to catch a fingernail.

No signs of any leakage from an examination of the head and cylinder sealing 
surfaces.  These came from Competition Engineering at $60, but I suspect that 
any of our reputable vendors' offerings would work ok.

Originally, we also had .090 shims between the cylinders and the case - to get 
down to 6.8:1 CR.  Needing new heads, we got a set of 40X35.5's from Old Volks 
and did a mild port&amp;polish.  With these we decided to up the CR to 8:1 by not 
using the copper shims, but they are on my shelf marked good.
