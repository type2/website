&lt;&lt; I have installed a
 complete set of panels in a camper bus, double cab, and single cab, and
 all three when exposed to any moister warped.  When the days got a
 little warmer they would straighten a little.  When first installed,
 they all looked great, nice and flat.  My feeling is that the panels are
 not as thick as the originals but I have never compared them.  Has
 anyone else experienced this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Originally Vw installed a vapor barrier made of a waxy paper on the door side
of the front door panels to keep moisture from attacking them.  They did the
same to the type 1s also and later went to a plastic barrier in both type1s
and 2s.  Best thing to do is to make yourself plastic to go on the door before
the panels and make sure that the bottoms of this plastic drops into the door
bottom to direct water into there and not into your VW.    Eric &amp; Barb
