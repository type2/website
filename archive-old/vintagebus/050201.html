Subject: Getting to Engine follow-up...

I just adjusted the valves. The number 3 exhaust was tight. The .004 feeler
wouldn't go. I adjusted it and started up the engine. It didn't SEEM to
knock at first. But when I got on the gas, it came back. First as I let up
and then stayed all the time. I took the belt off and it made no
difference. So.....

Guess I'm gonna be pulling the engine, unless anyone has any ideas. Damn! I
thought I was in the clear on this engine. At least for a little while.
Figures. Supposedly this engine was a rebuild when I got it. I don't know
about that for sure though. You know how that goes. Well, I'll be looking
for LOTS of help. Thanks for the help so far. Don't be shy, keep it coming!
