Subject: Engine locked up -- PROBLEM SOLVED!!!

Hey Volks

I just pulled the mysteriously seized engine from my 75
Fleetline panelvan. As soon as I pulled the engine back, a
little washer-type thingy fell out of the bellhousing.

I got the engine on the ground and it turned over easily.

Closer inspection showed that the washer thingy was actually
a single coil from one of the cushioning springs in the
clutch plate, which had somehow broken off and jammed
between the flywheel and the bellhousing.

Looks like I got off lightly. Just need to replace the
clutch plate and we'll be back on the road again.

I have to go to work now, so I'll reinstall the engine
tomorrow morning.

Many thanks to the volks who responded with suggestions.
