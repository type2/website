*****Drop them into a can of Hydro Seal---and rinse them off---*****


What is Hydoseal and how long do you have to soak the parts? Where can you 
get it? I have heard of soaking and cleaning bolts, washers, &quot;nuts&quot;, etc. I 
just googled Hydro Seal and the first thing I saw was:

adult hydroseal. ... I have hydroseal in one of my testicles - I'm concerned
what treatment my consist of - - will I have to lose my testicle?

LOL Hey Terry have you ever checked out the MSDS on this stuff.
