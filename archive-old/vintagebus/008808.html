Ok. Right now I'm about to go check the generator, but just so this can be
answered and read later, I'll post it now, incase my generator tinkering is
for naught. Today, the bus wouldn't stay running once I let the clutch pedal
up after starting it. It has had the same gas in it since October, and there
is about a 1/4 tank left. I would like to get it out but siphoning does not
sound pleasant, so unless theres a better way I'm going to just burn it up
in the driveway. It doesn't seem to be getting gas or hitting on all four,
but I didn't have time to really mess around with it. It ran fine not too
long ago, as I started it once a week or so for a while, and I used it in
December to move. Now its backfiring, the red light is on, and its running
generally like crap. Any ideas? Thanks.
