Hey folks...


After an unexpected, but not unwelcome, 'vacation' from work two weeks
ago, I decided that I would be able to attend the Peach State Transporters
campout down in Titusville Florida, and check out the shuttle launch.  I'd
never seen one live...

Started working on the bus last sunday, working out various bugs that had
started showing up a few weeks after DoW..  tracked down the funky
miss...turned out to be the nearly-new bosch coil.  Yay.  Runs much better
now.;)

Left savannah about 7.30pm Wendsday and took the roundabout route...across
georgia down to I75, and waited at the Fl welcome center for the carabus
coming down from Atlanta...we were scheduled to meet at midnight.  The
drive was a a bit chilly, but all bets were on it warming up the next day
and staying that way the whole weekend...arrived at the Center at 11.30,
crawled in the back and read for a while.  Didnt nap much..something about
being in a Florida rest area in the middle of the night...though there was
a St Patrol hanging around.

The carabus arrived right on time, 20 minutes after 12.  Apparently Andrew
had lost his front tranny mount on the way out of Atlanta, so he rode on
with Dave E..

We spun on down I75 to Lake City (?) where we walmarted for the night.
Added another bus in the morning.

The ride across to titusville was occasionally interesting...the new bus
that got added was /slow/.....when Rob and I were behind her she kept
dropping down to 45 and 50...on I75 in florida!!  That aint safe. I hung
back even after rob pulled up next to her and she waved him on...when the
last bus in the carabus was only barely visibe though traffic, I pulled up
next to her...she just waved me on as well.  I wasnt going to volunteer to
take the rear-ending that comes with 45mph in a 70mph zone... I slid up to
70 and soon caught the carabus.

We all pulled over at a rest area with hopes to wait for the slow-bus and
talk to her, see if there wa a problem, etc etc...she blew riht on past
the rest area though.  She did pull over and stop at the exit ramp...so we
quickly piled in and started the run to the end of the ramp.  About the
time we started moving, she took off like a rocket.  Dave E took off in
the 60 to chase her down, since he was the first one moving...by that time
we had decided that we had a schedule to keep, since we did NOT want to
miss the launch. (and none of us was quite sure what time it was, so we
wanted to be early!:)  If she had a problem she needed to make it known to
us instead of waving us on.

We /finally/ caught up to them about 20 minutes later..Later Dave said
he'd had to run full out to catch her.....apparently she COULD move faster
as she was going over 60 when he caught her!!  As we came up to them, she
slowed right back down....we dawdled a bit, dave had already tried to get
her to pull over to talk to her....then we pressed on.  Dave decided to
hang back.

Its an interesting trick to hold a carabus together running toll roads...a
good half dozen toll gates..fun fun.

Then about..er..exactly..24 miles from the campground, beth and chris
started spewing steam from their 85 'goner...whoops.  turned out that the
water pump blew a seal or three.  Water goes on...water comes out.

A few minutes later, Dave shows up...the slow-bus had pulled off and told
him to go on...another ten or so minutes and the slow-bus shows as well.

Anyway.  we all took off to the campground, chatted with the extremely
friendly (heh) camp-keeper..and watched the launch. way cool.  now I def.
wanna catch a night launch.  After that, a few kids were tossing a
football around...and got it caught in a palm tree.  then they got a pair
and a half of shoes ALSO stuck in the tree trying to get the ball..when
they DID get the ball down, they threw it BACK to try and get the
shoes...lol.  very very amusing.

After that we hung out and bsed a while..Oh. Bill, Janet, and Mel from NM
were there..Dan Kinsey showed up at some point..I had a headache and
crashed out early..around 7 or so.  I was VERY RUDELY awaken the next
morning by a squirrel falling on the roof of the bus from a rather tall
tree....yikes!

I headed north about 10.30am with the intention to just be lame and take
the interstates the whole way...to much time in the seat of the Quantum
did that to me, i suppose...afte many many complete-stops on 95 to Jax,
and then to Savannah, I gave up.  Decided to wiggle my way up through
SC...was going to stop at the SC welcome center and let the engine cool,
check the oil to see how the oil leak was doing, and take a nap.  But that
was put on hold...the center was closed to trucks..and FULL of cars.
we're talking parking on the interstate offramp!!  So i moved on to the
intended exit, got gas, and crashed in a burger king lot.  Layed out for
an hour.  Still only half a quart low...which is exactly where it was when
I left home, as well as when i left titusville...added the half quart
anyway.

wiggled up 321 to 601 to 1 to rockingham nc, then rode 220 up just south
of greensboro.  Then I tried to work my way across backroads between 220
and 421, or better yet, find a way from 220 directly to the campground..no
go. took about 30 minutes to get to 421, then a few miles back south, and
a few turns later and I was there.  Right about 11.45pm

Another successful campout... I was bus number 96 to roll in!!!  Everyone
was there except for the Georgia and Florida folk to went to Jax instead..

Final bus count for the weekend was 121 buses!!  Well over 400
people...WOW.

I'll let the others tell all the cool stories..I was busy being beaten
black and blue by a quarter dozen little girls. Oops.  But when the broke
out the makeup..well..they didnt like it when I retaliated with a wee bit
of fresh axle grease..:)  Lots of water ballons involved to. Anywho...

Totally enjoyable.  Excellent job chris!:)


Lets see...1091 miles from home to the campout...1420 miles total.

Oh. about half way through SC the bus decided it didnt want to idle
off-throttle anymore..timing and dwell were fine, and i couldnt find
anything else...so i just three footed it the rest of the way. about an
hour out from the campout it started idling right again. wierd...

Its fixed now...John Yust, you were right.  the idle cutoff was loose! 


later...david
