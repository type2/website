Subject: Re: Crisis of Faith?

My turn! Your points should be set at .016 not .006. To adjust your carb you turn in the adjustment screw untill the car almost dies and then you back it out 1 to 1 1/2 turns. I have a stock dizzy for a 66-67 bug that i'll sell to you cheap if you want it. It sounds like a timing issue to me as well with a possible bad carb adjustment. I usually get about 20-23MPG in my bus, as a camper will get poorer milage than a passenger bus. I can take a look at it if you want, but I don't deliver!
