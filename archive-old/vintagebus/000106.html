It turns out that the guy who bought the speedwell bus was the same guy who 
bought my friend mikes 58 kombi.
The 58 was even LOWER than the speedwell bus.......ambulance partition, NOS 
safaris, rear hurst bumper, accesory license plate light......_dot_complete with 
a trans that pops out of fourth and a rebuilt 1776. This was the bus that set 
the new mark of lowered busses to come. I guess the 12K mike got for this 58 
is NOTHING in comparison to a 63 bus with ZERO accesories.....and its a 
*63*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mikes 58 should have been double the price in comparison!
Wonder when this guy is gonna step up and make his offer on the 54 judson 
panel?????
I cant wait till radio bus hits the stage........Gonna have 100K price tag on 
it.....
Ill make this guy pay for my COLLEGE education! =)

Did he fix the rust first?   Seems expensive for a Bus needing rockers, cargo 
doors, and ?  Neat logos.

Doesn't &quot;Himmel&quot; mean &quot;sky&quot;?  I don't get it.

- Everett 
'55 Bus - worth less than that.
