Subject: RE: [VB] safari windows

I haven't seen the metal ones close-up, but just got my set of the CE
aluminum ones this weekend. Very strong and very light, with the
v-channel construction. I like them a lot and am eager to both get them
in and compare them more closely to other aftermarket ones and to
factory parts for correctness and strength.

Hi Thom,
If CE ones are made of aluminum it will be interesting to see if they
have
the strength of the originals.  Eric's father was a mechanical engineer.
According to him one doubled aluminum thickness to get same strength as
steel, but with 1/3 less wieght.

&gt; The cheep repros have a flat-bottom frame.
&gt; These have been well known to be flimsy due to only being one walled.
To
the point when one goes over a bump in the road with windows open, to
flex
enough at the slider arm pivot points to crank/break the glass in half
in
them.
