Subject: Re: TR: [VB] Ate MC rebuild kit question

Could you wire the brake fail light to the emergency flasher light? How would you do this?

.....

Dual M/Cs lose one circuit and many drivers, say my 
wife (true story), never notices this.   You probably will not hook up 
the &quot;brake fail&quot; warning light on a retrofitted old bus.  When the 
&quot;safety&quot; circuit, the second one goes, it goes all at once and often 
with little or no warning.
