&gt; &lt;&lt; Hey listees,
&gt;         Does anyone know of a supplier of good used front windshield glass? I
&gt;  craked both of mine last year trying to put new seals in :( Sort of feel
&gt; like
&gt;  an idiot for that, but the magazine I was using for pointers said to &quot;sit on
&gt;  the front seat and push on the glass with your feet&quot;. They made a horrible
&gt;  noise when they cracked, but it didn't sound like $150/pair plus an
&gt;  additional &quot;crating fee&quot; worth! That price is out of the Motorworks catalog,
&gt;  and I have no comparison of what they should cost. Since I live in the
&gt; frosty
&gt;  northwoods, finding a splitty in a junkyard is nearly impossible. Thanks in
&gt;  advance... &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You can just go to an auto glass place and have them cut it new for you. My
&gt; side windows were all replaced in tinted glass for $20 each!

Jerry has the right idea, but be careful to use laminated glass for the windshield(s).
The side glass need only be tempered, but the front needs to stay in one piece if it is
cracked.  I changed all the glass is my 63 with glass cut at a glass shop.  For the
windshield pieces, laminated glass normally used for shower doors was used and was just
the right thickness.  (Not DOT approved I'm sure)  If you have saved you broken pieces
they can be used as patterns and to get the thickness right.
