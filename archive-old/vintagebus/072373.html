&gt; Item number 2412427091 at that infamous auction site has interesting 
&gt; camper gear.  Looks like a home-do addition of westy suicide cabinet 
&gt; and bed, but check out the screens on the driver side popouts.  And it 
&gt; has a double outlet over the left rear taillight.
&gt; 
&gt; This bus looks so much like mine (mine came straighter), but IMNSHO 
&gt; *my* fakewestia interior is better. :)


well to me it just looks like a thrashed so-42 with no pop top. missing a lot of things! all the
easy to remove stuff guess they didn't need the bed to be soft all the way!  not a bad price tho
