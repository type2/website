Subject: Re: LOOSE HEADS (CONTINUED)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't believe in the band-aid approach, so I'd rather not go the
&gt;&gt;&gt; locktite route if I can help it.
&gt;&gt;Well if your case savers are pulling out then you will have to go to case
&gt;&gt;savers with a bigger outer diameter.
&gt; 
&gt; I think he meant that the nuts keep loosening up on him.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see why a Loctite-type solution would hurt anything, although it
&gt; would have to be a product that could take a good bit of heat.
I agree, I don't consider Loctite to be a bandaid... it's good stuff and
I routinely apply it to the head nuts. Last time I tried RTV (on my Type
4), as per Will Wood's suggestion, but the jury's still out on that one.

Keep in mind, if the case savers are pulling out, that would appear as 
loosening of the nuts. Loctite will do nothing to cure this situation
other than keeping the nuts from vibrating off the studs after they
loosen.
