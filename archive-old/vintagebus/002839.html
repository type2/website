&gt; &gt; PS: Solvang is 40 minutes north from Santa Barbara. It is a quaint
&gt; little
&gt; &gt; Danish Town  I guess you could say nostalgic.
&gt;
&gt; I guess you can say &quot;tourist trap&quot;!  The decor is Danish, but it's
&gt; about as genuine as Hollywood.  It's fun for a quick visit, but I
&gt; don't think I'd want to stay there.  Prices for everything are
&gt; sky-high, even when compared to the normally inflated Central Coast
&gt; scale.
&gt;
&gt; I used to belong to a motorcycle club that often took rides to
&gt; Solvang.  The wives seemed to like buying ceramic nick-nacks, but
&gt; there wasn't much else there.  When I became tourmaster I got back at
&gt; them by having the club take a ride to Taft! (scenic oil fields!)

George,
    You're forgetting the best cookies in the world and great bread.
    I used to do a 100 mile bike ride every year that started and ended in
Solvang, couldn't get enough of those cookies after the ride &lt;G&gt;
    Also, used to live in Morro Bay and always made up reasons to get down
there just to buy bread and cookies.
