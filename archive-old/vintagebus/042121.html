&gt; How could you let your bus be used and them to show it being  towed away in the
&gt; end
&gt; How sad :(

The towing just makes it more realistic. he he. Actually it was to have
run out of gas but I see thay added CG smoke in there. Actually, David,
the guy in pink, backed it into a very large pine tree. I should
probably take a picture of the dent while its still there.
