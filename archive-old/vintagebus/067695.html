&gt; Would this problem apply to a single cab?  I.E. is the tank in the same
&gt; location in a truck as it is in a regular split bus?

Hi Thomas,
The SC tank is well forward of the rear axle and actually is much lower than 
the tank in the nornal bus.  Just taking a side look at a bus and a SC where 
the gas door is reveals alot!  This results in a heck of alot more room over 
and behind the tank, plus no body flange to clear the tranny bellhousing 
under the tank.  Which is why we have an extended hieghtwise 1968-71 bus tank 
project in the works.....
