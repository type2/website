Subject: Re: [VB] Rear seat belt retrofitting

I think rear mounts were standard as of 66 or 67.   my 65 westy has factory 
mounts for the front but not the back.  

When I installed front seat belts in my 61 I used some broken torsion bars 
and drilled holes, cut about 1 foot sections.   Put these under the bus where I 
bolted the seat belts on and used big washers as well.   Other  largish metal 
plates will do... take a look under the front seat belt mounts of your bus.

How to mount my new belts?

I'm thinking of running a long piece of barstock or c-channel/unistrut under 
the bus between the framerails to mount to.

Has anybody dealt with this. #3 is on the way and we need seatbelts!

thanks,

Billy
