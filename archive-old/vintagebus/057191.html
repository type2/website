Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

I agree, almost. If someone takes a picture of your
bus at a show wouldn't that be considered public
domain? You can't restrict photos at a public event
can you? Regardless, if they post it (still &quot;their&quot;
picture)on a website and you don't like it I would 
expect them to remove it, as a courtesy.

&gt; I don't like it, it's my Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I've removed photos from my site as the owner's
&gt; request or made modifications
&gt; like blanking out the license plate, it's no
&gt; problem.  I also have a lot
&gt; of digital photos that are for private use only -
&gt; Buses stored in owner's
&gt; garages, people's back yards full of parts, etc..
