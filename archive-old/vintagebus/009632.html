:now that we know there were ribbed truck bumpers
:vwhoward has 1 on his 58 BINZ, what years were they made, are there slash and pointed truck bumpers, or only ribbed, kyle said there is a slash truck bumper ( i have never seen one)and i have also never seen a pointed one, so has the mystery really been solved or only part of it?


The one I saw was on a '63, slash, I believe. I was too stunned to notice which style it was. Hopefully Harry's pictures will reveal that detail.
