On my 59sc the alignment shop missed centering the steering wheel by one
half turn.In doing this it turns one way really tight and the other way
really wide.CHeck to see that it is the right steering box,Thom I believe
had a funky 'new&quot; box on his panel.

Subject: [VB] Short Turning Radius on 64 SC


After Driving Eric's P. Bus Sprout I realized my turning radius on the
64 single cab is way short compaired to Eric's and what he said to all
other splits he's driven, I thought that mine was normal and that's how
all splits buses where. Any one know what the turning radius should be?
What might be the problem with mine? How can I correct it?

And you all know I appreciate any advice!

Meredith
