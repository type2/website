Steve

This list IS NOT A CHAT SESSION, and if you treat it as one your
subscription will be cancelled. Before you post a message please make sure
that it has legitimate bus content. This is enforced. 

&quot;Legitimate&quot; means that there is a good reason that 800 other people
should spend their time reading your message. &quot;Bus&quot; means not-Beetle,
not-Ghia, not anything but aircooled Transporters. There are other lists
for other models. General mechanical/technical/shop stuff is fine if it
applies to somebody's Transporter problem.
