Subject: Re: [VB] gettin' of the grease/mud

I use detergent and water in a half keg on the big cajun-
cooker/homebrew burner. Boil until they're clean.

&gt; If you have the time, simply soak them in hot water and soap.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, use solvents made for degreasing
&gt; 
&gt; You don't need high temp paint, but if you go to bare metal you really
&gt; need to degrease well, prime, and paint to get the paint to stick.  Try to
&gt; preserve the original paint if you can!

&gt; &gt; I have some valve covers and misc. tin with the 40 years of road gunk/oil/dirt 
&gt; and whatever else. They are straight and from the small areas I have cleaned off 
&gt; the paint is still intact. What is the best way to clean off the gunk without 
&gt; screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a miracle/mystery product just a 
&gt; way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What method?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If there is no reasonable way and I go sandblast them, do I need to use high 
&gt; temp paint? I've never painted valve covers before... do they get hotter the 
&gt; engine tin? I know I should powder coat them but....
