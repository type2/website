Hello all! Just wanted to pass on what a great time was had by all at
the 5th Annual Bulli Brigade in Tampa, FL this weekend.  A HUGE THANKS
to listee Mike Brown for putting it on and for organizing a caravan of
about 20 busses to our hotel. It was my first all-splittie event and I
was so excited looking at all the busses that I had to let my hubby
drive my bus so I could watch them all! :-) It was cool to be able to
go to a show and see ALL  KINDS of busses---not just fancied-up
perfect restos but also well-worn and some just plain beat up.  I came
away with the feeling that a splittie loses a little of it's
personality if it's TOO perfect. This same weekend I decided to forego
the ultra-expensive bodywork and paint job to instead get a really
good but not more-perfect-than-new resto and now I can sleep more
easily at night.
If you PNW'ers can ever make it way over here for a show, this one is
really cool and lots of fun.  Thanks again, Mike!!!  :-)
