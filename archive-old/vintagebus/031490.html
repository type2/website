Subject: Re: [VB] rough idle

If you have an air leak on one side it will cause the problem you
describe. Make sure the bolts are all tight between the carbs and the
manifolds and the manifolds and the heads. Any damage to the gaskets can
also let enough air leak in to cause this. I've seen intake gaskets fail
just because they had a little wrinkle in them before they were
installed.

Dual carbs aren't that much trouble once you get them right. I never
touch mine except to check the balance at tune-up time.

&gt; Help Please,
&gt; I have a 1600 DP with dual Webers (bought new about 2 months ago). It idles
&gt; rough. Cylinders 3 &amp; 4 seem to be not firing all that well. If I pull the
&gt; plug wires one at a time from the dizzy, you can't tell much difference on 3
&gt; &amp; 4, but you can tell alot of difference on 1 and 2. I replaced the plugs
&gt; and wires last night. It didn't seem to make improvement at all. My
&gt; question, could the carb on that side not be supplying the right mixture of
&gt; fuel and thereby making those two cylinders not fire correctly?? What else
&gt; can I look for? The engine has only 2700 miles since rebuild. Any help or
&gt; suggestions would be helpful.
