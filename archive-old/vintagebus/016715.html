For what its worth, I have no problem with the AIRS site as is. I too agree 
that if ANYONE gets into trouble weather it be a memeber or someone just 
passing down the road, I would do what ever it takes to help. I will be the 
first to admit I am very limited in knowledge, but my car trailer and tow 
dolly are always available to help move. Also, if I dont know the answere, 
there are plenty of NON airs members in the area that would be willing to 
help. If there is anyone on the list that ONLY wants to help other AIRS 
members, I feel sorry for them. I was not brought up help just those I want 
to, but rather those in need.

AIRS or any other type of list is a wonderful thing that should be meant to 
help ALL those VW folks. I would only hope that if the day comes that I need 
a hand in someones area and I am NOT in a VW that day, that I wont be turned 
away from atleast a friendly phone call for advise as to that areas help. 
Yes, there are those of us that drive Brand X cars.

We tried to start a club here in town and the guy wanted only folks that HE 
liked in the club. I told him to shove it because thats NOT the VW family 
way.

Again, I wont turn anyone down for help that comes thru Florida....even the 
so-and-so that lives in NC that screwed me out of a title. I may be mad as 
hell about that still, but I am human and cant leave a person stranded.

&gt;Just my thoughts and I'm not &quot;officially&quot; on the AIRS list because I
&gt;recently got a more permanant address and just signed up for the AIRS
&gt;list-it hasn't showed up for 2-3 weeks yet, but anyways..I don't know if I
&gt;speak for anyone else out there, but I'll be glad to offer help to anyone
&gt;out there driving driving a bus (or just about any VW for that matter),
&gt;whether or not they're on the list, or on a long road trip or just going
&gt;home from work.  I'm newer to the bus world and my total knowledge and 
&gt;tools
&gt;are limited, but if one of the many quarts of oil I have behind my seat 
&gt;will
&gt;help, I'll gladly stop on any road for them. I've gotten much help from bus
&gt;folk and hope to return it someday.  As far as SPAM goes, I have the 
&gt;ability
&gt;to delete it at no expense to me, so there's one vote from me to keep it as
&gt;it is.  If someone doesn't really want to help busses and their passengers
&gt;in time of need, why be on the list? (not intended to be taken offensively)
&gt;To me giving a helping hand to someone in desperation is worth deleting 
&gt;SPAM
&gt;every day.  Take it as it is with the knowledge that I may be opening my 
&gt;big
&gt;mouth again without fully knowing all the facts of what's going on.  Happy
&gt;driving--Chet
