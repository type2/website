My hunch is that the WalMart inventory system has seen how these
things are flying off the shelf, and is ratcheting up the price
accordingly.  The first reports of these toys pegged the price _at_ $9.99

Don't feel back - some guy paid $40-something for one on ebay!

&gt; Has anyone else paid this much?
