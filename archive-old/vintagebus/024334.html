There's a chance that it could be a spring rubbing the hub on the
inside of the drum... if the drum is off, you can look at it and tell if
that is the case. 
	That happened to me, and the spring was fine... so i sparingly removed
material on the worn area of the drum-hub with a short round file,
similar to a chainsaw-chain file, until I had removed enough to stop the
harmonic whining... which sounded like that sound that you can make by
wetting your finger and running it around the lip of a half-full wine
glass.
	It could also be a metal brake line rubbing... that is where things get
dangerous... the parking brake being kept in carefully guarded
adjustment will make sure that, should a line blow out or rupture, you
will be able to stop safely. It happened to me, but there was little
warning in advance aside from a whine that developed on my way to work
one day... the parking brake saved me from certain doom at the bottom of
an interstate exit ramp. After work I was able to bend and flare a new
piece of line to replace the damaged section (it ran between the wheel
cylinders on the RF area), and drive home with peace of mind. 

Good luck fixing it...
