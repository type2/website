 After the dozen or so how stupid I was to spend so much I spent about 1 1/2
hours today talking to JC and Hag. Bottom line is the 5K miles per year and
garage. Unhook your speedo and drive or ?? Just make sure you hook up the
speedo after the big one. Tell them it's 100% garaged also .

Anyway to each there own and my the ADJUSTER RULE. No more list comments
please i'm done.

John( the stupid one) Howard
