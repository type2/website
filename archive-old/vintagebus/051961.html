Subject: Splitwindow crew sited

Howdy List, OK, it may be an everyday occurance for
some of you on the West coast or other places where
Type 2's are as plentiful as horsesh*t at a rodeo, but
where I live, Eastern Oklahoma, they're scarce as
hen's teeth. That said, I've had two people in the
last 4 days tell me of seeing a split window crew cab
in town. They said it has CA plates and is white in
color. My 63 crew, according to most around here, is
the first and only in these here parts, so hopefully
you can understand my excitement that there is another
running around loose here. Most folks around here are
convinced that my crew is good job of customizing and
can't believe it when I tell them , nope, came from
the factory that way. They all think it's a hacked up
bus. Had a guy yesterday that I never could convince.
Just kept grinnin sayin, &quot;AW, go on!&quot; I'm just hoping
I can run across it before it heads back to CA. Does
anybody know if there is a listee that has spoken
about going to Oklahoma or Arkansas?? Just curious if
it might be a fellow listee. :) (Te-He that last line
rhymed).

See ya,

3DPete
Buck - '63 Crew cab
