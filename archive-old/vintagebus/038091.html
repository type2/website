Made a few observations this weekend as I did not get to attend the OCTO or 
Classic activities :( 

Sanding down the primer that was sprayed over the original paint to see what 
type of damage was done to inspire the primer job.  It appears that the front 
passenger dog leg has been whacked a little and smoothed with bondo.  There 
really isn't much maybe a thin coat is all.  The dogleg though does have rust 
underneath and replacing would be what I feel is necessary.  If anyone knows 
where to obtain such a beast let me know.  Its the early style for a 57.  

The rear corners on the bus appear to have been replaced due to rust at some 
point, I'm thinking early to mid eighties and are not that bad.  Sadly, 
though, the lower areas have started to rust again due to sanding to bare 
metal, priming and then leaving to absorb the moisture in N. Cal.  So 
possibly I would like to find the lower 10&quot; or so to replace.  

I pulled the small nut tranny that was in there.  No good.  I have the split 
case waiting for funds to send to get rebuilt.  It was interesting to see one 
persons attempt to fix the grub screw from backing out on the shift coupler.  
It was welded to the shift rod!!  Someone also welded in an adapter bracket 
to fit the small nut in there.  I took my time first starting with a chisel 
to knock the welds, these were pretty shady welds if you ask me.  Then it was 
time for the grinding.  I only grinded until the weld was just higher that 
the metal.  Im not experienced in this stuff so I'll leave it alone for now.  

Pulled all the seats out and I have a rusty front bench so I'll be needing 
one of those which shouldn't be hard.  Next step...Body work!  With most of 
the damage revealed I should be able to get a fairly accurate appraisal.  
I'll keep you posted and post the pics from this month maybe tomorrow.  If 
anyone has anything that I might be interested in call or P-mail me.

Sorry I missed you all at OCTO but I will be sure to see you at Jerome!  I 
can't wait!!
Everyone show up, It's for a good cause!!
