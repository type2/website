Subject: source for bearings...

I priced a set of SKF 6015 ball bearings for the differential going in
the '65 type II yesterday... the local place wanted $99.99 each for
them.
I did a search with the copernic engine (prior to this) and came up with
(among others)
http://www.wbds_dot_com/
you can search for parts using several different criteria all at once...

like part number, manufacturer and type of product. very good.
I found what I was looking for... SKF 6015s at about $52 apiece....
they should get here in about a week and a half.
hope to have this thing roadworthy by the time the LEAF festival comes
around...

later...
