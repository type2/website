Subject: Re: [VB] Quick VIN question

Yeah, if the vin starts with 227; then it should be a '67 bench seat
standard.  You can assume anything you want about the bus, it just won't
necessarily be correct.  But in this case, I would say that it'd be safe to
assume that it's set up for 12 volt.  Don't know of many people that would
take a stock 12 volt bus and convert it to 6 volt.

'67 Deluxe Bus

&gt; However, upon receiving the bus, I see the VIN number
&gt; starts with &quot;227&quot;. This can only mean that the bus is
&gt; a 57,67,or 77, right? (A 67 in this case).
&gt; And assuming that the bus is indeed a 67 (the M-code
&gt; plate begins with &quot;01 9&quot; indicating it was built
&gt; January 9, 1967, correct?? So should I assume from
&gt; this code information that the tranny and all the
&gt; electricals in this bus are set up for a 12 Volt system.
