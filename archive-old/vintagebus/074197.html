I aim for pressure, of course. As the oil heats the pressure will drop with
the viscosity of the oil. Little pumps need big help.

You usually have to sand down the body to get the 2 thousands max
clearance with the cover on but
after that they seem to work pretty good for open engine applications
like trikes and dune buggies. I like to take my oil from the oil cooler
holes and route it to the external cooler and the oil filter. The
fittings for most of these adapters are 3/8&quot; and I have never had a
dangerous pressure drop. Plus the oil filter slows the oil down in the
cooler an additional amount of time to extract a little more heat.
------------------------ Clip -------------------------------------------
Are you shooting for a target pressure, a target temperature or just
hoping for the best?
I ask this because VWs tend to seek higher oil pressure, GM seems to be
the middle of the road and Ford usually runs low pressures.
I can't speak for other cars except Mercedes which runs low pressures as
well (don't know about diesel).
Jags don't count since they loose the rear mains on a regular $5000.00
schedule.
My MGs pumped 60 max and ran for 11 years that I owned it and 9 years
that the new owner/buyer has had it, and that is a 7000 rpm engine if
you're not careful. (1275cc Dual stock Solex).
I don't want to plug my new business but I'd like to have somebody run a
fully enhanced Ceramic engine and monitor the results.
If somebody had the many boxes of new parts I'd be willing to do the
ceramic coatings at a legal theft price if they are knowledgeable about
VWs.
