NQ, 

As was suggested, check with your CC company since what you ordered was not 
what was delivered.  I would also check with the post office about mail fraud 
and file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. 

&lt;&lt;What the heck does No Quarter mean anyway?&gt;&gt;
I recently read a book about naval battles during the American Revolution. 
&quot;No Quarter&quot; was equivalent to &quot;No Mercy.&quot;  So like, when the captain of the 
Serapis offered John Paul Jones &quot;Quarter&quot; he replied &quot;I have not yet begun to 
fight&quot;  Is this your take? or do you not have any 25 cent coins? :)
