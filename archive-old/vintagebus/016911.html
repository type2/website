Interesting.  What the brake switch effectively does is short across
the flasher relay, so that both lights come on solid.  It also
bypasses some of the bits in the column-mounted turn switch.
Everything goes through the emergency flasher switch (if you have
one), or through the headlight switch.  I'd open each of those up in
turn, looking for scorched spots.  Melted wiring and such is also of
interest, of course.

Before doing any of this: DISCONNECT THE BATTERY!  You really only
need to undo the negative side (the one going to the body of the us),
and make sure there's no way anything will then provide a circuit from
the battery's negative terminal to the body.  I usually unbolt the
strap at the body end and put a ziplock sandwich baggy or used latex
glove on it.  If you don't you've got a better than 90% chance of
frying far more than your brake lights....
