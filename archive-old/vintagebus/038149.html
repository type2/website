Subject: Re:  [VB] Engine Swap

was writ:

I need to temporarily swap engines between my bug and
bus (won't bother to explain why).  I will be taking
a 12v DP 1600 from the bus and putting it into a 1966
6v bug. I would like the bug to remain 6v.  Other than
the obvious (swapping generator, regulator, coil et
al.) what are the issues I might encounter?  Will the
12v flywheel go in the 6v bell housing?  Will the
starter line up and work?  I have heard both good and
bad opinions and don't want to start until I have a
definite answer.
-----------
swap  gen, regulator  (gen stand if the 6V one is small diameter), choke, cut 
off on carb, coil

re FW, if your bugs bell housing has not been ground the 12V fw will not fit. 
  leaving the 6V starter in place and transferring the fw to the motor going 
in makes sense.  the 6V fw will bolt of the same to the new motor.  checking 
endplay is not a bad idea.   and as long as you will have to swap all this 
stuff you might as well replac ethe oil cooler seals and main seal

the 6V starter will work with teh 6V FW, the 12V starter will work with teh 
12V fw, but not mix and match.    you can mix and match the solenoid, and 
keep the 6V solenoid with the 6V system and use the 12V body so the teeth 
match, though.
