Subject: V-Twin 20W-50 Mobil1?

http://www.mobil1_dot_com/motorcycle/index.jsp

Anyone ever tried the V-Twin 20W-50 Mobil1 in their air-cooler?

Seems like the perfect motor oil for air-cooled engines if you want to run
synthetic.  I have not seen this stuff before so availability might be
limited to H-D stores?  From what I understand there is more ash in this oil
to help with valve guide wear as well.

Maybe tonight if I have time I want to &quot;blow some oil&quot; by doing some thermal
tests on the basement (read: man cave) stove.  Probably compare Pennzoil
HD30, Pennzoil 10-30, and Mobil1 10-30.  I want to see if I can bake the oil
and turn it into sludge :)  I will try to do the time/heat interval testing
as well.  The only bad thing I can think of is that from what I can remember
my thermometer only goes to 300 degrees and I would like to try and hit
350-400 if possible.
