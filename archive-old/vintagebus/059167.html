Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse Box

&gt;
&gt;Is there supposed to be a clip of some kind that holds the fuse box up
&gt;against the plate it mounts in?  

Yes.  One end of the fuse box is held by the metal fuse box bracket
(attached to the body), and the other end has a metal clip.  Look at
item 22 on pages 581 and 583 of the '58-'67 parts book at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .

&gt;And any suggestions on how to remove paint off wires?  Will paint remover
&gt;eat at the insulation?

Possibly.  If the paint is on thick enough, just bending the wire might
crack the paint layer.  Brake fluid eats paint but is compatible with
rubber; I don't know what it would do to the plastic (probably PVC) wire
insulation though.  You can carefully scrape the paint off with a sharp
knife.  You just want to remove the paint, not the insulation too - think
shaving rather than sharpening a pencil.  You can also follow the wires
to where they are bundled in the plastic sleeving, and either pull the
wires out a little further or cut the sleeving back to see the right
colors.

You could always put numbered tags (home-made or ready-made) on the
wires if you're just trying to get the fuse boxes swapped correctly,
but this won't help too much with future servicing.
