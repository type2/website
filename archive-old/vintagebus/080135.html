Subject: Re: [VB] Randar wheels???

I have a set of  four '74 wide 5 Thing wheels if anyone needs 'em! Since 
there's only ONE other bus with that look, I should get $980 a wheel so 
you be the second one to ride the pony.

BTW, the Bakersfield show was MUCH better than I expected. Pioneer 
Village is a GREAT venue for a VW show and the weather is usually pretty 
good this time of year. VTO and German Dreams put in a lot of work and 
made it look easy. Ronnie, there are better ways to get to the show than 
through the crack-ho areas. You could have taken 58 on down to 99 North 
and gotten off on Buck Owens Boulevard!  I'm not sure, but the park 
might actually be in Oildale, not Bakersfield.
