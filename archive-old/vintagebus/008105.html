It has been a pretty eventful day for me!  Increased my VW population by 1.
The new addition is a '67 Westy with a pop-top.  I admit that I don't know
much about the Westfalia campers, but I bought my '67 Kombi with the intent
of making a &quot;home grown&quot; camper out of it, so this was an easy choice for me
to make :-)  I would have purchased this vehicle if it was just a plain ol'
Kombi with front seats only.  I paid for this bus less than 1/3 of what I
paid for my Kombi, and just a hair over what I paid for my '62 Shell, and
it's more complete and solid than both of 'em.  I think I finally stumbled
onto my dream bus!

The man who owned this bus had owned it for over twenty years.  From what I
saw today, it is complete (minus engine and wheels, the front wheels were
stolen) down to the splash pans on the rear bumper.  The only thing I
noticed missing was the rear apron.  When I looked at this bus, sat in it
and crawled around in it, it really felt good.  It had an aura of life about
it.  I could tell it had been lived in and enjoyed.  I'm glad of the
opportunity to put it back on the road!  It's not perfect, but it's a
wonderful starting point and I can't beat the price with a stick.  I have
added a web page for it on my site if anyone is interested:

A quick quip about two busses for sale.  They are from the individual I
bought the Westy from.  They are a '70 double-door panel and a '71 bus,
$1500 and $600 respectively.  Not splits -- perhaps someone could forward
the info to the bay list?  Here is the page I set up as a favor:

That's all.  Just wanted to share my great day!  :-)
