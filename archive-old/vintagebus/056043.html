Subject: Daily Driver Poll

Well i don't drive to work since the shop is here but , if we need kero for
heat or anything else for that matter i drive the Binz, or if its warm i'll
use the Thing. The reason being in Jan. I traded the Dually in on my wife a
2001 Yota before the mileage got out of reason. So at this point the 2 VW's
are my only mode of transportation for company business. I woose out when
its real cold and have wifey or daughter do my errands, Grin ,later
