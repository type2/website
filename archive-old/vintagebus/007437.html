I don't have a lot of time to post this so I'll cut to the chase.

The steering box, bracket, and front beam were delivered to the sandblasting
place today.  The goods are supposed to be ready tomorrow noon for pickup.
Here's to prayers and crossed fingers.

This evening I grabbed up all the parts I could find and painted just about
everything that you can remove from underneath the front of a bus - shy of
the MC.  Things that were painted where the clutch and brake pedals/levers,
spindle and kingpin assemblies (making sure not to get it where you
shouldn't), backing plates, front section of the shift rod, rubber axle
bumpers retaining rings, dust caps, swing arm, those pieces that slide into
the axle beam that the king pins hook on to, you name it, it got it.  It all
looks great hanging up in the shop to dry - I even took a picture of it now
that I found the camera! :-)  I can finally get some shots of the bus repair
job in action.  Tomorrow I hope to paint the brake drums, axle beam,
steering box, and the bracket.  Once all this stuff is painted, then
reassembly can begin.  Ronnie sent me out a batch of parts Monday morning so
with any luck, that stuff will be here in time for the weekend.

Even though this project is going along really well, I can't say that I want
to rebuild the front end of a bus again very soon.  I'm surprised I even
decided to tackle it...even the engine rebuild seems easier but I'm not
griping - just stating my observations at this point.  I gotta go close up
the shop so more later...
