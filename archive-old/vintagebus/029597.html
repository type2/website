One thing you'll never get is this list to agree on something like a
freeway flier transmission.

In fact, I don't agree that you need a bigger engine than a 1600 to use
one. I have a 1600 DP in my bus with my flier tranny and I love it. I
can go 70 mph in the summer and not overheat the engine. I get 20 mpg at
this &quot;unheard of in a splitty&quot; speed. I don't spend half my time driving
up steep hills (and I live in East TN) so my average speed is still
higher than I could achieve with a stock tranny, even if I do slow down
some on hills. As far as I'm concerned, a freeway flier transmission is
exactly what any bus that's going to be driven on the highway needs.

I liked the flier in my bus so well that I just put one in my truck last
weekend.
