Hi Chuck&amp;Jan,
If you are going to tow your bus with one of those rental tow dollies make 
sure to use both the nylon straps over the wheels and the steel safety 
chains.  We have met too many folks at the rest stops with only the nylon 
straps on, due to no instructions fro the rental shop.  Check the nylon 
straps every 50 miles to make sure they do not loosen up (Which they do!).  
Probably a good idea to buy some chains to add some more hold down power.
Hope to see you guys back on the list soon, Eric&amp;Barb
