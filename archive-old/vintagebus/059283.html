Subject: Copyright-a different perspective

Dammit, I hate when I give my un-solicited opinion like this, but hey, why not?! Someone using my pix in their site or whatever would be a compliment to me. From a musician's point of view, it's kinda like getting one of your songs covered by a band that obviously admires you, otherwise they would not do a cover version of one of your songs. HOWEVER, if they are selling that song and making money from it, then I want my royalty check also!  So, everyone feel free to snake any of my pix, graphics, lyrics, or whatever. But if it goes on an album or a commercial advertisement, I WANT MY PIECE OF THE PIE!  FWIW,



Peace, John Baker
