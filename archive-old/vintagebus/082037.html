yes, but depending on the actual diameters of the pullies it will make
a difference. I found some measurements from someone on the samba and
make these assumptions.

stock crank pulley 6.75&quot; 
power pulley 5.75&quot;
std gen pulley 4&quot;
356 pulley 3&quot; (this number was extracted from known ratios)

these measurements were not belt groove, but OD. Making the huge
assumption that they all ride down the same amount in the groove the
proportions should be somewhat close (i think).

crank pulley | gen pulley | ratio
    stock    |   std      | 1.67:1
    stock    |   356      | 2.25:1
    power    |   std      | 1.43:1
    power    |   356      | 1.92:1

these numbers are very much up for interpretation since I don't have
all the parts to make real measuerments, but I'd love to have some
real measurements from someone with all of the parts.

&gt; Also, don't waste money buying the oversized crank pulley if you're full
&gt; flowed. It will not clear the pump cover. I ran into that problem when I was
&gt; trying to test it a couple years back.

yup, saw that on the ac_dot_net site.
