&gt; In any case, the next question is where to find an appropriate
&gt; shut-off valve.  I went by the &quot;has all the esoteric hardware&quot; place
&gt; today, and although I could find lots of brass plumbing fittings,
&gt; they
&gt; all had plastic packing that looked like it wouldn't hold up to
&gt; gasoline (rated &quot;air, water, oil&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm figuring on getting two, preferably with a locking disconnect
&gt; between them, so there's no need to ever fight with pulling the hose
&gt; off of a tight-fitting barb, or anything else that's likely to stress
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?

Fuel valves can be had at aircraft suppliers and RV supply shops.

You might also want to check out the &quot;dry break&quot; quick-disconnects that
allow you to disconnect the fuel lines.  The connectors automatically
seal themselves when you disconnect them.  They are available from
racing suppliers, AFAIK.

My problem with the disconnects, valves, etc. is that I usually replace
rubber lines while the engine is out.  No matter what kind of valves I
have in the system, I'm still going to have to open the lines to
replace them.  The only solution I can think of is the old-style
reserve valve on the tank.
