Subject: Re: [VB] Tire pressures



&gt; 
&gt; Aren't the rating molded into the side of the tires when they are made a good enough &quot;suggestion&quot; of what the manufacture thinks the 
psi should be??

It would be, except for that pesky word &quot;MAX&quot; in front of &quot;PRESSURE&quot;.  The manufacturers don't intend you to run the tires at the 
maximum pressure.  They intend for the tires to be run at a pressure appropriate for the loading.
