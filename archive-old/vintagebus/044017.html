Yesterday was Columbus day and the post offices were closed in observance.
No manuals went out, but for those who have ordered them, the Type I
manuals will go out today!
Looks as tho I will have both at Oktobugfest in Puyallup Washington the
17th and will probably be at Jeff Sleaters semaphore booth for awhile
first thing if you want to pick up copies there and save shipping.
Thanks
