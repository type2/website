&gt;The two I already tore  down both had 4.375 ring &amp; pinions in

&gt;
&gt;So you managed to find a splined 4.375 set?  I assume it 
&gt;also had a 8-bolt ring gear?  If so thats not too common
&gt;of a R/P.  I believe that that ratio came in late '67/68 Type 1
&gt;transaxles right before they switched over to the 4.125 ratio.

I think the 4.375 splined is a Gleason now that I think about it.  
It is an 8-bolt ring gear.

&gt;I have seen a few 4.375 ratio'd 8-bolt sets in post-'64 Busses but 
&gt;they were keyed. AFAIK- the post-'64 splits came with a keyed 4.125 
&gt;pinion but could be ordered with a keyed 4.375 8-bolt R/P set.

The '63-67 Bus Bentley says that the 1200's came with 4.125 and the 
1500's came with 4.375.  When they changed from the 1.29 to the 1.26 
reduction gears, they changed the ring &amp; pinions which resulted in 
the final cruising rpms being about the same.

&gt; The 3.875 set only came with the splined 4th as they 
&gt;were introduced in '73.  I assume you want the keyed pinion shaft
&gt;so you can run the Bus .82 4th gear?

Yes, I want to use the .82 4th.  Berg sells new 3.785 keyed for about 
$160.  I assume these were for swing axel late model beetles and buses 
in markets other than the US (Europe, Australia, Brazil &amp; Mexico).

Thanks Todd.
