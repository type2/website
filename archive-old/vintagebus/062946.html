Subject: RE: [VB] New front window rubber?

  If you can wait a few weeks I will have it. Otherwise it's a matter of who
you like the best. I currently use WCM, I also have Wolfsburg West and I
just got some that is made in Europe (so I am told, but I haven't tried it
long term yet). I also have some from Brazil and if they ever get off their
duffs in Germany I will have correct left and right with molded corners.
   I have WCM in all my buses and after almost 5 years in one the windshield
seals are still in good shape and I live where it is over 100 degrees half
of the year.

It's time to remove the front windows and crappy seals so I can clean,
de-rust, POR 15, prime and paint the opening.  Who makes the best fitting
replacement front window rubber?
