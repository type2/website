Clara:

I hope you have that &quot;Titan&quot; vs &quot;Titian&quot; rap on a cut and paste template
somewhere because I know you have plenty of opportunity to use it.

One of the things I have admired about VW in the 50's and 60's era was the
interesting and descriptive names they used for their colors.
I have a feeling that General Motors has an entire bulding of marketing
analysis experts somewhere to come up with stuff like &quot;Opaque Firemist
Guava&quot; (metallic green, medium).
The simple yet eloquent names of VW colors is much more appropriate and
tasteful.
(just my .045 DM).
