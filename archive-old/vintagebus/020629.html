Subject: Missing Da'Bus
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi Bus People   I am missing my Bus.I have been hard
at it (yeah right) trying to get her back on her feet
and back out there in  the slow lane.I am sure that
traffic misses having to go around me.....&quot;Hey! Where
is that old long hair dude with the beat up VW
Bus?....Oh well...must be along side of the road
somewhere&quot;......I am getting to the dirty part of the
work.Got to pull that engine out....Ok...when I get
that done I should...Replace the cv boots and the ????
What else should be standard to do when that old
engine is out of the way???          This is a mini
restoration (matches my savings account) a very
limited attempt so I can get it rolling along
again.All seems fine except for the engine.So if you
have any ideas what small parts to replace while in
there ...I will say thanks now.
