Subject: camshaft gear trials

ok, so i got the crank all done up today, stoopit shop breakage and all.
so i'm testing camshaft gears, and i've hit a snag .    again :)


i have a slew of cams, and i'll be damned if all of em don't seem 
wrong; ronnie suggested i set the endplay and THEN measure cam lash, 
but i don't know that i'm getting better results.

i have 2 unmarked cams ronnie sent to try, that weird one i wrote 
about the other day (marked -3), 3 standard size, 3 -1s and a +1.
they range from german vw to resolit to ???
in theory, if the std rolls the cam out of the bore, i go smaller; if 
it feels like the crank is rolling a good bit before moving the cam 
ie too much lash, i go bigger. be damned if they all dont roll right 
out! the -3 actually lifted the thrust bearing out with it.

so either i need a wacky gear (vw went +7 to -7 - good luck my 
finding even +/- 2s!!!) or i need some tips and tricks from ya'll to 
poke at it some more.........
