Subject: Re: [VB] Hot VW's? No, COOL VW's!!!!

My family moved to Arizona as far back as 1956 to avoid exposure to DHMO. My
father had a health condition attributed to it. I can verify that there is no
sign of it in Southern Arizona inspite of the rapid build up in Maricopa and
Pinal counties. I was once forced to sell a potentially bitchen 1968 Buick
Sportwagon 400 over the stuff. My wife apparently had become affected by DHMO.

The $800. that I spent on a complete rebuild of the Ford150 (I traded for my 63
VW bus) yesterday set me back and will probably cool my chances of a real
vacation (again) this year.

I personally object to Harry developing a product that will be using the stuff.
Doesnt DHMO affect the Ozone layer or change global warming?
