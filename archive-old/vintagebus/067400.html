we already have one... its called biodiesel. i just dont understand why our 
government doesnt put more money into development. the mpg are huge, it 
could bring agriculture back to our farms and reduce emissions greatly!

BUT... i am one to talk, i drive a 325 HP Subaru with no catalitic 
converters :-p so i guess i answered my own question. but i would consider a 
biodiesel as a family car, i tried to get the wife to get the TDi in her 
Beetle so we could convert it.
