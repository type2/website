Subject: Change the Stats, bummer, '66 gone
Date: Mon, 22 Jun 1998 06:25:41 -0700

Well, I sent a letter a couple weeks ago giving
the buyer a deadline to come get the bus.  On the 
last day he actually arrived and the bus is gone.

I gave him some good reading material from the
Type 2 website along with a copy of Bob Hoover's
Sermons to educate himself.  He's not on the 'net
as of yet, but, I'm nudging/pushing him hard.

As much as I would have liked to fix up and keep the
bus, I think it's going to the right hands.  This is/was the
'66 kombi with cutout rear wheel wells, flared fender
trim, air scoops, large rear tires, black diamond tuck
upholstery, dark red shag carpet, custom camper in
dark wood, you know way kool custom 70's bus.

I think/hope that he will keep it as it currently is,
a retro custom bus.  Hey, if it WAS customized 25 years
ago, can it be called retro? or is it actually VINTAGE custom?
My head hurts thinking about this.

Anyway, I hope to keep in touch and find out how it turns out.

Now, I am truly bussless.

Jeff
