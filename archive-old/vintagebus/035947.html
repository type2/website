there's a barrel spring at the fanshroud end, but I don't think I have one.  
Also wonder if that's an oldschool thing.

Hi James,
Yes it is!  A pre-1500 (pre-1300 in Europe) kind of thing.

&lt;&lt; The barrel bushing produdes 5cm from the back of the shroud, should it be 
flush? &gt;&gt;
That depends on which one you are using.  Check out:

and take note the differances of parts A87 and A88.
We also use the hose clamp trick in front of the fan shroud with a large 
diameter washer around the accelerator cable conduit.
VW used from about when the tunnel tranny case came out in 59 a boden tube 
sheeth for the accelerator cable.  This sheeth allowed the accelerator cable 
to pass around the tranny without rubbing on the tranny near the nose cone!  
Most VW trannies have been run since leaving the factory without this sheeth 
and have worn groove/s in the tranny case!
The sheeths we just recently found are about 1/4&quot; (about 7mm) too long.  
Found out we could carefully tug off the rear crimped on fitting on this 
sheeth to allow us to trim it and reinstall the crimp end.  The result came 
out perfect!  We will see if we can find the new part number we used.
