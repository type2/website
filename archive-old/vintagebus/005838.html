Hello Bus lovers,
 For those of you that did not know there were a couple of Bus related
milestones in May. On the 25th of May 1947 Ben Pon sketches his I deas for
the Transporter based off the Beetle based truck that was used at
Wolfsburg.
And on May 13 1950 the Kombi Bus is introduced. It all started in May.
