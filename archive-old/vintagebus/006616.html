  I just got an interesting phone call from a company that builds airplanes
looking for RGB (big nut). It seems that for the last 30 plus years they
have been useing VW Big Nut RGB's in airplanes powered by Corvair engines.
The interesting part of this is that they turn these at 4500 RPM's at the
axle shaft, I'd like to figuare out what MPH that would work out to be. All
this talk of handgernading RGB's by turning to many rpm just went out the
window. 

If anybody feels like seeing corvair powered airplanes and a few VW powered
airplanes there is a fly-in at Laughlin airport in Febuary, 2001
