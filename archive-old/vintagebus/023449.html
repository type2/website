Gents, I appreciate the replies.  Good information.

Jack, what RPM do you think you are doing when 65.  My temps hold OK (230)
at 65MPH, but I'm going well over 4000 RPM at that speed.  I believe this is
a stock-built tranny (67) with large redux boxes (for sure on that).

Given the shift points for 1/2/3 are at around 3700 (?)... running at 4100
for sustained periods must put some wear?

You really jump to the great poing that you have 70,000 miles and your
engine is still going strong... that is the bottom line I'm after.  I
suspect you can go for some time at 4100 RPM cruise... if it makes the
difference between 70,000 miles life of an engine and 90,000 miles (staying
at 57MPH / under 3900 RPM) on an engine... does it matter?  I'm more
concerned about the factors that decide between an engine lasting 40,000
miles and 90,000 miles :)  Muir and general consensus is that 90,000 is GOOD
for a Type1 bus?

Anyone have data to help with.  Eric, I know you have done some tachometer
looking... does 3700 sound right for stock speedometer shift points?

P.S.  The point is that we are sharing information.  Just because we compare
notes, doesn't mean we are afraid to drive!

I actually wrote a big long response to the original post, but it got
lost in the ether and I switched back to netscape from outlook...

But instead of higer octane, why not be certain that your combustion
chamber compression ratio is set to a modest level. Too many rebuilt
heads slapped on without a thought to cc'ing turn into gawd-awful high
ratios, meaning you have to run the spendy juice or pre-ignite. 
I run around 7.2:1 ratios and can run the cheep stuff, even in the third
world and still run pretty cool.

I agree that running all-out on a hot day will help to overheat you, and
slowing down when all other variables are working against your cooling
ability will save your bacon.  But I think that with the later &quot;big nut&quot;
tranny like on my 65, top speed for cruising is something closer to 65
than 57.  I have gone all day in hot weather when on flats at 60-65 and
not overheated. Thats with a non-doghouse dp1600. Hell, I have even
pushed it to 70-75 for short spurts....

I have more than 12  3000+ mile trips with this bus under my belt, one
over 8000.... and nearly 70k on this engine... so I must not be doing
everything wrong...
