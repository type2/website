&gt; &gt;KROIL I ordered a gallon off the net last week
&gt;
&gt; Hey Rex,
&gt;
&gt; Tell us where you ordered it and how much. Thanks.
&gt;

http://www.kanolabs_dot_com/ I've been using this stuff for years. It makes
Liquid Wrench and WD-40 look like Super Glue. Silikroil is the best, I've
used Aerokroil and plain old Kroil too. They all work great, but the
Silikroil leaves a little lube and rust prevention behind that the others
don't. They send out a little newsletter from time to time once you're on
the list and they'll usually run a special where you get a gallon can of it,
an aerosol can of it and a pump oiler for around $25 or so. I'm on my second
aerosol can since 1980 and I gave the first away while it was still half
full. It's a handy item in your road kit. You don't use as much as with
those other simulated penetrating oils.
