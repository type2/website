&gt;Well..as my subject indicates I need some advice on manuals for my bus. 

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/reading.htm

&gt;Also, I suppose this question will probably be answered when I get my 
&gt;manual but where is the reserve tank switch???  

The valve itself is screwed to the bottom side of the gas tank.
A Bowden cable (wire in a tube) runs to the front of the Bus and
ends in a smaller knob just to the right of the heater control knob.
Sit in the drivers seat, lean forward, let your right arm hang down,
and both knobs will be near your fingertips.  The heater knob is the
big one with notches in the edge that rotates; the fuel valve knob
pulls in and out (but if yours sticks, don't force it!)

&gt;is it possible to put in a fuel guage??  

It is possible.  You may have to install a later-model tank to get
a tank with the opening in the top for the fuel gauge sender.  You'll
need a sender and a gauge, and you'll need to string a wire from the
tank to the dash.
