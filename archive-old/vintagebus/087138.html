Subject: Accelerator Cable madness...Tricks?? HEEELLLLLLPPP!

AAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGG!  The throttle cable broke on my
71 bus and I spent about 2 hours and used everyone one
of the seven dirty words you can't say on television
about 100 times each while trying to get the new cable
fed thru the tube and it simply won't go!!  It gets
hung up where the tube bends just above the tranny and
will NOT go past that point.
SO does anyone have any cool tricks to aid this
process and to help me keep what's left of the
tattered remains which were once my sanity??
Thanks &amp; PEACE!
John Baker
