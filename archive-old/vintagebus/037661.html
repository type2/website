Subject: From Russia, in a bus...

Anybody catch &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; last night?  A classic Bond film, but more
to the point...whilst driving around Istanbul, James is being tailed by Russian
agents in a black sedanish sort of thing....and it is being tailed by a
beautiful red and white deluxe (didn't get the window count) splittie....what
country would send out their secret agents in such a conspicuous auto?  

Why IS Istanbul not Constantinople?

Sorry for potential list rule violation...it's almost Friday...
