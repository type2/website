The lights on my 6V 55 westy were brighter than the lights on my friend's 12v '66 bug.

This topic has been beaten before - it's not the volts, it's the resistance.

FWIW, I converted my 60 DD to 12V because of the convenience factor; 12v stuff is
easier to get, and easier to get support for in the field.

&gt; &gt;I dont know why people convert from 6V. Some people think you can't drive on 
&gt; &gt;6V, that when you get an old VW you HAVE to convert it or it'll something 
&gt; &gt;horrible.   For the record, I did convert  a 59 truck to 6V.  People would 
&gt; &gt;comment on the truck, as they do, and I would say ya it's 6V.  I was told I 
&gt; &gt;could convert it to 12V, and I would enjoy telling them I had switched it 
&gt; &gt;back to 6V.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; 6V works fine on my mom's '62 Bug and worked well on my '63 Camper.  But 
&gt; when I'm out in the woods and want to really see where I'm going...I'm 
&gt; sorry, but I gotta go 12V.  Not to mention that I like my tunes and have 
&gt; the luxury of running Xmas lights inside the Bus this year.  In a place as 
&gt; packed and crazy as the Bay Area, I want people to see my brake lights at 
&gt; night.  The last thing I need is major body work bills because Joe BMW in 
&gt; his M3 didn't see me stopping.
