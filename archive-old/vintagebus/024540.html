&gt; &lt;&lt; I am looking for this VW trans info so I can tell what I am looking at
&gt;  when I go to a swap meet. I WANT TO GET THE  66-67 reduction box.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; The 1964-67bus used the same reduction gear boxes as far as we can tell.
&gt; Unless one ordered something different like mountian gearing.  Eric &amp; Barb

  Dear Eric&amp; Barb
                My research has show the following reduction box
information...
                                           Reduction box raitos
1958    1.40
1959    1.39
1960    1.39
1961    1.39
1962    1.39
1963    1.39
1964    1.39/1.26
1965    1.39/1.26
1966    1.26
1967    1.26
    I have not been able to tell the 64/65 differences by any method.  i.e.  M
CODES or
trans. stampings. The only way to be sure ( with out a tear-down ) would seem
to be stick with the 66/67. I know that these raitos seem small but add them
to all the ring and pinion changes..... it means alot on the road . Once
again, my research shows the 4.375 R&amp;P raitos only for sure in the 66/67.
SOOOOO.
    Thank you for all your help.
Your VW Friend  Paul in Ohio.
ps Still looking for a way to tell 66/67 from a external inspection.
