Well, lets see,
You got rid of the voltage regulator, right?
You shoudl have a big red wire that goes to the top of your alt.
You should have a black wire coming up through the harness that snakes
behind the carb and is hot to the coil. Then there is a green wire that
is to the oil pressure sender switch. And then the last one should be to
the charging light, and it goes on a spade connector on top of the alt
also. 

The biggest wire should be the main hot from the alt to teh
battery/starter. After that is hooked, try the ign switch and see what
gets hot, ( this requires a partner and a test light)  that goes to teh
coil positive, if that is hooked right you shoudl hear the cut-off jet
click, so  iguess you can do it solo... I have two oil preuuse lines,
because I run a gauge and an idiot lite, so if you do also, thats
another wire.... 

The shortest wire should be the one to the charging light. mix and match
until it works. 
I'm guessing you have the wire from the neg coil to the capacitor ( I
mean condensor) still hooked up right?

Thats from the top of my head. Maybe someone else will weigh in more
decisively.
