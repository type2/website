back n the olden days of yore,  there was one mailing list for all bus shaped 
VWs,   barndoor to Eurovan, called (Vanagon_at_lentil_dot_com)    As it became more 
inhabited, it was decided to split the list.    The water cooled type2s 
stayed at Vangon_at_lenti, while the aircooleds fled to a newhomeland at 
type2_at_type2_dot_com.   All was peace.    but the population grew and the schism 
was evident and some of the type2_dot_com list left when the new vintagebus list 
started.   

so now there is a watercooled (vanagon _at_) list

a bay window or LOAF LIST  (type2)   for 68 on buses

and a splitty list (for 67 and earlier buses)

there are also various regional VW camping lists (CCC, wetwesties, more?)
