using roofing patching product on windshields. How is that used? &gt;&gt;

Hi Joel,
Yes, it does.  Best to strat pulling in the bottom first and work your way to 
the top evenly up each side.  Use either automotive wire with the insulation 
on or smooth weed eater line.  Twine will possibly cut the rubber due to it 
rough surface.  Use roofing tar (Unfibered is fine.), squirt with a plastic 
mustard container a line of it in the groove in the rubber which the glass 
mounts to prevent that nasty white haze forming from the water attacking the 
plastic inside the laminate glass  and paint the window frame with tar.  If 
you are really nervous about getting it to seal also paint a little around 
the side of the rubber that mounts against the body.  Eric&amp;Barb
