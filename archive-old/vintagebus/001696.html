     I saw the post about Rimco and wondered if anyone has their address or
     phone #.  I did a search over the net but no luck there.  I also
     cannot access the type2 archives.  Been trying all week.

     Anyway, I have a Pict28 that needs rebushing and no one around here
     wants to touch it, including me.

     Ray
