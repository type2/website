&gt; Anyone cutting up a 62 or earlier bus/truck.  I need the front bench

&gt; bottom.  Someone put in a 1/3 rd 2/3rds front bench seat and I'd like to
&gt; eventually put the correct one back in.
hi all,

wasnt 62 the year they changed from full bench to 1/3 2/3?

what chassis number did this change take place?  if your bus has all teh
tracks for the later seat style welded in all professional like, it might
already be correct...

peas,
