Subject: Top end rebuild ?s

Hi folks, It seems I will get to rebuild my top end sooner than I thought. I
went down south on a 400 mile round trip and come back with only 3
cylinders. There is a leaking again between cyl and head, and between the
cyl and block. I got a gasket kit, rings, and pushrod covers.  The PO
rebuilt the top end (or someone did it with/for him actually), and I think
they left the jugs on and that is why they are leaking horribly now, he told
me they did not replace the rings and this added to that idea.  I also found
the heads very loose when I pulled the motor and inspected. I dont know why
they might have loosened so quickly, but I think the soot between the heads
and cylinders requires disassembly for proper seal anyway.

Is it neccesary that I bring the heads to a machine shop to be lapped? The
valves were reconditioned and I believe are in good condition, just
wondering if a piece of glass and emery cloth with get my 1600dp going solid
again.  Are there any tricks for the best head to jug seal?

Also what is the discount auto of everyday product that I can use to seal up
the cylinder bases?

Should I order new nuts? Should I make sure there are lock washers? New?

Is locktite a good idea on these head nuts?

Thankyou in advance, I need to get some semi-perminant closure on this damn
thing before I can move onto the front end.
