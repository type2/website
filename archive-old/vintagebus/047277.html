Subject: bus show in SF bay area this weekend?

hello all!
ive heard something about a vw show in the SF bay area this weekend (27,28,29) and was wondering if anyone knew anything about it.
 ALSO...i have a question about MY wipers...the arm coming from the motor isnt connected to the wiper system..i know i need to take the little screw that holds the damn thing together out ,and push in the rod, and screw it back in, BUT i cant find a screwdriver small enough taht can go in at that angle. i know i could just take the whole thing out and put it back in, but id rather try to put it tgether where it is. the first rain of the norcal season is upon us, and i really hate reaching under and moving it manualy :P ...
ALSO----if anyone has some diagrams for interior panels in a bus, that be great. i have not n4early enough money to buy them pre maid, and even farther away financialy from buyin OG ones...so i want to make my own..so if anyone has the diagrams to make some...please give me a HOLLER&gt;..
love, 
meredith
58 dd panel (douglas)
