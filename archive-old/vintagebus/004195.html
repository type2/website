&gt; They ARE Vans!  Bus production ceased in 1967.

Here in Northern Illinois, it's not unusual for one air cooled bus driver to
pull over when we encounter another one. It's always fun to get to know
somebody with the same affliction, I rarely see another bus just on the
street, but when I do it's an event.
NOBODY in a new VW waves, van or jetta or whatever, sometimes when I'm
driving my New Beetle someone in another NB waves, but usually not, kinda
sad.
Lots of people driving regular cars wave at my bus too, usually kids and
lots of peace signs.
