I am having a hard time finding thermostat parts for a 1600dp in
Sacramento CA. New, used, whatever, I'd really love to have one for my
Alaska trip. I need the whole deal: rods, flaps, thermostat and
bracket. Would one of you kind Volks sell me this stuff or direct me
towards a source? I am expecting to freeze my rear end off, but I'd
like to keep the ratwagen warm.

Thanks,
Joel
