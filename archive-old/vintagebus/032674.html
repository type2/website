no, don't do that. air cleaner and cable problems are sure to arise.
 take the carb off. take a small pliers and GENTLY bend the bell shaped
linkage piece away from where it hits the alternator. shouldn't take too
much.   you can also dremel the alternator a bit for clearance.
or you could try to find a carb that has the original alternator linkage
and replace it on the new one, or find a new one with the alternator
linkage already on it.  ronnie?  this is a common problem, easily fixed.

&gt; &gt; He needs one of the spacers to lift the carb up an inch or so, or
&gt; &gt; one of the 211 manifolds which is offset to the left.

&gt; &gt; &gt; His problem is this. He built up a 1641DP engine to put in the bus.
He put 
&gt; &gt; &gt; an altenator on the engine instead of a generator. He has a new BOCAR
34 
&gt; &gt; &gt; PICT carb, bus seems to have some interference with the altenator. I 
think 
&gt; &gt; &gt; he said it was the linkage or something.
