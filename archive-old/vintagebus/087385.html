&gt;Gee, a fancy VW Show vs. a campout with lots of buses. I'm leaning 
&gt;toward Jerome.
&gt;...
&gt;Thoughts anyone? Which direction will the scales tip?

dude, i didn't even LIKE the time i went to jerome and i'd still say 
go for it!  ;)

and if you go, you have to get there via the old railway right of way 
from behind the mountain. you'll need a good map to find it, but once 
on it you can't miss.
