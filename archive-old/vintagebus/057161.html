Subject: Re: [VB] Air Cleaner Question

By all means use the oil bath, but you'll need the  bus style - the bug

&gt; I'm thinking of changing the air cleaner on my '65 from the foam kind to 
&gt; the oil-bath kind.  I've got a 1600cc engine (from a 71 bug, I believe) 
&gt; with a Solex 34 PICT-3 on it.  Can I put the old-style air cleaner on 
&gt; this?  Any recommendations or warnings?
