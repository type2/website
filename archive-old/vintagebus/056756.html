&gt; It's funny but Berg's instructions don't mention this.  Maybe their tin 
&gt; piece, which is riveted on, covers that area.  I'll have to look at it 
&gt; carefully and maybe call them on Monday to sort out some details.

Hi Thomas,
That all would be real nice to know!

  Did you also have to modify the exit duct hole in the front tin?  That was &gt; 
&gt; mentioned by &quot;Lou in Havasu&quot; as something he did.

The shell piece of exhaust tin we cut the forward side and taper it wider on 
the cooler side to match the wider cooler, but keep the outlet side that 
connects to the exhaust tube stock size.
