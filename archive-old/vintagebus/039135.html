Subject: single cab bed replacement
Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2000 09:58:11 -0800

i've found a pretty decent but stripped '60 single cab whose bed could be
used on my '56 single cab.  my truck is in pretty good shape except for the
bed.  according to one story, a previous owner left cardboard or cloth in
the bed through one winter of rain and the bed became so rusty that the back
half (engine half) was thought better cut out.  in addition to the
non-existent back half, the front half is crap.  while i'm loath to cut up
this '60 single cab, i want the bed for my truck.  what would be the best
way to do this?

the owner (a non-vw person) who's willing to sell parts of it, suggested
that i cut the whole bed off and weld the back end to my truck.  what are
the pros and cons of this?  my immediate thought was to cut the bed out
below the cross-member supports and then free the bed panel from the
cross-members and perimeter.  now i'm kind of inclined to buy the whole
truck and take the bed panel off at the spot welds and curled lip of the
perimeter.  that way i could weld diamond plate on the '60 and it could
continue life as a flatbed and my truck would be as i want it.  it seems to
me that i have a lot of ideas but hardly any sense or guidance.  thoughts
please.

cheers,
