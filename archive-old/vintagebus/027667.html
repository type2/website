Subject: Bus status, and hitch q's

Hello friends,

Metwiz rescued my bus from the side of the road, where I'd apparently
broken the cam on the way from Everybus to the Farmington show... My new
hero!

I'd planned on going up there this past weekend with the engine out of
my '74 bug, my toolbox and a big floorjack, but my transportation plans
fell thru...

I had a crazy idea... If I had a hitch for my bus and a towbar for the
bug, I could drive the bug up there, swap the engine into the bus, then
tow the bug home...

I've got a bug towbar at work and several bug hitches... I was wondering
if it was possible to modify a bug hitch to fit the bus.

If anyone has a picture of a bus hitch posted somewhere or could e-mail
a pic to me, or even just describe to me how the bus hitch is attached,
I would really appreciate it...

david
