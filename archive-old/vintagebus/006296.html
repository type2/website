&gt;Another advantage to Sears stuff is that you can often buy parts for the
&gt;stuff they sell.  I once bought some parts at Sears for a Taiwan jack I had
&gt;bought elsewhere, but Sears was selling one which was almost identical, so
&gt;I ordered the parts at Sears.

&gt;I suggest that you see if Sears will sell you the parts to rebuild your jack.

It used to be at Sears that their &quot;best&quot; was name brand stuff. Well that's the case for this jack and as it turns out just about any hydraulic shop can do this.
