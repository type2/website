Subject: Re: Thanks for the help! - Horn wire fiasco

&gt;The best I can tell is that the mystery beercan piece is the exact 
&gt;diameter of the blinker switch and looks to be a small piece of one.
&gt;Misc trash I guess.  The woodruff key was &quot;spare parts&quot; that some one
&gt;accidently let fall in the shaft. I checked and the one at the steering
&gt;wheel is still there.

I bet the beer can broke off, fell down, and a PO tried to get in there
to fix and/or retrieve it.  In this process they graced you with a spare
Woodruff key, gave up, and put it all back together.  :)

&gt;Now I need the set screw for the horn cap ground wire connection.

Probably something like a 4mm thread.  You may not be able to find a
metric set screw that small but you should be able to find a regular
screw or bolt that will work...

Thanks for posting back and letting everybody know how it came out!
