Basically any bus that came with laminated glass (I believe only U.S. export) 
from 56- ~~64 Came with this style latch.
The glass companies couldnt drill holes through laminated glass so this style 
slider was introduced.
My 57 has them.
My 58 singlecab did not.
My 58 sunroof standard did!
My 59 singlecab did not!
My 61 deluxe did!
My 63 deluxe did!
My 64 standard did not!
Go figure!
Most people swap them out for the non laminated style because the felt 
channels are more readily available.

My *guess* is that the D.O.T. (Dept. Of Transportation) required &quot;AS-1&quot; glass 
in passenger vehicles from 57-on and since sekurit was producing AS-2 (Not 
quite as clear) from 57-62 then the passenger cars used the laminated stuff. 
In 63, maybe sekurit intorduces as1 glass and then all the busses adopted it?
I could be wrong, feel free to correct me.
That made no sense to anyone but me.

If you mean the ones where the latches are on a metal track instead of the
glass, i believe those were used from 59 or 60, to 62 or 63.

Not one year only, but a limited application to be sure.  My 61 has them.

take care,
