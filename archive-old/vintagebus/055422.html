&gt; Very true.  It is used primarily for extra oil and to prevent oil
&gt; starvation.

&gt; &gt; He was amazed at how FULL the rocker areas got at anything over 3500 rpm
&gt; This is true, but to what extent does this harm the engine?  I am sure if
&gt; this was a big problem there would be few if any busses rolling around on
&gt; the highway today.

Probably not a big one if you pay attention to the oil level.  You have
about 2 liters of oil in the engine and the valve covers can hold about
1/2 liter each.  If they were both full that leaves 1 liter to sit in
the sump.  Now, combine this with going around a corner and you might
uncover the oil pickup, but I doubt that this would be a problem in a bus.

&gt; For a stock engine I would not bother with a deep sump.  Only if I was
&gt; running an external oil cooler (with 180F thermostat switch) would I put a
&gt; sump on my engine.  The extra tuning and cooler would make additional oil
&gt; demands on the system which could take away from the crankcase oil supply if
&gt; it is too small.

My major complaint with deep sumps is that they add complexity and reduce
ground clearance.  One good whack with a rock and the case is endangered!
