 We met at the office of Arizona Childrens Asso today and presented them
with 2 checks totaling $2500.00. The local newspaper was there and will run
a picture and small article. The money will be used in LHC and will help
many kids this year. We want to thank all who attended and donated items for
the raffle, with out YOU this could not happen. We were also able to donate
$100 to NEATO to help cover their yearly insurance costs ( around $800 per
year I think) More chapters should help support NEATO. Thanks again to all
who attended and helped and we will look forward to seeing you at BBB5 Jan.

John Howard and all the members of London Bridge Bullies

PS:   LBB  Tacos at Kelly Park in April. see you there
