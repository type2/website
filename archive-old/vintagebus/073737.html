&gt; then drove this Double Door Panel over to my local VW dealership here in St.
&gt; Charles, Missouri and had the State safety inspection run on it.  It passed
&gt; with flying colors.  It caused quite a commotion with all the service staff as
&gt; well as a few customers who came over to check it out.  

I'm shocked they even knew what it was, let alone looked at it
mechanically!  Seeing that most dealerships balk at even a 10 year old
VW.  &quot;Wow, a '95 huh?  That's almost too old, we might not have the
parts for it&quot; was the reaction I got in a dealership parts department
recently.  I was looking for parts for my '95 water pumper.

I stopped in with the '62 DC to check on the above mentioned parts and
not one person even mentioned it.  Might as well have been a '87 Yugo
for all they knew.
