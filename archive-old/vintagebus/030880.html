We have seen these only in pairs top and bottom and most of the time the rear set
of hinges also are drilled but the anti branch, weed, thingey catcher was not
installed.  Many times on high tops because of trees?????

&gt; Not sure, but our DEC60 walk thru panel camper conversion seems to have Only
