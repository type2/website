Subject: RE: [VB] Hula Girl/BobbinHead website.

Ya know, I was hesitant to post up fearing I start some new stupid
craze... then again, maybe you all will just think I'm a bit more odd
than you already do...


Anyway, I've been looking for a vintage antenna topper from the 60's or
early 70's and a vintage pair of fuzzy dice.

Anyone have something like that they'd like to sell or give to a
demented wierdo?

... gotta keep it ALL vintage... but necessarily stock.
