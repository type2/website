Subject: EV stuff [long]

All,

Here are some comments on the recent EV thread.  First off, a good
write-up on the fundamentals of all this is here:

&gt;The hybrid car kind of uses this idea in that it sometimes runs on
&gt;electricaity, and sometimes gasoline, and when running on gasoline
&gt;it charges up the batteries.  This means lots les gas in used.  At
&gt;least that's how I understand the hybrid cars.

That's basically true.  It uses the electric motor for low speeds
and acceleration, and the gas engine for higher speeds and steady
cruising.  The gas engine can be smaller than it would be without
the electric help, and can be tuned to operate over a narrower RPM
range, which is more efficient.  Another trick is &quot;regenerative
braking&quot; - you can recharge the battery when coasting or braking.
It's like compression braking, except instead of driving the pistons
mechanically against compression, you're driving a generator
electrically against the battery.

There is another kind of hybrid referred to as a &quot;mild hybrid&quot;.  On
these, the starter and generator are combined into the same part and
are engaged with the powertrain all the time.  There is no other
electric traction motor and a relatively small battery pack.  The
engine can be shut down at a stop and the starter/generator is used
to restart it and move the car at low speeds.  They also do regenerative
braking.  Mild hybrids are usually implemented in conjunction with a
36/42 V electric system.

&gt;Very nice bus Thom and when the new generation of hydrogen fuel cells
&gt;get cheap enough, you can drop one of them in there along with a
&gt;hydrogen tank and have the range of a gasoline powered bus, without
&gt;the pollution.

I think this may become possible, but the range won't be as good as
gasoline.  Even highly compressed, hydrogen doesn't have the energy
density of gasoline.

&gt;
&gt;Even fuel cells, the pie in the sky savior, will require the development
&gt;of a huge infrastructure for producing and delivering the fuel cell fuel.

From the article above, there's more hydrogen in a gallon of gas than
there is in a gallon of liquid hydrogen.

&gt;Many of the best FC systems seem to lean towards methanol based fuels
&gt;because hydrogen FC have severe storage and delivery safety problems
&gt;to overcome.

I think that fuel cells will end up being powered by some liquid
hydrocarbon fuel - gas, diesel, alcohol - instead of straight
hydrogen.  Storage and safety are big reasons, and so is infrastructure.
Alcohol may be produced differently than gas, but when it's ready, you
can use the same pipelines, tanker trucks, and gas stations to get it
to end users.

&gt;we already have one... its called biodiesel. i just dont understand why
&gt;our government doesnt put more money into development. the mpg are huge,
&gt;it could bring agriculture back to our farms and reduce emissions greatly!

How to make biodiesel: Fill up the John Deere with diesel.  Go out and
plow the field and plant something.  After a while, fill up the JD again
and go spray fertilizer and pesticides (both petrochemicals) on it.
Finally, fill up the JD again and cut the stuff, dump it into a diesel
truck, and haul it to the processing plant.  There is some debate as to
whether you would be better off just putting the diesel in your car in
the first place - it is maybe not clear that biodiesel gives you more
energy than it costs to make it.

&gt;
&gt;And burning alcohol will just mean a change of carb, nothing else.

Ethanol has about two-thirds the energy density of gasoline, and
injecting more of it may help.  In the Geo Metro hybrid I've worked
with, the head was also milled to bring up the compression ratio to
get more power.

&gt;Not to mention the tax which at the time was $1.50 a gallon
&gt;if you were going to use it on the road!!

Retail vehicle ethanol is currently about the same as retail gasoline.
It might be ten cents more a gallon this month and ten cents less the
next month, but it's about the same.

&gt;The thing I don't get about this whole hybrid / elctric car thing is
&gt;battery life is about 4-5 yrs.

For a pure electric car, this is true.  For a hybrid, the battery is
used less, and usually has a more intelligent controller regulating
its charge and discharge, so it lasts longer.  Toyota has a 10 year,
100k mile guarantee on the Prius battery pack.

&gt;Once we end up with all of these old dead batteries laying around,
&gt;what do we do with them?

You recycle them.  Lead-acid batteries are heavily recycled right now,
over 90% according to some studies.  There are pretty strict regulations
on their disposal, as well.  Other batteries, like NiCd and NiMH, can
be recycled as well.

&gt;
&gt;Now, to solve this problem, what they really need is a small reliable
&gt;spectrophotometer system inline to non-destructively measure the energy
&gt;content of said fuel as it goes to the injectors.

Ford's &quot;flex fuel&quot; vehicles that run on ethanol/gasoline mixes from E0
(straight gasoline) to E85 (85% ethanol) have a sensor for this purpose.
I _think_ it's some kind of sonic/piezo sensor but I'm not sure.

&gt;The best solution is to build as many nukes as required to choke the
&gt;arabs into submission. [...]  No air polution to boot.

Cool...I guess we can store the old fuel rods and stuff at your house
for the next 10,000 years.  (Yes, I know Yucca Mountain is or will
very soon be operational for this purpose.)
