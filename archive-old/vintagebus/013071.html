I am glad that I haven't had a chance to time this
thing yet.  Here it goes again if I am understanding
it correctly.  When I am looking at the teeth on the
pully
There is 1 notch, a space second notch, smaller space
and then a 3rd notch.  This is looking at it in a
stationary position so from left to right I am looking
at the notches 0, 5, 7.5. (with rotor pointed at
notch)  so if I measured the 7.5 off and took this
measurement and marked off appromately 23 degrees to
the right of said 7.5 notch I would be at 30 degrees 
BTDC?  Also I think I figured a way to fix my
dwell/tach meter. Check the tach on my golf which has
a built in tach and recalibrate (DUH!).  I appologize
for the repetition but I have become confused w/the
counter/clockwise stuff but if I am understanding this
correctly the reason it is so confusing is because
when the engine is rotating clockwise 7.5 hits first
so it would be read right to left 7.5, 5, 0..  Lastly
should I try to time at 7.5 or 10.  Or should I use my
ears as a guide and then check the total advance for
28-32.  I am really excited to drive the splitty. 
Hopefully I can crank out some painting so I can go to
the Bugout.
Everyone have a great/safe holiday.
