Hi Volks,

pleased to read about another commercial bus on the road!

Steve Fronczeck wrote to the List:
&gt; Here is something I've noticed about the cab divider. When driving at
&gt; night the cab divider reflects the oncoming traffic's headlights in
&gt; the rear view mirror, making it look like you have cars behind you. It
&gt; was a little distracting at first but I've gotten used to it.

It is a little irritating at first, I agree.  Also when reversing at 
night, you tend to see a reflection of what your headlights are 
illuminating in the interior rearview mirror, rather than what's 
behind your bus.  Reversing with parking lights only on is the 
logical solution.

But the DPO of my '72 panel removed the cab divider window (and threw 
it away :-(, hence *D*PO), and without it there's more noise and a 
nasty draft on the neck.  Don't do it, however big the temptation.  
(It's a PITA to install that window bithout tearing the rubber.)

&gt; I'm getting gas at the ol' petrol station and see the
&gt; air/water thingy is actually working, and it's free.

!! You mean there are places in the US that *charge* for use of the 
air thingy??!  Gosh.  :-(

BTW: I just sold a perfectly good Golf to raise funds for buying either 
a '68 post highroof or a '71 single cab, either of which would be my 
fourth bus, and no passenger or camper version among them.  Am I nuts 
or what?  :-)  Some started to call me the &quot;Panel Van Nazi&quot; here 
lately ('62, '71, '72 so far), seems I oughta go for the SC... to 
prove them wrong, you know?  Or mebbe both... we'll see. ;-)))

Yours,
    Erik.
