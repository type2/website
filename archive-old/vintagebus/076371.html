Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone know of any serious rat look buses?

Man, don't be so up-tight. Paint it BLACK and worry about it later!

Kevin Bell

....
&gt; Would you check-out that black satin paint,  way too
&gt; cool!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to do my bug that way when I paint it.

While flat black paint certainly has its attractions,
Kevin, there are 3 objections.

1.Like all black paint it looks great after wash &amp;
totally messy the rest of the time, showing up ALL
thumbprints, dirt, etc.

2.In summer it makes the bus a little solar oven like
the ones you can take camping. Panels are bad enough
without increasing that tendency with black paint.

3.More importantly than the previous 2, my wife has
put the kybosh on a black paint job.
