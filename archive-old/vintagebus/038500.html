&gt; I will have three genuine Westfalia 68-79 bus trailer hitches arriving from

I had what I beleived to be a factory(maybe dealer item) hitch on the '72
when I bought it. At the time I had no use for it so I sold it to a Ric for
his 1969 bus. It hid behind the bumper and bolted up between the bumper
brackets and the frame. Sorta like the cheese on a sandwhich.

As is turns out(or as Dave told us)1972 has a one year only bumper
so.......1968 to 1971, 1972 only and then 1973 to 1979 would be the
breakdown on which bumbers are interchangable. I do not know how the hitches
that Ron is getting ready to sell will work or if the above info relates but
I would like to know because I might be interested in a hitch.
