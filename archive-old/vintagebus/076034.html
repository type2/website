Subject: italian 'barndoor?'

due to circumstances beyond my control, tonight  i was forced to 
watch 'come september,' an awful movie with rock hudson. luckily, it 
had what was a dead ringer for barndoors in it! smaller - a little 
bigger than a bug - but round mirrors, skylights, 'barndoor' engine 
lid, round taillights, jailbars, popouts... hell, the damn things 
were even sealing wax red and chestnut brown!!
italian movie, so italian car? i am assuming someone here  knows what 
they are......
