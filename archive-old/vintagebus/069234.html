You better hope some of those pics have major camera lens distortion
going on.  Some of those pictures look they were taken from the
reflection of a fun house mirror.  If not that is one twisted bus.

&gt;Money Magazine.  One recently sold for upwards of $50,000.00 in mint condition.
&gt; 
Not looking like that!
&gt; 
&gt;I have invested over $7,000 and I will be sad to her
&gt;go.

He must have stashed the 7K under the floor mat cuz I don't see it in
the actual bus :-)  Love that Ebay inspired creative writing though.
