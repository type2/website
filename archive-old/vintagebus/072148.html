Subject: Re: [VB] Wipers

Wiper pivots are the things that stick through the body of the bus.  On a 67 
you have to remove the wiper motor/frame, and undo the tiny circlip at the end 
of the old broken pivot and pull the shaft out of the tube, and revers ethe 
process for installation into a 67 wiper frame.   the bracket thing is the 
frame, the round cylinderical thing is teh actuall motor.   Look in teh archives 
and read what I wrote about redoing my wiper motor in my 65 when I got it.   I 
also wrote something more recently about going through the wiper motor  in my 
67 riviera.  

I believe 66-67 pivots are reproed and available from wolfsburg West

When you say arms I think the thing you put the wiper blades on, that one end 
attached to the pivots that stick out of the bus.   Look at the online parts 
list at the obsolete doc project (link through vintagebus_dot_com) to get part 
numbers.  WW also uses VW part numbers.   ARms should be the same length R and L. 
   You could print out a pic of the list picture in question, and ask which 
part he meant.  

Did you get connecting  arms for the motor?  Connecting arms go from the 
motor to the pivots to turn the pivots.

&lt;&lt; MrMechanic said &quot;order some wiper arms.&quot;  I told
 him &quot;I did, they are here and you have them someplace.  They were in the box
 with the gas tank.&quot;  He held them up and said .. &quot;that's not what I meant, 
but
 you need them too.&quot;  So I went back to the Wolfsburg website and ordered what
 he was calling arms, that weren't really arms, they are 2 flat metal strips,
 left and right, one longer than the next.  They came and he said .. &quot;that's
 not what I meant, but you need those too.&quot;  He said .. I need the part that
 sticks through the holes in the bus that the arms attach to.
