&gt; &gt; &gt; I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is

&gt; &gt; &gt; steel tube attached that is cut-off and bent over to seal it.

&gt; &gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; &gt; That sounds like an oil pump for a auto-stick bug or KG.  Do you have any way
&gt; &gt; to send us an image of it or have a 1968 on type 1 Bentley manual to see if
&gt; &gt; it matches the auto-stick oil/hydralic pump?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I can take a pic and post it. Did the autostick use the engine oil pump to circulate the tranny
&gt; fluid?

Yes.  I have considered that one of these would make a nice way to build a
bypass cooler/filter setup.  Take a line from the sump, run it through the
AT side of the pump, then through a filter/cooler, then back to the sump
via the generator stand.  That way the filter and cooler doesn't interfere
with the pressure delivered to the engine.

George
