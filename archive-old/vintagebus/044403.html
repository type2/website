For the record, I agree with everything Ronnie has said 100%. Just 
the other day I had a pmail discussion with someone about how some of 
the more vocal people on the list make you feel like you have to 
justify doing anything custom to your bus. My opinion is that most of 
the people who read the list really don't want to deal with it and 
opt out. Kind of a shame really. I honestly believe some of the more 
&quot;stock or nothing&quot; opinions are the minority. And yes, there is a lot 
of hypocrisy in that arguement as Ronnie pointed out.

I think MOST people think in general &quot;it's your bus, do what you want&quot;.
