&lt;&lt; Do I need a the Letter part of the code to decide what blank is correct?\

Hi Pete,
Correct!  The 1955-early 64 key blank will fit several differant letter 
codes.  Give him the letter code off of one of your matching locks.  
Preferably the rear hatch lock which is most often the least used/replaced, 
easiest to remove.  This rear hatch lock is good due to it's less wear and 
tear making it a tighter more accurate lock for testing the newly cut key.
