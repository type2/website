&gt;It's not very tricky to rebuild a Solex 30-pict.   

I agree...I've gone through the 34 PICT 3 in my Dad's '74 Bug (1600 DP)
a couple of times, and gotten a little bit into the stock carb (28 PIC?)
on a '56 Bug.

&gt;You unscrew all the bits from each other.

If I remember right, on the 34 PICT 3, the throttle and choke plates are
screwed to their shafts.  This may be true on the earlier models as well.
Anyway, if these screws are nice and tight, leave them be...if you take
them out you have to peen them (booger up the screw heads on purpose)
so they stay put.  Little screws and/or throttle plates in your cylinders
can ruin your whole day.
 
&gt;It's nice to let them soak overnight if you have a friend with a solvent 
&gt;tank.

You can get a gallon can of carb cleaner at most auto parts stores
for $20 or so.  It usually comes with a little plastic sieve to put
the parts-to-be-soaked in.  It works pretty well, but the gloves are
a must (it'll straighten out your DNA), and *don't* use it in the house 
or an attached garage!  It stinks like crazy (trust me) and the smell
does not go away easily.  Depending on how gunky the carbs you put
through it are, you can re-use the bucket several times.
