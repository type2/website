Subject: No Oil Light Blooze
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Since the achieve is down, I need to ask the list about my trouble 
establishing an oil light on my speedo. I have a 67 Westy and the speedo as 
many of you know has at the bottom (Left to right) red Gen. light, blue high 
beam and a green oil light. All the lights work with the exception of the oil 
light. At the top the speedo lights work but the turn indicators dont. I have 
taken all lights out to verify that they are good. Filament is in there, 
grounded well, scuff all connections. Ignition switch maybe faulty, not sure. 
New oil sender in the rear. Checked with tester, no power going to sender. 
How does this sender work? I should see the green light when I turn the key 
right? All fuses are good. Can someone tell me what the lightbulb holder for 
the oil light looks like. Does it have onle 1 coneection or does it have 2?  
Need your help !
I hate electrical!!!!
