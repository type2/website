&gt; Ect. The guy is asking $3200 obo. Seems high to me, but maybe it's the deal

In your neck of the woods, it's probably worth a bit more, but in most
places these cars have a reputation for leaking like a sieve, if it's the
kit car I'm thinking of.  The completeness makes it rather attractive, as
these vehicles have usually dropped all their trim along the roadside.
