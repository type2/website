Subject: body vent?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well i got overly excited for nothing.
i forgot that the DC vents are shorter than the bus vents but other than that 
they look excactly the same once you turn them over and upside down.
i cant see no reason why they could'nt be used to repair earlier (outie 
vents).
anybody want to burst my bubble?
joe

or are the earlier outies on the buses also shorter?
