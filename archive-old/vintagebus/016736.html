Subject: Repro semaphore lenses?
Date: Fri, 16 Jun 2000 22:09:37 -0600
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


Is anyone making repro semaphore lenses?  If not, how many people
would be interested in some, and how much would you pay?  I need a
set, but if I'm going to have to go through the hassle and expense of
getting molds made, it'd be nice to maybe get some of the investment
back.  Finally, are there any differences between bug and bus
semaphores?

Tangentially related: has anybody come up with a good way of theft-
protecting their semaphores (other than by not installing them)?  I
suspect the answer is &quot;have someone repro the whole units for much
less than stolen/used ones are currently selling for&quot;....

Thanks.
