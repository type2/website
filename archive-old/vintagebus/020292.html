A couple points:

a) it's not Friday yet (not even in Australia)

b) similar programs *already* exist, but with the credits instead going to other industries?

c) there's nothing that indicates they'll come and spirit your 1970 westy away in the middle of
the night; this is a voluntary program on the part of the people giving up the cars.  Now the
auto recyclers have another potential customer for some of the early iron they're already
processing.

Here's the actual text of the bill:

What's more interesting is the stuff that was stricken...
