Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 Double Cab... 07-30-03

&gt;&quot;yosemite sam&quot; mud flaps?

I'm gonna use the naked lady ones I think.

&gt;substitute the front license plate w/ a confederate flag plate?

Got some &quot;flamed&quot; ones, but might have to consider doing the &quot;General Lee&quot; 
thing on the roof instead of the Iron Cross I had planned.

&gt;antlers of some sort on front of cab?

I've got a ram skull from one of my dead Barbado that I had saved for the 
trike...might have to consider it!

&gt;Can't wait for payday to see the finished product-in fact how much $$$ do
&gt;you need to help finish this baby off?

I need about $100 for tires and maybe at best $35 for inspection and other 
little stuff.

I'll try and sum up all the costs at the end and post some pictures.
