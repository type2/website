Subject: Re: [VB] re:door scrapers

If anybody else is having trouble with the repro replacements and a sticking
door............. just wipe some baby or talcum powder on it. Sticking door
problem solved quite quickly.......but have to reapply occasionally. This
was a tip in the old owners manual I believe somewhere, for even the stock
rubber door scrapers that also caused sticking from time to time.

Also have to make sure window assembly with this rubber is properly fitted
to the door and door opening.

    The problem with the replacement
&gt; ones being repro'd are that they are TOO STIFF, sometimes causing some
&gt; difficulty in opening said doors.
