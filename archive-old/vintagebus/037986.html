Subject: Painting (lot's of questions)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Time is growing ever so near now for the floors and a couple dime size dents 
to be fixed.  Ordering the Glassurit SWR and CB for the 57 deluxe should be 
taking place in the next month or so.  This is a father/son project with me 
(the son of course) having to do all the research, mechanical work, etc...The 
biggest question that comes to my mind at this time would be what color to 
paint the undercarriage?  I have seen alot of OVER RESTORED busses that are 
painted SWR under there but have never been able to get a respectible answer 
about it.  I remember hearing from some one on the list that the bottom was 
left in primer??  

So paint or primer?

Also I remember hearing that the front shocks were black as the rear ones 
were gray?  True?  Gotta please those Vintage NAZIS you know! =)

Now for the final question.  I think you can answer this one for me thom....
How much paint would it take to paint the bus in the SWR the same way as the 
factory?  How much CB?

Thanks for all the help!  I should really get the pics developed huh?  Oh 
well I will this weekend.
