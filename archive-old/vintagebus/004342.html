Is anyone out there going to the NOPI show in Atlanta?  My hubby and I
are going so he can enter his '93 Stealth, but I found an ad in VW
Trends about the same show and it advertises *14 air-cooled VW*
classes, so now I'm REALLY excited! :-)  Has anyone been to one of
these NOPI shows? I'm very sure there'll be TONS of those cars with
wheels out to there and neon everywhere, AND those ones that hop up
and down (EEEEK!) but we're into the Euros and OF COURSE the VW's, so
if anyone's going, we'd love to meet ya!  P-mail me! :-)
