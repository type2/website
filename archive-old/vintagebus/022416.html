Sad indeed...


&gt;I just got this sad news.

&gt; &gt; To All:
&gt; &gt;     Some very sad news in the VW world.  I just found out from friends in
&gt; &gt; Germany that Heinz-Willi Lottermann passed away.  As most of you know, Mr.
&gt; &gt; Lottermann of Bad Camberg, Germany, graciously hosted and superbly
&gt; &gt; organized an international gathering of VW's from all over the world every
&gt; &gt; four years.  Just last year, he put on a fantastic show with literally
&gt; &gt; hundreds of old VW bugs, buses, and other specialty cars in attendance.
&gt; &gt; Thousands of people have attended and enjoyed his shows over the last 25
&gt; &gt; years.
&gt; &gt;     But not only was he a true VW enthusiast, he was a real gentlemen.
&gt; &gt; When my wife and I introduced ourselves to him at his VW dealership at Bad
&gt; &gt; Camberg last year, in spite of all the activities going on, he took the
&gt; &gt; time to warmly welcome us and then treated us like we were old friends.
&gt; &gt; Just a great guy.
&gt; &gt;     Our prayers go out to him and his family.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Respectfully,
&gt; &gt; Dan Arena
