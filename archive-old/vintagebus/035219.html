Hey, I've been off the  list for a little while (divorce, work, US Navy etc) but I just got back on. Now check this out. I'm in VF103, we're the world famous Jolly Rogers. if you've ever seen Top Gun you'll know what an F-14 looks like; we fly the same type of fighter. Maverick and all that stuff. Well, I was sitting in the shop the other day and one of our Pilots comes in and says &quot;Hey I hear you're the bus guy&quot; So I told him I knew a little about them (I've been in busses for about 10 years). Well it turns out they bought a 66 Westy that they're putting together for our squadron. It's Gloss black with a HUGE skull and cross bones on the sides and various other Navy stuff inside (ejection seat handles, pilot wings on the drivers' seat, RIO wings on the passenger seat, and stuff like that). Well, now we're really famous around the base here at NAS Oceana in Va Beach VA. It's the weirdest thing, I like to drive an old bus, but I never expected to have a bus that can now go down!
 in history. I know all you guys in CA see busses all the time, but out here on the east coast they're pretty rare. Not to mention that all the other squadrons have like these HUGE school busses or F*rd Torinos with their squadron insignia on the sides, but we have a BUS. I'm planning on taking it to Manassas in Sept. for the maiden voyage for more than 50 miles. I do need a few parts though. If you have something to donate to us let me know. If you have a shop, we'll put one of your stickers or paint your logo on it somewhere. we're just poor Navy squids that really don't have a lot of money and we're trying to put together a squadron ride that stands out. I'll try to get a digital camera soon to take some pictures so you can see what I'm talking about. This is actually a bus that stands for something, so try to help us. Plus I got another one back on the road (that's gotta be worth something). Let me know what you guys think. If you were ever in the military and want more in!
fo e-mail me directly or call me at (757)490-9650.
Later,
