Subject: Tranny formula
Mime-Version: 1.0

Here is the formula I used in the calculations:

[(tire dia)x(rpm)]/[(r&amp;p)x(4th gear)x(red. gear)x(336)]=speed in mph

I used 26.5 as the diameter in the example because that is close to 
what a 205/75R15 is, which Clara used in her example.  While that 
size is close to stock diameter, it is wide as hell and causes more 
rolling resistance than stock size tires.

The stock tire for 1955-early 1964 is 6.40-15 bias ply (27.16&quot;)
The stock tire for 1964-67 is 7.00-14 bias ply (26.22&quot;)
