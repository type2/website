Hi Rich,
Does the oil smell like engine oil or tranny oil?  If it smells like sulfur 
it is tranny oil and most likely the seal around the input shaft has failed.  
Is your sump plate warped due to over torquing?  If overtorqued you need to 
remove sump plate and straighten it with a hammer and a flat surface like an 
anvil.  Install new paper sump gaskets and retorque to proper 6 foot Lbs..
  We recently finally fixed our engine from oil marking its parking spot!  We 
polished the bore the FW seal seats into the engine case with 400 grit sand 
paper and drilled an extra oil drain hole for #1 bearing/FW area in the 
engine case so as to not allow a pool of engine oil to be higher than the 
lowest inner edge of the FW seal when the engine is shut down.  This lower 
drain hole for the #1 bearing area has been done at the factory on some 
Brazilian engine cases already.  Results since then for us so far have been 
no oil drippage when we park .
