I removed the belly pan on my 67 westy today so that i could remove the MC.
all the screws were frozen and i had a heck of a time dodging all the fust
flakes ,ancient dirt , and chunks of rat nest, I figure it hasnt been
removed since the last ice age.    It is missing some metal and i would like
a replacement. Considering how hard they arew to fins I thought of casting a
molld and reproducing a fibreglass replacement.  I figure that while I have
a mold i could make a few more. Would this be something that the people
would be interested in?    If so contact me Innes_at_clickcom_dot_com
