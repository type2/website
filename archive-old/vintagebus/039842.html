Hello List,

I have just been put in charge of a local Car Show and Swap Meet.  The show 
is held by the local Lions Club to raise money for the needy in the area.  
In the recent past this car show has not been able to get a large gathering 
of Ch#vy and F*rd fans....  So, I plan to show them who the real car lovers 
are and have added 4 new classes strictly for Volkswagens.  If the car show 
is warmly greeted by the VW community I will be able to increase the classes 
for the Volkswagen group to eventually be a VW only car show.

To help spur interest and to allow VW lovers from far away lands to 
attend... I have opened my house (or rather property) to a campout and bon 
fire the night before.

Anyway... to make a long story short, you can view the show flyer at 
www.VeeDubShop_dot_com or send me a p-mail and I can send you a Adobe Acrobat 
PDF of the flyer.

The details of the show are as follows.

Location:  Elba Lions Hall Grounds
City:  Elba, MI  (Near Lapeer, MI -- Between Flint and Port Huron just off 
of I-69)
Date:  July 8th 2001  Campout: July 7th 2001

If you are intested please let me know so I can cater to the VW interest.  
If there is a desire for a more organized VW Campout let me know and I can 
look into local camp areas and plan that also.

Don't let California croud have all the fun...  Let's show them the Midwest 
can have fun also...  :)

Thanks and hope to hear from you...
Mike
