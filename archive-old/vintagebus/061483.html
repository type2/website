&gt; i have a '66 Westy and my light doesnt have any holes in the lense... the
&gt; push button switch is mounted on the right side?? is this because my
&gt; interior is a euro-delivery? odd that the lights would be different tho.

My 66 so-44 also doesnt have a hole in the lense, the switch is mounted to
(and through) the metal part of the light housing on the side.  The other
two holes are also missing.

Of course, mine is also a euro delivered bus. I havent ever looked at the
light that close on an so-42...hmm.
