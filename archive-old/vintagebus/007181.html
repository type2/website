Hi,

I have some experience with installing friction modifier stuff into an
old tranee. The darned thing started popping out of 4th gear within 10
miles. The stuff was too slippery. However, using a friction modifier
in a new or newly rebuilt trannee worked just great. It ran quieter
and presumably cooler too. good luck with your noisy unit.

Chris

&gt; So I was paying so much attention at Pep Boys to the GL rating
&quot;gotta get
&gt; the GL-4, not GL-5&quot; trip that I plum forgot to get the right
weight.....does
&gt; this mean that I must take the SAE 140 weight and get some 90-w?
What's it
&gt; all mean, anyway?
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking that the hard-to-shift, howling tranny in our new '66
Westy may
&gt; be able to be helped with new shifter bushings, possibly new front
and rear
&gt; tranny mounts, and Slick 50 tranny glop.  (Hey, it worked in my old
&gt; 280Z.....when the mech drained my tranny oil, chunks of bearing race
came
&gt; out.....I ignored his strong recommendation to buy the ZX tranny he
had for
&gt; sale ASAP and stuck some Slick 50 tranny stuff in....I drove that
thing like
&gt; a Z should be driven for several years, and it howled and shifted
funny when
&gt; I got it.....but those problems went away!!!)  So, I try this with
bus
&gt; tranny....if it no work, well, what did I lose?  I'll probably end
up
&gt; getting the tranny and RGB's rebuilt eventually anyway.....
&gt;
&gt; I do love that bus....that motor really rocks!  (WAY better than
that '81
&gt; Vanagon Westy I have for sale!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Gene
&gt;
&gt; anyone want to buy an '81 Westy?
&gt;
&gt;
