I had my '63 DC soda blasted last Fall.  The  shop sandblasted the
interior for some reason. The soda'd outside came out very smooth, the
original swirl marks from the factory spot-weld-clean-up were clearly
visible around the wheel wells and other joins.  The surface was
smoooooth. In contrast, the interior had a lot of 'tooth' and was not
smooth. No doubt the new paint had more surface to grab on the rough
interior surfaces, if that makes a difference in longevity. From the few
soda blasting sites I looked at, they claim that soda leaves less
surface area and the metal is mechanically and chemically less prone to
rust before primer and paint.
The gas tank bay had pounds of sand in it, drifts of very fine sand
around and on the tank.  Looked like the PO had hauled sand before
filling in the bed wood strip holes. No way that much sand came from the
interior sand blasting, unless it was a PO thing.
There was a LOT of soda on the under-carriage considering it was not
blasted under there. The 10 year old appearing undercoating was white
with soda. I sprayed water for a good 20-30 minutes all around before it
started to run clear. The repaired rockers had sand and soda both, and I
washed out the interior before tarring the undercab &amp; interior walls.
Will hit the rockers and heat tubes with compressed air to blow out
straggler grains.
I'll recommend soda over sand, plastic, or walnut shells. It's water
soluble, inert and should be a cheap, earth-friendly media. If any is
left in my DC, my forgotten lunch bags won't smell!
