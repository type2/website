roger nang and i will be leaving the san jose area thursday evening after we our respective work days end.  i appears that we'll be leaving here about 8 or 9pm and driving until we can't stand it anymore.  i doubt that either of us will be able to make the 12 hour drive straight through without the need for sleep especially after a full day's work.  i figure we'll be stopping to rest somewhere near paso robles if we travel 101 to 46 or that big truck stop on 5 if we go that way and again somewhere near barstow.  i'll be in my blue '56 single cab and he'll be in his green/white '67 deluxe.  if anyone would like to join our modest caravan, you'd be welcome.  projected travel speed is about 60mph.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
