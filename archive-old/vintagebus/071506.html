Subject: Engine sealant-found some good stuff

Hey all,

I know everyone probably has thier favorite sealants, but I thought I would
let you know about one I tried out last weekend.

We carry &quot;Curil T&quot; at my work, and although I have about 4 half used tubes of
RTV and a couple cans of various sealants like Gasgacinch, Permatex, etc, I
figured what the hell, and gave it a try.

This stuff was awesome. It has the consistancy of toothpaste (even looks like
green toothpaste), and smells like aftershave. It was interesting stuff. It
never hardens, always stays soft. I used it on everything on my engine.I even
put it on my pushrod tubes, which worked out great for holding them inplace
while I put the heads on. No gaskets between the case and the deep sump, or
the deep sump and the oil plate. I resurfaced my full flow oil pump cover, and
used a very thin film of sealant between the pump and the pump cover. No leaks
at all. Generator stand and fuel pump too. It worked very well.

I accidentally stuck my sump on before I needed to, and had to pull it off.
The sump came back off easily, and the Curil T cleaned off like butta'. I
think when this motor needs to be pulled down next time, cleaning all the
sealant off is going to be a breeze.

If anyone is looking to try a new sealant on thier next motor assembly, give
this stuff a shot, I impressed me! I used it sparingly to minimize the stuff
from sqeezing out when things were tightened down. I can see several engine
builds being done with one tube.
