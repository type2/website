Subject:  RE: [VB] Some measurements for you to chaw on.
Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 16:02:33 +1030 

Your mismatched deck heights could be rod
length and/or piston heights.  I understand your reluctance
to pull the engine down to check the rod lengths etc
but there are a coupla things you can do to help your
volumetric balance.

(1) Pull the pistons back off the rods. Put the one piston on all
four rods and check the deck heights - this will give you the relative
differences caused by rod length or case seats. Check the piston
heights (from wrist pin to crown).  If the piston heights are different
can you arrange things to reduce the deck height differences?

(2) If the pistons are the same height you can always
 have a bit machined off each off each of the tops
(soft jawed lathe to avoid marking them up) so that your deck heights
are now equal.  Hog out the heads so they are more even in volume.

Have a pen and paper handy - cos in all this balancing dilemma don't forget
well balanced is useless if you get the compression ratio too high
or two low.   Try step 1 and work out what the CR will be.  Before going
the route of step 2 work out what your CR will be if you lower ALL the deck
heights
to the same as the lowest AND open up all your heads so ALL equal the
largest...

Best solution may be step 1 with a light hogging out of the smallest
cc head......It's just time and brain energy.  Step 1 is free and even Step
2 shouldn't cost
all that much at all.

good luck

&gt; Here are the cc measurements for the heads:
&gt; 
&gt; #1 - 49.5cc
&gt; #2 - 53cc
&gt; #3 - 54.5cc
&gt; #4 - 54cc
&gt; 
&gt; Each cylinder was checked 5 to 10 times and this
&gt; was by far the number that came up the most often on the calipers.  This
&gt; points to either a rottenly machined case or rods of different length as
&gt; the
&gt; culprit in my mismatched deck heights.  I absolutely refuse to tear the
&gt; engine apart at this point to check rod lengths and all that crap.
