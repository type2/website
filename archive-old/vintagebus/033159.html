    Started really getting into the 57 this week and things arent looking too 
bad.  I noticed that the rear corners are a little bent out of shape, 
portions patched due to rust and filled/smoothed with a cr_at_p load of filler.  
Got most of that off tonight and looks like an easy repair.  They didnt hack 
on the seam at the engine compartment opening.  The passenger side rocker 
defenately needs to go but that will be purchased new as well as the cargo 
floors.  Noticed that the rear jack support on the passenger side is gone as 
well as the rail next to it.  That too will be purchased new.  

    The divider behind the front seats has some damage due to a previous 
owner hacking up a patch job to fix some rust.  Whatever.  So i need to find 
a donor and get these pieces ready.
 
Needed:

    looking for two rear corners
    lower from decklid opening to wheel well 10&quot; high from the bottom

Also Wanted:

    pictures of the mounting holes (square i believe) for 1957 reflectors

    Lower cargo door sections, the bottoms inside are rusted out, need  
approximately 4&quot; to work with from the bottom of the door for both.

    I will get pictures up as soon as i can, hopefully this wekend.  If 
anyone has or knows of some donor busses Pmail me.  If i cant get at one 
locally I can pay someone to locate, cut and ship.
