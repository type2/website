Porsche wiper blades have the extra little arms on them, like a bugs, to
help them curve to the windshield, unless he is useing pre A blades which
are the same as an early bug. Talk about pricey, original Porsche blades
cost almost twice as much as original SWF bus blades, we are talking 67 and
earlier. I do have repo blades for 12.00 dollars a piece, powder coated
metal, and good rubber blades. Out here in the heat they seem to last a lot
longer then the SWF that lasted 2 months on my bus before the rubber started
to split on me.
