If you live in California please take the time to check out the above link. 
It provides updates on legislation that will be used to make it harder to 
keep our classics on the road.

NO ON SB1811!!!! - This law will overturn SB42, if this law passes you will 
have to start sending your splitties (and some loafs) to the smog station

If you don't live in California, please have your friends and relatives who 
do cast a vote to help us out. Also keep in mind that other states often use 
California as a model for their smog laws.

Thanks
