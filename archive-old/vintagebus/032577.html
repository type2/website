Subject: RE: [VB] So-called &quot;IRS&quot; rear axle

&gt; yeah, even my bentley says &quot;the rear wheels are sprung independently on
all
&gt; models..&quot;.  ever work in a parts store? try to explain this to joe public,
&gt; and he/she'll be more confused than if you'd have asked &quot;swing axle or
IRS&quot;  it's just easier to differentiate in conversation.
p.s. you spelled independent wrong. thrice.

sorry for the weirdness-this computer is screwy
[...]
&gt; &gt; I beg to differ with many &quot;experts&quot; and with other folks who have been
&gt; &gt; dealing with, working on, and writing about VW's for a long time, BUT a
&gt; &gt; SWING AXLE is--and I repeat IS-- an Independant Rear Suspension, ie.
&gt; &gt; &quot;I.R.S.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is a misnomer at the least and downright misleading to VW neophytes
to
&gt; &gt; call the later double jointed independant rear suspension &quot;IRS&quot;, as if
&gt; &gt; excluding the earlier design from this description.
