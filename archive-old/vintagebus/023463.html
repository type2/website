OK, had some unexplained problems I had to keep retesting for... so archives
were down most of the afternoon and night.  But they are back up... I'm done
playing.

Have some new hardware that hopefully stays up :)  If there are any
problems, please cell phone me at 206 972-7820... I can get someone to work
it out.

Will be on the road tonight and all Friday... driving down to Lake Havasu
City!

Thanks.
