&gt;  As a quick reference of how myuch grease 80 grams is, i'll refer to the

Well, right.  I was only refering to the volume of grease.  The much
larger CV bearing holds, as you mention, a good bit of grease.  Around 60
grams, in fact.  The other  twenty to thirty go into the stub axle or
transmission flange and into the boot.  not much.


What i was pointing out by macking that reference was that 80 grams goes
into (as per the bentley) BOTH the inner and outer bearing, AND the hub of
the front drums.  if you tried to put 80 grams JUST into the bearings, you
would find yourself with a fair amount of excess grease.

And if you use to much, generally, it will get pushed out as the install
the drum on the stub axle.

Back to the point.  The Bentley says to pack the hubs.  VW authorized the
Bentley.  Lacking TSB's to prove NOT to (or revisions to the Bentley
saying the same..)  I shall continue to pack the hub. (as well as
recommend that it be done when questioned.)

later...david(who loves to argue references.  vague generallities dont cut
it. gotta back it up with something!:)
