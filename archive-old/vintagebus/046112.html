Subject: 019 timing and pertronix transplant
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Found a funky blue dizzy today, an 019. I'd like to try it out and see if it 
treats me better than the 009 I'm using now. So I'm wondering if anyone knows 
what to set the timing at using these, also if its possible to use the 
pertronix ignitor from my 009 since they are both mechanical advance. 
thanks
ronnie c.
