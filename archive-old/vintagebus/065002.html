Subject: Magnets - was  Snake oil or real product

I have a BFM on the drain plate in the non-filtered '63 
DC. Need a big screwdriver to remove it at oil change. 
It's twin is on my fridge door and will snap up a bottle 
cap tossed in it's general direction. 

The super magnet site mentioned earlier is a good source 
if you don't have access to a pile of old hard drives. I 
use 'em on the engine stand to hold nuts and bolts. 
Epoxy one in a 1.5&quot; pvc pipe &amp; end cap to pick up parts. 
Slide up the pipe to remove. Dip 'em in that vinyl 
handle coating to reduce scratching and sliding. They'll 
hold a cover on your windshield at night. They could 
change guage readings on your dash. 

Other misc. stuff. Karl and I tore into my '79 Westy 
last weekend. A bit more complex a job than a T2, but 
his method can be done on a driveway with ramps in less 
than an hour. You need the 15mm swivel socket to get the 
upper tranny mount bolts. See the Type2 archives for 
details. This engine has a dropped valve seat. The 
nearly new junkyard heads cost me less than the gasket 
kit, thermostat and misc. boots cost. 

If anybody has an opinion, should I reinstall the 
seemingly good York compressor or spring for the newer 
rotary? This bus will probably be sold off, so it's a 
marketing decision.

&gt; I have an idea that these magnets might also be handy for mounting small
&gt; items (cup holders, etc) to the dash without drilling holes - just bolt
&gt; the magnet onto the item via the holes in the mounting plate and stick
&gt; it on the dash.  Maybe put a piece of paper over the magnet first so as
&gt; not to scratch the paint.  Note that if you have a wreck, the forces
&gt; involved may well overcome the magnet and send stuff flying.
