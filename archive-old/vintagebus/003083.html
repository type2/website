&gt;Convex, concave, whatever.

it&quot;s easy to remember... concave goes in like a cave... convex is the other
way.
dished is in. domed is out. technically, lifters are domed... idiosyncratic
point though.

Fact is, when 2 rockers are put together, cam
&gt;side to cam side - they should rock around a little bit.  Mine lay flat and
&gt;a straight-edge confirms this.


the first set of lifters i ever bought was reground... what a joke they
were. i have since stuck with new lifters only.
    Barrett ought to make hasty reparations for this waste of your time,
including an immediate RO #... a return authorization which i believe means
that you don't have to pay return shipping at all.
    If all else fails, your credit card company *will* go to bat for you in
this dispute... the parts weren't what they were purported to be. that is
within a hair or two of mail fraud... not that bad but still bad.
    If I was in a particular mindset, I'd demand that *all* of the parts be
returned... you can decide whether or not you want to return the heads. You
can still lower your engine's compression with shims or spacers beneath the
cylinders although the sheet metal fitting is a little trickier.
    If your CC company knows that you altered the bad heads with machine
work after receiving them, they won't try to get the money back for those, I
think... your choice what to tell them. Shoot... a coat of silver paint and
they'll never know what happened, right? ;)
    Barrett needs to eat this one entirely IMHO.
