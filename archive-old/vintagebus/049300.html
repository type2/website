&gt;Buses are *NOT* cheap any more.

They're Porsche cheap for sure. They're H*nda cheap too. I tried to change the starter on the SO's '86 H*nda a few years back because the dealer wanted $350 for the job. Jacked it up, slid underneath... no starter. It's up on top somewhere. Pull it off and get a rebuilt for $85. Put it in and arm torque it. Locked up engine. Long story short, I broke the manual transmission housing. $950 later a non-dealer shop swapped in a salvaged transmission housing and fixed it. Auto trannys from the mid-80's are $3,000 to fix. 

Everett.... just a tip... stop trying to date cargo mats. They don't appreciate it and never call back. They don't even have websites.

General tip on politics... If your political views are validated by a mass market radio network owned by very large corporations, consider the source. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

Anybody heading toward central CA for the Spring Fling this weekend? I'm in the AIRS and the phone book and will consider it a personal insult if you don't call or drop by  if you're in Fresno Saturday. 559-268-8990. Stop and say hello at my orange/yellow DC on Sunday. Karl will be in a goat-vomit green '77 Westy or blue/white 13 window nearby.
