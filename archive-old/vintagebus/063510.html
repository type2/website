Yup, it's the cloth covered official VW-type fuel line.

I just made up a web page showing my fuel line solution which minimizes
fuel-line related engine fires, and eliminates the fuel line connection
hassles when removing/installing the engine (fuel line attaches up at
carburator only, no more spilling fuel in your eyes underneath the bus).

You may check out the installation, which is over ten years old, at:
