&gt; &lt;&lt; i have an ORIGINAL vented cap of the same design, and plan on taking

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; The problem is that the vented gas caps are more complicated than that.  We 
&gt; disected a heavily damaged VW bus gas cap  There is not one but two spiral 
&gt; tubes made of sandwiched plates of brass to help prevent the liquid fuel from 
&gt; spewing out, but allowing vapor out while parked, and air into the tank when 
&gt; the engine is running.   Eric&amp;Barb
Well,

it looks to me as if these two castings are the same. I/E the vented gas
cap i have and the non vented one at autozone are identical, just the
vented one i have was an option from the gas cap MFG that is no longer
available.

That is why i will take them apart.  If the guts are the same, it will be
a matter of opening a vent hole in the same way the vented one has.  If
the internals are different, then it will be more complex.

What applies to stock VW caps may not apply to aftermarket..

take care,

Steve
