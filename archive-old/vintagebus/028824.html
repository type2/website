Subject: leaky seals, Re: tranny output shaft seal
References: &lt;3.0.6.32.20000705220359.0089bcf0_at_pop.snet_dot_net&gt;

the way i see it, there are a few possibilities besides a bad seal...
&quot;bad seal!..... bad!&quot;...
assuming that we're talking about the input shaft and not a stub axle/axle
shaft/etc...

A. the needle bearings inside the gland nut are worn... mayhaps the end of the
input shaft as well... these are what support the end of the input shaft and
hold it in place. if it's worn out, the seal *will* leak as the input shaft
walks around... could also be caused by bad input shaft support bearing down
the line transaxle-wise... but this is a remote possibility.
*many* people misinterpret a leaky seal as being caused simply by a bad seal..
when often there are other tolerances out of range in the inner workings of
things.

B. there is a groove in your input shaft... when you remove the seal, inspect
the corresponding sealing area on the input shaft... on hi-miles trannies,
expect a groove worn into the metal... *prevents proper sealing... either
install seal not as much in, or further in than it was before, to sidestep this
problem... true fix is new seal on new input shaft, restoring all to like new
condition...&lt;smile&gt;
leaks here can also be caused by scratches on shaft due to implements of seal
destruction... scratches on the right place in seal bore in tranny will exhibit
similar tendencies.

C. installation.... must be careful. i made a special drift to do the input
shaft seals... square tubing and the right-sized washer welded on end, centered
with tube... tranny oil on seal inside bore &amp; on input shaft... tap tap tap.
strong arm techniques can mess up the
reinforcing metal that provides inner seal support... seal on straight, not
cocked to one side. if the seal is a family heirloom from the
great-great-greats to you... best to spare it the indignity of installation and
find something of a more recent vintage...

&gt; All this talk of seals.  Replaced the output shaft seal when I put the new
&gt; engine in, still leaked.  The 'new' one didn;t feel soft, but we were about
&gt; to head off on vacation. It still leaks.  So who has the best seals?  Jim
