Subject: Bugorama pages up.

In case anyone that didn't make it wanted a _glimpse_ of the Bugorama that
just happened, I put together a photo-album of sorts for folks to peruse
through to get an idea what the shows like.  Nothing fancy.  No ads, links
or banners (except for the funky counter, anyone know how to make your own
counter?) I didn't realize I'd taken so many pics of type1s until I put the
pages up.  I did try to get something for every type (except typeIV and
waterpumpers).  So have a look already.  Let me know what you think.
