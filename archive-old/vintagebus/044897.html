Subject: Re: [VB] What do you know about Kamper Kits?
To: taylorvw_at_redshift_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

That is that camper with the red vinyl cushions with white piping isnt it?   
I have a couple of those cushions- the rear ones, if someone is interested.   
bus has matching front seats too.  But it needs seats.  hey the kamper kit 
was gone, maybe it was a Kamper Kit camper too.  Maybe I should check the M 
code tag and see if it was sent to San Francisco, what is that code for SF?   
F?  It has older white/green plates, but don't think they are correct for the 
year the bus was made, so it could have been a california car.  It has that 
foam stuff stuck to the walls and ceiling, you know the stuff that acts like 
a sponge to rust the bus.

&lt;&lt; On a whim I took out my roof panels in the camper today.  They were really
 starting to show their age, sagging in places and so forth.  So I'm
 stacking things gently in the backyard when I notice things written on the
 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 48&quot; support pieces (of wood).  It's hard to describe how the 2nd
 owner set this up...it's a rather lame job (weak dark wood, etc).  Anyway,
 when I set two pieces together and can make out in handwriting:
 
 Kamper Kits
 Monta Vista, CA   &lt;-- it's near Cupertino, CA
 
 And another piece has the address for HEHR MfG. Company (they're the guys
 who make all the windows in our campers).
 
 So maybe...just maybe, I don't have a Riviera at all.  Or I do and the 2nd
 owner got a new interior from Kamper Kits!  Sadly, I've found ZERO info on
 Kamper Kits at type2_dot_com
 
 Ahhhh, the mystery grows deeper each day!
