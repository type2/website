Hi all, thanks for the great replies...

To clear up some confusion:
- I have to drill a hole for a stud to go through, no tapping neccecary...

- I dont even know the proper metric size to use... it would seem obvious,
but there is probably a specified size and thats what i want to know.  If
need be i will buy a metric bit.  I guess i can just measure my 67
transaxle nosecone... that is probably the best idea...

- Is this conversion even advisable?  i am figuring it is a good idea
because if i break a trans mount in BFE i will be looking for the more
readily available part, plus it will be a stronger part (unless they
beefed up the later nosecone when they made the holes bigger????)

thanks again to all you wonderful and helpful list folks :)

take care,

Steve
