Subject: Re: [VB] Starter bushing woes

Hi Michael,
You need a drift not a tap when putting the bushing back in.  You could make 
a drift out of a bolt with a shaft near the ID size of the bushing.  A nut on 
the bolt will act as a shoulder to push on the bushing while you hammer on 
the head, though in some cases you might also need to use a washer to help 
spead the press in pressure over the bushing more evenly.  Personally we 
would just remove the engine and check everything else out around the tranny 
whilst down in there.   Eric&amp;Barb
