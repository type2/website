&gt;They were last checked when I put the engine in about 4 months ago. &lt;

Have you retorqued the heads?  I am assuming some engine work was done to
take the motor out in the first place..?  

I think after about 200-400 miles after the heads are taken off and put back
on for any reason they will need to be retorqued to factory specs...  I
think 25ft/lb, check in the Tom Wilson book for the right spec.

Also you may want to check your valves more regularly while breaking in an
engine just to make sure they are not getting tight... Loose no big deal,
tight is very bad if left uncorrected.  Spec should be .006&quot; or .15mm
depending on your gauge.  Do not use an unknown gauge because it could be
.004&quot; which is Porsche spec and too tight....  I know someone is going to
bring up that some intakes can run .004&quot;!  For 99% of the VW engines .006&quot;
is perfect for intake and exhaust.

Good Luck,
