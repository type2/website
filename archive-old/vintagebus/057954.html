Subject: Horn repair?

I thought a while back someone wrote up a horn resto post....or am I
just dreaming?

My horn stopped working on my '62 so I pulled it apart to try and fix
it.  All looked like it should I guess since the Bentley and my original
VW transporter manual (through 62) don't show any procedure for fixing
it.  I tried the one off the 65 but it was a no go also.  Finally found
a beetle one that works reallllly loud....must be 6v.  I want to fix the
original one.

Anyone have ideas procedures??

Thanks.

Steve
