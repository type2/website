Subject: kingpin/linkpin

so i tightened the linkpins as per Muir - when i now push at 12:00 and
6:00 should there be absolutly no movement at all - or is movement that
is measured in millimetres (or do americans spell it millimeters :))
normal - seems to me that the left is exactly the same as before i
started - an incredibly small amount of play - so small in fact that i
had to push a few times just to notice it -

thanks
jdd
