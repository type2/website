&gt; I got this message regarding my quest for parts.  I was expecting to pay,
but wasn't prepared for *this* much.  Or am I suffering a rare instance of
cheepness? Note they haven't qualified the condition of the parts, either.

WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND A
 THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT
THE BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.
&gt;
I've seen a driver's corner for $150 within the past year, rust free and
pretty straight, included a splash pan too.  There was a passenger rear
corner at the classic 2 years back for at least $200, it needed minor work
and blasting but was pretty rust free.  In the past, I've seen a Barndoor
nose from the windshield down for $500, it was blasted, straightened and in
primer.

If a single Bus has all that, why is it being cut up?

Condition was not mentioned so assume it's garbage.
