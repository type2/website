Hi,

This may be a bit of work, but after inspecting my hinges, I
find that the pins are quite undersize. if you can
drill/ream out the hinge piece that is on the door side, you
could press in a bushing that really fits the hinge pin.
Bushing on the bottom hinge will raise the door  around 1/8
to 3/16 of an at the latch end.

&gt; Ran into a fun one last night.  I had some some tweaking
on the passenger
&gt; door, until it fit *perfectly* - it was a thing of beauty.
Until
&gt; I installed the window assembly last night.  Now it sags -
badly.  It looks
&gt; like I'm going to have to do the welding trick like I did
on the driver's
&gt; side.  Hint: do the tweaking with the window frame
installed - that's
&gt; some significant weight :(  This passenger door has been
nothing but
&gt; problems... (it's the same one with the bubbles)
&gt;
&gt; In other news, I'm installing seals left and right.  Man
that's a lotta
&gt; rubber!  I got my freshly painted locking column installed
without
&gt; scratching it - hint: wrap it in masking paper - and the
steering
&gt; column lock, etc installed.  Tom Mink came over Wed and
did most of
&gt; the wiring work; just have the turn signals to debug and
the
&gt; headlights and dome light to install.  He also &quot;restored&quot;
my trip
&gt; speedo, cleaning up the glass and face, and installing new
idiot light
&gt; colors.
