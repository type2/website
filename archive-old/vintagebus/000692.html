&lt;&lt; Wow -  did that head light switch repair go well.  For some reason there
 was grease in that switch - really dirty - yuck.  Now  it's all cleaned
 and soldered and working like new. (thanks to E&amp;B).
 
 My current concern is the noise that comes from my windshield wiper
 motor.  I'm sure that it is about to give up the ghost.  Is there
 anything that I can do to prolong its life?  It is a 6 volt motor on a
 12 volt bus.  I never run it continually - only intermittently - mostly
 becuase the noise scares me.  But if there is something relatively
 simple that I can do to cut down on the noise and prolong the life of
 that wiper motor then I'd like to do it.
 
 TIA

first getr a voltage drop

second, you dont say what year it is./   if it is 64 or ealier it is easy to 
remove the motor, take the cover off that holds the grease, clean it out and 
repack it with fresh grease.  GREASE IS GOOD.  lube all pivots in the linkage 
when you put it back in the bus.   Oil the pivots that stick through the 
nose, the center should turn w/o the outside moving.   This should quiet the 
motor down

65 and later motors have a big dumb bracket and the pivots are buildt in and 
it is trickier, but grease is always good for moving parts.
