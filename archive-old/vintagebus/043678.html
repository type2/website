&gt;well i got the case apart today, it is no good, would need to bored again
&gt;to be used, and has already been bored...reccomendation, get a new engine.

Suggestion...put your current case up on the shelf for a rainy day.  I
would agree that boring it twice may not be the best but some day we
might be searching for &quot;low mileage&quot; cases that have &quot;only&quot; been bored
twice...

&gt;my original is a 1600 single port, the new ones are dual port, so i
&gt;believe i will need a new carb(the 28 pict won't fit the new manifold)

You can get an adapter for the carb but I recall seeing mixed reviews on
these here on the list.

If your current heads are OK or can be made OK then you might consider
keeping your heads, manifold, and carb and swapping them on to the new
engine.  Then you can sell the new DP heads off the engine to get some
$$ back.

&gt;what do you guys recommend?
&gt;Mileage/reliability is more important than acceleration.

From my admittedly limited knowledge, I'd say a 30 or 31.  But talk
to people who know what they're talking about before listening to me.  :)

Good luck!
