Hi Cris,
The first does not exist since the one and only proto type was not made till 
49.  The radio could be several models made up to 1959.  Steering lock could 
be BD, 1955-66 or 67 only.  Bumper could be either 1959-65ish or 65ish 
through 67 or even 68-71.  Sounds like you need to study up and procure parts 
manuals to take there or at least take a digital camera and quickly post the 
images of parts when you are there.
