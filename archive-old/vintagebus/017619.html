I once met a girl, or should I say she once met me...
(Norwegian Wood, Rubber Soul, Lennon/McCartney, 1966)
-----------------
 I struggled to keep my balance, 1/2 in and 1/2 out of
 my shorts, my two inches of death dangling...

Jesus Jim, this is a family list, no need to talk
about your &quot;member&quot;

one thing though?  Dangling.......what ever happened
to mornig wood?
How does 2&quot; dangle?
-----------------------
Whatever happened to proper spelling? Who said
anything about my member? Did I say two inches of
life? Don't give me any crap, I wore the other ten off
on yo momma before you were born ;-) Should I have
said my &quot;mushroom of love?&quot; You &quot;kids&quot; just wait until
you're past 45... You'll be lucky to be holding your
water. ;-) And DON'T *even* tell me that you don't
know what Rubber Soul is. Kids these days, sheesh! You
are probably deciding whether or not to attend your
reunion for the class of '90. gimme a break! Ooooh,
decisions, decisions!
