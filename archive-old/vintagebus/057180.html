Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

I know exactly how you feel, just ask Wade. When he
unveiled his website and said that all the photos on
it were new and never before seen, I had a prob with
that. Cause I saw some photos that I had taken and
knew that I didn't send in to Wade. Come to find out
that I couldn't even find where on thesamba, or
vintagebus where my images were. Ends up being that I
sent out some pictures to friends for there amusement
or whatever and then someone else contributed it to
Wade's site. I was peaved I guess, but after all and
all, it is no big deal now. It is nice to know that
people think you have good images, maybe in the future
do like they do on ebay and stamp your name across it
in paintshop or something. By the way, check out the
bus page at cyberdorks, almost all the images there
are borrowed.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; We've beat up the topic regarding VWoA and their
&gt; relentless pursuit to keep
&gt; people from infringing their marquee.... I've had
&gt; mixed feelings about this.
&gt; But yesterday and today, two things happened.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  A post was made to this list (and several
&gt; others) asking for pics of
&gt; after market wheels.  I was about to email my web
&gt; page url with my
&gt; collection of wheels and I saw he listed a web site
&gt; so I clicked on it just
&gt; to see... and what do I see on the front page?  An
&gt; image that I've posted a
&gt; few times on the samba in the for sale section of an
&gt; original dealer poster.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Just posted today on thesamba gallery are two
&gt; pictures of my 67 tipper...
&gt; one is the original picture from Bob and the other
&gt; is the picture taken off
&gt; my web page showing the hydraulic pump.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the thing that bothers me the most is both
&gt; of these people never
&gt; emailed to ask permission to *publish* my images
&gt; back on the web nor did
&gt; they reference anything.  Sure, I take images off
&gt; the web and save them on
&gt; my hard drive but I use them exclusively for my own
&gt; reference.  If I ever
&gt; use something I try and contact the person that I
&gt; got the image from to ask
&gt; permission and then I try and reference them in what
&gt; ever I am using the
&gt; image for.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?.... or am I just being a whiner?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; David
