Subject: POR15 or what?

I've seen a lot of posts lately about POR15-ing this and POR15-ing that.
Seems that every guy out there is grabbing this stuff and slapping it all
over their buses. Is it really that great? I think it's OK to POR15  the
frame, underbody, wheel wells and such but paint brake drums? NQ is it
really necessary? Look guys, I'll need a lot of rust help on my bus since
even roof has big circles that look like rust damage that was sand blasted.
I'll need to fix it so what should I use on it? I'm talking about outside of
the shell. Should I just bondo over? use some kind of filler or send down to
bare metal? I'd probably use Naval Jelly before putting filler in but my
question is: Does anybody have other ideas? Did you guys use anything else
except POR15? This stuff might be good, don't deny it but there must be
other ways, other things. Share your ideas with me and other listees. I
thank you for that.

Later,
Andre Hryn
