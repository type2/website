Planning to &quot;extend&quot; your business?  &quot;Shifting gears?&quot;

The answer is simple: make original-looking safaris that don't leak!

The original safaris leaked.  But it's not so much the windoe itself, as
the rubber design.

Does anyone have a set of barndoor safaris installed?  I suspect they
leak less due to the totally different seal config.

&gt; Question for the group.  If someone were to look at reproducing the Safari 
&gt; windows, would it be more important to have them look 100% original or to 
&gt; make some that don't leak?  Please P-mail me, I'll post the findings to the 
&gt; list.
