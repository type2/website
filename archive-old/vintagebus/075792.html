&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; Regarding the retorquing of heads, I am concerned that the head studs are
&gt; pulling out of their threads in the case. I read recently on the list that
&gt; there are case saver studs. How do these work? Do you need to put them in
&gt; when the case is open? Is there a way to install them with engine together?

dave,

If your engine does not have case-savers, then there is a good possibility
that the studs are pulling out of the case. There are no case saver studs,
but there are case savers. Case savers are steel cylinders, threaded both
on the inside (for your studs), and threaded on the outside (usually a
self-tapping metal thread type, but possibly a machine thread requiring a
nut inside. You may be able to install them without splitting the case,
but installing them may introduce metal filings from the case into the
engine, so splitting the case is prolly necessary. If you are really good
at keeping the filings out of the case, you could prolly install them. Use
Loctite (strong) to keep them in the case, and then use the medium Loctite
on the stud threads to keep them in also. Don't over tighten the studs
into the case savers.

Should be an interesting day's work!
