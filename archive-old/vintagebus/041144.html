Another development:

Like stated before, when i turn the driver side drum forward all is ok and
the opposite drum turns in reverse.

BUT, when i turn the drum backwards it turns a little and binds. The
opposite drum spins forward a little.

I tried moving the drum backwards using some muscles when it was binding and
i noticed that the other drum spun forward before the bind but when it hit
it, the passenger drum switched direction and started moving the same
direction (backwards) as I was turning the drivers side drum.

ok, now im getting confused. HELP!
