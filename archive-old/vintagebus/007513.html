The belts in early radial tires would take a definite &quot;set&quot;, conforming to
the corner of the vehicle on which they were installed and the direction of
rotation across the road surface.  The tire manufacturer and vehicle maker
specs usually called for rotating them same side, front to back, but it was
usually better to just leave them alone and forget rotation.

After a few years the tire manufacturers [especially the US companies]
started claiming that belt &quot;set&quot; was no longer a problem and indicated that
using traditional tire rotation patterns/procedures was OK.  This is still
the &quot;official&quot; position of most radial tire manufacturers.  In reality,
however, it's still common for radials to take a &quot;set&quot; so savvy tire stores
will advise that radials only be switched front to back on the same side.

An experienced and reliable local tire outlet claims that at least half the
alignment jobs they get are the result of a radial tire rotation that
switches locations diagonally.  The vehicle starts pulling to one side, even
though the alignment checks out on specs.  The simple solution in most of
these cases is to swap the sides of the front tires.

In severe cases of belt set there's no choice but to put the tires back at
their original locations, or replace them with new tires.  The manufacturers
seldom treat belt set as a &quot;defect&quot;, and thus won't cover replacement under
their warranty.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Everything i've ever heard says dont rotate tires on swingaxle cars
front to rear.  Due to the geometry of the rear suspension the tires wear so
differently that its just a bad idea..  &lt;&lt;
