Subject: Engine dies....fuel problem?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Tried to take my Kombi for a drive down the street, and it died on me. I
couldn't get it to stay running. It seems like it either isn't getting
enough fuel or maybe too much fuel or something. I'm gonna let it cool down
and see if I can get it running again enough to drive it back home.
So....if it wasn't doing it before, and it's doing it now, do you think
I've got junk in the line, filter, or carb? Or does this sound like
something else. It didn't do it until the engine was warmed up, and even
then it had been running for a little bit. It seems to have enough fuel as
well. Any ideas would be appreciated before I get into it.
