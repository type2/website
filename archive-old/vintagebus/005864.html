Hi Everyone,

My '55 SC is coming right along... today I installed a brand new carb from
my collection, along with a timing adjustment, filter change, breather
cleaning..etc.
I loaded all my tools and rode off into the sunset for another adventure.
Ended up going about 40 miles down the coast on a really cool stretch of
A1A. Also drove down some oyster shell roads leading past an old plantation
with slave quarter ruins... really spooky, as it was very dark.
Here's my problem:
The transmission is in need of attention.. the gear shift basically moves in
circles and gears don't really sink into any notch. I was able to locate
gears and drive ok, but now I'm starting to have a big problem with reverse.
Had to push the truck backwards once tonight after trying reserve for about
twenty minutes. When I got home, I tried reverse and got it right away. I
decided to try 1st gear and move forward to try again.. Then 1st was really
hard to find! Finally sunk 1st moved forward and reverse wasn't located once
again. I ended up leaving the truck tonight in hopes someone can tell me
which parts I need and how to adjust?
Thanks guys.

sincerely,


Tom
