OK - how many people always have their belly pans on? I just spent over
an hour refitting the one that came with my 67 westy after replacing the
master cylinder. It obviously had not been on in a while and needed
thread chasing and a lot of re-bending and a slight modification for my
under dash mounted heater and 68+ master cylinder, but it is now on. So,
with a summer/fall only driven vehicle, is it really a plus?

BTW - I had written earlier re: my 67 master cylinder dilemma. I decided
to track down a rebuild kit as well as buy the later model 68+ MC and
adapter ring from Wolfgang. The adapter ring worked great, (though I was
sure to put on some anti-seize onto the bolts because it is aluminum and
I've had a lot of corrosion with steel-to-aluminum situations.
The later model MC fit right on with only a lengthening of the wires to
the second switch and I used my 67 resivoir. My thinking was to have a
later model MC on the bus for ease of parts and replacement and keep the
rebuilt 67 in my tool bag. After a lot of bleeding (don't forget to
bench bleed the MC before installation, I did) the brakes are back in
operation.
