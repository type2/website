There are plenty of posts in the archives on this subject, some written by
me.

However, your account of the seat being cut and upholstery being torn out
sets a new record, I believe, for malicious destruction.  The perpetrators
of such mayhem are usually agents of US Customs.  Canadian Customs officers
tend to be much more civil in their approach.

There is ample documentation of VW buses being disassembled by US Customs
operatives, but your account is the first I've seen of either side's people
actually destroying something.  More typically parts and pieces are removed
with minimal damage to individual components.  You're still left with a big
mess to put back together, but the parts are useable.

I don't know what the protocol would be to make a claim for damages against
Canada, but in your place I'd be burning up the phone to my Congressional
representatives, the Dept. of State, and the Dept. of Justice.  It would
also be prudent to lodge a claim with your insurance company.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; I got stopped as I was crossing over.  Canadian police (Mounties?)
proceeded to tear apart my car looking for drugs presumeably. Ripping off
door panels, opulling up carpet. . .   They even cut the vinyl on my rear
bench seat and ripped the padding out.  After nearly three hours of this and
much protestation on my part they let me on my way.  I proceeded on to
Montreal, and places east.  Then, coming back into the States into Vermont I
was detained again by Canadian authorities, asked to remove all of my
belongins and they once again searched my car.  Fine, whatever...I have
nothing to hide. . .   Two weeks on the road softened the blow of this
harrassment, but I honestly feel that they pegged me because of the Vehicle
I drive.  Has anyone had
similar experiences?  Do I have any recourse for the damage caused,
particularly to my rear bench seat,
which was original.  Can I sue Canada? &lt;&lt;
