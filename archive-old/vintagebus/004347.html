Subject: I need a 15&quot; bus rim (just one.)

In my attempts to get my bus into town so I can start working on on it and
get it running again, I've been searching for some 15&quot; bus rims.  Roger Nang
and I have successfully completed a swap of rims - my mismatched set of 5
powdercoated rims for his 4 - 15&quot; rims.  Although his rims are grungy, they
are great cores that I can blast, add clips to, and get powdercoated.
Unfortunately, the 5th rim, which I had and thought would work, turned out
to be a rusty POS that is rusted beyond help along the bead area - a tire
would never seal on that rim.

So Roger Nang and Ronnie at the OldVolksHome are doing their best to try and
locate a 15&quot; bus rim for me.  But I'm posting this to all of you to see if
anyone has such a beast in their scrap rim and tire pile.  I would prefer a
rim without the tire (but beggars ain't choosers) and if I get lucky, I'd
actually take 2 rims.

I've put a picture up at http://home.ispi_dot_net/bie/elassley/rims01.jpg and
please note that of all the varieties of rims that VW made, these rims have
these traits in particular:

1)  Measures 16&quot; from lip to lip - from tire contact area to tire contact
area is 15&quot; (inside where the bead goes)
2)  Must have provision for hubcap clips (holes for clips but good clips are
not necessary)
3)  4.5 inches wide (lip to lip)
4)  The hub is attatched at 4 points to the rim.  I've seen solid contact
all the way around on some rims but I don't want that kind.  It must look
like the white rim in the lower right of the picture at the URL above.
5)  I prefer no severely ovaled holes.  I can tolerate mild ovalling in 1 or
2 holes but nothing worse than this.

Thanks for helping me in trying to get some good feet on my 66.  After
almost 20 years, it's time to get it back on the road.
I'm willing to pay for shipping (it's surprisingly cheap - $43 for 5 rims
UPS ground (minus tires)) and of course, I don't expect freebies so I'm
willing to talk a little cash if we must.

I told Roger and Ronnie that I was going to ask the list so whoever comes up
with some rims like this, let me know!

Thanks.
