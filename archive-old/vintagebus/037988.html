&lt;&lt; I finally got to the engine compartment and pulled the dipstick and the 
oil looks bright and clear!!! So now, I am planning on pulling the engine. I 
wonder though. . . should I break the engine down?? It is very apparent to me 
that it has been sitting for
 a VERY LONG TIME!! &gt;&gt;
Hi Les,
Yes you really should!  Unless you are psychic who really knows what type of 
work was done?  If the engine was run at all the water vapor from the fuel 
burning probably got into the the engine case and oil causing rust on crank, 
cam, and other parts..  Plus unless the oil was changed just after the engine 
was last shut down the gasolene that got past the rings has turned the oil 
into acid.  Try pulling the dipstick out again and take a sniff.  If it makes 
you eyes want to water like an onion attack it is acidic.  Lastly the oil is 
going to look clear and clean even if it was the filtiest stuff when it was 
shut down even only six months ago due to settling!  Even if detergent oil 
was used the dirt is not going to be held in suspension forever.   Eric&amp;Barb
