Hi Al,
Not certain, but it sounds like you are saying to take off the pitaman arm 
off the right side of the steering box.  If so do not do that!  That way 
leads to binding steering.  What you need to do is to disconnect the one end 
of the drag link and adjust it's length so that the steering is even side to 
side.  Eric&amp;Barb
