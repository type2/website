Hi all,

Does anyone know if Lars Neuffer in Europe is still around?  He owes me two
small parts which were promised to me at the first of January and I haven't
seen them and never get a reply to any of my emails.

If he isn't around, I need one of the little reflector pieces that goes in
front of the bulb on my euro head lamps.


Anybody know?
David
