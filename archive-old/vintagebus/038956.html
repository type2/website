Subject: free stuff-lowered spindle  question.

The free stuff I recieved form Dre was great. It is good to see some part
move like that. Saturday I got free torsion bars with spring plates from a
yard I went too, in very nice shape. Bus even sat right, so I can go without
much tweaking from stock angle. It is good to know that it isn't all about
money here, since I need so much damn stuff, not that I expect to get much
for free.
I wish I had some 'extra' stuff to help out, but perhaps someday...Right now
I am begging yards for OEM bolts and nuts for spares, since I have now extra
fasteners around....
Logistics look like a maiden voyage might be sometime late August, so I
expect Sept... :) I pick up my engine and my trans should be done mid
August. Planning on a crunch then... Right now scrubbing undercarriage (wooo
fun).

Spindle q: Do the lowered spindles require a different tie rod end? I have
Wolfgang ones, and they are going going gone in acouple weeks for a stock
set, jsut want to be well prepared, so I don't wait for parts.
