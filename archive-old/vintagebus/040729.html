&quot;OH THE HUMANITY OF IT&quot; exit the Hindenburg...........

Ahwile back some kind soul reminded us of fires on the road. I have always carried the apparatus in 911's on track and off. The actual sight of ones baby burning is an awful one indeed, imagined or real! In the repair field (bodies) i have seen many a burner resting in the junkie.
So whilst watchin the threads of the list, i noted my concern of the fuel filter mounted above the distrib., such a common practice. Therefore,
realizing how much i loved the silly little bus and the daily driving it now does, A FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS A MUST! Think of that noisy little smoke detector and the batterie changes in ones house, change those and get some piece of mind with a F. EXT. unit mounted in Der Bus. Remember Smokey, &quot;Only you can prevent bus fires!&quot;
