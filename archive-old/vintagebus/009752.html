Subject: Looking for a 1776 long block
Date: Mon, 4 Jun 2001 10:28:05 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My 1600 in my 68 Adventurevagen has bought the farm and I am looking for a
source for a 1776 longblock.  I saw several advertised in the back of hot
veedubs mag ranging from $600-$1000 + core but I don't know about the
quality.  I am curious if anyone knows of a good supplier in the Pacific
Northwest so shipping wouldn't be a problem.  I would be willing to drive to
oregon or idaho.

Please if anyone has any leads, or a spare lying around please contact me
directly as I am not on the vintage bus list, but figured you guys deal more
with the type 1 block than  the bays or vanagons.
