Subject: Looking for some doors for my 66.
Date: Sun, 6 Feb 2000 14:31:18 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I could repair my old doors on my bus, but I really think I'd like to find a
rustfree pair of 66 deluxe doors for my bus.  The trim is not needed ( I
have that already).  I have the guts and glass - just need some doors that
are good and healthy as far a sheet metal and hinges goes.  Anyone have a
set I could drive down and pickup for a reasonable price?  I'm kind of
aiming for the Oklahoma/Texas area but beggars ain't choosers.  I'm in
Beatrice, NE 68310.

And remember - use a torch and parafin to free rusty fasteners!
