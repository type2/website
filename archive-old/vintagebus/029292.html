Subject: Labor Day bus labor

Well, I was out completing a few more things on my list to complete
before I go to Solvang.  Today it was installing the ultra
cool/functional Davis cup holders and fixing my 34 PICT3 flat spot.
Once both of those were completed I got to tinkering with an inspection
light that has been attached to my engine lid.  It's been unhooked since
I bought the bus, so I figured I'd wire it up.

It is installed on the underside top of the engine lid next to the
license light.  I thought that was an odd place until I pulled the
simple light apart (basically a bulb holder with no cover).  Inside the
light to my surprise was a mercury switch.  Its a small glass container
about 1/2 &quot; long with contacts at each end.  A small amount of mercury
sloshes around inside.  When you lift the lid, the mercury makes contact
and the bulb lights.  Put the lid down and the mercury goes to one end
and the light goes out.  Very cool.  All self contained. Works like a
charm.

Are these types of switches still available?  Could this have been
dealer installed or was it an after market &quot;Pep Boys&quot; thing??  This is
on my 62 DC

Steve
