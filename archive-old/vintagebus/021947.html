Subject: aircleaners , bodyparts,and questions  (a bit too long)

Hello Folks
 i am in the beginning stages of restroing a 65 Double Cab. The thing didnt 
come with an engine,so ive since found one and rebuilt it. It is a stock 1600 
DP. With that part finished, i was looking at the aircleaner set up. This 
truck didnt come with anything except what looks to be an oilbath aircleaner 
i found inside the cab. Right now im assuming it is for this truck.My 
question is, what other parts am i missing or atleast where can i find a good 
photo of the complete system? I beleive there is a rubber bootie part i dont 
have but what about metal ductwork? In the engine compartment there is a 
bracket hanging down on the right side:i assume this is somthing that holds 
the aircleaner itself, but i havent a clue as to how it all works...Of course 
i could use an aftermarket paper aircleaner but i want to use the correct 
setup for 65.
There are no other double cabs around here that i know of to look at.
ANY help would be great .
Also, anyone know where i could get a left rear quarterpanel ? Mine has been 
hit and mangled. Id need at, minimum, from the wheel arch all the way back 
around the corner to the engine lid, battery tray included plus about half of 
the inner wheel arch.This whole section looks to be made up of many different 
parts .
 
Who ,in your opinion, makes the best fitting replacement body panels? i.e. 
rockers ,inner/outter ?

This being just a question : When rebuilding my 1600, i installed brandnew 
85.5mm Mahle pistons/cly. These had a friction reducing coating on the 
pistons skirts ,a black teflon coating i beleive, It seemed to have been an 
option from Mahle...has anyone ever seen these and should i have even used 
them? 

anyway,thank you for your time..
