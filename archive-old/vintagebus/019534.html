I'm saddened that nobody's mentioned converting to right-hand-drive :(

&gt; Okey dokey. I have to agree. The limo is not nearly custom enough, so I'm
&gt; converting it to a barndoor walk-thru double-door hardtop deluxe poptop
&gt; Westy. Also have some nice flip seat Westy stuff that might go in there and
&gt; a Dormo top would finish it off nicely. That is going to be a bit of a
&gt; bitch, what with it being a big hatch bus and all, but since I'm not going
&gt; to restore it back into two Westies anyway, why not? Everything in
&gt; moderation I always say.
