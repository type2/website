Subject: barndoor dlux, trip from H#*L

Well my 55 Barndoor Delux is set to arrive tomorrow, it has been on the trip
from H#*l that started last Friday, first it was loaded on the transport to
leave Dallas to be here last weekend (that's why I didn't go to the Prescott
show) when the dispatcher didn't show up to assign the trailer to a driver.
Well on Monday it left Dallas Texas to be here by Wednesday of this week
when a couple of hundred of miles out of Dallas the Semi broke down, that
took two days to fix and get back on the road. Finally the trucks on the
road and am told my Barndoor would be here when I arrive to my shop Friday
morning, arrive to my shop NO BUS, what the F#*K. Call the dispatcher in
Dallas and ask Where's my bus?????, I was told that the truck driver will
call me asap, a few minutes latter I get a call from the truck driver, he
told me he PASSED out at a rest stop outside of Albuquerque and spent the
night in the ER and finally got released this morning to continue his
journey. So as the story goes if anybody is cruising I 40 tonight keep your
eyes opened for my bus, it's loaded on TOP of the 9 car hauler, what a site
that must be and with GOD on my side my bus should be here Saturday morning,
I'm sure excited to finally receive my bus, let's hope nothing else can go
wrong.
