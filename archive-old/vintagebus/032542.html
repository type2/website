 sounds possible, but it is very unusual for a type 1 cam to lose the
rivets, especially if you have a dished cam.  have you checked valve
clearance?  i think when my cam went flat (non hardened, pos brazilian) i
had this problem you described, but i'm not sure.  i had to adjust the
screws about 2 turns just to get them correct.  of course i had to tear the
motor down and rebuild--after only about 1200 miles.  other than that,
don't know what to say without hearing it.  good luck.

&gt; 1600 single port  Aprox 3,000 miles on it.  It was built with
&gt; a new brazilian case, &amp; new heads.
