&gt; &gt; Sulfur and phosphate reactions start at a lower temperature and
&gt; &gt;is corrosive to copper bearings and BRONZE synchro rings.
&gt;
&gt; My synchro rings and  trans bearings are steel. The shift forks are
bronze.

The fork will be steel. It is used to move the sliding gear.
The synchro ring will always be a softer metal than the sliding gear and the
gear you are selecting. Go to Bentley, section H-7, page 8. Look at the pic
of the gear train. Unfortunately they don't show a fork. The synchro rings
are always loosely riding on the taper of each forward gear. [unlike reverse
which has no synchro and you are actually moving a true gear] The fork goes
into the groove of #10. Depending which gear you want, #10 moves left or
right, first contacting the ring #9 or #11. Let's say you are going from 3rd
from 4th. #10 is engaged with #8. The fork moves right and #10 disengages #8
+ #9. It then contacts #11 synchro ring. The ring always sits on the taper
section of #14, 4th gear. As shifting pressure is put on the ring, its job
is to 'synchronize' the speed of the sliding gear #10 to the speed of the
gear #14. #10 1st engages #11, #11 tightens on the taper of #14, #11 and #14
then move at the same speed, #10 then fully engages with #14 = 4th gear.
Ever have a car that grinds going into a gear. i.e. 3rd? And somebody tells
you ''the synchro is worn out''? Actually the synchro RING is worn out. 9
times out of 10, the inside taper of the ring is worn down and can no longer
slow down or speed up the gear it is riding on. The metal [bronze in VW's]
on the inside either wears away or is hardened and looses its friction
property [etched]. Then the speed of the sliding gear and the gear you want
is not 'synchronized' and it grinds.
Does any of this make sense?
