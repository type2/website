Subject: tranny for sale - Bay Area only

Hello all,

The good news:

I have an axle to axle tranny for sale to someone who can pick it up from
me in san francisco.

The questionable news:

It is a Carter's Gearbox tranny, and has 25 miles on it. It whines fairly
prominently, like a truck tranny, in the lower gears, when you are down
shifting. 

I don't know what it's really worth at this point, but at least 250
dollars would prolly be minimum. It cost me 900 plus delivery when he
built it up for me last year. It works, but I just didn't like any whining
sounds in my bus, so I didn't leave it in the vehicle.

I live in the sunset district of san francisco, and wish to get it out of
the garage now. 

Email me if interested, at cjay_at_well_dot_com
