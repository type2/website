Subject: 65 samba progress

Hi all,

Been keeping a low profile for a while.  Thought i might update you all
on how the bus resto is going.

Well, slow.  I have made some progress though.  I just pick up the bus
from the upholster.  I had the headliner and sunroof installed.  What a
great job he did.  I ended up having Dave Lumetta in Sunland do the
job.  He made the whole things from scratch and does all the little
extra's that many people would not do. Things like install all the
trinkets, totally rebuild the sunroof, install all the glass and the
likes.  He also used thicker headliner material then the box job's.  It
last's alot longer and is real strong.  Very thorough.  Anyway,  the bus
looks a whole lot different now.

I also have goten all the engine stuff ready for assembly.  Just need
the case now.

Things that are still to come:
Find some $$$  (Expensive to rebuild these things)
polish all the trim
Make the door panels
Find more $$$  (Part cost &gt; funding)
Strip the seats down and rebuild
Build the engine up
Take out second on house  (i might be able to finish the bus now)
Finish the wiring
Sell the bus to pay for it.  NEVER!!!

Anyway, things are going good.  I will not make the end of the year goal
for driving it, but i am still having fun.

Matthew
