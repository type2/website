Subject: Re: [VB] reaming swing lever bushings

Some people swear by brake cylinder hones. It takes
longer, but you can get it soooo close that way.

&gt; I'm getting ready to replace the swing lever bushings
&gt; on my bus...wolfsburg west rents a reamer with their
&gt; kit, but it's reserved until late august! So i'm
&gt; thinking about getting my own adjustable reamer...but
&gt; I don't want to spend a lot...Does anybody know what
&gt; size I should look for, and where I might be able to
&gt; get one cheap? ebay doesn't look promising right
&gt; now...or better yet, anybody have a reamer they could
&gt; lend/rent/sell? I've got some goodies I could trade
&gt; for the use of a reamer (pop-out-latches, seat
&gt; brackets, gas guage, 14&quot; wheels, ash tray,
&gt; etc...)thanks,
