In response to inquiries about the meaning of the acronym 'FLAPS', I sent a list of acronyms I have been compiling to the enquirees. The both responded very positively and suggested that this list might be of general interest. It is quite extensive, although by no means 'Compleat'. Some of the terms have fallen into disuse, or may have never actually been used, and new acronyms seem to pop up every day (i.e. AAMOF). I cannot take credit for the entire work, it is a combination of two similar lists I came across, with several additions gleaned from postings on this list. If you want it, here it is. Just send a SASEE (Self Addressed Stamped E-mail Envelope) to the 'reply to author' address on your computer. Sorry, Thom, no OBC in this message. I swear, I won't do it again (soon).
