To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I can't remember if I posted an update, so here goes. 
The idiot book layed it all out. I didn't think to
look in there first. The front tranny mount was one of
the problems. (cause for clunking and other noises).
The second being the mid-section.  I am accually glad
it happened when it did, however. The trans was on its
death bed, so its better it died slowly, rather on the
trip to Jerome.  Ronnie sent out a Ranch 4.12 right
away; smooth sale as allways.  Having the whole rear
end worked on as we speak. Should be ready for Jerome
with no problems.  Thanks to all who posted to my
plea.  Mmmmm...free tacos....See you all this weekend!

P.S  Anyone going to see Phish in Vegas??
