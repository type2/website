Hi Bob,
Sure get rid of the paper air cleaner and get the stock oil bath back on.  If
you really want more air flow the stock air cleaner is better than a single
paper air cleaner.  If you are still interested in easier breathing air
cleaner look for the large heavy duty oil bath air cleaner that could be had
as either a factory M-code or was installed at the dealer.
  As for your second question we would really need more through info on your
engine.  Like engine size, carburator/s, carbuartor jet sizes, muffler,
distributor, and weather that you encounter this problem.   Eric&amp;Barb
