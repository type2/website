Subject: RE: [VB] Call for HELP/AIRS comes through

   Well the AIRS list came through for Kevin. I gave him a bunch of names in
the NY area and one nice bus owner offered his help and driveway. Kevin is
now in Buffalo, NY with his engine out looking for a small diameter 6 volt
generator without the regulator mounted on top.

Subject: [VB] Call for HELP, Rochester, New York


 Kevin Guarnotta [kguarnotta_at_usa_dot_net], known on most list just called me and
is having charging problems in his bus. It is still 6 volt and his generator
light just came on, he is on his way to Canada. He is currently on Hwy 90?
30 miles EAST of Rochester, New York. His belt is OK so it's either his
generator or regulator. If anybody is in the area, he could really use some
help.
