I have a brake problem that I haven't seen addressed directly in the
library...Here's what happens.
Tonight driving back from the office, I noticed at a red light that the
brake pedal wouldn't go down no matter how hard I stepped on it. Soon after
that I smelled something cooking, my driver's side front brake I suspect.
Drag on the bus for the last couple blocks was pretty noticable. This should
be elementary for you veterans, I looked for this condition in the Muir book
but couldn't find it.
Seized wheel cylinder? Collapsed hose? Fried brake shoes?
I've been reading the brake threads the last few days, and agree that this
is no area to experiment with, so I'd like some tips...

next week we'll take a look at the steering.

sounds WAYYYYYYYY overdo for brake inspection.    Ist, look at the brake 
fluid in the reservoir- unde rthe driver feet through the hole in the floor 
with the round cover plate you twirl off.   Any in there?  What colour?  
Should be clear and fairly full but I doubt it is.

Now crawl unde rthe front of the bus and look at the front brake hoses-   
they attach to the wheel  at the backing plate going into ac ylinder that is 
hidden by the drum.   If they have cracks or bulges just be glad they didn't 
burst.   .    Now s a test, have a friend pump the brakes while you open the 
bleeder valve-- fluid should spurt out.  Nada?   Clog somewhere and likely a 
hose.   Check all 4 wheels.   Now go get yourself 4 new brake hoses (have you 
replaced them in the past 5 years? if not they likely need it.) and new front 
wheel cylinders and replace all your hoses and your front cylinders probably 
are bad at least the burnt warped ones that friend from the pressure not 
being able to revert back to the MC reservoir from the internally collased 
hoses so replace all in the front dont be cheap w/ brakes, part are cheaper  
than paying for stuff or sitting in the hospital which isn't fun and replac 
ethe shoes too if they are bad or marginal and if it was smoking they just 
might be you know.    So grease the adjusting stars while you are inthere.   
Clean out the MC with a rag after pumping the old fluid out (I catch mine in 
a coffee can) and when you have the wheels back together flush new fluid 
through the whole system till it comes out clean at each wheel.      

well, this may not be the problem, but it's a good idea to check.

BTW I had a wheel smokin once.   I was out in the Oregon boonies.    and not 
much later the hose burst  and the pedal went all the way to the floor and 
didn' t slow the bus down at all.    Hm.  Hows your hand brake?   I was glad 
mine worked well.   Anyhow, the pressure was always on in my FR wheel, and 
the brakes got hot and starting smoking, I smelled it and my friend stuck his 
head out the window and said there was smoke come from there and I pulled 
over and just the one was hot. 

 Anyway, after taking it apart it turned out the cause was the bad hose, but 
the heat had warped the wheel cylinders.  I ended up getting rebuild kits, 
and filing/sanding the pistons of the cylinders back into round, replacing 
the shoes and the hoses.   All under the tutilage of someone who helped a 
couple strangers traveling in a 30year old VW bus.
