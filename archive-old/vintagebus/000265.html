&lt;&lt; The other goes to an outlet that is supposed to be on your muffler,
 which feeds warm air into the air cleaner to help it run
 better in the cold.  There's supposed to be a paper hose, like
 the fresh-air hoses, between them. &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
Actually this paper hose connects to a steel (About 1&quot; or 25mm dia.)tube 
bolted to the left rear upper muffler pipe, and is held there so this steel 
tube sticks through the left rear tin just behind the head so it can suck 
heat off of #4 cylinder.  During summer when temps are going to above 70F you 
can shut off this preheat system by locking the outer handle of the preheat 
flap in the aircleaner, under the seam on the right of the air inake snout.
By the way Jdd, what size engine are you running?  We can see if we can give 
you the jet sizes for proper jetting for your setup.   Eric&amp;Barb
