Hello Bus Friends,

We are trying to get as many local bus freaks together as we can at
Denny's on Wade Hampton Blvd. on January 8th (Saturday) around 1pm. I
know that there are a lot of bus folk in the area that I still haven't
met, and this would be an opportunity to make new friends for all of
us... This is for all bussers, splitters, bayers, waterboxers, Euros,
etc...

We don't really have a program for this thing, just wanna get some folks
together for fun... Knowing your fellow bus neighbors can be a good
thing...

Someone please forward this to the Vanagon list... (is there a Euro
list?)

david
