Subject: 200mm clutch?
Message-Id: &lt;v04205102b37c6dca4927_at_[209.75.206.201]&gt;

I am missing some of this thread.
I just saw something about 200mm clutches and 6 volt.
I have this.
My flywheel is 6 volt.
My clutch is 200mm.
Flywheel came from a Karmann Ghia...
Don't know what year or anything.
Maybe all Karmann Ghias had 200mm clutches.
Who knows?

Still trying to get some kind soul to send me a pattern
so I can get a rear hatch glass cut for my '62 15 window deluxe.
Still need rear seat back.
Still don't know if I will ever drive it when it is done.
But I don't want to sell it yet.
I would trade for a Eurovan weekender, or a TDI WaterBug.
Yes I am also sitting on a Gold Mine :)

Chris in Sandy Eggo...
'62 Deluxe Beetle 113 (Oli)
'62 Deluxe 15 window 251 (LusBus)
'86 Jetta Diesel (Freeway Car) 51.6 Miles per gallon this week:)
If anyone can suggest a VW Camper that can go at least 70 miles
per hour, I am looking.  I don't know anything about water-cooled
Eurovans and Vanagons.  Help would be nice.

No, the '62 15 window is not something I would drive.
Six months of looking for that damned back glass. Still can't find one.
You think I would take it out of the garage and risk something happening to it?
I always wanted a split bus to drive.  But, at more than a grand
a month going into this thing.  I can't afford to ever drive it.
When I hit 10 thousand dollars I quit.
