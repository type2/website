OK I admit it I have to ask the class a dumb question.

I picked up a m-plate at a swap last year for a quarter and just found it in a
drawer.  I went to put it in Thom's registry but was stymied by the date.   The
first line is    08 N  .  I can guess that it is November 8, but what year would
&quot;0&quot; be??  '60??

Based on this:

&quot;Until 1963, this was a 5-digit number, using the European day/month/year
standard. After 63, they switched to a 3-digit system, with the first two digits
representing the day, and the second representing the month. 1 through 9 were
used for January through September, with the letter &quot;O&quot; for October, N for
November, and D for December.&quot;

the 3 digit numbering system must be after 63?  Any idea?  I know this is simple
for someone.  I've lost my SSVC booklet.  It explains it in great detail.

Thanks.

Anyone need a Kombi M-code tag??

Steve
