&gt;Subject: [VB] beepy horn at nonbeepy times

Maybe it's just happy to be alive?  :)

&gt;Yes, I HAVE replaced the wire that goes up the column, AND put drinking
&gt;straws down its length :)

There are two ways that your horn can go off without your permission:

1.  Power wire to the horn is OK, and the wire from the horn, up the
    column, to the button is grounding out intermittently.
2.  The wire from the horn to the button is grounded out solid (all
    the time) and the power wire is only working intermittently.

Can you blow the horn with the button whenever you want?  If so, you
probably have (1).  If not, you probably have (2).

For (1) the place I'd start is at the ends.  Check under the horn
button and where the wire comes out of the steering box.  At the
end of the steering box, the wire has to make a right turn and go
under a metal bracket, which are two good places for the insulation
to get damaged.  You might even pop off your horn button, put a little
tape around the wire end, and drive around to see if your horn button
might be the culprit.

Another thought - it may be grounding out at the horn.  Make sure your
horn is securely mounted and that there are no dangly pieces of metal
near the horn terminals.

For (2), you have to fix the power wire AND (1).  You'll know it when
you fix the power wire as your horn will will go all the time.  :)
Check for loose wires, bad connections at the fuse box, etc.

&gt;Ways to check for shorts to the column tube?

Assuming that your power wire is in good order, your horn is doing
this already.  :)  Remember, a short to ground in the wire anywhere
from the horn to the button will do this, so don't automatically
go rip apart your steering column.

Good luck!
