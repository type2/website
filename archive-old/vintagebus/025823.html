&gt; My other gripe is that they only cover *pristine* vehicles and not those (or
&gt; few of) that are actually used.  I would like to see more attention paid to
&gt; busses that are drivers

For that kind of coverage you need to be reading VolksWorld. Just a few months
ago they did a feature on Eric Lussiers car, primer sealed, unpainted, big
motor, accessorized, driver. A car the would gather ALL the attention in the
swap area of a show, but the judges would never look at it. That's the kinda car
I like!! In the same article was a similar car that his buddy had
too.........................
