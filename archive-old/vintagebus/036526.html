I just received my birth certificate for my 1959 deluxe and it has &quot;special
painted&quot; for color with no paint code. Has anyone received a birth
certificate for a special painted bus that had a paint code shown? Anyone
know if they have that info in the archives?

My bus was definitely sealing wax red on the bottom and has the word &quot;grau&quot;
written in the RH headlight bucket like my other 1959. The only difference I
can see is the upper color seems to have a lot more gray in the color. 

Unfortunately in the past the upper portion of the seat partition was
removed along with the m-code tag. I would like to restore the bus
eventually with the original colors, but am not sure where to go from here.
