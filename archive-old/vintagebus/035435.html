&lt;&lt; Hi all I'm still dealing with horrible gas mileage. The list of answers 
for 
 my progressive Weber has been short and with few answers. Can I ever get 
 this to be efficient? Or even close? I need advice.  Am I wasting my time 
 with this &quot;performance&quot; Weber STUFF that the PO decided was a good idea? 
 Time is of the essence for me. I am supposed to be leaving for a 900 mile 
 trip in a bit more than a week. I have another car at my disposal but I 
 really wanted to take the bus.  :(
 
 The bus is running like a real champ but not at all effecient.  Would I just 
 be safer and faster dropping the money into a used Solex and new intake 
 manifold? Is a solex setup any closer to a sure fire way to better gas 
 mileage.
 
 Again the facts are
 1600 DP
 32/36 Weber Progressive
 15 mpg in town
 
 Please I need Help!!!!
  &gt;&gt;

what is the milage on the freeway?  probably better than around town.   My 
bus gets better milage on the freeway, though I have driven vws that get the 
same no matter where you drive them.  (59 bus with split case tranny (4.43:1 
r&amp;p, .79 4th, 1.39 RGears, 14&quot; rims)  1500 sp, 28 pict solex got 31mpg- what 
a fluke)  anyway, how about a tune up? nice new plugs and points and 
everything all dialed in there can't but help the milage.  how are your plug 
wires.   I am not big on dual carbs, but many people swear by them and do get 
more than 15mpg with them, when they are adjusted/jetted right.
