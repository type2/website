I'll give this one a go...

Das Bulli Haus will sell you nice replacement front floor pieces.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a theory on the cab floor.  As feet move the mat, it rubs the 
&gt; paint, rust forms, the mat rubs the oxides off exposing more metal,
&gt; and the cycle continues.  This leads to the Swiss cheese look
&gt; so popular amongst busses.
&gt; 

We enjoy that look - proves authenticity.



&gt; The weird rust is that the cargo area floor against the seat
&gt; bulkheads is rusted a bunch.  The belly pans are in great
&gt; shape.  Everything else is in great shape.  To replace this 
&gt; area I'll need about 8 inches of metal back from the seat backs.
&gt; Is this metal available.
&gt; 

I don't recall Das Bulli having this section, but check thier page at
Thom's site.  I salvaged the section from a junker at a yard in LA.


&gt; Are there structural concerns with this flooring missing?

No more than usual - replace it - you'll lose less heat that way. 

&gt; 
&gt; Can this be welded without damaging nearby interior or exterior paint?

If your welder is good, yes.


&gt; 
&gt; What can be done to slow the rust process in the closed
&gt; space between belly pans and floor?

You could undo the welds holding the belly pans on, and check out and seal
up the area. If all is structurally fine, then a sprayed-on coat of POR-15
can protect it near forever. Then button up the pans again and coat them.

&gt; 
&gt; The current owner thinks the rubber floor mats encourage
&gt; condensation and thus leading to rust under the mat.  I'm
&gt; not so sure.  What says the list?

I went down to metal under the floor mat area, coated heavily with POR-15,
feather-primed at the two hour point,as recommended, then top-coated with
my favorate brand of beige-grey paint to match the rest of the car. When
the mats wear out the paint, I'll re paint. The mats won't wear the POR
out.
