Subject: Roof Racks/Bike racks
Mime-Version: 1.0

My bus has what I beleive is the orginal full roof rack from '65. As I like to take my bicycle with me when traveling I had fashioned a quick bike rack during my last big trip/move across country.  It was pretty rough, as I was actually on the road when I decided to make it. So it was a one day job. 

I was wondering if anyone knows of any type of bike rack that attaches to these original racks. If not I was hoping to design/build one in the spring that would look nicer than the one currently in place. Any info out there regarding this? Anyone interested in this type of rack?  

I think Thule and Yakima make racks, but that would mean taking off the orginal rack, which I don't want to do.
