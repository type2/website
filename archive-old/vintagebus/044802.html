I had a similar problem in both my 70 and 66 buses.  The 70's latch had 
disconnected itself so I just popped it back together, soaked it with WD-40 
and good as new.  The 66 was still intact, just inoperable.  I took the panel 
off the door, remembered the neat bar bending tool pictured in the Bentley 
and just grabbed a hold of the bar and bent it with my hands.  Then I bent it 
again.  I hooked it back up, squirted WD-40 everywhere and good as new.  I 
guess after 34 years of use the bar had straightened out enough or the door 
had stretched out enough for the mechanism to not work quite right.  Whatever 
the reason, it was real nice to have a simple (and cheap) solution to a real 
pain in the butt problem
