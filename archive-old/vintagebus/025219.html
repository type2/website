A quick update on the 65 Samba.  I started color sanding the paint last
week.  I quickly remembered how much i don't like to do this.  So much
time involved, but it will be worth it in the end.  Part's list is
getting small with Glass, rubber and a few piece of interior trim about
all i still need.  Time is the big thing i need right now.  Hope i find
some...

I was cleaning my newly aquired middle seat.  I traded off my old &quot;Fire&quot;
bus for the seat and some other parts.  I was looking at the handles on
top and wondering if there are any replacment to be found out there?
Mine are servicable, but dirty and a bit rough.  Has anyone found a
source for the rubber cover that makes up the handle?  How about any
spare middle screw covers?  Lastly, i have seen some seat's with ash
tray's and some without.  Any info there?  How did it attach?  This is
for a full length middle seat for a 65 Samba.

Thanks
Matthew
