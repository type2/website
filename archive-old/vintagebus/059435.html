Hey y'all,

Well we got back home yesterday after a much needed weekend away from home.  Decided to pass on the SV2's campout close to home and take a road trip to Arizona.

Many thanks to the AZ Bus Club for another good weekend.  It always good to see old friends and meet some new ones.  Hell, the 63EZ won it's first trophy this weekend too! =) 

First trip with the new baby and all went well...or as well as it could in a 40 year old bus, 3 year old, 2 month old and wifey.  Bus ran like a top and all in all we had a nice relaxing weekend.

Saw a little bit of Ronnie's stash...and man o man, there was some bitchin' stuff in there!

Anyways...thanks again to the ABC and everyone involved in the show--and a big thumbs down to the AZ highway department.

See ya at BYOB,

Beto
