Anyone going to this weekend's Tucson, AZ show who has a rear drum for a
small nut tranny pls. bring it. I could very much use it (or a turnable
pair) for the PITA Rat '63.
Thanks in advance.

Persons willing to ship one/two long distance are thanked in advance but I
intend to switch to a later splittie tranny soon. No need to ship at this
point in time. I'll scream once my daily driver seizes. ;-)

Havasu Ronnie email me immediately! 
I see a 3.88 reduction box tranny with a bus 4th and proper bus nose cone in
my future.
