Subject: Re: [VB] Middle seat question

I would call and ask if the new floors come with seat brackets.  I seem to 
remember they didn't years ago, but they may, or may not, now.  The thing is, 
panels didn't come with seat brackets, and depending on whether the seated 
models came with 2/3 or full middle seats the brackets were in different 
places.  Also, with age and rust, seat brackets can go bad, so it is good 
that there is a source for new ones.  If you are replacing floors, tacking in 
a few seat brackets is no big deal.  you can cut the old ones off your bad 
floors, or order new ones if your old ones are toast.  but ya, need to know 
if you need to.

 So, looking at the web, I see something like this:
 
 http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=221801419
 
 Does that mean that the new metal floors, don't come with seat brackets
 welded in?  I am curious who has done this type of fix and can provide info.

 PS Not like I have any back sees for a early model (or can find any) for
 that matter.
