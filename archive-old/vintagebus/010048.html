I'm not clear on your comment involving an external drain tube from a
plastic battery box...

The plastic battery boxes are essentially an oddly-proportioned dish pan,
and the only way they can leak fluid is if they are holed/cracked, or filled
to overflowing.  I've used them, both Grp. 24 and Grp. 27 sizes,  for over
25 years in boats, trucks, and VW buses and have never had any kind of
failure despite some truly severe conditions.

If you wish, you can choose a white box [Rubbermaid] or a black box [Atwood]
to coordinate with the decor of your engine compartment :-)

A plastic battery box may not be &quot;correct&quot; in a VW bus, but it virtually
guarantees that there won't be any acid damage to surfaces or components
adjacent to the battery.

FWIW.....

&gt;  The battery is going into a plastic battery box to lessen future
corrosion.  &lt;

&gt;&gt;  Perhaps with a drain tube that goes down below the deck and points
back, so if there *is* significant spillage, it won't eat the vehicle?
Of course, there is an argument that says that dumping it out on the
road's not a whole lot better....  &lt;&lt;
