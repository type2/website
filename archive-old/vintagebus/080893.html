&gt;While doing some investigating I noticed that I have + 12v coming from
&gt;the negative side of the coil as well as the positive side.  Is this
&gt;the way it should be or has my coil shorted out??

If you are measuring it with a voltmeter, this is normal.  The primary
of the coil has a low resistance (on the order of an ohm or two), so
with no load (points open or CompuFire module not triggered) you will
measure almost the same voltage on either side of the coil.  A test
light might be a bit dimmer on the negative side of the coil, or it
might not be enough for you to notice.  If you rotate the engine so
the points are closed, you should measure something like battery
voltage on the positive coil terminal and almost zero volts on the
negative coil terminal.  I don't know if this check would work with
a CompuFire.
