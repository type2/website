You drive that toasty 67 up to Flag much in the winter? 
Nobody in Phoenix is expected to drive their van to Colorado?
You're forgetting the days when you really would like to defog
the windows?  Why are you acting all high and mighty about not
needing heat in a VW in AZ?  There were plenty of nights last 
year when I was damn glad my house (in Phoenix) had a fireplace.
I'm putting my heater boxes on, and keeping my windshield wipers
on there too.

&gt; F150 with A/C used tonight at 9pm. 

Oh, THAT'S the spirit.  Fordverngugen.
