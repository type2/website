Subject: What's the status of the Bentley campaign?

Hi all,

It's good to have the vintage bus list back
I haven't seen a post on this subject sense the seattle earthquake.
So, for those of you just joining us...
please go to:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/bentley.html
and sign the petition our magnanimous list admin. crafted.
It's purpose is to persuade Robert Bentley publishers to (re) issue a
pre 1963 manual for the type 2.
There were some of us who were concerned about the years covered in the
reissue.
You made your views abundantly clear.
By having done so you most undoubtedly have the ear of the powers that
be.
IMHO everyone should sign it and the bus registry.
This is democracy in action under the auspices of a benevolent
dictatorship
We can him and haw but Thom is the law.

FYI
If you desire join NEATO.

I am withholding my vote in the new elections.
Let's hear from the candidates view on a Bentley mail-in form or
petition in the next issue of  OBR!!
Nah not really, I'm just slowww in getting to vote...
about as slow as some of you are to sign the Bentley petition ;-)

Aloha
Ken Alford
