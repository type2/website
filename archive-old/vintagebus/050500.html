I was told that it's fore the drag racing kiddies, to get the
oil down away from the crank, where it robs HP by hitting the 
crank.  You're thinking of a windage tray.

&gt; I thought the idea behind the deep sump was for dune buggies etc that go at 
&gt; crazy angles.  with a regular oil pick up this can lead to the pump drawing 
&gt; air instead of oil at sharp angles (or shapr cornering), but I don't think 
&gt; that is an issue with the splitty at least 99.9% of the time.
