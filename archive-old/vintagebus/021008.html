 I got caught in a thunderstorm on my way to Wisconsin this past spring in my Pritschenwagen.  It has a 40hp engine and I usually have a cruising speed of about 60mph, with no wind.  I was traveling NW on I-90 with loads of furniture and stuff from IKEA.  The tarped mound of bounty was a couple of feet higher than the single cab so wind resistance was a major factor.  There was strong wind from the SW so intead of trying to tail a truck I would wait for one to pass.  My speed was only 45-8 mph.  You can feel to air from the cab push you out, then suck you in.  I would wait for the suck-in, then steer the p-wagen into the vacuum.  i would steer as close as possible to the truck as possible, perhaps a foot from my mirror and let the vaccuum suck me along.  It  made about a 5-10 mph difference and there were a lot of slow moving trucks bucking the wind so it made a huge difference in my travel time.  Not only was there a vacuum but the trucks protected me from the head and cross winds.
Driving a bus is a lot like sailing a boat.  Wind is the biggest factor and you are always painfully aware of weather conditions.  It can be fun.

when drafting, how do you keep an eye out for the CHP?&gt;&gt;

Back in the early &quot;70's (jeeezzzzeee!!), I took a long trip in a 36hp
beetle. Had to draft trucks the whole way. The distance required depends
on wind speed. But here is the technique: stomp the accelerator all the
way to the floor and climb that truckers behind until you feel the car
start to shake. Continue through this turbulance until you feel yourself
being grabbed and then ease back off the accelerator just before
slamming into the back and enjoy the pull. Now as you get to the crest
of that hill, if you can, stomp the accelerator and shift over to the
speed lane. Try like hell to gain some momentum on the way down that
hill because your truckers speed has likely dropped (if he is heavy
laden). Hopefully you can pass him and whip in behind another truck
because if he has to pass you on the right hand side and you have to get
in behind him again, he is gonna be getting mighty weary of this
technique. Basically, this should be used as an emergency kind of thing:
if you dom't have enough power to drive the highway safely, you should
be taking back roads.
