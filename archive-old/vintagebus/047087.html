Subject: '66 21 coming home soon
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

As the insurance company is now finally settling with me for my 67 kombi, the 
66 21 window non walkthru that I am buying will be coming home soon.

I couldnt make it out to where the bus has been sitting but a listee in the 
area had the opportunity to go check it out for me.  It is still original 
paint, Sea Blue and Cumulous White with almost no body damage.  It has a fist 
size hole in the font floor, a little dent between the passenger font door 
and cargo doors and a small dent on one of the corners.  It does have some 
rust damage to 3 skylight windows but all of this will be repaired as soon as 
it arrives.  It needs a motor and tranny, both of which will come out of the 
67 as soon as im done &quot;refreshing them.&quot; 

It has the front and rear seats but not the middle one.  I have a 67 only 
full length seat for it and if anyone has a 66 one but needs a 67 let me know 
(yes im anal)

It still has all the sunroof stuff in good condition and all the trim and 
jailbars.  Basically everything that it needs I have from my 67 (it was a 
kombi but had lots of deluxe stuff on it) The only other parts I need are 
rear bumper trim.

It sure will be nice back driving a bus in 100 degree plus weather!!
