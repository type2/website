Subject: RE: [VB] Lost a hubcap!

I have German clips and rivets in stock, 1 dollar a clip and 75 cents for
the rivet. I use machine screws and nuts on mine though

Most VWFLAPS have the hubcap clips. Just from previous experience, try like
hell to find GERMAN VW hubcap clips.  The repro ones are pretty crappy IMHO.
On a few occasions I've actually bought clips from a new VW dealer.

I tend to pop my hupcaps off pretty regularly, to check brake adjustment,
wheel bearings, seals,...etc etc.  And every repro clip Ive had has broke.
I replace with a German one..and it lasts.

In regards to the rivets..search the type2_dot_com archives.  There are a few
solutions to your problem.  Unless you want to be completely OG stock, I've
had pop rivets work fine for all my VW's.  I beleive Rex Rogers used small
countersunk nuts and bolts.  Anyways...there are alot of options.

&gt; Wolfsburg West has 'em. You would still need the

&gt; you can make one!
