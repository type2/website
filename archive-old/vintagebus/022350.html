Vintage Freaks go ahead and delete this now....

Well I've only got about an hours worth of sanding left, and then to give
the shop a top to bottom cleaning before I paint the '59 Kombi. I bought
the bus about 1 1/2 years ago. It was the first bus I bought. Unfortunatly
I had a '74 Super Beetle that I had just started working on, and an '88
Monte Carlo SS that was in line after that. I had to do body work and paint
both of those vehicles, as well as doing any neccassary mechanical work in
order to sell them. The plan was to use each to get practice and learn a
little about DIY body/paint work. Great plan. It worked. Unfortunatly I
HATED having to wait to work on the '59 Kombi. I snuck in some time here
and there when the wife wasn't around to &quot;keep tabs on me&quot;. I used the time
to collect parts and learn about buses. I also used the time to plan how I
wanted the bus to finally turn out. During this waiting period, I also
became the owner of a '59 Euro Single Cab, and a very dry '62 23-window.
Both of those need to be brought back to life. It became more aware to me
after getting the '62 that the '59 Kombi just wasn't a good enough
candidate for a full tilt resto. Maybe for someone else, but not for me.

So, I decided to keep things in line with my daily driver custom/resto and
not to get carried away with it. Sometimes I did that, sometimes not
enough, sometimes too much. But anyway... I'm now here down to the
painting, and guess what:

I can't decide what color I want!!!!!

The bus originally was grey. After that it was painted Red, White, &amp; Blue
with stripes and stars...like a flag on wheels! After that, someone brush
painted a 2-tone green/white house paint job onto it. I decided I'd do my
something different from all of these.

I originally was gonna do 2-tone Maroon/White. Not fun enough for me. Then
it changed to 2-tone AquaGreen/White. After seeing MANY green/white busses,
I decided to look for a color you don't really see too much.

I finally decided to settile on a &quot;color with no name&quot;. It's a color in my
head. Starts out kinda peach, not the color peach, but a color that's
actually on the peaches from the trees by my shop. It's got less pink, and
more of a red/brick/orange to it. It'd 2-tone with &quot;the color&quot; and an
off-white. Can you picture it? OK, not everyones taste, but it's my
bus...right?

So I take the wife to the paint store to look at colors. To make a long
story short, I just couldn't find what I thought was &quot;the color&quot;. I start
the flip flopping and end up leaving with a piece of paper with some color
codes on it. Not &quot;the color&quot;, but a blue/teal color!!! What happened? My
wife found the color while I was there, but I guess I got cold feet. I've
worked all this time. Had the picture in my head. I was looking at the
color. Then I chickened out and started looking at other colors...grey,
green, blue, ect....

I was very frustrated with myself on the drive home. But after talking to
my wife, I feel focused again. Tommarrow I'm gonna go back and get &quot;the
color&quot;. It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. 

I guess if it's not something I think I can live with, I'll re-paint the
whole thing grey!!! 

Thanks for letting me vent.
