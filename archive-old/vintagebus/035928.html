Hi John,
We helped Clara rescue her 1953 BD by taking her now Ex and a 1600cc engine 
over the Cascades to put in it.  Do use a stock bus muffler and a 40HP bus 
air cleaner and make sure to rejet your carb for both.  As for the flywheel a 
6 volt 200mm with nine spring pressure plate is great.  These work fine for 
us on our 1960 panel camper with 1641cc and 3.875R&amp;P freeway flier.  Eric&amp;Barb
