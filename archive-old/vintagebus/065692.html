Subject: Re: [VB]  A dumb question

It's a 6-inch speaker.  If you're planning on using the stock in-dash
location and stock bracket, don't plan on using a good speaker either. 
There much room around the wiper mechanism so your speaker must be as
thin as possible.  You'll have to settle for a cheapie Radio Shack
hobbyist speaker versus an audiophile speaker.  You may not find one in
a junked bus with a paper cone still usable.

Then you need a bracket as shown in Thom's Bus FAQ.  If you can't find
one in a junked bus, check the VW swaps or eB*y where one will show up
occassionally.  They are drilled with 4 holes to mate with the speaker,
as well as 2 holes which will mate with the 2 holes in the bottom lip in
your dashboard in the area of the speaker grill.  That's how the bracket
attaches to the dash.

Getting the whole thing installed is a matter of some choice and skill
as the package tray, grab handle hardware, and wiper mechanism will
complicate the installation of speaker and bracket.

&gt; Thanks for all who replied, I don't know why it didn't cross my mind that
&gt; would be where the speaker was. Now off to find an orginal speaker out of an
&gt; old bus in the junkyard. I bet that is gonna be impossible! I haven't went out
&gt; and looked yet up under my dash, I wonder how it hooked up? And what size the
&gt; speaker is. I will figure it out.
&gt; thanks again
