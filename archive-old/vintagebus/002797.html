Bay rear seats are 2'' narrower than a split. Bay rear bottoms come in 2
styles, the difference being the middle leg. One style has the front of all
three legs even. The other style has the middle leg recessed about 3''. If
you have a Standard or a Deluxe with the rear heater log, you need the
bottom with the recessed middle leg. The outer legs match the holddown
points perfectly. The rear back will be a problem to mount
unless you make new angle brackets an inch longer. Bay back seats don't have
the towel bar across the back.....
Bay middle seats come either 3/4 or full width. Either will bolt right up. A
full width requires the holddown keyways at the edge of the cargo door:)
If I remember correctly, a walk thru uses a 3/4 middle seat and a non-walk
thru uses a full seat......


&gt; What are the differences between bay window and split window middle and
rear seats?
&gt; I'm going on Monday to pick up some and was wondering how they are
different.

&gt;What color are the splash pans (on the rear bumper) supposed to be? body
color or bumper color?

On most everyone I've seen, split and bay......they are black.
