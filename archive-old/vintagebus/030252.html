Subject: Re: [VB] carb freezing?

It is usually caused by the heat riser(s) getting plugged up. It is when
your engine starts to idle really bad and there is a thin film of frost
on the outside of the top of your intake and the bottom of your carb. It
doesn't even have to be that cold outside. I had it happen to me in
Stockton California one winter( maybe 40 degrees outside).
