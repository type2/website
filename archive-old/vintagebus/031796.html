Lenny at West Coast Classic has some beautiful belly pans that he had made
in Mexico when he did the BD Deluxe resto (I think that's what he told me
they were from), he does have a few sets for sale. The indentations (out
dentations) are deep and crisp like the originals and if I recall right and
the center pan is one piece.
Schofields from England's indentations are not as deep and crisp and his
center pan comes in 2 pieces. I don't know the price on Lenny's but
Schofields are around $300.00 for a complete set.

Make sure you get the correct bellypans.
There are 51?-58 and 59-67 ones!
Only repops I've seen are the late style.

&lt;&lt;The belly pans are welded on.  The only way to get to the insides would be

to 
remove (cut) them, treat, then re-weld.  Perhaps a better solution in the

would be to check all the little drain holes and make sure they're not 
plugged.

Maybe you could put plugs in all the drain holes, and fill the cavity with a

thinned
POR-15 solution.  Of course it would take a few gallons of this stuff, and 
POR-15 is
~$35/quart...

&gt; I have a bunch of POR15 that I plan to use to keep my bus from ever
rusting 
&gt; away. I've heard that the belly pans are good for water to sit a possibly

&gt; outriggers, etc... I don't want to have to pay Kelly (Metwiz) to fix all 
this
