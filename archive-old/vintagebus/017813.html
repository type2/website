Um, on mine, the metal brake lights go on the *outside* of the belly pan,
kind of in the L of the main frame rail.

While we're at it, for the wiring, there's a tube that runs inside the 
belly pan for the harness.

&gt; I have a '64 double door panel bus (walkthrough). I'm in the process of

&gt; question is this.  I want to replace all of the metal brake lines. But since
&gt; my panel has what seems to be a full undercarriage skid plate (it's factory,
&gt; I'm guessing for bracing of the double doors on the bus, kinda like the
&gt; 'vert rails on a bug or Ghia) what's the best way of doing this? It doesn't
&gt; seem to bolt on, it looks to be spot welded in place.  Has anyone ever done
&gt; this before?? I ALWAYS, replace the complete braking system when I restore a
&gt; VW. Being able to go is nice, but being able to STOP is the most important
&gt; thing to me.
