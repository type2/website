Wow - well I guess stripping is the easy part.  I _wish_ I knew someone

&gt; My best time for pulling a motor and tranny out, and stripping the tranny  
&gt; down to the center section was 3 1/2 hours.   I drove the bus  into the garage 
&gt; with bumper and all on, there were no hitches, and I had no  help.
