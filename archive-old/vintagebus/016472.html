Subject: Bad gas mileage, HELP!
Date: Sun, 28 May 2000 18:54:14 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Here are the facts,

1600 DP engine (I think, no numbers on the case)
Standard tranny not Freeway Flyer
Weber 32/36 progressive carb (recently rebuilt to kit specs)
glass pack exhaust system

Only getting 12.5 mile to the gallon. (Don't know what it was before the 
carb rebuild.)

Oil filler cap smells distinctly of gas.

What could be the problem here? I'm scared that the oil is getting thinned 
out and could cause me to burn up an engine. Please If ya have any 
experience or ideas write me.

Scott
