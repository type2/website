Subject: again, bad gas mileage.
Date: Mon, 29 May 2000 11:51:32 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I've been told that if the jets aren't the right sizes for a 1600 on this 
Weber 32/36 then the mileage will be bad.

Where do I get the right jets and what are the right sizes. I did not put 
this carb on the PO did so I have no info of what was or was not done.

If you've done this please help me. I can't drive this bus like this and I'm 
getting so nervious that I'm up a creek. thanks

Scott
