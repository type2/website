Been doing some work to my bus for the past couple of months and just got
around to posting some pics.  I've hacked off the front flares (gonna do
the rear ones soon), got a red center brake lens, got a set of '57 euro
taillights, got a front ribbed bumper (still need a rear one), oh yeah,
and lowered it.  I don't care what anyone says, I think a lowered bus
handles just as good as a stock-height bus.  Anyway, check out the pics
at:  http://www.uidaho_dot_edu/~brun7176/57bus.html

...stay tuned for paint and a 1776cc!
