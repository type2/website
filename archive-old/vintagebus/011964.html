._dot_can't get ahold of them... I really want the Schofield panels and I 
hope that things will work out (and that Alan's health improves!)... 


If anybody is urgently needing Alan Schofield repro panels I could 
probably get them here in the UK and send them over the pond to you 
guys. This would only help if it's Das Bulli Haus who have got their 
hands too full at the moment - not if it's Alan who is ill. 
I'll give Alan a call today and see if I can get any info on what he 
has in stock at the moment. If anybody has any specific requests, get 
in touch with me. 
I would be happy to trade parts or money for panels (trading parts 
would hopefully stop me getting busted for import duty and VAT on 
parts I was going to get from the US anyway!)
hope this is of some use,
Mack
