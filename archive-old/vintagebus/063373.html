&gt;i recently aquired a dual horn siren setup.

Cool!

&gt;It comes with 2 bosch 6 volt horns(loud as hell) a big black box and a 
&gt;switch. these were from a splitty firetruck.
&gt;
&gt;ANYONE know how the wires go? the black box has like 10 connectors on it.

The diagram is for a later bus, but check out

http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/Transporter_from_August_1967_aditional_items.jpg

for ideas.  It looks like the box was hooked into the regular horn
circuit, as well as having a switch to make its own two horns go.
It also fed the light on top, maybe making it blink.

I would suggest using small fuses (5 amp blade style) in all the wires
from the box to the power source (battery) until you're sure you've
got it hooked up right.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
