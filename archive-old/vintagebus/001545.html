That would be cool. I had a little trouble sorting because some numbers were
either too long, were actually body numbers, or didn't make any sense at
all. Perhaps you could perform some kind of format check when someone enters
a model or body number, so that every number is stored in the correct
format. Or just leave it as it is - if you enter your number wrong, you
don't end up in the sort.

Some day I'll finish writing the search feature, so you can do it all
online...

&gt; I searched the vintagebus registry for '67 year, then copied the model
&gt; numbers to Excel and sorted ascending. According to my calcs, the oldest
bus
&gt; listed is model #247 147 515 (July '67) submitted by Eric Lykens, CA. This
&gt; would be only 994 buses away from the number you listed(217 148 459).
