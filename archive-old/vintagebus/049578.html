Subject: veewee clock repairs

I just received my Deluxe clock back from Barb &amp; Eric, and I gotta say:
first class!!
I paid 5 or 10 bux in a junkyard for this thing, and it didn't run, was
grungy, etc; the dynamic duo charged $35 including shipping and not only
got it to run, they polished, cleaned and waxed the dang thing to showroom
quality... total time was a few months, but time is no object when the
results are so nice. Highly recommended.


Now, if only I had a bus to put it in :)  Actually, what I need is a junky
radio block-off plate that I can cut to fit this clock in the singlecab -
anyone have a rusty or pre-mangled one around? I am NOT getting a nice one
to sacrifice, btw...............
