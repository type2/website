Subject: 64 shift coupler problems

Hi All!

We have a problem on my brother's 64.  It seems the new transmission is
angled such that the hose cone and is tilted slightly upward.  This makes
for a bear of a time connecting the shift coupler.  It also makes shifting a
real bear.  Is it possible to shim between the rear trans carrier and the
mounts to correct this?  Or are we missing something obvious?

Or, as a last resort, does the late bus coupler fit the early busses?  That
design seems a little more forgiving of misalignment..


Thank you all!!
