Hi Greg,
Actually it is what was use for a Riviera.  Thier tents in the 1960s had a 
rope sewn in the edge that slipped into this channel to lock it in there.  
Sundial does not have a rope sewn in thier edges and uses little brackets 
bolted to the roof that in turn are bolted to the tent frame.  So we remember 
this fact by Riviera = rope!   Eric&amp;Barb
