&gt;man that's a freakin' long drive!  for me anyway....
&gt;
Well, for those who didn't see me there or weren't there at all.  I had a
bit of an adventure for my very first Classic Weekend!  Remember how I
wasn't comfortable driving my '63 down there just yet...mom offered me the
use of her 88 Merkur.  Well, something in the tranny went in Ventura Friday
morning.  Through an amazing amount of phone networking and through the
amazing efforts of John and Scott with SV2s, I made it into Oceanside
around 6.30pm that nite.  I still had a blast that weekend and took loads
of pictures (give me a couple days to get them up), but I still had to work
out how to get me and a non-driving car home.  Well, after a lot of calls
back to San Jose, I opted to take the AAA Plus route home and expected to
get home Thursday since I could only do 100mi per day with them.  I spent
the nite in Buellton, near Solvang, then got a truck to Paso Robles today,
managed to trick AAA into getting me to Salinas!  At that point I figured
it was worth a try...and now I'm home!!

My thoughts for the next time I head to the LA area?  Take the train the
whole way!!  I know the SV2s folk will have something for me to drive...and
incredibly huge thanks to all of them who went above and beyond what I'd
expect from any other club!!

Home at last,
-Taylor
