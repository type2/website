&gt;     The dormobile is making a whiring/rattlie sound from the alternator/fan

&gt; RPMs, it worsend considerably when I tightend the belt. 69 motor that looks 
&gt; to have a stock fan housing an alternator that looks fairly new, no obvious 
&gt; external cause. Could this possibly be something in the housing 
&gt; (cracked/flexing fan?) or am I buying a new alternator? any advice/tips are 
&gt; appreciated.

I'll lay 3-5 that you have a cracked or loose fan.
