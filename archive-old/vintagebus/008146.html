Subject: Re: [VB] Reasonable Max Engine RPM ??/Berg Dipstick

&gt; But the question is,
&gt; Some people say that 3500 RPM is a good Max
&gt; I infer from the book that 4000 RPM is Max
&gt; Others have said that 4500 RPM is Max
&gt;
&gt; What is the answer?

My experience yesterday gives me *an* answer...I'm sure that every engine
has its own numbers, but for me in my '60 DC running a stock 1600 DP
doghouse I now feel I know its preferred max.

I recently installed one of those elegant Gene Berg temp dipsticks, and
although I have no idea what is happening until it starts flickering, I
found that day-to-day, the light stays off.  I started pushing it to see
what I had to do to get my engine up to near-overheating.  My top speed
normally is 60mph for any sustained time, and that is at about 3500 rpm as
per my SunPro Minitach.  I ran it yesterday at 60-65 on the freeway (ambient
temp approx. 75 degrees F.) for about 20 minutes with some minor hills, and
after I pushed it up to 70 (3800 rpm) for a bit (3-5 minutes), the oil light
started to flicker, and after going back down to 60 mph, the flickering
stopped.

I shall continue to use 60 as my top sustained speed with 3500 being my top
sustained rpm.  I rev it up to 4000 rpm or so when accellerating, but only
for very short bursts.

In the meantime, I am wondering about that puff of oil smoke that I get
lately after running for a while and then starting back up after a few
minutes.....
