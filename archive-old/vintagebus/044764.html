&lt;&lt; So, my question is...  Can I remove the shift rod if without removing the 
front coupler or am I going to figure out how to drill out those bolts while 
it's still under the bus??? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Only by cutting off the cab floor and nose of the bus....  Best to drill the 
rear square headed bolts then see if you can pull out the forward section of 
shift linkage and the coupler.  BEWARE both the front and rear linkage rods 
are made of very thin steel tubing and so are easy to damage if you clamp on 
them except at the very ends next to the couplers.  There VW installed and 
welded in steel end plugs to go into the couplers.  We had the same problem 
with our 1960 panel with it's one year only front shift rod!  Finally had to 
cut the solid coupler in half widthwise to get the front linkage out of the 
bus and cut off lengthwise the rear half off the rear linkage.  Which with 
the front linkage out of the way we could move the rear linkage forward 
enough to get working space.  Due to drilling too deep we had to weld up and 
redrill the holes in the linkages for the square bolts.  Eric&amp;Barb
