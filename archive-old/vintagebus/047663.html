Midnight Repairs

He came down the back drive just before midnight on Christmas Eve.  I was out
in the 
shop, about to call it a night when I heard the unmistakable sound of a
Volkswagen 
running on three cylinders.  Bad valve. 

It was an early model high-roof delivery van.  Bright red with white trim.  He
pulled up 
behind the shop.  As he shut down the engine it made that unmistakable tinny
rattle of a 
dropped valve seat.  Good thing he shut it off when he did. 

There was a barber pole logo painted on the door:  “NicEx”  A young old-guy
jumped out, came toward me offering his hand.  He was wearing a snowmobile
suit, red &amp; white like the van.  I could smell the engine.  It was running
‘way too hot.  

“Fred Dremmer,” he said.  We shook.  He was about my age, mebbe a little more,
but 
young, if you know what I mean – alive.  Phony beard though.  It was his own
but too 
shiny and perfectly white to be natural.  I eyed the get-up he was wearing,
took another 
gander at the door.  “Nice ex?”

“NICK ex,” he corrected me.  “I’ve got the franchise for this area.”  He
looked around, 
noted the tumbledown appearance of the shop, victim of an earthquake that
never 
happened, thanks to politics.  “Are you still building engines?” he asked.

“Not so’s you’d notice.”   It was pushing on toward midnight and colder than a
well-
diggers knee.  His shoulders slumped down.

“But you used to build engines,” he said hopefully.  I didn’t deny it.  “They
said you 
offered a lifetime warranty.”  

Actually, I didn’t offer ANY warranty.  Most of the engines I built were high-
output big-
bore strokers.  A firecracker doesn’t carry any warranty either.  And for the
same reason.  But if I built it, I promised to fix it if they could get it
back to the shop.  And if the problem was my fault, there was never any
charge.   So I told him, “Something like that.”  

“My van has one of your engines,” he said.  “In fact, I think all the
franchisees use them.”

“This I gotta see,” I laughed.  He ran around to get the church-key but I’d
popped the 
engine hatch with my pocketknife by the time he got back.  I twisted on my
mini-maglite 
and sure enough, there was ‘HVX’ stamped right where I’d stamped it.  It was
one of the 
lower numbers, a bone stock 1600 I’d built back in the seventies.  Big sigh.

“Can’t you fix it?”

I gave him a look and he shut up.  It had just gone midnight, clear and cold
and silent.  
The on-shore flow had increased, bringing with it the charred smell of
disaster.  About a 
mile to the west of me a family’s house had caught fire and burned to the
ground only 
hours before.  Merry Christmas indeed.   I straightened up, knees creaking,
and went to 
fetch the floor jack.  As I moved away from the vehicle the guy got all
excited, plucked at 
my arm.  “Really, it’s very important… “  I snarled something appropriate and
he let me 
go, stood like a dejected lump in his idiotic outfit.  He brightened up when I
came back 
towing the floor jack, a pair of jackstands in my other hand.

“You’re going to fix it?”  If he was a puppy he would have been licking my
face.

“Nope.  You got a bad valve.”  I got the jack under the tranny support and
started 
pumping.   “Which ain’t my fault, by the way.  I built this engine nearly
thirty years ago.  
You’ve gotten your money’s worth and then some.”  I got the jackstands under
the torsion 
bar housing, went around and chocked the front wheels.

“I wasn’t complaining… “  he began.  

“Well I was,” I shut him off.  Veedub valves don’t last thirty years,
especially when they’re 
pushing a van around.

“It always ran perfectly.”  His tone was placating.  And it was Christmas Eve.
Or rather, 
0015 Christmas Day.  “And it never gets driven very much, or so I was told.”
I gave a 
snort of disgust.  Thirty years is thirty years and every salesman always sez
the thing was 
only used to take the family to church on Sundays.  I got a tarp and my small
tool bag, 
rolled the tarp out under the back of the high-roof, dug out my head lamp,
checked the 
batteries.  Dead, of course.  Began taking the battery case apart.  

“Need some batteries?”  He was right there, offering me a 4-pak of new Ray-O-
Vac’s.  
Right size, too.  I put the thing back together, tested it.  “What are you
doing, exactly.”

“Swapping engines,” I grunted.  I handed him a ratchet with a 13mm socket and
pointed 
at the rear apron bolts.  “Whip’em outta there.  And don’t lose the washers.” 

I skivvied under and got the surprise of my life.  The thing was CLEAN.  As in
showroom 
new.  No road rash.  No oily residue.  Original factory axle boots so clean
and new they 
gave a tiny squeak when I touched them.  But no heater ducts.  In fact, no
heat 
exchangers, which explained why the guy was wearing a snowsuit. 

“Does this mean I can finish my route?”  He was bent over, peering at me
upside down. 

“Not unless you get those damn bolts out, it don’t.”   I was running my hand
over the 
paintwork.  It had been treated with some sort of surfactant.  It felt oily
smooth but left no 
residue on my fingers and didn’t seem to attract dirt.  There were steel rails
re-enforcing 
the frame on each side.  They ran as far aft as the bumper mount.  I couldn’t
tell how far 
forward they went.  “You do all this?” I shouted as I crimped-off the fuel
line.  The breast 
tin had one of my early bulkhead fittings, the ones I made out of brass before
discovering 
lamp parts worked just as well.  I popped off the hose.  No dribble but I
plugged it 
anyway.

“I don’t maintain the vehicle,” the fellow shouted back.  “They do all that at
headquarters. 
What should I do with the bolts?”

“Put them in your pocket.”  I skivvied back out, popped loose the battery
ground strap, 
removed the rear apron, disconnected the electrics and removed the barrel nut
holding 
the accelerator wire.  I gave it to him.  “Keep this with them.”  I put the
little plywood pallet 
on the floor jack, got it positioned under the engine, jacked it up and pulled
that puppy 
outta there.

Fred Dremmer was impressed.  He even told me so.  “I’m impressed,” he said.
Then he 
said “Happy Christmas.”  It was 0030 and I was tired.  “Balance that,” I told
him, tapping 
the top of the blower housing.  I grabbed the handle of the jack and used it
as a trolley to 
pull the engine into the shop.

He stood looking around while I dug the spare engine out from under the bench.
It was 
already on a scooter.  “What happened?” he asked softly.  

“Look down,” I snarled.  “You’ll figure it out.”  

He looked down, toed the gaping crack that ran across the floor like a
lightning bolt, saw 
the way the shop was sloping.  “Earthquake?”  

“Northridge.  Popped the foundation like a pane of glass.”  I pulled the
engine out into the 
open, keeping it on the level part of the floor.  

“Don’t they offer special loans… “

“Only if you’re in the ‘official’ earthquake zone,” I laughed.  He started
making apologetic 
sounds.  “Balance that,” I told him.  We scootered the spare engine out of the
shop.

I had to swap mufflers.  His came away okay, thanks to the lavish amounts of
anti-seize 
someone had swabbed on the fittings.  It was one of those lifetime stainless
steel bus 
mufflers from Germany or England or some damn place.  Cost the earth.  He
looked 
around, sat down on the workbench when I nodded toward it.  We were out back
of the 
shop, under the shed roof.  Plenty of light.

“So what are you getting for Christmas,” he asked, smiling.  

I just looked at him, shook my head.  I work best without an audience.  “You
want some 
coffee or something?  This is going to take me a few minutes.” 

 He said No; he had a thermos of tea in the van.  “Seriously, what do you want
for 
Christmas?” he smiled.

“Not being pestered in the middle of the night would be nice,” I muttered.

He just laughed, as if I was joking.  “Seriously,” he said again.

“You want ‘seriously’?   Howabout a new house for those folks down the hill?” 

He gave me a blank look and I realized he didn’t know about the fire.  So I
told him.  He 
ended up looking as sad as I felt.  “What do you think they’d like for
Christmas?”  I 
goaded him.  I shook my head, “It’s mostly bullshit anyway.  A birthday party
that’s gotten 
outta hand.”  And the best evidence of that was right there in front of me,
some yuppie 
asshole Yuletide delivery service running around on Christmas Eve in an
antique bus.  
He stood gazing off toward where the fire was.  It had been a huge blaze, you
could see 
it good from the house.  Hopes and dreams and Christmas trees are all highly 
combustible. 

I finished transferring the J-tubes and muffler to the spare engine and he
helped me shift 
it on to the jack.  We pulled it out to his bus and I started putting it in.

“It’s unusual to find someone who doesn’t want anything for Christmas,” he
said.  I’d 
given him a pair of vise grips to hold.  I didn’t need them but I figured it
would make him 
feel useful, mebbe shut him up.  Wrong.

“I’ve got everything I want.”  I’d checked the splines.  Things were lining up
good.  His 
seals looked new.  I gave them a spray of glycerin so they wouldn’t grab the
engine.

“That’s even more unusual,” he said.  He was smiling, acting a little antsy
but working 
hard to keep me happy so he could get the hell out of there.  About the worst
thing that 
could happen to him would be for me to slow down.  So I did.

“People spend too much time wishing for things they don’t need.”  I patted the
red high-
roof.  “I’ll bet this thing is chock full of yuppie junk, eh?”    He looked
uncomfortable, 
passed the pair of vise grips from hand to hand.  “And what about you?  I’ll
bet you’re 
some sort of retired executive, working a little Christmas-time tax dodge to
supplement 
your retirement, eh?  Bleached beard with a platinum rinse, funny suit and
this oh-so-cute 
Santa’s Helper delivery van, popping up in the middle of the night to trade on
an implied 
warranty almost thirty years old?”

“What are you saying?”  He looked kinda angry.  The sight was as silly as his
costume.  

“You wouldn’t understand,” I sighed.  I fished the throttle wire thru the
blower housing, 
plugged the engine back in, started the upper nuts and shanghaied him into
holding the 
wrench while I skivvied back under.  Did the nuts, torqued to spec, did  the
fuel line, 
checked things over, skivvied back out.  With everything installed underneath,
I began 
putting the engine compartment to rights.

“You mean the religious aspect,” he said.

“You heard about that, eh?”  I kept working.  

“Are you a religious man?” he asked softly.

I was connecting the generator leads.  I wanted to ignore him but couldn’t.  I
stopped, 
rocked back so I could see his face.  “Yeah,” I told him.  “I’m religious as
hell.  And so are 
you.  But the difference is you worship money and I don’t.”

“And you can tell all that just by working on my van?”  He was smiling.  He
was no longer 
angry but really cheerful.

“Yeah, I can.  You’ve had some sort of anti-stick powder-coating process
applied to the 
whole undercarriage.  That must of set you back some major bucks.  But it’s
not a car-
show kinda van otherwise it would be all original underneath.  That tells me
you did it so 
you could impress your customers with your shiny, never dirty ride and THAT
tells me 
you probably charge some big bucks for your Christmas Eve delivery service
gig.”

That wiped the grin off his face.  “Very astute,” he muttered.  Then frowned.
“But if you 
knew it was all just another Christmas-biz scheme, why are we standing out
here in the 
middle of the night while you repair the engine?”

I laughed at him.  “See?  I said you wouldn’t understand.”  

I finished the hook-ups, connected the battery, replaced the rear apron,
connected the 
throttle wire, wiped everything down.  “Go run the starter for a minute.  We
gotta prime 
the carb.”  He clumped around to the front and got in.  I hadn’t noticed the
boots until 
then.  Or the buckles.  Ridiculous.  

I held the throttle open while he ran the starter.  He held it down for about
thirty seconds 
then came clumping back.  “Won’t it start?”

“It’ll start.”

“Shall I do it some more?”

“Not right now.”  I sat there, loaded a pipe, got it going.  He turned out to
be a pipe man 
too.  Some foreign smelling crap.  I’ve got Prince Albert in the can.  I
mentioned that fact 
but he didn’t get the joke.  Or mebbe he did.  It was about a quarter after
one.  

“What are we waiting for?”

“For the starter to cool.  It’ll start now.”  And it did.  Nice steady idle.

I took his credit card and driver’s license, did the paper work.  He balanced
the clipboard 
on the steering wheel, signed both slips without question.  “This is just a
deposit,” I 
explained.  “Bring back my engine, you can tear it up.”  But right then I had
a premonition 
I wouldn’t see him or my engine again.

“What was it I didn’t understand?” he asked softly.  It sounded like he really
wanted to 
know.

“Christmas presents?”  I motioned toward the back of the van.  There was a
partition 
behind the driver’s seat that blocked my view. He nodded. “That’s what you
don’t 
understand.”  He looked blank.  “I get mine all year ‘round,” I laughed.

“Like what?”

“Like my family.”  He gave me that frown again and I laughed.  “See?  You
haven’t got a 
clue.  A smile from my wife is a better thing to have than any of the crap
you’ve got back 
there.” 

The dawn of understanding began to break across his brows.  “That’s… that’s
pretty old 
fashioned.”

“Old as the hills,” I agreed.  “Older than Christmas, too.”  

Now he got it.  “I’m sorry,” he stammered.  “I assumed you were a Christian… “

“I am,” I laughed.  “Of a sort.  And a Muslim, if it comes right down to it.
And a Buddhist 
and a Jew and Inuit too.”  And maybe a touch of White Buffalo.

Now he was laughing and nodding.  “Okay, I get it.  I think.”  But I didn’t
think he did.  He 
cocked his head, gave me a thoughtful look.  “Yours must be an interesting
wish-list.”

I smiled back at him.  Maybe he really did get it. “Sunsets are nice.  A good
sunset is a 
thing to be thankful for.”

“Good health…” he offered.  I nodded.  He was clearly getting it. “Good
friends…”

“That’s the idea.  All that…”  I gestured toward the back of the van, “…is
just… stuff.”

“It’s the thought that counts…”

“Yeah, but only if the thought is there all year ‘round.  Christmas dinner for
the homeless 
followed by 364 hungry days?  Gimme a break.”

He nodded again, slower this time.  “What about the engine?”

“Because I said I would.”

That one took him a minute.  Then he got it.  “Trust…”

“And honor… yeah, stuff like that.  Telling someone you’ll do something then
actually 
doing it…  That’s a present of sorts in today’s world.” 

“But… thirty years later…”

“Doesn’t matter.  What got me pissed was you showing up in the middle of the
night.  And 
that silly suit!  Do you know you look like Santa Claus?”  This time we both
laughed.

“But haven’t you ever wished for something at Christmas?” he asked softly.

“You mean, like world peace or wishing no one’s house would ever burn down on 
Christmas Eve…”

He interrupted me with a gesture.  “No, I meant something personal.  A tool,
perhaps?”

“I’ve got all the tools I need.”

He kept looking at me.  “Never wished for anything?  Not even once?”

“Sure,”  I laughed.  “When I was a kid.”

“What was it?”

Time sucked me back more than half a century.  “A wagon,” I admitted.  “A
‘Radio Flyer’ 
wagon.  It was about the same color as your van.  Roller bearing wheels.  It
was the most 
beautiful thing I’d ever seen.” I was five years old.  I can still smell the
oiled wooden floor 
of the Montgomery Ward store in the little California town as I knelt to
worship the 
marvelous machine.  They had it propped up so you could spin the wheels,
listen to the  oily purr of the roller bearings.  I was sure it could go at
least a hundred 
miles an hour and carry me any place I wanted to go, a magic carpet disguised
in steel.

“Did you get it?”   The soft question drew me back. Overhead the stars snapped
back into 
focus on the velvet cape of night. 

“Take care of my engine,” I ordered as I shut his door, stepped away from the
vehicle.  

He slid back the glass.  “Did you?”

“You’re going to be late.  Wouldn’t want to upset all those yuppies.”  He
considered that, 
conceded the point with a nod.  He fired it up and backed cautiously up the
drive then 
went rolling down the hill toward the road.


I slept late.  When I stepped out of the shower there was a steaming cup of
coffee in my 
favorite mug.  Someone had laid out my shaving tackle.  

The kitchen was full of smiles and good smells of things to eat as the women
prepared 
our Christmas dinner.  My wife gave me a big kiss and a bigger smile.  “I
almost tripped 
over it when the kids arrived,” she laughed.  I had no idea what she meant,
gave her a 
blank stare.  She gave me a playful punch.  “Fool. It’s perfect.  I can use it
for moving 
flower pots and carrying potting mix… “  Something exploded in the microwave
and she 
joined the fire brigade.  I took my coffee out to the patio.

It was parked on the walk under the hibiscus, just inside the redwood gate.  A
coaster wagon agleam in red.  It looked brand new.  It even smelled new.
'Radio Flyer' in white script along the side of the bed.  The handle was
black.  The wheels white with thick black rubber tires.

My wife came out, slipped her arm around my waist, leaned her head on my
shoulder.  
“It’s beautiful.  Where did you ever find it?”

In the kitchen, my daughter overhead her.  “He probably MADE it!”  Everyone
laughed.  
Even me.

“Is this what you’ve been working on?  You came to bed awfully late.”

I shook my head, sipped my coffee.  My great-grandmother was Kiowa.  Coffee
was 'burnt-bean-soup'.  And still is, to me.   “No.  I think it’s a gift.”

My wife gave me an odd look.  “Who would give us something like that?”

“I don’t know.  Maybe a white buffalo.”

She laughed, hugged me a little harder.  “You’re crazy.”

“Yep,” I agreed.
