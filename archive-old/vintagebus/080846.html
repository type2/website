&gt; You have to be concerned with both air and liquid properties.  With less

Interesting!

&gt; There is an older pamphlet that was published by Solex, 8x11 inch in
&gt; size, black cover with white graphics... covers 28pci, 32 pbic, etc.
&gt; etc. that has a few nice pages on altitude correction.

Anybody have this?
