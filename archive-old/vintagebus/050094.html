Subject: Re: stainless steel mufflers

&gt;&gt;     But I wonder if these new mufflers will be of any benefit. Stainless
&gt;&gt;    does rust. . .just at a slower rate. And mufflers generally rust from
&gt;&gt;     the inside out. With the heat that a VW makes, I am not so sure that
&gt;&gt;      stainless will be of any benefit.

The stainless muffler in my wife's Japanese sedan has 220,000 on it over 12
years with no detectable corrosion. Stack that up against a Kadron. 8) I'm
sure anybody with a stainless muffler will tell you that it lasted as long
as the car.

FWIW the folks in England I contacted about stainless mufflers last year
said they had lost their source and hoped to have a new source and more in
stock &quot;come Autumn.&quot; That would be last fall but I never inquired again and
I've lost the email address in a disk tragedy. Bob Wallace knows who it is
I think...withal, I'm happy to see Mr. Van Ness handling this instead of
me.  8) 8) 8)
