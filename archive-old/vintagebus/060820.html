Subject: OCTO listee meeting - Post OCTO meet

How about 10:00 at Ronnie's and if there's a 10:00 
raffle, and hour later at 11:00? 

For the third or fourth year all listees are invited to 
hoist one on me at the brew-pub across the street from 
the meet. We'll start right after the end of the OCTO 
meet, look for my bright orange/yellow doublecab. Or if 
I don't finish the transaxle transplant this week, any 
splitty in the parking lot on Katella directly south of 
the OCTO entrance. 
You'll miss most of the toy show, but we have a good 
time. Here's the details...

Restaurant &amp; Brewery 
2610 E. Katella Ave Anaheim, CA 92806

&gt; Maybe 10:00 AM would be better? I know there are raffle's throughout the 
&gt; day, but don't know the times. But 10:00AM might be a better time...

&gt; &gt; Might noon be a little late, considering the other events that are 
&gt; &gt; starting
&gt; &gt; that afternoon, such as the Toy/Literature show, etc?  Just a 
&gt; &gt; thought . . .

&gt; &gt;&gt; Since Ronnie seems to make all the OCTO shows, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone knows
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ronnie, why don't we set a time and place, such as
&gt; &gt;&gt; noon at Ronnie's site
&gt; &gt;&gt; for pictures and a get together, unless someone has
&gt; &gt;&gt; a better suggestion.
