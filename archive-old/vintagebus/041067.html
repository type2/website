Thom
No it is not Dawn. I can't seem to get her to respond to any of my emails
and with her slightly checkered past it has made me a bit apprehensive.
Sending $700.00 and waiting up to 6 months is not for me. Though I must
admit she does EXCELLENT WORK and would use her if she was still doing
business (her web page states she is not taking orders).
Jill's email is as follows if anyone is interested jillgoble_at_hotmail_dot_com

Are you sure her name's not really &quot;Dawn&quot;?
