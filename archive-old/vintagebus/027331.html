Subject: 64 bus for sale

I don't want to sell my new baby....but I need to.  I can't say
why...but it is for a good cause I assure you.  Billy will know what I'm
talking about ;)


64 Sundial. The interior has had some work done to it...but nothing
major. It looks pretty good. The rear fold out seat could use
recovering, but I'd sleep on it. The front seats are bay window seats
and it needs correct seats. I have beetle seats that fit in it also that

would go with it. They bolt down as the PO had them in there. They're
comfy! This bus IS a walk through which is very nice. The nose is ugly
and full of dent puller holes and would require work. The rear corners
and rockers are nice and the cargo floor is solid. The frame is very
nice also. The wheel wells have been cut, but they don't look too bad.
The tent brackets on the roof are still there. There is no major rust on

this bus, just slight surface rust in areas. The speedometer is a KM
speedo and is pretty cool :) The motor is a new mexican case motor with
an alternator (the bus is 12V) and it runs really nicely. The trans is
good and doesn't pop out of any gears and it shifts nice. The wiring on
this bus could use some work despite the fact it all works. This is a
running and driving bus. This would make a great driver bus that would
sit next to your trailer queen :) This bus needs to sell, so please drop

me a note. No jokers please, I don't have a lot of time to waste, but if

you are seriousely interested I will give you my undivided attention. I
need to sell this bus as another bus has presented itself. Thanks for
looking!

I'd like to start at $1600 but that is negotiable.

Thanks a bunch!
