Hi Craig,
    The wheels fit on a bus no problem.
The rear center caps however do not. I plan to
use some stock aluminum pipe and make extensions for the caps so they clear
the stub axles.
My friend has a laith and he will let me use . I will let you know how it
works out.
Most of the people I've asked about there brm's on their buses have irs rear
ends so they didn't encounter this snag.

    Good Luck,



                                woody

&gt; I am wickedly jealous. I cannot wait until my 60 Double Cab looks that
nice. I even plan a
&gt; similar look - sand green top, palm green bottom with BRM's. That ride is
just beautiful! I
&gt; still have the question about what had to be done to fit the BRM's.
&gt; good job,
