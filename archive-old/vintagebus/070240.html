Subject: Re: brake systems on trailer WARNING NO BUS CONTENT

It is an inertial braking system, which means that the hitch is free to
slide
within the tongue of the trailer (very limited) and when the towing
vehicle
applies brakes and decelerates it causes the hitch to be pushed into the

tongue which applies pressure to a master cylinder and applies brakes to
the
trailer.  Once the trailer has slowed and the force is removed then the
brakes
are released.  It is a constant fight between forces maintaining
equilibruim.
The end result is that the only pressure the trailer puts on the towing
vehicle while stopping is equivalent to pushing in a (rather tight)
brake
pedal.

&gt;
&gt; just out of curiosity how does these brake systems work?
