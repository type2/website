&gt; Is there supposed to be a clip of some kind that holds the fuse box up 
&gt; against the plate it mounts in?  

Hi Charles,
Yes, there is!  Part number 111 937 591 Retaining clip.

&gt; And any suggestions on how to remove paint off wires?  

Try 3Ms Safest Stripper at your local hardware store.  It will not fume you 
to death of eat your wiring.  the main thing you have to figure by testing is 
how long it need to soak to remove the overspray paint.
