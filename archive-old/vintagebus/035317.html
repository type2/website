Hi Taylor,
Take off the window rain gutter, and then the window taking carefull note of 
how the old sealant was installed.  Clean, polish, and oil/grease the window 
parts up.  Throughly clean the window openings on your bus and polish/wax.  
If the window has a crank type opening system carefully take it apart and 
clean out the oil grease and any dirt out of the mechanism and regrease 
(graphite grease is best.).  Put it all back together and reinstall, but be 
carefull not to overtorque the mounting screws of the window and it's rain 
gutter to the point that it distorts the metal around the screw heads.
