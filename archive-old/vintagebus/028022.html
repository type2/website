Subject: Broken camshaft

Hello Friends!

Today, I finally tore down the engine that stranded me at Everybus. I
had thought that either the rivets that hold the cam to the gear had
broken, or the cam had broken. Well, it turns out that apparently, two
of the four rivets had indeed broken, one of them got caught between the
gears, and the cam broke right where it meets the flange. As far as I
can tell, the only damage to the case is a little bit of wear where the
loose cam gear rubbed against the case, and a small chip at the bottom
part of the case where the distributor drive gear rides.

This is on the Fisher Buggies 1776 I bought for $200 a few months ago (I
bought the engine used, about 2 years old, with all the receipts).

Since the engine is completely torn down, I'm replacing all of the
bearings. I'm replacing the broken stock cam with an Engle 110 and
installing lightweight lifters. The parts guy suggested that I run
different springs on my valves as well.  I'm tempted to feed the beast
with some new dual 40mm Kadrons as well, and do a proper paint and
dress-up with all the bolt-on stuff...

Might as well, since it's torn apart, and I work at a VW shop and can
get all the stuff at employee discount...

This is my first complete rebuild, and I'd like any suggestions for
stuff that I might include or stay away from. I know that chrome tin is
a no-no, but what parts are ok in chrome?

david
