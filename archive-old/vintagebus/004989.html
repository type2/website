Using advice from a listee on the Type 3 list (good people), I ordered
a kit from POR-15 today http://www.por-15_dot_com to seal the gas tank in
the my '54 Single.  He tried both a kit from Eastwood and this kit
from POR-15 on 2 different vehicles and found the POR-15 to be
superior.  The California distributor is &quot;The Finished Look&quot; at
1-800-827-6715.  It was about $50 with shipping for the pint kit,
which goes up to a 12-gallon tank.

Good luck,
Everett Barnes
