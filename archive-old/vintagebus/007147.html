Your spring plates may be out of adjustment, the rear torsion bars will sag
over time (like 32 years!).  Refer to your shop manual for the correct
setting.  Of course, you have to pull off the spring plate cover plate and
drop down the spring plate to measure the current setting...

Interesting fact, the degree settings for the spring plates on my '54 Single
are only 8 degrees, you can install the spring plates and covers without a
jack!

&gt;I have a '67 deluxe microbus and after replacing the rear shocks,
&gt;the rear end still seems to sag, but not as much as before the shocks were
&gt;replaced. Is it that the front is sitting too high maybe?
&gt;Anyone have the same sort of problem?
