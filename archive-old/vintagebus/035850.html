Subject: 912 E Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To all non-vintage nazis, 
I have been thinking of an engine swap for my 67 Westy to make freeway 
driving less challenging. I have a 1600 DP that is running fine but I need to 
rev to 4200-4500 to keep up with traffic. I know this is not great for 
longevity, even with a dog house, and synthetic oil. Temps stay under 225. A 
trans swap to IRS and longer gears is planned &quot;sometime.&quot;

I have looked at the hot rod Type 1 rebuilds, over bore to 1835+, or perhaps 
a stroker crank shaft or what ever. $2,500+ for a motor that is still revving 
way more that it was designed for. A Type 4 swap with the Joe Cali changes 
has the power and rev-ablity, but also $2,800++. Advantage is that it has 
been done and Joe wrote a good book to tell you how.

I note that 2.4 L 911 motors with 5 speed trannys are now becoming available 
at about $2,000+/- in good used condition. Good revs (6,500+), good HP, okay 
torque, but a lot of work to swap into a split window. The package is too 
long to fit. Either the engine cover grows a &quot;power bulge&quot; or the trans and 
torsion bars moves forward, or both.

Has anyone heard of or seen a Porsche 912E motor dropped into a split window?
I have the opportunity to buy a 912E motor complete with all FI parts, engine 
tin, and rear engine support bar, heater boxes, etc.,  for $1,500 in good 
used rebuilt shape.
It is basically a 2L Type 4 motor with a Porsche factory conversion to an 
upright fan, fuel injection with a mass air flow sensor (good stuff) and 
about 95 HP at about 6,000 rpm, great torque at about 4,000 rpm. 

It should be less than half the work of installing the 911 motor (no dry sump 
oil tank, about the same length as the Type 1 motor, etc.) with more power, 
torque and rpm capability to handle modern freeways.
My question. Has anybody done this before?? I am looking for info on the how 
to address the problems of making this swap work. I know it is not &quot;correct&quot; 
or &quot;factory,&quot; but it is my bus dammit. It is almost a daily driver and I like 
to tinker. No flames please.
