Subject: Re: [VB] 6V vs 12V

&lt;&lt;and that's what I've got. It's a 73 engine. I'm kind of toying with
the idea
of buying this bug that I've seen sitting in the mechanics lot which has
an
FI engine in it. Mechanic does not know how to work AC engines, admitted
to
me myself and poor owner want's to sell non running SB. $500.00 seems
too
high. I want to offer $200, see if it sticks and then somehow work the
engine into my bus. Can someone give me some feedback on this?&gt;&gt;

Andre,

1973 was the last year bug engine that was carborated (except maybe
California. . . don't know about that). So, that would be an excellent
choice for your bus.

Les
