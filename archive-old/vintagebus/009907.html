It's very common to find brakes &quot;adjusted&quot; like the ones you found when you
pulled the drum.

For some reason &quot;brake specialists&quot; in commercial shops think they know what
they're doing and don't bother to check out the specs for adjusting brakes
on a particular vehicle.  They seem to assume that they all adjust the same.
I don't know if this is due to arrogance or ignorance - probably both.

An all too common result is a blown wheel cylinder and catastrophic brake
failure.  You got lucky this time around.

&gt;Wholly Crap!  I'm glad I got that axle nut off... One of the star screws
was
&gt;out ALL THE WAY, I mean ready to fall out.   The other was all the way
in...
&gt;The drum is destroyed from the one shoe being worn down to metal and the
&gt;other one looks brand new :)  At least I can get away with replacing only
&gt;one shoe :)
&gt;
&gt;My Bus Depot order arrived at 10:30am from UPS... so I'm getting those
&gt;brakes in order.  Tom can vouch that the PO of this bus had some serious
&gt;problems with brake maintenance.. the front right was a mess too, and the
&gt;other rear cylinder was leaking :)
&gt;
&gt;No wonder it pulled to the right... the front left cylinders were leaking
&gt;and soaking the shoe, the rear left were totally screwed-up.  So only my
&gt;right side brakes were working.  Glad I replaced that right rear cylinder
at
&gt;Thom's before driving home (800 miles) :)
&gt;
&gt;The left front was waiting on the parts that arrived today.  Whoo hoo!

&gt;He did.  With 3/4&quot; impact tools he got it off on about the 25th impact.
&gt;Took a good 5 seconds of pounding before it went.
