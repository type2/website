Go to the website.  There are more photos of it &quot;before&quot; they cut it up.  It had swinging doors on BOTH sides.  No signs of seats or a tilt bed.  The complete rear 1/3 of the bead and corners were toast/non exist ant.

Did anybody notice on this bus that the side door swings open, not down like
on my old side loader. This could have been one of those repair trucks with
a seat in the back and a small tilt for the workers, somewhere on Vintagebus
or the Planet is a photo of this style of truck.

&gt; Not only was it a side loader, it had doors on both sides.  It got hacked
up
&gt; too!  Where is Kelly when you need him?

Double Damn!!!  I didn't see that.  If any bus was a candidate for
restoration, that one should have been.  Even Ronnie's mint condition side
loader is only on one side.  It's a shame that one was let go for so long -
that would have had to have been a special order then didn't it?

&gt; Did you see the long load trailer that is on Dropgates_dot_com??  Its under
&gt; accessories.  There is a link to a German site. I would just about trade
my
&gt; Westy (project) for one ;-)  Of course #10 is &quot;thou shall not covet&quot; so I
&gt; guess I'll have to make my own ;-O  That thing is SOOOOO cool I can't
stand
&gt; it.

You bet I did - that bus with the swivel in the bed and the trailer behind
it?  I would love to load up some Parallam beams at work and haul them to
the jobsite on that setup.  It'd be fun just to haul a telephone pole around
on it and to shows.  You'd be a hit then!
