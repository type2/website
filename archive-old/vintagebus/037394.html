Subject: Bus tow bar
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 Hi list, Yesterday I had to rent a tow dolly to get my Bus over to the body 
and paint shop. The guy at U-haul charged me 40 bucks. I will have to rent it 
again to bring her home when there done painting her. I was thinking of just 
buying a tow bar of my own to avoid further rental cost. How much do they go 
for and were can I get one? Any help will sure be appreciated. Aloha Mike
