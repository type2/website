&lt;&lt;  Can someone tell me what the &quot;name&quot; of that color is and if there is a
 paint mixing number for it?  It is a grey color but has a sort of greenish
 tint to it.  I have seen several double cabs in that color and have heard of
 several greys that apply to buses, but don't know which one I have. &gt;&gt;

I have heard it called mouse grey, and read along time ago in a Jeff Walters
article that they call it Dove Grey in the UK.
