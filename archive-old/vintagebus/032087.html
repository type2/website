Hi JTB,
Not knowning what year engine or bus you have we can not say for sure what 
the spark plug thread size should be.  All you really need to do is take one 
of your spark plugs down to a threaded supply shop like &quot;Tacoma Screw&quot; and 
make sure to get a tap for your size in a HSS (High Speed Steel) tap.  
Whichever size it is do not use a Heli-Coil, unless it is in an area you 
practicly never take apart.  In the case of spark plugs the Heli-Coil all too 
often comes out with the spark plug and does not always thread back in!  Try 
Time-Sert on the web for solid inserts that will give you no troubles!
