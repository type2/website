&gt; With the engine is out we found the problem is the t/o bearing shaft - the

Hi P&amp;C,
Check out the groove the C-clip is supposed to ride in.  We had the same 
problem and it turned out the bottom of this groove was beveled so the clip popped 
out.  More than likely the TO arms are wasted with the side to side action of 
the TO bearing once it was off center.  Worse comes to worse you can drive 
your bus without a clutch till the next FLAPS with the parts you need.
