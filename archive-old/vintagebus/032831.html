&lt;&lt; I want to put in a oil temp gauge.  I took a look at what I could on the
 archives ( when the search is running :p ) and it seems the recommended
 solution is to use the dip stick sender?  Opinions were not conclusive.  I
 had a oil relief valve sender a long time ago in another VW, any pros/cons
 on either one?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
The relief valve and sump plate are on the bottom of the oil, which is going
to be cooler.  Also the air current and water splash from the tires under the
engine will cool this reading also.  The dip stick will read the upper layers
of oil, but the readings one really wants is the oil going to the bearings.
The best place for a temp sender is to install it in one of the case plugs
near the idiot light sender.  This would mean getting shavings into the case
so the best time to do this is when the engine is apart.  Right now we are
running our temp, pressure and idiot light on a brass T-fitting were the idiot
light sender goes.  We have to machine the T-fitting to take all three senders
and when installed we make sure that the temp sender it is the upper position
so it gets all the heat coming into the fitting.  Eric &amp; Barb
