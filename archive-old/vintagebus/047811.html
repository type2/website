Hi Thom,
If it is a slow leak or seep then it probably is the seal.  If it was the 
bearing not seated the oil would tend to pour out while just sitting!  We 
have not had to deal with the Mexican seals so far (Fortunitly or 
unfortunitly!) since we stocked up on Brazilian ones for .50 each at Pomona 
years ago.  The only time we have had problems with these sealing was when 
the inner race that runs inside of the seal had a slight groove worn into it. 
 Had to dig around to find a better condition race to replace that one.
