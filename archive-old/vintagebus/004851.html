&gt;     2 screws heads stripped, keeping me from removing one gate....How
should
&gt; I best handle this?
&gt;

Drill them out. Being Phillips head screws, it is nearly impossible to drill
them off center. The major diameter of the screws is 8mm (5/16 in.), the
minor diameter is 6.75mm (17/64 in.) , drill them progressively starting
with the largest drill that will go all the way down in the center of the
Phillips X and stopping when you get to 17/64. This should just leave the
coil of the threads themselves. If they don't come out, you may have to get
an M8x1.25 tap and tap them out.
