Subject: Sticky Shift Rod help

Usual story, sticky shift rod.  Getting almost unbearable.  I usually disconnect it and pull it out the front as far as possible to clean.  I am to lazy to drop the tranny and do it correctly.  Seems to work for a while.
 
This time I thought of a different idea.  What if I pull the shift rod out from the front as far as possible then cut the center portion out of the shift rod tube.  Leaving about 1 ft or so on each end for support the rod and bushing.  This would allow me to easily clean the whole rod w.o dropping the tranny.  I could put a rubber boot on the center openings to try to keep the bushings clean.
 
Seem obvious and easy to me.  That is why I am wondering what may be a problem that I have overlooked.
