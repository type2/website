Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing Front Trans mount

Hello Guys   The way I have changed this mount is to use a screw jack with a 
block of wood to push the tranny back far enough to remove the mount. You must 
remove the wires at the starter and the clutch and trottle cables. You do not 
have to undo the redux   box bolts but you do have to remove the bottom mount 
bolts with the motor and tranny suported with a jack set so that it will 
roll. like on a piece of thick plywood or floor.  For cheap jackstands get some 
metal milk crates and 4x4 pieces of wood long enough to spand the crate do not 
use the inner section but spand all the way across the crate. Only problem 
might be the ground  then you must also put something under the crate.  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
