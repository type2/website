Subject: Re: [VB] how popular are crew cabs?

Could depend on where you are located.  Here on the rusty mid-Atlantic 
East Coast they are few and far between.  We just had a big regional VW 
show in northern VA and I was surprised to see two or three very nice 
splitty doublecabs (and one singlecab) in the judging this time.  (As 
long as you don't object to diamondplate bed/gate lining.)  Plus a 
couple of the swappers usually carry their stuff in DCs.

Whenever I bring my DC to a show I invariably hear a few comments of 
&quot;this is great, I used to have one of these and I loved it&quot; from a few 
of the old-timers. (Well, somewhat older than me, anyway.)  I bought a 
heavy rubber pickup truck mat that I trimmed down to size for the bed, 
whenever I need to haul landscaping bricks or bags of manure or 
whatever.  I just pull it up whenever I want to show off.

&gt; I got a calendar from my local VW dealer this year &amp; June features a ~sweet~
&gt; crew cab bus.
&gt; I don't think I've ever seen but a few and was curious how available they
&gt; are.
&gt; Does anyone on the list have one?
&gt; Just curious,
