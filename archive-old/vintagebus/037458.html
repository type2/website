 I liked Joe's thoughts on rust colored primer and Ford pickups.But that is
something to think about.  I've driven VW's around with primer on them, back
as a kid fly'n primer was cool.  But with in a couple of months things started
to get ugly.  But now with the great advances in primers, you can fly it to
for  at least two to three years with no worries. It's called epoxy primer, it
is pretty much a primer-sealer.  It can also be laid on thicker than any
lacquer type primer I've ever seen.  This stuff is great for lazy people that
work a spot at a time.  The main disadvantages are cost and pot life.  Another
good product but spendy is Vari-prime.  This stuff is full of zinc.  Zinc has
the wonderful ability to turn rust into a black oxide.  The black oxide cover
the rust block out air.  So when you get that little rock chip, it stays a
little rock chip!  I fully recomend this stuff for front ends.  But it is a
must for heavy rust repair!  Even with sand blasting you just sometimes get it
all.
Peace, Love, and remember those safety glasses and respirators!
