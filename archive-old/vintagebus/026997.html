Subject: hand brake removal

Hi-
Bentley simply describes the removal of the hand brake.  WHen I got to
the part that said &quot;remove the pin&quot; that's where I ran into problems.
The pin being the axis in which the hand brake pivots.  I could not even
get it to squeak!  Of course I removed the clips on both sides.

Does anyone have any pointers???  I do not recall seeing the pin OUT of
it's spot...  Is there a special way to push, twist or pull?

TIA
Mark
