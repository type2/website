I also had an idea for fixing rocker panels, at least under the doors. It 
seems to me that, once fixed, this problem of rust is likley to reaccur 
because water collects in this area. My idea is to use &quot;sign foam&quot;. It is 
a material used in the sign industry. It can be carve with ease. By 
making a cuved block of this stuff and epoxying it in, there would be no 
place for moisture to collect, ever. I am still thinking about this one, 
because I would like my bus to be as original as possible, but the idea 
of curing this problem FOREVER may induce me to sacrifice my purist 
leanings.

I dont get it- if it is rusting through at the door sill, stepping on spray
foam is not very sturdy.    Spray foam itself will not rust, but everything it
touchs will .   It does somehow.   I have seen the results.
