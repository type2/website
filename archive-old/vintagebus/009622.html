&gt;&gt;In the book &quot;how to hotrod volkswagen engines&quot;, the author
&gt;mentions, in the blueprinting chapter, a method for cleaning
&gt;up mating surfaces on the engine case, particulatly around
&gt;studs and bolt holes, to make them flat.  The method is
&gt;'stoneing' or 'stoneing down' the surface.
&gt;
&gt;My question is, what are these 'stones' and where can they
&gt;be found?
&gt;

It's a machinist thing. They are stones just like the ones used for
sharpening knives. For this purpose, it is helpful if they are not all worn
and uneven. A new, large 'bench' stone, which is about 3/4 x 2 x 6 inches,
is nice for this sort of thing. You can get a cheap one at Harbor Freight or
the like, with different grits on the opposite sides. Just make sure you
flush/blow out any grit after you finish.
