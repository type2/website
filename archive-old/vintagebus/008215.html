Subject: got the flywheel on - thanks

Yay.  Well, after some more fiddling with it,  (I realized the flywheel lock
was still on and interfering) I got the endplay set.  Took the motor
outside, torqued down the gland nut... and it started to rain.  Damn.
Covered the motor up really well.  Guess it'll have to wait.  Oh well,
another couple days won't hurt.  Thanks for the advice everyone.
Diana
