Subject: wiper motor wiring part 2
Date: Mon, 29 Jan 2001 20:21:39 -0600

   Ok, I've got a 12V 67 wiper motor. It has 3 wires plus ground. When I put
12 V on the high speed I get 12V fed back through on the park wire (a big
assumption that it is the park wire on my part). and 7V on the low speed
lead.
   When I put 12 V on the low speed and I get 12V fed back through on the
park and high speed leads. Is this normal? According to the wiring diagram
for a 67 all 4 wires are hooked up to the switch. Does the switch handle
this feed back voltage somehow or does it just not go anywhere and dead ends
on the switch.
   There are a lot of original wires that are melted under the dash. I don't
want to take a chance and melt the replacement ones already there. Right
now, everything works except the rear blinkers. But I don't think the rear
blinkers are hooked up at all.
   The original flasher relay has been replace with an after market one.

Thanks again

Rick
