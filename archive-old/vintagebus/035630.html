ever noticed that in those movies that have sequels they keep something
hanging to get you to spend more dough to see the next movie?  Well, I am
working on that principle.   Once in a while someone writes and says they like
what I write, but what do people respond on the list about?  Freakin coffee
holders.  So I bow to peer pressure.   I too can talk about cup holders.

The cup holders in this 65 are attached to the door with screws through the
door panels.  (one per side)  The claw bit to hold the cup flips up, and the
flat bit the cup rests on flips down.  Voila.   I don't know that this is the
idea set up, and I don't like drilling extra holes, but it does work.

Oh so to backtrack a little, at this rally in Montana people keep asking me
questions re parts.  Heck I don't know nothing.  I'm the dumb blond.  Ask him.
I purposely resisting getting into it. But it seemed a higher percentage of
people at that event were open to the idea of a woman being informed on the
parts than at a VW event.  FWIW.  Maybe because it was an older crowd in
general than the VW things, and that with time one becomes more open to
things.  Who knows?

So we left Missoula on Sunday, and spent a couple hard long days
junkyarding/parts collecting Mon and Tues.   It was hot and dirty and I
questioned my sanity.  I found a perfect engine lid in the correct (Sealing
Wax Red) colour for my 61 to replace the funky one on there.  Chris got a
nicec sunroof assembly for his 61 bug. And a pair of correct front doors for
it.   Found all sorts of wiersd stuff.  Nice dry heater boxes, too, hard to
get in Oly those are.    The bus was full of stuff, and the roof rack was
piled high.  Remember how this is a lowered bus?    It was rubbing the front
tires bad after tuesday, so we moved a bunch of weight to the back.   Not so
bad after that.   

I do not recommend lowering a bus particularly if it is to be used as a
hauler. 

   This guy was dragging the taillpipe and the tow hitch, and rubbed the
steering box sometimes too.    It is 6 and a half inches lower than Nellie (my
65) and I'd bang my head once in a while.  On the other hand, I have to climb
in to my 61 corner window bus.   It is a tad higher than Nellie, as it has 15&quot;
rims rather than 14&quot;s.  To be clear, I must say this does not happen when not
laden, though he has to be careful about bumps and driveways, or can scrape
something.

So Wednesday we head back to Oly- and somewhere in the desert I say let's stop
so i can collect some sagebrush. (Artemesia)  So we pull over and notice this
bad smell and smoke coming from the right rear brake.   Eek.  And it was a
hundread degrees out.  Ok.   Jacked it up and it dragged.  Bled it, it bled
fine.   Brake is sticking. Did I mention it has 4 wheel disc brakes?  So he
pulled it apart  and found the sticking part and unstuck it and lubed it, and
looked under and found the brake hose had been installed twisted, and had a
bulb on one side.  (brake hoses were less than two years old).   So untwisted
it and the brakes no longer dragged.   And the brakes worked better than they
ever had.  And the bus rolled easier too.  That was fun.   ANyway, I had a few
sage sticks I twisted up with braided grass out of the
stop.

So make sure your rubber hoses are not installed twisted.

Got back to Oly about quarter past nine pm, it was still light.   It felt good
to be home.  We were tired- a lot of driving, a lot of heat, the rally was
more work than expected, the parts scrounging hours were intense, and I was
welcoming seeing my house and cat and sleeping in.

 Thursday morning we were woken up by heavy machinery at 6am.  The forest
behind my house had been clearcut (about 17 acreas had) last July, and now
they were pulling the stumps out.  But Jay sus.   6 am.   And they had parked
the machinery right by my house. They were doing a burn pile, too, but that
was further back, the idea was to toss the stumps on the pile and burtn them.
So I throw on a robe and stomped out through the dirt  to give them a piece of
my mind.

Unloaded the VW parts from the bus, and organised what of it to take to the
show, cleaned stuff up, and loaded up my 61 'Montana' for the shows that
weekend.  More of the same on Friday, and Chris &amp; Irene &amp; I headed up in two
buses Fri pm to the community college where the Vintage meet was to be.
(for those who were there, his bus was the green/white 65 parked next to my
red/white corner window in the swap area).  I had organised to help with set
up, so did some of that, had dinner, and went to sleep.

saturday the show was really nice.  the people were nice, the cars were nice.
I met a few listees, did some swapping.   Mark Smith and Mark Lapriore showed
up to swap in a pair of barndoors, a 54 and a 51 respectively.  the 51 was so
freakin cool.  It was rusty on the bottom and had TV/Radio repair on it, kinda
lightish blue.  It had all these parts different from my 53.   I think it was
# 20- 10 xxx, very early.  The piano hinge vent windows, the latches on the
pop outs were different, the vertical place below the front seat weher the
heat/choke control are is different.   Really cool bus. They were so pieced
togetehr, it is such a wierd idea to restore a cheap delivery van.   And went
to the post meet club barbecue, where I saw how shiny Bob Freeman's 54's paint
was, caressably smooth, much more so than a new beetle with 79 miles on it.
Better than new.  Relaxed, good food, refreshments, &amp; company.

Drove back to Oly for the night, and got up to go to the Bug In at S.I.R the
next day.  Ofcourse I decide to adjust the fan belt on the 61, and for some
reason the threads on the generator got a bit screwy and it took an hour
instead of a few minutes.   S I R was drag races and more of that stuff.  

Anyway, Usually I'm a bit more relaxed, but had gone through a certain amount
of sleep deprivation, so I hope no one thought I was rude.    

anyway, there is more to come in part three of the trip report, including some
results of my rpm investigations.   No rest for the wicked.
