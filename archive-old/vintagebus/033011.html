Subject: 66 only 6 volt gererator wanted
To: &lt;&quot;vintage bus&quot;_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0
Message-ID: &lt;47.8f4d4b8.27e82e67_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi list,

I am looking for a good used or rebuildable 66 only 6 volt generator for my daily driver bus.  I have my reasons why I do not want to convert to 12 volt, so don't even try to sway me.
as long as I am asking, does anyone have any new or good used 66 only voltage regulators too?
contact me off the list please.
Neil Pickett
currently putting out 5.34 volts and charging the battery every other day in the Chicago area.
