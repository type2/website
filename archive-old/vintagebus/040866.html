&gt;
&gt;Seriously though, I've expericenced this before. The front end on this
&gt;Barndoor bounces up and down like crazy when going over medium to large
&gt;dips but handles most small bumps fine. Now I'm thinking that the shocks
&gt;are gone and the torsion bars aren't able to stop from working as soon
&gt;as they should. What are the thoughts from you guys?
&gt;

My understanding is that shocks do little or nothing for the initial bump,
they reduce the tendency to continue to bounce up and down after the bump.
