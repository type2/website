&gt; 'i'm taking my toys and going home.'

No, it's not that at all. I've repeated myself so many times that it's
gotten old. It's the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing, but
expecting a different result each time. I can only repeat myself so many
times before I have to say to myself &quot;I'm wasting my time&quot;.

Take for example a message posted on Sunday about using the DTM shroud. I'm
reapeating myself again when I reply to it and say &quot;Yes, those are great
shrouds, but you still have the issue of the stock louvers on the side of
the bus being a restriction&quot;. I've been saying that all along, how many more
times should I say it and repeat myself so that i'm not accused of &quot;taking
my toys and going home&quot;?

This is what I meant when I said &quot;i'm done with it&quot;.
