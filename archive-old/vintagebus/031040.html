&gt; well... thats the fault of the person/company that is reproing the parts.
&gt; maybe the genuises should omit the logo in the molds. copyright laws are
&gt; pretty simple:
&gt; LOGO or TM'd NAME + USING WITHOUT PERMISSION = NO, NO
&gt; its not rocket science. i would sue too!

&gt;

Woah, wait a minute.  Most of the images you have on the T shirts you are
selling are from VW trademarked promotional brochures!  That means you are
violating  VW's copyright.  Have you obtained a license to reproduce those
images?  Are you sending royalties back to VW?  Sure you haven't used the blue
V over W logo anywhere, but the point is you are using unauthorized
images....no?

What's to stop VW from next deciding that they do not want ANY images of their
old air-cooled product reproduced...ANYWHERE!  Makes sense to me (the
marketing guys muses).  &quot;Why let people use any of our copyrighted images?  We
only want people to think of our new products.  We only make money off of the
sale and service of our new products&quot;.    Where would &quot;splitwindow_dot_com&quot; be
with out any images of split window VWs???



&gt;
&gt; URL trafficing is what i dont agree with. why do some of you vintage guys
&gt; (gals) take it so personally?

Freedom...any freedom, erodes one small piece at a time.  You don't notice it
at first, but before you know it, it is completely gone.  Freedom is VERY
personal to me.
