Count me/us (wife and I) in on that little adventure. We're in Manchester
New Hampshire and could offer a half way resting point.

&gt; Subject: Year 2000 Trip Proposal
&gt; Date: Monday, November 09, 1998 11:44 AM
&gt; 
&gt; All in the spirit of &quot;driving our beloved units&quot; I would like to propose
&gt; for consideration and organization the following journey for the year
2000:
&gt; 
&gt; {{{{Washington DC to New Foundland}}}}}
&gt; 
&gt; Justification:  The west coast bussers are already planning the Tierra
Del
&gt; Fuego (spelling??) trip so why not at the same time provide the east
coast
&gt; volks folks with another way to go.  
&gt; 
&gt; Not to mention the fact that we would not be running the risk of having
&gt; auto-shooters shoved in our faces by some Central American dude dressed
in
&gt; camo that loves the sight of American blood oozing from the body of an
&gt; American body with a set of German set of bus keys tightly wrapped in
their
&gt; dying hand.  (Certainly don't mean to put a negative spin on that little
&gt; adventure.) : )
&gt; 
&gt; No, we would only be confronted with the beauty of the French Canadians
&gt; that have not yet grown so violently hateful, even though some of them do
&gt; not appreciate their southern North American neighbors.  They do like our
&gt; dollars though.
&gt; 
&gt; We would not have to have our busses shipped back.  Nor would we have to
&gt; sell them upon arrival and then fly back crying like babes over the loss
of
&gt; our dearly departed loaf or micro.  We could just turn around and head
for
&gt; home sweet home (mechanics allowing of course).  
&gt; 
&gt; Time:  Sometime during the spring of 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody interested???
