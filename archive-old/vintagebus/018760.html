The big aluminum one that went where the window should have been? :)

&gt; That is, the &quot;volkswagen&quot; script which, I understand,
&gt; is same as a type 3 for some years.

It's &quot;bright dipped&quot; which wears off after a while.  You can
bust out the polish and clean it up, but it will dull out again
with exposure.  Some people buff them up and then clear coat them -
you can try that.
