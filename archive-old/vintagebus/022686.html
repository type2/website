Subject: [VB] Inner Cargo Rocker Support Question...
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19991225221802.00c442c0_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

How in the heck does the inner cargo rocker section fit in?  I've been
playing with it for the last hour trying to figure it out...

I spent xmas sectioning in the lower portion of the other bashed cargo
door, then cutting away the rotted driver's side rocker.  I have the inner
channel welded in, but I'm stymied by the support piece.
