Hi All,

I'm desperately seeking a reasonably nice set of original safaris so I can
take by 59 double cab off to the paint shop....  I live out in the middle of
no where so it's hard to take in many (if not any) swap meets...

I have cash ready!!!
Willing to fork it over....
Please please please please please...

(do I sound desperate enough???)
(hey, that's even in haiku!)

Email me direct.

Thanks

David
