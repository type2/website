Subject: bad brakes

I had tie rods replaced at a local shop and haven't really driven my bus =
much since.  Then today I applied the brakes and my bus really pulled to =
the right. =20

I don't really have time to look at it until next weekend when I'm =
planning a tune up and oil change - but does anyone have any ideas as to =
why my bus would pull to one side like that. I guess a brake adjustment =
is the first thing to try but I thought I'd ask.

Thanks
