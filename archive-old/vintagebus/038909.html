Most of the time I use an impact with 250lbs to loosen fasteners. When that
won't do or to tighten, when I am never in a hurry, I use a flex handle with
a adapter to 1/2inch, impact hardened.
I then sleeve the flex handle with a close fitting pipe as a handle 2,3 or 5
ft long, it was a cheap way to get away with using 1/2 sockets almost
everywhere. The 3/4 bar; it's so old I can't read it, I think becasue of the
taper on the handle, it's a MAC? That, with an adapter works great on the
1/2 sockets, and my torque wrench is always sure to fit on all my sockets
(the biggest ones I have anyway,now finally the 46mm I needed, thanks to
Snap On. They are a little pricey for me to ever consider a whole set from
them though. When I worked in the Ch3vy sh0p, a wrencher there had a Snap On
box in teal with a 40th Year Corvette Painting on it, plus beacoup tools,
must have been nice.... I will check into Proto if I snap mine ever though.

Thinking
of 1/2 drive snap on one
 available. It has a depth of 29.7 mm. &gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
We measured the right rear axle and nut on our 1960 panel camper conversion
with 1966-67 suspension in it.  The nut and tip of the stub axle is 24mm so
the socket depth you are looking at will work fine.  We just hope the 1/2
drive holds up to the task!  We used to use Craftsman 1/2&quot; drive breaker
bars
and snapped them off easily.  Then went to 3/4&quot; Craftsman breaker bars and
still bent and eventually snapped one after another off.  The only breaker
bar we have not been able to bend let alone break is the Proto 3/4&quot; breaker
bar and it is only about $10.00 more than the Craftsman 3/4&quot; breaker bar.
