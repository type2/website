&lt;&lt; They are round and of similar design to the stock early mirrors, but they 
are about an inch or two larger in diameter.  The mirror glass is the cool 
part.  They are slightly convex and have a larger field of view.  They were 
said to be for busses, but the mounts are slightly too large.   &gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
Sounds like the Barjon (SP?) mirrors one can pick up at truck stops!  Do they
