&gt; Guys,
&gt;
&gt; Please don't take this the wrong way, but I think you need to try to
&gt; find a way to accept your Bus for who he/she/it is and enjoy these
&gt; little inconveniences,
&gt; Should you improve your bus? YES! Better brakes,bigger engine,seatbelts,
&gt; Great.Make it safer and more fun to drive,but try to keep as many of the
&gt; wierd original features as you can. Or buy a newer Bus.
&gt;
&gt; No offense, just my opinion.

No offense taken Dave.
 On one hand I agree with you totally.  I love all the things that are
unique to my bus that make it more than &quot;just a car&quot; and something that
no-one else understands.  I enjoy people going &quot;Oh wow swinging doors&quot;
and &quot;Look at those cute little tail lights&quot;.
But on the other hand I enjoy a few of the &quot;mod-cons&quot;.  I no longer have
the original radio (it wasnt in there when I got it anyway), I replaced
it with a kick ass Blaupunkt system (at least I kept it German), I have
an alarm and immobiliser with dual stage shock sensors and microwave
movement detectors (I could have used the door pin switches instead if
there were some - another special v.w. feature) to keep what's mine as
mine, the interior has been reupholstered in crushed velour.
There is no way that I could do anything like alter the ride height, or
drop in a bigger engine or anything like that.
I do enjoy my bus for all it's peculiarities, but I do enjoy some
luxuries aswell

Daniel
