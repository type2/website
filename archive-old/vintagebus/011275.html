In a message dated 98-10-21 12:47:22 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 1)  I'm considering putting a 15 amp fuse on the + feed wire that goes to
 the coil.  As I understand it, this is unfused in the splits and was fused
 on the type1 loafs? &gt;&gt;

Hi Stephen,
In all of our pre-1968 buses this is fused.  Try this with your bus.  Start
engine and remove each of the fuses and see if the engine stops.

&lt;&lt;2)  My wiper in my '63 crew has blown a white fuse twice.  Both times in the
morning when it was cold.  Wipers work fine during day and in other tests...
but when I need them to keep condensation off, they blow :)  Given that my
bus was converted to 12v -- and the wiper goes pretty slow .  My question is
pretty simple -- is a white fuse just under AMPs for a 12v converted wiper?&gt;&gt;

Yes the white fuse is correct for your wiper.  First clean all the electrical
connections.  Then if that does not do the trick and/ or the wipers are really
noisy you probably need to remove your wiper motor and clean out the wiper
gear box of old grease that has turned into puddy.  Keep a eye out for a warpy
washer against one of the two gears so you can reinstall it where it belongs.
After cleaning the old grease down replace it with clear or white grease and
only put in enough grease to fill the gear box only 1/4-1/3 full.  Using too
heavy of grease or too much of even the light grease will cause the motor to
turn too slow when cold and possibly blow the fuse or burn/wear out the wiper
motor.      Eric &amp; Barb
