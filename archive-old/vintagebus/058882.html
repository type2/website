Subject: RE: [VB] Flip seat Westy/ M code help

  Thank you Jon, you verified the color combo. This bus is painted all white
on the inside with the lower half turquoise after the white was painted. You
should pass all this info to Everett so he can update his site on the SK
paint codes

i don't believe that &quot;SK&quot; means sikkens paint. i 
think it is a german abbreviation for special color combination, for 2 main 
reasons. first, every bus i have seen that has &quot;SK&quot; has been painted from
the 
factory uniquely in some way that is different from the &quot;normal&quot; way they 
painted a bus. example: my 61 flipseat (and jp's) everything, including the 
interior, was the lower body color, and only the OUTSIDE above the beltline
was 
white. this is in contrast to say a standard that would be say blue/white,
where 
the interior would be white.

second: can you imagine the factory having to 
change the paint in the spray booths every single time an &quot;SK&quot; bus came 
through?

i have an original flipseat paint color brochure 
which specifies the &quot;SK&quot; combinations/number designations for those 
particular busses. SK 1023 is specified as (body color)turquoise/(roof
color) 
blue white.

 

 

 Another thing. I looked at Everetts site for the colors 
and at the pics of


the bus again and it appears that the color code SK 1023 is white upper 
with

a sky blue? lower. This was determined by the inside of the engine lid 
and

doors. Has anyone ever seen this combination before and are Sikkens 
pait

colors all special order?
