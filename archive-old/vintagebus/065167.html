&gt;      I remember as a kid (I'm 24) a custom single cab

Napa?  Near the coast?  Fairly moderate temperatures, right?  if the temps
don't get too hot you can get away with a lot, but don't take a trip to
the hot country.

  Also it seems most drag bugs have the lids
&gt; removed.

They go a quarter mile at a time.  Many of them dispense with the entire
cooling system, shroud and all!  Not the same situation as a bus.

  Plus all the sandrails and buggies have
&gt; completely exposed engines.

The key word here is &quot;completely&quot;.  They don't have a body to redirect the
hot air back into the engine bay.

&gt;      If I remove the engine lid will it help the
&gt; engine run cooler?

No.

&gt; If it is beteer to leave it on,
&gt; how would louvers, a whole bunch, or small amout
&gt; change the airflow?

They certainly would.  They would allow hot air from under the engine to
recirculate into the engine bay.

  I have an extra lid, so I can
&gt; leave one nice.  Who knows about the aerodynamics of
&gt; the engine bay?

Just make sure that all the seals are in place in the engine bay and that
all the proper tin is present.  Then your bus will cool fine.
Save that extra lid, someone will need it.
