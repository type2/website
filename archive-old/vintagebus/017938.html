&gt; On another vehicle list I am on this very discussion
Quoting a previous message:
  The conclusion is that some decades ago,  some
&gt; engine builders deliberately left their cases
&gt; outside to weather for a while before doing the
final
&gt; machining.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know what difference if would be for magnesium
&gt; as  opposed
&gt; to whatever version of iron they used, but it made
&gt; the  cases more stable &amp; less prone to distortion as
a result of the  machining.

To the best of my knowledge, the weathering is done
with cast iron items (still done with the better
quality power tool castings, such as table saws and
jointers) before final machining to let some internal
stresses relieve themselves.  Never heard of it being
done with magnesium, but I haven't heard of lots of
things. &lt;G&gt;
