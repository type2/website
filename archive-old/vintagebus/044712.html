Uhhh....you have two choices.
The 5 or the 101.
Its not THAT hard to get to LA LA land.
Everett has both flyers for the shows posted on his website.
Along with addresses.
AAA_dot_com and yahoo, or mapquest, etc. have directions.

&lt;&lt;Thom, on top of directions, I totally recommend running past your local AAA
for some maps.  This is also my first drive to LA (waits for the flame to
creep up from that area) and I am double check and triple checking
everything from ideal routes to elevation changes to gas stops.  :)  Is
that overkill?
