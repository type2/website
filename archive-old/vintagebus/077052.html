Subject: Re: [VB] Removing Tie Rods- cool tools

The tool you WANT is Hazet #779. Not cheap, about 80
bucks or so, but it works GREAT, and you can even use
it for the front drag link end without any problems
due to the tight space. It's adjustable for different
heights.
Basically, I've had one for years, and can't even
imagine NOT owning one.
I can get them if anyone is interested, drop me an
email.
