thom I have a set of those floor halves 
good - they are thick and the stampings are OK
bad - they are not quite full, there is no lip in the front and there is a
gap in the middle of a couple of inches.
I dont know if he has changed them.
Donor is better. I know in your case with the BD RHD thats not very likely
but
modifying a LHD set might still be a better solution.
