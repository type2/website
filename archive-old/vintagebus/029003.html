Steering wheel spinners are legal in more states than illegal, but since
you've received a ticket for it, would bet your state is one of the
illegal ones.  Would have to check the legality of allowing certain
persons, operators, and not allowing others, seems discriminatory to me.

In addition to the spinners, have the horn button with clock, rayon kind
of material vallet which fits the rectangular area above the interior
rear view mirror, busface pins in colors, crying bus buttons, and am
working on a cassette tape holder which fits between the dash and parcel
tray.  

If interested let me know as I don't have many of any of them as they
take a bit of time to make and I work as well.

Thanks in advance.
