&gt;&gt; He is just doing the canvas. It's nice, and works, but it's not 100% original
&gt;&gt; looking. Wrong hardware, wrong colored grommets, and the wrong colored
&gt;&gt; canvas.
&gt;&gt; But for $500 they be good to &quot;use&quot; If I was going to spend the money I'd buy
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; from Dawn at PLF for a little more that was correct.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the critique on my new canvases!  Here's a little insight on why my
&gt; canvases look the way they do:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Wrong hardware: The strap clips to hold the rolled up canvas in place are
&gt; stronger off the shelf tent clips.  I am in the process of having exact
&gt; replicas of the og clips fabricated.  The &quot;J&quot; clips in the front are a
&gt; stainless steel replica(read more expensive) of the original clips that are
&gt; painted.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  wrong colored grommets: I believe the hardware is german oem but has a
&gt; color coating for Swiss Army vehicles. I can remove this color before
&gt; installation if desired by the purchaser.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  wrong colored canvas:  Not sure what you mean by this. The canvas is #8
&gt; duck canvas, the same canvas as on the og canvas I gave to my fabricator to
&gt; match.  These canvases are brand new, and have not weathered yet like your SC
&gt; canvas at Red Barn? Or maybe you were talking about the green canvas webbing
&gt; on the eyelet straps?  On the back side of the og canvas I used for a pattern,
&gt; the webbing was not faded like the front of the webbing.  It appeared to have
&gt; been a dark green color originally, so we matched it for a little more
&gt; authenticity? The og canvas I matched had a green thread running along the
&gt; bottom of the side and rear panels.  I have seen that same thread in different
&gt; colors.  I wonder if other canvases had matching thread/webbing?  You will
&gt; also notice that the original VW magazine ad showing the rear of a truck w/ a
&gt; canvas, had a hook strap at the top that was definitely much darker than the
&gt; canvas it was sewed on.(black and white ad?) In any event, I can install any
&gt; color straps the purchaser desires.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  $500 price:     I am actually selling both DC and SC canvases for the same
&gt; price of $550.00 + shipping if required.(Dawn's are $750 for a DC, and $800
&gt; for a SC I believe)
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Yes, these canvases are made to be used on trucks which are DRIVEN, which
&gt; is something I am really big on.
&gt; 
&gt; 6.  Buy one from Dawn:  The only reason I even got into making canvases, was
&gt; because I wanted to order one from PLF, but she wasn't taking any orders, and
&gt; as far as I know, still isn't. (Dawn, speak up if I'm wrong!!) I talked to
Dawn at Red Barn, and fully
&gt; support her in handmaking canvases.  My canvases are made by a large canvas
&gt; tent making company which has the equipment, experience, and knowledge to make
&gt; an excellent product at a reasonable cost, and in larger quantities, even
&gt; though each one is also hand made.  The only difference in mass producing the
&gt; canvases, is in cutting out the patterns in multiples instead of one at a
&gt; time.  All the other sewing is done individually, but in an assembly line,
&gt; probably like VW actually did it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for the critique on my canvases.  It is my intent to provide the
&gt; most &quot;vintage nazi&quot; like canvas that I can.  However, i will not be providing
&gt; any &quot;slammed&quot; canvases even though I have been requested to do so!
