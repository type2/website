Subject: SO-42 interior panels
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all,
Having completed body work/paint on Frodo my 65 Westy I set about to work
on the interior. Luck was with me. My interior panels were complete but unusable.
They were remove about 2 years ago during my decontamination work (full of mice
and all). I saved them expecting to use them as templates. Little did I know how 
critical they would be. The panels do not have square corners. They are tapered.
I discovered this when I was cutting the replacement 5'x5' birch panels. It 
dawned on me that if anybody out there did not have originals to work from 
cutting tight fitting replacements would be nearly impossible. I have deceided 
to create measured drawings of the roof and side panels from my originals. I thought 
about modeling the rest of the interior in 3-D but thats another project entirely.
If anyone is interested let me know. I will make it web accessable as soon as I am done. 
Maybe we could add a page to Thom's site with paneling blueprints.
