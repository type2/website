Why is it that every time we get a thread going about
mods to buses, it has to get so ugly so fast?

I realize that I'm partially to blame for posting my
tongue in cheek comments about welding up the westy
hatch and making a birdhouse with the cabinets.

*Please* keep your comments civil and reasonable.  Don't
post anything on the list that you wouldn't say out loud 
at the family dinner table.

We've hashed the lowering/chopping thread *way* too much.

And I'm glad the SC got sold - let's hope it's to a good,
loving home.  If anyone's interested, I know of another
'58 SC in my neighborhood that is for sale - please contact
me off-line.

Thank you.
