I bet wal-marts across the land are experiencing similar bum-rushes of
toy-crazed VW folx.

I wonder if other enthusiast groups are as rabid; there seem to be be an
excess of viper and corvett toys on the shelf.  Either their enthusiasts
don't buy as many, or Dodge &amp; GM pay to have extras made.
