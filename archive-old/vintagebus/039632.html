I found one place on the web in Michigan or the like that will custom mix 
and rattle can load paint... don't know anything about quality since I opted 
out of that direction when I realized a full repaint was called for (or 
wanted).  If you are Northern CA there is a place in Vacaville that will do 
this also.  They carry Valspar but might pack a paint if you supply it... 
Paradise Paints if you need it.

&gt;Before I got a auto body supply store to mix up a batch of real L87, I
&gt;had some success using a 5oz. rattle can of Dupli-Color 'Creme' from a
&gt;FLAPS to repaint the battery area on my DC and touch up some spots on
&gt;the backseat floor.  Doing a highly visible outer body scratch with this
&gt;might be a different matter, however.  Also, try your local Sherwin
&gt;Williams paint store.  They have 12oz. rattle cans of 3 or 4 spray
&gt;enamel colors approaching L87, for example, 'Antique White'.
&gt;
&gt;BTW some auto body supply stores will mix up real L87 and put it in
&gt;rattle cans for you.  Inquire locally, as they say...

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a reasonable match to L87 Pearl White that is
&gt; &gt; available in a rattle can?  Something in an over the counter spray from
&gt; &gt; a FLAP that I can use for a quickie touch up.  Likewise for L82 Silver
&gt; &gt; White.
