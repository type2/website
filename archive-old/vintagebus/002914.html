O.K. all you electrican types, heres one for you ( not really ) .

Question:  My alternator seems to have the bearing going out ( whine and
grinding sound ).  It just started a day or so ago so, what do I do?  Is it
something I can replace myself?

I'm not bad with tools and such having bu9ilt several engines but, the
electricals are an area I am lost in so, HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jon
