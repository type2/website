Subject: Re: [VB] Bigger Brake Problems

You can bleed the brakes by cracking the line open where the brake line
goes into the wheel cylinder. It's not as good as using the bleeder
valve, but it can get you on the road in a pinch. You'll be able to get
all the air out of the line, but there could still be a little in the
wheel cylinder doing it that way.

The broken bleeder valve will be pretty easy to fix. It already has a
hole in the middle of it for the fluid to flow through, so you can just
tap an easy out into it and remove the broken piece. Do this after the
stress meter has backed of a little. Easy outs are also &quot;easy breaks&quot; so
you need to be unstressed when you try this.

Have fun 8^)

&gt; I still have not figured out my brake peddle assembly but went ahead and
&gt; tried to bleed the brakes and managed to break the bleeder screw off of
&gt; the front passenger side.  Needless to say my stress meter just pegged.
&gt; As if that isn't enough, the skies just opened up and put a stop on
&gt; getting this done anytime some.  So what does one do when the bleeder
&gt; screw breaks off.  Tap it out?  Get it towed to someone who knows what
&gt; they are doing?  I'm pretty much screwed getting to work tomorrow unless
&gt; I can find a ride from a co-worker.  This is not the fun filled weekend
&gt; I had planned for.
