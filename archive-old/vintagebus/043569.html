Hello all....

I am in need of some assistance via private mail or list. I removed the
engine (code AH) from my 59 panel as well as the transmission.

I need to get inside the case. All the bolts are off but it doesn't appear
to be coming apart without what feels like excessive force. How do I take
apart the transmission. 

Why am I doing this?

No one in town will touch the transmission. Not even the local VW guru. I
was told to send it somewhere in California. 
I pulled the drain plugs out and about 1/4 cup if that of fluid came out.
Obviously this bus experienced a major episode of fluid loss, heat
build up and what not and really sounds bad if you try and drive it:)
It does shift and move in all gears.

Right now although it can be transformed into a nice bus, I'm sort of
feeling like I purchased a chicken coup but that is ok. So long as I can
sit all proud and putt around proud one day all is still good.

Other discoveries and work done thus far.
 
- pulled apart reduction boxes all are ok.
- seperated tranny from engine
- noticed flywheel on engine had dented tooth sides but all edges are
square
- noticed metal shavings where engine has machines the tranny case a
little.
- 

Why can't I look at the bently? I'm trying to get one ordered for less
than 160 cdn dollars:) in any condition. I'm not trying to be cheap but
getting this thing rolling out of my friends garage is of fairly high
importance. heh. I'll be ordering up a book from somewhere next week.

 So....

1. I need to be told how to seperate the case w/o breaking anything.
-so I can check for obviously busted bits, excessive play, and clean this
thing up before filling it with fluid if it appears to be fine. Also I
have a second transmission of the same type that could use the same
treatment and analysis for donor parts.

 2. don't laugh too hard guys.

...again pardon the poorly written email. I'm definately living the
cartoon scenario in the idiots guide with parts everywhere. 8|
