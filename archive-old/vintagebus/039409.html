     I have a few somewhat &quot;rare&quot; bus parts and I would like to get an idea 
of what they may be worth.I have a set of Empi front steps that are in 
pretty good shape only a few cracks in the rubber.I also have a nice pair of 
deluxe bumper trim (front).I am interested in trading them for some parts I 
really need, so if you guys can give me any Ideas I would appreciate it.

                                                       Carl in Alaska,
                                                    65 13 window deluxe
