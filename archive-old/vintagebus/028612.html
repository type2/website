Subject: Another Bus Rescue

Hi List,

As one of the silent majority on the list, I thought I should speak up.
One of the aspects of this list that I enjoy the most are the
restoration stories. After reading about the adventures of No Quarter
and others, I created a site documenting my progress in getting another
bus, a '65 Hardtop DeLuxe, back on the road and it's eventual
restoration.

This bus and a '65 EZ-Camper were saved from a field here in Colorado.
The fellow who actually saved them is keeping the camper and put the
DeLuxe up for sale. That's when I stepped into the picture. Right now we
are in the middle of getting a new title on it. The original has been
lost. What a pain in the neck! This was something that I had always
wondered about, so I will cover this process in depth on the site. I
hope it will be useful info for some of you. I'll be adding more
bureaucratic info about the process as we jump through the hoops.

So take a look and let me know what you think. This is my first shot at
a site, so be kind. It's not quite the glamor site that Thom or Everett
have, but it gets the message across. And in the spirit of NQ, I'll be
posting more updates on it's progress to the list.

Thanks,

Doug Heitkamp
