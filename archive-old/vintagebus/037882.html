Well...  I took my 64 sundial on the first road trip.(a whopping 60 miles)
Here are some observations Ive noticed from driving my 72 Westy.   

1.  I look a hell of alot cooler!!
2.  My Bay Window friends in the caravan enjoyed passing me alot.  I drove a
consistent 57-58mph while they          seemed to enjoy showing off how fast
i cant go.  
3.  My Bay Window friends are also telling me i need to go join the local
split window club now.(Jealousy Strikes!!)  Considering I have the only
split window on the road for 100 miles in any direction this might prove
difficult.  Of course, member turnout for club drives would have a 100%
attendence, not to mention they would never conflict with my schedule.
5.  Instead of getting the usual hippie bus routine from strangers, i now
get the classic nod of approval from all the other gearheads out at the
motor shop. This thing just loves to attract a good conversation. :)
6.  I've never loved driving in a big circle as much as yesterday.
