&gt; When I first got my DC, it sat somewhat low and I checked the adjustment

&gt; &quot;clicks&quot; and was happy with it.

By &quot;clicks&quot; do you mean splines?  I so, one spline would be around nine
degrees, a heck of a jump!  Much finer adjustments can be made by moving
the bar one spline in one direction on one end and one spline in the other
direction at the other end.

&gt; I did come across a lowering web page once where they were messing with the
&gt; rear torsion bars.  I vaguely remember something about heating the bars or
&gt; something to allow them to droop more.  I also wonder if with age, these
&gt; bars develop a slight twist to them?

Bars do develop a &quot;set&quot; which is why you never switch sides with them, but
once they settle they tend to stay that way for a very long time.  Heating
springs for lowering is done with coil springs by hack &quot;customizers&quot;.
Since VWs have built-in adjustment splines, and you would have to pull
the bars out anyway to heat them, even the densest customizer would not
be likely to resort to heating VW springs.
