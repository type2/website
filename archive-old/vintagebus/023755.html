Subject: 2nd opinion needed (longish)

Well here's the story-
I found a '65 bus - it's in Oregon &amp; I'm in CA, though I've seen the bus
a couple of times over the past few years.
The owner is asking $7K and I need a second *non-emotional* (as good as
we can get in our 'splittie-list') opinion.
*It's a conversion camper- possibly an E-Z from what I can gather from
the recent postings of interior photos. It sure looks like one anyway
from what I can remember.

*It was sitting for 15 yrs untouched at a neighbors when the current
owner bought it (who's had it for 4yrs). It did some West Coast tours
(OR&gt;CA&gt;OR) but was mostly an around town bus in Eugene &amp; has been
garaged for the past year or so. 

*Since then a second stock rebuild (1st one done shoddily) and tranny
work have been done.

*It currently runs fine- no apparent issues. 

*New brake work done and some body work -  it was in a collision and had
rear corner panel welded in w/ salvaged VW part. 

*Rust is evident on side doors- they will have to have some cut/paste
work done to remedy an obvious growing concern on the bottom.

*I am pretty certain that the side door rockers (inner/outer) will need
to be replaced. However, I don't know about the rest.

*Door seals and some window seals need replacing.

*The speedometer needs fixing/replacing- something- it's not running.

*It was converted to 12v long ago. 

*Inside door paneling needs to be replaced on the driver &amp; passenger
doors. 

*It was repainted about 5yrs ago-good basic job, stock colours.

*The interior is original (except for linoleum in main compartment I
think). 

*It includes the original tent/awning and radio.

I only have reservations because the asking price is higher than I
expected and I haven't seen a lot of campers to know what they are going
for. 

I bought my '67 Walkthru Deluxe which was a basic home-custom job on the
inside (minus center bench &amp; plus a Z-bed)with all new paneling, carpet,
paint. But a *very* well done mechanical restoration (stock). It had
it's original rag-top and jail-bars. The deluxe trim was missing as were
the overriders (bumper) &amp; a so-so paint job. It has it's rust issues(2
missing outriggers and a poorly replaced dog-leg, missing interior side
door rocker, an essentially 1/2 missing belly pan &amp; somewhat patched
battery shelf). I feel I paid a fair price ($3.5K), though some may say
differently- go ahead let me know , we only learn from mistakes anyway
:)

But the camper has me flummoxed.
The mechanical issues shouldn't be a concern for a while. 
I think the value will be mainly in it's interior with the caveat of how
bad that rear collision was, I suppose.

Anyone who is familiar w/ campers willing to take a look at it for me?
(Anyone willing to give personal references for that person?) ;) I know
that this may be a *desirable* bus. 
It'll be in Roseburg after the 15th. Any suggestions/ ideas appreciated.
E-mail me &amp; thanks.

p.s. maybe I'm just trying to make sure that I can justify the breeding
epidemic of busses  
-sorry Gerald! I just might need all that extra space in my yard! ;)
