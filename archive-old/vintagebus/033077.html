Thanks to the transmission gurus who offered advice. Without any type of
pullers, I was able to remove the RD boxes, circlip and necessary bearings
then figure out how to use the 2 arm puller to get the axle tube retainers
off. One of the inner bearings in one of the RD boxes looked like it was
missing a few balls, and there was a chunk of metal jammed in there, stuck to
the bearing. It was the bearing on top where the axle comes into the box.
Anyway, the axles have a red band on them. I ordered and purchased the
suggested internal circlip pliers, which allowed me to get both axle circlips
out in five minutes with minimal hassle. Thank you. Not too confidently I was
able to insert with a little force a .013 blade in there where the clearance
is to be checked, which probably indicates I'm past the tolerence. One
axle/fulcrum/side gear slid right out in one piece. The other side, (which
happened to have the bad bearing in the RD box) the axle came out on it's own,
The plates I fished out one at a time and found them to be discolored and one
of the corners pretty chipped. The side gear is stubbornly not coming out. I
did fish some metal material out of the side gear area with a magnet, and have
tried tapping the gear from the opposite axle hole, but it appears some
greater force must be applied. I'll let you know how it turns out. Thanks
again.
