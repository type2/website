&gt; Funny you should ask: Here's a '66 in (I think) DoQuoin (?) Illinois I live
&gt; in Dixon and Emailed the guy but I don't know when I could get there to look
&gt; at it, his email is: ghiaman_at_hotmail_dot_com, there's also another 66 in Ames
&gt; Iowa tel is: 515 771 6725.

&gt; &gt;     I have been on the search for a 65 - 67 Westfalia PopTop camper for
&gt; &gt; about 6 months now.  If anyone on the list knows were one is, or has one
&gt; &gt; for sale, I would be interested.  I live in Indiana  and would be
&gt; &gt; interested within about a 2 state radius.  I am not looking for a show
&gt; &gt; winner. A  driver that needs some work is my ideal  find.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would appreciate any leads.

I just got a '71 Camper and I really don't know much about them. I am a
19 year old student at UC Santa Cruz and I want to know if anyone knows
someone in the area who I could trust that knows a thing or two about
these beautiful machines.  It's in good shape now but I'd like to get
some body work done in the near future.
