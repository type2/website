Subject: Re: [VB] Panel or not, that is the question?

The doors are made solid and stamped in the area where windows would
be stamped out. So any window holes made in panel doors would be cut
out later, often by camper conversion outfits, as in the case of my 62
panel.

&gt; I just got a 63 panel or so I think it is. The bus has cut outs along the
sides where it looks like there used to be windows. Did the VW factory weld up
and then put body filler over where there were cut outs for windows. The left
side of the bus has cargo doors and the cut outs are filled and so is the cut
out just to the rear of the cargo doors. On the right side the cargo doors,
yes it has cargo doors on both sides, both have had the window cut outs filled
but on the right there was no cut out for a window behind the cargo doors.
This bus does have the divider with the window behind the cab. On the M plate
just below the gas tank the VIN# 1071349. Any clues as to the real identity of
this bus.
