The guy I bought my 65 westy from was really into VWs.  Also into Harleys.  
Even one at his place wore something  that said Harley Davidson on it, 
including the dogs.   The long white hair and beard leather and patched denim 
wearing bikers.  

Bay window middle seats are good for carport furnature.  I have heard they 
are worth $75, but I think I sold one for $35.  Also good as a seat in the 
garage, so your friends have a comfy place to sit and hand your beer.   Or 
the chihuahua sits there, as he finds that the heater blows warmth at the 
comfy seat.  
.............................

 My old beat up '67 westy always gets compliments at the biker saloon
where I hang out.  We have several customers at the VW shop where I work
who own and operate both a bus and a Harley. And, of course, there are
the trike folks who belong in both camps.

The biker community has a &quot;brotherhood&quot; very similar to the bus
community, except older and considerably more established. Political
views tend to be slanted different ways between the two camps (I think),
and I don't really want to get that thread started, but both seem to
share libertarian views, and both take care of their own.

Just musing out loud... How much is a good middle seat from a '73 worth?
