Ronnie,

I'm alittle late with my reply, but I have that exact one, and it is great.  I
hook up my shopvac to the exhaust hole and the think kicks ass.  Go ahead and ask
me any questions or concerns you might have.  You do need a pretty good sized
aircompressor for sand blasting.  In my opinion, I could only be happier if it
was a larger box.  For that price, I think it is a great deal, but you need a
shop vac to remove the dust Wade talked about.

&gt; I saw an ad with harbor freights $129 sand blaster on sale for $89 and was
&gt; wondering if any one on the list(s) had used them and what they thought about
&gt; them. haven't had much luck in the past with HF air tools in the past.
&gt; thanks
