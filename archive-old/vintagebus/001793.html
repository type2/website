Subject: Undercoating Removal
Date: Sat, 5 Aug 2000 16:20:11 -0500

It just gets better and better.  My current method for removing this stuff
kicks as*.  What I do is heat a small area with propane torch and scrap the
bulk off.  I really only apply heat for a very brief time.   I now have this
bottle that I picked up at a gardening store,  I fill it with gasoline and
pump the handle down which pressurizes the contents.  I spray the area that
I scrapped with the pressurized gas and with paint scrapper and steel wool I
get all of the remaining goo off - works like a charm.  I keep a hose
running under my bus to wash the gas away.  And I keep my fire extinguisher
close by.  Then I degrease the area by changing the contents of the bottle
from gas to simple green.  Then I spray with silicon wash, and then with
metal conditioner  and I hose the whole area off and finally I apply por-15.
I did the whole section between my wheel wells and between the inner rocker
and  the beam that the I-beams sit on. It only took me about 2 hours to
remove all of the undercoating.

As I mentioned before this old undercoating did an excellent job of
protecting my bus - in fact, this undercoating is probably why my bus is
still around after 40 Canadian years.  But where moisture became trapped
between the undercoating and the floor the result is some very weak spots.

I realize that por-15'ing my entire engine bay is a bit extreme - oh well, I
did it anyway.  I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to apply por-15 to
those upper areas of the engine bay that are visible through the air vents.
There was quite a bit of surface rust in there and I wanted to get it.  So
what I did was dip a paper towel in a cup of por-15 and reach up in there
and smear all of the surface with the por-15.  I'm quite sure I got it all
but since I can't see 100% up there I may have missed a little but I did
spend extra effort on the seams up there.
