Subject: Re: [VB] oversized pulley (was porsche pulley)

&gt; &gt; I bought the oversized pully that was advertised in VW Trends.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; Interesting info!  Could you supply us with the ratio your pulleys now are at
&gt; with the larger lower one, what belt size you are using, and perhaps how many
&gt; shims between in the upper pulley with the belt new?
&gt; Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb

Wjile were still on the subject. Clara mentioned something about her 6v
gen pulley.
is this right?
042 903 109A       6v
043 903 109       12v

is the diameter of the 6v pulley different?
measurements anyone?
