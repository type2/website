Hi all,

For lack of a better word, I have noticed that a lot of VW engines in good
running order have a kind &quot; chirping &quot; sound to them.  Does anyone know what
could be responsible for that good sound disappearing?  I recently adjusted
the carb (28PICT-2) mixture as it seemed to run rich (black smoke-ocassional
backfire) and adjusted valves (1500 cc - .006?) set timing, changed plugs and
now the engine sounds entirely different.  Runs a liitle stronger, but sounds
worse. 

Thanks,

Jeff 1964 Sundial-Diving into trans replacement next week-wish me luck
