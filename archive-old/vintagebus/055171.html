Ronnie,  sounds about what I did... I tried to match the paint but it came
out to match a Toyota 'Mouse Gray' color...egad, I could have never done
that... so I opted for a standard primer color... let 'em bitch I say!

   Well it's done, I finally got my 60 double cab painted. Well sort of.
After 80 hours of work we got the whole underneath painted.  Now I only have
the interior and the body to do and it's done, oh ya, I forgot putting it
back together.
   After numerous attempts to have the original chassis color matched I gave
up. There are at least 3 different colors on the chassis of the DC. These
are all original. The heater tubes are a different color then the rest of
the chassis and then you have the over spray from the original GRU paint,
ahhhggg. So what I came up with, actually a painter friend of mine was some
INDUSTRIAL gray paint, you know the kind they paint machinery with, we
lightened it and added some flattener agent to it and it came out good. It
took a gallon of paint to just paint the underside of the bus. This paint
goes on thick and dries hard as a rock, cure time 2 to 3 days. The next step
will be to paint the front beam (I'm putting a 67 with the big brakes and
sway bar on it) and to paint the trans and axles to match (big nut RGB's
with a 412/82 4th trans (my 3.88 is going in the 15 window with small nut
RGB's), so the work goes on. My plans are to have it DONE by BBB VI, I'll
have my whole 60's line-up there, DD panel, WESTY, 15 window and the DC all
60's.
   I prepped the underside by wire wheeling first, then wiping the whole
underside with lacquer thinner, treated the surface rust with RUST MORT then
painted it.

   Ronnie
