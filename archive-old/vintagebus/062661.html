Subject: Re: Westfalia Interior 66 year model.

check out my site... it is FULL of pictures and descriptions for the camper 
interiors that were available in the Split years.

&gt;What could I expect to see in a 66 Westy with walk through seats?
&gt;Need pics if you can send or direct me to decent interior shots.
&gt;Possibly this vehicle may been a Weekender or some thing else but still
&gt;carried the Westfalia placard.
