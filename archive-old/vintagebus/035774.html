&lt;&lt; Did you try switching from high to low beam?  
 Did you check the fuses?  
 Did someone steal your headlights?

 &gt; I drove my '66 (6 volt) Westy to the store last night, after dark,

 &gt; lights, turn signals, dash lights etc.. but no headlights...they worked
 &gt; on the way over...what gives? Any ideas?
  &gt;&gt;
funny thing is that For a while the headlights on my 65 westy would fail on 
low beam sometimes.   I thought it was the headlight switch, so replaced it, 
but that was no diff.   They would come on on high beam.   After a while it 
fixed itself, I think the high beam swith on the floor got corrosion, but its 
better now I use that switch more.  In fact, the lights haven't spontaniously 
gone off for months.   (knock on wood)

so what I am saying, is it is likely corrosion is a factor.  Get out yer 
sandpaper and clean up connections and grounds.
