Very dirty carb(maybe one of the openings is getting stuck)? &lt;&lt;

Hi Kevin,
We have seen where an fuel pump not greased throughly inside can stick 
occasionally as it rusts up inside.  Carb can be a big problem and need multiple 
cleanings to rid it of a problem.  Could also be a piece of something floating in 
the gas tank and no screen sock over the outlet tube, causing occasional 
partial or complete blockage.
