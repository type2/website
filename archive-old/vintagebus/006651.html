Put one on Thom, get HP to back it, but heck VW Howard and I drive 1000's of
miles a year to shows, heck he's in Prescott now 400 miles RT and a couple
of weeks ago in Carlsbad, 500 rt, then we'll do the Classic weekend 1000
plus mile weekend, I would have been in Prescott but my BD is supposed to
show up this weekend&gt; Then after these shows I'll do Colorado, 1500 miles
rt, so you see we all travel to be at these shows, and these are just for
the weekend.

ronnie &quot;on the road&quot;  24,000 since the Classic last year (give or take
speedo error)

Why can't we have something like this in NorCal?  Why must everything be in
SoCal?

There's nothing significant in the Sacramento area.  Sure, there's the
rama, but it's pretty much overrun by the slamed/primer crowd.

We need a *vintage* meet.  No A-chassis.  No drag racing.  Like a Kelly
Park, but closer.
