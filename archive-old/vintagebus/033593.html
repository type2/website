Subject: RE: [VB] Determining gear ratio

I wondered where that chart was. Stephen (the guy who did my catalog)
developed the chart while staying at my house in Havasu. We were trying to
figure out the gear ratio's in his Westy before we did the swap to the 3.44
r/p trans that is in it now.

&gt; I think that is how you do it, except I though it
&gt; was-- singular- jack stand 
&gt; so only ONE wheel will turn, and you count the one
&gt; that does.  Leave one 
&gt; wheel on the ground.  anyone have that website URL
&gt; to figure the ratio?

http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/tech/Trans/

That's one URL for the online ratio finder.
