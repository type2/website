Subject: Who knows about &quot;Kustom Kamper&quot;

I have a '61 panelvan camper conversion, which I have finally identified as
being a &quot;Kustom Kamper&quot;.  Does anyone know anything at all about this
company.  Where they were located?  Do they still exist?  Does anyone have
any literature?  Any other &quot;Kustom Kampers&quot; out there?
Any info at all would be greatly appreciated.

My bus can be seen at this link:

Thanks.  Don...
