Any thoughts as to other causes of poor mileage?
Hi Rocco,
Check your cruising RPM!  We used to drive at 3,800 RPM at 55 MPH and thought 
we could hear that we were doing only 3,000 RPM, as we can without any 
problem in the bugs, and KGs.  When we found out what RPM we were doing when we 
temporarly installed a tach we slowed down to 3,000 RPM at 47 MPH our MPG went 
from 18-19 to 27 with the big bore 40HP engine!  Engine lifespan doubled from 
30-40,000 to 80,000+.
  Now running a 1641 SP with 3.875 R&amp;P Free Flier tranny doing 3,000 RPM at 
58MPH and getting 23 MPG.
  Also we would check the carb jetting.
Eric&amp;Barb
PS If anyone want us to send the info we have put together on our tranny 
gearing experience just Pmail us and we will send you this info.
