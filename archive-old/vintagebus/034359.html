Subject: RE: [VB] belly pans and rust prevention
Date: Thu, 13 Jan 2000 08:27:40 +1100

mmmmm,

Absolutely - I've seen pristine grey paint in there
and all sorts of horrors.  In my particular case,
water had obviously sitting in there for a while,
probably while the bus was parked for a long time
at some stage in its life.  The old
pans weren't rusted through but had some pitting
and lotsa pinholes (as they say 'while you're
 in there.........')

On the subject of extra strength, I don't believe the
pans would give you anything extra over 'boxing in'
the longitudinal chassis rails with some 2mm plate.
(all double door and sunroof models also came with
the third 'rear' outrigger...)

If I had a double door or sunroof model and I couldn't make
reasonably faithful pans (I'm personally not a fan of the current crop of
repops) I
would box the chassis for strength and add the pans later when/if 
something better came along in terms of repro pieces.
If boxing in the chassis you'd probably have to also run a tube
for the wiring harness to aid future possible replacement.

	&gt;Yes and no.  I've seen it both ways.  There are drains - if they
get
	&gt;clogged,  then stuff will build up in there.  Otherwise they shield
the
	&gt;bottom of the bus.  I imagine the heat works slightly better, as
the tube
	&gt;is protected.

	&gt;&gt;roof.  Do the belly pans help to prevent frame, and cargo floor
rust by 
	&gt;&gt;shielding the frame from the elements, or do they just create more
grief 
	&gt;&gt;(corrosion-wise) by keeping any water that gets between the plates
and the 
	&gt;&gt;frame stagnant?  Thoughts and experiences from deluxe owners out
there?
