&lt;&lt; Hey Dan!  How about reproing westy trailer hitches? &gt;&gt;

I made a prototype when I bought my Puck last summer.  It was okay but not as 
great as I would like it to be.  Some listeez may have seen it at Busses by 
the Arch.  Have the much improved second generation done and in the garage 
waiting for this camping season to try out.

But Ronnie is right, liability is a huge issue.  Have to look into that 
before offering to reproduce.

If there are any Midwest listeez in need of a hitch I now have three or 
four...got another one this weekend.  Various would be the best way to 
describe them.  I really do not want to mess with shipping them.  I'll offer 
them to any listee if they can arrange pickup.  I am just off I-70 east of 
Kansas City so maybe there will be a listee going through town to help 
transport?

Thanks,
Dan
