Subject: Plub plub plub plat!  Exhaust leak

Hullo, list.

The rusty old non-stock exhaust on my camper's dp engine seems to be
giving up the ghost.  It makes noise (not deafening but DEFINITELY
there) during acceleration though is as &quot;quiet&quot; as usual while idling or
cruising.  Obviously it needs replacing, but will driving it as-is
damage my engine?  I am not a hotrodder and am happy trundling about
town with my H30/31 PICT getting 20 mpg.  I've heard things about
&quot;floating valves&quot; if there is insufficient back-pressure.

I may be getting down-sized next week so I am hoping to avoid/delay some
expenses, if prudent.  Usually I jump on these kinds of things.  I do
have another vehicle option if necessary but it's not the same...

TIA, all.
