 I need to get the lists collective
advice/experience/wisdom on what Ive got going here.
 Background...1600cc DP, 40,000 miles, 009 dizzy(no
flaming please, vac went south), Crane cams electronic
ignition, stock duel tip exhaust, oil bath air
cleaner, and a bran stinkin new 34-pic-3 carb(hecho en
mexico).
 The engine runs great cruzin down the road, but after
you kill it &amp; let it set a few, itll bust right over &amp;
spit &amp; sputter at ya for 30 seconds or so, then catch
to a regular idle. Now were not touchin the gas on
restart, ifin ya do, ya gotta crank on it for a few
secs to get it to hit. Choke is adjusted properly, as
is the carb.
Now the question, should a person rejet a bran new
carb to compensate for the milage on the engine? Like
I said it runs good, its just annoying when it does
its little sputtering. Im not 100% percent sure the
carb is the culpret, but it didnt do this with the old
carb on it.
Thanks in advance....
