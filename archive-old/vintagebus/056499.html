Subject: [VB] Broken exhaust studs


&gt;While assembling the engine for my '65 single cab I managed to break two of
&gt;the rear exhaust studs, one on each head
&gt;My question
&gt;is to those with experience using time-serts to repair stripped threads.
&gt;Did you do the repair with the part in place (using an electric hand drill)
&gt;or remove the part and drill it out in a drill press?  I'm not really in a
&gt;position to remove the heads right now.  Any tips for a successful repair?
&gt;Should I use locktight on the insert?

Consider yourself fortunate that the broken studs removed easily.
As long as you have hand drill access to the repair and are
accurate with it, there is every possibility of a successful repair.
Do not over-drill. Once the hole is made, immediately remove the drill.
My personal preference is to stop the tap short of the necessary full thread,
and let the  insert cut/swedge the final thread for a tight clamp.
If you are using a taper tap, the final thread is there, just not cut full depth.
i also use threadlocker liquids. Others may not, i don't care.
In future repairs, you might consider using heat to remove any exhaust nut
which you aren't personally acquainted with. Never had a stud break with heat.
