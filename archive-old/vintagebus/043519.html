&gt;Subject: [VB] stepped stud and weber carbs
&gt;
&gt;First off...I need a stepped stud for converting an earlier engine to a
&gt;doghouse oil cooler... i think its 6mm/8mm?  Would someone have one of
&gt;these?  I need one and am having trouble finding one...

My Dad and I had to put a stepped stud on one of the oil plate studs
on his Bug, as the original was stripped out.  After we bought one
at the local VW aftermarket place, we found the exact same stud at
the local True Value hardware store.  It was in the section with
all the lidded plastic boxes that slide out so you can open them,
in a &quot;metric studs&quot; box.

[from a later message]
&gt;I just picked up an EMPI cylinder head temp gauge (60-140 degrees
&gt;celsius range) and all I got was the gauge with a thick wire coming out
&gt;of the back...and the light bulb in the gauge.

Does the thick wire have any insulation on it?  If not, that may be
the sending unit.  It may be a mechanical gauge as opposed to an
electric one.  The expansion of fluid (sometimes air) inside that
thick &quot;wire&quot; moves the pointer.  This is especially true if the wire
fattens out into a bulb at the far end.  If the wire is not insulated
and there is no bulb on the end, you have to look at the end to see
if it is crimped shut or just lopped off with some cutters - if it
looks just lopped off, then the gauge may not work anymore.

If the wire is insulated, don't try this.  But if it's just a bare
wire, possibly with a fat bulb on the end, microwave some water
to boiling in a disposable cup, and stick the &quot;wire&quot; in the water.
If the gauge moves up to 100 C or so, then that's it.  The reason
to use a disposable cup is in case the &quot;wire&quot; has oil or junk on it
that you don't want in your good pans.

In case you're curious, a similar temperature sensor is often used
in refrigerators and ovens.  Look around the ceiling of your oven
and you'll probably find a similar &quot;wire&quot; that comes from the
thermostat on the front panel.  You may find one in the fresh food
compartment of your refrigerator too.
