How much do you have to adjust it?  I've had pretty good success by judicious
whacks with a mallet in the appropriate directions.

&gt; Has anyone had to adjust the door gaps on a Bus?  On the Panel I've got the

&gt; the door back slightly?  I remember from my Body Work days we use to shim
&gt; the doors when they didn't have an adjustment there.  These door don't seem
&gt; to lend them self to shimming or adjusting much.
