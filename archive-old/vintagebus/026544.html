&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; Someone in this thread mentioned a different way of setting the valves
&gt; which involved less turning of the engine.  Has anyone tried this
&gt; method and then checked the results using the &quot;traditional&quot; method?  I
&gt; wonder if the base circle of the cam is really that round?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

That was me.........I've been doing my valves this way for well over 10
years, A local &quot;old timer&quot; VW mechanic showed me the routine the first time I
asked him how to set the valves. It's easy to remember and has never let me
down............
