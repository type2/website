Expert? I'll leave that title for Todd S..
Well, lots of transition racks, so I can only vouch for those I have seen, 

Early barndoor one, full length, tent brackets built in.
Early rack like on my 56, 15 slats, 53&quot; long, solid enclosed tubes.
Rack like that green/green 58, 53&quot; long, 15 slats square tubes, just like my 
56 one except the bottoms are open to the public.
59ish style, 15 slats but the later style bows. single rack tag. (Kris 
Heinicka claims this beast exists)
59-61 style, sloped, 13 slats. dual rack tag, 53&quot;
62-64 style, dual tags, 53&quot;, but flat.
65-67 poptop style, 48&quot;? 13 slats, two tags.
I'm sure there are more, , , ,

From discussions with him, I'm under the impression that there is
yet another *earlier* style as well.  Had a 59-63 on my '55, and
it did not fit correctly with the pre-59 tent.  

Hey Greg - can you upload some more rack pix to the gallery?&gt;&gt;
