Subject: Carb Question

I have spent the past few days trying to devour the
Solex Selection and Tuning guide found at
vintagebus_dot_com.  Pg 21 says that the Air correction
jet should be approximately = Main Jet + 60. I have 6
carbs that I keep either in use of clean and ready to
go.  (4 H30/31's and 2 30/Pict-1's).  3 of these were
bought brand new and I dont believe any have been
re-jetted.  Yet on the H30/31's I have a main of 120
and an air correction of 120.  On the 30/Pict-1 I have
mains of 0110 and air correction of 135.  No place to
I have a difference of 60 between main and air
correction.
What gives?  Is the book off base or are the carbs
coming new incorrectly?
It may help to know my goal is to up the main in the
H30/31's to 127 to try to achieve a little lower rpm's
and temps.  When I leave the air correction at 120 it
doesnt like to idle smoothly.  Following the manual I
would need about a 165-170 air correction. Following
the manufacturer I would need a 125-130 air
correction.

Thanks
