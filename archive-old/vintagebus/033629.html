Subject: RE: [VB] RE truck drivers

   Courtesy to the trucks goes both ways. I listen to the truckers on the CB
and haven't heard a bad thing about me. My favorite one is &quot; Did you see
that dang hippy bus blow past me at over 80 mph&quot; or &quot; watch out ahead
there's one of them V-Dub buses going up the hill at 20 mph&quot;. When I drive
the highways I always try to work with the truckers. On my last trip to
Cali. I got on the CB and asked a trucker if he would mind if I tailed him
to help block a head wind and he said no problem so I hugged his A#s
(trailer) and let him pull me along for 40 miles or so. Be nice to truckers
and they'll be nice to you.

I have been a truck driver for more than 30 years ( yeah, I'm gettin' old ).
I can speak for lots of us when I say &quot; It ain't the bus that pisses us off,
its the driver&quot; If you get out there and exercise your right to slow down a
loaded truck at the beginning of a long hill, he's gonna crowd you.
Use your mirrors, know what's happening behind as well as in front of you.
Learn how to flash your lights to let him know when he can pull back in
ahead of you. That's not only a safety item ( yes it's legal, not like a 'do
pass' signal ) it's also a courtesy.
Just remember, it works both ways.
