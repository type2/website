Subject: RE: [VB] rack questions

Those late model racks you speak of also fit Vanagons,
not that I own either, but have seen it in real life.

&gt; Kevin makes a really good point. I recall the center
&gt; front to back 
&gt; support rail on clearing the roof by and inch or
&gt; two.  Because the 
&gt; VWoA rack I had was common the bays and splits and
&gt; the legs are at a 
&gt; slight outward angle it stands to reason that
&gt; instead of redesigning 
&gt; the entire rack they simply made the legs shorter to
&gt; accommodate the 
&gt; narrower rain gutter and flatter roof on the 68 to
&gt; 79 model buses.
