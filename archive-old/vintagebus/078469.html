Subject: my new seat  

67 Riviera.. 

Came to me with tall non stock seats.  Finally took the non stock drivers 
seat out of it and put a real splitty drivers seat in it... so much nicer.  Not 
only is the seat firmly attached to the bus instead of shifting around, but the 
other seat was too tall so I had to hunch or I'd be looking at the sunvisor 
not through the windsheild.   Now it's the right height,  no hunching.    don't 
have to lean halfway over to shift gears anymore either.
