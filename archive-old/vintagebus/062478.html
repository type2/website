Subject: Re: [VB] Do I need a main seal?

--part1_9c.2561ae3f.2aa4fb29_boundary

If you have the engine out and see oil in the bell housing (engine oil not 
gear oil as you can smell the difference) you ought to replace the main seal 
and O ring.  If I were you I'd pull the fan shroud and replace the oil cooler 
seals as well.  Grease the main seal lightly around the face whre it goes 
into thecase to make it go in better.  The O ring is in the FW around where 
it meets the crank- use a small screwdriver to pry it out and wipe the FW 
with a rag and oil the O ring lightly when installing.  Early FWs don't take 
an Oring- they have a step where the meet the FW.

Simple green works well to clean up the bell housingand the case under the 
FW.  Make sure the FW is clean and ungrooved where the clutch presses it.  
That your clutch is dry and has lots of wear left- if it wears down to the 
rivets it'll groove the FW.

&gt; Probably a dumb question. But when I pulled the engine
&gt; from my bus, there was oil in the bottom of the bell
&gt; housing of the tranny. Not all the way around the
&gt; housing, just around the bottom.
&gt; Time for a new main seal? The engine had been leaking
&gt; slightly, I thought from back there (back is front)
&gt; but there was so much grime on the engine, I'm not
&gt; sure really where the oil is coming from (usually the
&gt; case, eh?) engine pun not intended.

&gt; BONUS QUESTION:  Ever notice the tranny gear oil and
&gt; engine oil smell distinctly different?
&gt; 
&gt; Mine do, anyway.
