How much power does that &quot;low-voltage&quot; relay pull?  Some pull as much
if not more than the stock solenoid.

How solid/clean are the contacts everywhere along the line?  I'm talking
battery, solenoid, wire to the key switch up front, wire from the key
switch up front, connections to the fuse box, etc.

What weight oil do you have in it?  What's the temperature around the
bus been for the several hours before the starting attempts?

This really sounds like a classic case of multiple dirty contacts,
perhaps combined with too heavy an oil for the prevailing temperature.
