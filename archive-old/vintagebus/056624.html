Subject: Re: [VB] spraying water into carb???

Hi Poor Richard,
The water probably will not do the trick.  Most likely the rings are stuck 
due to corrosion between the aluminum piston and cast iron rings.  The only 
way to clean this out is to remove the heads and cylinders and clean by hand 
each ring groove!
