Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn
