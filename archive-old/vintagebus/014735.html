Over the past couple of days, I replaced the lower nose section on the
'60 DD panel.  It wasn't too difficult, even for someone with my limited
body and paint skills.  I used a nose piece I got from VWHoward, the lower
outer came from Ronnie, and the inner support came from Wolfsburg West.

I cut the old nose 2cm below the headlight buckets.  Anyone need a nice
upper nose, with headlight buckets and nipples?

I was looking over it before I left for work this morning, and I think it
came out OK.  Ironically, it was this bit that had stymied me when
working on the '54.  When I did the '54, I was trying to use the zillion
itty bitty pieces that Alan Shofeld sells - without instructions.
Having the one-piece inner section made a BIG difference, although I think
the stamping of Alan's stuff is much better.  I just couldn't figger
out how to use Alan's pieces!

I took detailed pix along the way, and I'm thinking of writing up the
procedure.
