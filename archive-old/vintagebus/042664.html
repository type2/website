hehe,

Im just the opposite, i consider a lot of what PO's may have done to be a
part of the history of the bus and their modifications should be preserved
when i like em, if i dont like em i fix it.  I would like a nice sunshine
face, i didnt like the roller pedal in my 61.

In europe i have heard the museums keep vehicles as they found them rather
than restoring to factory specs more often than not.

take care,

Steve
