Hey there-
I scored a perfect 12 volt bus gauge at the Forrest VW show last June in 
Villa Park, IL for 1$
I'm always keeping my eyes open for the dollar boxes.
At this same show I got front and rear deluxe bumper trim for 5$, rearview 
bus mirror for 1$,and a  Chrome ashtray for 1$. 

My buddy also walked away w/ rustfree front doors and rear hatch for a '66 
for 40$ total. The show was ending, it started pouring down rain and the 
swapper just wanted to go home:)

Gotta love those kind of days!
