hey everyone,
i am looking into buying a so42 campbox. it is totally complete and comes
with two extra closets and and extra table with a leaf. it is a
non-walkthrough kind with an icebox/water tank/water pump. no sink. the
cushion covers are in great shape (they do have one small rip in the rear
seat back). the guy wants $400 for it. is this a fair price? do you think it
is too high? very low? normal?

sounds like a decent price for a  fair body w/no motor .    Seems reasonable 
if the body isn't toast .  It it is a decent driver you got a deal.  DO look 
at othe things than the camping kit when buying the box though.
