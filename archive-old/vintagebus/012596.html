Hi! I've got a problem with my transmission, and I hope I can get an
answer from the experts on the list.

My '65 Deluxe has a hard time shifting into third. If I try to shift into
third from second, I have to push the shifter all the way to the right,
then just a little bit more. You can feel resistance, then it will pop a
little bit further, almost as if it were passing some sort of detent.

On the other hand, if I shift from second into fourth, then into third,
without releasing the clutch, it slides right into gear with no proble.
However, it then seems more likely to pop out of gear when I do get to
fourth gear.

If I go from second to third and then to fourth, it doesn't seem to pop
out of gear.

I'm stumped, baffled, puzzled, disconcerted, and more than a little
stupid! Any help would be greatly appreciated!
