Hi all,
*Brrrrrrr*. Try replacing your entire accelerator cable assembly outside in
17 degree weather sometime.
 
Boy, the accelerator cable in the panel was a mess. (remember it was mostly
bailing wire)
First get the snow off the shop driveway. It's power snow so that goes easy.
Time for some fun. As I started pulling the cable out of the bus I noticed
the pedal assembly was all buggered up. So I took that off too. The &quot;L&quot;
shaped accuating arm was twisted in two directions and there wasn't a cotter
pin holding it on. Flattened the arm out with the vice and a hammer then
went back out into the cold to put it back in. Doesn't it seem these arms
are always screwed up in some way or another? I added a few extra wide
washers here and there to take out the side to side sloppiness in the
accuating arm and the pedal rod. I may take the rod off when it gets warmer
and permanently weld a washer to where the bottom &quot;L&quot; bend is to stop the
accuating arm from creeping up the rod, and getting all sideways. This was
happening to my accuation arm causing the pedal to stick. The extra washer
on the accuation arm pivot should help get rid of a lot of the sloppiness
too.
 
Now on to pushing the &quot;good&quot; used cable through the tube. *push, push, push*
then stop. What the... It's only in about 12&quot; inches! Hmmm... what can it be
getting stuck on. The old one pulled out fine. I look right behind the front
beam and notice the accelerator cable tube has too much of a bend in it.
Pull down on the tube, it bends real easy, and make it as straight as I can.
Ok, go back to pushing the cable in. It slides perfectly now.
 
Now it's time to jack up the rear of the bus to push the cable through the
fan shroud tube. Hey where's the cable. I pushed all the way through but I
don't see it. But wait, what's this extra fuel line for? Doh!!  A PO put SAE
fuel line between the chassis and the front engine tin to protect the cable.
Great idea if the end that holds onto the fan shroud tube didn't fall off.
I'm really cold and I really don't want to screw around with trying to
fiddle it in place. Back to the front of the bus. Pull the cable half way
out. Now back to the rear and cut the rubber hose in half. *snick* problem
fixed and in the trash. So, now back to pushing the cable back through.
*Arghhhh* where is the feeling in my fingers. Oh great the fanshroud tube
doesn't have a hose clamp on it so it moves around. Just about this time my
friend Zach comes out to see how I'm doing, after working in the nice warm
shop. Cool, I have two extra hands. He holds the tube and I push the cable
through. *Ahhhhhh* all done!!!  hook the carb up, DONE!!!  Now go into the
shop and warm up.
 
Wait a minute, about now you're thinking, Why didn't you do this inside the
shop?  Simple reason, it was full of 911 bits, cause Zach was putting his
Porsche back together so he could get to work on Monday. Plus, I get a kick
out of self punishment. NOT! 
 
*Vroom!*, pedal feels good and I have free movement all the way to the
floor. It doesn't stick anymore. Happy, happy, joy, joy! Bus goes full
throttle now, me like!!
 
Snow is good, snow is great!
How do we accelerate!
Fast, Fast, Fast!
Wheeeeee! :-)
Remember kids don't try this at home!
