Subject: RE: [VB] Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW event

&gt; It's interesting that while VW does not support vintage VWs, 
&gt; other car manufacturers do.  BMW , for example.   BMW dealers 
&gt; continue to carry parts for their vintage cars and 
&gt; motorcycles, and support events around them, as good PR for 
&gt; people with old BMWs to buy new BMWs.   Cause most people 
&gt; with old cars have new ones too.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people I know who are into old BMW motorcycles were 
&gt; surprised that there was so much aftermarket stuff available 
&gt; for the ACVWs, and nothing from VW.


Be careful what you wish for!  Some car manufacturers that have set up
their own Vintage parts programs (largely using aftermarket parts that
they &quot;approved&quot; for sale under their name, not original parts), and then
proceeded to crack down on aftermarket sales of the same parts -
effectively allowing them to largely monopolize the vintage parts
market. The net result was higher parts prices due to lack of
competition, but no significant improvement in quality or selection. (Of
course, this is different from companies that have supported their old
cars all along, and have produced new factory parts for old models on an
ongoing basis.)
