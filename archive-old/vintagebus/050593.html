Hi Matt,
Sounds like you have found a solid early Westie.  Would be nifty if you would 
share with us the codes from the Mcode plate behind or under the front seat 
on the passenger side.  Westies in that kind of condition are just getting 
harder to find and while the interior will probably be slow in finding it 
piece by piece it is much more findable than finding a good Westie body.
