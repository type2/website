Just wondering if anyone else is tired of all of the self-absorbed trip
reports and &quot;look what I found today&quot; postings.
&gt;
Hmm, I haven't noticed the stories being self-absorbed, I just read them
and try to figure out how they relate to me.  :)  Anyhoo, I like 'em!  You
get to hear about interesting places, repairs on the road, and more!

I also like to hear about people's Bus finds and progress on Buses.  Sure,
I don't want to see 50 notes about how &quot;Changed the oil in my Bus, got
some gas, the end&quot; but I think it keeps a lot of people motivated and
excited about their Buses.  I don't mind it if they're bragging about
their $300 find.  Although, I'm a lot more interested in seeing pics than
knowing how much it cost.  Keeps me scouting those back and side yards
when I'm driving around, too.

&gt;Seems that this list has the potential to be much more useful..
&gt;
Please elaborate.

Later,

            I could annoy listees with questions about it
