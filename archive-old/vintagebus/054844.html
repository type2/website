Subject: Tilt canvas maker open for bidness

SS upholstery has told me that shes ready to go. $700 for a single or double
cab canvas + s/h.  Half down until completion. SS canvas comes pre-shrunk
and pre-sprayed with water/mildew resister. Approx 2 week completion time. I
havent seen them-  Pictures of her canvases are on the way to me so I will
scan them and post em up. Ive been workin with her to make them as cheap as
possible but the problem came down to the loops and grommets being 3 bucks
each. I figured out that the VW 'thing' convertible top uses the same exact
loops and grommets, but im still trying to find a place that will sell them
for less then $3 in bulk. Dont mail me back saying PLF sells em, cause she
wants 3 bucks each too in bulk, and wont realease her source. The search
continues.
So anyway contact jillgoble_at_hotmail_dot_com  in WA for more info.
Ill prolly send her my PLF canvas to be adjusted and restitched since Ive
had so many problems with it. Its flat out stitched crooked, end of story.
