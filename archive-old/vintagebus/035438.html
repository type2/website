it is not only correct, but it makes it hard to read my accessory shift
pattern shift knob in my 58 hardtop deluxe.

&lt;&lt; After a four year restoration Patty and I got the 58 double door panel
on the road this past saturday. Everything went perfectly but I do have
one small question for you guys. My gear shift lever turns 360 degrees.
Is this correct? I checked the entire system and I did not see anyway
for it not to turn in a full circle. This condition prohibits me form
using any shift extender.
Thank you.
