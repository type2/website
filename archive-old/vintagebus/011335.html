North Carolina. All the details including maps and directions are available

areas are beginning to

My bus and I are from Garner, right beside Raleigh, NC.  Poor Richard and I are
going to try to carbabus and if anyone wants to join us, we'd love it.  I'm
looking forward to EveryBus; it should be great fun!   Come and debate
walk-throughs or benches if you want :)
