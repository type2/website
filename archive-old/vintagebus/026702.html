Subject: RE: Alert

I might want to warn the members of the list that the nature of some of
these messages are becoming borderline legal.  Some of these people who
are getting
slammed might have freinds that are lawyers.  And a chacracter suit
would kill a
bus habit very quickly.  Especially if the suit was across state lines,
it could become
very expensive.

If you are dealing with a crook, what makes anyone think that someone
like that
wouldn't sue to shut someone up.

Just my opinion.

Cecil
