I think I'll try playing around a little with it.  All the shifter bushings are
new and were installed properly, I never had to force the shift rod anywhere
and it was straight when I removed it to clean and grease it.  The tranny 
mounts are all new and are installed tightly.

Redux boxes were done by the rebuilder, and other than the freeze-plugz leaking
I'm happy with them -- fourth gear is the only gear that howls at all, and 
there's no push-pull slop in the stub axles.

The way that I adjusted the shifter was to put the tranny into first gear
from under the bus, and then hook the shifter stuff up in the front.  All the
gears seem to engage just fine from doing this.  I'm thinking that I should try
adjusting the shifter like this for second and third gear instead of first and
see how that makes it go.  If it still grinds in the morning in second or pops
out of third, I think it's safe to assume there's a problem with the tranny.

Fourth gear howl, although I don't like it, I can live with.

Oddly(?) second never grinds when downshifting that I recall, and third doesn't
pop out.
