  Hi Steve, I have a '61 Westy I'm restoring also.  The thickness across is 1-1/4&quot; 
all the way.  The thickness 'height' wise varies, starting dead center it is 1-5/8&quot;, 
6&quot; either direction away from center it is 1-9/16, at 12&quot; it's 1-3/8&quot;, at 18&quot; it's 1-1/8&quot;, 
at 24&quot; it's 15/16&quot; to the very end.
  I hope this helps and is not too confusing.
    Lou in Havasu 
P.S. BBB 5 is coming in January, start making plans!!!!!!!!!
