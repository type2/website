&gt; I remember it was a nice bus, wasn't it really solid?   I was surprised that

Hi Clara,
Really solid was an understatement.  We could only find surface rust in two 
places and a third place where a literal dime sized hole of rust had happened 
in the body at one of the pop-out window indent!  It even had a complete 
Eberspacher which we eventually got back, but without the electrical harness 
which was lost somewhere.  The SO-22 &amp; 33 was the ultimate Westie interior 
for ease of installation and removal at a moments notice.  Some of the VWoA 
literature even shows how this Westie camper interior could be installed for 
the weekend and removed for the workdays.  This interior appears to have been 
sold by dealers as a seperate accessory you could order for your non-Westie 
bus.  This way the loonnngggg wait for an official complete Westie could be 
avoided and one could be camping all the sooner.
