All,
    Tar is horrible to remove.  Don't put it behind anyplace that you
may want to refinish, bump out, really do anything to in the future.  I
hate to see tar used anywhere on a car that I'd want to keep and
protect.  It causes many more problems than it could possibly cure.
Build a balanced, low CR engine with a good stock muffler and the noise
level in your bus will almost be tolerable.  Not that my hearing is any
good any more...

    `P.S.  Too bad Bob Hoover is not around anymore to give us a sermon
on the use of pitch and tar on square rig ships!
