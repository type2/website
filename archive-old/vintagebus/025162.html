I realize that the problem I am having may be typical of 6V buses; I'm
hoping someone on the list can help me out. I've written about this
before, but still not tracked down the answer. When it's cold, my bus
starts right away, usually on the first crank. After the engine has been
running, it turns over so slowly that it takes several minutes for it to
cool down enough to crank fast enough for the engine to catch. Saturday
I installed the RMM hot start relay kit, but it has made no difference.
Here's what I've done so far: Replaced starter, and bushing, battery and
both cables, ignition switch, transmission ground strap.
I've even run a #10 test wire from the solenoid connection to the
ignition switch, but no change.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
