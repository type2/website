&lt;&lt; What size filter is used?  (I'm assuming it's a screw-on cartridge)&gt;&gt;
 Hi Fred,
On the filter/oil pump one can use all sorts of size filters if you are 
talking about outside filter diamentions as long as the filter and pump 
threading matches there are lots of outside dia. choices.  
  We are using VW Rabbit Mann filters (Sorry do not have the filter number 
here.), and WIX filter # 51516 on both the vintage and a modern filter/oil 
pump.  This filter/oil pump that we have tried on a friends bus and two years 
later is still working great.  Thank goodness!  When we first met her she had 
just bought her bus and we taught her how to work on it herself.  We would 
like to meet the three handed dwarf that rebuilt the engine in a dark alley 
and try out our batting practice on him!  When the engine oil was drained 
about a 1/4 cup of copper shavings were removed from the bottom of the engine 
sump.  So we figured that using a used no-name brand filter/oil pump we 
picked up at a swap meet on her bus was a good bet on her very limited budget 
to protect her bearing from futher crud.  The very next oil change her oil 
sump was totally clean of any metal shavings/dust and has been ever since.  
She has run both the header and stock 1600 muffler with it, with no 
interferance problems.  Plus she has oil pressure and temp gauges and has not 
noticed a difference in these before and after the installation.
There are some things we are not thrilled about this modern aftermarket pump. 
 The lower driven gear is not on an axle pressed into the forward pump body.  
Instead the axle is pressed into the gear and both ends sticking out of the 
gear ride in bores on either end.  The bores and axle should be longer to 
give more bearing surface, but since this gear is supported on both ends it 
should be hopefully adequet.  The gear end play is too much on one of the two 
we have here.  Though that can be remedied by a bit of wet-dry sand paper, a 
piece of wing window glass as a flat surface, and wet sanding the forward 
part of the filter/oil pump down a few thousands, or have a machine shop 
lathe the body shorter.  The oil passages in the rear part of the pump 
definitely could use blue printing to match them to the forward body passages 
better and enlarge them to the same or at least close to size as the outlet 
port of the filter/oil pump.
  We have not measured the two we still have for fit into the engine case.  
Could anyone measure a couple of stock pumps and provide us with a 
measurements in the thousands of an inch?
    A friend of our just gave us some VW magazines and one of them is a HVW 
of MAR99.  In this magazine this same modern pump is photo advertised on 
pages 114, 135, and 147.  Hopefully the quality of the machining has not 
gotten better not worse since the pumps we have were made.  At the very least 
we would advise that one should have a 6&quot; dial machinist caliper to check the 
pump when it arrives to make sure it is not junk.

   We would really like to look at one of these Mexican filter/oil pumps ASAP 
to make comparisons.

&lt;&lt;Could these pump/filter units be adapted for use on a later Type 2 with the 
rear engine mounting bar?  &gt;&gt;
Good question.  We would need to see that kind of set up and do some 
measuring.
