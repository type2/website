Subject: A Few Parts

I have a late model 1955 Kombi and need a front emblem.  Do you have one?
It is one of the last parts I need for a 12 year restoration project and it
would go on a great bus.

Also needed:

-Side Mirrors, the ones with the long stems. 
-The inner flap for the cool air intake under the roof.  Need the white
handle and the rod.  I have a 62 one in the car, however it is backwards,
really need a near 1955.

By the way:

I have a late model 1955 Bus that is Registered as a 1956.  It doesn't have
a barn door, however it has the curved transmission bracket, no lip on the
cold air intakes, and a rolled panel door (1956 and older have a butted
panel).  So I have some parts that are traditionally 1955 and earlier some
that are 1956 and later.  Makes for finding parts very interesting.

Kind Regards,
Wayne
