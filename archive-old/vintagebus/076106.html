Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 06-26-03

Proceeded to finish getting the horn working on the Doubl Cab today. 
I ran a new wire down the steering column and installed a good 
condition button from my stash. Hooked up the horn lead to the fuse 
box, and with a push on the button...BEEP BEEP.....horn works!

Last on the short list was the liscense plate light. They gotta work 
in Texas or you can get a ticket. Most of all it'll get you pulled 
over so Johnny Law can poke around in your ride. No thanks Roscoe!!!!

I pulled the rusty housing and cleaned up the terminals on it. I made 
some new wires for it and hooked everything up. Worked like a charm!

Wow. I'd never believe 1 1/2 weeks ago there was absolutely nothing 
electrical than the starter that worked on this truck. Plus it was a 
bunch uglier. So I decided to call it a night on a good note.

When my order comes in I'll do the emergency brake cables and the 
speedo cable and I think I'll pass inspection at that point. So the 
rest will be basically done for fun or convenience. And until those 
cables come that's where I'm at. So I figure I'll start cleaning up 
the interior and fixing little things here and there. I've got a set 
of Porsche 914 seats that would fit the look of the truck. Maybe I'll 
look at putting those in. I'm out of cash for the most part so 
anything else that I havn't bought will have to be from my stash, 
barter, or REAL cheap.

Almost there.
