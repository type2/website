This message made me wonder about my rack....
does anyone know what style/model/era my rack is?  I know Greg (frankiehil) has
the same rack on his bus...full length too.  I've seen them around...some in 1/2
length etc.  mine is the full length and can be seen on Stella at
http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/bus.htm
I actually got this rack with the purchase of my 63....
needs to be blasted again and painted, but its not bent and none of the welds are
busted as far as I can tell :)
Thanks!
