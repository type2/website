Subject: Re: [VB] under pedal splash pans - how many kinds?

I have found with a little tin-snip action anyone can be made to fit--In
fact my 2 1967 buses the pedal pans are NOT the same ?  but they could have
been changed long before I got the bus--I did have to cut a bigger hole in
Bessie the 1967 to get it to clear the master cylinder--But the other 1967
has the small cut-out and no trimming was needed-- TWWM, uj
