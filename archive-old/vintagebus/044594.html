Hi all! Just bought a '67 Bus. I think its a stripped camper. Still has the
pop top, but nothing else. Just a re-built motor and a new paint job and a
bunch of new parts from West Coast Metrics thrown in. Just finished my &quot;Thing&quot;
restoration and 'am ready to start this one! However , I have a  bunch of
questions:

1) Can I convert this pop top to a canvas sunroof fairly easily?

2) Anybody have a good source for Safari windshields. Are they hard to
install?

3) Recomendations for a good restoration type manual for interior/exterior and
wiring diagrams?

4) Best way to lower vehicle height? I haven't looked at the wheel size yet,
but if its 15&quot; will going to 14&quot;' get me lower and are there any downsides?

Sorry, if I've gone overboard with the questions! Any help is greatly
appreciated.
