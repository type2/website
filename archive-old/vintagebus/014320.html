&gt; OK, now that Zorm (my 58 single cab) accelerates like my 914 :-), my

&gt; any

&gt; 
&gt; What I was thinking about was putting a nice solid metal grab handle
&gt; (like
&gt; the off-roaders use) on the frame above the passenger door (about
&gt; where your
&gt; hand would be if you held your arm out in front of you with your
&gt; elbow bent
&gt; up at 90 degrees).  Actually, I've been thinking about the same thing
&gt; in my
&gt; 73 Westy as well.  It would help my short er... I mean lovely wife
&gt; get in
&gt; and out of the buses as well.  Anybody ever done it, seen it, or know
&gt; any
&gt; good reason not to?

Fellow I knew put a nice grab handle in that general position in his
dune buggy.  First trip, his passenger bashed her head on it and cut
her scalp.  If you want a handhold there, better to install a nice
nylon strap that doesn't have any corners.
