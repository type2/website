on the flat lens H4's that I was getting I also found this problem and did
have to file on the tab openings a little, on the new curved lens ones that
I just got in, they fit like a regular bulb without fileing.

Subject: [VB] H4's dont fit?


hi all,

I bought some Taiwaneese H4's from a FLAPS (archway) the other day, but
they dont fit right...

To explain: 
on the back of a headlight, there are 3 square pegs that fit through slots
in the ring that the spring clips bear down on.

This ring has tabs that fit into the headlight bucket to keep the
headlight oriented properly.

on The H4's these square locator pegs are in the right palce, but they
dont fit through the slots.  They are on too big of a circle and i'd
either have to grind on my rings, or ???

Is this a problem with all H4's? or just el-cheapos. are my 61 headlight
parts different than newer ones or ???

Any assistnace would be appreciated.

thanks,

Steve
