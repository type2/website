Subject: Puyallup quest(I need a ride, bad!!!!!!)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list---
Here's my story... 

    I met a kid in Eugene at the U of O who was heading up to Puyallup and 
asked if i'd like to come along... I, who has been looking for a ride, was 
stoked!!!!
Anyway, he called me this am and said he got called into work on Sunday...

So, I'm determined to get to this show.  If anyone is in Eugene/Springfield 
greater area, and can give me a ride I will pay all of your gas. My other 
options are the amtrak... (Does anyone know the closes train station to the 
fairgrounds???
Any other ideas?
I wanna meet Eric and Barb, Jimmy, and all the NW listees...
And hopefully hit the swap... This would be my first show out west.
Thanks alot,
-Pete
