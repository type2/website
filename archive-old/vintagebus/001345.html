While I was out doing lumber deliveries around town today, I would stop into
my grandfather's shop and squirt a little penetrant on the RR brake drum
that was stuck and wouldn't come off.  I could see that the penetrant was
soaking down into the little hole I drilled into the snout on the brake
drum.  I also swung by NAPA and got their PB Blaster (which smells like
modified carb cleaner) with the drug induced labeling.  So tonight after
eating pizza with the grandparents, I stammered out into the shop and
started my work on the brake drum.  I sprayed tons of PB Blaster in the
hole, drilled another hole, drilled both holes out to 1/4&quot; and kept
spraying, hitting with the sledge hammer, and still attempting to use my
cobbled wheel adaptor/wheel puller assembly to pull of the drum and it
_STILL_ would not budge.  I resorted to the torch again and dousing with pb
blaster...there was no doubt about it - this stuff was getting inside where
it needed to be but the drum will wouldn't budge.

Let's step back a minute here.  After WWII, my grandfather came home from
the war.  He was in one of the first troops that went into Hiroshima after
the bombing.  He got a job as chief mechanic for the Old Home Bread plant
here in Beatrice, NE.  This was in an era where the &quot;big&quot; trucks used
straight 6 engines so a lot of his expertise is in these old Chevy 6 cyl.
trucks.  Over the years, he amassed quite a tool collection due to his job.
He occasionally tells me stories about using Carbon Tetrachloride to clean
the wax off the rollers on the bread wrapping machines (for when bread was
wrapped in wax paper and not in plastic).  He said that he used to clean
parts in it, use it on his bare hands, etc. and then it was banned or at
least put in the controlled substance category when it was found to be a
nasty carcinogen!

So tonight while I'm sitting there frustrated by this very stubborn brake
drum, I described to my grandfather how the VW tool works for pulling brake
drums and he says, &quot;I've got a 3 jaw puller in the basement that I used to
use at the bakery.&quot;  Of course at this point, I'll try anything so down the
steps we went and he pawed through a couple of tools boxes before he found
it.  Right away I knew it was winner - it's the weirdest little wheel puller
I've ever seen but the the jaws are totally adjutable so we were able to use
3 jaws with 2, bolted to the drum on one side and 1 bolted to the drum on
the other side.  I would tighten up the puller and then whack the end of the
threaded rod with the sledge about 10 times.  After 3 cycles of this, it
finally started popping it's way off ever so slowly.  It was tight to the
bitter end because of scaly rust that had formed in the splines.  Wow!!!
Thanks to my grandfather's OLD wheel pulling tool, I was good to go.  I'm
going to try to locate a few more jaws for this puller and then I'll have
the ultimate 5 lug VW drum pulling tool!

At this point, it was time for a tea brake followed by the rear bumper
removal.  Tomorrow I'll pull the engine.
