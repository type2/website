Subject: Re: [VB] Oxidized Paint fixes

Mash the Color Charts index tab at the top of the page on the WW site for a 
limited selection.  

Also http://www.paintscratch_dot_com has a wide selection.  I ordered some Pearl 
White through them but have not tried it yet...

buses with too much mechanical stuff going on to worry about paint at the 
moment:

'63 single cab  Mr. Gorsky


&gt; Perhaps this is flogging a dead horse but here it goes.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 65  sealing wax red/beige grey buswith original paint that is
&gt; quite heavily oxidized from sitting in the sun for years. I want to keep
&gt; the original paint but would like to revitalize its original shine as much
&gt; as possible. Note that the paint has burnt through in a few spots due to
&gt; sun damage. So what suggestions/products do people have for removing a
&gt; minimum of paint (as most polishing/buffing procedures do) while also
&gt; restoring the shine?
&gt; 
&gt; Other question- wasn't someone like Wolfsburg West selling touch up cans
&gt; of VW original paint? I had a look on their site and can't find any
&gt; mention of them any more. Anyone have any experience on how accurate their
&gt; touch ups are. I realize I can't expect miracles but something reasonably
&gt; close to the original would be nice.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
&gt;
