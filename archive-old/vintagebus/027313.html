I'm 6'3&quot; and the only problem I have in my bay is hitting the brights with my
knee....that can be interesting when in town.
I also bang my head on the roof sometimes when I go over railroad tracks..
no to mention...driving a splitty.  now I know why they call it a splitty.... the
other day when getting in... I split my pants trying to contort myself getting into
the bus.  whoops! hehe
big feet too I guess....I always hit the kick panel area in my split when pressing on
the clutch....anyone else have a problem with this?

adios
