Subject: dual circuit master cyl in split bus/ steering gear rebuilds/ camber compensator

This question came up today at the shop:

When someone replaces the original single-circuit master cylinder in a
'66 and earlier bus ( 211-611-019J?), or the scarce and over-priced dual
circuit for a '67 (211-611-021Q) with the adapter and a master made for
the later buses with a vacuum assist servo (211-611-021AA) where the
heck does the resevoir go? In the &quot;J&quot; and  &quot;Q&quot; masters it sits right on
the cylinder, thus accessable through the floor, but on the later ones
it takes a line and &quot;remote&quot; resevoir. Or can you fab one up to sit on
top of the cylinder?

I'm still running the original style in each of my splits, single
circuit  (and fingers crossed) in the '65 and original dual circuit( and
fingers crossed it doesn't ever neeed to be replaced at *&amp;^%$*#gazillion
dollars if you can find one) in the '67. 
We rebuilt a &quot;Q&quot; today for a fellow, but were uncertain about the
outcome due to some bad pitting inside the cyllinder, and have been
exploring options. Wolfgang and some other updaters are making the
donut-thingy that will allow you to upgrade to the &quot;aa&quot; dual circuit,
but I couldn't get an answer about the resevoir from them.

IN the same breath, I sent Wolfgang two sets of 64-67 king and link
spindles today and a steering gear. I sold them the spindles outright
for $50 each ( they are looking for more) and am getting a rebuilt
steering box for a bit more than they owe me on the spindles. 
Anyone ever use their rebuilt boxes? I'm gonna do the center pin at the
same time to get ready for the mexico trip, so I am hoping for
perfection......

I did recently install a camber compensator in my bus. Best money I ever
spent on it, and I'm not into bolt-on performance as a rule. But the
rear end does a whole lot less waggle, and corners feel much more
controllable, and semi trucks only push me a quarter of a lane. Got it
from CB performance, who screwed me on shipping. But the product is
nice.

More to come on the Mexico trip plans.... gonna give notice at work
tomorrow... Hope the boss isn't on line....
