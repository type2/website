Subject: '59 Kombi 1600cc engine...rod bearing

It occurred to me that maybe i might want to try and find out WHY the 
connector rod bearing failed on my engine. Here's some pictures of 
the connector rod bearings for #4 that were bad:

As you can see they were flattened and even flanged on the sides.

So what are the possible causes of this. Is it normal wear and tear? 
Or is this a symptom of another problem? Thanks.
