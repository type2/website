Joe,
What one-year-only oil pump?
for a 1500/1600 you can have dished or flat cam, and coresponding oil
pump, no? What am I missing? The galleys didn't match up?
You have 40hps and 1300 and 1500's with a 17mm gear oil pump, with holes
for 8mm galleys, 19mm, 8 mm galleys, 20 mm and 10mm galleys( like
70-only or 70-71?) then 24 and 26mm for later 1600's with 10mm galleys.
When the bigger pumps came out ( 24 and 26mm gears) they dished the cam
gear to make room, ans so these pumps need the right cam ( or better,
cam needs right pump)...Unless you put a small pump in a case with a
dished cam....a small pump in a case with 10mm galleys....yeah, that
would goof things up a bit... 
Or then again, did you possible use an auto-stick bug oil pump? This one
is a goofy two-stage jobber. But it should have worked ok too....
I'll be interested n what some of the gurus have to say...

I'd also be interested in the length of the oil pump gears, the size of
the case oil galleys, and whether yours is a dished or flat cam gear.
