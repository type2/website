Yep....sounds like it's worth a go....
&gt;
&gt; The 140 is the thicker of the two.  It would make your transmission
&gt; quieter, but stiffer until it got warmed up.  If your weather is
relatively
&gt; warm year round, it's usable.

Uh.... I was referring to the &quot;hard to shift&quot; bit.....the stick is really
pretty sloppy, so with better bushings, etc, I might be able to shift more
accurately....sure, I'm used to it already, but it's not right!
&gt;
&gt; Nope.   If it's howling, how would a shift bushing help?   I would do it
&gt; anyway, but don't expect a miracle.  The 140 *would* silence the hounds of
&gt; hell.
&gt;

Ya, so I'm a sucker......but I don't put that stuff in engines........(The
tranny in my Z didn't improve until after the addition of Slick 50.....and
it had been a while since the gear oil change, so I just don't know what to
think.....maybe placebos work for cars?)

&gt; Ick.  Slick50 is a cash transfer device.  From your wallet to theirs.
&gt;
&gt; As with any of the pour-in panaceas, does anyone ever stop to consider
that
&gt; the just-realized improvement is probably due to changing the stuff?  Like
&gt; the people who swear by the twin-prong plugs - &quot;uh, I get better mileage
&gt; now.&quot;  Well, Jethro, when was the last time you'd *changed* the plugs, or
&gt; gear oil, or motor oil, etc, etc.
