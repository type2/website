Subject: Re: [VB] Re: bus on TheSamba

Maybe it's my browser, or it's late, but that bus rear image has got a
lot
of spare room back there in the engine compartment - looks like he forgot
to install the GEX (maybe it's already gone out!). cal
------------------------ Clip -----------------------------
It isn't your browser ............. I enhansed the image and the engine
bay is empty.
Guess he's going to buy one if somebody comes with the money.
Somebody should ask if they can have a Jake Raby engine with the bus for
the same price.
