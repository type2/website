Dear Mr. Hoover,
If you'll please read ALL the Hoover posts of late, you'll realize
that _I_ was not the one calling you names, insulting your knowledge,
or otherwise being nasty and rude.  I merely suggested that I did not
find it very motivating to be told that unless I had 40 years of VW
experience as you do, I should not drive my bus daily, which I do, and
LOVE doing, without any problems.  This is the very reason I was and
am STILL not sure how the brunt of all this got dumped on me.  Why
don't you pick some of the questions and answers posted to you by some
of the OTHER people who really seemed to disrespect you by way of
nasty name-calling and rude comments?  Why do you insist  on
continuing this with ME when I was the ONLY one to post a public
apology to the entire list, or didn't you read THAT post? I am in full
agreement that you DO have a wealth of knowledge, and I offer my
sincere best wishes on the sale of your forthcoming book, but I really
hope WE can stop all of this NOW, as I can do no more than what I have
already done, and that was my sincere apology.  Thank you.

Michele Putman
