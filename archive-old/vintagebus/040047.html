hey now,
thank god there are people like kelly around! not only is he a bus lover 
like all of us, but he is a &quot;wiz&quot; at making them new again. if that was my 
60 Kombi, i would have sent it to the compactor long ago. the 56 sunroof is 
sweet, (sand &amp; palm green like mine ;) but that was wasted too! here in 
cleveland, i went to at least 10 places to get my driver side rocker done 
for me. NOT 1 PLACE would do the work!!!! what the F#ck! i couldnt give my 
money away. a stupid rocker panel, easy stuff. i was getting so pissed, i 
decided to do it myself. i was worried that the whold side would just 
ripple, ripple, ripple. actually, it turned out pretty damn good... good 
enough for me at least. now, the thing is those other 10 jack offs didnt 
want my work cuz they make more money doing insurance jobs where all they 
have to do is unbolt the panels, bolt on and spray. and who knows, maybe 
they didnt even know how to cut, grind, bend and weld something like that.
