Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Insurance

Small world!

I tried to get Hagarty to insure my '60 DD and they said &quot;no way&quot; when I
told them I had 3 speeding tickets. The fact that they were all in my
200hp GTI didn't matter to them. The fact that my bus won't break 60mph
didn't matter to them. Eventually, my squeakly-clean girlfriend (now
wife) had to step in for the policy to even be a matter of discussion.

We're both on USAA now, ThankYouVeryMuch.

Writ Justyn:

What the prospective Hagarty (or other classic car insurance company)
customer does not know, is that they need to have a near perfect driving
record. Somehow they caught wind of a traffic ticket (one of only 2 I've
had), which was for around 18 MPH over the speed limit. After this, they
refused to insure anymore one of my vehicles.
