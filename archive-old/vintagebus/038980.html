Subject: [VB] 67 master cylinders again
Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.944862477.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

Ok, I know this has been covered before but even Eric &amp; Barb's
article in the type2_dot_com tech library and various messages in the
archives don't seem to have *all* the details.

To set the scene: I've got a stock '67 Kombi which has dual-circuit brakes
and what looks like an OE master cylinder.  If the MC is like the rest of
the brake system, it's got some rust in it since the bus sat for several years.
It doesn't leak, but braking is a little weird sometimes and takes an
extra pump to make the pedal firm (I've already flushed and bled it).
All wheel cylinders have been replaced or rebuilt, and the hoses are new.
I just want to get a new M/C since rebuild kits for the '67 don't seem
to be available -- and for that reason, I want to convert it to a later
m/c rather than use one of the rare and expensive '67 replacements.

So, I've got a nice plate of 1/4&quot; aluminum to make the spacer out of.
It's a stock '67 so I've got the dual-circuit reservoir.

When I talked to Bus Depot, they said all the '71-later MCs are made for
a servo, but a '70 would bolt up for this conversion, so I got the '70
MC, part number 211 611 021T.

The only real problem with this MC is that its inlets for the brake fluid
reservoir are farther apart than on the '67!  They are approximately
100mm on center (3-7/8&quot;), while the 67's are about 85mm on center,
or about 3-5/16&quot; (measured center-to-center).  The brake lines &amp; etc will
bolt right up with minimal tweaking.

So, the only 71-79 MC available, part number 211 611 021AA, is for the
power servo system.  It has a shaft sticking out instead of the hole for
the pushrod.  Is this really the part I want for the conversion?  Does
the shaft come out?

    thanks,

    -- Larry
