&gt; IRS reduction boxes!

Dave Folts Trans has something similar to this.  They fabricate
something that allows the use of a 091 gearbox (75-91 vanagon) in a
swingaxle car.  It is basically modified axle tubes with a u-joint at
the trans side.  With a little more modifying, I'm sure reduction boxes
could be used.

I might add that I seem to remember that the Folts set-up is rather
expensive.  It was developed mainly for drag racing though.
