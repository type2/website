Subject: Looking for wood slats for my double cab.

Hi All,

I used to have two leads on people that made some correct wood slats for
pickups but both have turned up to be dead ends...
Is there anyone else producing these things?  I could do it myself if
someone could tell me the correct lengths.

Thanks
David
