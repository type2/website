Clap on / Clap off???

&gt; I remember a thread a while ago about upgrading the
headlight dimmer switch 
&gt; to new technology. Mine is starting to give me fits. I have added power 
&gt; relays, so the voltages are okay. The switch keeps hanging up too much. Any 
&gt; info on modern upgrades? Thanks
