I think it's an OK idea,
don't be a prick to people who are trying
to help your cause.

&gt; He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
&gt; before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
&gt; think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted

&gt;
&gt; Hey, Ted,
&gt;
&gt; Here's a thought to help increase the list's funds.  If you decline I
&gt; understand why, but I thought I'd offer...
&gt;
&gt; It would be very easy for me to add a part number TYPE2DONATE to the Bus
&gt; Depot website, for a value of $5 or $10 (although a quantity of more than
1
&gt; could be selected if the person wanted to donate more). This would allow
&gt; anyone who bought something at the Depot to at the same time donate to the
&gt; list (or perhaps choose to take the money he saved with his listmember
&gt; discount and apply it as a donation to the list).  This isn't intended to
&gt; replace your Paypal account, which is for people who are specifically
&gt; donating to the list, but rather to augment it with &quot;impulse donations&quot;
from
&gt; people who are buying parts. Kind of the e-commerce equivalent of the can
at
&gt; the cash register where you put your spare change to support the SPCA or
&gt; whatever.
&gt;
&gt; When we send out our accounts-payable checks about once a month, I could
cut
&gt; you a check for the total of the amount received.  (It would be easy to
&gt; track; all I'd have to do is run a report of sales of part number
&gt; TYPE2DONATE, then multiply the &quot;quantity sold&quot; by the &quot;value&quot; that we
chose
&gt; each &quot;unit&quot; to be, $5 or $10.)  For my part of the donation, I'd absorb
the
&gt; 2% credit card processing fee, so you'd get the full value of the donation
&gt; without credit card/paypal costs.
&gt;
&gt; My thought is that many people would donate that way if it were as easy as
&gt; clicking a button while they are already making a purchase anyway.  It
would
&gt; increase the donations significantly if each listmember who ordered a part
&gt; for their bus threw in even just $5 toward the list each time they
ordered.
&gt;
&gt; Of course I'd be more than happy to agree to a post from the list
&gt; administrators clearly stating that the ability to donate this way is not
&gt; intended to imply endorsement of The Bus Depot.
&gt;
&gt; The offer is open if you want to take me up on it.
