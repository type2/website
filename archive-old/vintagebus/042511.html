Hi thom,

sounds like your situation is the same as mine.  the passemger side one
firmed right up after one application of loctite. The drivers side one
that had fallen apart needed a couple of applications.

Basically i just kept putting the stuff on until the gap between the
washer and the mirror was filled solid.  Both are now pretty vibration
free. (1 application passenger side... on drivers side i had to apply
once, wait till it set and apply again)

And, i gave bad info on how long it takes to completely cure.  24 hours
for a total set.  But, i'm sure if one does it before bed it'll be fine by
the next AM... (thats what i did on the second application to the drivers
side..) I'm guessing that if one waits the 24 hours the first time around
the stuff isnt as likely to leak out and force one to apply a second
time...

Coudl also be that the one that is still wobbly has a bigger gap to fill
and will take closer to that 24 hours to finish de-wobbling?

Now we'll just have to see how this holds up over time :)

take care,

Steve
