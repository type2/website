the

&gt;  
&gt;  This is a serious issue, as you will be towing 2500-3000 pounds of
&gt;  unbraked mass.  If you tow with a vehicle of equal mass, then all of
&gt;  your braking distances will double, assuming that you can keep the
&gt;  whole works going in the same direction.

&gt; Hi George,
&gt; The pre-1968 bug wieghs about 1200 lbs. and the pre-1968 bus wieghs
about 1600
&gt; lbs...

Well, this is the weight before you start adding all those extra bits,
pieces, and spares that came along with the &quot;new&quot; bus.  An engine (who
can pass one up, even if a rod is sticking out of the top!),
transmission, front beam, etc. always seem to come with the new &quot;find&quot;
often at the insistance of the spouse of the PO!
