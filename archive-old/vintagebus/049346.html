Subject: Re: [VB] Hatch Bikes Racks Now Available

Mebbe it is just my bus (65 westy) but i have found on the plsits there is =
less clearance between the top of the rear hatch and the drip rails on &lt;68 =
busses. This makes it harder to mount rear hatch style racks on &lt;68 =
busses.

&lt;&lt; It says on the web site that they only fit bays but I
dont see what is the huge difference between a split

I'm not the expert, but I suspect your are correct.

Could there possibly be a difference in the hinges betwwen the years?

My only concern would be if the bays can somehow support the weight and =

the earlier models.
