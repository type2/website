Subject: Too tight steering
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.0012181238500.9589-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


Ever since I've owned my '57 bus the steering has been too tight.  It got
so bad once that it actually locked up on me and it ended up being the
right spindle was froze on the king pin.  But now that I have new dropped
spindles I thought that would solve it, but it is as tight as ever.

When I say &quot;tight&quot; I mean that it is difficult to steer for one thing, and
the steering doesn't &quot;return&quot; after turning a corner like most cars and
type2s should.  I really have to reef on that thing to get it back to
straight.

Anyway, I was thinking it might be the steering box, but thought I'd see
if anybody else has had this problem.
