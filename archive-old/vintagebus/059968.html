Subject: Re: [VB] Bus is hot need help


&gt; I have it at about 11 degrees ATDC, it's running well and idles fine
&gt; around 900 bud it is damn hot.  All my tin is in place and the progressive
&gt; ran pretty cool, but too rich no matter what.   So what gives? 34 pict 3
on
&gt; an AE case w/ 009.

Using a timing light, the 009 total advance should be 32 deg with a 009. The
setting
of  7.5 BTDC mentioned by Ed is correct to get you there.

Anything beyond this setting, the motor usually sounds great but the temp
starts
going way up........

My 1600 DP w/34 PICT 3 and 009 at this setting runs 195-200 degrees at 55
mph on average.
