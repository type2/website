Just introduced? I thought they have been selling that junk for awhile now? 
There are some things they the repop gods wont spend big money on to make it 
look nice. Save you self some dollars and wrap some tin foil around your old 
ones, or get some chrome paint. Or, find originals.

&lt;&lt; Wolfsburg West just introduced the commercial line gray hubcaps, they seem 
to 
 be of good quality. I wouldn't be surprised if they offered good chrome ones 
 as well.
