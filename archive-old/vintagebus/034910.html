 I'm new to the list.  I just bought a '64 Standard Microbus from
 about the 3rd owner.  It's blue-white and turquoise (L 289, L 380).
 It has a 1500 engine from a '68 Bug.  Six pop-out windows, missing
 the middle seat. 
..........................
beautiful, I love that colour, especially with the 64 only that colour scheme 
tinted green real vinyl headliner.  enjoy!
./////////////////////

  It's still 6 volt.  I've figured out all the
 M-codes except &quot;426&quot; (seems to be some guesses that this is a 
 US-equipment code) and which port &quot;F&quot; was.  This Bus was built on 
 15 November 1963. 
 
 Anyway...I have a few questions. ...
 The first thing I have to replace is the fuel lines (one of the
 rubber ones leaks under pressure).  Right now all the fuel line
 is rubber with the braided covering, but I'm wondering if I'm
 missing some of the metal line.  It has braided hose from the
 tank outlet, through the little clip on the bottom of the floor
 above the tranny, and through the front engine tin.  Right
 around #4 cylinder it is clamped on to a metal line, which
 runs around almost to the fuel pump, with a short &quot;jumper&quot;
 to the pump inlet.  Should that metal line run on around and
 through the tin (with a grommet)?  Seems like the rubber line
 could get cut up on the tin.  I do plan to put NEW stainless
 worm-gear clamps on all the connections.
..............................
good idea to replace all the rubber fuel lines.  while you are at it you 
might well pull the drain spout out of the gas tank and replace the fuel sock 
type filter (it is a metal mesh sock) in the tank.    
The metal line yes should run around through the tin with a grommet, but it 
probably became grommet free and worn through at some point.
Myself I only bother with clamps where the fuel is under pressure (I use the 
correct braided German line which does not slide off) and dont bother with 
between the tank and pump, though many people do.
 ==================
 Does anyone know the specs on a Bosch &quot;031&quot; distributor?  The
 full number is 0 231 129 031.  I'm trying to figure out if
 this is something close to &quot;right&quot; for this engine or if I
 need to change it out.
 .................
not offhand, but if it works I wouldn't think you would need to get rid of 
it.  There are many distributors.
//////////////////////////////
 The PO claimed that the odometer was reset to zero when the
 new engine was installed.  If that's true, the engine has
 around 57k miles.  But I'd also think this would run afoul
 of the various odometer laws.  Anyone ever heard of this
 before? 
 ............................
I think if it has run over 100K miles you just check that box for the title 
transfer, and they don't even care after the car is 10 years old.  
////////////////////////////////
 I took the headlight buckets out tonight and discovered
 something interesting.  The stock VW yellow/white/brown
 wires are spliced (with non-VW-looking splices) to a
 standard 3-lug sealed-beam connector.  The connector wires
 seem to have a fabric covering.  The owner's manual I got
 with the Bus (in English, Aug. '63 edition) shows the
 old-style separate bulb and reflector setup.  Is it
 possible that this was converted to sealed-beams sometime
 later in life, or...?
 ---------------------
probably not converted from the euro version.  I have seen the same deal on 
us spec buses.

If you are doing the once over to catch up on delayed maintenance, here's 
some more to think about

grease suspension
check tranny boots -replace if cracked or torn
change gear oil (center and RGBoxes at same time)
inspect and repack front wheel bearings
replace rubber brake hoses if it hasn't been done in 5 years
check all wheels for leaky cylinders
check for existance of front shift bushing- install if missing or worn.
check rear shift coupler for wear/wiggling
drain and refilll steering gear box and adjust.
oil all hinges
