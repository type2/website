Subject: Re: [VB] Tie rods

Oh, and that's less than $100 for *BOTH* - they're a tad under $40
each.  Plusshipping.  Plus tax, license and doc fees.

&gt; Greetings to the list from long time lurker, first time writer.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently in the throes of restoration of a 67 SC, TUBAVAGEN,  which was
&gt; severely mistreated in its previous life as a plumber's truck in Opelika,
&gt; Alabama.  The engine is now purring and the brakes do an adequate job of
&gt; stopping.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now it's time to tame the steering!  Currently the truck seems to take my
&gt; steering input as merely a good suggestion as we wander down the highway.
&gt; I've been under the front end and taken the backlash out of the steering
&gt; box. (But not too tight - I've read the posts!)  While under there I noticed
&gt; side to side play in both front wheels.  (No up and down play - the bearings
&gt; were checked and adjusted when the brake wheel cylinders were replaced on
&gt; both sides).  All of the movement seems to be coming from looseness in the
&gt; outer tie rod ends on both sides.  Both inner tie rod ends appear tight - no
&gt; real play in any direction.  
&gt; 
&gt; Question:	Can I get away with just changing the ends, or should I buy
&gt; new tie rods for both sides since both ends are definitely OE parts with a
&gt; 35-year history of banging down dirt roads?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
