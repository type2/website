Subject: why I hate bosch super plugs

wow. what is it about those plugs that make my engine run like crap. I
had it out for some maintenance and wanted to do a tuneup. A trip to
my local VWFLAPS went well, but no ngk like I usually run. I went
ahead and got some supers. Put them in and there was a definate loss
of power, and the engine would not idle worth a crap. FFWD a few days
and I put some ngks back in. idles properly, and works without any
problem. I'd love to know why those supers don't work with my engine,
but at least ngk works great (and this time I got an extra set)
