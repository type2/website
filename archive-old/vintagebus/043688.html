&gt;&quot;[...] A camp stove of your favorite type comes out of the engine 
&gt;compartment, where there was more than enough room for it;&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Stove in the engine compartment?????????

I think I saw on one of the Westy brochures floating around on Thom's
or Everett's site that you could get a stove that swung out from or
hung on the back of the Bus, between the hatch and the the engine lid.

Otherwise, I think what they meant is that if you didn't have a gas
heater, that (mostly) empty spot on the left side was a good spot
for the camp stove you already owned - not that it came with one.
