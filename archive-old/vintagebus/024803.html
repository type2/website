All, I think that the Brazilian 009's may not be as well made or give
as accurate an advance curve as the German made 009 that I do use with
success on a SP 1600.  I also run a mechanical advance distributor on my
1500 SP in my '66.  This is a Bosch 031.  I like this one's advance
curve better than the 009.  My wife's Super Beetle runs with a vacuum
advance distributor.   Gary Gibson
