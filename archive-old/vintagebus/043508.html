&gt;Even Ace has &quot;sold out&quot; and is becoming more &quot;home depot-esque&quot; - all of
&gt;their tools are now the cheepie taiwanese crap, and more and more of their
&gt;fasteners are baggie-ware.

Maybe this is a regional thing.  Here in Oklahoma I haven't found this
as much.  Also, I think Ace has at least two kinds of stores - the
big Home Depot-type &quot;Ace&quot; ones which I think are &quot;company owned&quot; and the
smaller ones like &quot;Bob's Ace Hardware&quot; which I think are some kind
of &quot;franchise&quot; or &quot;associate&quot; deal.  The latter are the ones I'm
talking about. 

&gt;The Orchard Supply in Citrus Heights has this one turnbuckle in stock
&gt;that's about 4' long, must weight 100 pounds easily.  No idea what's it's
&gt;for, or why in the heck they have it in stock.  It's $150

I have seen big turnbuckles used in steel-frame building construction.
Generally there are big I-beams forming a square, and steel rods on
the diagonal to help keep it square.  Sometimes the rods (1/2&quot; - 1&quot;
diameter, 12 to 25 mm) have turnbuckles in the middle for adjusting.
