I just got my bus back from restoration.  One of the things I had them
do was spray the interior with Armothane - it's the plastic/rubbery
stuff you see in a lot of pickup beds.  The doors have solid thuds
now, and this stuff is a fairly good insulator as well.  The final
attraction was that it is waterproof and since it goes on as a liquid,
I'm not nearly as worried about rust as I was before.  We also
undercoated the bus, but I'm pretty sure that's not the same stuff.
My only complaint is that they didn't spray inside the nose.  On the
other hand, I can still distinguish the colours of the various wires,
so it might not be *that* bad of a tradeoff.
