Subject: Re: [VB] Have to disable a bus

&quot; I found a buyer for the pristine 67 Deluxe, problem is he is only 15 years
old and his mom does not trust him. Apparently, he wears tie-dye so must do
drugs and stuff like that. In addition, his hair is kinda shaggy looking.

Anyway, his mom has agreed to cough up the cash for him (money not a problem
in that family) but she wants me to disable the bus, as she is afraid he
will try to drive it w/o his license. She knows that VW buses are unsafe and
she wants it stopped forever, not a temporary disabling. I thought about
pouring something in the crankcase just after I deliver it to seize the
whole thing up after a few miles but kinda hate to do that to the original
engine, as it runs so sweet. A bad dizzy cap kept it parked inside 30 years.
I know it is a real find but money talks here.

Another idea is to try to rip out some wires under the bus as it has a belly
pan due to the double sliding doors.  Must have been a right hand drive
option.

The kid is a straight A student so will figure out anything obvious.

Thanks for the help!&quot;
----------------------------
Instead of doing harm to the bus and defeating the purpose, how about just
printing out some clippings of news from some teenage driving tragedies, along
with a few pictures of his mom, and plaster them all over the engine bay and
under the chassis. Or ask them to pay for the labor for you to take the engine
out after you delivered the bus.

If you worry about the future driver and it weighs heavy on you, don't sell
it to the kid. Or if you think it's his mom that's overbearing, let her worry
about the developement. Since they front the cash with no grimmace whatsoever,
it's their affluenza, not yours. Couldn't they rent a storage for a year?

Or is this an April Fool's story.
