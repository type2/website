&quot;Id like to undercoat my '59 panel when it gets back from the bodyshop. It

a few very minimal spots of surface rust. Would you suggest POR-15 for
this?&quot;


I wrote to POR15 asking this question cause it was not covered in their FAQ
on their site..here was their reply...

&gt;hello,
&gt;I was wanting to take a vehicle and have the underside of it pressure
&gt;washed. then I was wanting to POR15 on it. Will the chemicals from
&gt;the pressure washing have any negative effect on the por15 even if its
&gt;completely dry? (want to avoid cleaning it by hand)

ANSWER - Power washing is a common way to clean a surface before using
POR-15, just make sure the cleaner you use is a good water-soluble cleaner
and that the surface is rinsed good and then must be completely dry.
