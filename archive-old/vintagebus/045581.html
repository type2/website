Hey , Congrats on the splitt.

A big puddle dripping from between the engine and trans would be the main 
seal.   You have pretty much the same motor in the split as in the bug or a 
bus through 71.     
However, it is far easier to remove it from a splitty.  :)  I am guessing you 
have a 1600 motor.

Giving the engine a thorough spraying with simple Green in the engine 
compartment, and underneath, and wait an hour or so, and then rinsing it off 
at the high pressure car wash will make pulling the motor much pleasanter.   
Often the engine compartment paint is well preserved by the crud, and looks 
great after a wash.  Avoid hosing the paper fresh air hoses, and the dist. if 
water gets in the dist cap, it wont run, so you have to wipe it out with a 
clean dry rag to start it.

I would pull the fan shroud while the motor is out and replace the oil cooler 
seals.  

also replace old fuel line from tank to motor.
check the trans axle boots - if they are bad (cracked or ripped) replace them 
while the motor is out,    drain the trans oil (2 drain plugs) and fill it 
with clean gl-4 rating oil.  These are much easier to fill when engine is 
out, as you can sit where the engine was and not be lying underneath getting 
oil and gas dripped on you.

how is the engine compartment seal?

 Howdy All,
 I just brought my new '66 Standard home last night, My first splittie!!!  
Anyway, after finally getting it started, and letting it run for a few 
minutes, there was a big oil puddle under the center rear(toward the front of 
the bus) of the engine.  On the bay windows, I know that oil cooler leaks 
seem to spot on the drivers side toward the front of the engine.  In the 
splits, is it in the same place or do I probably have a main seal leaking.  
If so, what is this seal actually called, so I know what to look for when 
doing the research.  Thanks in advance!
