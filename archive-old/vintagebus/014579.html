Not really.  The '67 should have a 12 volt nose cone with the
back up light switch and the smaller 12 volt starter bushing
but that's about all I can think of to identify what it is externally.

actually the back up light was added part way through the67 model year, so an
early 67 wouldn't have it.     But that could get switched around aryway, so
it doesn't really show  what year the tranny is or what's inside it, as Todd
said.
