WHOA! this is DEFINITELY NOT a money issue for me. this is 
a good parts source and the change to get what i need for the future and for 
others to do so as well. if this were a money issue, i'd just sell it and be 
done.

i am NOT in this for money, and this is NOT why i am 
considering these options.

 sure, i like money, but i have a job for 
that!

    I have seen some very clean kombis cut to pieces

  for a couple pieces of

  sheet metal to save Deluxes ( a waste in my

  opinion), but the people doing

  it make a lot more money on a pieced together Deluxe

  then they would of on a

  nice dry Kombi!

  

  ronnie  it's your stuff do what you need to do

  

 

And we all love money, in fact that's why we do this,

for the love of the money.

Mike
