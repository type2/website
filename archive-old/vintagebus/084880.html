&gt; Anybody ever heard of a 32 PICT 5?

Not on an air-cooled VW.  I didn't think any of the carb numbers ever
went as high as -5; the Without Guesswork manuals at the doc project
(which cover through '72) don't have this number.

Google doesn't know much about it either.  Searching for &quot;32 pict 5&quot;
turns up one Web forum in Polish and nothing else.  Without the quotes,
there are a couple of hits for a company that sells rebuilt carbs and
carb kits; the only thing close they list is a 34 PICT-5, which is for a
Wabbit.  In contrast, Googling for good carb numbers like &quot;28 PICT&quot;
turns up lots of relevant hits.

&gt; I was talking to somebody who said it came on the optional 1500 in 63.

Bentley says only 28 PICT, 28 PICT-1, or 30 PICT-1 on the Bus 1500.
