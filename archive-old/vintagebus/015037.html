I have a theory about the tags being removed in some buses.
The vin plate in my '55 had been removed as well, and the VIN
on the pink slip didn't match the VIN on the car - someone added extra 
numbers for some reason.  I thnk a subsequent owner removed the plate so 
it wouldn't be obvious that the numbers were wrong, rather than go down to 
DMV and clear it up.  

My '60 panel has the exact same problem - they transposed numbers on the
VIN, and added a couple, from Day One (I got it from the original 
registered owner) - luckily nobody decided to hide the efidence and
remove the plates!
