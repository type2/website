&lt;&lt; isn't this a split bus list, I thought type 2 was another list, Thom??? &gt;&gt;
Yes, it is, but as you may have noticed there are a lot of early bay's out 
there with upright engines that straddle both lists. There's also, judging by 
the sig lines a lot of split owners that also own bays. And of course I'm 
sure there's a bunch of folks that just want to own a split.
 
I posted both lists because I hate to see any dry bus go to the crusher and I 
felt this bus had some unique things. Apparently many split owners had never 
run across these features and had questions. I think the subject was at least 
as germane as say 356 Porsche's and pics of 'Bay' Dormobile conversions

This wouldn't be a case of 'split' snobbery would it?

Ps I also have a rear seat in fair shape free for the taking
