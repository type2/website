&lt;&lt; Hey, I'm looking to get new tires for my 60 and was wonderig if anyone
 had any suggestions.  What would be the ideal size for my bus? &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
205/75R15s, and just make sure to get them in as high a load rating as 
possible.  This radial size is as big as you can install in your pre-1963 bus 
and are just a little smaller diameter than the stock bias ply.    Eric&amp;Barb
