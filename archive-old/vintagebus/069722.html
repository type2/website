Subject: bus radio 12 to 6

What is the easiest way to drop down my voltage for my bus? I tried to use the
thing it came with , but no luck. I'm about as fustrated as I can get right
now. Damn radio has given me hell. I really don't know why I don't pull out
the radio and put a decent one in there. Anybody got like a hidden radio they
really use? Maybe hidden up under the parcel tray somewhere that they can pull
out during vw shows?
thanks
john
