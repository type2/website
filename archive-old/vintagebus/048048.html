I'm wondering if it has more to do with spraying the lighter color first then 
the darker color.  Seems like the older busses had the darker color on top 
while the later had the lighter color on top.  Any painter out there who can 
tell us if this might be the case?

 &gt; Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
 &gt; the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
 &gt; beltline. 59 and on the top color was painted over the entire bus and the 
bottom color was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the 
beltline down. &gt;&gt;
