I went to the Vallejo show and arrived a bit late, around noon. I stupidly
paid the $20.00 fee to take my 63 singlecab in to the show and get some
goodies. When I went to the event tet they had no goodies and said they ran
out at 10:30 am. So I sated out feeling somewhat conned and stupid, as I could
have parked for $2.00 and got in for $10.00 by walking 20 yards.

The show was a lot smaller that I expected, as compared to Kelley Park &amp;
bugorama. I did get the chrome treasure chest lock cover for the snglcab that
I was looking for, so not a total loss. I went with my new digital camera and
took a few piccies that I will post sometime this week. There was an awesomw
67 camper with awnings, and all the goodies. A nice 55 'barndoor' singlecab in
restoration process and just a few other neat buses.

Ir was sort of a long drive for not much but I do have my keyhole cover!!!!
