&gt;When buying batteries, divide the price by the warranty period in
&gt;months and buy the battery with the least dollars per month.

Well, or divide the price by the life of the battery and compare it to the
above. Seems like you guys are overspending. Up to your neighborhood Auto
Zone and they have a big wire rack of &quot;rebuilt&quot; batteries that run around
$17 last I checked. Some of them are jumbo-sized but they're all one price.
I normally get 3-5 years out of one of these and I've bought a good few
over the cars and years. Looks like around 50c per month, worst case.
