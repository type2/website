I don't know why in the hell I couldn't make such a simple post without
screwing it up twice.  I can't imagine this post will be any different.  All
I wanted to do is advertise some air correction jets and on my first post I
left out the jet size and the second post I botched the subject up.  Geesh -
sorry about that.  It's been a long week - hauling sheetrock all day long
for 5 days taxes a person to the max.

Again, sorry for the major screw up...
