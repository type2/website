Since it is Friday, thought I would put one last post about the Bus Fest. 
Only 2 weeks away!

The event is for all busses and bus fellowship. No fancy activities except 
the Blue Ridge Parkway drive on Sunday. Come to relax. It is well attended 
each year, and is a lot of fun. Should be a bunch of kids there this year. 
Several listees will be there starting on Friday.
