&gt;I saw an adapter somewhere the would enable me to put a dual circuit 
&gt;master from a late model bus. Does anyone know who supplies this?

I got mine from Wolfgang, http://www.wolfgangint_dot_com/ .  It's basically
a big aluminum donut or thick washer with three holes in it - one big
hole for the nose of the master cylinder and two little ones for the
mounting bolts.  It also comes with two longer bolts, the rubber
boot that goes around the push rod, and two new rubber inserts for
the reservoir mounting.

The directions that come with it tell you the part number of the
master cylinder to use.  If you use the Brazilian (common, cheap)
one, it fits fine and lets you use the rubber push rod boot.  If
you spring for a German (less common, expensive) master cylinder,
with the *same* part number, you will have to machine the ID of
the adapter a bit to get it to fit and you may have to leave off
the push rod boot.  It's aluminum so you can do it easily with a
file or a Dremel, but it does take a little work.

I'm not sure if the rubber bits for the reservoir are needed or
not.  I put the reservoir from an early 80s Rabbit on mine,
using the grommets that came with the master cylinder, and it
seems like it might be leaking a little around the grommets.
I haven't yet tried the ones that came with the adapter to
see if they help.

There is a good write-up on this conversion at
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/brakes/dualmas.htm .  Note that with
the adapter from Wolfgang, you don't need to cut the push rod -
just adjust it.

Good luck!
