&gt;  
&gt;  5.  Install a 68-71 gas tank in your 65 bus to get 15 gallons instead of 
the 
&gt; 
&gt;  10ish gallons pre-1968 bus tank.  Installing reserve switches really helps 
&gt; to 
&gt;  shut off the fuel when removing the engine or replacing the flexable fuel 
&gt;  lines.  No more laying under your bus in a pool of fuel and on trips where 
&gt;  you might run out of fuel you can manually switch to reserve by reaching 
&gt;  under your bus if you do not install the reserve cable.  Also helps as a 
&gt;  theft prevention when left in off position.pump on the engine for the 65 
to keep 
&gt;  the bearings from being prematurely worn from the metalic debris/dust 
going 
&gt;  through them!  Unfortunitly due to the rear engine hanger used on 68-71 
&gt; buses 
&gt;  this will not fit your 71 bus as of yet.
-------------
check the fuel sock while you are at it, even if you don't get a fuel tap.  
SO much easier with the engine out.  Where the gas comes out of the tank 
there is a fine mesh 'sock' in the tank the gas passes through before exiting 
the tank.
