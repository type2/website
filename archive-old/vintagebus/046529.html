Hi everyone,

	I just returned from 2 weeks of badly needed vacation time and thought
I'd share my road trip with you all.  So if you're not into reading
these, hit the DELETE key now. . .

	This past weekend, my wife and I decided that it was high time we had
some quality &quot;together time&quot; away from our kids so we made arrangements
with Grandma &amp; Grandpa to watch the littleones and we headed out on
Thursday afternoon.  The night before, I did a pre trip oil/tranny oil
change/valve adjustment/tune and I had packed up the '66 E-Z with what
seemed like everything we own + the kitchen sink too.  We were ready!!

	We made our way from Bremerton down to Olympia to drop the kids off
with the grandparents and then proceeded up Hwy 101 to our first
destination: Sol Duc Falls.  It was quite rainy and it was a very slow
trip past Port Angeles so at around 10:00pm, we decided to call it a
night and stopped just west of Crescent Lake at the Fairholm campground.
 We had the whole place to our selves. We went to bed with the relaxing
sound of rain drops on German steel.

	When we awoke, the rain had stoped and partly cloudy skies appeared.
We had to drive back to Pt Angeles since I forgot to fill up on our way
through the night before (oops) and made our way up to the Sol Duc Falls
trail head.  We made lunch and then took the short hike (0.8 mi) to the
falls.  Saw several Pro photographers taking pictures at the falls and
along the way.  After the hike back, we decided the Hotsprings were in
order and took a loooong soak in the springs.  We had a little shower
while we were there but we didn't care.  We also met a couple with an
'84 Vanagon that were there and swapped a few lies with 'em.

	Saturday morning we gathered our things and headed to Lake Ozette on
the NW corner of the Olympic Pen.  The weather was even better so after
we set-up camp, we made the hike out to the coast (3.3 mi).  For those
of you who haven't been there, the entire trail is made out of wood!!
You actually walk for about 3 full miles on a 2.5 foot wide &quot;sidewalk&quot;
of wood elevated about 6&quot; above the damp and fragile earth through the
old-growth rain forest!!  It's something that must be experienced!!  We
had a fun time looking in the tide pools and picking up sand glass.  

	That night I made a wonderful feast of (drum roll please) . . .
Hamburger Helper w/ baked beans!!  After the hike out and back, I
thought I was eating a steak dinner in a box ;-)  The evening campfire
was perfect with clear skies full of stars and no wind (read: very
little smoke in the face).  Only one thing was needed, a trip BACK to
the hotspring and another loooong soak!!  Next time we'll do Ozette
FIRST!!

	We ended our trip Sunday by heading south to the east side of Mayfield
Lake about 20 miles east of I-5, where we picked up our kids at my
sister's new cabin.  She was having a &quot;cabin warming&quot; get together with
the whole family.  After that, and the bus again full, we made our way
back to Bremerton and back to our warm beds.  

	What a GREAT weekend!!  This was my wife's first time camping in the
bus and she was VERY happy with the comfort and accommodations in our
little E-Z.  Maybe the &quot;company&quot; had something to do with it, heck I
don't know but she had a really good time too.  I knew I'd turned her on
to VW camping when she said, &quot;...I really love this bus!!!&quot;  That hasn't
ever come out of her lips EVER!!  She also liked the attention you get
driving an old splitty (I don't believe she's ever gotten a &quot;thumbs-up&quot;
or a &quot;peace sign&quot; driving our F*rd Aer*star!!  I wonder why?? ;-) ).

	On this trip we logged about 750 trouble-free miles and averaged 25.2
mpg and used about 1/2 pint of oil!!  Did I mention that my wife really
loves the bus now. . . ;-)  Thanks for reading this far.  I gotta go
plan our next trip w/ the kids though :-)
