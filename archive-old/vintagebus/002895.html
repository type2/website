Hey, Thanks to all for the input.

I really got sort of a mixed reaction to the insulation roll, so I am still
making that decision.  My original question was a source for the PANELS that
go over your head.  I'll be making mine out of 1/8&quot; hard board, but I wanted
a reference to get the dimensions of that orignal section.

 - Thanks

Kevin
