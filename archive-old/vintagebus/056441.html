Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

Read the article but didn't see the specifics on the bore sizes.  Maybe I
missed it.  I'll read it again.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what the bore size is on the single vs. dual MC's?  If
the
&gt; &gt; bore size is smaller (I doubt it) it may not be the &quot;upgrade&quot; it is
touted
&gt; &gt; to be.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Dan,
&gt; We wrote an article for the type2 library on this subject.  The 72 and
later
&gt; dual circuit MC has the same bore diameter as the 1955-67 MCs.  The only
&gt; change is a longer bore for the front disc brakes which required more CCs
of
&gt; brake fluid, which does not affect braking power in drum brakes.
