hi all,

Over lunch i did a bit of off roading to get to a good spot for lunching
in nature.

Problem is, i backed into a rock and dented my bus :(

I knew i should have put my bumper on sooner... oh well, it wasnt too bad,
i should be able to hammer it back out pretty easily, but there goes a
whole corner worth of nice OG paint :( (and you didnt think gangsters knew
bodywork)

*sigh* the bus does look pretty rough anyway, but i liked my nice straight
rear corners.

take care,

Steve
