  Well I'm at it again, getting ready to assemble my new engine, for those
that care here are the specs.
ah case
opened to 90.5
c/w and balanced 69 stroke crank
rebuilt stock rods balanced end to end
rebuilt single port heads, all new guides, Manley valves, 40 mm intake  35mm
exhaust, ports opened and smoothed
mahle 90.5 pistons, balanced and pin height matched
Eagle camshaft, custom grind  362 lift  236 duration, makes for good low
end. good to 4500 rpm
new VW cam followers
1.25 Autocraft ratio rockers
new high strength push rods
, 60 copper head gaskets
target compression ratio of 6.5-1
Genuine VW oil filter pump
34 pict 3 carb 169 mains and 65 air jet with late duel port intake and EMPI
single port end castings
  This is basically the same configuration as I had in the (now gone) famous
swap panel, I increased the valve size in the exhaust and ported the heads a
little more then before and went with a little longer duration cam, this
will be mated to a 3.88 r/p 77 4th gear Rancho trans with large nut rgb

wish me luck, hope to have it all in for the classic weekend cruise.
