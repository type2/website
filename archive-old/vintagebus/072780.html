I don't have it handy here at work, but the spec book talks about
these intakes. IIRC it was an m-code option for quite a while,
eventually just made standard for all busses making the trip
down-under. It's design apparently is more for clean air than cool
air. You guys with your dry dusty conditions apparently kept killing
engines :) this was used to hopefully keep dust &amp; dirt out of there. 

&gt; I'm not sure how cool the sir would be after

&gt; work but check it out.

I can't imagine it would get that much hotter. so any pics of how the
air is ducted to the engine?
