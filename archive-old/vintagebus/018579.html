Subject: Restoring dash handles?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just got three dash/partition handles out of a pair
of 66 busses. One is really nice, the other two have
the typical browning, and cracked end caps (these are
the vinyl ivory or silver-beige handles like in a
deluxe).

Has anyone had any degree of success bringing these
back to the original color?

Simple Green?
Soft Scrub?
Bleach?
NEW Soft Scrub(tm) with Bleach and lemon scent?
