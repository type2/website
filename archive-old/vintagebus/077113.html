&gt; &gt;It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each
&gt; state's classic plate
&gt; &gt;requirements to see what other states think and/or
&gt; use as their guideline
&gt; &gt;for classic car plates


In Wisconsin, collector plates are available for &quot;all
motor vehicles 20 years or older that have not been
altered or modified from the manufacturer's
specifications&quot;, to quote from the
brochure/application form.
Vehicles with collector registration may not be
operated during January, without obtaining a temporary
operation permit, $5 for 5 days or $30 for the month
of January.  You also must have at least one other
vehicle registered with regular plates.  There is a
limit of 500 pounds load hauled in truck type
vehicles, not including passengers, topper, etc., just
so you don't go out and license an old dump truck and
use it to haul gravel and avoid registration fees, I
guess.  These are all the restrictions that I am aware
of.
Modified vehicles, replicas, homemade vehicles, etc.,
can get &quot;Hobbyist&quot; registration.
In Wisconsin, there are two parts to the registration:
 your first automobile with collector registration
costs $140, and gives you your license number.  Any
subsequent vehicles are $90 for autos, and your next
one has &quot;A&quot; at the end of the number, the third one is
&quot;B&quot;, etc.  The plates are non-expiring.  As far as I
know, there is no provision to use original year
license plates. 
I think that antique registration is for older
vehicles (but I am not sure of the age) and limits you
to driving to, from and in parades and club events.
