&gt; I went to this site last night from someones message onlist, its a neat site
&gt; and worth a read, but it has plans for making a sandblasting unit that seem
&gt; simple cheap and looks like it would would work a treat. Save $'s bigtime
&gt; and do it yourself

I think  I heard it on the list, but not sure.  I've heard of people loosing
limbs from trying to make other things out of propane tanks just unscrewing the
tank valve.  I for one would be very careful with residual propane in the old
tanks.  The partially empty tanks hold fumes that are VERY explosive.  Only
takes one spark ya know.
