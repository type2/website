I have navigated through my unfortunate rash of blown
shifter couplers. Took heat from several local friends
over it. Makes for good camp fire stories~ now.

The last incident that comes to mind is the time that
Paula and I drove the '54 Barnambulator from Phoenix
to the 1999 VW Classic in Irvine, Ca. Along the way we
took a wrong exit in attempts to find Rich Yost's
place. We literally ended up on a dirt road on which
most folks would seriously lock the hubs and shift to
4wd low. VWFOOL_at_aol_dot_com was right behind us. It was
scarey to the point where I made Paula get out of the
bus in case it went &quot;over the edge&quot;. &lt;eek&gt; Bumped the
bottom of the bus on high center type obstacles and
had to back down a twisting 25 degree inclined dirt
road. Keep in mind that the barnambulator had no rear
window and the teeny round mirrors were less than
perfect.
We passed on Yost's gathering and rolled on toward the
Irvine Holiday Inn or whatever the new fancy name is.
Exited the 405, rush hour traffic, Friday afternoon,
LA California and BLAM! blew the coupler in the middle
of an intersection. In neutral!!!!!!
Thank God for Ralph's grocery store and the &quot;Hardware&quot;
aisle. Assorted package of band clamps held the
retainer bolt into the striped and broken hole. The
cheap coupler's threads were insufficient and the
metal portion to the rear of the bolt hole broke. I
suspected a combo of over torquing the bolt and
beating the couple on the ground during the 4X4
escapade. That band clamp held our chit together for
six months afterwards. Another barndoor type coupler
that separated into two front/back pieces was
eventually fixed &lt;via the kind efforts of Kyle
Tillman&gt; via three bolt/nut combos through both
pieces. Changed it in time to drive it a few times and
then ship it and the other 4X4 barndoor ambulance
camper poptop parts to Japan.
