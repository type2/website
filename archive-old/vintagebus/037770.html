&gt; can you tell anything about your bus from just the vin number?if yes than what.my vin number is 286049064
&gt; 
You can tell that it's a Microbus - 7-seater, 1966 model, # 49064 off the assembly line, built near the end of October, 1965.

286049064
28 = Microbus - 7-seater
6 = 1966 model
049064 = # 49064 off the assembly line, built near the end of October, 1965
