Subject: IMHO-cheap buses... and Friday buses 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In my honest opinion...

The last &quot;cheap&quot; bus that I got was out of Prescott AZ
negotiated literally at midnight in cash for $850.00
in 1996. A bargain at even that time and place. It was
about the straightest, driest bus that I have had the
pleasure to own. With that said, it had a
scrape/crease along the full length of the driver's
side. The '63 was to be a throw back/come down/reality
check from the three-four year ordeal of a complete
restoration of my wife's '67 Westy. 
Tangent: &lt;Apologies to the purist's sense of
restoration to include only OEM NOS parts.&gt; Every
single part on the bus was disassembled and reworked
excepting the speedo and the gas gauge. Would have
liked to have redone the speedo but didnt. So shoot
me...&gt; The Westy didn't see mile number one until all
systems were thoroughly gone through. We had taken
alot of local political hits for going to the extent
that we did in that (then) current environment.
Perception was verging on the pretentious level. 
Back from tangent:
This '63 was to be a rolling resto like I used to do.
I wanted to get back to the level at which I was
comfortable. I &quot;knew&quot; that I could do this one on the
cheap. I proceded to pour an estimated five or six
grand into it over three years of daily driving. Alas,
I spent literally EVERY weekend from Friday night to
Sunday evening for about two to three years doing and
redoing each system until it was right. Every time
that I tried to cut corners, I only cut my nose to
spite my face. Invariably, the cheap fix would
eventually get redone with appropriate parts or done
right with proper NEW seals or replacement parts. Tons
of local friends, especially Kyle Tillman, helped me
tremendiously on several occassions. Anyone who has
done this in either method knows how many hours of
labor (self, friends or paid mechanics) can be
involved!
Bottom line is that anyone who is shopping for a
$1000.-$2000. bus in today's market is shopping for a
base on which to build. I concur that the body should
be the key. Mechanical systems are easier to replace.
My personal favorites in todays markets are the bakery
panel bus which sold at BBBV, the '54 green and green
circus camper out of Seattle with the drop dead wood
work and the up coming killer camper being done by Dr.
Robert Davis which is going to kick EVERY one's a**es
this season upon completition. Given the money, I'd
drop by Drews or Lonnie's whoever has that Mango
standard on Everett's site and drive it away. Personal
opinion at this point and time.
My advice is to shop for a solid body in the variation
that pleases you. Forget the trends as they come and
go. What works for *you* is best. =) 

My &quot;Friday bus&quot; collection continues to diminish.
Now-a-days I only claim the wife's '67 and the Puck~
(not for sale).
Best wishes to everyone and good luck with whatever
turns YOUR crank. My daily has changed to something
else out of sheer economics and energy distribution.
