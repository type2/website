&gt; I am waiting on my new  stock 1600 dp.  I was wondering what dizzy and carb 
&gt; combination do you think that i should use?  My old 1500 has a 28 and an 
&gt; 009.  So i would not mind using the 009 especially considering that I put a 
&gt; electronic ignition in it.

I would recommend a 34 PICT-3 and a single-vacuum, dual-advance distributor. 
That's what I use, and I enjoy the response of a vacuum-advance distributor
with a centrifugal-advance curve similar to the 009.  The 34 out of the box
doesn't work very well with the 009 at all and needs to be re-jetted or, if you
care for a redneck fix, pop a rivet in the throttle plate hole and crrrrank up
that accelerator pump for black spark plugs and decent throttle response.

In case you couldn't tell, the redneck fix isn't something _I_ care for :-)

If you want to use your 009 and don't want to re-jet/redneck a 34, your best betis probably a 30 PICT-x carb with adapter.  If you can't keep a clean supply of
fuel to the carb for some reason, you may also want to go with the 30 as the
34 clogs easier and is more difficult to clean.  A clean fuel supply keeps me
running.

And of course there are myriad non-stock carb options but I've never been
down that road.
