Subject: swing axle daily driver

Ok folks. I know that many of you use your pre-67 vehicle as your daily
driver. My question is, how far is a round trip commute for you? I am
considering putting my '64 into commision for my driver, but my commute
is 65 miles round trip. Does that seem excesisive for a 35 (she was made

in 63) year old vehicle?
I don't know much about the swingaxle rear end vs the irs.
So I am looking for your experience in driving your swing-axle every
day.
Thank you.
