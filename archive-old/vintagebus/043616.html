&gt;I too have a problem with no hazards. The turn signals work but the
&gt;reverse lights only work on the right side.

The reverse lights don't have anything to do with the turn signals or
hazards.  They are on their own circuit...a hot wire from the coil
with inline fuse, a switch on the transmission, and the two bulbs.

&gt;Ive cleaned and inspected al connections and bulbs. The hazard switch on 
&gt;the dash has a gree? wire coing no where? 

Your hazard switch, if original, should have two wires: a blue one and
a brown one.  The blue one just makes the light in the knob blink on
and off with the hazards.  The brown one is grounded when the switch
is pulled out to start the 9-prong box doing its thing.

One test would be to find the 9-prong box and find the S- terminal,
which should come out the bottom with all the others and be the only
one with a brown wire on it.  *Carefully* jump a wire from ground
(bare metal on the body or connected to it...the metal nut that holds
the wiper switch would be good) to that terminal.  If that starts
your hazards working, the trouble is in the hazard switch or wiring.
If not, then the trouble could possibly be in the 9-prong box.

&gt;The stock radio is disconnected.

That shouldn't matter for this.

&gt;Should the blasck box be looked at now?

Maybe.  Check http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html
and run the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section in that document to see what's
what.

&gt;Shouldnt the indictor switch light up ?

Yes.  It should flash in time with the outside lights whenever the
hazards are on.

&gt;The Bentley manual that I currently have is not color coded.  My bus 
&gt;is a 67 Westy.

Go to http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html for color wiring
diagrams.  The page I mentioned above also has simplified color
schematics, showing just the brake/turn signal/hazard/9-prong box
wiring.

Good luck!
