Hi Adam,
Better get the Bentley reprint of the 63 on VW bus shop manual now.  While 
there is a slim chance the axle seal is bad, more than likely you have one or 
more of the RGB bearings going bad.  Either way you will need to not only 
know how to take it apart and put it back together, but how much to torque 
ALL the bolts properly.  Without this info you are really risking a crash and 
burn later when things suddenly come apart.  If it does not roll, steer, or 
brake properly things get out of hand quite quickly!
