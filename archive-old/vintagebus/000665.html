Subject: Re: [VB] Middle Seat Question...

Ive seen 63 have it both ways so Im guessing its a split year.
Early 63 might be found with a hard bar with a platic coated texture to it.
but it might have the plastic grab handle (the m &quot;mcdonalds&quot; one) with black 
ends I believe.
The floor and where the brackets are mounted tells the story as far as full 
or 2/3 seat size.
Ive seen walk throughs with either full or 2/3 seats.
Ive seen benches with full and 2/3s seats.
Take a look at where the mounting points (or lack of! If its rusty =)) are.
Hope this helps.

What kind of middle seat would a '63 deluxe have?

Metal Bar?  Plastic Bar?  Full-width or 3/4 width?
