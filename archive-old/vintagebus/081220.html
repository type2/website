X-RFC2646: Format=Flowed; Original
Subject: Toolkit for bus pickup trip.

I still don't have experience for this question, I just put the whole 
toolkit in the cargo bay, but if your trip carries you on I-5 through 
northern california, you are welcome to stop here for maintenance checks. If 
interested pmail for details.

John

&gt; So let's get to the point: What would you pack in your toolbox if it were 
&gt; YOU making this trip???
