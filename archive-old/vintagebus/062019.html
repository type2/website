&gt;Scott,
&gt;Nice pics we have interest in the &quot;third tail light&quot; can you give the
&gt;specifics - part, from who, where, wiring, all the good stuff. Look good

&gt; &gt; http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/vw/bultaco.html

Its a 3rd brake light from a Honda that I picked up at a local surplus 
supplies house for $19.
To wire it correctly, an extra wire needs to be run from the rear, up to 
the front and catch the power coming out of the brake switch.  If you pick 
up the power for the rear brake light at the brake light, it will also 
blink when indicating a turn in that direction.

The bracket was a set of L brackets made out of aluminum.  They were cut 
such that they matched the mounting holes for the light on top and the 
mounting holes for the license plate.

Care was also taken, not to pull the light in too close as it would block 
off the license plate light.

Scott
