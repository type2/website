At the OCTO show last year there was a man asking people if they would put
there bus in a Honda commercial, they went around and photographed all the
likely candidates, they took my DD picture but alas they didn't choose mine.

ronnie   old volks of az.

ps. a couple of weeks ago Yamaha jet ski people were looking for a split bus
with a hitch to use in a jet ski commerical they were filming in Havasu,
again they didn't pick my DD, no trailer hitch, keep your eyes open for this
one, a split launching 2 jet ski's.

That bus is owned by SV2s member Greg Frias. I've seen it a couple of 
times myself. I don't think the bumper stickers are his, though...
