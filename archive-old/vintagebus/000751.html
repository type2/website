Subject: [VB] value of '63 panel
Message-ID: &lt;0_dot_dee19c72.2572d250_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dear Listers,
I'm thinking of buying a '63 panel bus, double doors (both driver's and 
passenger side); I'd appreciate any input on this vehicles relative 
merits/scarcity/desirability/&amp;c. I haven't yet seen it--it's out of 
state--but its condition sounds decent. Needs a few things, but I guess the 
biggest factor is its state of rust? It now has a 1600cc engine with a new 
carb. Seat is full length. It has no headliner or interior panels. Any 
suggestions? Owner wants 1kilobuck, plus a couple hundred for the local 
mechanic's parts and time. I would have to drive it 800 miles home. . .Thanks!
