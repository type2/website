I don't have the patience for engines either - probably much less than you do.

That's why I buy my engines at the local flaps, with new cases, heads, etc.
then plug and play.

I may not be tearing it up in the 1/4 mile, but it's always running.  Which leaves
me more time and money for rust repair, paint and bodywork, and bolting little
doo-dads onto the car.
