Let me know when you want her.  I am off on Sundays and Tuesdays and am 
perfectly willing to help you get her home.  As for the Micro, the dizzy 
number is 
0-281-178-009  I don't know if the earlier numbers mean anything or not but 
there they are.  

Today I took the carb off the 66 to inspect her and found all the screws 
tight except two on the right hand side but they only needed a quarter turn.  
I even replaced the mounting seal and the seal on the second mount.  You 
know, the little platform the carb bolts to that bolts the carb to the throat 
thingy.  (I haven't mastered all the technical jargon yet)  When I went to 
tighten down the carb the front bolt stripped right out.  It stripped out of 
the carb itself so I couldn't even just replace that platform thingy.  Looks 
like I'll have to either re-tap the carb mount or just go shopping for a new 
one.  Fortunately I think my step-dad has a 30-Pict in his treasure chest so 
maybe I'll talk him out of it.  I'm kind of bummed about the carb stripping 
but maybe replacing it will solve some of the problems.  It was really dirty 
inside the bowl, lots of grime and oil from the looks of it.  I blasted it 
with carb cleaner while it was out and the black just stripped off the bowl 
like the mold stripped of my pop-top.  When I emptied the bowl there was a 
small chunk of something floating in the gas.  Unfortunately my reinstall 
turned a rebuild candidate into a parts pillage candidate.
