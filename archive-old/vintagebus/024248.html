Subject: New acquistion...


    Just got home with the usable stuff from the Carcass of a '59 Westy.

    It has been sitting up to the rockers in rotting apples for at least
20+ years with no front glass (from the partition forward was completely
rotted out, almost no frame left, transfer cases were seized solid,
etc.)...


    I can decipher most of the ID plate but there are a few things I'm
not clear on...

    As Follows:

    29 12 9


    372  B23  168  175  181  544

    UV  251 SK  654C    551426


    I get DOM being Dec 29, 1959

    SO-23 interior jives too

    168= 88Ah battery (6 volt)

    175= &quot;American&quot; bumpers

    181= Chrome hubcaps

    544=?

    UV= ?

    231= Kombi

    SK= ?

    654C= ?

Before anyone asks the majority of the interior is spoken for.... You'll
have to talk to M. Heron (aka Ben Pon) if you need something...

    I would have loved to restore this Bus, but it was WAY too far
gone...


    Any help would appreciated...
