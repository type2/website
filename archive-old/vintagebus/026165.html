Hi all,

Will a type 3 speedo fit into a type 2 dash?  In the junk yard I saw a
fastback, and a squareback both with speedos, and since the PO tried to
fit some Jetta guage in there, I was wondering if the type 3 speedo will
fit.  Yeah it isn't stock, but I want this one to be a driver.

Thanks,
Aaron
