Like I told Jason off-list.  If you're buying the pulley make sure you
buy 
both halves and the hub.

Man, this thread really took off. Thanks to everybody who chimed in. I
have at least 30 emails to go through and absorb. I plan to share them
with my mechanic and have him install a tach and oil pressure and
temperature gauges.

Thank you all,

SLO Jason
