Subject: More stock 65 Samba Q's (my restoration continues)

Can anyone help out here?  These are all for a stock 65 Samba
restoration i am working on.

1.  Did the middle and rear seat clamps have wing nut's or regular hex
nut's?

2.  Did the front and side door inner handle bezzles have a spring
behind them the take up the slack from the door handle post?  I have
room there but do not remember taking any springs out.  I know my 60
crew cab had them.

3.  Did the rear seat have the metal protector strip screwed to the
outer top edge along with the aluminum luggage bar or just the aluminum
bar?

4.  What do you all use to clean up original floor mat's?  Armorall?

5.  Anyone have a source for German Square weave grey S&amp;P carpet for the
rear cargo area besides Wolfsberg West?

6.  What do you all use for the carpet spacer under the carpet in the
cargo area in between the metal reinforcement rib's?  (To make the
carpet even back there)

7.  What direction did the inner door handles face?  Both front and
rear?  I think straight down for the rear and back for the front doors.
Theses are the long crome handles

Thanks again for the help.
