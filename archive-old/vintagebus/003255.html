&gt; does anyone have info good/bad re: woodstove in vw bus ?
&gt;
        Yes,
        There is a gentleman in our club who has owned his 61 bus since
1966.
He has had a woodburning stove in his bus for about 20 years.The whole damn
bus is a marvel of yankee engineering.Dual ice fishing holes in the floor
boards and I do mean boards ! Custom made heater boxes in which the exhaust
runs on the outside, and the heat collectors run on the inside( less heat
loss).Swivel
lawn seats in the cab, yes lawn chairs.Stackable cots in the rear with pot
and pan holders build in .Snowmobile pull start mounted to the crank
pulley,in case his battery runs down while ice fishing.
Safari style popout windows(hinged on top rather than side hinged).I could
go on and on for hours on the modifications he has done to his bus over the
decades.
    He likes to stay anonymous, so I won't mention his last name.But he is
the Huber beer fan and fisherman seen in the xmas cards sent in to
HotVws.His hilarious cards are featured every year !! You guys who go to
Buses By The Arch I'm sure have checked out his bus.The bus is called the
&quot;Blue Bomber&quot;.
    At VWoA in Michigan, there were hordes around his bus all day, which
really pisses off the 23 window crowd !!!!   Us campers love this man and
his bus !!
    A few years ago he was run off the road by a redneck in a pick up truck
which resulted in him fliping his bus in the ditch.Luckily he was unhurt !!
But his bus we thought was a total loss.Hell No, John used 15 gallons of
bondo to &quot;patch&quot; the drivers side panel.That side of the bus now has no
curve to the panel ,instead it is square like a true box on wheels.John
resides in the north woods of Wisconsin.
He is one of the most interesting bus people I've ever met,and thats saying
alot since bus people are the coolest ! If your ever in the area stop in on
a dbg event and your likely to have a chance to meet a true legend in our
own minds.

            is it good or bad to install a wood burning stove in your bus?
Well, it's not my first choice for a heat source. And definetly NOT the
safest !
But it works for John, and his windows never fog or ice up.
