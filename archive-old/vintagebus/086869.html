Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] wtb: Westfalia mattress foam

I had to replace some foam in my bed seat. Used what was described as medium 
density. Feels about the same as the original. BTW the original foam seems 
to be about as good as the day it was installed 43 years ago as long as it 
has its coverings. I had some holes in the naugahyde and there was 
deterioration in those spots.
