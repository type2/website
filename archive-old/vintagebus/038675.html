hi all,
i have a question. now that i've gotten my so42 campbox installed and spent
some time in it, i've been looking at pics of other westfalias. my rear
facing bench cushion is divided into two. most that i have seen are just one
piece. in fact, i think just about all of them have been. is the split
cushion setup a rarity? it is pretty cool. i was just wondering. i will try
to have pics soon.
