Fortunately I did include those instructions on a packing slip that went out with the slats.  I'd hate to be cursed years down the road as &quot;the guy who aided in rusting out my floorpans.&quot;

Actually, based on information I have, the factory used a *sealing strip/tape* to seal the holes when using screws.  They didn't use any type of sealer when attaching the slats with pop rivets.
