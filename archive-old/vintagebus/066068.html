&gt; Richard has decided to continue on to Grand Junction and to John Jones

&gt; it there. If he does break completely before arriving, John will go tow him
&gt; in.

&gt; If anybody reads this and hears from Richard, please relay this message

.... Sorry I am 4-5 hours away from Moab in Salt Lake City.  If there's
anything I can do for Richard from SLC, have him call _at_ 801-599-5798-cell or
521-3335 days.

We've got to stop having bus folks break down in Utah.  We've already got a
strange reputation here anyway &amp; being part of the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; is not
helping!
