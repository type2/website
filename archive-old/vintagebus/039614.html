What is the best method of repainting the VW enblem onto the hubcaps ( this 
is a commercial vehicle with painted hubcaps- I matched the color of the 
hubcaps to the interior grey/primer and I now want to paint-in the VW emblem 
on the hubcap using L257 to match the front emblem and the bumpers).
Do I try to free-hand it or mask it off and spray it?
