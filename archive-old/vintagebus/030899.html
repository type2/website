Subject: hursts and CIS

First off, thanks to the people who replied to my questions on the 
hursts.  I got some good replies and learned a bit more about the 
originals.  It seems that there are a few things that he &quot;improved&quot; 
upon, so they are not exact copies.

Anyways, i know a few of you out there have put FI into your buses, or 
know some about FI.  If anyone is familiar with the CIS system would you 
please p-mail me?  Pretty please?  I have a few questions (not regarding 
how to put it in a bus or anything like that)

Thanks!
Isaiah
