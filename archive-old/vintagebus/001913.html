I finally got new tires for Geraldene last week,  195 75R14 Nankang Radials.
MAN!  what an improvement.  She is  easier to steer in tight quarters, that
boat like wallow in corners is gone, and now when a tractor trailer blows by
me at 90 I don't get blown of the road!  They do have a very truck like look
to them, not like army jeep tires or any think like that, although I think
those would look cool on a bus too.  I shall keep everyone posted on the
endurance run.
