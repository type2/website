&lt;&lt; How difficult would it be for me to fix this  myself? Before I get into 
this I'd appreciate any feedback anyone can offer. It is driving me crazy.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Greg,
You can do it!  You just need to remove the gearshift for a good cleaning and 
greasing.  Then make sure you have a reverse lock out plate under the shifter 
and properly positioned (Sticking up and on the right if we remember 
correctly.).  You may need a helper to get the shifter rebolted back in.  The 
main thing that is a bit of a mind bender is when you adjust the base of the 
shifter to get the shift pattern in it's proper place.  If you need the 
shifter to go forward more to engage first you have to move the base of the 
shifter to the rear.  If you feel you need more movement to the right then 
you move the base of the shifter to the left.  This is due to the shift 
linkage moving opposite under the floor in relation to the top of the gear 
shift.  Eric&amp;Barb
