Dear Folks,

Here is a message I just sent to the Bus Tour Drivers list and to the
Friends of the Bus Tour list. I hope this is of general interest and that it
doesn't annoy the list gods.

I've just gotten through setting up the Archives portion of the new Bus Tour
web page at http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff/Archives.htm . As you will see as
you check it out, there is still a great deal of work to be done in
rebuilding these entries. Chris Slaymaker was kind enough to give me
permission to use his trip report which appeared on Leo Soderman's web page
and I have put it up on the new page as a prototype. Chris's Trip Report can
be viewed by clicking on the &quot;Trip Reports 1999&quot; link in the body of the
text on the new Archives page.

If your trip report appeared on Leo's page and you'd like it included on the
new web page, please e-mail me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net giving me
permission to do so and I will put it up there!

If you have driven and your report never made it to Leo's page, you can type
up a new one or you can fill out our handy-dandy Trip Report Form which is
also located on the new Archives web page and e-mail that to me too  along
with any photos you may have and I'll put that up too.

I you happen to talk to or see John Anderson, PLEASE, PLEASE ask him to
e-mail me so we can get the Hubcap back in motion.

Thank you for your continued help and support!

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
