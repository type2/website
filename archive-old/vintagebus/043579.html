&gt;I am having brake woes with my 65 westy.  pulls to left.

About the only part you haven't checked or replaced is the return
springs.  These would probably tend to cause dragging after you
release the brake pedal, but they might be involved.  One of the
springs in the front of my Dad's '74 Bug broke, so he replaced
them all and I think he said the brakes felt better - I'll check
with him to see if he noticed any other symptoms.

If you have it all apart or take it apart again you could try
swapping the springs side-to-side and see if it pulls to the
right then.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
