Subject: westy wood-triangle reflectors
To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Westy wood Southern California source:

Peterman Lumber Co.
15492 Slover
Fontana, CA  92335
Citrus South to Slover and then onto Elm...
(909)357-7730

5'x5'x1/8&quot; real White Baltic Birch
excellent pricing.
Difference between this and Lenny Coop's is the tons
of labor and potential mistakes/wasted material. 

Eriba Puck triangle reflectors:
OG was aluminum backed, common replacement might be
black plastic backed.

Triangle is a common shape of reflector in Europe.
Down load &quot;Copernic&quot; search engine then search for 
GEKA as name brand. Part # Roman numeral III E1 in a
small circle and then- 0113491 R3
other type on reflector &quot;III e1 13491

I might be an occassional smart a** on a feisty Friday
but I do have some knowledge/sources. Hope to help
everyone with their hobby. =)
