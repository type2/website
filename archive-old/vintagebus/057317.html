Subject: NOS round bus side mirror

No-one responded to my last Q.  There has got to be
someone out there who has seen or may have a NOS side
mirror.  I would like to know what the finish on the
back side of the housing looks like.  Is it polished
aluminum like i think or something else?  

How do you tell a good quality Repro from a NOS one
besides the loose mount stud, missing #'s on the back
ring, box that says china, etc.

ANYONE????

thanks
Matthew
