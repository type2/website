Yep, HARD TO FIND.
I have seen the 59-67 style ones fetch 75-150$ at shows and ALWAYS sell 
before 9A.M.
I wouldnt be surprised seeing values of this piece go through the roof.
My 57 was 100% complete bus less this piece, I will admit paying DOUBLE the 
price of the 59-67 ones sell for......who knows, I might have paid more, I 
think the seller wanted more, but, but, I think he was satisfied raping me 
for what he did.
But, it was nice, it was green, and I felt good snapping it in between the 
legs of that thing....and now I dont need to hunt anymore.
It was also rare enough to track the history of the panel and find its SEVEN 
PREVIOUS OWNERS.
Like as if it had a serial number or something?
I even have a photo of it laying in a stack of parts for sale FIFTEEN YEARS 
AGO!!

&lt;&lt; I am with Todd on this one.I had a complete S&amp;P interior fresh from a long

ago wrecked 67 installed in my 66 and when I had the bus for sale people

wanted to buy just this panel for crazy money.If I still had this bus I

could have parted the interior and financed the resto  of my singlecab and

this was before the real insanity started.This is also a part NEEDED to

properly finish off a resto unlike an ambo fan or safaris(per Mcodes of

course).
