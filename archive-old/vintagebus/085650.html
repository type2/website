Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

OK - well - I'm planning on a 1641 sp - out of a 1500 or 1600 - I planning 
on running my current tranny and redux boxes (not sure what year but small 
nut for sure).  I might plan on a fwy flier eventually - but I want to see 
how it runs with the original tranny (or period tranny) and the 1641 - I'm 
guessing slow but not as loud as the 40 hp ... anyway - I want to start 
gathering up tin - can you advise my as to what I need?

My bus is a pretty much stock 60. I don't want to change redux boxes as I 
have a spare set and I like the idea of the cheapish bearings in the small 
nut boxes.

TIA

&gt; Hi John,
&gt; Somewhat depends on how you built the engine.  With enough $$$ and 
&gt; madness
&gt; you could build one out of a 25 or 36 HP engine case...
&gt;  If you used a 40 HP bored for the larger cylinders,  or 1300, or 1500, or
&gt; 1600 engine case.  You can use the engine  tin from each of the three 
&gt; latter
&gt; sizes of engines, or a mixture of  such.  Though dog house shroud, fan, 
&gt; and tin
&gt; are a must for 40 HP and  later engines in our opinion.
