Subject: oil filler neck never tight

hey kids,
here's the deal, my oil filler neck never stays put. i
don't think it was tightened down enough the first
time it was put on so oil got in and coated the
threads. now it comes off about every month. i can
tell every time it comes off because my compression
goes to sh*t. what would cause this? do i have to
tighten up my generator tie-down to keep the generator
stand  from jiggling so much? or is there a lock
washer that is supposed to go in there? another issue.
has anyone found a good tool to tighten down the
fastener for the oil filler neck? the best thing i've
found is a 1 1/2&quot; wide paint scraper, but there has to
be something better than that. thanks again for all
your help.
