I work at a large software company where everyone has super expensive 
performance cars. They wouldn't dream of being caught dead in a split window 
bus. I love vintage Volkswagens and I always share my enthusiasm with my 
coworkers. They tease me alot for it and they always ask me how I can like 
such &quot;crappy cars&quot;. Of course this gets me going and a lengthy debate always 
insues. Well, today I was successful in getting them to shut their mouths 
long enough for me to FORCE them to look at Thom's site. When all was said 
and done I got them to admit, out loud, that buses aren't as bad as they 
previously thought. One guy even said &quot;I might have to get me one of those&quot;. 
I doubt he ever will, but I least I got to share something I love with my 
coworkers and hopefully I've opened their eyes just a little bit.

Volkswagen Ambassador,

Jason
