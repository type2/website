&lt;&lt; Met a few listees, but didn't meet all that were there.

Saw a smooth gate singlecab with a HUGE center-above-the-cab light

that needed serious left rear metal work.  Love the smooth gate

trucks.  I'd love to rescue that truck from the current owner.

Its fake. Its a 54 singlecab.
Cool to see smooth gates on it!
