&gt;Costco's LT 195/75/14 tires under the
&gt;Kirkland label.  They are made by Michelin and are the same tire (I
&gt;think?) as the Michelin LTX tires.  They have a 60,000 mile warrenty.
&gt;To buy these tires you must join Costco, $40, and I paid $49 per tire
&gt;plus all of the extras costs...  The final cost was less than what I
&gt;would have had to pay for the Yokohama Y365s, including the Costco
&gt;membership.

I'd check. I think Tire Rack carries the Yok for around $53 and there is
this installation network thing they have but I don't know how much it
costs to have them installed/balanced locally. Call Tire Rack and ask.
(This paragraph may be confusing unless you understand that Tire Rack is a
mail-order tire outfit.)

I'd also search the archives for &quot;michelin AND tread AND separation&quot; (or
various misspelled permutations) and see if there were results that raised
my eyebrows. Hint: DO THIS before you go spending $300.

&lt;Caustic remark about the industrial acumen/work ethic of the French
witheld in the interests of world peace&gt;

Another problem that's getting pretty serious is that nobody but nobody can
balance wide fives anymore. Hoover has an article on bubble-balancing here:

and you might have to do that.

I cannot believe I am prolonging a tire thread,
