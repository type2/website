Subject: oil cooler leaks
Message-ID: &lt;3754515E.B457F801_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Well, I finally set aside some time today and worked on the bus.  I
wrote a couple weeks back about my oil leak from my engine.  There is a
leak from the left side of the engine between the fan housing and the
cylinder tin.  I have a new oil cooler and seals on the way but I
decided to check the oil pressure relief valve.  I unscrewed the plug
and out came the spring and a good stream of oil.  A couple of seconds
later, the plunger fell.  Hmmm, that was funny.  I cleaned the spring,
plunger, and the plug.  I shined a light up the hole and it looked real
clean, almost too clean.  I still cleaned it with a toothbrush and a
rag.  I replaced it all and started it up.  Oil started immediately
leaking from the same spot as the original oil leak.  Now, if my
calculations are correct, it should be several minutes before the oil
leaks since it is still cold.  I run 10W-30 oil right now.  Maybe the
oil I am using is too thin.  I am real curious to see what happens when
I pull the engine next weekend!  Thanks for the time.
