Well, summer has almost slipped by us once again...

That means it is time for Peach State Transporters &quot;End of Summer
Campout&quot; at Duckett Mill Campground on Lake Lanier, just outside
Gainesville, GA.  All VW bus owners and enthusiasts and their
families are invited to attend.

Duckett Mill is a great Corp of Engineers campground on Lake Lanier.
The campground reaches out like fingers onto the lake and there is
easy access to the lake from almost every campsite.

*Saturday night I will grill burgers and hotdogs for everyone
*Sunday morning I will cook breakfast (bacon, eggs, &amp; pancakes) for
everyone.

Directions from Atlanta:
Take 400 north to Exit 17, turn right on Hwy 306, turn right on Hwy 53,
turn right on Duckett Mill Rd. which ends at the campground.

The telephone # for Duckett Mill is (770) 532-9802.  Additional info
on camping at Lake Lanier can be found at:

Some people will be going Friday night, but I will not be there until
Saturday morning.  Hope to see you all there!
