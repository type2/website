We are going to get kicked and rightfully so for contiuing this thread. Sure 
it is kind of iinterseting. Sort of.

But not as interesting as finding out that the rear hatch seal made in 
mexico is really confusing. I had a hard time figuring out which way the 
seal went, and when I did (i think) it kind of sucked. Or maybe it doesnt 
but it just makes no sense to me. Its like a silly rubber band that fits 
many ways,, but no way is it perfect. Order german, even if it costs more.
