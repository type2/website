&gt; I got a very good deal on a early bay and I'm wondering if I could use the 
&gt; front axle (with disc) on my '63 split?  I think I have heard that the 
&gt; early bay front axle will lift the split front ?

Hi Lars,
It will, but unless you install a way to drop the front end, it will raise 
the front of the bus about 2&quot;.  You also need to install the pressure 
regulator in the line going to the rear brakes or risk having them lock up 
well before the front brakes, and having your bus do 180+ degree spins on 
even dry pavement when panic braking.  Best also to use 73 and later disc 
brake parts due to being made for more years, better designed and more 
availible than the earlier disc.
