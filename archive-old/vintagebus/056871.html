&gt; What is involved in separating the RGB from the axle tube?  I understand 
&gt; that I must remove the pin but what kind of force is needed after the pin 
&gt; is out?  Also, do I need special tools?

Hi Elliot,
Take a look at section H-5, page 2 in the Workshop Manual Volkswagen 
Transporter 1963-67 for this info and pictures which are worth a thousand 
words each!
