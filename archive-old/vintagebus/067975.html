Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch Part numbers

Do not base your search on part numbers.Suppliers have a habit of
superceeding
and combining parts under a common number.Take the part to a compentent
parts
house and show them what you need,this gets you the right part more than
if you
go by the numbers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I have to so disagree with this WRT vws. If I have a VW PN I have rarely
gotten a wrong part. When I have relied on standard FLAPS cross references
I have often gotten an incorrect part.
