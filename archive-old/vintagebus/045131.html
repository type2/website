&lt;&lt; Part number is 131 721 551.  It is interesting that we had to shorten this 
about  7mm from it's 603mm length to fit properly in our 60 panel &gt;&gt;

Hi Clara,
This is the part we bought and cut recently and is currently availble.  It is 
also the longest one we could find at Bow Wow.
  Forgot to mention earlier that this sheeth has made the gas pedal better 
both through increased feed back feel, easier to work and the accelerator 
cable end was always a bit too long.  To the point that the barrel clamp 
locked down just forward of the swedged cable end.  Now the barrel clamp 
locks right on the mid portion of the swedged cable end.

 &lt;&lt;and the original part 111 721 551 is listed as &quot;Protective tube - 
Accelerator cable (shorten to 670 mm)&quot;. &gt;&gt;

This above is the part listed in the bus 1963-67ish parts manual.  Why they 
say to cut it to 670 mm is beyond us!
