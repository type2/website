I was thinking about the compatability issue when I took it out last night.
Used a Bosch blue coil, so maybe that was a problem. They should warn you
about that though if that is the case. Fortunately, my PITA exercise
occurred in the garage, but I usually carried the &quot;old&quot; points with me in
the repair bag.

Thanks for the advice on the Compufire as this may be my next step

Scott

PS: Westy that burned out completely...... Couple in their 30's from NY
state survived with minor injuries.
