I emailed the guy the first time it was on ebay 2/3 weeks ago and asked
him questions and more photo's,He did not answer any questions and just
gave me 2 more photo's. one of the dash looking in from driver's side
door open.(has a deluxe dash w/about 100 extra holes!) and the second
from the rear end looking from the drivers side corner from a 10 feet
away.I wish I still had them to Share,but I don't not want to get sick
again so I deleted them.UNLESS YOU ARE REAL BRAVE,this bus is
F*CKED.Anything from eastern germany is your first CLUE,Forget it!They
did not have access to parts in eastern germany to fix cars correctly so
they used whatever would work....I.E. the kitchen sink,the out house
door...what ever. Get my drift???
            I have a MUCH BETTER bus for sale. A 53 Panel at $8500 a
rust free driver,with some small euro modifications

Mark
