Subject: Re: [VB] Painters, ever experiance this?
  =?ISO-8859-1?B?oChQYWludCB0cm91YmxlIG9uIERDKQ==?=

sounds like a temperaure problem to me, either paint was cold, ambient, or the subject being painted was too cold...or colder/warmer than paint, etc..

this is if the paint was mixed right, surface was prepared properly, air pressure was right, painter has skill, etc.
