Subject: RE: [T2] UPDATE - Buses By The Depot (this Saturday)

&gt; I'll be at the Buses By The Depot this Saturday and was
&gt; wondering if anyone was bringing small kids. I'm most likely
&gt; coming alone but I know my wife would love for me to bring
&gt; our 2 1/2 year old daughter so she can have a break. I'd be
&gt; curios to know if there would be any other kids there.


I'm bringing my 8 year old daugher (at least part of the time).  It's in a
public park, and there's a large playground directly in front of the camping
area. If the weather's good there will certainly be other kids playing
there, whether they're with the BBD crowd or not, so you can always wander
over there if she gets bored.
