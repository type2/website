No need to remove the engine...I had this happen to me last summer on one of
the longer work days of the summer.

Just don't be as stupid as me and cut the wrong cable while trying to remove
the old one. I got mine in with out a problem, just put a little lube on the
cable, and it should slide in pretty easily. 

Actually I remember my cousin helping me get it in the last foot or so, as
there is a bend in the cable tube theat needs to be kind of pushed straighter
to get the cable through

good luck
