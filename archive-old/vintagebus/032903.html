I dunno why you guys whine about the wives.  Men tend to have a real low 
tolerance for a woman with greasy hands and jeans,  and dislike me boiling 
engine parts in the kitchen, washing my greasy hands there and complain about 
me bogarting the garage.   Like I could park my old bus with no paint out in 
the rain.  As if! and why are these old VWs taking up all the places to park?
