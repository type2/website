and I have to write once again on the subject. I happened to be looking for
another car after the lease on my F**d expired and was exploring the
possibilities. I walked into a BMW dealer and just wanted to ask some
questions when actually the question came from a salesman, &quot;Are you sure you
can afford this?&quot;, well I left this place and went to another dealer which
in turn gave me a car for a test drive for a day!! I was test driving a car
a whole day, home, work, shopping, errands.......Believe it! Next day I took
home a Bimmer and guess what I did first, I went to the first one just to
prove to him how much money he just lost by pissing me off like that. You
should of seen his red face, I don't think he liked that very much.

Just my two cents on the un Bussy subject.

Later,

&gt; &gt; But it certainly wasnt the worse car buying experience. When years later
&gt; &gt; I was looking for a small pickup, I wandered in a Dodge dealership where
&gt; &gt; they were asking for a $50 deposit for a test drive!!! I couldnt believe
&gt; &gt; it when they asked the dooood in front of me for it. When he walked, I
&gt; &gt; stood there open mouthed while he explained to the young trainee that
&gt; &gt; &quot;if they dont wanna leave the deposit, they arent serious&quot;. Here I was
&gt; &gt; standing there, so serious that I intended on leaving there that night
&gt; &gt; with a truck. I went down the street to the Nissan dealership and drove
&gt; &gt; home a new truck home that night.
&gt;
&gt; Too bad you didn't take your new Nissan by the Dodge dealer to show them
&gt; how serious you weren't!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; But even worse was when I accompanied a female friend of mine to a Mazda
&gt; &gt; dealership when she wanted to buy a small pickup and the salesman said,
&gt; &gt; and I am not kidding. . .&quot;if you wanna buy a truck, come back with your
&gt; &gt; husband&quot;!!! Now I know that was grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Seems like the dealerships like to hire idiots.
&gt;
&gt; I have firsthand knowledge of that.  My idiot neighbor of the last two
&gt; years has had jobs selling Dodge, Jeep, Toyota, moble homes, and
&gt; Cadillacs, all at different dealers. He drives
&gt; home the demo cars of whichever tin he is pushing at the time, with the
&gt; exception of the mobile homes, of course!  :)
&gt;
&gt; This neighbor isn't so fond
&gt; of me because I don't buy new cars and I help my neighbors keep their
&gt; oldies running.  He figures I'm taking bread out of his mouth.
