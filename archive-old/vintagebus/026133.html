Gee Todd,

Didn't intend on offending you.  Ask 2 grand if you want....they're your
windows.  I was just surprised at the amount original safaris are now
bringing.

BTW the weld ons that came with the original set I have are NOS.  Does that
mean my windows are &quot;mainly NOS&quot;  or just &quot;partly kinda sorta almost NOS&quot;?
Sounds like something you'd see on Ebay ;-)

&gt;
&gt; See, I WANT to keep them for my other bus, thus the
&gt; price, make sense?  Where am I gonnna find another set
&gt; of all original VW safaris in this condition??  It is
&gt; near impossible.
&gt;
&gt; If the price seems high...just wait until you decide
&gt; to restore yours! ;-)
