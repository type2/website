Here is the rough estimate I received for extracting that single cab in that
yard.

I guess it was worth a try...

Dear Thom:

A ballpark estimate would be $3000.00 minimum and that's without us looking
at the site.  The additional costs would be if other cars are on top of the
one you need moved and other objects in the flight path.

Also a 300 feet diameter area under the helicopter must be void of all
persons as the helicopter moves with the car.  The lift weight limit is 3000
lbs.

FAA would also have to approve the lift.

Sincerely,

Jay Koch

&gt;
&gt;Hi.  I'm trying to find a ballpark estimate to perform a &quot;rescue&quot; operation
&gt;for a car.  It's in a yard in ##########, but with a combination of
terrain,
&gt;and the junk that's been stacked in front of it over the years, access with
&gt;a truck appears to be close to impossible.  In addition, it was stacked on
&gt;some other vehicles with a crane.
&gt;
&gt;What I would need is to have the vehicle (which doesn't have an engine or
&gt;transmission right now) lifted out and set down where we could load it onto
&gt;a conventional trailer, a couple hundred yards away.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your time.
