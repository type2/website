just a huge thanks to all who have replied. I haven't figured this out yet 
but I'm getting some help from someone online with the jetting of the carb 
itself.

As far as fuel pressure goes I did replace the plastic base under the fuel 
pump a while back and distinctly remember it being like 1/8th in. thinner 
than the old base but taking into consideration that the cam would still 
travel the same distance I dismissed my concern. Did I go wrong? The bus 
does run and idle fine. It is not flooding which would seem to be the result 
if the pressure was too high. Am I missing something simple? Please tell me 
if I am.

Thanks again for all the help I'll keep you posted,

If anyone is interested here are the current jets,

Pri. Air = 165
Sec. Air =160

Pri. Main = 137
Sec. Main = 140

Pri. Idle = 60
Sec. Idle = 50

yes these are the way they are and were in my carb. It's a weber 32/36 
progressive. Any ideas or brainstorms?

Scott
