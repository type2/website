It's real simple,  your in business and if you want to stay in business then
you have to care about your reputation in the community.  The golden rule is
&quot;The customer is always right&quot;.  There is not two sides to the story, either
the customer is happy or their not.  As a business person it's your
responsibility to make the customer happy and make the transaction positive,
then they will come back and maybe tell others.  It's that easy.  And as you
can see a bad rap travels very fast and becomes hard to clean up.  It's a
small world.
