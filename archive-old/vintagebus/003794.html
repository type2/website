&gt; That's good info.  I'd like to throw in something about hard bolts if I
could.
&gt;  I don't know what grade bolts came off of the RGB's - there are those
with
&gt; much more knowledge of the specifics of busses out there and presently I
don't
&gt; have access to my bus to check it out - but someone replacing those bolts
&gt; should go with the same exact hardness.

Just happen to have a few from a 66....
They have Kamax  10K on the head. Rounding down would be a 9.8 but these are
not that easy to find. Rounding up would be 10.9,  this strength is a more
common readily accessible bolt.
