It's definitely not the originals.... what month was the deluxe built as on
May 19, they switched from the 36 hp and split case transaxle to the bastard
40 hp and tunnel transaxle.

&gt;&gt;I'm trying to figure out what engine and tranny combo are in my 1959
deluxe
I just purchased. The engine is stamped H5244465 and the tranny is stamped
H5790444. What book or manual would have this info? Would someone on the
list look them up for me?
