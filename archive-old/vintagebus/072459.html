Subject: stuck drum update

hi, thanks for all the suggestions. It's not a running bus so I guess I
can't try driving with the nut backed off. I called sears, auto zone, and
harbor freight and they all claimed not to have any drum pullers. At one
auto zone the guy suggested taking the bus to a place that does free
brake checks and let them wrestle with it, hehehe : )  I saw a brake drum
puller with 3 arms on the eastwood website, it looks o.k. and cost about
$45. If nothing else turns up I might try that. I am not sure if it's
heavy duty enough or not though. For the last week or so I've sprayed PB
blaster on it and tapped it with a hammer so hopefully that's helping.
thanks again for all the advice! Chris
