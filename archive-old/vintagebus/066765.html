Subject: Re: [VB] 40hp heads

Thanks for the generous offer, but I am going to hold out for a 113 101 371F (or
a pair of 113 101 373 no suffixes if those come along first). I'm not in a
hurry, I wouldn't be building a 40hp motor if I were... As far as I can tell
these are the only two 40hp heads with original short rocker arm studs, and to
me that is worth having.
Localish VW dismantler says they sell &quot;gauranteed rebuildable&quot; heads for $35 a
piece. Funny gaurantee.

&gt; I have a matched set of 371As that appear to have never been mounted, but
&gt; were stored poorly before I got them. I got them as part of a package trade
&gt; deal, but I will never use them - they are yours for the asking, if you can
&gt; use them. Let me know - I am in NorCal.
