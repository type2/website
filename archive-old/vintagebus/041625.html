&gt; I want to install a clock I bought at the Red Barn and while I am doing that, 
&gt; I want to replace the burned out instrument panel lights.
&gt; I took out the screws holding in the black panel and the cover is still 
&gt; attached by the heater control knobs (the blue &amp; red knobs). How do you 
&gt; remove these to get to replace the instrument cluster lights?

The levers slide into channels behind the panel and are held by plastic
rivets.  If you remove the plastic rivets the levers can be pulled out.
They are also held by springy shims, so it takes some force to pull them
out.

When reassembling, note that the springy shims have a hook so that they
can hang from the channel.  Line the tab of the lever up with the channel
and slide it in.  I did not replace the plastic rivets in mine, as the
springy shim holds things in place nicely and leaving out the rivets makes
the next disassembly easier.
