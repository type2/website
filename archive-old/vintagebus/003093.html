Subject: [VB] What-Not cabinet
Date: Sun, 12 Mar 2000 21:07:12 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have three questions about the What-Not cabinet in my SO-42 Westy (the
&quot;shelf&quot; that hangs on the rear cargo door).  First, what kind of wood is it
made out of?  I know the interior panels are made of baltic-birch plywood,
is the shelf made out of the same thing?  Couldn't find out in the archives
or library.

Next, can somebody point me to a picture of the back side of the shelf
(attachment point to the cargo door bracket)?  That part of mine is
broken/missing.  The PO (a professional woodworker) and I are going to
attempt to repair my shelf.

Finally, would there be any interest in reproducing these shelves?  I
understand that the prices for originals can be rather exorbitant.  As
mentioned above, the PO is a pro.  I work with him and he is very skilled,
and has more tools than I thought possible for one man :-)  He loves the
busses (owns several) and I think he would dig the idea, time permitting.
Any thoughts on this?  Just mulling it over.
