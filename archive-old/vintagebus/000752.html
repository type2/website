&lt;&lt; I guess I was too busy fondling my pretty new Bentley and forsake the

 folkwisdow of the idiot guide. I also have to agree with you that Neil is
 prolly right. I have a bad habit of overdoing it in my head before I pick up
 a wrench:) I ran through the Muir front end chapter and have a clearer
 understanding of the whole shabang. I am worried that my '67 has those king
 and link pin thingys that Muir said were dropped in '65:) Oh well......
 
  &gt;&gt;
the type II used king / link pins through 67.   The bugs dropped them 
earlier.   Thopugh a useful book, he can be a bit vague sometimes, remember 
most people buying the muir book have bugs, and he probably h ad bugs in his 
head if he didn't specify he was not talking about buses in that line.
