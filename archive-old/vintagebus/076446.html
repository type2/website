Subject: web site back up...

Hi All,

 

Thanks for all your suggestions yesterday regarding my need to move my
site and find cheaper hosting.

 

I found it and even registered my own domain name instead of being a sub
directory off of my business web.

Actually, this is the best just in case the big bad corporate world
forces me out of business (long story which a few of you know).

 

I still need to edit a few things like the home page but I'm off to
lunch at the moment.

 

 

Enjoy, and please let me know if there are any issues with the new site.

 

 

 

David Mayes
