Subject: Project Judson Supercharger...Over

Well,

The test is over.  I had installed my Judson Supercharger in my Bug last
weekend.  I took it out today.  I had wanted to see if it would work
well on my stock 40HP motor.  In the end, i decided that it is a neet
thing to have, if it is on a non daily driver car.

My findings:

1.  Without all the right parts, it is a bit dificult to use.  I did not
have the right throtle linkage and my carb liked to stick open. (still
do not know what the right one look's like).  Also, without the blower
bracket, the whole unit flex's and hit's the engine deck lid.  I did
aquire a new bracket today, but...
2.  Gas milage wend down.  It went from about 22mpg to 17mpg.  For a car
i drive every day to work, i did not want to use more (higher octain)
gas
3.  You go through the Marvel Mystery Oil like it was candy.  A full jar
per tank of gas.  The stuff is also messy to poor into the bottle
through the oiler top.
4.  The unit was having trouble starting the last few day's.  This may
be from some other factor's but i tend to think it is not.  Once i took
it off, the car started right up.
5.  Was getting alot of pinging when the motor was cold.  I know the
timing was set right.  It would also ping under load when i really got
on it. (if you can &quot;Realy get on&quot; a 40HP motor)

In all, i liked the extra power (wow, 55 HP), but it will be a toy i
will put on for show's.  As for now, i have boxed it up in two set's
ready to install when needed.  To those who want to put one on there
car, give it a go and let me know what you find out.  Maybe i had
something done wrong.  I do not think so, but it would not be the first
time.

BTW, i left the 010 Dizzy on.  It works very well.

Matthew
