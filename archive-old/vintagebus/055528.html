Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser Plugged SP conversion

Here is the trick...
Drill 2 (about 9mm)holes....At the point where the heat riser tube makes
it's sharp bend, under the manifold, do this in a manner where you are
creating a straight shot through the blocked riser tube.....

Find a welding rod (1/8&quot;) and strip all the shielding from it
bend a small area in it, almost like a hook. chuck it intal a drill, and
insert into the blocked area...Ream the heck out of it and keep soaking it
with spray carburetor cleaner..

After you are done, weld the 2 holes back up and you are done..

This is the best method I have found to get all the crud out.....Using the
proper heat riser gaskets, which are really hard to find does the job and
keeps the heat riser flow going only one direction, keeping this from
happening......

Subject: [T2] Heat riser Plugged SP conversion


&gt; Will there be a day I do not have to post to these lists???
&gt;
&gt; I am continuing my work on my DP to SP conversion.The heat riser from the
SP
&gt; engine is plugged beyond belief. I have worked on it from both ends with
&gt; wire then aircraft cable on the end of a drill ( had to stop for a while
and
&gt; go buy an electric drill as my cordless could not keep up the pace). I
&gt; finally stopped when I found that if I blew on the end, air came out
around
&gt; the aluminum sleeve on the same side. What have I done?
&gt;
&gt; Last night I heated the carbon with an acetylene torch then switched to
&gt; oxygen. That took me nowhere as there was NO flow through the thing. :-(
&gt;
&gt; When I measure, it looks like I have about 1-2 cm to get through before I
&gt; can try the torch again.
&gt;
&gt; The archives mention drilling a hole to get better access, but that really
&gt; seems extreme. Is this what I have to do?
&gt;
&gt; Also, what if I have to put this engine back into the 1971 bus? What will
I
&gt; do for a brake booster connection?
&gt;
&gt; MANY thanks for all the replies I get via P-mail. They are appreciated
even
&gt; if I do not send a thank you e-mail. I figure you are watching my progress
&gt; on these lists!
