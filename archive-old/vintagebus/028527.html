Subject: Need interior trim

On my 63 23 window  i'm missing two pieces of trim on the drivers door--the
lower 14&quot; and upper 21 3/4&quot; long the short upper is OK--If anyone can be of help
and sell these two pieces of trim--Please e-mail me direct, thanks--I finally
have the bus in my garage--no dents in the body--shows Florida surface rust in
spots--all original paint--Not perfect--but will make a great driver--ambulance
step is there but appears frozen--Headliner shows wear and some holes--sunroof
works--Speedo reads 52,526  --I'm told that is the original mileage?  could
be--all panels and two back seats very nice!! front passenger seat can be
restiched--drivers seat Might be able to save--want to keep it original as
possible--bumpers and wheels need to be redone--I think i will go with powder
coating--came with 5 trim rings--owners manual--Reduction gears to me are
noisey--but for some reason PO put on low profile tires?--rubber is not bad--As
of now, all i can see is locating the two pieces of interior trim--thanks--,
hopefully TWWM, uj
PS motor is strong, has a Type III case with outlet for oil pressure light??
