Hello Listees,

Semester break has arrived, that means its time to finally devote some time 
to working on the bus.  Current project: bodywork (still)

I'm realizing that my bus is far from a &quot;rookie&quot; project.  I should have 
picked something a bit easier to be my first bus.  But hey, it's mine, and 
we are good buddies now.  Somehow, all of the mounting plates for the cargo 
doors (all 4) got bent backwards, so the cargo doors still sit flush with 
the body when closed, but when opened, the door close to the hinge hits into 
the beltline, instead of the rubber bumpers hitting the door first.  (wow 
alot of commas in that sentence.)I'm imagining that at one point in time the 
doors somehow got violently opened, and the mount plates got a bit warped.  
I've been working this problem for awhile, and have found new donor backing 
plates for all of the hinge mounts.  I was a bit wary of trying to bend the 
old ones back into shape.  I'm still a bit nervous that my doors will never 
line up right, we'll see.  Since I was into the posts anyway, I took the 
chance to add some hard points for three point seat belts! (Thanks to Mr. 
King at splitbusaustralia_dot_com for the measurements)

Anyway, on to my question for all you sawzall/junkyard kings.  I spent some 
time today removing a nice layer of bondo on the right rear corner.  The 
corner is in bad shape (lots of holes drilled to hold the bondo in place, 
and creased here and there) from the beltline down to about 4 inches above 
the battery tray.  The lower butt cheeks are quite nice, in a platonic sense 
of course.  So, I'd like to cut from the top of the beltline down to about 4 
inches above the battery tray, (top to bottom) and about from the right edge 
of the taillight hole ('64 so big taillights, right side, remember?) around 
the curve to where the rear corner straightens out (right to left).  I 
remember seeing a picture which has since been retired on kelly the metwiz's 
site where he did a similar patch, albeit smaller.  My question is this, can 
I cut a donor piece for this area from an early bay window?  Since I have a 
large rear hatch, the rear quarters look the same to me.  All I would be 
interested in is the outer sheet metal of the quarter panel.  My battery 
tray is replaced (thanks Ronnnie!), and as I said, the cheeks are good.

thanks in advance for all the help.  Someday I'll get some pix posted of my 
bus so y'all can see it.

Mike A.
'64 SO-35 &quot;Sherman&quot; in Salt Lake City.
