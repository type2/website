Subject: More Overheating Problems (1600Dp)

I guess this is the season for hot running motors.

My story.   300 miles on a top end(new p&amp;c's &amp; heads) rebuild on a '71 AE case
1600 DP, all new heads, dog house, all tin (with lower cool tin) in place, all
seals in place, no external cooler or full flow, timing (vacuum &amp; points) and
valves dead on, C/R is stock for this 1600, 34 pict carb.  This motor is pushing
a '62 double cab with a big nut tranny with 205 75 15's.

The problem is hot running (berg dip stick gauge) with just 30 min at speed
(60-65) on a 85 degree day.  I'm guessing this is at least 235 since this is
what the gauge says it actuates at.  I also have a CHT gauge (had it laying
around so decided to use it) on #3 and it stays right around 300-350 on the
freeway no mater what speed I drive.  With the dip stick back in it is a bit too
warm to hold on to for any length after driving, and the oil light flickers
after a freeway run.

The only thing I can think of is a clogged oil cooler.  I cleaned and reused it
and then later read the Hoover comments on such action...dooh!   Any thoughts on
what might be my problem?   I'm planning on adding a pressure and oil temp
gauges.  Where do people install the senders?  I've read all the Hoover stuff on
that, but I'm not going to split the case just to install senders.  This case
has a plug just up and to the right of the oil pump.  I think it has a place for
a hex wrench.  Is this thing the threaded plug the sermons talks about??

One more thing...are there dog house flaps and non dog house flaps?  I have a
set and they don't seem to fit my dog house fan shroud...the linkage seems like
it has to have a wider step to clear the dog house.

Thanks.

Steve
