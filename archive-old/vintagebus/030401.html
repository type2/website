Subject: Rear Shocks

I have wondered through the archives but I have not found my concern on
my rear shocks.

I had the bus on the rack when a friend came over.  He has experience
with (racing) baja bugs.  We discussed the wear on the outside of the
rear tires (10K mi then the outer edge was gone).  He said that on
Bajas, the ones that use the bug rear ends tend to squat (drop) when
they take off, but that bajas that use the bus rear ends with the redux
boxes tend to raise up in the rear when they take off.   He also noticed
I have KYBs shocks and thought that they might be too strong for the bus
since I tend to put my weight (ie tools) forward in the bus (right
behind the driver's seat.)  He thought the combination of the tendency
to have lift on the tires, the heavier shocks and the weight forward
might result in the tires being angled inward causing the outer tire
wear.
Our rear camber looks right even unloaded.

Anyone else have any ideas, comments?
What do you run on a road camper bus for rear shocks??
TIA
