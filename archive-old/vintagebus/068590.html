This design sure seems like a good way to crack major chunks of plastic
off of the wheel's arms!

Rather than pulling on the plastic, it would be better to make a couple of
thick angle pieces to go across below the wheel hub and then split a piece
of pipe (2&quot;?) to put around the shaft and transfer the force from the
angle to the underside of the steering wheel hub.  This would be much
closer to the VW puller function.
