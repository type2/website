My wipers go a bit closer to out of the way on the left, so I
usually stop them there.  

&gt; I have a wiper motor that would have originally been found on a RHD
&gt; bus with shortwave radio.  How cool is that?

Not nearly as cool as if you had the shortwave radio.  Would
that be a Saphire, or something else?  Even more cool would be 
if you had the RHD bus :-)
