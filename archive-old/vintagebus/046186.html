&lt;&lt; I've got the engine out of my westy right now repairing some oil leaks. I 
can see the pulley has been throwing some oil. What is the best way to cure 
this? Has anyone ever tried using a sand-seal pulley? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
The stock pulley has threads on it's outside that pump oil back into the 
engine.  So check your breather hose/s to be clear of oil/water mayonase kind 
of gunk that happens in engines without the thermostatic bellows control 
system in place and/or in cooler winter type of weather and especially if not 
driven for long enough periods to allow the engine to operate at proper temps 
to rid itself of water vapor.  Next remove your rear pulley and make sure the 
threads that pump the oil back in are clear and clean.  If not wire brush and 
sandpaper clean.
  After checking all of the above and you still have oil coming out around 
the pulley it is a good sign that you have too much blowby passing by the 
piston rings and only an engine rebuild will fix your problem.
