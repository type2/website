Subject: bumper

Hi all,

I have a very clean, but plain (nothing attached), front bumper that I removed from my '65 used-to-be-panel. I would like to sell or trade it, but I don't know how to describe it. I hear a lot of different descriptions and I don't know which applies to what I have. Is there an archive thread someone could point me to or a resource (hopefully with pictures) that I could access to help me out?

Thanks a bunch,

SLOJason
