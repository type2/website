Hello everyone
I just went and looked at 2 busses today way out in the mountains. Took
around an hour to get to. Both have been sitting for over ten years and it
seems that the last registration was in the late 60's Even had a nespaper in
one from 1968.
First one was a 58 or 59 kombi. Dove Blue, kinda beat up, missing taillights,
had the original 36hp. Didn't have ribbed bumpers but had the 58 eingine lid
on it, Missing middle seat. vin # seemed to be around a 1957. Weird bus
Asking price was $350.
Needs tires as they are flat or missing Hit in the nose, rocker and corner
rust, and the roof looked jumped on.
The other was a 1960 two-tone microbus Mango Green and Sea Gull Grey, missing
middle seat, roof jumped on, complete interior, pretty nice condition. again
$350. Original 40hp. Pretty good deal, rocker rust. That seems to be it.
Both busses are bench seats and need moderate work, but, for $350 its a
screaming deal.  Price is negotiable. I missed out on another bus and a
single cab that were already sold and gone.
The 59 has the 58 one year only engine lid so even if it were to be parted
out it's a good deal.
The 60 would be really easy to make a driver, barely missing anything and
comes with some extra parts.
These are fairly unmolested and original busses that need some TLC
Let me know if interested and I'll forward phone numbers
These are in Northern California about an hour outside of Chico, or 2 1/2-3
hours north of Sacramento
