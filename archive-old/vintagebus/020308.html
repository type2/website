Reasons for doing ball caps...
Thing about baseball caps is
&gt; 3) can't think of 3 now but got to be other
advantages of caps over tees
------------------------------------------------

Ellis suggests:
&gt; 4) Less chance that they will be in that whacked
tan/pink color of the old Vanagon_at_lenti Tshirt.

&gt; 5) Looks better than a Tshirt on your head.

&gt; 6) Distracts from rather than accenuating the
typical blow gut of the average middle aged male
caucasian techie Unix programer/Network Admin/DBA list
member.

&gt; 7) Less letters than &quot;I'm with Stupid ---&gt;&quot;

&gt; 8) One more excuse not to wash your hair at
campouts.

&gt; 9) Hats are favored by Dwight Yokum and Dave
Easterwood. (sorry about that one!) =)

&gt; 10) When was the last time you ever heard anyone
say, &quot;Come on in, take your Type_dot_com T-shirt and
jacket off?
