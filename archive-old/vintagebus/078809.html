What do you mean 'one of the idiots trying to ruin it for everyone'?
I had to leave on the Saturday and missed the drama and such. It seemed like
a great Jerome for the bit I was there.

the numbers and details are a little different, but uncle jerry can
be forgiven for some blurriness in all the excitement! i was planning
on zipping out as soon as the second number eliminated all my tickets
(933xxx vs my tickets of 917xxx), but the drama was so good i
stayed... there were actually TWO women standing at the end of the
first drawing; an older hispanic woman and devon(?) who i believe is
the daughter of the ABC VP. the hispanic woman had the ticket that
was one number before the first drawn. her three (what looked like)
sons looked very disappointed!!

the second round, devon looked ready to pass out - had she not won, i
think she would have fainted. there was some grumbling behind me
about the VP's daughter winning, but i witnessed BOTH tickets being
drawn, and there was no fishiness - just random chance.  ya gotta
fell REALLY bad for the guy who slept thru the raffle and missed
winning... unless, of course, he was one of the idiots trying to ruin
it for everyone all weekend :p
