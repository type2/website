&gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What is
&gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
&gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers with
&gt; hardware.

Ok
90mph, verified by GPS on the flat, hot summer day, no wind, no drafting of
semi's  (actually not another vehicle in sight)

Hardware:
'60 double cab
2L type IV  7.5:1 cr
CIS Fuel Injection
'74 Thing IRS Trans with bus at stock height.

I now have bigger tires on and will be able to report back next week the results
without fear of wrapping the needle around the zero peg.  I stopped at 90 because
I was driving the needle into the peg.  Had little dinky 165r15's.  Now running
195r14s
