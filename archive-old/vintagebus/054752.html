Subject: oil pressure relief

hey all.
 just drove a few hundred miles on an unknown motor that when i got it had
a dead (and dried up) rat holding #4 exhaust open. after a quick repair, i
put it all together and it drives fine. 
however, when i first started to drive on it, the oil light would
flicker/come on after a short jaunt on the freeway, and it did it every
time i would drive at highway speed, even if just for a mile or so. this
concerned me, as it appeared to be a very recent rebuild. so i checked the
oil pressure relief valves, and lo and behold, there was the aftermarket
&quot;made in taiwan&quot; (when did they make vw's in taiwan?) oil pressure booster
kit with the tall plunger for the rear and the super tight springs which
seem to be about 4 times as thick as a stock spring. 
i replaced both the springs and plungers with NOS units, and the &quot;regular&quot;
plungers, not the tall plunger in the rear passageway. 
THIS HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM! 
after driving around albuquerque, from havasu to monterey, and around here
for a few weeks, not even a hint of a flicker, and none reported by rachel
who i asked every time we stopped if the light came on.
after looking at the springs in the &quot;taiwan&quot; kit, i wonder how they would
compress at all. they are way too thick and seem to have way too much
compressed tension when installed.
i'm just trying to pass on some info i have learned. i have never liked the
booster kits to begin with, and this just seems to confirm my dislikes.
the motor is a stock 1600 single port, nothing fancy.
so maybe if your lite flickers, you may consider checking these small but
critical engine parts.
