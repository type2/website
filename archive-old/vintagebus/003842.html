Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to fill out a blank window sticker for my 1955 Single Cab.  Does
anyone know the original selling price of this vehicle? Also, period
accessories and their original prices would be great!

If anyone wants an aged blank window sticker, or other very cool
reproduction items...
Check here: http://home.swbell_dot_net/albertf/product.htm

I have no affiliation with these guys, but they are very nice people. Lot's
of freebies with every order, nice packaging, sent priority mail, etc.
I got a window sticker, matches, keychain, shop rag,magnet, balloon.... They
also reproduce the restoration stickers exactly as from the factory.

Thanks,

Tom
