&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm wondering if anyone else has ran into this before.  My 63 camper's
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; converted to 12V, but I wasn't able to replace the 4-way flasher relay
&gt; &gt; because there isn't a 12V equivalent for it.
&gt;
&gt; There is a 12V equiv., I have one on my '65 DC and the 4 way flashers do
&gt; work with it. You have to order it directly from a Bosch distributor. I'll
&gt; get the part # and post it for you later.

The part # is 0332 015 001. I bought it from Julianna Co, 800-334-0476.

It mounts a bit differently from the 6V equiv. The 6V piece grounds thru the
cap via a clip that mounts to a hole in a boss under the dash. The new piece
has a separate connector on the circuit board for the ground. Just run a
jumper from this lug to ground.

I think there is a schematic for it somewhere on the net. I'll poke around
and see if I can find it.

Hope this helps.
