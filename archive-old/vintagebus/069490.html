Subject: Re: [VB] Front door gaps.....

Well, about the only effect the door gaps have on me, is the bitter cold
draft that gets through. Only bothers me in the winter anyway (lol). I
looked closer at the front end a little bit ago, and for some reason, the
front bumper is off center, maybe 3/8&quot; to 1/2&quot;. Didn't notice that before. I
think it'll be worth while to take some measurements this weekend, just to
see if something is up.

I probably wont do anything other than mod some door seals to get rid of the
draft untill I get enough time and resources to really work on it. But dang,
it sure would be nice to have the door fit perfect. :-)

----- Original Message -----

&gt; I haven't been following this thread closely but if it's decent original
&gt; paint and if the gap doesn't affect function I wouldn't whip out the jacks
&gt; and scrap wood, it may be it's just how the bus/door is or as simple as
bent
&gt; or saging hinges. I can't imagine any damage from impact that would affect
&gt; the door without doing any body damage.
