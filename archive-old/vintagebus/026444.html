Just had the carb rebuilt -it was so nasty it took 3 days to get back-
now the choke, and fuel and air adjust screws work, but it won't
maintain an idle after it warms up, especially after higher rpm's-any
ideas?
On the fan housing, rear right lower corner, there's a rectrangle lever
with a small nut and bolt with a thin wire through it connected to
nothing-What is this for?
I noticed in my '65&amp;'67 that the ceiling vinyl is perforated in the rear
two sections only-any ideas why and why don't bays have that?
