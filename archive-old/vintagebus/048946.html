Subject: FS: '66 deluxe hardtop --- $1500 obo --- OR
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline

Please respond to the phone number below not me.  I spotted this bus in a
carport, left my number and briefly checked it out.  

Mike Ternyik  (503) 538-4295 

Model:  '66 hard top deluxe walk through

Location:  Newburg, Oregon  (approx 20 mi south of Portland)

Price:  $1500 which is totally negotiable

Some details from memory:   Green w/white, has all exterior trim, nose has dent,
no rear seats, no rear bumper, needs new fuel lines to dual carb set-up due to
small fire (immediately extinguished) promised it ran before the micro-fire, has
all wall panels with chrome strips, dash looked complete, and its rust condition
is better than average (whatever that means). Call him for more details.

C-Ya,
George
