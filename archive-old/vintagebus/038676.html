&gt; I've been holding this from the list till Friday, so...
&gt; Thought I'd fill in the bus list on the drivers training lessons going on.
&gt; My 15yr old daughter is as anxious as a cat on a hot plate to get her license.
&gt; Wants to spend her 16th birthday at the DMV.  So... its drivers training in
&gt; the
&gt; '60 double cab.  Since she can't get her permit until Jan., she has to be
&gt; content with shifting gears as we drive around town.  At first it was VCAS
&gt; (voice command auto shift), but not she has it down where she pays attention
&gt; to
&gt; traffic flow, sound of the engine and the clutch and is making shifts right on
&gt; time.  Caught her a couple times looking out the window and we both had a good
&gt; laugh.  &quot;woops, I was supposed to shift there, wasn't I&quot;.  Reinforces the need
&gt; to stay focused.  We'll be hitting the parking lots next and that should be
&gt; some
&gt; fun.   If she ends up spending most of her driving in the DC the next 6+
&gt; months,
&gt; we figure that she'll use it for the driving test.  Can't wait to see the look
&gt; on the examiner's face as she pulls up to the testing lane in the DC.

&gt; Anybody learn how to drive in a bus?
&gt;

i had a similar story with a lady friend of mine last night. we were waiting
for our friends to finish consuming at the local circle K and she started
wondering where the trunk and the enginge were in the bus. so, i showed her
and then she wanted to know how hard it was to shift. so i showed her
through the gears (parked) and how reverse works. she said that it wasn't
that hard, except for reverse. i just thought it was kind of funny.

i also remember a time when i had my old '73. i was teaching my guitarist
from my band how to drive the bus so i wouldn't be the only one driving it
to shows. he had the hardest time shifting into 4th gear. he'd always go
into second. when he finally did it right, i started yelling out the window
&quot;HE SHIFTED INTO FOURTH! HE SHIFTED INTO FOURTH!&quot; that got some looks.
