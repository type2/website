Subject: Oil
Mime-Version: 1.0

Thicker , heavier oil is not better in an oil cooled, and air cooled
engine. The owners manual of our '65 camper says 20w, and oils were no
where as good as they are now. Oil pressure  from thick heavy oil reduces
the flow, there fore the amount of heat pulled from the cooler. thin oil
flows alot, gets rid of a alot of heat.  20w-50 might be the answer to a
H2O cooled engine in the summer, but not an air -cooled.  Jim
