Subject: Re: [VB] Bay tank into split - filler neck

When I put my bay window tank in, I used the baywindows filler neck with it
as well. The angle of the filler neck isn't a perfect match to where the old
split tank went, but it works just fine. I couldn't bring myself to cutting
the neck off my early bus tank either. I have the old tank stored in the
basement with my other VW jank in case I put it back in someday.

One thing I had to do with my bay window tank, was the breather line that is
located on the top of the tank, I ran the breather line up by the cap,
which, when the tank was all the way full, It would slosh a bit of fuel out
of it on a hard left turn. I fixed that by installing a somewhat large fuel
filter up near the filler neck  as a sort of 'resivoir' for the fuel to
collect in and be able to drain back down, it also doubles as a filter to
keep dirt from getting in the tank from the breather line.
