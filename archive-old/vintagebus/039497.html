Hey all,

Saturday I come in to warm up after some routine maintanace only to find the 
girlfriend watchin some old school flick &quot;whats up doc&quot;.  Some stupid chase 
scene going on w/ some detroit cruisers and a bicycle.  I'm thinkin probably 
gonna see some beatles maybe a bus or two...and then one is spoted a white 
samba!  Seconds later it gets totally macked twice.  The sorry brother who 
owns him goes to open the door of the unscathed side only to have the poor 
bus fall over on his side being less than 2 feet wide.  Gee that sure was 
funny!  My girlfriend thought so.  It seems that in many 60s movies if some 
car is parked minding its own buisness gets macked it always a volksie.  
Zero respect for VWs I guess because they were in such great numbers and 
pretty cheap.  Just wondering how many vintage volksies gave there life for 
hollywood entertainment:(  Just thought I'd vent a bit!

Eric
