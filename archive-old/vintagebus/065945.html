Craig, got a little test for you. Go to the home club discount building supply
place of your choice and get one of those little tubes of &quot;smoke&quot;. It's a fine
little vapor for testing for air leaks around windows and doors. I have found
that it works great in automotive use for finding exhaust leaks and vacuum
leaks.

What you do is run your engine up to about 2500rpm, (I usually put a stick in
the throttle), and then get under the rear and squirt a little vapor around
your heat exchangers. I have found that on a cold day the warm air blowing
through the heat exchanger actually draws cold air into it through the cracks
in the sheet metal around the heat exchangers when your vents are fully open.
If you crank the heat exchanger flaps a little closed then the pressure builds
and blows back out the cracks the way you said. I actually didn't believe
someone when they told me this so I had to find out for myself. It only works
like that if there is a good temperature differential. I tried it when it was
less than forty degrees outside and the engine was good and warm.

i usually drive a bay, so i might be on the wrong track here, but
isn't the heater system pressurized on later splits to keep the
exhaust OUT? ie, the air from the fan should blow OUT of all cracks
and holes in the system, not suck air in. any stinky smells SHOULD be
either 1) exhaust fumes being sucked into the engine fan in the first
place (bad engine compartment seals, leaky heat riser, what have you)
or 2) oil that has dripped into the heater box from the heads burning
off.  on my bay - which has heat for the first time in 6 years :) - i
get a smell like popcorn at the movie theatres from a drippy valve
cover. ick.
