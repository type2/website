Subject: Adventures in metal shrinking...
Mime-Version: 1.0


Yesterday afternoon I made my first foray into hard-core metal shrinking.
I'd bought the &quot;cam type&quot; shrinking hammer from Eastwood - they and HF are
the only ones who had this type, and the HF one I know is JUNK...
Basically, it has an internal cam, so when you hit the metal, it turns the
head.

The principle of metal shrinking is simple: imaging a piece of newspaper
laying flat on the table.  Now put your hand int he center and twist.
Notice how the edges come in to the center?  That's what you need to do to
the metal.  When you get a dent, the metal actually stretches, so you end
up with a larger surface area of thinner metal.

I had a gouge in one of the cargo doors, about 18&quot; long, and about 3/4&quot;
deep at the lowest. 

My first mistake was to try and heat the whole thing and shrink it all on
one swoop. Nope.  I ended up making a bigger mess than what I'd started
with!   What I had to do was work from  the edges toward the middle,
heating an area about the side of a quarter until it was red hot, then
using the shrinking hammer and a slightly curved dolly, wacking it back
down. When you heat the area, it will actually rise, so if for some reason,
you chose NOT to wack it down, it would be worse than what you started
with!  After I'd whacked and flattened a spot, I quenced it with a wet rag;
you can *hear*  the metal shrinking when you do this.

And when you hit it, you have to hit it like you mean it!  No love taps here!

So, it took about an hour of heat/whack/quench, but I got the door
straightened out.  From the backside, you can see where the original crease
was, as a discoloration of the metal, but you can't feel it with your
fingers.  There's a few bumps in the metal from the whackin', but it's very
flat now.

It would be easier if you had two people; one to handle the torch, and the
other to do the wacking - probably safer, too!  I'll probably be doing this
to Tom's single cable gates in the not-too-distance future...

A heck of a lot better than filling it with Bondo!
