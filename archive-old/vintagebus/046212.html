My friend has a high roof panel bus with a horizontal &quot;door&quot; on the side, I
guess this is what you call a &quot;Lunch bus&quot;?
He is now about to sell it. It has almost perfect original green paint, no
rust and in good original condition. Very low mileage.
The perfect mobile part store?

do you mean what I call a Weenie Wagon?   The sales flap open up, so you can
hawk your wares out the side of the bus. (like hot dogs, ice cream etc.   Put
a bell on it and it's the Ice Cream Van)      I saw one once- it was a 67 w/ a
sliding door R and sales flaps left and locking steering coloumn.   Have m
code in a list somewhere

re double door kombis- I never saw one, but I have seen a double door standard
micro ('64- turquoise/bluewhite with that pretty 1 year only green tinted
headliner)
