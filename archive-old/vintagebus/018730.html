NQ &amp; vintage bus list,

The correct spelling on that jet/ metering device was Grose

Here are some links:

http://www.ztherapy_dot_com/master_price_list.htm

says,

SU 301  Grose Jets, per pair  Call on availability, 
these are as rare as an honest politician in October!
$ 30.00

I had a application sheet from the manufacture once and 
I belive it had a GJ for the vw solex

And for all you Art Bell listeners:

The Secret Super High Mileage Report _at_

http://www.himacresearch_dot_com/books/secret9.htm

There is a little known invention called the GROSE JET. 
It is a replacement float bowl valve that seals better
and keeps the fuel level more precise allowing the level 
to be set lower without stalling problems. A regular valve 
is made of neoprene and allows the level to vary up to 1/4 inch. 
Also the additives that keep fuel injectors clean eat away at 
the sealing surfaces, causing poor mileage. The Grose Jet has 
2 Stainless steel balls and when installed with a good fuel 
filter just before the carb, does an excellent job of 
maintaining mileage. I heard about it through George Wiseman. 
He recommended them for his Enhancer system. 
They are only about $7.00-$20.00. 
Their address is  
D &amp; G Valve Manufacturing Co. Inc. 
8 Mount Vernon St., Stonham MA 02180.
(617)438-1773 

Aloha
