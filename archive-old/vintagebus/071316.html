Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

----- Original Message -----

&gt; If your stock system is working fine-the addition of the 300 btu's won't
&gt; add anything more that you could really notice.
&gt;
&gt; Don't tax the antique electrical system with an unnecessary overload--
&gt;
&gt; The 12 volt heater/ defrosters barley have enough heat in them to
&gt; defrost a windshield let alone produce enough heat in your Bus to be of
&gt; any real benefit--
&gt;

I agree 100% with Terry. I tried the electric heater thing in a bug (not
even a bus) back when I was in high school. For the amount of power it drew
from the alternator, I got squat for heat. It was a total waste of money.
