Hey Michael:

Thanks for the words, I guess it happens to all of us at one point or another.  My gut told me I needed to log more miles on the motor, especially highway miles, but there just wasn't time.

The interesting thing is, the bus runs great from 0-50mph, regardless of gear.  It will cruise fine in 4th at 40-50mph, but once I reach low 50's and higher, that's when the problem starts.  I had been driving the bus all week, but only around town.  Since I was running it through all of the gears, I thought all was fine.  It doesn't seem to be related to rpm's, only speed.  I can increase the rpm's in 2nd and 3rd gear, and there are no problems.  It's just when I hit those high speeds that one does in a vintage 36hp stock motor.  :)  Although I have to tell you, the short period of time it was cruising at 62mph felt really good.  I would have never dreamed the camper could exceed 55mph.  I guess it has to do with it being a brand new NOS motor.  It isn't tired, yet.

Time to put it under the scope.

Robert

I know the feeling, after spending 4 years getting 60 sunroof kombi restored its maiden voyage made it is as far as the gas station and would not restart after i shut it off. Eventually got it repaired but I know how depressing it can be. I know your 59 westy will be will worth the wait Robert when it does get back on the road.

Hey Robert,

Don't bang your head too hard against the wall.
You'll get there.

All this anticipation will just make your bus all the better when you
finally do show up.  Sure, you'll be able to point out all the flaws but
those who judge will probably not be able to point to something of theirs as
better.

Chin up!


So, where is Familienfest?  :-)
