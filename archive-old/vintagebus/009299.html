... damn this IS weird!!!  Mine was built early July (dont recall the exact
date, I'll look it up later on), in the later days of the model year.  I
wonder if they ran out of seats with holes and &quot;dipped&quot; into the '68 stock a
couple of weeks early.

&gt; Hey that is interesting! When was your 67 built? Mine is dated
&gt; 6.20.67. Wonder is there was a mid year change. BTW, my middle seat
&gt; is original to the bus.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;... beg to differ concerning the holes in the rails for a '67 (not that
that
&gt; &gt;trivia is going to change the world &lt;&lt;grin&gt;&gt;)
&gt; &gt;The (original) middle seat on my '67 does not have holes in the rails.
&gt; &gt;There is a clip that connects to the nub and bolts over the top of the
rail;
&gt; &gt;there are eight of them total.  I know this to be a fact as just this AM
I
&gt; &gt;pulled the middle seat out of the bus so I can haul an RV generator to
the
&gt; &gt;loal repair shop tomorrow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  1967 (one year onlyish ) has holes in the rails for the nubs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;There's differences, but a bay seat will _fit_ in a split.  The bay
seats
&gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;use the seat clamps with nubs on them as opposed to the split kind,
which
&gt; &gt;are
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;smooth.  The nubs go into holes on the seat legs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
