&lt;&lt; NOW WHAT??????????
 I don't know what is involved in fixing it.  Help. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
We know this sounds wierd, but we have one of thoses carbs that someone 
threaded a spark plug into the hole!  It works well enough, but we cut off 
the insulator end, and the inner electrode.  Do not know if this could be 
done on the side of the road without a tap or just by turning the spark plug 
into the opening.  The latter might work since the carb material is rather 
soft.  At worse this is a possible fix sometime on the road one dark and 
rainy night!   Eric&amp;Barb
