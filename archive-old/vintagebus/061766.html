&gt; ** As a side note to the previous discussions on the 912 pulley upgrade be
&gt; sure to take care of your fan as to not let it explode due to the higher
&gt; RPMs it will be turning (Eric&amp;Barb reminded me to mention this in an
&gt; off-list e-mail).  I will be welding the tabs on mine before installing the
&gt; pulley.  I think Berg still offers a welded fan if you do not care to weld
&gt; one up yourself.

Need to balance it too.  Berg does both to the fans they sell that have
been welded.
