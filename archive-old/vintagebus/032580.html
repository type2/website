i have my antenna, in a bus that never had one, laid over the top op my
parcel tray, somewhat extended.  there is a brace/bracket/metal piece that
it lays on on the passenger side, near the grab handle, and then it goes
all the way across.  i had to run a ground wire so it gets am, but no big
deal.  don't drill!  hide it.  i have very good reception, and the antenna
is about 1/2 to 3/4 extended too.   plus, i don't think there was a stock
place anyway, since most radios were dealer installs, they could put them
just about anywhere.  i usually see them under the passenger side window
post, though.

&gt; I hate to drill it, but if I do put an antenna on the car I'd prefer to do
&gt; so in an original style - realizing this was a dealer job &amp; so I probably 
&gt; have a bit of latitude. 
&gt; 
&gt; So what's your stock-looking antenna setup? What sort of mounting?  Where
&gt; is it mounted, if not right front?
