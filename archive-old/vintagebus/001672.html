Subject: BNNTA Video for sale???

I saw quite a few people taking video of the BNNTA event.  I would like to
know if anyone on here was one of the people who parked along side the
highway and took a video of all of the buses going by.  I saw several people
doing this.  I'd like to buy a copy.

Also, Woody was parading around the campgrounds with his camera - come on
Woody - how much for copy.  I gotta have your tape - it's got me on it in my
pj's I'm pretty sure!
