&lt;&lt; But this week I ordered the emblem clips from Wolfsburg West, however they 
don't carry or reproduce the seals, I know that there were seals of some sort 
because remnants still remain stuck in the yellow paint.   what have other 
people done to deal with this and don't tell me roofing tar. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ty,
Go out and hop into your bus.  Slide over to the far right front seat and 
look up at the right side of the air vent.  Notice the speed nut and washer 
on that end of the interior ventilator?  Those are what VW used for not only 
the front VW emblem, but also the radio block off plate 1955-very early 67.  
It would be a good idea to apply a thin layer of tar to the seals to prevent 
seeping of water into the nose of the bus.  This and worn out wiper pivots 
allow water to rust out the nose of the bus.  Seems like VW knew of this and 
installed the right side dash support to drain the drips from the passenger 
wiper away from the package tray!  DPO of our 1960 panel cut holes and 
installed gauges on the far passenger dash side!  Now with these empty holes 
we can see when our passenger wiper pivot is worn the drip of water onto the 
dash support which dumps it like a rain gutter forward of the package tray 
and down.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS also a really good idea to take out a flash light and small mirror and 
with the front kick panels out the lower inner surface of the nose, and 
attack anything in there with a vaccume, and crevice noozle.  When we got our 
1960 panel it turned out to have about 15 Lbs. of sand up there!  Have heard 
of sringes and other crud dumped in there which will cause your factory sheet 
metal to rust out much faster if not found out beforehand!   EEE&amp;B
