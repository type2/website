 &quot;Drakula&quot;-- has a new and perfect home in Indiana--A Funeral Home--He will 
be on display
 and used as requested--It took a while to find him a &quot;Home&quot; --but it was 
worth it.
 &quot;Bessie&quot;-- the 1967 Hippie van will be earning her keep--On February 26th, 
Monday,  Bessie
 makes her debut in The Wall Street Journal--Bessie will be among the Big 
Buck Boys--on the
 road again--
 
  &gt;&gt;
that is excellent.  do they mind if you tell us all who bought it?     Just 
in case anyone wants to plan their funeral?
