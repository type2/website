Subject: RE: [VB] Replacing front rubber. Zinc primer 1st?

Actually, the POR adheres well to primer. You get a better result as far
as rust proofing by getting the POR directly onto the metal, but if you
had a factory or otherwise well-adhering primer coat already on good
metal, then a layer of POR can add a non-porous barrier inside your
paintwork. Just don't try sanding down through it. It cures rock hard, and
will interfere with any high-quality finish you are trying to get, if it
should pop up into the mix.

I sprayed a layer of POR on primer all around the inner frame areas of all
windows during the restoration of the 67. I used a brush to cover the lips
nicely as well, then sprayed a coating of the primer over the whole mess
at the 2 hour point. I gave instruction to the sanding guys not to sand
the window areas. It came out fine - the seals on all windows cover the
areas where the POR went between two layers of primer.

To be successful with any bare metal work, be sure the metal is properly
prepped first, so things will adhere to it.

&gt; not all the metal that ends up bare will be covered in POR-15 so it will
&gt; essentially be zinc primer on bare metal too.  I don't think the POR-15
