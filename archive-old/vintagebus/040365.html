Thanks to Matt Roberds who sent me some technical drawings, I have idea
where the key goes.

I still don't have a clue what to do, so see if this makes sense.

1. mark point of steering column on steering box in case woodward key is
loose and not in a groove.
2. I will undo the steering wheel nut, remove the steering wheel, and see
what is underneath (I don't know). I am hoping to see something else to take
off so I can fish the wire.

Anyone know what the small metal cylinder is? Inside steering column on a
1965 bus. (barbie doll beer can sized, sorry couln't think technical at this
hour.)

Any done this silly stunt? I am not sure what the woodard key is supposed to
be holding. Rest assured, I will document this for the future generations!

ps we need to get type2_dot_com to a reliable server. Goto tracert_dot_com to see
how bad it is. It is slower than a 28.8 dialup from three places around the
world.
