 &lt;&lt;   Also how much have people seen 
  side steps going for.  Sorry for that question, I'm sure I'll get heckled, 
I 
  just haven't been to a swap meet or ever seen one for sale but have one!  
  I've heard they've never been supplied by the aftermarket.. &gt;&gt;
 
 If you mean the step over the passenger doors (cargo doors for you 
commercial 
 owners), these are available at Bus Boys et al
  &gt;&gt;

never saw a step that goes over the cargo doors, is that to help climb on the 
 roof rack?
