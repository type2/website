&gt;Hi Rex,
&gt;Unless there is something really wierd about either carb, that should work.
&gt;Though most likely the pilot jet from the 28PICT will be too small for a
&gt;1600SP and especially a DP.  Our  VWACFLAPCS called Bow Wow has the pilot
&gt;jets availible new for less than $5.00 each.

You should get a 30/31 carb. They dont cost that much, will replace the carb 
you have, they are new, and they are jetted for the 1600 dual right out.
Jason
