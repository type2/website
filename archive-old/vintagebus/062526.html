&gt; My question is, where was everyone at the RMMW show??

    Steve, we were there in the CAMPSITE, which was the place to be at this
&quot;show/swap?&quot;. Looked for you but never saw you! You are right about the
show/swap, but the real reason to hit this event(I did 1200 miles in 3 days)
was the beautiful campsite, nice weather(got into the 30's at nite), great
food, wonderful folks (at least 4-6 listees), nice entertainment(DVD
movie/pics of the day's events shown w/ a laptop/digital projector/bedsheet
hung between the trees, etc.), not to mention the low key, any bus is a good
bus attitude of the sponsoring Colorado Bus Club, &amp; the owner of RMMW who
fed everyone on Friday nite, came around the campsite thanking everyone for
showing up, etc.  There were over 100 buses camped on Friday night.
&gt; 

Sorry we missed you!
