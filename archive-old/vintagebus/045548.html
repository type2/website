:)  love it.

Hey if you aren't sure it's reading right, it's usually the sender.     where 
is the sender?   sounds like it could be at the bottom of the oil pressure 
relief, not all the oil falls out, just some,  Put a pot of water on the 
stove to boil, then undo the sender, you can quickly switch for a plug in a 
couple minutes (use something to catch a few drips) and  then drop the sender 
attached to wire the boiling water, now turn the ig on, what is boiling point 
on your guage?

You didn't tell us what your weather is like or what kind of motor you have 
or did it pass the spit test.

The motor in my 65 westy used to run really cold in winter.  I drove through 
Oregon with the carb iced up and the engine case cool enough to leave my hand 
on indefinately, this was in December, driving straight through Oregon (300 
miles)  This was before I got the preheat and thermostat set up
