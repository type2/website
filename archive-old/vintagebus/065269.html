&gt; i know batteries don't work as well when cold, but why?

&gt; I thought that heat causes resistance in wires-so shouldn't cold reduce
&gt; resistance(ie superconductors, which I believe are super chilled) and
&gt; therefore a cold battery working on cold wires should work better?

To oversimplify, the chance of a chemical reaction occuring increases
with the speed of the molecules that are doing the reacting.  The more
collisions, the more reaction.  Warming the chemicals that react will
cause them to react more readily.  Since batteries work on a chemical
reaction, they will work better when warm.
