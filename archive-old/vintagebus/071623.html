&gt; 2)  Jumping from one subject to another ...  Is there anyway to find where
&gt; your bus has been ?? I mean, like a pedigree .. names of owners are not
&gt; important .. just wondering if you bought it in Florida and it is 36 years
old
&gt; .. where has the bus been ... where did it's first owner live ?  How long
&gt; people owned it before passing it on ??

Go to www.vintagebus_dot_com and enter your M-code info.
There is a metal tag on the overhead vent on the passenger
side which has numbers on it. The site will explain.
Search the archives at www.type2_dot_com for &quot;birth certificate&quot;.
I hear that $20 cash in an envelope gets fast results.
