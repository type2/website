&gt;  ( 70 Bus, engine to crossmember ).
&gt;I've heard of adapter plates for this, but can't find the info in
&gt;the library or archives
&gt;Can i weld an adapter plate to the oil pump cover , or
&gt;tee off the bottom case bolt ?
&gt;Dave


Please dont mount a holder to the oil pump. You can actually buy that 
adapter, but dont do it. Get another case. Do something else, tap it if you 
can.

Or better still seeing as how this is a vintage bus list, buy a earlier bus 
:)
