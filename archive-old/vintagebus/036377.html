Message-ID: &lt;7memvp$a572_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

 as the owner of an early barndoor, late model means different things
to different people. late model to me is 1953 and on. if someone needs
help with an upright engine then that's what this list is hear for. if
someone has a question with pancakes or water pumpers then there are
other sources available.

&gt; Howdy folks-
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 68 Riviera hardtop with a 1600 sp motor.  I have been subbed
here
&gt; for a month or so, and find the upright engine content refreshing
compared
&gt; to the type2 loaf list, which I have been reading for quite some time.
&gt; 
&gt; I know it's a loaf and that this is the splitty list - but how would
&gt; posting questions  (about engine stuff for example) go over?  I just
posted
&gt; to the loaf list about a clutch problem.  I get the feeling there's
as much
&gt; or more wisdom here as there on a topic like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
