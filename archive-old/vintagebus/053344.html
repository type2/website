&lt;&lt;  Does not seem to leak while driving, as I have dried trans, drove, 
stopped a while, then oil.  Is it feasible to apply sealant to this area when 
clean and dry to avoid
 this small leak? &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
Yes you can if you remove the tranny, dissassemble the RGB on the leaky side, 
remove the leaky axle tube, buy or make new paper gaskets and finger paint 
them lightly with silicon sealant just before reassembling the tranny.
  For stocker jetting check out the 30 PICT-3 in the bus listed in the 
Without GuessWork manual in the obsolete documents website.  Just remember 
the stock air cleaner for that year bus was one of the 1968-1971 type and any 
pre-1968 bus air cleaner is going to cause it to end up running rich.
