Hi all,

I have been working on getting my '64 single cab on the road
for about a year now, working at a snail's pace because of other
projects that have come and gone during that time.  Finally,
the time has come to make some progress with the 40hp engine
I pulled out of the truck about 9 months ago!

Originally, I had pulled the engine to investigate a problem
with the starter motor gear teeth not meshing with the flywheel
gear teeth.  That problem turned out to be a 12-volt starter
installed with a 6-volt flywheel, easy to fix (6-volt starter
with a 12-volt solenoid).

While the engine was out, I decided to take it apart down to the
long-block and clean all the parts and the long-block itself.  It
was *filthy*, lots and lots of dirt and grime.  I also needed to
locate some missing engine tin, replace the external-only oil
cooler with a stock one, and scrounge up a stock muffler to 
replace the rusty old extractor muffler that was on there.

This last week, having all the parts I needed accumulated over
the last few months, I started cleaning the long-block one last
time and then decided, what the heck, I'd pull the long-block
apart and rebuild anything that might need rebuilding........

Fortunately, the engine internals look quite good, I won't
have to align-bore the case, the cam looks good, even the pistons
and cylinders don't show much wear.

But I've got a few questions for the experts out there.

First, the oil pickup tube in the bottom of the right case half
is loose in it's hole.  I can move it up and down and about
1/2 inch in and out of the hole in the case that it fits into.
I can see a few peen marks both on the tube near it's insertion
as well as on the case itself which tell me that attempts have
been made in the past to fix the problem.  How can I tighten up
this tube?  Is peening the way to do it?  Can I remove the
tube completely and stretch it?  I notice that there is a plug
in the case over the mounting point but haven't attempted to
remove this plug, it doesn't look like a screwdriver would fit
in the slot properly.

Another question.  I'm planning to take the cylinders down to
the local parts house so that I can try fitting new rings into
the bores to see how much wear there is.  The old rings (or the bore)
are worn so that the ring end gap is too large (greater than .035&quot;)
for the top compression ring and the oil ring.  If the new rings
fit well, I'll just re-ring the pistons and reuse the pistons and
cylinders.  If I do this, I suppose I have to hone the cylinders.
There is only the very faintest hint of a ridge so I guess I would
have to ream the ridge and break the glaze on the cylinder walls.
Any information on a procedure for doing this would be welcomed.
(If the new rings don't fit, I'll just replace the pistons, cylinders,
and rings.  These are $135 at BAP here in Tucson, anyone know where
I can get them for a better price?)

I'm still working on the cylinder heads, haven't taken the valves out
yet but they look good so far.  I'll have more questions when I
get those apart.

I really miss having Bob Hoover's sermons on-line right now!  Any
progress on that CD Bob?

Many thanks,

 -Dyer Lytle in Tucson
