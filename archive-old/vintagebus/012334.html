I lived in Vail Colorado for a winter with my 66. Other than studded tires all around and a little thinner crankcase oil the main thing I would recomend is a good synthetic tranny oil. The winter we were there it got to 15 below zero (F) and you would have to drive about a mile in first gear before the oil would warm up enough to let you shift. Be careful and find one that meets the specifications of the GL4 Hypoid oil that VW recomends.

Hope this helps,
