Subject: Re: [VB] wives - don't tell 'em til it's too late (risky)

The secret every time I've wanted to get a bus has
been to keep at my EXTREMELY patient wife until she
sees the merit of the purchase........or gets sick of
me going on about it :o)
For the first year of our marriage I couldn't even
drive and so when I got my licence I started bugging
her to get a VW.
At the time I preferred Beetles but wasn't going to be
fussy about it.
I'd just about given up &amp; only whimpered now &amp; again
about how much more fun a VW would be than our
Mitsubushi when out of nowhere one day she suddenly
says &quot;It'd be nice to own a Kombi&quot; with a coy look on
her face.
Since then, despite spending her inheritance from her
grandfather on a '72 SC that turned out to be a money
pit and having various BIG mechanical problems on
other buses, not to mention the immobile hulk that is
my 67 Panel project taking up our only garage where
ever we've lived, she is a big bus fan.
She cried like a baby the day we sold our first bus,
76 Camper which succumbed to rust, &amp; although she
claims that &quot;it only breaks down when I'm driving it&quot;,
she still claims our 77 Microbus handles better than
our '00 Isuzu and thinks the bus is much more fun to
cruise in despite the fact it has no radio, seats that
now resemble griddles and engine &amp; gearbox noise in
the afterburner decibel range :o)
So if I say &quot;Can I get this?&quot; &amp; she says &quot;No&quot; then I
say O.K. and remember the fact that she wandered
'round with me a fortnight ago at the Aussie VW
Nationals while I bored her silly with stuff that
doesn't interest her(the engine, suspension, age)
instead of commenting on the &quot;important&quot;
things....fuzzy dice, the colour of the paint,
eyebrows, camping interiors and flowers and stickers.
I also spent $55 we didn't have in the next week on
parts &amp; she just smiled sadly &amp; said it was fine and
gave me a hug.
Don, lose the buses if you must, win back your wife
and THEN find a bus she'd like to travel in.
Let some other poor beggar fix half of a sinking bus
then you can take it off his hands for a steal...when,
of course, you're out of the dog house ;o)
:o)
Cheers
