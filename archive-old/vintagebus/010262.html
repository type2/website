Subject: Re: [VB] Hemp Seat Covers !!

one more thing, these covers are an off white or cream, its the natural
color of the fabric, and are designed to go over the existing vinyl seat
covers, im not sure if i made that clear
jb/alabama

&gt; My wife and i made some really nice Hemp Front  bucket seat covers for my
66
&gt; walkthrough. They are made from a 55%hemp 45% cotton denim twill. This is
an
&gt; 8oz fabric and it is pre washed. They are made to fit exactly , which isnt
&gt; easy, so the passenger side has 2 seperate covers and the driver side is
&gt; attached with snaps. There is a nice elastic pocket on the back of the
&gt; drivers seat, tool roll size. These are perfect for a daily driver to
&gt; protect your resto seats or to get by until you can get some nice seats,
&gt; they are preshrunk and washed and washable in the washing machine!  The
&gt; Hemp/Denim is very nice for dyeing tooo, it works well with procion and
rit
&gt; dye.  We value them at $50 a pair, and we need parts ! And because i spent
&gt; all my cash on parts, we need money too :).
&gt; If anyone is interested please email me for pics.
&gt; And if anyone has a rear seat for my 66 let me kno, im into a fold down
bed
&gt; type if you have that,  and as soon as i have that  i will have rear seat
&gt; covers available as well.
&gt; i have a 79 west as well, so curtains(incl front snap in)  and seat covers
&gt; are available for those years.
