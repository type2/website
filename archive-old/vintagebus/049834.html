Subject: Re: [VB] WTB: EUROPEAN HEADLIGHT BULB SOCKET

&gt;&gt; Time to clear your closet of that one small part I need.
&gt;
&gt;I need one of the bulb holders for the '60 to '67 European headlight
&gt;assemblies.  The part
&gt;number is 111 941 159.
&gt;
&gt;It's mostly round and has a 1 1/4 inch spring that you compress as you
&gt;screw the socket into
&gt;the reflective part of the housing.
&gt;
&gt;The part that is not round has two spring-loaded retainers for the running
&gt;light wires.  The
&gt;running light mounts right next to the headlight bulb and sticks through a
&gt;small hole in the
&gt;reflective part of the assembly.
&gt;
&gt;Any help or leads would truly be appreciated.


Try this guy.  He's in Germany and he sold me my set of NOS euro lights.
