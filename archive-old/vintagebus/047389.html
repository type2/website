 I'm telling anyone not to go to Jerome, or not to drive their buses.  I'm
 saying *think* about what you're doing.  This is not some jihad of
 bus driving. There is no fatwah for driving a bus to Jerome.  See the
 forest for the trees.  Recycle.  Give a hoot, don't pollute.  Visualize
 whirled peas.

um

I am sensing a pilgramage to Mecca feel about Jerome.

if you haven't made the trek at least once in your life......

but seriously,  I don't think anyone has purposely TRIED to get a JJ award.  
Some friends of mine from OLY got one at Jerome a few years ago  (he was 
teaching at a university in AZ for a year) because of the psychedelic really 
well done (IMO) hippy murals all over the bus.  OH SHEEZ! Now everyone for 
the past couple years as been muralising  their buses to get JJ awards!!!

ur- couldn't you give a little credit for the people who ARE talking about 
fixing stuff now and doing preventative maintenace on their buses?  (Even if 
the emphasis isn't on making them shiny?- shiny dont make it run better)    
It's a month away till Jerome.  

Then again, seems like Thom's buses are probably completely unsafe, he never 
leaves town in them except for the one time he was bribed with cheap beer and 
gas money by LHC Howard.
