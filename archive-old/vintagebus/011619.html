	It must be very difficult for B. Hoover to place himself in
harm's way and then lament that decision.  By advertising that he is a
knowledgeable and competent mechanic of all things, including quantum
mechanics, through the methodical answering of most questions posed to
him at his public address, he establishes first and foremost that he is
*willing* to do so.  If he is overwhelmed by the number of questions and
responses, then he shouldn't have place himself out there as a resource. 
Rather than become bitter about the task of replying, he should simply
drop out.  Place the knowledge he has to offer in the sermons, update
them when he changes his mind, and leave out any personal contact. 
Clearly his rambling is in part due to the necessary &quot;futter mein ego&quot;
spirit of any engineer, let it exist as that only.  I suggest he cease
any further communication with the strangers he so loves and abhors....

or- perhaps i've just had too much to drink tonight...
