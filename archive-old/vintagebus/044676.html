Being relatively new to the nuances of bus restoration I have a newbie style 
question.  This thread is talking about restoration of window frames... the 
actual frame surrounding the glass right ?  I haven't gotten near that stage 
yet but a cursory exam of my windows before the bus was overwhelmed with my 
bug restoration effort I did not see any screws.
............

The pop out windows have three seals.  On is on the bus body, on is on 
outside edge of the frame, another between the frame and glass.

If you peel back a bit of the seal on the body by the hinge, you can see 5 
slotted screws that hold the pop out to the bus.   If you take the seal on 
the outside of the frame off near the seams in the frame- in that channel 
where the seal should go are two slotted screws at each seam, but if it is 
installed in a bus you are drivering you probably do not want to rip apart 
the seal on the frame there, so just believe they are there.  If you get a 
bentley book it shows all this.

//////////
Another reason I ask is that we have a specialty store near here.. the 
&quot;screw shop&quot;.  If what I hear is correct I should try to extract a screw and 
touch bases with them... what was the size again ?
..............
 if you are not dealing with the pop outs, leave them alone.   Patience is 
best for extracting the screws.  use penetrating oil and tapping. take a 
week.   easy to mess up the heads of the screws.   Then you have to drill.   
The size is in the email you copied below.

&gt;  ...and also I hear that finding replacement screws is hard.

&gt;I ordered enough screws for 6 popouts sometime last
&gt;year from Wolfgang.  I think it ran me about $5.  It
&gt;is a 3.5X5mm flat head screw.  Have a nice day :)
&gt;- - -  --
&gt;great- I am glad they are available.   Hurray for Wolfgang.    I forget
&gt;exactly what the deal was, but I heard that the replacement screws people 
&gt;had
&gt;found had a diff size head or length or something they were not quite 
&gt;right.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know have many buses you have to take apart to fill a little film
&gt;container with good used popout window screws?
