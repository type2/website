I agree.  I drive a bay, I tend to stop for any aircooler that is broken
down and apparently needs help.  Last three stops were for a late bay,
splittie singlecab, and karmann ghia.

Anyone who asserts that bay drivers won't help splittie drivers is being a
bit snobbish themselves.  There are all kinds of people out there and good
people drive all kinds of vehicles.
