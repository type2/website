Steve,
If it was my bus I'd stick with the AE case.  First of all, finding a good H
case may not be all that easy.  The oiling should be better on the AE case
and you should have a doghouse setup on it right?  Don't the H cases have
smaller oil cooler ports as well?
My opinion...
you already have an AE case, why go search for an H case that is probably
more worn out that the case you have?
If you are making this a stock show bus maybe you need an H case, if you are
going to drive it all the time use the case you have or even get a brand new
one.

Original Message:

My question is this:  Should I go out and search for  a rebuildable &quot;H&quot;
case to keep it totally original, or if the AE case is good just build a
runner on that?   I know that the later case has the dual oil relief
valves.  Is it that much better than the 1500 H?  BTW I plan on making
the motor a 1641 and I still want to use the stock carb and vac dizzy.

Thanks for any input!
