Subject: RE: [VB] Tie Rod fun!

I believe you replace the entire tie rod.  I guess you could cut and
weld but that seems a bit more hassle.

The right side (no adjustments) is completely baffling to me.

The right side tie rod ends look pressed or crimped into the tie rod.
How 
do the old tie rod ends come out?  Also it appears that there is no
threads 
to screw into?
