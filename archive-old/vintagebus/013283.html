Hey y'all,
We just rolled in around 6:00 tonite from an awesome trip down south that 
included the 2 VW shows in Anaheim and Irvine. Decided to make a huge road 
trip of it and drove from Van. BC down to LA in 2 days. We did the 
Disneyland thing, 6 flags (choice place!!) saw the octo show and the classic 
the next day and then slowly drove the 101 and the #1 all the way back up 
the coast. What a beaut. drive! The scenery is really nice.
The bus wasn't truly ready for such a long trip - 3800 km's (or 2400 
miles)round trip, so we had to take the &quot;non volkswagen&quot; but next year I 
plan to do the trip in my hopefully close to being somewhere near finished 
bus!
What a couple of great shows! The OCTO meet was just amazing. Making that 
left turn at the corner there and seeing all those buses made chills go up 
my spine. All the swap stuff and parts for sale!
Walked outta there wite a couple of nice mirrors, door latches, heater knob 
$15 cheap front chrome emblem and even a front bumper that we had to strap 
to the roof. All of this and I won a t-shirt and hatch beading from the 
split bus club.
The Classic the next day.... holy _at_$#&amp;!!!
I have never seen a show this big! 7th heaven for christ's sake.
I'm sure the wives had wished they hadn't come with us when we saw the 
parking lot. Row upon row of polished beautes. I used five rolls of film 
taking snaps of everything. (mostly buses though of course!)
Bought more parts, drank beer that cost the same amount as a bottle of coke 
- can you believe that!, ate &quot;in and out&quot; burgers - what a great day.
Did anybody check out the VW bricks? Came home with 4 of those babys!
And how about the 23 window deluxe for $1000 bucks?
Again what an awesome weekend and I surely well be seeing ya there again 
next year.
