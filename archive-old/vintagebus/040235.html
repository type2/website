I'm about ready to put my engine back in, and I noticed that the area on the 
transmission surrounding the fly wheel is a bit scuffed up along the left 
side.  (picture)  http://www.mtcnet_dot_net/~mdaniel/bus/Trans.jpg
It's like something was scraping against it.  Should I worry about this?
Thanks as always,
