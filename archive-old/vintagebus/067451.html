Hi Don,
Either use the old version off the old engine or brand new one of that type.  
The best most trouble free clutch pressure plate for bus that we have found 
is the nine spring 200mm type.  Have tried earlier and later type with 
problems.  This nine spring easily lasts over 100,000 miles if not drag 
raced!
