Subject: Re: [VB] Garage/Shop suggestions

Jim, these are all REALLY GREAT suggestions:  high ceiling, insulation,
attic or upper floor, room around vehicle.

Steve, depending on where you live, the most building you can buy for the
least money are metal &quot;pole barns&quot;.  These things go up in days, not weeks,
last a life time, no siding or shingles to worry about.  Around here, the
lightning won't hurt them, neither will the termites!!

I've got THREE 30x50 metal buildings for the price of what ONE stick built
building would cost.  One of my barns has 16' walls so I have a full
upstairs storage area that is great.  The other two have 12' ceilings so I
can work on tractors and tall trailers.  The tall ceilings are great for
hanging cool stuff too.


&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;I am a VW enthusiast, not a professional mechanic, so take these comments as
&gt;such.  I am a builder, so I know what is cost effective when constructing.
&gt;Make sure you use at least 8' doors.  Additional cost is minimal, and my bus
&gt;won't fit in 7' doors with roof rack on.  I like at least 3' clear of the car
&gt;on the sides of the &quot;working bay&quot; and at 4' behind.  Front may contain work
&gt;benches and storage.  I recommend a 30' depth.  Also, I recommend a minimum
&gt;of 10 and probably 12' ceiling in the working bay.  This allows for you to
&gt;jack the bus up with the roof rack on without hitting the garage door opener.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Remember that up is cheap.  When building a structure, to add another floor
&gt;or loft for storage, will cost you next to nothing.  If you think about it,
&gt;the foundation (footings), slab and roof remain the same $.  What it costs
&gt;you to go vertical is extra studs (or Length), some extra sheathing and
&gt;siding.  Relatively cheap in the realm of the initial building.  If you are
&gt;going to use roof trusses you must decide now if you are going use the attic
&gt;as storage and tell the designer/manufacturer.  All trusses are designed with
&gt;a minimum dead load that will only support the sheet rock hung on the bottom,
&gt;and a man walking across them.  They can design for storage, and the cost
&gt;will be cheap as it has more to do with design than material.
&gt;
&gt;You cannot have enough electrical outlets in a garage.  Going to use a welder
&gt;or compressor?  100 amp service may not be sufficient and may require a 200
&gt;amp electrical service.  Put outlets in the ceiling for garage door openers
&gt;and drop lights.  Insulation is cheap when building, put it in.  It not only
&gt;helps with energy costs, but keeps the noise in and the family/neighbors
&gt;complaints out.  That's all I can think of now.  Good luck with the project.
&gt;
