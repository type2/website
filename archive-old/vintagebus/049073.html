Can't this be accessed from inside the engine compartment?  I know there isn't much room inside there, but should be enough to get the job done.  As for what holds the nut in position, I'm going to assume it's welded in place.  You could prolly check the side gate hinges from the treasure chest area to see how those are mounted and deduce the rear gate hinges are the same.?
