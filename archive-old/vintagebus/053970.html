Subject: Anybody own a 40hp bastard engine bus? L_at__at_K&gt;&gt;&gt;

All buses between June `59 and May `60 had a modified
36hp engine otherwise known as the bastrad 40HP. 

I have one in my 42K orig mile westy late may `60.  

Is there anybody out there that has one of these
beasts or perhaps the weired engine parts.  I am
looking for a couple things mainly as spares.  And i
have some parts to trade also.

Mainly I need
-the small bolt on vents for the heads just under the
intake.  Heck Ill even take detailed pics or
descriptions!
-any bastard gasket sets
-any bastard cylinder to head copper gaskets (yes they
are different!  Bigger then 36 and smalled then
regular 40s!!
-Factory worksohop manual for the bastard
bus...probably a `59 issue workshop manual
--any other parts as spare

I have some parts to trade
-main seals
-fuel pump
-cylinder tins
-1 set of great used bastard only p-c's
-1 set of rough used bastard only heads

I am also looking for info on owners manuals for
these.   I have located a May `59 but was curious if
there was a later August `60 maybe?  I have NEVER seen
or heard of one.  Just the May `59 issue.

Anybody have any of these manuals?
