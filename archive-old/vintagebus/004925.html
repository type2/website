I want to thank Ken and H Steven (the original Dworkin) for all they have
done, and whatever they still feel like doing. Truly class acts, both of
them. Anyone who has been around awhile has to be impressed with the manner
in which they have conducted themselves and the work of the list. It will be
up to the new guard to maintain the high level of integrity they have
demonstrated, because if wise choices aren't made on the day to day business
of the lists, they will collapse under their own weight. Keeping these lists
from becoming a spam-ridden, off-topic waste of time like the RAMVA
newsgroup has become will be a serious challenge, and one I hope you all are
up for. We owe the retiring guard a huge debt of gratitude, and we now have
the opportunity to support the list as we should have been all along.
