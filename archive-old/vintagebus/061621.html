Subject: RE: por-15 on rims

Was said:
&gt;I'm getting ready to replace the 14 inch rims on my
&gt;'60 panel with the correct (and hopefully gear-ratio
&gt;increasing) 15 inchers. The new wheels are rather
&gt;rusty and need some dents banged out of the rims. This
&gt;is a daily driver, and doesn't have to be real pretty.
&gt;So I was thinking about saving some dough, and instead
&gt;of blasting them, just sand them up a bit to get the
&gt;real lose shit off, and brushing on some POR-15, then
&gt;some cheap spraypaint on top of that. Is there
&gt;anything in this plan that screams out as a really
&gt;really bad idea? Thanks for any advice...
Be careful on fixing dented wheels. Out of round or out of true will eat up
tires fast.
For paint I used Rustoulem Appliance Epoxy on the 65 Westy bumpers and
wheels and am very pleased with the results. Fairly durable and easy to find
touch up paint. I made one of those spray rings that sit on the rim of the
tire and protect it from paint. 3 years and 8000 miles later they still look
good.
