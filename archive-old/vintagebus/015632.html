I'm finally getting down to action on the '65 I acquired this past January.
The PO had cut a cheesy plastic vent/sunroof into the the bus.  They did a
pretty crude job; almost looks like they used some type of metal shears and
werent' too careful.  At any rate, I'm left with a hole in my roof.  Are
there any decent after market sunroof kits available?  Or would I be better
off just finding a roof section and welding the hole closed? This bus is
prety much a beater, but I still love it and would like to mke it as tight
as possible.  Any sugecstions would be greatly appreciated!
