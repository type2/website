Subject: Splitty featured on Travel Channel

Last night I happened to watch the Travel Channel for a while, and 
out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a splitty in a commercial.  I 
hadn't been paying close attention to the commercial, but a few 
minutes later, the same commercial came up again.

There is a new program that premiers on Wednesday November 8, about a 
guy traveling around Italy.  He appears to be driving a royal blue 
split window, and I *think* it might be a Deluxe with 
skylights.  (The bus was only shown for a second or so in the commercial.)

The name of the program is &quot;Jamie Oliver's Great Italian Escape&quot;.  It 
comes on Wednesday night at 8:00 Eastern &amp; Pacific, and 7:00 
Central.  I'm not sure what the time is for Mountain &amp; other time zones.

 From looking at the Travel Channel TV listings, it appears that the 
program will air two or three times per week, with quite a few 
different episodes.

Here are some links.

Search results for &quot;Jamie Oliver&quot;, which shows a lot of program dates:
