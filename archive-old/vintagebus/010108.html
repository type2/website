First Trip report!
    Unfortunately we had to take the trip in my buddy's Jetta since my bus
is in the states, but we made the 4 hour trip from Kaiserslautern to Hanover
with no troubles. It wasn't clear where the show was going to be, but to
make it short we arrived at the campsite 2 hours later:)
We got there around 8pm Friday and people were still arriving. Couldn't find
anyone running the show so we set up camp and took in the sites and
festivities, figuring we could check in the next morning...
    The majority of busses were splitties... a guesstimation of 50-70! Some
notables: two Australian busses (with the vents above the beltline). One of
the owners was from England. He just bought it (lhd13 window) a few hours
before he set out on the journey by himself! The other one was a panel
andhad Australian plates... VERY rough. It was a panel that looked like it
had been rolled! There was a hearse converted from a double cab that was
rough also. The engine hatch was lower somehow with the bumper cut and
mounted onto the hatch! very cool.  A very nice 23 with a beautiful tow
along camper painted like the bus (chestnut brown &amp; red on bottom).  Saw no
less than four sliding door splitties, seven fire trucks, three ambulances,
five barndoors, a singe cab conversion that was stretched with a huge 'box'
on the back made into a camper. I seen one of these at VW Euro last year,
the owner said it was an authorized conversion of some sort. Alot of busses
from the Split Screen Van Club in England. There was a stretched bus that
looked exactly like the red &amp; black one with polished Porsche wheels and
chrome pop-outs from the states. There was a single cab with a tilt bed, an
orange and green single cab with 'Florida boy orange' painted on it with
some sort of pole to hang things in the bed (seen it somewhere before). A
panel with all sorts of circus propaganda on it. Looked very nice. Two
high-roof's. The original 'concept' the workers used in the factory was
there giving all the kids rides.
    Caught the action (about 13 minutes worth) on the cam-corder! Copies
could be available, if requested -- price of a tape + shipping, or send me
one. Just keep in mind we're moving soon, so it might take a while.
All in all a good showing, but no organization. Just a bunch of bus people
camping out. Not much swapmeet action, but did find a decent set of Euro
headlights complete with bulbs and connectors for $20.
Decided to make the hour drive to Wolfsburg and check out the museum before
we headed home. MY OH MY how things have changed! They have built a
multi-million dollar complex with pavilions for Bentley, Lamborghini, Seat,
Skoda, Audi, and Volkswagens. A five story building to house the museum, A
building with all sorts of interactive displays and like five restaurants,
two HUGE towers for cars recently built that hold 400 cars each, And a
building where you can pick up your new car. They spared no expense on this
place. They even built a Ritz- Carrolton Hotel in the same complex! Easy to
spend a whole day there, plenty of stuff for the kiddies too:)
We left around 8:30 to head home, finally got in at 1:30... Long but
exciting weekend!

Thanks for listening. I'll be moving back to states in TWO weeks!!! WOO
HOO!! finally be driving my baby again!
