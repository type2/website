Hey Sarah:
(I'm not sure if you got my last message as it was misaddressed)
I met a guy while I was in Monterey last month who is really into
campers of your vintage.
I hae his card at home, I will email you with the contact information
tomorrow. He has two or three and I'm sure he can recommend someone for
you.
Also, try the typeII mailing list for more help.
-John
