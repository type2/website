&lt;&lt; my questions are why would a rod bearing freeze and not the mains? (this 
is my ignorance showing through here)&gt;&gt;
Hi Samantha,
If you are not using a doghouse cooler system, but the earlier cooler.  This 
results in #4, &amp; 3 cylinders running hotter than the other two.  Plus # 3 
never gets quite as much air flow as #4 cylinder.  So with # 3 running hotter 
it tends to detonate sooner than the rest of the cylinders, this is why 
almost all distributors for the AC VW have the lobe that the points rides on 
for #3 slightly offset so this cylinder is ignited 2-3 degrees later than the 
rest are set for.  Still with this cylinder retarded it still runs hotter, 
and if you run the engine up to RPMs were it has trouble shedding the heat it 
can result in this area of the engine loosing lubrication due to it being too 
hot for the oil to lubricate properly.  In otherwords the hotter the thinner 
the oil gets.  So this can result in bearing failure suddenly, or over time 
resulting in a engine that should have gone 80,000+ miles to less than 
40,000miles.  Also if the main bearings are not in good shape the rod 
bearings get less, and less oil pressure due to bigger, and bigger 
diamensions in the main bearings.  When you get the rods off you will be able 
to see that the oil to the rod bearings get there through drilled passage 
ways through the crankshaft itself to the rod bearings.

&lt;&lt;  and, why wont the damned rods come off? &gt;&gt;
Because you need to reinstall the nuts so the studs are not quite though the 
nuts, and very lightly tap on the nuts to loosen the rods from the slight 
press fit studs.
