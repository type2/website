Subject: Smoke from directionals

By that I mean, &quot;turn signals.&quot;

Goin' around a corner one day, usin' the directionals like I always do
(another leftwingcommiepinko concept), boom.

Suddenly there's that wonderfully attention-getting eletrical smell.
Nanoseconds later, I notice the smoke spewing out of the directional housing
of my '67.

I pulled over immediately, the left blinker still blinking even though the
lever was in the center position, and doused the thing with a couple of
shots of well-aimed fire extinguisher. (Yes, folks, a nice thing to have).

Fire went out. Bus started up. I drove it home.

I disassembled the housing: one wire is fried. As a temporary measure, prior
to consulting this group, I taped everything off and now I'm using hand
signals to change lanes ( trouble is, nobody under 30 seems to know what
they mean &lt;Right turn = hey i think that guy just flipped me off&gt;) until I
get some more information.

Thus, my petition to this mostly austere group:

I reasonably believe the short to be localized with the chaffed wires inside
the housing on the steering column, and I'm just going to replace the wiring
in the housing itself, which was constantly sliding down the column no
matter how tightly it affixed. In this scenario, how likely / unlikely would
it be that anything else has been affected (I&quot;m asking because I have an
offer from a professional who, sight unseen, indicates that the entire
wiring network must be replaced -- yet I have experienced no other
prolbems).

But, I'm not Svengali, whoever that was, and I appreciate the profit motive
as much as the next guy, but I'd much prefer to get some insight from this
group first before I proceed in either direction..

Thanks, everyone.

Craig.
