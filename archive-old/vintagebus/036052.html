 I have a '62 panel van that needs to be a daily driver at freeway 
 speeds  (65 mph - 70 mph).  I know that &quot;freeway&quot; trannies are 
 available for bugs,  but are they available for busses?  &gt;&gt;

     I am getting such a thingy for my 65 camper- a tranny with a 
 3.875 ring  and pinion, and the 46mm rear axle boxes which have 
 1.26 reduction gears.   Todd may write and  mention how it needs 
 parts from a number of trannys to  make it, and so it  costs more 
 than a regular rebuild. &gt;&gt;

Righto!  Usually between 3 and 4 trans cores to cobble together
all the required parts.  You'll end up around 65 mph for 3500 rpm
depending on  tires with the 1.26s.  Less speed for the 1.39s that
come on the '62s.
