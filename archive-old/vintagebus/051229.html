&lt;&lt; I am considering buying a full length industrial roof rack tomorrow. How 
do I tell if it is for a early or late model. The zvw tag is no longer 
legible. I have seen racks that have the straight side bars on the front, but 
this rack has them on the side with the bent side bars facing forward. I hope 
this makes sense. It does not have the horseshoe style clamps it has clamps 
that are about 2&quot; wide and 6&quot; long that go from the gutter to the threaded 
rod mounted on the rack. It is similar to the rack on this green bus(almost a 
burn victim). http://vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/3375.JPG
  &gt;&gt;
the rack on that bus looks like what I have on my 61.  I can put 4x8 sheets 
of plywood on my 61.  there are 2 length wise reinforcements that run the 
front to back direction.  I am told it is a 70s era rack.  I slightly damaged 
it (cracked some welds)  hauling bus nose to metal divider on it back for a 
junkyard 250 miles.   sticker says its rated for 300lbs or something like 
that.

THe rack on my 65 is a bit shorter, can't fits those 4x8 sheets in it, but it 
has more front to back reinforcements, and is sturdier.  I am told it is 60s, 
and it is what I call 'industrial.

there is another kind I have seen with no front to back tubes(except the 
edges) and those tend to sag in the crossbars, hear they are 50s.
