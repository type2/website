I am in the beginning stage of doing work of the front of my 66 westy like 
most I have the problem of drifting on the highway from lane to lane anyway 
I was talking to some bug fok, they claim there is an adjusting bolt on the 
box. ?? They claim I should crank down on it if I'm having a problem with 
the box.  Does this make any sence to anybody
