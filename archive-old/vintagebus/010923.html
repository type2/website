I seed racks mounted on the decklid. =)
Sometimes racks mount inside or in the closet (like in an airplane) =)
Sometimes they even mount using a trailer hitch as a holder. =)
Some of em bolt to the bumpers. =)
How about bolting it to the nose?  =)

&lt;&lt; VERY RARE ROOF MOUNTED  LUGGAGE RACK. &quot; &gt;&gt;

This would be as opposed to the belly mounted luggage rack I guess?  I 
thought all luggage racks were roof mounted.  Guess I just haven't been into 
classic cars long enough.  8-)
