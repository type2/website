Have you all already seen the article in the October issue of the
British mag VolksWorld about the Jess's hearse? I was so surprised to
turn the page and see it there! Geez, these two and their busses are
FAMOUS! ;-) It's very cool to be able to communicate thru the list
with people like them and all of you with so much experience and
enthusiasm.  It makes it feel like we have celebrities in our midst!
:-) Hopefully one day I'll make it over there to where you Aridzona
folks are and meet some of the members of the BIGGEST VW Club in the
world (isn't that what the article in Hot VW's said?) You guys are
awesome!!! Keep on bussin!
