Subject: RE: [VB] Tent question

Hi Tim,
It seems that almost any Westy/Sundial tent that you could use would require
that you attach some brackets to the roof of your bus.  Most people with
campers drill holes in their roof, (or their campers came that way), to
attach the mounting brackets which in turn attaches the tent to your bus.

I have a 67 Sundial, and I acquired a tent awhile after I already had the
bus.  Rather than drilling holes in the top to attach the Sundial tent, I
got a full-length roof rack, and attached the brackets to the bottom rung on
the roof rack.  It means that the tent is 2-3 inches higher off the ground,
but at least I didn't have to drill holes in my roof in order to attach the
tent.

The point that I'm grovelling towards, is that I think it would be a shame
to drill holes in a 21 window in order to attach tent brackets.  In fact,
with your skylight windows, you may not be able to.

If I were you, and especially if you don't care about OG stuff, I'd wait
until my local sporting goods/Target/Walmart had a sale on camping goods,
and I'd buy the best free-standing tent that I could afford.

Just my opinion though.

Good luck,
Ed Richardson
