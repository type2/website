I just got this from a guy who surfed onto my site.  He sent it in 2 emails
so below are both mails.  Have at it.
=====================================
NQ - I was surfin' and ran onto your site - great site. I need to ask for
your advice as to where and what site would be best for me to offer for sale
my '67 13 window Deluxe Bus. I have not advertised it here in San Antonio
yet due to another ad scheduled to run in the EDITION 93 of the Vochomania&quot;
magazine out of Mexico and is circulated throughout Central/South America
and Spain. I'll have to go into my e-mail files and send you a description.
As you will se I have it 95+% totally restored, but due to 2 heart attacks
my involvement has been limited and I want someone to have and that will
appreciate the bus. Your reply will be appreciated. R. Burns (Bob)

NQ - below is the ad information for my bus. Your reply will be
appreciated-Thank you,Bob
NQ - below is the description of my bus that I had e-mailed you separately.
Again...your reply will be appreciated. Thank you,

ATTN: Mr. Marlos E. Bureau (Revista Vochomania) - my friend here in San
Antonio, Enrique Flores, gave me your e-mail address. I have a 1967 VW 13
window deluxe bus that I would like to advertise in your magazine. I will
give you the details as follow and will scan and e-mail to you Polaroid
photos or FedEx the photos to you upon your reply to your address which I
would apprecite to be in your reply.
The details of the bus are: Totally restored, rebuilt 1600cc German block
engine, just tuned, new plugs, wires, battery(Sears Die Hard) new voltage
regulator, belt, gas filters, air filter and an extra tranny comes with it
along with two boxes of parts and accessories.The new brakes were $495.00.
Custom paint (apple red and cream plus a box of touch up paint if ever
necessary), the body has been Butter Waxed twice for hardness and shine,
custom VW tan vinyl interior, custom fit into the dash without cutting is a
SONY AM/FM stero cassette with dual speakers and an extra set of rear
speakers is in the box of parts, even the 34 year old clock works perfectly,
I installed a cigar lighter for the 12V extra air circulation fan and to
charge a cell telephone, gasoline gauge, oil temp and pressure gauges,
everything electrical works - I spent $350.00 and 20 man hours to straighten
all of the electrical system to be correct, all new rubber - floor mats and
windows(48 man hours to install the 3 sets of rubbers on each pop out
window, new wsw tires-less than 1,000 miles, even the wheels have all new
clips to hold on the hub caps. Everything is new and has been completed
within the past year..muffler and exhaust, shocks, speedometer cable, the
body is rust free (there is only one place on the side that had to be cut
out and replace to rid the only cancer it had and it is about the size of a
coffee cup and is not visible  unless it is pointed out, the body has no
rattles and is as sound as brand new. The new interior has foam insulation
behind the wood panels to insulate and lessen noise - I am the 3rd owner and
the bus was an original Oklahoma owner which the title will show.  I am
asking $8,750.00 (neg.) F.O.B. San Antonio; however for a fee of $100.00 I
will deliver to Laredo, Texas. I have driven the bus to Laredo round trip
twice and used less than a pint of oil and got 33 mpg at 55 and 60 mph which
it will drive all day, everyday and anywhere.
There are only 2 items not completed - (1) the windshield washer bottle and
lines, but I have tried every possible way to get one, but without success
and to find a used one that is not cracked is impossible. (2) the back up
lights work, but the tranny does not have a switch to connect them - wires
are in place
Additionally, I have custom designed signs on each side that are 47&quot; wide
and 52&quot; high and in the rear window - all of which are removable. This was
done for attractive and effective advertising of any business, only to
repaint the message of the new owner -and I have left the cargo area open to
allow the new owner to install seats to be a regular bus -or- leave open for
cargo -or- install a camper kit -otherwise it is 100%.
Please reply as to how is the best way for me to get the photos to you and
what is the charges and sizes of advertising in your magazine. My address is
5227 Ashton Audrey, San Antonio, TX 78249, my telephone no. is (210)
699-3472 / fax no. (210) 697-7134 Thank you, Robert E. Burns
