Subject: Re: [VB] Brake MC clarification?

I have the Wolfgang adaptor in my '66.

Works well for a cheap Bay MC conversion.  Does not fit a German bay MC.  
Wolfgang was notified of this over a year ago so maybe this has been 
corrected in the machining process?

If you have a pure drum setup this conversion is not the best idea as the 
rears lock before the front.  In my case I have 944 discs up front and the 
rears are still a little grabby (nit pick).  People really need to add the 
rear proportioning valve that is in the bays so the rears are better 
modulated when the bus weight transfers in a hard stop.

Good luck,
Adrian Pillow
