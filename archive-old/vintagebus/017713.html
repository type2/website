Subject: Bang! Whuppa-whuppa-whuppa

Hmm, what's that sound?

I was driving the 66 at city speeds, everything was dinw, and then &quot;Bang!&quot;
from the back end, followed by an ominous whuppa-whuppa-whuppa noise.
Intrigued and terrified and thinking perhaps I'd blown a tyre, I pulled
over. Everything looked normal.  Start it up, get on my way, and still
'whuppa-whuppa-whuppa' (I think the 'bang' part was an overture to the
'whuppas')  I can't figure this one out.  It *sounds* like it's coming from
the DS rear.  It's not an engine thing (near as I can tell) becasue the
noise doesn't occur when idling or revving the engine.  Im pretty sure it's
not a clutch thing, because the cluth catches great, as usual, and all the
gears engage fine.  I pulled rear drums, and the brakes are fine.  Which
leaves the question of tranny trouble, BUT: all gears, incl. reverse
function fine, the van pulls fine, everything is normal but for this noise.
It seems to clatter a bit more when I put the clutch in whilst driving, but
this may sound different because the engine's quieter.  Also, the frequency
of the clattering increases with speed.  There is no tranny fluid leaking, BTW.

I have a 66 bus with a DP 1600.  Axle bolts are 36mm, which means it's from
an earlier vehicle (right?).

Any ideas?  Should I be driving the bus?  The nearest shop I trust for
diagnosis of this is 60km away in another city, but I'm not too keen to have
it out even on the back roads.  I would like to get this fixed so I can
enjoy my bus for what's left of this dismal summer.

Thanks,

Kev
