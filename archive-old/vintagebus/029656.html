Subject: oil cooler oddity?

I recently got a little stash of parts from a friend of mine... included
in it was a doghouse style oil cooler (not a type4 cooler though) that
has the oil pressure switch right on the actual oil cooler.  It came off
of a short lived high performance engine that was in a type3.  I got the
heads, some tin, and the oil cooler.  I got the lower cylinder tin (aka
cool tin) and plan on giving this stuff a shot.
What would that oil cooler be from?  When/why/how was it used?

Thanks!
