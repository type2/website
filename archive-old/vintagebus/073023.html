Thanks so much E&amp;B. That's the info I needed, but sor some reason had
a bugger of a time finding it (actually I never found it). Now that I
know where can info like this be found. I looked in the WOG images in
the obselete docs but never came across this. I'd love to have access
to a reference for items like this.
