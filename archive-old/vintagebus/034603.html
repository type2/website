&lt;&lt; The reamer that a person uses when you installing the swing level pin and 
 bushings, how does this work? do you use hand power or a drill?&gt;&gt;
Hand power just like the one shown in the bus shop manual for doing the king 
pins.

&lt;&lt;Could you use a wheel cylinder honer instead? &gt;&gt;
Not really a good idea.  Brass, and bronze tend to clog up the honing stones 
taking far longer to do the work than steel or iron that they were designed 
for.  Even more importantly the proper reamer is supposed to have a centering 
end device to align both bushings to each other when you ream them!
