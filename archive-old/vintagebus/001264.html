Subject: Re: [VB] repop safaris

Bunch of people said:
&gt; huge safaris are kewl rant &lt;
&gt;
What's the allure of safari windows anyway?  You'd think that all the talk of they leak, repros are crap, originals are too much $$$ would just turn people off.  

Of course, I've never ridden in a Bus with them open so maybe I'm missing something...
