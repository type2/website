&gt; Geez! No need for the &quot;newbie&quot; flame! Excuse me for my free speech opinion!
&gt; Yes, I DID check out the VWWO site AND bookstore and thought it would be
&gt; nice to buy a book I would have bought elsewhere to help you guys out and
&gt; I'm NOT EVEN CLOSE TO OREGON!!! Now I'm not only sorry I dared to share my
&gt; opinion as a newbie, but I'm also sorry I helped out the club of someone so
&gt; quick to lash out at me for not knowing EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING!!!

Thanks for buying a book. 
But we have gone through this before, and if people insist on making Bob
defend his right to his own property, we will lose the sermons.  I was
attempting to squelch the discussion before it got ugly again. 

What that felllow wants to do is theft, plain and simple. Bob has asked
him not to. What else needs to be said? 

By the way, I am me, and the club I belong to is the club I belong to. I
am not the club, and it is not me. I hope you hold what I have said
against me, and not the club. I am also a member of NEATO, LiMBO, BPA,
Vintage VW Association, and GASS.  I hope you don't hold anything I say
against any of them either.
