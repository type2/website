Subject: Oil bath airfilters for dual carbs

I have a pair of dual carbs that I'm putting fitting to the 1600 dp in
my d cab (off a limited edition Beetle sold in South Africa only). I
would like to use a pair of the HD filters recently discussed on the
list (cyclone topic). These are approx 12 inch long canisters with a
dome on each end. 

Now for the qustion: Can an oil bath filter be too big for a particular
application? I think this might be possible as the oil bath filter
relies in part on high speed air flow to smash dust particles into the
oil at the bottom of the canister. Since I will  only be sucking in half
of the original air per filter could it be going too slowly to filter
effectively?
