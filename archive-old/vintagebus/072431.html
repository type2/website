It's been 3 years at least since I have been called an A-hole on the list! 

 I am far from a conservative, not that i really need to make that clear as I wouldn't be embarrassed either way but it's obvious that the humor and sarcasm in my post's was altogether missed and apparently upset at least one of my fellow proud Liberal list members. This A-hole's moving on to the next thread.
