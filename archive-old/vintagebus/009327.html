I  JUST came home from decorating 2 vehicles, a entire day spent taping and
bungeeing lights!
 alot like a VW bus,,
I agree with Dave,  As I have done this and it works at hwy speeds

Easily done- use an inverter and any regular 110 V x-mas lites you choose.
or a generator
use clear package tape on the wire and on the bulbs to hold them down.
make sure to fold over the tape a little so it is easy to grab to take off,
&gt;make sure to apply the tape to a dry surface. maybe there are other better
&gt;types of tape that won't damage the paint, e.g. electrical tape ( comes in
&gt;colors, do a candy cane install.
I have 100 feet of nighttime parade vehicles to tend to Sat night!
HoHoHoHo!

&gt;&gt;Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?  I would
&gt;&gt;love to install some this season and maybe put together a Christmas light
&gt;&gt;cruise.
