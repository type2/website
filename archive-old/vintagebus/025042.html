Subject: castle nuts/ knock-off wrenches...( re-send)
Message-ID: &lt;371295F4.2E4_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

What is the collective wisdom on the knock-off wrenches for the rear
axle nut? You know, the ones that you hit with a small sledge to turn? I
carry one in my road kit, since I don't carry an impact gun. But given
the choice I use a socket and impact.

Do the knock-off wrenches cause problems if used exclusively?
(I've never had any problems with them, but again, use them only when
absolutely necessary)
