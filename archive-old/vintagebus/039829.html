Thanks.  The bus is in an advanced state of disassembly so no prob with 
daily driving there and I have committed myself to finishing this correctly 
rather than being in a rush (we all know that part of us that begs to 
drive).  The glass to frame seals look pretty poor however and are in need 
servicing.  I learned in my younger years  not to be impatient.  Indeed, 
sounds as though this job would lend itself to a longer process and allow me 
to recover from the 64-Sunroof bug I am building for my youngest to 
use/learn with (many thxs to Thom Fitzgerald and Thom Mink for their 
unfailing support and infinite patience).

I will take an example from another listee and fill a large tray with some 
kerosene and start one or more of these to soaking til XMas.  Then I can 
have a project over the Holidays !!
