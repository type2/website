The Westy just seems to crawl towards &quot;completion&quot; and I'm both excited and
frustrated...the usual thing (at least for me): finding more and more rust.
The body itself is in better shape than any of the buses I have owned.  The 
Kombi had rust, but it was covered with fiberglass, bondo, and riveted 
panels.  The '62...well, let's just say the old '62 I _gave away_ had some
issues with rust.

I think that at Buses By the Beach this year I won't get the ugliest bus
trophy like I did the last time :-)

After this weekend, the wiring is finally DONE.  It took forever.
Statistically I visited at least 1/3 of all the connection points with the
soldering iron, and more than that actually needed some kind of attention.
I have a few unterminated wires in the engine compartment, but I know what they
do, and I'm just waiting to put the engine in to see how much extra wire I'll
need to run.  There are no more (that I can find!  ;-)) PO wiring hacks in my
bus.  In retrospect, a new harness wouldn't have been a _bad_ idea, but this
one was definitely saveable, so I'm glad y'all talked me out of it :-)  Of
particular usefulness in resolving the spaghetti problem were Matt Roberd's
9-prong box howto (bad box + bad signal switch) and the color wiring diagram
from Thom's site.  And solder.  Lots of solder.  

She blinks, beeps, and illuminates in all the right places!

I put the front bumper back too, that was fun.  It involved a mini-sledge,
vice grips, and three attempts.  The bumper had been involved in a minor 
collision at some point, which tweaked the little nub on the passenger's side
dogleg and twisted the bumper up so it blocked the door.  Turns out the blade
is quite straight, but I had to straighten the nub and the pass. side bracket.
If you stare at it you can see that it isn't perfectly level, but it's not
obvious, and both the doors open.  The second time I did it, the pass. door
opened but the driver's door was blocked!

The gas tank is sealed.  As soon as I get finished cleaning the engine 
compartment (one try was not enough!) it'll go back in.  I used the POR-15
stuff Dave E. loaned me.  Sealing the tank hardly diminished the sealer, and 
I got it pretty good in there judging by flashlight inspection.  I'm thinking
of not running one of those el-cheapo in-line filters, although I'll probably
use one for the first few thousand miles just in case.

I still need to do the brakes, put the wiper motor back together, and install
the transaxle and engine.  I've decided to put the oil filter underneath the 
bus 'cuz there won't be any holes to make for hoses that way, it'll keep the
heat from the filter out of the engine compartment, etc.  

I enjoy working on my bus, but I'm really looking forward to driving it for
the first time :-)  My goal is to make the Peach State Transporters meeting
in it on April 4...that may be cutting it a little close, but I'll definitely
make the Jax Beach show!
