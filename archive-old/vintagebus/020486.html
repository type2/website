Subject: Free lunch?
To: Bus List &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Somebody said there's no such thing as a free lunch,
but it's not true!  At Busses and Balloons V here in
Albuquerque this October 6th, one of our sponsors,
Foreign Aide, is giving a free lunch w/ a Southwestern
flair to anyone attending the show!

How much better can it get, Balloons, Busses, and free
food?  And if Ronnie and John come from Havasu,
there'll probably be a free taco or two for the
campers Friday night!

Check it out at http://onearth_dot_com/2001show/ and make
your plans to attend.
