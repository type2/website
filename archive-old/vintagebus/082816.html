Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch cable

It is normal to have to adjust the clutch after replacing it.
 
But if the pedal does not spring all the way up, either the spring is  
gone/broken/not in place right... look at the clutch arm out the side of the  
transmission... there is a spring around the arm...  the arm the clutch  able goes 
through.
 
but usually what happens is the clutch pedal pivoting getting rusty/crudded  
up.   then you need to remove the pedal from the arm under neath (13mm  nut 
and bolt) and then remove the clutch pivot... think a large bolt is under  then, 
clean it up, apply fresh clean grease, and reinstall.

you might want to do the brake pedal pivot too.

I  replaced my clutch recently, 

and now the clutch wasn't taking at the  right place,

it seemed to &quot;fall&quot; off the Clutch pedal( it used to take  low down on the
pedal, 

and now it was at the very top, the engine  was revving whilst in gear) , 

So I made the cable shorter to try and  fix this problem, but now

The clutch pedal comes up, and I have to  assisted with my foot to help is to
the top, 

I Think It might be  springs or something, Please Help
