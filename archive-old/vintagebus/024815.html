Subject: what do I do ?
Message-ID: &lt;36EAFC87.27FD_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

Having now found a new ('63) body for my crashed '67, I am a little
uncertain which approach to take.
The '67 was pretty much completely rebuilt just before I crashed it, and
all the mechanicals are still spot on except the broken trans casing.
The '63 has a straight body but has a few problem areas of rust. Some of
these being the floor and a couple of little spots in the chassis.
The floor and chassis of the crashed '67 are still in really good
condition and still has all the running gear in place.
SO WHAT DO I DO ? 
Do I seperate the body from the rusty '63 floor/chassis/running gear and
swap it with the buckled body of the '67 using the still good
floor/chassis/etc. so as to effectively have the good body on the good
chassis OR
Do I fix all the rust holes in the body of the '63 and then set about
repairing or replacing the floor and then rebuilding the chassis and
running gear effectively rebuilding the whole car?
Is it easy enough just to take one body off and swap it for another?
Will the '63 body go on the '67 floor/chassis?
Does the floor/chassis of a type2 separate from the body the same way a
beetle does?
Either way, I will have some original '67 parts left over when I'm
finished including a complete set of glass (already tinted) if anyone is
interested!
Thanks for all ideas/input/expertise
Daniel
