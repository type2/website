&lt;&lt; Found a bus the other day with a rear door(hatch) that is hinged at the
 bottom with no rear window opening. Was this setup specific to the
 ambulance or were there other variants with the same?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Well the problem is that you could order almost any strange option for your
bus.  So it could have been anything from the description.

&lt;&lt; The interior was stripped and the panel where I had hoped to find the
 ambulance fans was missing. Are there any other clues as to whether it
 was an ambulance or not.&gt;&gt;
If it is a 1964 or later the second number of the chassi # will tell you.

 &lt;&lt;Reason I want to know is that I believe that ambulances had a close
 ratio gearbox(smaller gap between 2nd an 3rd gear) and a taller overall
 ratio. Does anyone know if this is true? If it is I would like to take
 the tranny out and use it in my doublecab.  &gt;&gt;
Do not know, and would not bet on it after all this time.  It probably was
replaced since new, but would be very interesting to hear how it tachs out.
