Sounds like the all talk and no walk might be more in *your* court eh?  8-)  
If you are not serious about selling it, don't put the ad out.  
 
&lt;&lt; im soooo torn.  im sure im going to regret either decision that i make,
 but before i make it, i would really apreciate any/all input from those
 of you that have sold buses that you really cared about. &gt;&gt;

 As far as Japn, a collector is a collector.  The bus will be out of your 
hands wether it goes to Montanta or Japan or wherever.  I think the absolute 
worst would be to sell it locally and watch it get torn up by the new owner.  
At least by selling it at a high price you have some assurances it will be 
taken care of.  Most of the time folks with money didn't get there by buying 
expesive things and tearing them up.  They take care of their posessions.
