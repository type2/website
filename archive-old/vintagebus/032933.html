shows a D+ terminal and a DF terminal on the generator.  Mine, however, has a 
B+ terminal and a D+ terminal.  This B+ doesn't come straight off the battery 
does it?!  And what should I do about the non-existant DF terminal?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Wes,
Sounds like your B+ termainal on your generator is the same as the DF.  One 
wire from each of these goes to seperate terminals on the regulator.  Then 
there should be a small blue wire going from the other side of the regulator 
to the generator idiot light and a large red wire going to the starter 
teminal to where the postive cable from the battery connects also!   Eric&amp;Barb
