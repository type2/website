Subject: (bad leak) too much oil?

I got my 67 bus (H case 1500 all-stock i.e. no
sump,filter etc.) tuned at the local aircooled shop 2
weeks ago.
A reputable place.
Drove it 90 miles total to OCTO and back, that's it.
Looked outside the other day and there's an oil
puddle, looks like about 12 to 16 FL. oz. of oil,
leaked enough to make about a 10-inch wide stain, and
run about 2-feet down the drive way. It looks like
it's leaking from between the engine and tranny. I
smelled it, it smells more like engine than tranny
oil, so I checked the dipstick and the oil line is
about 1/2 inch above the top (second) line on the
dipstick. 
Is that too much oil? How would that happpen? And do
you think it resulted in the blown main seal?
Should I be pointing fingers, or writing checks?

Jason
