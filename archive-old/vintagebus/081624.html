Subject: Re: [T2] We need money

OK - I'm sending in a donation (maybe that is the wrong word).  I've
mentioned this before ... why don't we have say ... ball hats type2_dot_com - or
vintagebus_dot_com ... or sell that bumper sticker ... 36 HP Please just pass -
type2_dot_com - etc.. I'm sure guys like busdepot or type2parts could sell it
and donate the profits to the list ... then the list could be self
supporting.  Clearly - guys like busdepot get great benefits in terms of
advertising their stuff - and I'm sure they make healthy donations as well -
but still - I would love to buy a few of those old bumperstickers ... I'd
pay $10 or $20 for each ... I'd happily over pay if I was supporting the
list.

Anyway - I'm sending a donation and thanks to all the list admin guys for
their hard work.
