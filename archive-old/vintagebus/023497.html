Subject: Turn Signal Switch compatible?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey guys----
I've got a 59' panel. I have a nice later style (66?) turn signal switch that 
controls the high beams on it. I am wondering if i can use this switch on the 
59' for the turn signals while keeping the foot operated high beams? Which 
wires would I have to disengage or not use from the switch?
I appreciate any help? 

Thanx a bunch--
Pete
