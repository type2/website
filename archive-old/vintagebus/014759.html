oh my brakes work fine as long as i keep filling up
the resivoir. as far as more important things, i'm
just getting on my feet here in nashville. i have to
use all my money on rent for a while and then go from
there. one step at a time. as far as insurance, i do
have sone for about a month based out of minnesota,
but i want to transferit to down here. my work is far
enough away where i can walk if i need to. so if my
brakes do get too bad, it's not that big of a deal. i
don't really have a choice in the matter, but it's all
working out. by the grace of God.

&gt; Driving a bus with random
&gt; brakes is bad enough but a bus with random brakes
&gt; and no insurance. WOW!
&gt; When you say you have things more important than the
&gt; brakes to take care of
&gt; I hope you mean like open heart surgery or something
&gt; like that. Remember
&gt; things that make a bus stop are more important than
&gt; things that make a bus
&gt; go. And try and save up for some insurance. I hate
&gt; the big corporations as
&gt; much as the next guy but it is where we are at as a
&gt; society. If you take
&gt; some one out when your brakes go again you can mess
&gt; up their life and yours
&gt; for a long time coming.
&gt; Good luck my bus brother may the force be with you
&gt; (you are going to need it).
