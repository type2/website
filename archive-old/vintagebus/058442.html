Subject: Tie fighters are back!

Driving around in the red 61 veedoubleyew microbus through the snow.  The 6V 
wiper motor with the voltage drop is noisy, wree - ehhhrrnn wrreee - ehrrnn 
wreee - eerrnnnhh.  The snow swirls around like tie fighters attacking the 
death star.  The miniscule tiefighters are dissolve soon after they hit the 
glass, and are schwooped away by the mighty wipers.  vreeeee - errrhhhnn  
vrrreee -erhnrnn  vrree-errhhnn.   They attack from many directions at once.  
some straight down, some from the side, some flee when they see the fearsome 
VW.   Most curve down from up and above.  The wiper motor speeds up the 
longer I drive. Vree-ern vree-ern vree-ern.   The feeble heater does not do 
much in this bus, and the drafts are unplugged.  I wear gloves, hat, scarf, 
coat, in the middle of March.   Needs Eberspacher, will try to fix and 
install it soon.    The new antenna gives great radio reception, but 
sometimes I just like to listen to the bus.     The headlights are bright, 
the horn is loud, the brakes stop it well, and the motors purrs.   Why drive 
anything but a splitty?
