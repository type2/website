Hi All,

On the passenger side of my double cab pop out window, I am missing the
piece that sets inside the pillar that the window latch screws into...
Actually, it looks like something happened and the PO used some large screw
to attach the latch to the body so it's kinda messed up but repairable
except the machined piece is missing.

So, how does go about fixing this????  Can you get a replacement part and
slide it up into possition?
Does anybody have one???
The truck is going to the paint show this weekend and I'm desparate.
Anybody want to make some quick $$$?

Thanks
David

'59 double cab.
