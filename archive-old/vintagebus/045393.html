DKB is in the Tampa area, we just had a Gainesville mailing address while I 
temporarily lived up there.  Rex, if your friend is in to split buses, have 
him email me when he gets to town and we can set something up I am sure.  We 
have Bulli Brigade each November which is the largest split only show on the 
East side, so that is something to look forward to in addition to the 
numerous other shows that are coming up int he next few months around here.
