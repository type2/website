Subject: Freebie !!

Hey List,
A guy I know just came by the office and wanted to know if I was interested
in a '73 camper that his son-in-law-to-be wants to get rid of. I told him I
wasn't but I would try to help. I'm in Oklahoma but the bus is in Kansas
City. Anyway, according to the guy, the bus has no motor in it but the
interior is supposed to be in really good condition and complete. He said
there was a little rust on the front along the bottom of the windshield and
some on one of the doors. The bus is FREE for anyone that wants it. He would
like whoever gets it to promise him to restore it. Anyway, the guy is moving
to Maine and doesn't want to haul it with him. If anyone is interested,
e-mail me and I'll find out how to contact him.
