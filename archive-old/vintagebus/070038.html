Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Oil &amp; Cooling

  Thats why the big boy engine builders put squirters in their engines,

Not squirters, just notched rods in VWs. No big deal when you have the
set of rods in your hands out of the engine. A few passes with the corner
edge of a file and you got squirters.
