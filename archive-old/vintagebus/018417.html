back to the end-play shims....i think i understand where they should go.I
don't remember ever having seen them when taking my engine out(removing clutch
flywheel etc...) what are the side effects of running an engine without these
shims? is that possible, or would the engine not run at all? i'm wondering if
i just missed seeing them in my engine, or they aren't there at all and i am
causing engine damage with all my driving...

thanks

ps i have yet to see these end play shims in any of my exploded parts diagrams
that i have looked at.
