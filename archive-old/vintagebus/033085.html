Subject: Stealth Stereo Systems
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Someone had asked about onformation about a company that makes vintage stereo 
systems. I found this place today after watching some custom auto show on 
cable. http://customautosound_dot_com/Speakers.htm
Looks like they primarily do stuff with american hotrods and the other heavy 
metal cars. I have written them about a product that I found interesting 
enough to actually consider putting in my 67 Westy. Its a faceplate that 
folds horizontally flat and controls the cd jukebox by remote controls. So I 
thought, place this under my parcel tray, hide the cd jukebox and keep my 
original stock radio in the dash. Now where to hide the speakers.

Will find out more and pass it along.
