&gt; Mercedes made this bus-looking thing.  It used the exact same 
&gt; headlights.
&gt; I can't recall the model of this puppy, but it came in 
&gt; several different 
&gt; configurations.  I know of one in Sacramento that's like the &quot;deluxe&quot; 
&gt; version, complete with &quot;corner windows&quot;

The trucks I'm talking about are full size haulers and the light assemblies
have the adjusting screws and drain holes in the same place as buses. These
trucks were the last Mercs with a 'hood' if that makes any sense. Current
Mercs have a flat nose where the screen is flush with the bumper. They were
trucks in the 5 to 10 ton class and there are many still in service here in
South Africa. I'll see if I can get a current price and maybe a pic or two
for anyone that may be interested.

Later
