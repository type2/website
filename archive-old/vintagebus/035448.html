I should be going to pick up my bus in a week or so and I have a couple of
questions. I got a bus tow bar from the fellow in Arizona so I'm all set
there, I was wondering if there is a problem towing the bus at highway speeds
( 65-75). I don't know how the reduction boxes will act at that speed. As long
as the trans is in nuetral should there be any problems ? I have to pick the
bus up in Virginia and tow it back to Michigan ( 600-650 miles).

I wouldn't tow at that speed, as in case of an emergency situation it is much
harder to slow down and there is the danger of jacknifing.  I think many times
you see posted a slower limit for cars with trailers, for this reason.    As
long as the tranny is in neutral and the tires are good enough it should be
fine to tow.    A  loose steering in the bus will make it woggley back there
(I had this experience and was petrified when  my exBF and I towed a 66 100
miles, the steering was very bad and I was not happy with the handling,
particularly when the road was bad) so if you need to replace a tie rod you
may want to do that before the trip.   Towed a bug 500 miles with my 61 bus a
few years back, with a tow bar and lights hooked up on the bug, and it was
fine, just went slower than usual.  Better safe than sorry.
