Good afternoon list,

I took a ride in a bus with a split one third two thirds front seat
recently and it seemed to offer a bit more leg room when set all the way
back than the bench seat in my doublecab. The seat base also seemed to
be a bit lower thereby allowing me to see more of the view through the
screen and less of a view of the sun visor. When sitting in the bench
seat of my bus my eyeline is exactly at the level of the top of the
screen so I gotta kind of slouch to get a good view.

As I am not able to modify my physical dimensions I'm considering
swapping a split seat for my bench. I don't have my bus handy to check
but I seem to recall that the structure beneath the seats are the same
except for the rails that the split seat runs on. I think that the split
seat is a little narrower overall and if that's the case I'll be able to
use the extra space on either side to fit a pair of inertia reel seat
belts on either side.

Has anyone done this swap? If so please fill me in.

TIA

Michael
