Subject: Re: [VB] 40 Horse flywheel

If you have a stepped crank, you must use a stepped crank flywheel.   So 
first remove the flywheel and look to see if the crank is stepped or not.    
If it isn't, you can use a 12V o ring FW.  Then you can use a 12V starter.

If it is stepped, best to look for a large clutch stepped 6V FW. ( but the 
small clutch works too if you can't find the large clutch on, the large 
clutch j'll fit the 6V FW and will not wear out prematurely on 12V. 
Not sure if there are 12V large clutch stepped FWs.   

either way, might as well replace the main seal.

If you have a large clutch, you can just leave your later IRS tranny alone, 
and us ethe later kind of clutch on the engine.

&lt;&lt; I think i know the answer, but am posing the question just the same.
 Is there a way to make the 40 H a 12-volt ?
 I assume that if the crank is cut for a non o-ring flywheel , you are
 limited to the 6-volt 180mm flywheel and will just have to leave it
 and run the 6-volt starter at double speed on a 12-volt battery,
 since a 0-ring flywheel won't fit. Are there any 12-volt flywheels
 made to fit a non o-ring crank ?
 
 What is the correct arrangement of modifications
 to fit the later 12-volt IRS trans ?
 1. Remove the release bearing centering tube ?
 2. Change the clutch operating fork and use the early release bearing
     to match the 3-finger / 6-spring clutch cover ?
 3. Exchange the 12-volt starter bushing for the 6-volt adapter.
