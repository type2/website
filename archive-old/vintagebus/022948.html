I doubt that would be a reliable bus.  While it would be kewel to show off
for the kiddies, unless he's used to dinking with carbs on a regular basis...

If you're in Canada, safaris probably are not for you.  No safaris are rain
proof.  All the other stuff is kewel stuff for the kiddies, but like gramps
used to say, &quot;chrome don't get you home&quot;

That link is bogus, too.
