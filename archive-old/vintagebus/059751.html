Subject: RE: [VB] scary story. advice needed.

When this happened to Lind (poor guy, terrible loss), I checked all my
lugs. Almost everyone needed retorquing. I have made it a monthly
ritual, with the checking of the valves.
I'm using antiseize sparingly on lug bolts with all stock parts, wheels.
I think it's safe to say after each removal, a drive and then check
after some mileage is in order, and constantly looening ones receiving
new bolts/drums. Especially so after that nice powdercoated wheel goes
on, or new paint, with considerations to removing paint/poweder under
lug contact area.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rex,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I remember that story vividly... I just forgot how it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ended up! Thanks for your insight. I think we need a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;therapy group:) Check your lugs, check em twice! Cheers, Pete
