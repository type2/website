Subject: Re: [VB] buying parts for my 1776

&gt; hey all,
&gt;
&gt; still buying parts for the 1776 and wanted to know who has the best price
for
&gt; 90.5 mm pistons and jugs and also some scat lifters?  local shops here in
&gt; ohio are charging 205.99 for mahle 90.5 pistons it is unbelievable. I need
a
&gt; much better deal than that ? whos got the goods for good price ?

I dont think I'd worry so much about price than quality. If I am building an
engine I'm definitely not putting anything in there I've never heard of.
Personally, I'd just fork out the $299 that Rocky mountain wants for a set.
I haven't checked with Berg, but they are also guaranteed quality. Might
check with aircooled_dot_net too. I know I for one wouldn't want to go through
an engine rebuild twice in one year. Hope this helps!

PS-My 1957 Sunroof bus ends in an hour on vintage bus auction! Go bid on
it!!!
