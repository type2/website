&lt;&lt; I finally got the 67 crew cab on the road. I noticed the red numbers on the
 speedometer that I assume are shift points. I can't get close to these marks
 without revving the motor up to about 4000 RPM. Is this right?
 Thanks in advance,
  &gt;&gt;

you may not have the stock gearing.  VW tended to say 'top/ cruising speed' 
would be around 3500 -3600 rpms.  also, do you have the same size tires all 
the way around?
