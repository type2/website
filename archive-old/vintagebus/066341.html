Subject: My OCTO trip

  Well as it goes I left late Saturday to OCTO, the drive was uneventful,
easily cruising at 72/75 MPH down the highway. I did reaffirm that I cannot
drive any faster pulling the trailer. Got from Havasu to Riverside where I
hit the brakes, not because of an emergency, just because of traffic!.
California sucks. It took me longer to go the last 100 miles of my trip then
the first 200. Got to a friends house talked to a few friends and headed
down to the beach to meet up with Tommy (61 westy). The weather was
beautiful at the beach, so I decided to camp down there with Tommy. Will do
that again  when the next OCTO comes around.
   Woke up Sunday morning and headed over to OCTO, I was one of the first
people there. One of the greatest things at an OCTO show, they move people
in fast, not like Barf-O-Ramas or the Classic where you can sit in line for
an hour or more to get in.
   Got parked and started to walk around before putting my stuff out. Didn't
find anything interesting to buy, but there were 4 sets of single cab gates
there for sale by different people!
   The lot started to fill up and by 8:30/9:00 it was full, the locals like
to sleep in I guess. A LOT of buses for sale with the prices seeming to
start to go down, except for 60/61 Westys, one for 12K and another for
25,000! Looks like Tommy got a smoking deal on his near perfect complete 61
westy for 10K!!!
   There was a BD panel for sale, near perfect for 14K, but a lot of decent
drivers for under 3k. Even a really clean pop top Westy which didn't sell or
have any lookers for 3500! Everybody must have what they are looking for
now.
   The drive back was SLOW. I followed Tommy and drove at 55/60 MPH, we then
stopped for gas and a huge puddle appeared under his bus and the engine
compartment was covered in oil!!! Checked it out and turned out the oil on
the ground was gear oil and the engine oil was caused (more then likely)
from over filling and lack of proper breather. I told Tommy to go ahead and
drop the speed 5 more MPH so the trip went even slower. Got to the Desert
Center turn off (only 140 miles to go) and Tommy pulled over and complained
of a heavy vibration and thought his trans was going. I listened and said
mine as well go for it and if you break I'll tow you till we're within a
hundred miles and then use my AAA 100 mile plus card.
   He proceeded on and drove at 50 mph. I haven't driven that slow since the
Corona de Tucson show 2 years ago.
   A few hours later we made it to Havasu, Tommys trans held together so now
he just has to find out what happened, at least HE isn't afraid to drive his
buses (he also has the beautiful 63 DD standard)

Ronnie  

ps. gas mileage out  17 mpg at 70/75 mph
gas mileage home  25 when doing 60 mph, 20 when doing 50 mph!
