Subject: Battery clamp corrosion prevention - WAS: Ignition Switch/Headlight Problem

[...]

If the felt anti-corrosion pads fit OK, they're a good solution.  In some
applications they won't allow the battery clamps to go all the way down on
the posts.  The tops of the clamps should be flush with the tops of the
posts when installed correctly.

For 30+ years I've sprayed my cleaned and tightened battery clamps with
WD-40, and I've never had a clamp corrode using this approach.

Doesn't hurt to clean the battery case as well, and spray it with WD-40.  A
clean battery is a happy battery.

&gt;&gt; I agree except I prefer to use the felt red and green pads from your
flaps to prevent battery corrosion. They just work and are very cheap and
not nasty like vaseline  &lt;&lt;
