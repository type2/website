Hey y'all
Things have been quiet lately as far as techwork on the busses so besides a 
trip report nothing really to post.  Since I'm on digest mode the cool 
questions have already been answered before I read them so....

Tuesday night made arrangements to pick up some friends in the Burrito 
Express for a speaking engagement.  I was almost at their house, went to 
downshift and NOTHING HAPPENED.

There was a distinct lack of 3rd to 2nd.  Lots of 3/4 action, no 1/2.  I did 
a driveby of their house (they were waiting out front) and kept going.  Was 
worth it for the look on their faces.  Called them on the cool-phone and 
'splained the situation.  They came and picked me up and we made the event 
on time, tho the arrival was not as eventful as it might have been.

Yesterday afternoon, I got home, took a powernap, and crawled under the 
Express.  Sure enough, 1 of the rubber doughnuts in the aft shift linkage 
had given it's all.  Damn poor quality control, rubber dealies only lasting 
30 years!

I had a urethane unit for the Tinkertoy that I never carried cleverly hidden 
in my 'weird around the house box' with the waterproof fuse and way cool 
items I can no longer identify, much less recall what project I got them 
for.  Of course the splitty bushing is different, being 1 piece.  I sliced 
my thumb cutting the bushing to the appropriate thickness, bushed the inside 
with nylon hose, and installed my neangineered bushings.

What a difference!.  Before, finding gears was kinda like how I play pool - 
poke n'hope.  Now there's a definite H pattern and I can actually feel the 
engagement.  The shift mechanism transmits tranny sound along the rod, so 
the noise level increased slightly.

Life is good!

Mad Uncle Dave
&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
