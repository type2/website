Subject: Abandoned VW

There is an abandoned VW a few miles from my house.  I didn't think much
of it at first, just figured someone broke down and had not come to retrieve
it yet.  It's in a shopping mall parking lot and I've seen there for at
least 6 months.  It has not moved.  The license plates are from out of state
and expired in 1988.

I was thinking of having AAA tow to my house.  Has anyone ever &quot;acquired&quot;
a vehicle this way?  Any tips?  Oh, and the doors are locked...
