&lt;&lt; Ok. I am tired of getting home after 12 hours of slaving for the government
 and having 50 emails of everyone wanting the same parts. I like to help, but
 I can't handle all this. I dont do this to make money, this is a hobby. I
 couldn't keep track of all these emails if I wanted to. Call me a pos I
 really dont care, I dont feel like putting up with it. Parts I promised to
 Greg and Everett are going to them as I have been chatting with them from
 the get go. thatvwguy, the roof is yours if you still want it. Not that I
 haven't been chatting with anyone else, but I honestly (no offense)dont
 remember. I know I mustve promised that Berlin Tag to 3 different people.
 Its going up for auction. Plain and simple. If you are one of teh three
 people I told could have it, sorry. Like I said I can't keep up with it,
 especially that darn Berlin tag. I dont know what the deal is with that. If
 you want it, bid on it. It'll be on ebarf tonight. I know I have been
 talking to you Steve, and if you email me again, I will try to square you
 away as well. There is one other person who wanted interior trim for $50 and
 berlin tag. You can still have the trim if you want it, but no tag. If you
 dont want it, i understand. If I promised anyone else any parts, and you
 really need them, email me again and I'll try to help. Anyone else, sorry
 but I can't help unless your bus is broke down for this part or something.
 Whatever is left I will have my wife ebay for me. Everyone mentioned please
 email to my aol addy. Sorry if I pissed anyone off. Dont flame me, I'll
 delete. I dont want to hear it. I'm not a business and dont need anyones
 money. You dont like me, put yourself in my shoes. This has just been way
 too much. I understand when you need parts, but damn, there must be 1000
 lurkers on this list all looking for early parts. ..then again, I guess
 there probably is. Anyways, good luck with all of your searches, and I
 apologize once again if I can't follow through with any deals.
