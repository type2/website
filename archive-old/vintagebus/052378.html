Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt to 12 volt-Solid state voltage regulators

&gt;You wouldn't even have to electrically insulate it...ground the negative
&gt;terminal of the 6v battery to the frame/body, then run a single 6v+ wire
&gt;to the heater. Disconnect the wire that would normally supply voltage
&gt;to the heater and connect the 6V+ wire to it. The ground is the
&gt;return path to the battery.  You are correct, though...you would have
&gt;recharge the 6V battery often...



cool! i wasn't sure if the 'lectricity would get confused by the 'two'
ground paths (6 and 12v) and go running to the wrong battery :)
