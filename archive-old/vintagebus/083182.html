Subject: Wipers Again

Just redid my 6 volt last night. Took it apart and scraped out all old, hard
grease. Cleaned, sanded,relubed and back together. Ran it on 6volt for about
10 mins. then switched to 12 volt and let it run for over an hour with no
problems, runs faster than 6 volt but did not burn up. Will run it on 12 volt
in the bus and use as backup if Rainx fails.
