&lt;&lt; current panel needs lots of work, and would be real expensive, 
 but owning a one off bus like that would be well worth it. Or cheaping out 
 and loosing the vin # and M # from the original will make up for the money 
to 
 be made when it would be sold to Japan when done. Don't say it cant be 
fixed, 
 I bet Kelly could. &gt;&gt;

 if it matters vins and m codes are transferable. just get a similar bus. or 
just forget about it, and put it on another year. I wouldn't care if I were 
buying. as long as it was well done, and the year of the bus fell within the 
time span that the company was building them.

It's coach built anyway, it is no longer factory original. if it felt better 
you could wear coveralls with the conversion companys logo on them while you 
sawed it apart.

You dot need to have an original to get high dollars from Japan. Note factory 
rug top standard with six sky lights on the Japanese sight posted to the list 
a few days ago.
 
But Kelly probably could fix it.
