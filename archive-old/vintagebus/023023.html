I've added a new feature to my site.  Not the happiest, but I felt it was
necessary.  There is now a place on my site to report stolen VW's (I'll let
non split bus VW's slide on this one).  It lets you record plate #, vin,
phone #, location.

I hope none of you have to use this, but it's there if you need it.

As always, suggestions welcome.
