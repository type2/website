THat passenger vs commercial distinction makes a lot of sense.   I thought 
that 61-63 buses all came with the laminated/sigla glass. But then I heard of 
and saw earlier buses with sigla, but come to think of it they were pass 
buses or campers.   56 deluxe has large logo SEKURIT.  60 DD panel had 
sekurit, 60 truck sekurit, 59 panel had sekurit, 59 truck sekurit, 58 DD had 
sekurit- most of the late 50s buses I have had were commercials.   61 deluxe 
has sigla, 61 standard sigla

&lt;&lt; Passenger busses from 57-61 were REQUIRED BY LAW to have safety glass 
 (laminates) windshields installed in all EXPORT vehicles.
 Between 62-65 the laws became less strict.
 Laminated (sigla) glass you cannot drill through without cracking.

 &lt;&lt; I don't think it's a &quot;later&quot; thing, I think it's just a glass option 
thing.
  My '55 had thru-the-glass window, but my '56 had &quot;on top&quot; latches.  What
 does this mean?  It means that you could use thru the glass stuff, save
 your sanity, and would not have to worry about being incorrect.  
 
 I remember someone saying those funky windows came about because of not
 being able to drill that type of glass. &gt;&gt;
