Subject: Fall OCTO

Hmmm.  No mention of OCTO last Sunday, so I'll do the Readers Digest version.

Great weather as usual
Average to small attendance (bug stock was going on so some people left early)
Small to non existent swap (didn't even pull out my wallet)
Two raffles of which I think Karl won 7 or 8 times!  Got booed at the end.
No Ronnie (I needed to trade a heater cable :-( )
A 5K bus for sale for 20K (yikes!!) Prices are F'ing out of this world. 
A sure sign that the apocalypse is coming.

Fun as usual...if you weren't there you should have been.

Steve
