  Westley's White, available at Wally World, K-Farts and about any auto
parts store, the best thing out there, has been around longer then me, works
great, especially on visors, originally from England, but now mainstream

Subject: [VB] Cleaning headlining


Hello,

Any ideas on how to clean a pin hole headlining?  A friend has just bought a
66 bus and the headlining is still tight, but has yellowish stains in
places.  We tried cleaning it with CIF but that didn't touch it
unfortunately. 

Cheers
Paul
