Subject: Bus Towbar? - no thanks

Volks,

I looked at this towbar too - until I heard what happens when you don't use
the muffler clamps...or they work loose...

The bar rides back &amp; forth, beating up your front beam and all the gear
attached.  Eventually the towbar bends in on itself and you lose control,
after a wild ride.

No thanks.  I'll find someone to weld one up for me that fits, and out of
real steel too.  The design is okay, but Dr. Joe should make them specific
to different year bus axles.  Look at the two types of Bug towbars as
examples.

I'm not going to trust my rig to a couple of muffler clamps.  A full width
rig out of heavier gauge tubing is the answer.
