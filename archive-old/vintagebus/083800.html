Subject: double cab pin or button??  also crying bus

Hello,
A few years ago I bought a nice lapel pin of a white
split window double cab, and had it on my cap for a
few years.  I also picked up a similar nicely done pin
of the &quot;crying bus&quot; commemorating Jerry Garcia.  Well,
I lost the cap I had them on and of course both pins
this summer, and would like to replace it, but haven't
seen one for sale for quite a while.  Any ideas where
to get one?
I bought my double cab pin at a regular car show, not
even a VW show, from a fellow who had them for every
kind of car or vehicle you could imagine. Haven't seen
him since either. The crying bus I did get at a VW
show, but haven't seen any more of them either.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI
