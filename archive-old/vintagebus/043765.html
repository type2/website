&gt;&gt;The line went through a small bracket that was attached via the screw that
&gt;&gt;held the shroud to the #3/#4 top cylinder tin.  I think I've seen this in a
&gt;&gt;factory book, but not sure.  Was this stock?
&gt;
&gt;Funny you should mention this.  In all the years I've worked on VWs, I've
&gt;only seen this clamp once and that was about 3 weeks ago.  It was on the
&gt;line but not connected.  It's a little clamp that holds the gas line to the
&gt;left side of the fanshroud and uses the shroud bolt to secure itself.

After a few responses along these lines I had the brilliant idea to
check the parts book.  The barndoor book doesn't seem to show it, but
the '58-'67 book does:

The listing says: &quot;311 127 525  Clamp-Fuel line  from engine 3 400 000&quot;
so anything post-36hp should have it.

Even though I got my fuel line to &quot;float&quot; in space, it does come pretty
close to the left side of the fan shroud.  Having a clamp there makes
sense.
