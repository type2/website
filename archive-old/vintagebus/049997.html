Stephen G. is not inclined to toot his own horn but I want to do it for
him: this man spent literally weeks crafting the custom archive search
engine we use now.

What he came up with allows any of us to search all known aircooled
archives in a way that has never been done before, it's EXTREMELY flexible
and amazingly fast, and he runs it out of his own server FOR FREE, no cost
to us whatsoever.

If you have a splitty DC with a very good body that you'd consider letting
go, please get with him. He has done us priceless favors and asked for
nothing.
