Ohh PLEASE!

Look in your newspaper. Currently its about 1.84DM per Dollar, so its
about $6.
And don't write on the bill.

Some people seem to expect all kind of secret information to come out of
this correspondence.
Especially for the US cars this is not so. The body ID plate will tell
you more than VW can in most instances.
Its more interesting for cars that went to exotic countries, but those
usually never made it to the US (the ID plate tells you if it went to
the US dirctly).

I think it only makes sense to write to Wolfsburg if there is something
suspicious about your car, like it being 10 inches longer than it should
be.

on the 50s buses, before cica ch 398 000 when  the m code tag was intoduced, 
the info from the car is very limited.   you get  a vin # , not  much info.  

so I wrote to the factory, including a 10dm note which for some reason I had 
around, the Vin number, and eventually recieved a nice fancy piece of paper 
telling me the ate of production, date of delivery, place sent to, original 
colours (well I knew that already) and M codes.  I though it worth the $7 or 
so.   They also sent me a little xeroxed booklet of interior colours and 
paint colours available , both the data for splitties and bays, and a big 
list of m codes.  this booklet was xeroxed ofout of parts lists it seemed, 
and was in German, but has some codes I don't have listed anywhere else.
