You gotta hit Wolfsberg, Onsbruick (sp?) (Karmann Ghia museum), and the VW
museum in Berlin.  While in Berlin you may want to checkout the Checkpoint
Charlie museum.  They have a VW bug in there with the gas tank relocated to
the rear of the car so that a person can hide in the front.

&lt;&lt; s an example, I hear the GoFast
 guys prattle on all day long about how &quot;stroked&quot; they are, and their webber
 42 DNF (did not finish) carbs, yet I never hear brakes mentioned. &gt;&gt;

That also comes up with some locals around here.  Brag about their dual 48s
and big exhaust with no mention of braking improvements. In fact most of
them
are still running just plain old stock systems.

They tinker and tinker with their motors day after day while i run circles
around them.
They might be able to get there fast but I can go farther in one piece.

I don't have anything against the fast VW guys at all.  In fact some day I
hope to have one.  For now I will just kick back and enjoy the benefits of
stock simplicity.

WooHoo!  Im finally 21 today!!

p.s. For my birthday my family all pitched in together and got me 2 round
trip tickets aboard Air Luthansa to Frankfurt.  Gonna toodle around there
for
a week and a half.  Anyone know anybody I could visit out there? Listees?
Cool VW people?
