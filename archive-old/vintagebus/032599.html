be VERY scared of the plastic plugs.  i've seen them heat up, warp, the
centers cave in and the axle/nut rub a groove in them, which isn't good
when you're driving and all your gear oil is pouring out.
the oval hole is a new one to me.  maybe a bearing came apart one time in
the past? or someone forced in or out a metal freeze plug at one time?

&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; We gave up on the metal plug and tried a plastic one, which at least
finally
&gt; would go into the hole (not without some effort).  The edges were painted
with
&gt; aviation gasket maker, and the spring plate was bolted up. 
Unfortunately, it
&gt; still leaks, although not quite so badly as before. 


&gt; Any ideas what warps a freeze plug hole like that?  I mean, it's visibly
not
&gt; round.  We were thinking perhaps it was heated up or something.
