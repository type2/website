Subject: m-code questions

29  4  production date of April 29th

425 (seat belts)

025 (US Bumpers 6 popouts)

043 (Prep for Swiss licensing)

UF (US, but where)

2112 (Panel van Cargo doors right, LHD Lacquer finish)

131383 (pearl white/ pearl white w/mesh grey int.)

614XXXX ('66 and Vin number)


These were found on my '66 Riviera Camper, I knew what most of
them were, my only questions are.........

What exactly did Swiss preparation include??
Why would the m codes show 6 popouts on a panel??
Where is UF?? and is there a list of these codes somewhere??

Why couldn't I find a decoder on your site Thom?? Did I overlook
it??


Thanks,
Greg
