&gt; SOTO meet at the Duck Pond, Anaheim, CA?  That's right across the street
&gt; from the best brew pub in Orange county. I'll meet everyone there and
&gt; have a show in the parking lot!  Free!

NOPE! the SOTO meet will NOT be held at the Duck Pond the day before the
Classic in Irvine.  But... If you are looking for the OCTO meet, it WILL be
at the Duck Pond the day before the Classic.
