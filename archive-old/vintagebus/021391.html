&lt;&lt; My bus does not seem to have a 3rd and a 4th gear! I just came back from a
canoe trip a 30 MPH and it was painfully slow. Let me describe the symptoms:

 -Recent clucth cable change, pedal is giving the proper free play and
stiffness.
 -For a while (not very long), 3rd and 4th were hard to shift and now it's
just as if they never existed, no way to get it in, even at idle or with
engine not running.  -1st and 2nd go in fine.
 -I was able to get into 3rd one more time (I always try, you know 30mph
gives you a lot of time to hope it's going to work...), but now it's back to
nothing.

 Someone told me a &quot;fork&quot; for the 3rd and 4th gear in the transaxle had gone
south and transaxle had to be changed. Could it be something else since 1st
and 2nd are ok?       Mathieu     '67 Westy-Deluxe &gt;&gt;

Hi Mathieu,
We are forwarding your problem to the list just in case someone else may have
a better solution.  We advise checking out all of the shift linkage for loose
or worn out parts first.  Also have you resently loosened your shifter bolts
or have they come loose?  If so your shifter base may be too far to the right
causing you not to fully engage 3rd and 4th gear.  If this is not the case
then it is probably a tranny rebuild time.  Eric&amp;Barb
