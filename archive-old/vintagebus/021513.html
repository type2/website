Subject: Easter = Friday or, Whew, that was close!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I got back from my daughter's Easter Sunday early dinner this afternoon, and 
found my north section of fence around my little front yard was smashed to 
bits.  The east corner of this little yard is about three feet from my '61 
Flipseat Westy!

The neighbor came over to tell me that his sister was driving out of their 
parent's drive across the road, and another driver came barreling around the 
corner (I live in the heart of downtown Albuquerque) hit her car, and pushed 
her into a street sign, and my fence.  I've got to thank this woman for 
having the presence of mind to steer for the fence and not the bus!  
Seriously, about three feet separate the two.

The only worse thing I heard today was Lou (from Havasu) had a minor engine 
fire, but got it under control.  Don't think Easter's my favorite 
holiday....but then most who know me know I'm not a holiday kind of guy.  I 
work seven days a week:  not many hours each day, but seven days.

PS I guess the moral is: Carry a fire extinguisher, and all the insurance you 
can afford.
