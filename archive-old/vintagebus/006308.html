Yeah the official snow fall for Beatrice, NE was 10 to 12&quot;.  I drug out the
scooter and the neighbor's dog came over and bit me on the back of my
snowboarder boot.  Had I seen the dog to start with, I'd have chased it down
with my titanium crowbar and beat it to death.  I'm installing a baseball
bat and crowbar in the shed tonight just in case it happens again.  Anyway,
I rode the scooter to work today and I was only the 3rd person there.  The
yard crew showed up and then our boss - nobody else.  We cleaned up the
warehouse and piddled around.  The electricity went out and some dingbat
crybabied on the phone to my boss about needing lumber so I was out in it
loading around 400 pieces of wood.  Jerk...

It does get a guy down when the weather is like this but it makes you
appreciate the nice weather once it comes back.  I would still take the 104
degrees at BNNTA last September of this anyday but next year at this time,
I'll have me a shop and I'll work through all kinds of weather.  That will
make everything more tolerable I believe.

One thing I've noticed about big snow stories - when I tell them to people
south of me, they usually reply, &quot;Well the most we've ever had was 1/4&quot; and
it melted off within hours after it came down.  If I tell people north of me
how much snow I got, I hear, &quot;BAH!  That ain't nuthin' - we get that
everyday.&quot;

I guess it's all relative.
