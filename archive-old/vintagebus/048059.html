 Ok, so I'm moving right along.  Got most of the motor together.  Put
 flywheel on pins.  Yep.  Tighten gland nut.  Yep.  Put funny little tool
 with 10mm wrench and all-thread and nuts in one of the case holes, a la
 Muir.  So here's the problem.  As I understand it, the 3 shims should be two
 .24mm ones, plus another one of the .30-.36 variety.  But the way I see it,
 I can only get the two .24mm ones to fit along with the appropriate feeler
 gauge when I push on the flywheel.  (ya, I hammered on it, tried several
 times, and all that)  So, do I just install the two shims and leave it at
 that, or does this indicate a problem???
 thanks in advance,
 Diana

well, its like this.  dont bang.  This is a fiddly procedure, so find a 
comfortable place to sit.   You want the flywheel to have a little movement 
there.  otherwise it will bind up , your motor will seize, and generally be a 
PITA.   But you dont want too much slopp in there, or the crank will slopp 
back and forth against the bearings and case and generally bash itself into 
the scrap pile.  You want it just right.  And VW says use 3 shims,   so use 
three shims,  of the right thickness.   Sounds like you need to get some 
thinner shims.   The end play should be .003&quot; or .004&quot; to .006&quot;

so you put two shims in, put the FW one, torque it down, remnove the FW lock, 
check the end play.  Install a 3rd shim to makes the space about .005&quot;   If 
it is too tight, to put a 3rd shim in, you have to get thinner shims.  This 
is why they come in several sizes.  just have to do some math.  Basically you 
need to find the amount of end play you have, and figure what 3 shims work to 
make the end play .004-.006&quot;.  dont be attached to the shims it used to have, 
if this bottom end was rebuildt, its a whole new number, and you change the 
shimmage to fit the motor.   You also have to be really anal about not 
getting any grit in the shims when you install them.  clean clean clean.  
After you get a combonation of 3 installed and they check out the right 
endplay, then you take the FW back off, and install the main seal and new o 
ring, put them back on, Voila!!
