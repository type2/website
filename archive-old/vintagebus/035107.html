&lt;&lt; Yes.  You want GL-4  Sta-Lube still makes it.  Buy a gallon,  which will

Hi Volks,
If the tranny is a mystery about when the tranny oil was last changed or just 
rebuilt you will need to change the oil again after the next/first 1,000 
miles.   This will help get rid of more of the crud in there or the metal 
particles from wear in.   Eric&amp;Barb
