&gt; Just recieved this info today, I am still looking for someone who would like
&gt; to share a room. I am making my room reservations this week. The cheapest
&gt; airfare I have found from LA or Phoenix is $974.00 r/t, if anybody finds a
&gt; cheaper fare from either of these airports please let me know, even Las
&gt; Vegas would work

have you considered cheap (SWair) tickets to BWI (Baltimore Washington
International) where you can get cheap Icelandair tickets to Frankfurt
