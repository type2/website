ate and Fag are German and readily available, yet pricey compared to others,
there is also Varga (Mexico and Brazil, now owned by Auto Specialty company,
a huge repacker and manufacturer of after market and OEM parts), TVA (India)
junk but some people seem to like them, LPR (Italy) no comment on these as
I've heard good and bad, won't sell these till they have been around a while
longer, TRW, who knows what you'll get, I've seen TRW parts from India,
Pakistan and the U S, you need to open ever box to make sure you're getting
parts from the same manufacturer.

I personally have used both the German and Brazilian in my buses and haven't
noticed any difference in longevity with either.

Get ATE cylinders when you can, otherwise Varga is a &quot;will work&quot;  I've
seen another brand, whose name escapes me, that was made in some asian
country.   Which doesn't necessarily mean the Varga and ATE ones aren't
made in the orient, either.

I don't know where the shoes are relined, but I've seen varying degrees
of thickness and quality.
