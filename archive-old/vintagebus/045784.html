&lt;&lt; Just wondering if you know of anyone who could key an ignition to match 
the doors... guess it was replaced somewhere along the line.... and if I 
could get the engine lid on the same key that would be even better   This is 
for a 70 bus.&gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
First all tumblers would have to be of the same key pattern to begin with.  
Then your local old locksmith might be able to do it, or perhaps Gabriel's of 
California might be able to help.
  
&lt;&lt;Also have a 67 which is missing some lock cylinders.  Any VW lock guru you 
could recommend? &gt;&gt;
1967 has not only one year tumblers, but also some of the handles themselfs 
are one year only.  So you would have to look and perhaps advertise for which 
of these parts you need!
