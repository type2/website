&gt;there are five buses where i live.

[others respond with their competitive and whimsical lists]

There are two busses where I live.  Actually there are about a dozen, but most of them are too small for me to get into -- unless I'm *really* wasted, man.  And then 
everything else on the bookshelf is HUGE, and sometimes it's really SCARY, especially the spines of all those gigantic Conrad novels.  Like &quot;Lord Jim&quot; - hey, didn't they 
just replay the opening part of that off the African coast a couple of weeks ago?

One time I fell asleep in the back of the Franklin Mint 23-window deluxe and when I woke up?  Boy did my head hurt.  It takes like HOURS to extricate yourself from a 
1/25th scale vehicle, dude -- take it from me.

Hey, what's this stuff smeared on the pages of my Tom Robbins novel?
