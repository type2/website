Karl and All;

I made a quick research trip to a couple of FLAPS here (one being
Al's/Grand Auto) and discovered that all the Sta-Lube containers,
regardless of size, say &quot;GL-4&quot; on the front, but in the small print on
the back it says &quot;conforms to ...GL-3 &amp; GL-4...&quot;

Now I'm trying to track down the details of the GL-3 specification to see
if it's compatible with a Type 2 transaxle's unique requirements.

Stay tuned.....

&gt;Going to all the local parts stores, I found almost all of them 
&gt;carried the 
&gt;same stuff. It didn't matter about the packaging, whether it said 
&gt;Valvoline, 
&gt;Pennzoil, Castrol, or their brand....it still said GL-5. Until I found 
&gt;that 
&gt;Grand Auto was the only one that carried Sta Lube brand. They have 
&gt;GL-4 by 
&gt;itself....no bs that it is compatible with GL-5 or it is the same as 
&gt;GL-3, 
&gt;4, 5. It is GL-4, either in 85-90 or 140, in quarts or gallons. A 
&gt;gallon was 
&gt;$7.49.
