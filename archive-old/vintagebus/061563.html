Subject: Re: [VB] Cargo door handle

yes, especially because 67 cargo door handles break.  if you see a bus with a 
broken cargo door handle 95% chance its a 67.  as the key is longer the 
handle is weaker, and yanking the handle eventually breaks it off, (but does 
not open the door)

 &gt; Thanks for the reply.  Are 66 and 67 keys different?  My drivers door and 
 &gt; engine lid lock are different to the other locks - slightly longer keys 
and 
 &gt; appear to be VW but aren't the cutout VW sign.
 
 Hi Paul,
 The 1967 &quot;L&quot; profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter &quot;T&quot; 
 tumbler fit.  If you have &quot;L&quot; profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for 
 the &quot;T&quot; ones you need.  Since the &quot;L&quot; profile parts are one year only you 
 will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front door 
 soon to get those parts!
