Double, Crew?  How about PDK for Pritschenwagen mit Doppel Kabine, or pickup with double cab? We've got Kombi's, right?  The comment I always get is &quot;did you make a pickup out of a van?&quot;. I give the polite responsible answer, but want to say &quot;Yeah, pretty good job, dontchathink?&quot;

_at_#$*_at_#$) foreign carbs! One of my 34mm Dellorto's has a drill or guage broken off in it's idle jet. First time I've used these. I can reach through the window to turn the key and start the engine, go to the back and pull off the #1 AND #2 plug wires off the dizzy and no change in the idle speed. Guess I'm ready for the slow drags in Jerome. Fresno is 55 miles from Farmersville, home of CB Performance and not one vwflaps or motorcycle shop has the jet. I'll take a couple hours off work and drive my Thing down there. It's got one good German carb.
