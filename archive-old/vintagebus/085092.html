&gt; Since it is Friday, may I also ask for oyur prayers to any 
&gt; deity for my brother, who I'm here taking care of.  He is 
&gt; very ill, and the one who taught me how to work on VWs 
&gt; and bought me my first, a 67 fastback, from a junkyard
&gt; for a dollar and had it running in three hours! Thanks 
&gt; and peace.

Sounds like something you'll remember for the rest of 
your life.  My the VW gods look down upon you this holiday 
season.  Here's to hoping your brother gets better!

Paul
