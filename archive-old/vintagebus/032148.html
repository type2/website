&lt;&lt; What is the best way to take care of surface rust that is underneath ?
 I dont have a sandblaster and dont want to crawl underneath with a sanding
 block and go at it.  Should I take it to a Powder Coating place and let them
 do it ?  If so will have to disconnect all the cables from underneath
 before? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
  The problem is that the plastic powder coating is sprayed onto what is to be
painted while a electrostatic charge is applied which attracks the powder
coating to evenly cling to the part.  Then the part is put into a oven and
heated to temps of about 400F.  Also we do not know of any powder coating
place that has a oven that would be large enough to fit an entire bus.  Plus
you would have to compleately strip your bus of any parts and wiring that
could not take the high melting temperature of the oven.  
  This all reminds us of one fellow up here in the NW USA that wanted to carry
salt water fishing nets in the back of his bus.  So he had the bus stripped
down to metal and the rear of the bus up to the front doors zinc plated to
prevent the salt from eating his bus alive. 
   You might want to check out the local sand blasting places in your area to
do the rust removal and then use NAPA zinc rich primer or other brand primer
that is simular to the original VW factory zinc rich primer.  If you buy the
NAPA brand by the case you get 10% off.      Eric &amp; Barb
