Volks:

Since this stuff is designed to be used in roofing applications, I'm
guessing that it is not highly flammable.  (Is the shower bed stuff the
same stuff?)  Can anybody confirm/confute this surmise?

Also, I suspect that it might also be a better product for under-carpet
sound deadening applications, as it sould not absorb and hold moisture,
as would seem to be the likely consequence of the roofing-felt/styrofoam
sandwich idea.  Comments on this guess are also welcome.

In either case (panels or floor), roofing tar does seem to have the
greatest number of advantages, being suitable for insulation, deadening,
sealing -- and it's cheap.

Lastly, I want to put in a plug for the environmentally and VW conscious
option of saving/using the felt from other VWs you part out.  It's
cheap, genuine VW, and is otherwise just wasted.

My apologies to those who though/hoped that this thread was already
dead.
