&lt;&lt; Hi. I'm looking for all the places to find numbers on my '64 panel. At
 least I can assume this is a 64 since that's what it says on the title.
 M-codes plate is missing from behind the seat and the plate on the
 overhead unit only has this number: typ 21(i know it means panel) and:
 1276786. I could not find any numbers in the engine compartment and the
 number on the title is: 8132105129. Does anybody know what this is and
 where possibly I can find the real numbers? Can this be a bus that
    &gt;&gt;

wow- that's a real long vin number on the title. 

the number on the tag on the overhead unit is the VIN, and it does indicate 
early April 64 production,   It should match the number in the engine 
compartment
