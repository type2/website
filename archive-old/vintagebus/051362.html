Subject: What a long strange trip(long)

It's eight days,3700 plus miles,227 gals of gas and more hours of driving
than I can count in seriously nasty weather but I survived the trip from
Vancouver Is to Phoenix and back in more or less one piece.

Headed out last weds to be a good guy and help the ex move in socal, 'course
I need to justify the trip so I had to make a few stops along the way. First
up was to drop off the bumper I promised Staffan north of Sacramento, Hard
to predict exactly when you'll arrive after that many miles, but I figured I
could hit 5am pretty easy. Sure enough, had the meeting place scoped by 2am
and figured to grab some shuteye. I thought those damn trucks had in cab
heaters, but seemed like everyone was running their engine all night. Well
you grab what you can, turns out it was the cold that woke me up a little
before 5a and sure enough, a couple minutes before the hour a car comes
bombing thru the lot. As I'm the only thing there smaller than a big rig, it
heads towards me. Sure enough Its Staffan. We quickly complete the business
end and get down to the business of talking buses. Only problem is its pitch
black, colder than the bottom of a well and he's to head to work. Glad you
like the bumper.

Next down to Harry's in Fresno to pickup the towbar he so graciously brought
from Havasu, even spotting me the money on trust. Looks like good guys do
win, 'cause he sure seem to clean up on the raffle. Had a chance to meet his
wife who kept trying to get me to drink more coffee. I had to laugh, in
talking to her about Harry's buses, she got the same pained expression that
so many of our long suffering spouses get. We probably should come with a
warning label, something simple like 'I brake for junkyards' or I peer in
peoples backyards from the freeway. Soon enough Harry arrives and I get the
tour and a chance to seen the his electric thing. Then its time to pick up
my pretty new towbar and down the highway to Costa Mesa.

I had arranged with an ebayer that if won his auction I'd pick it up on my
swing down. Sure enough headed over to pick up my new/used 6v southwind
heater. Find the guy out front working on his bus, promptly get recruited to
help him bleed his brakes. Not a problem, then he asks if I have the install
manual, tell him no, I was going to have to order it. Says just a minute and
comes back out with a copy and a replacement set of points for the heater
which he'd listed as needing to be replaced. My kind of ebayer.

By now its thurs afternoon time to rest up, help the x move and push on to
Phoenix.
Head out to Phoenix sat afternoon, got my map and a 6'er of microbrew for
'ellis. Geez, now I know why the Az contingent complains about speed.
Freeways marked at 75 and the big rigs figure 90's better. I've got the
astro haulin butt and being passed left and right by soccer moms in Suv's.
Still I survive and arrive in Phoenix, time to pick up the SO-69 camp kit,
everyone thinks I'm crazy but I really wanted this kit, enough to add the
the extra drive time and even bribe Jim with beer. Meet Jim at the door,
crack a microbrew thats starting to get warm and head out for the garage
tour. What is it about us that makes us totally forget about the house and
want to spend all our time in the garage? Head out for burgers and to bring
some food back for the mrs. Eat some chow, drool over the camper and puck
combo for the thousand time and talk 'ellis out of the knob I need for the
66 sundial. As it's still early I say goodbye to 'ellis and head back to LA
to get a head start on the honey do list.

Not sure if you can still call it a honey do list when your no longer
married, tell her to get a handy boyfriend but I break down and do the 'guy'
things that need to be done when you move. At least I'm rewarded with a
couple of good dinners. Why is it guys can be bought with a steak dinner and
gas money?

I'm refreshed,feed and loaded to go, time to point it north, sunshine was
nice but I remember why I left LaLa land. Make it as far as the grapefine,
reminiscing about all the trips I've made over this piece of asphalt and all
the offroad riding I've done here. Fate takes a hand and traffic slams to a
stop at Gorman. Great, pitch dark 6 lane parking lot the winds been a bitch
and its starting to snow what the hecks up. Radio says their closing the
grapevine, little late for that, trucker says huge accident at Fraiser park.
We sit, we wait, two hours later flashing lights appear. We move, a couple
hundred feet, we stop and wait again. Looks like sure enough, we're going to
get a chp escort. I'm laughing and yelling, back home they had two feet of
snow, here the grounds not even covered and their closing a major
freeway&lt;sigh&gt; we move out in our little group hitting a flying 35mph. No
sign of an accident anywhere. Heading down the Bakersfield side we see a
half dozen cars pulled to the side of the road at various angles, chper
keeps right on going, people in front of me slam their brakes and fishtail
to a stop, I've already geared down and left space,kick in some brake and
let the antilock do its thing. Guy behind me been riding my tail and cant
stop, feel him tap the rear end, grin 'cause I know he just hit the square
reciever with the foot long hitch and now has a tattoo'd front end. I'm not
getting out, its warm in here. They cut us loose at Grapevine and we hit the
flat running hard north. Twenty hours later I pull up to customs, any booze
or cigarettes they ask, nope only vw junk. Any receipts they ask again, nope
bought from friends. Welcome home they say.

If you read this far I'll leave you with a quote from Harry's wife, 'I'll
bet you didnt drive your bus all this way did you'&lt;grin&gt;

Chuck
Van Is.
