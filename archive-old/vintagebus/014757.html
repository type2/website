&gt; Chuck,
&gt;     While going thru Vegas, if you have time, give
&gt; me a shout if you need
&gt; anything.  I'm just of I-15 and Charlston.  I think
&gt; I'm the only Vegas guy
&gt; left on the list now that Eric sold his bus and Beto
&gt; moved to Texas.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Jon,
Thanks for the reply, sorry to hear you are the last
active list member left in Vegas. 
I appreciate your offer for emergency assistance while
traveling thru Vegas, and certainly look me up should
you ever find yourself (or any other listee) in the
Reno area.
