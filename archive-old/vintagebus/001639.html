In case anyone was curious about getting info on your bus using the online
form, I did it.... 2 months ago. Today I received a letter from Wolfsburg
stating that they would be happy to research details on my vehicle......BUT,
please send them 10 DM per vehicle and they'll get right on it. They also
included a blank &quot;would be&quot; info list...a tease perhaps? *sigh* All that
waiting for nothing.
