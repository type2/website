Wow- i'm impresed, I had thought about doing something like this with the 
first split I had, but never had the nerve.  Also I dont have teh artistic 
ability.

I have seen a split painted like Van Gogh's Starry Night-  excellent.  seen a 
few well muralled vans, most are bad artwork/graffiti.     Being a fan of 
Peter Maxx, that sounds great.  Also think the one colour about/murals below 
is nice- think I saw something like that and it was good.    

You can always repaint it.  if you want.   My 65 westy was (ick) metallic 
blue outside, and house painted brown with a brush inside when I got it. (ick)

Just do the prep work before paint to keep the metal sealed away from the 
weather.

that's my 2 cents.

Hi folks:

My 65 Neunsitzer came to me with primer/rust exterior and a bare cargo
area - no seats, panels (except on rear of cab divider), and
non-original floor mat.

One of these days I'd like to restore it to its original green/white
color with an original interior, but in the meantime I'd like to have a
little fun in an &quot;art car&quot; vein.

For the interior, I think I'll just put in some reasonable looking
plywood paneling -- something remotely resembling Westy birch -- and
build a box seat.  Quick and easy, stands up to cargo loads, and it's
amazing what a little polyurethane can do to cheap wood.  (i.e., make it
look like polyurethaned cheap wood)

For the exterior, I want to do something really eye catching.  Not the
full-on hippie bus treatment (scrawled fonts and flower icons), nor the
70's airbrushed van mural thing -- but something reminiscent of both,
possibly in a Peter Maxx-like style, with a Florida theme (think &quot;Yellow
Submarine&quot; in the tropics).  Maybe a solid (original) color above the
beltline and graphics below.

Another idea for the exterior is something more in the Moderne/Populuxe
style (which would complement the Danish Modern interior).  Sputniks,
stars, atoms, etc.  Since 1965 is a little late for that style, I'd have
to approach it carefully.  Could be a delivery bus for &quot;Hugo's Chrome
Dinettes&quot;.

I think I can do this exterior treatment without seriously bunging up
chances for future stock resto (the original paint is gone, man, solid
gone), and have fun at the same time.  An exercise in Probable Cause. 
And minimizing downtime for the vehicle, which is a heck of a lot more
fun to drive now that I've reconnected the #3 spark plug.

I'd be grateful for inspirations &amp; ideas on both materials and designs.
