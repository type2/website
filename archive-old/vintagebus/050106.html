Subject: '67 Westy available

I have a friend who isn't into working on stuff, but he bought a '67 Westy
last fall 'cuase it was cheap.  Now the novelty has worn off and he wants
to sell it.  It's a walk through with bad rockers and the outer
crossmembers underneath are also shot.  I haven'y gotten a look at the
front floors.  The previous owner took the whole bus apart, patched the
rust (very poorly) with fiberglass, and painted it white.  It looks like
all of the cabinets are in there, as well as the jalousie windows.  There
is no engine.  THe front seats are not VW.  Tranny is there (it's a
roller).  I don't remember if it has a pop top or not, but I can find out
if anyone's interested.  My friend would be happy with $500 for the whole
works.  Let me know if you're interested, or if you have any questions.  My
friend isn't online, but I can ask your questions and get back to you w/
the answers.

P.S.  Oh yeah, the bus is just outside of Saint Paul, Minnesota.
