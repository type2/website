Subject: blower powered heater system part II

Today I hit the local pic a part looking for engine compartment sheet metal
for my '61 DD Panel (a PO hacked it for who knows what) and only 3 bays and a
few bugs. I stuck my head in one bug and saw a fan shroud. A doghouse at that
so when I picked it up hiding under it was the type 2 engine cooling blower I
have been looking for to test out for heating the bus. found it with rubber
insulated bracket and all. Could not test it there (they puill all batteries
out for safety and pollution reasons) but as soon as I hit the garage on a
battery it went. It works great and moves allot of air. I am going to try to
get it installed tomorrow for the Monday run to work.  I drop my room mate off
at her mom's in the morning on my way to work and that will be the real test.
If she ain't griping about being cold on the way we have a winner......lol.
Test results to come.

'61 DD Panel
'62 Kombi Swivel Seat &lt;---- The test vehicle
'66 Meyers Manx
'85 Cabriolet

P.S. If anyone is parting out a bus I am in need of for my '61 the metal
around the engine compartment (both sides, front and battery tray), both front
doors for pull handle (shell or complete), a roof bow w/ flanges for welding
it in place (behind the cargo doors) and an engine hatch door. Thanks
