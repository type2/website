Adrian was exactly right in saying that I might have the coil shorting out somewhere and frying the wires.  The new coil was a little bit skinnier than the original and it slipped down in its clamp and was shorting out on the side of the carb, thus frying the wires.  An hour later, new coil, new wires, the Old '66 fires right up and runs beautifully, purrs like a fiesty kitten!  Thanks all, sorry about the constant barrage of questions on only the second day I've owned the bus but now everything is fine!  Tomorrow, I try my hand at body work!  I am sooooooo glad this list exists!
