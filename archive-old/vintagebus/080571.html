Subject: RE: [VB] Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

Let me first start off being a downer...  If you cannot get a 1914 to work 
then I would not even consider an IRS conversion as it is complicated and 
requires tools and skills that I *think* you probable do not have yet.  Give 
your mechanical experience time to season and then take on the project :)

---

Kits

I would recommend the Bus Boys IRS kit.  They have the adjsutable trailing 
arm mounts that are great...  But still need cutting and grinding to fit 
right!  I used the Old Speed swing plates on my conversion as well as the 
shock mounts.

Also you will need SAW floating axles and T4 CVs with matching flanges.  I 
can just hear the dollars adding up (as I kick myself).

An IRS tranny, I used a 1303 single side plate tall ratio box.

Oh yes and to complicate things I added 944 rear discs as well.  Awesome 
stopping power!

----

Engine

See the &quot;T4rum&quot; on www.shoptalkforums_dot_com for info on converting your 2.0 to 
upright cooling.  They will help you emmensely in that project.  Estimate 
750-1K for that switch.

Right now I am using a warm 1600 in my IRS conversion and it is pathetically 
underpowered.  Granted a 2007 (78.4x90.5) is in the works which will likely 
motivate the Westi a little quicker.

Pluses

On the up side the IRS does ride nicely and I kept it basically stock hight! 
  I like stock height to get off road to camp.

The gearing is great IF I had more power in the motor.  I think I could 
cruise at 75 and be fine.

---

Summary

It is a neat conversion and I enjoyed doing it.  And I think I would do it 
again.  But there is A LOT envolved and was more of a project than I 
intended it to be.  It is all reversable which is a plus to me also.  More 
to come, but I am happy with it.

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
