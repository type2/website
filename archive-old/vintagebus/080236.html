Some buses are just a little hard starting when warm.  I have two 67s.
The 30/31 with a 1679 motor pops right up every time  it has a 110 dizzy
the other(hard starting when warm) has a 34PCT3 and a 009 Dizzy
BUT both run great when they are started  do not try to fix something that
is not broke !!
PS Both have to go through the tough Phoenix emissions test
