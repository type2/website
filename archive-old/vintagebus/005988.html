Subject says it all.  I just went to the local farm place (TSC) and asked
for a syringe capable of holding 50 to 60cc's.  The largest they had was a
60cc so a dollar eighty later, I had my syringe with a handy little carrying
case as well.  I'll post some more details tonight after the cc work.
Later!
