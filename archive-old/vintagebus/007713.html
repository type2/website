Well I think I'm pulling out of this VW slump I was in.  I don't know if it
was winter blahs, discouragement, or what.  I think that more than anything
else, it's the lack of being able to want to work on damn thing but simply
not being able to.  It just takes WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long to get
parts anymore.

A workmate friend of mine from Falls City, NE has said that about a block or
2 from his mother there has been a VW bus sitting for quite a long time.  He
says it is white over red, and with my picture-aided educational speel to
him on the difference between split window and bay window buses, he's
confirmed it's a splittie with the 4 window in the back (like my 66.)  For
X-Mas, he visited his mother in Falls City and so I sent him with a
disposable camera of which 19 shots were taking of the bus.  The engine is
in it and it was last licensed and driven in 1996.  He talked to the
40-something woman who lived there and he asked if the bus was for sale and
she said to make an offer on it.  Since he's not interested, I'm supposed to
get in touch with her personally and check it out.  Brian (my friend) told
me that there is surface rust and he took pictures of the worst areas but
then he said, &quot;But there is none of that big rust thru with holes S*IT like
yours has.&quot;  Well gee thanks.

Anyway, seeings as how I don't have the money, I can still get the pix
developed, check the bus out, and let any busser wannabees know about it.
I'm sure you Lincoln and Omaha, NE VWs would like to get your hands on this
one.  I guess it also has the standard rust around the window frames.  Big
deal.

All for now...more later...
