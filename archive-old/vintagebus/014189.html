As some of you may remember, I've recently acquired a 1960 Microbus in
phenomenally good shape.  However, it didn't come cheaply, so I need
to sell off a couple of other VWs to help pay for it.

The first is a 1966 Microbus.  It's a project bus, particularly as
regards rust.  I'm willing to sell it with or without the engine, but
would rather keep the engine as a spare.  Asking $2,500 with, $750
without.  The engine's only a couple of years old, and the wiring
harness is about a year old.  For pictures, etc, see:

The second is a 1980 Vanagon Westfalia.  It's in pretty much average
shape for a twenty-year-old car.  It comes complete, no haggling over
engines (the engine's about three years old).  Asking $3,500.

Showing and such is being handled by a friend of mine, Isaiah Boothby,
since he works at home and thus has a more flexible schedule for
meeting with people and such than I do.  He's empowered to negotiate
details, test drives, and so on as need be.  His number's 303-682-5190.
Of course, you can contact me, as well, if you have questions that can
be addressed via email.

I'm offering these first to the lists, as the people here are more
likely to know what they're getting into.  If I don't find any takers
in a couple of weeks, I'll do the usual newspaper ads and such.
