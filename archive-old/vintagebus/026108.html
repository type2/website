&lt;&lt; Produces up to 50,000 volts on coil (not included)  (My Note: This is a 
coil
 assist setup - you still need a stock or Bosch coil.)
 Keeps engine in top tune at all times.
 Assures easier starts, better mileage, smoother operation.
 Unique optical system elimates wear - you set the timing ONCE, then forget
 it for the life of your engine.
 Precise timing to within 1/10 of a degree
 Easy, do-it-yourself installation - only 4 wires to hookup

Like many of the &quot;experts&quot; (which I'm not!) on the list have stated in the 
past, this is merely part of the problem. There are many &quot;pointless&quot; systems 
available for VW's. When you complete the system with a CDI module, then 
you've got some real advantages. Also, general consensus is that optical 
sensor systems are not as &quot;bulletproof&quot; as magnetic or &quot;Hall&quot; type sensors.
