Subject: Re:[VB] Do many find the Original Owner?

When I bought my bus it had not been registered since 86 and the person
who had last owned the bus had signed the wrong name on the title. This
left it up to me to find the last registered owner of the bus, who
didn't live at the same address , but had a very unique name so I was
able to find him. I do not beleive he was the original owner, but he did
use the bus all through the seventies for his lawn care service. He was
able to give me a lot of history on the bus, when dents occured, when it
was orriginally converted to twelve volt, when he took it in to a local
shop after pulling the motor in 86 and selling it for 50 bucks. He still
drives the 72 bus that he pulled the motor to put in. It is very cool to
get past history on your bus, and he was more than willing to give it.
He even seemed interested in what changes I had in store for the bus.
