I agree that it would be a great thing if there was such a rag that focused 
completely on vintage type 2's. Over the past while I have noticed that it 
seems vw trends is going seriously downhill with their increasing coverage 
of the watercooled vw's.If they felt that they needed a mag in this subject, 
they should have come out with a mag completely on waterboxers and left the 
old vw trends concept alone.
This leaves only hot vws and they have to still focus on the dune buggy end 
of things, and nothing wrong with that, as they are by far the better mag. 
But it is hard to find alot of stuff on transporters.

To solve everything, I thing thats what we all need- a monthly or by-monthly 
mag devoted to vintage type 2's and nothing else.It sure seems there would 
be a market for it as there are a lot of folks that are into transporters.
