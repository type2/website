Subject: Westy Tent Brackets on eBay

Can someone help clarify the roof mounted tent brackets for early Westfalia's?  My '59 came to me with 2 roof mounted tent brackets, one being the taller bracket and the other being the short bracket.  Then there is the front bumper bracket.  All 3 of which I have.

There is a set of brackets on eBay right now (item #324468860) showing 4 roof brackets.  I've never seen 4 before.  Is this for a later (mid '60's) setup, or am I missing something here?  Two brackets is what you're missing, right!? hehehehe

TIA.

Robert
