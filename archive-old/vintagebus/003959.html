&gt;Steve Dolan from DC is in New Mexico and having some engine problems.  The
&gt;MSHP 2.2 litre he is running in his Vanagon is running hotter than
&gt;acceptable.
&gt;
&gt;This means that he may indeed need another engine.    I will help pay for
it and take care of the cost along
&gt;with some other listy's.  I have comitted 50 bucks to the cause.  HELP IF
&gt;YOU CAN!


Don't know about an engine, but I can help with the fundage.
Put me down for $100. Help should be available in Phoenix, if not before.
Lots of us will be in LA this weekend if he has to go that far.
