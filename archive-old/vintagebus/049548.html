Subject: RE: [VB] early English TRANSPORTER MANUAL reprint

&gt;I have these in stock also, but do not sell them as they are a very bad copy

&gt;&quot;TRANSPORTER WORKSHOP MANUAL, 1955-1967 Reprint of early English
&gt;publication&quot;


I have an 'original' of one of these... my copy is NOT a bad xerox; it came
in a red and gray cover, reading:
&quot;Type II Transporter series 1200-1600 shop Manual&quot; The quality is as good
as the Bentley reprint of the splitty manual. The bitch is that it has NO
publisher, NO ISBN, NO address or identifying mark AT ALL. All I can tell
you is that I got it at Book People here in Austin years ago, when they
were a REAL bookstore; now, without an ISBN, they can't find their own
heads.
Should any other copies turn up, I will snag them for a List buy.

The WW version is apparently a xerox of the title page on.
