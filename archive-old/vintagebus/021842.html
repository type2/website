Hi list,

I was recently gifted a set of original safaris with all the hardware. I
have stripped all the paint, removed all 8 of the frame screws(mangled 1
hole and had to drill it out after the cheesy EZ out broke) and dug out all
the glass to frame rubber to make some clearance.

Question: How do the frames come apart? Do you slide them apart like a sash
window?

I don't want to screw them up by manhandling them so please send over any
suggestions.

ps. they aren't severely rusted and the joins are clearly visible and the
glass is still insisde the frames.

TIA

Michael
