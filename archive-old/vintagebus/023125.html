&gt;I have found adaptors in 60's panel van that were made into campers 
&gt;(riviera?)  they were a square peg with a round hole and a longer screw.

Actually, I have a '63 Riviera non-walkthru camper that, when I bought it,
had no inside cargo door handle on that door.  Drove me nuts.  I figured
who would be stupid enough to go camping and not be able to close that door!

For a temp fix, we took an old cargo door handle that was busted and
fashioned our own adaptor, but it was not the strongest thing.  So I
swapped the locking mechanism and longer handle out of a later cargo door.
It's lovely now!
