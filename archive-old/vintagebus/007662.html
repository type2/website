There's a '65 camper for sale in New Smyrna, Florida, that is &quot;make offer.&quot;
I spotted it in the SEVWC classifieds.  I thought I'd post it since most
people probably don't look there...the name is Rick Cooper, the number is
(904)438-0014.  There are two pictures here:

Looks fairly decent in the pictures, looks like it has some rust.
Interesting that there are *two* mirrors mounted on the driver's side door.
And that's all I know.
