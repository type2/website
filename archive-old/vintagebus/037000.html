         1) Are the blocks that slide in the roof channel supposed to be
 wood. If so does anyone
             make reproductions (or does any one need a set, they look
 easy to make!)
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Those blocks were made of phenolic, a resin and fiber material.  Many a time I
had to machine the material for the VW bus of the sky, the C-130 Hercules
cargo aircraft.  While I was in the USAF working as a machinist.  So I have
very first hand experience with the material.   Eric &amp; Barb
