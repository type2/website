Subject: Re: [VB] westfalia curtin rods

Clara has got me there. My westy has these sliding tracks too- I didn't =
bother to count these as they are pop rivetted to the inside of the cab =
and are therefore rarely removed.

 i did the mental math and came up with 8- one for each of the six window =
and=20
and two for the back window. as menioned westy's came with an (optional?) =
cab=20
divider curtain rod that follows the curved profile of the cab. you tend =
to=20
see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they got to so 42's =
they=20
petered out

some westys came with the sliding curtain track around the windsheilds =
and=20
front door windows.  My 65 has it.
