&gt; Save yer money- you need no machining of case nor heads to fit 2.0p/c to a
1.8^)

Ahh yes!  Glad to hear it.

&gt; Splurge for new stellite 914 exhaust valves or the cheaper stainless
ones....
&gt; Buy a better set of rings than the ones you got in the cofap set. those
soft cast-iron
&gt; rings seat real well but wear out real fast.( Try Deves.)...get the bigger
oil pump....
&gt; Jet those 40 Webers, we're already lookin' forward to that whole
scenario...Dave\X/
&gt; p.s. why don'tcha come on over to the &quot;other&quot; bus list ?  8^P

Well Dave I'm thinking about it.  I might have to get a retarded website
email account someplace and sub through that.  As long as there are some T4
engine gurus on that list, I'll probably take the dive at least for a little
while and see about pilfering some tech info from all the pros. :-)

Anyway, I already planned on a couple differences on this engine vs my 1776
rebuild.  First off, I want total seal rings.  Wished I would have done that
on my 1776 before AND I'm ready to pour money into the heads this time
instead of in other places.  I've been told that www.bostonengine_dot_com does
really good work and was suggested to me numerous times.  I used to read the
Type 4um (but alas it appears that whole web-based message board is down -
I'd sure like to get back on it again.) and people were really putting down
Mark Stephens and his process because as one guy put it, &quot;I got tired of
loosing valve seats while doing a 6g burnout at the line.&quot;  I guess the
equipment and some of the employees have relocated to another business in
the same area but overall, people were bragging up BostonEngine because of
the heads being reworked professionally and never losing valve seats.
That's what I want - a reliable engine that will give a proportionately
larger driving ratio - more miles driven between maintenance necessities.  I
think the T4 will give me that as well as power.

Thanks for the message Dave.
