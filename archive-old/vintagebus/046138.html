Hello Everyone!


    Does anyone know of a good place to get replacement front windshields.

The first rain has come and my windows are in need of replacement. I also

have some rust repair to do and this is becoming more of a daily driver for

me. Also I have replaced the rubber seals between the window frame and the

front doors but they still let water onto the door panels what is the easy

fix on this if anyone has had this problem.


The Rain is attacking from all directions on the Cali Central Coast.

Sincerely

Eric

find out how much glass shop charge to get it cut-   some will do it for 
about $25, 

to make the windows not leak you need new seals, and a good sealing surface.  
  Which means find a covered place to have the windows out for a few days so 
you can wire wheel all the rust away, use rust fix, or weld if neccessary, 
primer, spot putty, sand for smooth surface, primer, paint.   After all that 
is dry, I use roofing tar on the lower lip as a sealant/rust repelant.  And 
oil in between the rubbr seal and the glass.   That also makes it easy to 
install the seal on the glass.    And easy to put the string in the lip for 
pulling the lip over the metal ridge in the bus.

remove the front door panels and get some thick plastic sheeting, cut to 
slightly smaller than the door panel and attach (duct tape works for me) the 
plastic to the door.  It will be hidden when you put the panel back on.   
tuck the bottom of the plastic into the door, this keeps the rain that drain 
through the door from soaking and warping the door panel.  SPlitties came 
with wax paper in there, long gone,  bays did come with plastic on there.  

if it leaks betwen the top and bottom of door, remove top of door, and 
roofing tar both above and below the rubber seal and reinstall.  Get a new 
scraper for the top of the door, it really helps keep drips out.

roofing tar s good roofing tar is better than silicone sealants roofing tar 
is cheap roofing tar cleans up easy with a rag and WD-40 roofing tar repells 
rust roofing tar doesnt dry roofing tar melts and squishes and reseals in hot 
weather roofing tar comes in various size cans roofing tar comes in a tube 
for people who want to use one of those gun things.roofing tar has helped my 
windows not leak
