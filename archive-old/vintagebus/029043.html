This is our third year putting on this show. It is a two day event this year. We also have a 1975 Porsche 914 to raffle off (must be present to win). Saturday August 12, meet at the Ranch Drive in _at_ 3:00 p.m. Cruise to Georges field to set up camp around 6:30. On to the Drive in movies at dusk. The actual show is on Sunday August
13, from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. This show is about driving VW's not just show VW's. We strongly request that anyone who drives a VW puts it in the show. There are 12 awards available and almost none of them have to do with being a show car. We want people to have time to talk about their cars and pass on tech tips and great
adventures instead of polishing their backing plates. There will also be a swap area. The show is held in the parking lot across from the Full Sail brewery in lovely down town Hood River OR. This is located one hr east of Portland OR (directions follow). Spectators are free and the show or swap fee is $10 which includes one
raffle ticket. Raffle tickets are a suggested donation of $5 for one or a suggested family size donation of $20 for 10 tickets. There are lots of other prizes as well including some NuTech bug running boards, a NoLimitz Snowboard and lot's more. Please join us for this VW Social event all of the proceeds are donated to The Next
Door which does all kinds of family counsiling and placement of troubled youth.

We look forward to seeing you all and drive careful,
Craig
