Subject: no brakes
Message-ID: &lt;t962991184c3_at_d701302117.iopener_dot_net&gt;

no rocket sience here,when your brake shoe or pad are hot or wet you will not stop as well.don't know how many on the list watch nascar or other forms of racing on tv .when the cars are on a short track and have to apply th brakes more the less effective the brakes will be,like going down pikes peak they have places for you to pull off and let your breaks cool before traveling on.the rotors on the stock cars will be glowing bright red in a real short track race,and these guys use the most technical materials known to man.																																																		paul																																					61	single cab
