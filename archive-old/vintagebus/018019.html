The bit about the 18 year old son reminds of a story I
heard about a fellow who collected Corvettes (not
everyone can have the good taste we share on this
list), and never let his kids even help wash them when
the kids were young, for fear of them scratching
something or leaving a water stain.  Of course, when
the kids were older and the father wanted them to
share his interest in his cars, they hated the things,
and wanted nothing to do with cars as a hobby.

Moral of the story: Let the kids help, start them
young, even if they make mistakes; keep them
interested.  Help them grow up to be someone you want
to leave that treasured VW bus to.
