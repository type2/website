&gt; &gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; &gt; As long as this is done in an instant it is not a bad thing.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly which is why I specified that you switch your foot from the brake to
&gt; the gas when you take off.  Never should one ever have the clutch out and
&gt; brake on for extended periods of time.

I like to use the heel and toe method.  Heel of the right foot on the brake and
toe over on the gas pedal.

I can firmly apply the brake and run the gas at the same time.  Takes a little
getting used to and practice but it's do-able.

We missed the parking lot practice that was planned for this weekend, my
daughter came down with the flu and is running 101-102 fever.  She was
refereeing a volleyball game yesterday and a couple of the dad's took offense at
one of her calls.  She stood her ground like a pro and almost had the guys
removed from the game.  The site director later confirmed that her call was
correct.  Not bad for a 15 yr. old.  She said that the guy's were lucky that she
wasn't feeling all that great.

So it's to the parking lot for driving lessons next weekend.

Scott
