Subject: Any Virginia Area Bussers Want to Help?

Hi Volks,
I am getting a little desperate here.  I need to pick up the '66 Deluxe
in Toano, VA on Saturday and can't find any help to load the splittie on
the trailer.  If anyone can spare some time on Saturday, I would
appreciate it.  I was planning to arrive in Toano around 11:00 from
Philly.  I know there are a few bussers in the Richmond and Newport News
area, please lend a hand.  There is suppose to be a local BBQ place that
is great, my treat!
