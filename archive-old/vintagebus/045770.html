&lt;&lt;  tried them out today with not too many problems. Due to my Panels
lowered height I had to make brackets that mount the tent to the rack
instead of the roof. Because of this I have to lengthen the poles that
mount to the bumpers, but otherwise I'm looking good. Look for me and my
new tent at Kelly Park. &gt;&gt;

Just run it in the stock location and let it drag the ground.
Haven't you seen the raver (I called em &quot;housers&quot;)kids and their SUUUUUPER 
baggy pants covering their shoes?
Thats the latest STYLE!!!!!!!!!!
