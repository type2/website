&lt;&lt; I installed a urethane front tranny mount in my baby today.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
&gt;From what we have heard this type of material for a tranny mount transmits 
most of the vibration, and thusly noise to the VW body.   

&lt;&lt;Also, someone asked the list a couple of weeks ago how to center the 
steering wheel on a splitty. I never saw any responses to the query. The 
steering wheel doesn't have splines like the later models do. It has a 
woodruff key, which means the adjustment must be made down below, I 
suppose...&gt;&gt;
First on a bus that has not been taken apart/built by you.  Take the spindles 
off of the trailing arms, and pop out the link pins one at a time to inspect, 
and clean any old grease/dirt/rust out of them.  Then make sure to clean out 
the out plug covers for them.  All too often we have found the link pins 
gooped up with old paste/dirt, and this does not allow the new grease to get 
to the needle bearings.  Next inspect the shims for the link pins, and make 
sure that they are not too worn (If they are replace them.) or the right 
amount on either side of each link pin.  If you have recently rebuild or 
built all of the previous stuff already then check, and set the toe in of the 
front wheels.  Then, and only then change the drag link length to get the 
front wheels straight with the steering wheel/box centered in the middle of 
it's turns.  Not just so the steering wheel is straight!  Then tighten the 
steering box lock nut to take almost all of the slack out of the steering box 
when you have found the turning center of the box.
  The only time one should ever remove the pitman arm to reinstall it at a 
differant angle on the steering box splines is after all of the previous 
preperations/adjustments have been finished.  To reinstall the pitman arm so 
that it does not end up or even close to straight with the shaft of the drag 
link when the steering box is at it either of the points where it is full 
left/right or between these points.  If the pitman arm gets even close to 
straight to the drag link expect the steering to at the least to get very 
hard to move or even to lock up!
