Subject: Re: [VB] Won't run with lights on

I had a similar problem once when my bus died when I turned on the 
headlights.   

My problem was bad generator brushes, ie no charging.  I suspect that 
something is wrong in your charging system.  I'd check to see how many volts it out 
put (Idiot book has procedure) then check and clean all connections from 
generator to battery including regulator and test again.   

It doesn't tale a lot of electricity to run a bus.  It's those accessories 
like lights that need it.

&lt;&lt; Dear Listees:
 
 I have a  problem that I haven't seen addressed on this list before. My 6
 volt bus runs fine during the day, but when I turn the lights on the engine
 starts missing badly.
 Does anyone know what the problem is???
 Thanks in advance.
