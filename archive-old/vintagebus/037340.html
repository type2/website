any one ever heard such a thing.  i guess that would be your standard micro
with a 21/23 deluxe roof on it.  defenitly not original i am guessing.  Some
guy named &quot;MARZDE_at_aol_dot_com&quot; clams to have one.  But anyway just curious this
isn't some really weird original thing.

do you mean a bus with a sunroof and skylight windows, but only three side
windows?  In that case it would be a non deluxe wiith a roof transplant.   I
have seen one or two.  They did make standard micros with sunroofs, but they
did not have skylight windows.
