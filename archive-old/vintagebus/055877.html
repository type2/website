Subject: RE: [VB] pop-out latch refurbishment?

- The little white knobs should unscrew or at least one of the does... or at
least the black knobbed latches of an early double cab do...

- push the pin out holding the pieces together.  Go down and buy a correct
punch as they should only be abut 3-5 dollars each.

- Reassemble with metric split pins.  I'm about to do mine for the 59 double
cab and I've been searching for the correct drill size as after chroming the
holes are not the correct size.

- When chroming things like this, make sure you take everything apart...
chroming doesn't work if stuff is still together and if your chromer is
anything like mine, he'll work with your parts just as you give them to him.
My guy is very meticulous but he still will not disassemble anything beyond
what you give him.

- I don't think I would powder coat these parts as the coating is rather
thick and I don't think things would fit back together correctly... Maybe
someone else knows better.

Chris asked:
Hello fellow bus drivers - can someone please explain how to refurbish
regular short pop-out latches. I have a dozen or so in various
conditions, some broken pieces, bad chrome, etc. I was thinking I could
at least put together the best pieces to make a few good ones. Do the
little white knobs pull off or unscrew ( I've tried twisting them with no
luck ) and to take apart the pivoting parts would you drill out the hinge
pin rivet thing? Then could it be put back together with a tension pin?
On the good parts that just have bad chrome, what can be done? Can chrome
be removed, and then could they be powder coated instead of chromed?
