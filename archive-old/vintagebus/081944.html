Subject: Re: [VB] info wanted about 1500 &amp; 1600 split screen bus scripts

I think the 1600 is a t3 item as in 1600TL and the like. The 1500 was like you said first available in '63 and was standard in the US in 65 as far as buses are concerned. 
 
If anyone has any extra 1500 badges let me know I could use a few.

Looking for a T3!!
