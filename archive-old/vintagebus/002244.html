Alright..got the bottom two 17mm nuts out..that was easy. The next two, the
ones on top. Reach around behind the fan housing and loosen them, thats the
name of the game, right? HA! Funny joke, I bet you're all sniggering (thanks
Eric&amp;Barb) as you read this.
&quot;HeeheheehahahHAHAH! He's talking about those two bolts on top that are a
royal pain in the *insert expletive*!&quot;
Ok. So whats the deal here? Can't get a breaker bar anywhere. don't relish
the idea of trying to loosen them underneath as I don't want an air cooled
engine case shaped cavity in my ribcage, and I can't even see where they are
to spray free all on them. So am I the victim of a cruel joke, am I missing
something, did the one guy who pulled my engine for a clutch job think he'd
be funny and tighten them with an air ratchet, or what? The bottom two came
off easy, these top two are still laughing at my fuitile efforts to free
them as we speak. Thanks for any help.
