Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Synthetic oil testing

Oil heated up by the heads doesn't provide as much heat back to the case as
you would think.  Realize that the combustion is not just taking place
against the head, but on the other side, you have an aluminum piston, which
is taking a lot of heat, but, unlike the head, there is no cooling fins, or
a cool intake charge, on the piston, so MUCH of it's heat is going through
the wrist pin, down the connecting rod, right to the crank, etc, etc....
And you have oil 'hurricaining'(sp?) around in the case, taking heat off
these items continually, with much more surface area with the oil that what
is offered in the heads.  When you're cruising down the road in your bus,
the crank whipping around creates an 'oil hurricane', and all that oil is
constantly moving across the hot metal parts taking a good portion of heat
with them.

I would LOVE to see some side by side results of an engine without, and
with, the combustion chamber and exhaust port of the head ceramic coated,
and the top of the piston ceramic coated, versus not coated.  I hear it's
the new thing being done with the HP engine's.  Anyone here seen results of
it?

&gt; Was writ: &quot;The head temp is only a part of the equation.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;   OK, here's the basic facts as I see it:  The hottest part of the engine
is
&gt; where the combustion takes place: the combustion chamber (cylinder head),
&gt; outer most part of the cylinders and the top part of the piston.  The
motor
&gt; oil in an air cooled VW motor is heated primarily by passing through the
&gt; cyl. heads and then back to the case.
&gt;  So, if using dino oil, the oil temps are 'higher' but the heads are
cooler
&gt; as
&gt; compared to syn. oil, the dino oil would still be the oil of choice.
&gt; If we can prove that syn. oil does in fact keep the &quot;heads&quot; cooler I'm all
&gt; for it.
&gt; The main part of the engine that must be cooled is the heads all else is
&gt; secondary.  If I had a head temp gauge I'd do the testing, I'll see if
&gt; Ronnie
&gt; has one in stock tomorrow.  Havasu's temp was well over 100 deg. today.
