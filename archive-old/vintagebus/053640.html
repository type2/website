Subject: Re: parts cleaning method?

&gt;From: Jason Elm &lt;jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I was asking a friend about rebuilding a carb, and
&gt;wether he recommended those &quot;paint bucket&quot; parts
&gt;cleaners.

I've used them and they work pretty well, but the
chemical stinks (use it outside) and will straighten
out your DNA (wear gloves).  If you have a completely
gunked-up carb, try and scrape the really huge chunks
out of it before you put it in the bucket.  Don't
tear up the carb, or scratch the gasket surfaces, etc,
but getting the big chunks out helps the cleaner get
to the rest of the carb.  I have worked on a carb that
needed two trips through the bucket to get really
clean.

&gt;Take a big pot of water, get it to boiling on the
&gt;stove, pour one and a half lemons worth of lemon
&gt;juice in there, put the part in and let it boil
&gt;for ten minutes.  Of course he took the carb apart
&gt;first, removing all the delicate parts.

I've never tried this, but it sounds plausible.  The
lemon juice is mostly citric acid, a mild acid, and
the heat helps loosen up the gunk in the carb.  My
concern with this would be erosion or pitting on the
jets or the gasket surfaces - the jets are easy enough
to take out beforehand, though.  I think this acid
is probably mild enough that tearing up the gasket
surfaces wouldn't be a big concern.

As you mentioned the pot will probably get trashed.
Since the pot will probably have traces of oil,
gasoline, and a lemon-fresh scent, it's probably best
to do this with a pan that will never be used in the
kitchen again.
