&gt; Hello again VW enthusiasts,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I got your messages about how VW has been treating the enthusiast community and I've certainly learned from this.  The last time I had an aircooled VW was the early 90's.  My current aircooled beetle is being restored by someone in another state (I don't have a garage).  So, this issue hasn't had not affected me - thus, my ignorance.

Laura,

Thank you for letting VWOA know how we feel regarding their lack of
business ethics and foresight. Those of us who've been dealing with this
issue for a while (I've owned my 67 bus for 30 years now) have strong
feelings about it, and I for one, got a good chuckle reading all of the
attached correspondence that you sent with your letter to our list. It's
about time they got a little of what they've been dishing out.

Thaks again and keep in touch with the vintage community!
