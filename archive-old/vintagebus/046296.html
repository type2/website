Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for Clamps for rack
To: Turkisbus_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Real clamps are nice, but you can also go to the hardware store and get 4 
turnbuckles, and grind the one end so it fits under the rain gutter flatly, 
the other end hooks ove rthe edge of the rook.   Use a hose clamp to hold it 
to upright leg of rack for stabilisation.   
No, it's not as pretty, might not want to use this on fresh paint/shiny bus.
........but it will help a rack be functional.  I have used this method for 
many miles with stuff piled on rack w/o problems, but not since my bus got 
paint.  Then I sorted out a rack w/ real clamps and material to keep it from 
scratching the paint.

 I am looking for some clamps for my rack. It is hard to describe racks by 
 words, but here goes. It is a genuine VW rack, can tell by the sticker on 
it. 
 It is the taller of the metal racks and has no provisions on the rack itself 
 for clamps. It is made of thinner material that the &quot;conduit appearance&quot; of 
 the industrial racks. Bars run only from side to side of bus, no front to 
 rear bars. The clamps look like three pieces, a hook for the drip rail, a 
 &quot;two hook claw&quot; for the rack, and a threaded piece that joins the two 
 together and is tightened by a placing a screwdriver or something similair 
 and turning. Need these please, if you have any questions about what kind of 
 rack I have and you might have clamps, please P-mail me. I will try to find 
a 
 picture of what I am describing.
