Subject: Re: [VB] Bumper splash Pan Seals
Message-ID: &lt;0.3bf138bc.2565a0ee_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Are these splash pan seals for 59-67 or pre-58? Or are they all the same?
I *thought* that the 59-67 ones were more complex than the early ones.
Anyone found an alternative seal to use for the ribbed bumper splash pans?

Aaron-
The &quot;bumper splash pans&quot; go on the rear bumper on the corners. In between the 
bumper and the body. These too most busses are missing.

&lt;&lt;Pardon my ignorance, but I don't know what a Bumper Splash pan is.  I've 
heard the
term used over the last few days on the list, but I don't know what it is.  I 
know
what the splash pan is, the big piece that most busses are missing, that 
covers up
the front steering and brakes and other front important parts.  Is this the 
same
thing?
