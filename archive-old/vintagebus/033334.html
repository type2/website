Subject: DARRYL'S LICENSE PLATE RESTO
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone had problems?
I sent my plates in back in SEPTEMBER for a resto with an E.T.A. of 8 weeks!
Their ad says open M-F 10-5 E.S.T. with a lunch in between 12-1. 
I try calling the phone number, Its busy ALL DAY LONG except during 12-1 and 
after five! Like they leave the phone off the hook!
Im getting PISSSSED!
No plates means the bus doesnt drive! Or come out of the garage!
Let me know if anyone else is having similar problems.
Regards, Greg
