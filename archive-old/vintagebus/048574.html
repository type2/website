Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?

A word of caution from someone who has been there, it is easy to get
&quot;sucked&quot; into the VW addition.  I can talk about it now after my therapy
sessions.

My problem started as yours did, it wasn't what is in your garage, but
rather HOW MUCH is in your garage.

When I built my house, I decided a 3 car garage would be enough for a shop
and to store a couple cars in.  The wife could put her car in the 3rd space.

But now the shop area got bigger, with the welder, lathe, tubing bender
(race car cages), tool box, table saw and on and on, so now the busses sat
outside.

Didn't like the busses outside, so I built a carport and the wife and I
parked under the carport.

But the busses and parts kept coming.

Next was a 24x40 two story metal barn with an upstairs for parts storage
and downstairs for busses, tractors, caterpillar.......you know, big boy
toys.

But the busses kept coming.

Dad decided that he and I could share a second barn for his Model T's and
Model A's together, so we built a 30x50 steel barn.

But the busses kept coming.

So now I explain to dad how valuable these busses are and we REALLY NEED to
build just one more barn, so up goes the 3rd steel barn 30x50.

But the busses kept coming.

By now the wife has left me and I have at least 30 busses sitting outside.
At least when she left, she didn't take any of my busses!!  I am getting
help and I am trying to sell off a few busses so I don't have to build
another barn!

But I really don't regret a thing, I love the busses, have saved a bunch
from the crusher and have a wonderful daughter out of the deal!  The wife
turned out to be more of a upper class snob than a down to earth VW person
anyway.

Hey, better go, one more hour and I'm off to the Josh Rogers campout in the
little yellow '76 Westy!  (great therapy)



&gt;It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the topic I proposed a couple of
&gt;days ago.
&gt;Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own experience, I realized long
&gt;ago that my garage will probably never hold my &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my garage
&gt;now resides the following:
