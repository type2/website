&gt;I was in an antique store this weekend and spied a VW bus in the
&gt;matchbox
&gt;cars. It is a single cab flat bed with a working plastic elevator
&gt;scaffold
&gt;looking thing with a rotating top platform. It pulls up to about 2
&gt;times the
&gt;normal height. I thought is was remarkable that the plastic part was
&gt;there
&gt;unbroken. It says Husky and made in Great Britain on the bottom.
&gt;Anyone know
&gt;how old it probably is? Anyone seen one?
Hey Rick,
That's the classic Husky Elevator truck. Does it have gray wheels or 
black? I think that model came in both with gray wheels being older. 
It's made in the 60s. There's also a (usually) white single cab with 
a conveyor belt on it from the same series.
Cool toy!
