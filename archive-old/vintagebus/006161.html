Just a short note that I'll be in OKC on Sunday, the 29th picking-up my
&quot;new&quot; purchased Bus. Haven't seen it yet. All I know is that it's an
original, one owner 1965 white/sealing wax red with almost no motor (case
and some tin) and that it's been sitting in some barn since late seventies.
The guy is does not know if it's a Kombi, Standard or DeLuxe. I don't want
to pressure him, I'll just go and get it. For the money he's asking I  won't
ask any more questions. Hope it's as described. Will keep everyone posted.

Thanks,

Andre

of
&gt; OKC. We could work something out.
