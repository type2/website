NO, my number is still behind this one so I'm OK here. Hey, I was just
wondering! Thanks for all the answers.

&gt; it was changed april 64, at ch 1 285 211, thus was a mid year change,
&gt; actually near the end of the model year, actually.  So most 64s have the
kick
&gt; side to side bit rather than the up and down lever to change from foot to
&gt; defrost heat.  Yes same kick panel used as a 63.   now you will say your
vin
&gt; is 800 after that change number, and why is that happening?????
