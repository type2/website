Personally, I like Kaybayo's daily ebay post.  It keeps me from searching
through the 14+ pages on ebay everyday.  On the days or times i dont care
about ebay, its pretty easy to just delete something.  Its not like these
posts dont come with subject lines. Ever try using the mail sorting
functions on your mail client?  Just have it delete the OT or ebay words in
the subject line.  These complaints are pretty trivial.  Try working in the
IT field where your on multiple lists that have upwards of 500 posts daily.


Kabayo, Congrats on the MR2 and thanks for the daily ebay scoop.

&gt; I'm sorry,
&gt; 
 but not only did you
&gt; advertise your mr2 on the bus list, you posted about it yet again.
&gt; 
&gt; this is NOT why i subscribe to this list,
&gt; 
&gt; thank you,
&gt;

I have to second that feeling. 

I unsubscribed for a while when vintagebus turned into ebay-watch. Do we
really need all the ebay notices? Seems like there are enough posts
already.... and since we ask people to look at the archives before
posting questions, since they are capable of answering their own
questions without flooding the list-- isnt it also fair to ask that
folks do their own ebay-searching? I could sure do wihout the daily
&quot;good stuff? You decide&quot; posts.
