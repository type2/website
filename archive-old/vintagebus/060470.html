Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

Kevin-
Front is front ( OK ? :)
The front bearing has lost it's clamping force from the case.
This is also in the oil circuit, so pressure will suffer.
The case passes oil pressure through the tightly held bearings
Any movement also means the case dowel holding that bearing is not.
The crankshaft will whip at this end and damage will escalate.
Best time for a minimal line-bore is now.

&gt; Oh really? That would be outstanding if I didn't have to rebuild it. I
didn't check the front
&gt; bearing (how do you do that with the case together and the oil slinger in
the way?). I was told to
&gt; take the flywheel off, take the seal out and move the crankshaft back and
forth in the case and feel
&gt; the rear bearing for movement. When I did this the rear bearing did move
but only .001 to .002 in.
&gt; In fact it is hard to tell that the bearing is moving at all but after
doing it a number of times, I
&gt; can feel a very slight movement.
&gt;
&gt; The shims are .010, .008 and .011 in. One of them has a groove worn in it
where the flywheel was
&gt; turning against it. The mechanic I was talking to said this wear on the
shim is a symptom of too
&gt; much end play.
&gt;
&gt; Do you think I should just re-shim it and keep on truckin'?

&gt; I wouldn't be to quick to condemn a motor with that amount of end play.
spec
&gt; is .003 to .005&quot;.  yours if not far out and could probably be safely
&gt; reshimmed.  I'd take into account other factors- how is the compression,
does
&gt; the front main bearing move?  what amount of shimmage does it already
have?
