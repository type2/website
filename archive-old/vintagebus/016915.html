Subject: [VB] replacing dimmer relay probs.
Date: Sun, 02 Jul 2000 16:10:12 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

The other day my brights/dims (dims/even dimmer) relay stopped working, but 
if I held it up I could still get my dims to work.  The next day it was 
either brights or nothing if I held it up, but the relay still wouldn't 
click.  So I bought a new relay from WCM.  The original relay had 4 prongs, 
and the new one has 5.  I figured out a way to get it to work, but I don't 
know if I'll fry something by doing this.  Has anyone ever encountered this 
before? I'm guessing yes.  Here's the numbers by each of the prongs.

Thanks and Happy driving--Chet
