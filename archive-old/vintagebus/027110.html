Subject: 1776 installed and roadtested today

Hello Friends,

I finished putting my new engine together last night, and got up early
and installed it this morning. I drove it back and forth to work (20
miles round trip), then hauled my old 1641 down to Athens, GA (230 miles
round trip) to swap in my old engine for the dead engine in my
daughter's 72 superbeetle.

I was impressed with how much more power I now have, especially on
hills. I'm giving serious thought to building a freeway flier...

I had to transfer lots of parts from one engine to the other. While
tightening the nuts on the oil pump, one of the studs felt like it was
about to pull the threads out. Being short of time (I promised my
daughter I would fix her bug this evening), I figure I'll keep an eye on
the oil and fix the offending stud in the next few days...

During all this driving, I've gotten lots of oil drops on the back of
the bus. I've had this before, when an oil cooler broke. The oil cooler
is in the path of the fan airflow of course, but the oil pump is not, so
I'm wondering if I can blame all these drops on on the oil pump, or if I
should start looking for other reasons... 

The top of the case is dry on the left side, which tells me that the oil
cooler is probably not at fault. The pushrod tubes look dry, as well.
The bottom of the case is pretty oily, though.

I'm gonna pull the engine back out probably next week and do some
cosmetic stuff to it, so I'll have a chance to fix whatever needs
fixin',  but I was just wondering what y'all thought about the oil pump
leak/ oil drop question...

david
