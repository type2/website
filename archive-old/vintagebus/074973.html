Subject: RE: [VB] Shipping bumpers to Europe

  When I ship my fiberglass repo's to Europe I just put them in a bicycle
box and send them to my forwarder in Phoenix to go on a direct flight. If I
was closer to a major airport I would just take them to an airline frieght
depot that has non stop flights to the nearest city where they need to go to
and have the purchaser pick them up there. Surprisingly inexpensive. It cost
me as much to ship to Phoenix and pay the forwarder fee as it cost to ship.
The best thing is they have them next day!!

Subject: [VB] Shipping bumpers to Europe


Has anyone every shipped a set of bumpers from the US to Europe?  Due to the
size, I'm not sure how to go about doing this, who to use, etc..

Tips welcome...
