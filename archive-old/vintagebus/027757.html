Subject: Engine case help

I just got around to tearing down the motor that came with my deluxe.
20,000 miles on it.  Yah right.  Looks like they used sand for an
additive inthe oil.  talk about some grooved bearings.  Anyway, i have a
few Q's for you all.

First off, i am a 40HP guy and do not have a whole lot of experiance
with 1600 motors.  This case is a Mexican case with a lot of holes i do
not recognize. (a use for that is)   Anyway, the front bearing (pulley
side) froze a little.  The dowel pin hole in the case is a slot now.
About a diameter and a half long.  I know i can get that welded.  The
case is .020 over right now.  Anyway, is there anything else o should
look for on these cases?  There is no serial # so i can not date the
thing.  Anything weird i should know before i let the machine shop weld
and cut away.

Also,  I am going to build up a 1500/1600 motor.  (1600 gut's and look
like a stock 1500)  Anyway, is there anything tin wise that might be
different if i use this case?  Are there many differences between a 1500
and a 1600 SP tin set.

This is going to be a motor for a sunday driver bus.  Nothing fancy.
Just stock.

Thanks for the help.
Matthew
