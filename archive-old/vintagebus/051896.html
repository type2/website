Subject: RE: [VB] Buses by the Bridge VI

  Well, BBB VI was a great success. We were sad for the people that couldn't
make it, as this seemed to be one of the best BBB's yet. We had a registered
total of over 170 buses camping out. The event was spread out over a larger
area so everyone had all the room they needed. 
  The raffles were all great and the London Bridge Bullis would like to
thank all of the companies, vendors and private individuals that donated to
the raffle. For those of you who don't know all of the profits of this event
go to the Arizona Children's Foundation and stays in our city.
  There are hundreds of pics linked off of my site www.oldvolks_dot_com and I
will be adding a link to the Buskatiers pics also, for those that want to
see what they missed. http://204.26.80.78:8084/bbbvi/03/bbbvi3.html#4
  There is so much to tell but I'm tired. One thing though Harry Houck won
the TURN KEY rebuilt 1600 engine!!
