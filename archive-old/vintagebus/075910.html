&gt; well, clean out those head/cylinder fins.  I wouldn't bother pulling the 
&gt; heads, but that's me.

Hi Kevin,
We agree with Clara!!  Additionally we would retorque ALL the engine 
fasteners.  Starting with the big eight nuts on the right side of the engine case on 
through the 13mm headed nuts bolts that hold the engine case together, and 
finally the heads.  Definitely only drive it short distances for the first 300 
miles and only thirty minutes at a time and at least fifteen minutes between 
trips will help keep the firction heat from all the parts polishing back in from 
loosing a oil sludge avalanche from clogging the oil cooler and oil passages.  
Would be a good idea to install a oil/filter pump though most of these will 
not fit with a stock muffler without modification.
