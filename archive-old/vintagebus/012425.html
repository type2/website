Ah! so that's what you were doing... I thought that your motor was about to
blow up after missing a shift. Did you mistake second gear for fourth at
60mph? I heard a noise and noticed your panel in my peripheral vision. I was
about to reach for the pepper spray and throw the Baygen windup radio (with
light) at you!  Dang! I couldn't keep up as I was running a vacuum dizzy,
didn't know it was a race, had traffic 20 feet in front of me and had Sean
&quot;Hormel&quot; Seitz in the bus.
How can you expect me to keep up with a fully loaded panel with those
factors working against me? Well that's really not fair-the vacuum dizzy was
no problem.

For the record: 1600 DP, 34PICT, Vacuum dizzy, oil bath aircleaner,
header-w/single QP.
