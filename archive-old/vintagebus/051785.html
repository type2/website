Subject: RE: [VB] correction

fair enough--to each his own. i guess i'll go outside, sit on a lawn chair,
drinking a spaten, watching the sunset over the yard full of boring
original vehicles (56 euro 'vert bug, 61 flipseat westy, 67 hardtop deluxe,
65 ghia, 59 hatchtop westy, 62 dd panel), wishing and hoping for the chrome
fairy to come and bless me.

my phrase has been &quot;refurbished&quot; for years now.
hey ronnie, where was the heat in havasu? it's warmer here on the coast!

&gt;    So we are back to the same old thing vintage, OG, a so called resto, of
&gt; which most are just reconditioned (my new phrase, for all the so-called
&gt; restored buses out there). or just a plain old original rust bucket, like
&gt; most of mine.
&gt; but everything is the way I I I I I want it.
