Subject: Re: Round tool boxes/ft. bus emblems

Was at S#T# and Classic and carefully checked out the round tool kits
and the repo chrome front emblems. I held each in my hands. The tool kit
is a steal for $89.95, if you are the least bit picky, go ahead and pay
$650.00 to $800.00 for a NOS one ( there were a bunch for sale in that
price range ). The repo chrome front emblem is close to perfect, a bit
thinner on the sheet metal and they have mounting studs with threads on
them. I always silicone my front emblems on so if you must steal it you
can pull it off without denting up my front end. I did not see any repo
front emblems for BD'S. At $39.95 each for chrome these were a steal 
also. I think this guy will be able to retire off us in a few years. To
Everret: The word is that Mr.S$T$ was offering S#T# to a few people
for 10K. Where would he get all those super deals if it is sold? Maybe
he has already made enough. ( I only repeat what most people won't say )
