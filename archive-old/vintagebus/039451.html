&gt; &gt;Nothing great, just a Kombi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;WTF?!?  I challenge you to a duel!
&gt;
&gt;Everett
&gt;'55 Kombi
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hahahahahahahahahahahaha Ah, The list what could be better? Good 
&gt;one....Yahoo ate the email I was going to send so you get this cut down one 
&gt;here...lucky you!     All the info on this site is great and all the people 
&gt;that give out info are the best! But it would be sad just to see facts only 
&gt;and no personality...For us newbies friday is the day for 5 word contests 
&gt;and some fun.So Newbies sit back(that's me too) enjoy the ride!And be glad 
&gt;this list is just not some computer fact machine spitting out bumper bolt 
&gt;sizes for a Low life Kombi.....hahaha easy big boy...I love them all....Oh, 
&gt;My bus I see it out there and no body is working on her!...Ronnie...Got 
&gt;those floor mats in Blue?....Why do I hear music? Somewhere over the 
&gt;rainbow way up ....Man he's high!
