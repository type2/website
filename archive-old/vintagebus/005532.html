&gt;but if you break the cam and lifters in properly (run for
&gt;20 mins at 2000 rpm)AND your valve chain geometry
&gt;is set up properly it should be fine for the trip.
&gt;
&gt;I'd just pull em out
&gt;next time you have the engine out (after 3000 miles to check
&gt;head bolt tension?)


The cam and lifters were broke in with stock springs in the stock heads.  I
ran the engine at 2500 rpm for a tad over 20 minutes.  I was discussing
things with my brother tonight and how I wasn't going to go and he said,
&quot;BULLSH*T!&quot;  He told me that there is nothing in the Berg literature to
substantiate the wearing down of the cam lobes with dual springs and that
dual springs aren't that much more power over the stock springs - they ARE
stronger - but not in a cam failure sort of way.  Kevin also said that it's
a lottery - you don't know until it happens if your cam is going out so he
said just run the damn thing and see what happens.  I threw the rocker shaft
back on, gapped the valves for the 50th time, slapped on the valve cover,
ran the wire for the oil temp guage and took off for Lincoln with my 2
brothers and sister.  The oil temps at first were about 195 to 210 and then
they settled in a a solid 180 give or take 5 for hills, etc.  About 20
minutes from home, I had to let my brother drive because I got too tired.
He was booking right along (actually driving it floored) and said the oil
temps never got above 200F.  I told him to give 'er hell anyways because if
it's gonna break down, I want it to break down here at home.  My youngest
brother said the engine kind of started getting loud near the end and I
heard it too.  Not sure what it was.

The dual webers have a pretty neat sound but the valve train noise was
horrendous.  I know that .004 is too much and that I should probably get the
gap down to a loose .000 or at least a loose .0015 - god it drove me nuts
and that was even after cruising about 75 to 80 miles tonight.  Geesh.

I'm leaking oil as well.  It's coming from the Melling and the deep sump
area (it figures).  I'm gonna check a few things tomorrow night before
packing up to see where some of the other leaks are coming from (looks like
the alternator stand might be seeping too.)

The engine doesn't seem to have a lot more power than the 1600DP I had in
but I assume that as it loosens up, the power will come back because the
engine isn't having to work so hard to just keep itself running.  It is nice
after a long drive that you can let off the pedal and like clockwork it zips
right back to idle again without flinching.

So I think I can make it to BNNTA in this bus but if I find a deal on a DC,
I'd still trade off all this hard work in an instant.  I've come to
appreciate the stock setups on buses.   Performance stuff belongs in bugs
and notches I think. :-)

See you in Missouri.
