Subject: Want to buy/borrow interior panels...
Mime-Version: 1.0


I need a set of the upper rear panels from a standard to use as a template
cutting new ones.  The condition isn't that important, they just have to be
straight enough to use a pattern.  

Or, if someone already has a pattern, that would be cool too...

Thanks!
