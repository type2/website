***********************************************
1.  Where was the Sundial Camper Factory?

2.  Were there any manuals or brochures for this
conversion?

3.  I am in the process of setting of
www.sundial-camper_dot_com on host pro(had a couple of
accounts I wasn't using) a web site that will contain
as 
much sundial camper info as I can find.  There are
very limited resources on this camper.  Would anyone
be interested in this?

Bart
I have information on the Sundial Camper conversations
that I would be glad to share with you for a web site.

A couple of years ago there was a Sundial Registration
Web Site that disappeared, maybe someone knows
whatever happened to that  -list, any ideas?-
I drive a 67 Sundial that is still in all original
condition and have a great copy of an original Sundial
brochure.

Let me know if I can help
