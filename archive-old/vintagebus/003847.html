&gt; At the BBB IV i gave the uncle jerry jess award to Brian of the VTO
&gt; club--

I saw the bus. Amazing that it made it, but not particularly unsafe as buses
go. A teenager in a Camaro is infinitely more dangerous. Brian isn't a
newbie to buses, he's been around at most of the shows I've been to in the
last couple of years. The bus was dragged out of a field a few days before
the show and he worked day and night on it to get it there. From all of the
Jerry Jess awards I've seen given, I would say that bus definitely met the
criteria and would have been my choice too had I been picking it for Jerry.
For people to say that there was something wrong with that is certainly
their right, but if there is some standard of repair that we all must meet
before driving our buses I'd like to know what it is. How many of you have
driven around with a leaky master cylinder for awhile? How many of you are
driving around in a bus with flex hoses for the brakes of uncertain vintage?
If it has been more than two years in my opinion your bus is a hazard to
all, but there are a lot of you who will say they look new on the outside,
you heard that the PO had changed them, you once had a set last 16 years,
etc... When did you last check the fuel lines? We all sit here and read
about buses burning, but did you really look? Or just plan to do it later?
The fact is, very few of us are not guilty of sacrificing some aspect of
safety, both for ourselves and others in order to keep driving our buses. I
personally would not have done what Brian did, but in the past I have done
things like it and I bet a lot of you have, too. When I see friends of mine
doing things like this I rag on them to fix them, or help them fix them, but
all of this posturing serves no one. The VTO crowd had his back on the trip
home. They had the bus surrounded, had parts, tools and knowledge and looked
out for their own. Just as we all should be doing.

If the intent of some of you is to turn split bus ownership into an elitist
high dollar pursuit, you need only look at Corvette clubs to see how it will
end. A more undesirable group of people to be around I can't imagine. I took
my car to exactly one show. If it rained, half of those snobs would drown.
At the VW shows I have been to I've camped and shared stories with lawyers,
doctors, professionals of all stripes, members of the trades, mechanics,
retired folks, school kids, teachers, notorious bus traders, as well as some
of the dregs of humanity and enjoy every minute of it. It is this collection
of devoted people that makes the bus special, not the bus. When any of you
get to thinking that you are the important part of the hobby, and another
part needs to be weeded out, you have just removed yourself from the heart
and soul of the hobby. Get over it and stop feeling so self important. Your
mommy used to have to clean your poopy diapers too.
