Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tent

&gt; Or another possibility for my B42 .......did I get the early '68 tent with
&gt; the floor...... By March of '67, the interior handles on the interior
&gt; Westfalia cabinets started with the '68 style going into the new model
year.

My '67 Westy was built in May and it had the aluminum runners above the
cargo doors.
