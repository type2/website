&lt;&lt; Hey guys and gals,
 
 It's been so long since I've driven a VW with a stock speedo that I forgot 
which light is
 which on it. Now before you say the red light is this and the green light is 
this, my
 speedo is so old that the lights are faded and I don't know which one is 
which. I went out
 driving today and the light on the left came on, but I don't know which one 
is which :-)
  &gt;&gt;
Turn key to on, both dash lights on?   Now go unplug the wire from the oil 
pressure  switch and make sure it does not ground anywhere.  which light is 
off- that's the oil light.  Turn the key off and Go plug the oil pressure 
switch wire back on.  You can put and O or a G on the speedo in liquid paper 
if that helps.
