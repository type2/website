Hey Bill, and List Buddies,
Sorry, about not responding on friday, I was out of the office all
afternoon, and didn't pick up your e-mail until late friday night. I
just recently figured out how to access my office e-mail from my laptop
at home.
Hope the inlaws were impressed with your treasure.
I got mine running saturday for the first time since I took the engine
out. Here's a good story for you...engine turns over slow, real slow,
changed out the starter, still slow, changed the ignition switch, still
slow, put the battery charger on overnight, still slow,
started checking wiring, changed ground straps, bought new battery
cables, all to no avail.
the culprit.....bad battery charger!! When I thought the battery was up,
it wasn't. Imagine me thinking...damn charger was on all night and
engine barely turns...lesson here, never overlook the obvious.
Still need to set the dwell on the points, re-set the valves, run for a
few hours and check for leaks, problems etc...but it looks good so far.
Today I need to get the title and license and insurance set up and
tonight I can pick my son up when he gets home from his class trip to
D.C.. He's never ridden in the bus and
he'll be really glad to see it on the road.
Maybe we can get together the weekend after Easter.
-John
