Subject: [VB] Vintage Mirror Bracket?

While visiting the coastal area a few weeks back,
I came across a bus with an additional bracket 
for the side mirror.  It attaches to the bottom
bolt of the upper hinge AND where the mirror
attaches to the regular arm.  It looked like
something made to support a heavy mirror.  Even
if it didn't, it looked like a nice vintage
item to me.  This bus only had one on the right
side.  Does anyone have any info on such an item?
