&lt;&lt; I am in need of some of the great list knowledge. My 60 crew cab has a 
weird thing going on in the brakes. It pulls to the right when you first step 
on the brakes. It stops pulling very quickly, even though you still have the 
brakes on. If I step on the brakes again right away it does not pull. If I 
wait about 5 minutes the first time I step on the brakes it pulls again. I 
thought I was dripping a small amount of brake fluid and that was causing
 the pull. I have seen no noticeable drop in fluid. Also after adjusting the 
brakes and the pedal being nice and high, it will drop to about half way down 
within about a 2 week span. It is not spongy just low. Anyone have any ideas?
 Thanks in advance,

1,   how old are your brake hoses.   I had bad brake hoses cause intermittant 
pulling

2, the little springs that keep the adjustment stars from turning -- if they 
break off the stars can disadjust

3.  I put new shoes on my 65 a few months ago.  I have the impression that 
they wear more quickly, the pedal goes down, I am adjusting them every tune 
up now, and they really need them!!!!  maybe the material changed
