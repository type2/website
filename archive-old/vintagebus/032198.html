Thom, you were in the fire service? I've always heard a rumour that they
train those folks that when a VW is burning, just keep the surrounding area
clear. Supposedly because the Magnesium core is not something you want to
spray water on. Any truth to that?

Here's a local legend story that is true...one of our SV2s guys was
cruising home in his 68 single cab. Caught fire and pulled over. Didn't
have the extinguisher so he was pretty bummed. This guy pulls over behind
him, pulls out a can of beer (Bud Light I believe), shakes it up, walks up
to the fire and opens it up. The resulting foam put out the fire! I knew
there had to be a good use for Bud Light! :) Now, if we could only figure
out why he was in a 68 single cab... :)
