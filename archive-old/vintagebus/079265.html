O-tay
We made it back after some excitement this afternoon but I get ahead of
myself.  Maybe best to start at the (fuzzy) beginning.

Friday morning I got out of work a little after 6.  Made it home and
asked the most lovely Crazy Auntie Sherry to let me sleep until 9.  She
let me sleep in until almost 10 after1  I'm a lucky lucky guy I tell
you.  She brought me coffee and told me to get my sleepy butt outta
bed.  So I did, threw some clothes in a bag, looked for some things I
hadn;t seen since High Country, failed at that, finished up loading the
Award Winning Burrito Express (AWBE), and with a mighty roar and a big
grin off we went to the Kitty Store (Food Lion) for last minute impulse
buying spree.  Grocery shopping is much fun when you haven;t had hardly
any sleep for a few days. We had lots of Vienna sausages but no one
seemed to want any when they came to visit.  We managed to get some
things we did need and so off we went up the hill to rendezvous with Doc
Ric in Roan Mt.

As we climbed ever higher I noticed AWBE was running a bit hotter than
usual and was down on power and didn;t like hot starting that much and
made a mental note to check the points gap when we got somewhere.  A
stop in Boone at the scottish place (Note to self - don;t ask for Haggis
at McDonalds again because it adds too much time at the drive through). 
Chuffle on to Roan Mt to meet Doc Ric.

Arrive at Rics with 5 minutes to spare, hang out at the hospital, meet a
dog that'd make a decent snack for my cat Kizzy then off we went for the
next leg of the trip.  A stop at Subway for Teddie then follow Ric along
a wonderful winding back road into Erwin.  Crazy Auntie Sherry said she
knew the way from the dollar store so we were treated to a scenic tour
of lovely Erwin until Ric regained the lead and then we were at the
campground in no time flat.

LD the campground guy pounced before we even got 25 feet into the
campground so we registered, paid, and them went and commandeered the
group camp site up the hill.  Set up the awning, unload the necessities,
wander around a bit, then it was nappy time for a _very_ tired Mad Uncle
Dave.

When I awoke after an unknown time I grumped out of the bus and found we
had Campmates, which was cool.  I wandered around remaking acquaintances
and friendships and having all kinds of campout fun, or so I am told.  I
still hadn;t had much sleep so I don;t remember that much about Friday,
except for dinner (MMmmmm), stopping by Mark Dearing's and eating
grilled pineapple, and looking for a Frank Zappa CD (Just another band
from LA) for Eddie because it has &quot;Eddie are you kidding&quot; on it and I
needed for him to hear it so he'd understand what it was I was singing
at him at random times.  Didn;t find it and at some point I discovered
we had more campmates and I believe I finally went to sleep sometime.

Saturday dawned, mostly because I didn;t have any say in that matter. 
Got up went outside, tripped over something or other, went down the hill
to the restroom,, declined to do communal burrito breakfast and cooked
breakfast burritos for my lovely bride.  They sure were good.  After the
correct amount of visiting and procrastination, I grabbed a tube and
floated down the river in grand style.  

The river was not as high as last year so I fetched up on a few rocks
and got stuck a few times.  I watched the Farfromfloatin go by and hoped
they left my shoes at the pickup spot. They didn;t.  I waited awhile
then started walking back, rolling the tube along and enjoyed the day as
much as I could whilst my tender little feet contacted the road.  I got
about 1/3 of the way there when along came the Farfromfloatin and my
shoes.  

I thought very briefly about getting my shoes and walking the rest of
the way but came to my senses and rode instead.  Back at the site I
volunteered to be the skipper for a while and made several runs picking
up happy tubing campers at the pick up spot and driving them back,
having a great time applying my vast knowledge of the international and
inland navigation rules for the prevention of collision at sea (blow the
horn at the right time).  Young Master Cates came along for one of the
runs, looking at me like I was quite mad and, finally deciding that I
am, left it at that and enjoyed the ride, except when the horn was
blowing.  We got followed by the channel 5 news folks and they
interviewed Mike D'Angelo at the campsite.  It might have rained some
and I think I took a nap.

Wander aimlessly, meet the newest addition to the Lasher family, cook
diner for the lovely Crazy Auntie Sherry.  Hot dogs I think it was. 
Mike came up and asked if I'd officiate at the case burning so I left
the dishes and built the fire.  The fire got going good and the case lit
about 30 minutes into Finding Nemo, obliterating the video portion, much
to the dismay of the people who were trying to watch.  good burn, 2
cases, an upright and a type 3 case.  They burned a real long time too. 
My apologies to all the moviegoers who missed about 25% of the movie
because I build great case fires.  Next year we'll do it further away.

After Finding Nemo came to it's inevitable end, Deliverance came on. 
Great movie, hadn;t seen it in a long time.  Then it was off to bed
time.

Oh yeah, it rained some too as I recall.

Sunday dawned bright and cheery so we had breakfast burritos again, and
grilled blueberry muffins too!  Let the campmates use the stove, because
it's there.  Pack up, wait for some things to dry, pack them too.  Help
Doc Ric rejet his carb. His PICT 30 had a 120 main and he was
complaining that it got hot at WOT.  Jason Lasher came to the rescue
with a box of assorted jets and we settled on a 127 main.  It's much
easier to remove the carb when you rejet it.  Ric got all packed, we got
all packed and it was time to go.

Trouble is, I couldn;t find the keys.  Many many thanks to all the good
people who helped us look for the keys.  Eddie called AAA for their
help.  Our campmates looked. Ric looked.  Everyone lined up to try their
keys to see if they'd work.  We unpacked the bus, all the stuff, took
the bus apart.  No keys.  It's not like me to put keys anywhere but in
my pocket, hung up in the house, or in 1 of my usual stash places in the
bus.  I felt 1 more times in one of the usual spots and felt something
move with my pinky finger. There were the keys.  With a huge sigh of
relief, I watch the AAA guy drive by, then we repacked the bus and off
we go.

AWBE started right up, settled into her usual grumpy idle much quicker
because Friday evening I reset the points, from .008 to .016.  I didn;t
think I had me dwell meter, but I did, as I discovered during the Great
Key Search.

Follow Ric to the nearby food place, buy a big A&amp;W root beer for each of
us and off we went.   Back through Erwin, retracing our drive in without
the scenic tour part.  On the back rooads, AWBE chuffled happily,
running cooler and pulling hills in 4th instead of demanding 3rd gear so
I chalk the points reset as a success.  Stop at Rics, he was beginning
to have clutch troubled but told us Babacia was running much cooler with
her shiny new jet. Again, a big THANKS to Jason for the jet.

On our own, stop in the Mellow Mushroom in Blowing Rock to pick up our
call-in and a couple big travel mugs, 1 for me 1 for Mel because he's
stopping by tonight to pick up a kitten for his daughter and just
because Mel is just too cool and needs a big cup with aliens and flying
saucers on it.  BTW, the mushroom guy's name is Mel too.

Chuffle the rest of the way down the hill, letting the people in a hurry
pass us and with a stop at the store for milk, pull in the driveway,
finishing a most phenomenal camping weekend.

I'd like to thank the Tennessee Mechanized for putting on such a great
campout,  I know how much work that is. The shirts are cool too.  I
would also like to thank all the folks who helped us when I couldn't
find the keys.  And mostly, I would like to thank everyone (with 1
exception that may become a legend) for coming and helping make Buses on
the River my favorite campout of the year.
