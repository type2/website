Rex Rodgers wondered.....

&lt;&lt;  Also, I'm more than positive I will have a hard time 
finding a bus  transaxle for it. &gt;&gt;

You shouldn't- even in an area that seems devoid of
early Type2 stuff.  You'd be surprised what pops up
once you start looking.  I have several complete redux
set ups for both the early and later styles in my core
stash.  I also have various new and used bits and pieces
for them in the 'extra parts' bins out in the shop.

&lt;&lt;But to get it home, I'll probably have to put one in.&gt;&gt;

Probably- at least the axle overtubes, redux assy. and 
axles with a diff in a 'dummy' trans case.  That way it
would be semi-permanent and you could tow it to your
heart's content or roll it around while you restore it. 
(which can take forever- or so it $eem$!)

&lt;&lt;What problems would I have putting a bug transaxle 
rear-end in it. I've searched the archives &amp; found  that I'll 
have to switch the R&amp;P so I don't end up with 4 reverses. 
After  that, I'm unclear if the rear end is going to be the 
proper width.&gt;&gt;

Both the Splitty Bus and Beetle shared the same style
of transaxle housing so its a fairly easy swap.  You will
have to pull the diff out and install it on the other side of
the pinion as you stated.  You will also need to remove
the large diff support bearings and swap the shims from
side to side as well.  Those are what centers the diff in
relationship to the pinion head and if you simply flop the
diff over you can either cause the pinion backlash to be
too tight or too loose.  No big deal there either- those
bearings will come off either with a large puller or if you
are careful you can knock them off the diff section with
a hammer.  Oh yeah, you will need to use the Bus nose
cone and shift selector rod to line up with the coupler
and shaft from the shift lever.  The Beetle nose cone's
set up is too high and the angle of the dangle for the 
selector rod is incorrect. 

As far as the proper width goes you will need to use a
redux axle set up with brakes from a Bus or (oh no!  here
we go again!) fabricate a straight Beetle type axle w/o the
redux assy. and use Type 3 backing plates and drums.
If you plan on keeping it stock (and I *recommend* that you
do) then go for the orginal style reduction gear box set up
and do not consider the Type 1 straight axle way.

&lt;&lt;I may be getting confused with putting an  IRS rear end in.
 I also have access to a few '68-'71 vans as well. Would using 
one of those  tranny's be better, or would it work at all?&gt;&gt;

You might be....
The later Baywindow post-'68s use a completely different
style of transaxle than the earlier Split windows.  My advice
is to stick to stock with some minor modifications to upgrade
it to a more modern useage requirement.  Much, much easier
than trying to shoehorn a later 002 transaxle into that Split
and properly set up with different factory gearing than it came
with orginally the redux set up will give excellent service and
driveability.  Or even easier than trying the dreaded Beetle trans 
and no redux box set up. 
 
 &lt;&lt;p.s. The reason why I'm asking is that bugs are 
EVERYWHERE around here.&gt;&gt;

Thats why probably over 2/3rds of the early Type 2 redux
transaxles that I do are actually converted Beetle boxes.
For the most part they are identical but do have a different
3rd and 4th gear ratio.  You want the Type 2's ratios as
with a late Bug 3.875 ring and pinion (vs. the 4.375 or 4.125 
that your Split has) and the post-'64 redux box ratios you
can cruise down the highway at 3200 +/- rpm at 65mph
all day long.  Once you've been in one of those converted
Type 2s you'll never want to got back to the old 'stock'
ratio'd gearboxes- its as different as night and day.  Have
you been in an Split-window and actually passed someone
on the highway without worrying about punching a rod 
through the case??  You can with these gearboxes.  

I can help with the gearbox end of your project and I am
sure that there has to be someone down Texas way that
can help as well.  

Good luck and I'd make a plan on how much money and
time you think you'll spend on this project- Then triple it!
You might just barely come in on schedule and budget
that way!
