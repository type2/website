&gt; PS: Solvang is 40 minutes north from Santa Barbara. It is a quaint
little
&gt; Danish Town  I guess you could say nostalgic.

I guess you can say &quot;tourist trap&quot;!  The decor is Danish, but it's
about as genuine as Hollywood.  It's fun for a quick visit, but I
don't think I'd want to stay there.  Prices for everything are
sky-high, even when compared to the normally inflated Central Coast
scale.

I used to belong to a motorcycle club that often took rides to
Solvang.  The wives seemed to like buying ceramic nick-nacks, but
there wasn't much else there.  When I became tourmaster I got back at
them by having the club take a ride to Taft! (scenic oil fields!)
