&quot;I think its quite silly that people are running around saying they NEED
all this original glass to get their busses back on the road&quot;


Hey, If your game is putting it back together as close as the way it came from
the factory so-be-it. Why would it matter? That's what vintage is all about. If
you want to tint all your windows and slam it to the ground install a type 4
motor I don't care, I'll just crave the stuff you removed, governor and all.
Mine is to make them as safe and comfortable as can be sacrificing the minimum
amount of its originality (and using only enough roofing tar to keep out the
rain) I'm not driving on bias plys and I don't sit on horse hair but I like  my
original glass delaminated and all, and I'm not parting with any of it.  If this
was just about transportation I'd opt for a Japanese built leather clad sport
ute. (don't say anything Jack)
