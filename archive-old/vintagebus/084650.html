Subject: RE: FS: '67 Westfalia Campmobile Type 2 VW in Vermont

&gt;From: Tom Good &lt;SoloHobbit_at_ecologicarchitecture_dot_com

&gt;To anyone who has expressed an interest in buying this bus: 

&gt;I told a buyer from SC,
 If you want to send me a check, it's yours (ie sold) once your check clears.&gt;
&gt;Which is to say, it belongs to whomever makes payment first.

That's weird.  In South Carolina that means the bus is sold, period.

&gt;
&gt;The buyer from SC has indicated he has put a check in the mail to my 
&gt;address.

&gt;A buyer from QC has also indicated that he is sending me a check 
&gt;overnight.&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I will deposit which ever check I receive first, and will return any other 
&gt;checks I receive if the first check clears, unless someone wires or shows 
&gt;up with cash first. 

I can tell you exactly what the buyer in SC thinks of that.  That is putting 
people through a lot of unnecessary horseshit (i.e., putting in for leave, 
borrowing a trailer, aranging lodgings with relatives in Pennsylvania, 
ect.)for reasons I cannot fathom.  In other words, there is no buyer in SC 
anymore.
If in your planned travels you happen to find yourself down my way, feel 
free to drop by, I'd love to have a little chat.

JT in SC
