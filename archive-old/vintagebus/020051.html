thom has a wiring diagram for a '55-'57 bus on his site but it's euro spec.  seems to me it oughta be pretty much the same except for the semaphores.  maybe used in conjunction with '58 to whatever you'd cover all the bases?  by the way, i happen to know that there is wiring diagram in that spare room of yours.  furthermore it is purported to be a '55-'57 non-euro spec bus wiring diagram.  it is in color and framed for its protection (no greasy fingerprints).  unfortunately there is no key but hey, wires don't care do they.  haha.
