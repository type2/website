, but what should I do to get the old
&gt; broken ones of without ruining my Powdercoat job. Also--any tips on
getting
&gt; the rivets on? Do I need a special tool. Help!!!

Drill the rivets out. After this happened to me, I quit trying to use the
stock type rivets. I now use stainless steel pop rivets. They can be set
without damaging the finish and the hole in the middle makes them easy to
drill out. I'm no vintage nazi. I also use pop rivets for the vent wing
latches. They break often there's just no sense in beating up the frames
every time one has to be replaced.
