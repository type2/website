Hey everybody:

Thanks to everyone who gave me advise on forcing the vent glass into the 
frames with the new WCM seals.

Someone mentioned using inner tube pieces instead. That was the solution 
that worked.

I bought a new $3.00 bicycle inner tube, cut it in two and then sliced it 
open. I cleaned out the powdery stuff inside, coated the inside of the frame 
and the edge of the glass with 3M weatherstrip adhesive and shoved 
everything together. A few light taps with a rubber hammer also helped.

The next day when the glue was dry, I trimmed away the extra rubber and it 
looked as good as new. No leaks so far.
