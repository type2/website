My recommendation would be to go with powdercoating of the bumpers for
durability.  And do the big VW symbol on the nose along with them.  Cost
is not unreasonable unless you're on a really tight budget.  Find a
reputable local shop that does this type of work.  They'll have a stock
lineup of colors available.  Whatever the name, pick near to the whitest
shade available and you should do fine in a reasonable approximation of
Silver-White.  That's what I did and I think the contrast with my Pearl
White body color looks great.

Or you can just spray paint them Pearl White if that is your desire,
there's plenty of examples of people painting their bumpers to match the
body colors.  It's all a matter of taste...

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm &quot;almost&quot; to the point where I'll be dipping, neutralizing, and painting
&gt; my bumpers for my '66 Westy.  I don't know why I'm even asking this, because
&gt; the color I've gone and painted her is not a definable one (at least not
&gt; stock), but I guess it is your opinions that count:  If I paint my bumpers
&gt; the same white as the above the beltline parts (a close approximation of
&gt; Pearl White), will it look stupid?  Should I try to find a match to this
&gt; mysterious Silver-White for the bumpers and wheels?  Or should I just spray
&gt; on that white POR-15?  (I have a feeling that that would look even more
&gt; stupider...)
