Subject: Mounting your center section

Quick question, folks...

I installed a rebuilt transmission  in my 66 DD Panel, only to find that it
would not shift after it was in.  A quick check of the archive and a minor
racking of brains, lead me to believe that I had the gear selection forks
improperly positioned and the hockey stick was stuck.  Soooo...I yanked the
whole thing out again, guessed that all the forks should be lined up with
each other so that the tranny was in neutral, set them that way, and
reinstalled the nose cone and hockey stick.  I put the transmission back in,
but now the hockey stick does not seem to want to reach the shift coupling,
no matter how much I cuss and stomp around.  What is the trick to this
install?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom
