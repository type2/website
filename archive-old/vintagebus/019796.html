&gt;Thom has a
&gt;picture of this &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; moron on his website.

I did a keyword search for &quot;a**hole&quot; and didn't see it.  In fact, rather surprisingly, there are NO matches to &quot;a**hole&quot; in the entire gallery.  How can that be?

&gt;I think it was his head though!!!!!!

&quot;Dude, hear that?&quot; [hollow knocking]  &quot;That's my head!!&quot;

&gt;His bus also has no side windows.....and safaris kicked ALL the way 
&gt;open......he drove the entire way to Jerome like that!

Maybe something critical blew out of his ear then, forced out by air pressure up the schnozz.

You know, I'm gettin' all verklempft here, thinking about back when I was oblivious enough to do sh*t like that (the driving part).  You fellas talk amongst yourselves 
for a while.  I'm gonna go pound my head against a cement wall, see if I can recapture the old feeling....
