I think the new bus could be done 2 ways.

Carry the styling crease from the sides onto the hood into a V like the
splits.  Also replace the headlights with round NB style lights.

Or

Bump out the nose like a Bay, and have round headlights.

I think the bus is a cool thing even if it is left like it is.  It will be
differennt from most other minivans, which was always VWs forte.

Will it be as cool as my double cab or westy?  Probably not.  WOuld I buy an
(affordable) one for a daily driver?  You Bet!!
