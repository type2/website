Great day!   No oil light .  Drove the bus all day today and ran great. 
Changed the fluid in the reduction gear boxes and also the tran. Look
forward to seeing everyone at Bob Baker.  My 4 year old has already
claimed my 65 camper as his own. Oh well there is this other 66 camper I
will be going  to look at tomorrow.  The guy wants 500 bucks it looks
straight and he has the engine out with some machine work done.  Has
anybody seen this bus its in Encinitas CA.  Bus people are the best
people......
