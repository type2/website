&gt;&gt;why would an oil pressure gauge be better to start out with?
&gt;If one can not afford to get both oil pressure and temp gauges the
&gt;pressure gauge shows more of what is happening in the engine.  

I'd agree - consider that Volkswagen thought a (admittedly rudimentary)
pressure indication was the best choice for an engine indicator.

&gt;In electronics almost anything is possible!  It just depends on how much
&gt;you want to spend!

As far as the inverters go, I have seen DC-DC converters in several
electronics catalogs.  The ones I think would be useful for a Bus
have a 5v input, 12v output, at anything from 1 to 40 watts or so
(0.083 A to 3.3 A).  If you can find a suitable one in an electronic
surplus catalog, they are generally cheap, like $5-$15 or so.  New ones
are available but have silly prices, from $60 to $100 or more.

I have thought about installing a small 6 volt sealed lead-acid
battery (gel cell) in series with the vehicle power to power 12v
accessories.  Ideally, the setup would include a relay and charge
itself somehow when not needed.  Otherwise, you'd have to keep
taking the battery out to charge it, or have two batteries that
you could switch between.

A Bus-owning friend who is an amateur radio operator just keeps
a huge marine deep-cycle 12-volt battery in the back of his Bus,
just inside the cargo doors, and runs all his 12v stuff from that.
He puts it on a 110v charger whenever he's at home.

&gt;&gt;one more question about gauges, what about digital vs. analog?
&gt;We prefer analog.

Besides the good reason that Eric&amp;Barb gave (trend indication),
you can also get that kewl racing look by rotating the gauge
in the mounting so that the needle points straight up when all
is well.  That way you just have to glance at the gauges for
any needles that are not standing straight up.  :)
