That's an interesting question. And if the answer is
yes, then couldn't you make a double-door middle seat
using a regular 1/3 2/3 middle seat and a front seat,
with some clever cutting and welding?

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has ever repaired the

&gt; front seats used from
&gt; 63-67 have the same backrest spring assemblies as
&gt; the 1/3 2/3 full-length
&gt; middle seats?  So could I just unclamp the springs
&gt; from the frame and clamp
&gt; them onto my middle seat frames to fix them?  This
&gt; is the backrests only...
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know,
