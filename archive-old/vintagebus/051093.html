Have you ever stood with you weight on an aluminum can?  It will support a lot
of weight until you &quot;touch&quot; deform the sides of the cylinder then Collapse!  Put
something back to build the &quot;can? back up, belly pans, walk through sections if
you want to keep the walk through or full separator.  Or twin 6 in. I beams top
and bottom.
Or do not drive it and make it a trailer Queen!

&gt; I have a'66 Kombi that was retro'ed with a '63 23 window rag top.  The guy I
&gt; bought it from put in cargo doors on the drivers side to turn it into a jump
&gt; through, and it had already beed converted to a bucket seat walk through, by
&gt; cutting out the center and bending down the panel that runs along behind the
&gt; bench seat.
