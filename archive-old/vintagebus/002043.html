What is the radius to level or at least clear ground? With
the blackberry overgrowth, can a person make their way to
the SC?

&gt; Here's the scenario:
&gt;
&gt; The single cab  is up on the bed of a flatbed truck, which
is on top of
&gt; who-knows-what.  It's about 10 feet in the air.
&gt;
&gt; There are large piles of stuff, very heavy stuff, in front
of it.
&gt; three sides are completely overgrown with blackberries.  I
know the terrain
&gt; underneath is not level, and it's impossible to discern
&gt; exactly what the topology is due to the overgrowth of
blackberries.
&gt;
&gt; Truck has a front beam, but no trans.  no front wheels
&gt;
&gt; If the truck *was* sucessfully lowered to the ground,
there are a lot
&gt; of misc cars that need to be moved out of the way to get a
&gt; truck in and out to load up the single cab.  Thesecould
probably be pushed/pulled
&gt; out of the way.
&gt;
&gt; It's transaxle and engine (still bolted together!) are on
top of some
&gt; junk some 40 feet away.  I'd wanna get those down too.
&gt;
&gt; John Hicks can supply some more insight.
