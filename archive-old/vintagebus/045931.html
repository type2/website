The set screws should be on either side of the bolt tab.
The 180 degree ones are later (61-64 I think).
The inner buckets should be black on the backs and silver on the inside.

&lt;&lt; Hi all those with parts books...


I was disassembling the headlight buckets on my 59 double cab so I can send

the beauty rings in to get re-chromed and I noticed that they are different.

One has a part number 221 941 038B and one has 221 941 037A.  The 038B

bucket is white and the 037A is silver.  The other thing is that one of the

beauty rings has the small hold down screw holes close to the bolt tab and

the other has the small screw holes on the opposite sides of the ring from

one another (one close to the tab and one farther away).


So, whats what???


Thanks
