Subject: Re: [VB] junkyard rules or respect your fellow man

Was that the point?

I think Paul was pointing out the needless destruction of parts the
previous customer didn't need, which were damaged when the hamfisted
customer just ripped everything out of the way to get at the part he
needed.  Throwing stuff on the ground, leaving doors and windows open to
admit the elements, stepping on stuff others threw on the ground, etc.

I suggest carefully removing what you need, and trying to preserve the rest
for the next guy.

&gt;Yup.  Now that parting buses is Big Business, any bus I've seen in a
&gt;junkyard for the past
&gt;couple years is just stripped.  Like a cow in the Amazon river -
&gt;skeletonized in a matter of minutes...
