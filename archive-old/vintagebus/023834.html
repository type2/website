mid `55 to `58  Deluxe Hardtops are actually somewhat rare compared to sunroof
models.  Though the sunroof deluxe is far more in demand.  So, even though they
are fairly rare, I would say they are still worth far, far less then its 23 window
sunroof counterpart.

... I guess just because something is rare does not make it valuble....could I
interest anyone in an &quot;Auto stick&quot; Beetle for instance??  Quite rare compared to a
regular Beetle!!  :-)

Take care, tds
