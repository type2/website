&lt;&lt; The owner said that 1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case

transmissions, sort of an in-between thing.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
It looks to us like he might be right!  The APR58 Bus parts manual we have 
shows no first gear syncro!  Just for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  Plus first is 
straight cut instead of the heli cut on the other three forward gears.
