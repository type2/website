Subject: Re: [VB] Welding trouble

My tip is &quot;frying bacon&quot;.  If the welder does not sound like you are
frying 
bacon when you are welding a bead then it is not set right.
-------------------- Clip ------------------
Absolutely Right!
After becoming nearly blind (retina contracted in bright light) that
frying bacon sound enabled me to weld with my eyes closed. I was welding
16/18 gage square tubing for wrought iron fences with a Miller wire feed
and all in all I still made pretty good welds.
That was 14 years ago and my sight has 80% returned although really
bright headlights oncoming at night tend to excite my eyes and I have to
refocus after they pass.
