&gt;How do you all suggest trying to free this engine up without damaging
&gt;rings, etc?

I have heard, but have never personally verified, that ATF works well
in this application.

It might work better to stand the engine on one head and put your oil
of choice in the top two cylinders, let it stand, then flip it over
and do the same thing.  Otherwise, if the engine is still flat, you'll
need to almost completely fill the cylinder with oil to reach all the
way around the rings.  But it does result in a lot of flipping over
if the first soak doesn't work.

Getting creative, what would happen if you took off the heads to see
where the pistons are, then heated the cylinders just outside where
the rings are with a torch?  This might unstick it, or it might be a
really good way to warp the cylinders.  I don't know.
