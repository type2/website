Hello Volks!

I have Wolfgang safaris in mine. They leak like a sieve, between the
glass and the seal. I keep duct tape over all the edges during the
winter months. It matches the grey primer on my bus... I've gone thru
several RMMW latches, they seem to break all the time... Still, when
drought season gets here, and I can drive around with the safaris open
all the time (cracked at highway speeds, full open at campgrounds), the
chicks really do notice!
