Well I read the Idiot hand book last night and it says if the holes in
the flywheel and the crankshaft end are rounded out you have to take em
both to a machine shop and get them redrilled. Well I guess if you open a
can of worms that's what you get.

Now I am going to tear down the engine and take the crankshaft out. But I
am not a real big fan of getting the end holes redrilled. I figure if I
got it out, Replace it with a new one....But will it effect the engine
performance because a new one will not have the same wear pattern as the
old.
