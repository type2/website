Howdy, Volks!

Michele and I had way too much fun this weekend.  The '66 Westy we just got
with the house paint is now going to become &quot;Gene's First Experience with a
Real Live Spray Gun&quot;.  Good luck wishes are welcome.  Follow the following
to see just how much fun we're having (and are doomed to have much more of.)
Keep in mind that this is only to be a decent-looking, solidly functioning
camper bus, so we are not going to &quot;go off&quot; or &quot;stress out&quot; about the
imperfections.  (Oh, there are a few here and there...)

We have agreed that the above the beltline will be the &quot;proper&quot; white, and
that the below will be pretty much the same shade of blue/green you see in
the &quot;before&quot; pics.  There are many indications that this was once a hippie
bus....or at least a &quot;crazed person with no appreciation for subtlety
whatsoever&quot; bus.  Colors in weird places...not matching like places.....this
was a ragtag bus at one time.  I'd love to get a picture of it in 1971 or
whenever it looked like what it must have!  There was a smiley sun with
flames on the driver's side rear upper panel...it slowly took shape as I
sanded.....pretty groovy!

I have more fun things to express, and questions galore, but my fingers
hurt....

Later!

Gene
