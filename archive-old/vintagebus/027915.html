Bob:

Yes, it actually is &quot;dire need.&quot;  Without going into any personal details that would be boring to the list, he is in a bind and needs to come up with a source as quickly as he can.  I know it sounds strange, but this has nothing to do with trying to get a trailer ready for a show, meet or trip.

I'll just leave it at that.  As always, any help in locating the parts would be truly appreciated by him.  Thanks.

Robert
