Subject: Re: [VB] CHT, Oil temp, fan speed, and jetting ramblings

Hi Adrian,

If it gets close to pinging and heads are hot then before re-jetting
I'd try retarding the timing a bit. I'm no jetting expert but I have
read somewhere that main jet size goes with size of carb throat, so
with a 34 PICT , 145 main is about the biggest you want to go.
This is one such place.

As far as oil temps go I do not think that 25 minutes is enough to
fully warm up the oil and excite the VDO sensor. However if the oil in
such an engine was staying that low I'd be totally jealous. What what
the outside air temperature during your ride ?
/enjoy\
