&gt;I have just spent a frustrating 2.5 hours trying to reinstall the
&gt;glass in ONE of my vent wing windows.  I bought new rubber gasket
&gt;material from Wolfsburg West, which seems very thick, and I just
&gt;cannot make it all come together at once.  I can't even the the glass
&gt;to seat on the forward edge of the frame.

I guess I'm going to have to write this up and keep it on file.
I used the material from WCM, which seemed to be just right.
You need two small c-clamps or strong spring clamps. Now remember, Front is
Front.
Starting about 2 inches down from the top on the REAR edge of the glass,
fold the rubber over the glass
and clamp it gently but firmly. Stretch the rubber over the top, front edge,
bottom and around to the rear edge
again. It should be stretched enough to reduce it's thickness and allow it
to press firmly into the frame.
After the glass/rubber is fully seated into the frame all the way around,
release the clamps and let it sit
for about 30 minutes. Do a ROUGH trim of the rubber, leaving about 1/4 in.
all the way around. Let it sit
at least overnight to let the rubber draw back fully before the final trim.
I would recommend a day or two if
time allows. After that, trim the rubber flush with the frame and reinstall
the unit in the window assembly.

HTH.
