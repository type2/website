Straight Swing Axle Conversion 

. Pre 1967 bus owners can now lower the rear of their
bus 3 1/2î or more, removing the low geared reduction
boxes and obtaining enine saving highway gearing. The
basic bolt-on kit comes with spring plates, axle
tubes, gaskets and complete instructions. Other
components needed are 1968 bug or any swing axle type
3, long axles and brake assemblies. You can use your
existing bus tranaxle; however, you will need to flop
your ring gear over. Another way is to use an entire
trans out of a bug or type 3. Sold on an exchange
basis for the spring plates. This kit lowers the back
at least 3 1/2î, there is no way to raise this kit
from there. If 3 1/2î is to low see the IRS kit.
