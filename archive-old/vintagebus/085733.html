Subject: generator problem

Hi Guys,
Here is an adventure. Does anyone have any ideas what they would recommend? My 38 amp generator appears to have malfunctioned. I took a long drive on the freeway for a few hours. I looked down and saw the red light on on the dash. I didn't smell anything so I just pulled off the freeway exit, came to a full stop, ran back to the engine to take a look-see. Nothing was out of the ordinary. The fan belt was fine. The engine temp was normal. The dip stick wasn't too hot to hold. All the wires appeared to be connected. I had replaced the voltage regulator a few weeks earlier as I had upgraded the engine to 12 volt. I removed and replaced the brushes. They appeared to be fine. They were almost the length of new brushes. The commutator was shiney. Again all the wires appeared to be solid and good connections. The red light stayed on. So I bought a rebuilt generator. It came in the mail yesterday. But now the generator light went out and appears to be working fine. The light comes on when 
I turn the key to the first notch. I start the engine and the light goes out as it should. I did try a test: disconnect the two wires from the generator. Connect a voltmeter to the generator. They registered zero volts. I haven't reconnected the voltmeter to the generator yet again now that the red light has gone out. If I do, I expect it to read what, 13 or 14 volts? Do you think there is a loose connection inside the generator that has reconnected for a while? Is an intermittent charging generator something that anyone has encountered before? Should I just replace the damn thang now, let it fail, or what? Maybe if I hang with it a little longer, I can learn something more about generators. As long as the battery stays strong I'm not too worried.
Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Dave in Pacific Grove, California
