To hang or not to hang... that is the question!

I saw about two weeks ago, a standard bus tranny inside a bug.  For an
engine, they had a small block V8.
The V8 was just using the standard mounts for the horn + tranny mounts...
the horn did have a little extra reinforcement but the small block was
totally hanging on the tranny.  This pretty red VW bug has been this way for
more then 20 years, and the owner said that he never has had a problem with
a broken tranny mount.

He did say that he does have a problem when the front wheels land, that VW's
in general don't like to do wheelies!  Well, duh!


&gt; ,but my T1 engine has no mount to attach it to hanger !! what can be done
?
