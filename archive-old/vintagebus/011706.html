&gt; 
my limited experience w/ &quot;sigla&quot; vs &quot;sekurit&quot; it that they switched to sekurit (small letter) around 63' or so

like most things vw there are exceptions to every rule and i would bet that vw simply used up their supply of sigla prior to going to sekurit.

i too have found the sigla laminate to be more prone to separating althugh any of the curved glass is esp. prone

NB that &quot;old &quot; i.e. BD's and the like used BIG LETTER &quot;SEKURIT&quot; glass prior to the sigla which precursed small letter sekurit..

ahh trivia, personally if the glass isn't scratched that is accomplishment enough regardless of the stencilling on the glass!
