Subject: mailing list question regarding SPAM

I have a question to the faithful members of the VW community.  I sent an 
email out to the a few of the VW newsgroup lists of which I am a member.  My 
question is this, did I just SPAM you?  Apparently, at least one member 
thinks I did.  I am aware that conducting business via the VW lists is 
against policy.  I've been a member of most of these lists for a couple of 
years now, and have attempted to adhere to this policy to the best of my 
ability.  I am also of the opinion that most listees welcome the occasional 
parts for sale, items for trade, or new products availability announcements 
that are posted.  When The Bus Depot announces that hard-to-find German items 
have, once again, become available, I applaud it.  (Ron, you can thank me 
later for the plug ;o)  Or when new sheet metal becomes available through 
Ronnie at Old Volks Home.  These guys notify people on the list because they 
are part of the &quot;list&quot; family themselves.  A lot of times, special deals are 
offered to list members only.  I know I offer discounts or free shipping to 
list members.  My earlier email was merely an offer to the list members who 
are not on my personal email mailing list.  I have this list specifically so 
I can send items specials, via p-mail, to those who are interested and not 
compromise the integrity of the VW lists.  Unfortunately, my email may have 
been taken in offense.  I was told that I &quot;piss off more people than you 
please by spamming them.&quot;  I was also told that any unsolicited email was 
considered &quot;SPAM&quot;.  Well, I thought that being a member of a newsgroup list 
meant that you welcomed it's unsolicited email.  After-all, every email you 
get via the lists are &quot;unsolicited&quot; aren't they?  At any rate, I wanted to 
pose the question to everyone out there.  If I've offended you or violated 
any newsgroup policy, I apologize.  However, I'm sure the list admin. would 
have let me know.  Let me know what you think.  I don't want to make this 
into another &quot;war of words&quot; on the lists, everyone knows we've had plenty of 
those.  So any comments can be p-mailed to me.
