Subject: Re: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

Whew,
You had me really scared . I thought the whole back was trashed. could have
been worse , though it still sucks.
Over here (Carolinas) AAA wants you to sign a waiver that says they are not
responsible for and damage that might happen. They act like you absolutely
must sign it to get towed.
they may try to stiff you and say that they are not liable because the
vehicle was not &quot;registered and road worthy&quot;
I have been pretty lucky with AAA, although I have had to turn away drunk
truck drivers and hook truck a few times.
good luck,
Bryan
