Subject: Re: [VB] The City of Beatrice strikes again.

&gt;Heh Heh - I knew it was coming.  The city is doing Big Brother sweeps of the
&gt;residential neighborhoods targeting the owners of &quot;junk vehicles.&quot;  I got
&gt;another letter today from them and man, they are getting agressive.  They've
&gt;not only targeted my 67 but they've targeted my brother's bug in the
&gt;backyard.

...snip...

After I got home from the library, I saw a cop car
&gt;drive by the house very slowly so they are looking for the other one I guess
&gt;(which they ain't gonna find it.)
&gt;
&gt;Funny twist to all of this is that Cheif Lang said in the paper that 'stock
&gt;cars and race cars are exempt.'  Guess I need to put numbers and sponsor
&gt;stickers on the side of the bus. :-)


Sorry to get political, but this would never happen with a libertarian
govenment.

Sure hope you're able to prevail over those creeps.  :-)
