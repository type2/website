&gt;[...] She blinks, beeps, and illuminates in all the right places!

Cool!

&gt;I'm thinking of not running one of those el-cheapo in-line filters, 
&gt;although I'll probably use one for the first few thousand miles just
&gt;in case.

I know there have been discussions here lately about that.  I would
say to use a name brand in-line filter like Wix, clamp the hoses,
and not worry about it.  If you're worried about breakage, change
the filter every oil change or once a month or whatever...they're
like $2.  If you get some junk in the tank (or maybe if some of
the sealer comes through the line), having the filter in the line 
moves the likely failure point from the carb [remove, tear down, soak,
reassemble, install, adjust] to the filter [remove clamps, change,
replace clamps].  Again just IMHO.
