Subject: dillon beach report

this past weekend jp and i camped at dillon beach with the split bus club.  we arrived friday evening in heavy wind and pouring rain.  not deterred we drove on into the campground and looked for the buses.  amazingly the new camping trailer, a 1959 apache chief, jp had bought the day before went up easily and quickly despite the weather and darkness.  as jp was going to camp in his flipseat and all i had was my single cab, the chief was going to be my home for the weekend.  i am pleased to report that the old canvas is still water proof!

friday night/saturday morning it poured rain and was super windy; i thought that if i didn't float away i'd probably blow away!  saturday was beautiful though and jp and i made our rounds checking out the buses and talking to volks.  more buses came in the afternoon but even so there were only three commercials representin', my single cab and two highroofs.

fireside (make that three bonfires) chat that evening was great, sean dorman and his buddy had some crazy funny vw stories to share and i went to bed with visions of transmissions crunching in half and flying type 3s in my head.  sunday morning was cloudy but cleared up into another beautiful day.  i was sad that the camping was over but glad that i could drive my truck again after just admiring it over the last few days.

cheers,
