&gt; 
&gt; The best mirrors that I have seen for a pre-67 bus are the ones I got in 
&gt; Germany 2 years ago.
&gt; I believe that they were made for firetrucks (Feuerwagen) and you can see 
&gt; them in the link above.
&gt; BTW Clara has the box that they came in....... a 211 857 513 C.

i have those mirrors on zapper the 66 dormobile which is a european westy camper from the factory
brought over here by private party. 
they are difficult to find. 
any lead on replacement molding around the edges???
