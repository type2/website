Subject: Original round mirrors, have one
To: &quot;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com Vintagebus&quot; &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

With all the talk of NOS/Repo round mirrors, I thought
I would send this along for all...
A couple of weeks ago I was in a local VW Flaps buying
my usual load of parts when the parts guy tells me he
found a original NOS in the box round bus mirror that
has been on a back shelf for many years. HE didn't
even have to ask if I wanted it, oh ya, still in the
original VW box, marked &quot;Made in Germany&quot;. 
Score! $$35
The box is marked as such...

KA/5-220279
2 STUECK
211 857 513
MADE IN GERMANY
