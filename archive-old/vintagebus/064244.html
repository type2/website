Subject: Re: [VB] Rabbit Resevoir???

[...]


&gt; I am not sure what the difference between the 68-71 MC and the 72-79 MC is.
&gt; I had a power brake MC on my 71 westfailure and would sure love to have
&gt; something like that on my 67 SC. Oh yeah, I have power brakes now, it just
&gt; matters on how hard I push the pedal!

The 68-70 master cylinders cannot be used because no one makes a reservoir
with a cap to go on them.
The 68-70 masters have nipple holes that are 100mm center to center.
67 duals, 71-79, rabbits, and early Volvos are 85mm center to center. [Volvo
reservoirs work better, the cap is level. Rabbits are on an angle....]
68 and up buses use an upper and lower reservoir. 68 is one year only. The
connecting pipe between them is metal. All the others are plastic.
