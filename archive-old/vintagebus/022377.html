Got my May issue of Playboy. Man, there's a great picture with 'em spread
wide open.........the safari windows that is ;) (sorry, I live in
politically incorrect west Texas and couldn't resist)

Speaking of which...Have you ever experienced a west Texas dust storm?
We've got one going on right now and it looks like hell on earth outside.
I'm sure Eric &amp; Barb know what I'm talking about as I think they lived down
here at one time. It's a far cry from my previous &quot;oasis&quot; home in Austin.
I'm thinking about dragging some parts outside for a &quot;natural&quot; blasting
treatment!

Met a fellow bus nut a few weeks ago. He's got a '67 standard. I put a link
to some pics on my site. We decided to start a VW club and have been
putting info on VW's around town. If all goes well my Kombi will be rolling
in an annual little local parade. Hope they put us right behind the
lowrider club!!!!

I think I figured out why I've got the electric fuel pump on my engine.
It's a 75 bug case, which I think was fuel injected, and then doesn't have
the mechanical fuel pump....right? I'm just guessing on this one. Is that
right? FYI: the engine has a 34 Pict 3 carb on it now. I can here Thom
mumbling &quot;hoopty&quot; as he reads this! The engine came with the bus and I
gotta get by on it for a little while.

What's the general feeling about having the little clear fuel filter in the
fuel line right before the carb? That's how it is at the moment. Good or
bad football?

Had a couple of listees mention getting a regulator to go after the
electric fuel pump. What exactly should I ask for at my FLAPS?

Still havn't got the engine to fire. I'd like to go ahead and go through
all the procedures I need to to check everything out. I'll go ahead and get
new points, plugs &amp; cables, fuel line, ect. I'm guessing I'll need to check
fuel system and electricity (spark). Any suggestions on what stuff I should
do and tips on how to do it?
