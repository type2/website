hmmm

Ok, my lights that are not working are the lil' bulbs in the headlight
buckets (those i referred to as running lights)  and my license plate light,
and my brake lights.  My headlights and signal lights (front and rear) work
fine and when my head lights are one those little RED rear lights are on as
well, it's just that when you step on the brakes there is no difference.
When I tried to fix my head light switch I broke one of the copper dealies
inside, so I fashoned a similar shaped thing out of copper and just soldered
it on, it seems to work very well.  Also,  there is a wire coming from my
head light switch that has one of those inline fuses in it, then two wires
go off of that - I sort of thought one was for the running lights (lil'
bulbs in my head light bucket) and the other was for the license plate light
hmmm but i wasn't sure.  And the inline fuse burned out - I'm very busy
right now that's why I really don't have the time to play around - I'd kinda
like to narrow it down to one or two issues and fix it over the weekend.
