&lt;&lt; Thanks for your help again.&gt;&gt;
Hi Meridith,

&lt;&lt;Looking at the foward shift linkage I found some movement. Just like my 63 
the SC had no screw visible that holds the two shift rods together. Isnt 
there suppose to be one?&gt;&gt;
Yes, though it should be a square headed bolt and it should have had a safety 
wire throught the head to keep it from both loosening and falling away.  
Which is what probably happened to the bolt, and now the joint has loosened 
causing your shifting problem.

&lt;&lt;On the 63 I had to drill out the old screw and install a new one. I 
replaced the clutch  seal a few years back when I replaced the tranny oil, 
and also the flywheel seal with a new engine. I ASSume the trans is the one 
that came with the truck in 64, I think the bus has around 130,000 miles on 
it, is that alot for a trans.&gt;&gt;
Not if it has been taken care of and had it's oil changes at least every 
30,000 miles.  Original trannies should last at least 250,000 miles.  

 &lt;&lt;As allways thank you for your valuable time and knowledge. &gt;&gt;
Glad we could help.  Eric&amp;Barb
