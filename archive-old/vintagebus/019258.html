Subject: Is my emblem straight?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have an OG-paint emblem which I want to have
chromed, rather than buy a repop, since they are 99%
junk.

I want to ask the pro's here if this is straight, it
has a slight apex in it at the top. The apex is
symmetrical on each side, and looks like it matches
the front of DARTHVW. But there is a junky repop on
there right now so I can't hold it directly on it. The
repop doesn't have this bend in it at the top. Maybe
that tells me something right there?

What do you think?

Go here to see the OG:
