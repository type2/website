&gt;Hello all.  Well I finally broke down and did it.  I bought a Judson
&gt;Supercharger today, just had to have it.  I know they don't do a whole lot
&gt;but I have always wanted one.  Does anyone have any experience with these? 
&gt;Performance secrets?  Bus installation?  Any help is appreciated, 
&gt;otherwise I guess I'll figure it out.  My count only includes one 58 double
&gt;door at present I have been cleaning up as to start bying again.

Did you get all the pieces?
