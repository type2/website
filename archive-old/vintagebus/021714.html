Correct me if I am wrong, but the roof piece was actaully two. I saw this in 
the westy parts manual, then checked in my 67 and could see the seam. Maybe I 
am wrong?

&lt;&lt; Home depot doesn't carry the correct stuff; neither species of wood,
 grain or size.  You need European sized sheets to be able to do the
 roof pieces, as 'merkin 4x8 isn't large enuf.  Also, you gotta give some
 for the cutting and finishing.  RVB can be more specific.
