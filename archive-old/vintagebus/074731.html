Subject: Paint Job

I have looked at about a billion pictures of paint jobs and was undecided
on what I wanted ... UNTIL I SAW THIS !!! This is the paint that I want ..
Problem is .. I don't have a CLUE how they did it or where to start.  I am
thinking it is done with an airbrush ..  Don't know how they got those dark
lines though .. anyway .. I LOVE IT .. Now I just need to figure out how to
do the same to my bus.  appreciate any clues ...
