Most of Bugpacks junk is the same as Empi and the mag whores, cheap Tiawan
garbage packaged in there own packages but made by the same manufacturer,
that is why I always check out parts before I will sell them.

ps. CB's oil filter pumps are made in brazil by Schdeak (spelling), as good
as it get's unless you find an original EMPI, (chris?)

Hi Steve, 
Probably the Bugpack clutch TO arm is giving you the problems!  We looked 
into thier new oil filter/pump and found that it was only good as an ash
tray 
due to sloppy machining!  So it looks like they sell good scrap metal 
advertised as VW parts...  Retorque your axle nuts, and do the same for the 
bolts that mount the RGBs to the swing plates!   Eric&amp;Barb
