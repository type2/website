I know these wheel string are getting old but I still want to add something.

When I bought by 66 standard 9 years ago it had 15&quot; wheels.  What I found
out a few years later is that they were early bug rims ( the smooth kind
without the holes).  I have never bothered to change.  Can any body tell me
the if the dimensions are different than the 15&quot; bus wheel?

Thanks, Harry




&gt;&lt;&lt; What year did the rims change from 15&quot; to 14&quot; &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Andy,
&gt;During the 1964 production year for the bus.  We think it was 15 NOV 63.
