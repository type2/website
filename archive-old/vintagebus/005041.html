Was just about to take my case apart today and three of the engine bolts on
top holding the case together are stuck inside the holes, and I haven't been
able to twist them out with pliers. Do I need to have them drilled? If so,
does putting a thread insert inside weaken the case or is there anything i
should watch out for in this procedure? Thanks.
