Well here I go again, I recieved my 3.88 r/p 77 4th gear trans from Rancho
today and am going to install it in my DD with the small nut r/b, had a 3.88
r/p 82 4th in the 62 swap panel (now residing in Utah) with the small nut
and loved it so now we'll (me) will see what the difference will be with the
77 4th gear.

ronnie

ps; hope to have installed for the Classic journey.

pss: my 55 barndoor left Texas today and should be in my possession this
weekend, Sat or Sunday, what a great mothers day present, I hope my wife
likes it!! much better then flowers. Looks like I won't make the Prescott
show though.
