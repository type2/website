Subject: Wolfsburg Mud and Snow tires
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 09:58:30 -0800

So,

	I was at the VW show in Vallejo, CA yesterday and passed up the
chance to purchase two **NEW** wolfsburg mud and snow tires for the bus.
They were 7.14 x 14 biasply tires labeled WOLFSBURG and made in the U.S.A.

	He only wanted $80 a pair.

	Was I a fool to pass them up?  (I thought, maybe if I had a shop, I
could display them, 'cuz I have no real practical use in mind.)

	I guess I should have gottena  phone number just in case one of you
guys were in need.... sorry...

	On a lighter note, I did happen to find some a couple of cool things
at the swap.  Other than that, the show was less than mediocre.
