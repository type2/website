&gt;---&gt; What if your brake system fails in any way that causes the fluid to
&gt;exit.  On a 1966 and earlier bus, you lost all braking...
&gt;&lt;--- Next step is to use the mechanical cable we all call the &quot;e-brake&quot; or
&gt;&quot;parking (rust in place) brake&quot;..
================

Oh hell, that's why I chose a walk-trough for the cross town go getter. If
the brake system fails I just jump into the rear REAL quick and hide. =8I&gt;

The '63 is truly iffy enough that folks are (for reals) constantly pointing
at my rear wheel indicating that I have a warped drum or twisted wheel.
&lt;wobble,wobble,wobble,etc.&gt;

At 52MPH I signal back in international sign language,  &quot;I know that I'm a
slow moving loser white guy holding up traffic on the freeway like a
clueless illegal immygruntin in a landscaping truck and I have a fugged up
bus but the ol' lady has the good one.&quot;
The trouble is that by the time that I raise the middle finger they are
miles down the road...

Each time that I park the bastard it poops tranny fluid from the rear and
brake fluid from the single circuit MC. I just fire up the bus, listen to
the dropped seat in #3 and thump on home. Ah, the joys of being the Hot VWs
Cover Shot king. Paula has the tits up RFH for her 3 mile commute-while I do
nearly 75 per day... There is a clue in the last sentence indicating why she
has the good bus... ;-)
