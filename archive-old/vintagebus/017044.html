I've seen guys sending their girls to bargain on parts.  I remember _at_ Kelly
Park a couple years ago, I watched this skimpily dressed thang peel off from 
her man, sidle over to a table, picked up a set of bug taillights, 
and asked &quot;how much for the heart taillights&quot; - only the taillights she 
picked up were not heart taillights!  The swap guy was confused, the girl 
is confused, and she turns and looks back to the boyfriend, who looks 
embarassed as hell. (that wasn't Matt &amp; Katie, was it?)

If you're going to &quot;use&quot; a woman for something like this, at least
*educate* her first so you don't both look like idiots.

I think I'm enough of a hardass that I wouldn't fall for that, knowing
now that it's a common ruse.  I'd prolly ask double.  If nothing else
we could &quot;negotiate&quot; the difference...
