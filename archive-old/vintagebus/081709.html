Subject: Re: [VB] Steering boxes

   The new Brazilian steering boxes that I have now come with the correct pitman arm (they didn't before). You will 
need to take the mounting/frame collar and have it machined to fit over the nose of the box (they used to come with 
the correct  mounting collar) and you could use a bay pitman arm

&gt;Some one else will finish this, but the new ones need modification to 
&gt;fit (bending the frame? ) maybe you can find information in the old 
&gt;messages.
&gt;All we know have used rebuilt as that is what is available.  Who has the 
&gt;new ones and how much the rebuilt are about $225. We are going to 
&gt;install a good used one.
