You are bidding on a new Volkswagon Beetle Master Cylinder. This unit is
new in genuine manufactures box. Never been used or rebuilt. This unit will
fit
perfectly into you 1967-78 Beetle to restore the new brake feel. This unit
was recently purchased from a local dealer for $59.00, selling on ebay now
starting at $22.99. Email any questions.



My question to the seller:

*************


What does this mean?:

&quot;This unit is new in genuine manufactures box.&quot;

This seems like deliberately misleading language.  'Genuine' *should* mean
OEM, such as ATE or VW.

Or perhaps you were only referring to the box itself as being &quot;genuine&quot;?...

What is the manufacturer of your master cylinder?

Thanks,

Kabayo
