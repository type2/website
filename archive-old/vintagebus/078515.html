Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

&gt;...We have heat waves here in the NW
&gt;that match Texas weather


now, IIRC, eric was based in TX at some point, so you KNOW that ain't true!
one summer in austin it was over 100 deg for over a MONTH, at 80% humidity.

seems like winter now, what with the 120 day and 101 night here  in 
phoenix last year ... and it is already 94! (so jim ellis sez - i am 
in minnesota right now).

even then the tar didn't really stink. it DID get soft enough for me 
to scrape away some excess here and there.
