Lou,

You've got a problem, that's the worst case of bus infestation I've ever
seen, and not normal b's either, they are the dreaded &quot;Capital B&quot;.I'd &quot;B&quot;
glad to keep that bus in the midwest for you until those B's die off.
In the meantime you should call the local apiary......and no they don't keep
apes,
they keep B's.
John
