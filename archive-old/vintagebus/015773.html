Subject: 67 Splitty with Bug Fuel Injection
Date: Tue, 04 Apr 2000 01:56:29 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, here goes... I'm to build a 1641 with 75-79 bug fuel injection and put 
it in my 67. There should be no reason this doesnt work! Right? I'm going to 
install a 75-79 bus gas tank and a F.I. beetle starter. Other than that, the 
only wiring I have to do is from the fuel pump relay to the fuse block(Just 
like in my 76). Seems alright huh? Come on all...the real reason I'm telling 
ya'll this is for feedback. We all know that a mostly stock 1600 in a 
splitty gets better gas mileage than any other bus made(ie. 
2litre,waterboxer). We all know that fuel injection always gets better 
mileage than carburetors right? Well, in these times of fuel insanity, I'm 
going to see if I can coax every possible bit of gas mileage out of a bus 
that I can. Lets just call this project sip-split! I've heard that people 
can get about 27mpg out of their buses, but I'm going to shoot for 33! I 
think that it's possible with alot of coaxing but still possible. Of course, 
I'll bring a backup carb system when I venture this thing into the heart of 
mexico this summer. I also need to know the honest truth about the mostly 
reliable and efficient way to keep this motor kool in the heat of this 
summer. I've driven my 76 bus with 2 litre to hell and back in the utah salt 
flats with the stock cooling system and have since put 30,000 miles on the 
motor and the thing is still my daily driver. But alas, I have entered the 
splitty kingdom and know little about the type1 motor's kooling 
kapabilities.
Let me know what you think about the F.I. and kooling this thing. Please 
dont tell me the cons about F.I. other than the cost because I know the 
system very well. Hope this works out well. Peace, Sam
