&gt; Didn't take a lot of force, just take a close look to see that you're 
&gt; hitting the right thang.  Then you can reach thru from the other side 
&gt; and knock out the near one.

Well that worked so easy I can't believe I didn't try it first. I
looked through the hole in the side gear &amp; said &quot;surely there isn't
enough clearance to tap the back side of the gear&quot; Well there was. 
 
&gt; Check the archives for posts from Clara and E&amp;B to me on my project, 
&gt; just in the past couple of weeks.  They (and others) have been loads of 
&gt; help.

Yes! Thanks Clara &amp; E&amp;B for your help in these issues as well. 

&gt; I got the redux boxes back together this weekend and the whole schmeer 
&gt; is sitting in the carport behind the bus waiting for a couple of 
&gt; friends to come over and help me horse it back into place.  Not much 
&gt; longer to go now....

Way to go. I just have to tap out the mounting bolts for the RGB &amp;
then put the transmission back in &amp; I'm ready to go! Well after my
engine gets here that is :)
