While there are &quot;horses for courses&quot; when it comes to oil, generally newer is 
better. Old engines with tired seals will leak with synthetic. Rebuilt 
engines generally will not. I run Redline (racing synthetic, $8/qt) 20/50 in 
my 1600 DP/67 Westy. Good oil pressure, good temps, and confidence to be able 
to rev the engine and endure heat. It is a rebuild with about 30,000 miles on 
it, 20,000 on synthetic. No leaks. Still change the oil every 3,000. More 
expensive than dino? Yes, But I drive it hard and don't wonder if the oil is 
okay. 
Our 911 has had Castrol Syntec 5/50 since we bought it with 90,000 miles on 
it. No leaks at 135,000.
Synthetic is better oil, but without an oil filter, the Type 1 motors can't 
utilize the longer oil change interval that is available for more modern 
engines. Still, I have more comfort with the Synthetic and that is worth $ to 
me.
