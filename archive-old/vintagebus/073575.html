Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation

Mt '62 DC had the expanding foam packed inside ALL interior door/wall
cavities.  Took me two days to chip it all out and POR the bottoms where
the surface rust had started.  Good thing it lived its life in So. CA or
it would have rotted from the inside out.

&gt; The '64 Singlecab I just picked up had the same problem. Matted up pink
&gt; insulation collecting moisture and rusting everything from the inside up. Try
&gt; the self adhesive rubberized sheets sold at J.C. Whitney. The are the same
&gt; that are sold custom/rod shops for much more money!
