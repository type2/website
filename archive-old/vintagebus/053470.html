Subject: 12 Volt Bus Flasher,  Black Box

Was someone on the list looking for one of these? Found one under the garage
workbench. Don't know where it came from or if it works. Will send to
whomever needs it , and if it works pay me for it. As Ellis says, if you
snooze you loose. Also anyone out there need a 18/21 foot boat trailor?
Tandem axles, needs some cleanup. No paper work, tow it home. $200 as is,
more as I work on it, would make a nice bus hauler.
