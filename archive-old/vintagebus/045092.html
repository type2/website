Subject: 66 Progress, rust treatment
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all, now that I have resolved the engine issue in my splitty, I have 
decided to go ahead and start on the body.  The first stop is the 
windshields.  One is cracked and the other is just old.  Both have rust along 
the bottom sills.  Getting them out was fairly easy.  I just cut out the 
seals and popped em out.  The cracked one I unleashed a little aggression on 
with a rubber mallet.  The broken glass made me smile (nod to the punker 
days).  No guilt involved seeing as how it was destined for the scrapheap 
amyways.  The solid one is not original glass but I'll keep it anyway as a 
spare in case some kid goes after my bus with a BB gun again.

On to the problem at hand.  RUST.  Icky flaky nasty bus-killing stuff.  Upon 
close inspection, my 66 has A LOT of it.  I mean everywhere.  Too much to try 
and replace everything (I'd have a whole new bus!) but I would like to stop 
the spread if I could.  If I can keep it at bay then perhaps the bad spots 
can be cured later when I have more cash, more time and a few welding 
tutorials under my belt.  

I have read with great interest the letters about POR15 and am quite certain 
that this is the product of choice, but I have a few questions about it.  My 
trusty Rocky catalog lists POR15 Metal-Ready, POR15 Marine Clean, and POR15 
Rust Preventative Paint.  Are all three of these products necessary for the 
prevention and/or inhibition of rust?  From the description Metal-Ready and 
Marine-Clean seem to do the same thing but MR mentions bare metal where as MC 
does not.  Hmmm.  This is going to be my first true attempt at rust repair 
and I want to do it right (as right as I can without cutting out the bad 
metal and welding in new metal).  
Do I have to sand away to bare &quot;virgin&quot; metal or can I just sand the bad area 
smooth and go from there?  On my window sills, sanding to clean metal will 
remove most of the lip.  The metal is sturdy but definitely rust damaged.  
Can I just break off the loose pieces, clean it up real nice and POR15 it?  
Is this a wasted effort?    

Also, I have heard people talk about troubles getting a good seal on the 
windshields.  Since the lip is rusty on mine I can safely assume this will be 
a problem for me.  Some have mentioned using roofing tar for a good seal.  
How is this applied?  Do you slop it onto the sill, install the window and 
the clean what squishes out or do you install the window first?  

And last but not least, can anyone recommend a good source for windshield 
glass?  I have seen glass for $150.00 a pair as well as $45 a piece.  Why the 
price differences?  Is the more expensive glass worth the investment or is 
glass glass.  Is Securit glass collectible glass to be pillaged or is it 
readily available at your favorite VW supplier?  I'm not a NOS snob but most 
of my glass is Securit so it would be cool to keep it uniform.  

Well OK, I do have one more question, While crawling around my bus it appears 
the dash is removable.  Just a few bolts here and there and working around 
what few wires there are.  After doing extensive dash work on a baywindow, I 
fear getting into something and having a difficult time finishing the job.  
Is removing the dash really as easy as it appears?  It would certainly make 
it a lot easier to paint.  It really could use a quality coat.

Enough for now, I'll have tons more questions later.

Thanks in advance
