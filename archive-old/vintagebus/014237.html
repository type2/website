Okay, gang-

Before the thread grows, I'd like to say that perhaps I was too strong in my 
public oppinion about the UPS folks. I concede that the shear volume makes 
it dificult to treat packages individually. I didn't mean it to go as deep 
as it sounded.

Now, someone buy my Bus!!! I must write terrible ads, cause noone is 
flocking to my door. Running/driving '65 13-Window Deluxe walkthrough with 
new floors, anyone?

Be you-           -EJ
