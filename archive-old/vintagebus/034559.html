Hi Brad,
You really should get the 1972 and later bus master cylinder for about $35.00
and use a rabbit resivoir on top of it.  Make a 1/4&quot; thick spacer to go
between the MC and it's mounting place.  You will have to use longer bolts to
mount the new MC and the 1/4&quot; spacer.  Shorten the brake pedal push rod with
hacksaw and file the end round again.  Move the  forward brake sender from the
bottom of the MC to the side hole and install a short section of steel brake
line(6-8&quot; long from bus disc brakes works well)into the bottom hole in the MC
from there to the a brass T-fitting (From any VW rear brake system.) for both
of the front brake lines to thread into.  If this short line is bent carefully
you can and should be able to install your belly pan to keep the dust and
debris away for your control linkage/parts.  Total cost of the conversion is
less than $50.00 and gives you the piece of mind that if your brake system
fails you will still have at least half of your brakes left instead of none.

PS Make sure that you do not mix the front left brake line up with the brake
line to the rear brakes or the bus will definitly pull to one side.  Plus keep
the metal brake lines at least a minuim of an inch away from any moving
linkage or cables when you do this conversion. EEE&amp;B
