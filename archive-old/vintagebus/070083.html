Subject: Gearbox earth strap and rear crossmember brake line

Before I refit my gearbox I want to make sure I fit the new brake line correctly.  I removed it months ago to measure up the new one - however I can't see how it should go across the rear crossmember between the T piece and the first clip on the framehorns.  Anyone know?
Also the earth strap - I am fitting a new one, but does it go on behind the front mount (i.e. put the strap on first, before sliding the mount on) or does it go on top of the mount and earth through the nut?

Thanks
Paul
