ok, it's friday so i'll chime in.

you GOTTA be kidding me! like phil lesh can't afford a liver?!?!?!? not that
i don't feel for him. i'm a bass player like phil and enjoy his music. but
c'mon, the dead was/is one of the most profitable bands throughout the
mid-eighties into the '90's! tell 'em to sell one of his alembic basses.
that'll pay for the liver alone!
