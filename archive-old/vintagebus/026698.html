Subject: Exhaust gasket

For those of you who have the &quot;merged extractor&quot; style exhaust, I have a
question.  My bus has a 1641cc engine with a merged extractor and single
quiet pack muffler on it.  When I started it up yesterday, I noticed it
was rather loud.  After checking out some obvious areas, it appears that
the gasket between the extractor outlet and muffler flange is gone,
letting most of the noise and exhaust out through that point.  Enough
background.

My question is - should I put anything on the new gasket to promote
sealing between the two pieces of exhaust?  I used to put oil on it, but
a friend recommended against that.  Some kind of gasket-in-a-tube type
product?  Oil?  Nothing?

Thanks,

Paul
