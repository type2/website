Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage


Can the springs themselves be changed to alter the pressure settings?

&gt;
&gt;Okay, I knew that I should have researched what I was told before I
&gt;posted to the list. I hate to get the terminology wrong. They were
&gt;indeed talking about the plungers and the long &amp; short spring being
&gt;inverted.
&gt;
&gt;It turns out that I'm not able to pick it up yet, of course. The oil
&gt;pressure is still ~90psi and they fear that I might blow another filter
&gt;during the normal warm-up period. They are trying to find ways to bring
&gt;that down so I don't run into trouble.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts? Thinner oil has been suggested, but maybe there are some
&gt;other methods? I am not sure of the performance of the oil pump and it
&gt;has been suggested that it is a &quot;high-pressure&quot; unit...

&gt;
&gt;i don't think there is any physical way for the long spring to fit in
&gt;the
&gt;front (short) relief hole, especially with a plunger in there too. i
&gt;could
&gt;see the short one in the rear hole though, but the long one in the
&gt;short?
&gt;i'd like to see that.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt;   Could they have meant the plungers?  Or was the long spring and the
&gt;short
&gt; &gt; spring reversed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ronnie
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, it turns out that the springs in the oil pump were reversed. Not
&gt; &gt; sure how *that* happened, but just glad that it's well again. I'm
&gt;going
&gt; &gt; to pick it up now...
