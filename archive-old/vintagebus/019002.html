Why not the 5L 12 cylinder?

&gt; And then when the dream is over, go with a nice single port 1641.

&gt; Actually, all kidding aside, if you can aford a porsche 911 6, this engine 
&gt; will give you what a bus could really use. Its almost too bad that this air 
&gt; cooled option isnt more readily available.

Actually, they generally are available, as people are always wrecking turbos.
It's just a matter of having a wallet with the appropriate capacity.
