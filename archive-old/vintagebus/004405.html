I was out of touch last Friday and couldn't contribute to my own topic.
Tray #1 - nothing - no paint - soda blasted clean (BTW did you know that
the model # is handwritten on the divider before it's painted? Barely
visible after blasting - 265)
Tray #2 - glued on vinyl (mx code?) panel screws, fuses, faucet wrench
that barely functions as a church key,

I'm going down to San Diego to pick up an Electric Thing tomorrow. Honk
if you see it between here and Fresno, behind a brown F*rd doublecab.

Truck bumper picture soooon, stay tuned.
