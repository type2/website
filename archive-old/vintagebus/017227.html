It seems to me that some people might be doing
biodiesel fuel based on the work and research of
others. I first read about it in &quot;Homepower&quot;  magazine
a year or two ago, and the folks at this website offer
a book on the subject, written a couple of years ago
if I recall correctly.

Sorry, their van wasn't a VW, but I just want to set
the record straight (or cause more confusion).
