Subject: How much gear oil in a tranny?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Rounded up some GL-4, a 17MM Hex wrench, and a handy little fluid pump
today so I could change the fluid in my tranny and reduction gear boxes.
Followed all the advice from the archives on making sure the filler plug
would come off before draining. The magnetic drain plugs had some small
metal filings on them. More on the one towards the nosecone than the one
towards the engine. The fluid didn't look bad at all. It was fairly clean.
So I'm filling the tranny back up with the gear oil and I'm wondering how
much should go in there. I know you fill it up almost all the way to the
drain plug, but I wan't to know how much gear oil that is so I'll know when
I should be in the ball park. The gl-4 I got (sta-lube, 90) came in quarts.
2 pints are 1/2 a quart....right?

Thanks for the info.
