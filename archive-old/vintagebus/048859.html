Subject: Found the problem...pt. 3 in a 3 part series

Wow...this list is great! With the zero responses I got, I ended up 
solving my own problem. Maybe I should post some off topic stuff like 
there's been lately and I could actually get a response! (Ok...it's 
just some sarcastic commentary...I know everyone is at shows or 
having  fun...it is Sunday afterall)

Anyway.....

Me being the cheapskate I am, I saved the old voltage regulator that 
was on my bus. I had no idea if it was good or not, so I figured I 
might need to save it just in case. You see, everyone always says to 
swap out your voltage regulator when you replace your generator...if 
one is bad, the other is probably going out as well...so I did what I 
was SUPPOSED to do.

I dug out my old one a few minutes ago, cleaned it up, swapped it out 
with the brand new Bosch unit with only 3000 miles on it, and started 
the engine. No more green light.

So now I've got a brand new unit with 3000 miles on it sitting on my 
desk that is already broke. What the &quot;F&quot;?!?!?!? I did what I was 
SUPPOSED to do. I replaced the old one. I bought the &quot;right&quot; one. And 
I'm now using the old one and the new one is broke and I'm out my 
time and my money...which the parts maker and parts sellers have now 
have. JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!! PISSED PISSED PISSED PISSED!!!! BEER 
BEER BEER BEER BEER!!!! (you notice there is an extra beer 
there....that's 'cause I'll be having an extra one)

See Ya!
