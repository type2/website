&lt;&lt; I eBay parts all the time.  As does Everett and as
 does Thom...in fact I recall one of them even had a
 seprate web page where you could go and see what he
 has to bid on? (correct me if I am wrong and I may
 be)...anyways I am not knocking that...I just find it
 strange when very active eBayers and knockin some one
 else for doin it?   &gt;&gt;


Well, I've always thought of Auctions as a place where the excitement causes 
people to spend more for something then it is truly worth. Especially if 
there are uninformed bidders involved, which is obviously the case on eBay!

Most individuals on this list know enough about this stuff to not overpay. 

So, if you want top $$ or hopefully more then its worth, sell it on eBay!

If a &quot;fair&quot; price is satisfactory to you and you're more in to the 
camaraderie of this list, sell it here or at least give the &quot;list&quot; your first 
shot.

Shields up!
