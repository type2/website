&lt;&lt; Do you guys think this setup will work?&gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
Not for very long or well!
 
&lt;&lt;If it does, do you think it will power a space heater?&gt;&gt;
What wattage?  Most are over 1,000 watts.  Dividing 1,000 watts by 12 volts 
gives you 83.3 amps.  You will at the least need a second alternator just to 
run the heater system.  
 
&lt;&lt;Is it safe?&gt;&gt;
 Not really unless you beef up the heater wiring to starter cable size.

&lt;&lt; Where's the best place to hook up the ground wire?&gt;&gt;
To a body part.
 
&lt;&lt;Please keep in mind that i'm a novice in the field of wiring.&gt;&gt;
Turning the burning of fuel in to electricity and back into heat is really a 
lousy system and ineffective with losses of energy at each conversion.  Plus 
the inverter will cause even more of a draw.
Best then to just go over your whole stock heating system and revamp it!  Are 
all of the parts there?  Do you need to weld up holes in the heater boxes and 
body tubing?  Make sure to run the thermostatic flaps system and even install 
a set of insulation panels from a set of type 3 heater boxes on your type 1&amp;2 
boxes.  If still you have not gotten enough heat for your comfort/climate it 
is time for the gas heater installation.  Eric&amp;Barb
