Subject: Fiberglass Insulation in doors.

Here's my .02

I had a panel bus that that PO used fiberglass insulation in to quite it 
down.  Unfortunately when I went to restore the vehicle and removed the 
panels, I found the bus was rusting from the inside out.  The fiberglass 
insulation only needed to get a little bit of water on it and the watter 
would wick its way up the inside of the panel.  The water would then sit on 
the inside of the panel with the fiberglass and cause all kinds of rust.   
IT WAS A HUGE MESS.  Since that little experience, I would not put 
fiberglass in unless you could make sure it didn't get wet.

Just my experience, take it for what its worth.
Mike
