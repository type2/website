I will lurk...sometimes to say a thing or two...but I'll not be as
involved in the lists as I have for the past 3 years or so.
I've been promoted...it means more hours...less of a life too.  
It should be happening within a week or two I figure.
My home e-mail is
showell_at_i405_dot_com
I'll probably go thru some withdrawl..so at first I'll try to get in some
&quot;fixes&quot; to hold me over until I can get used to the idea of not checking
in on all of you on a daily basis.  It's going to be hard.
The members of this community are an asset I have come to value...ups and
downs being a part of it, I'd have it no other way.
later
