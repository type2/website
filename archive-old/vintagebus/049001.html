Any opinions out there on how to best restore/refurbish early bus hardboard sunvisors?  Mine are in nice shape, i.e. the cardboard isn't separating, no gouges, very minimal warping, no dings on the edges.  But like almost everyone I've seen, the paint has spiderwebbed like mad and is flaking off like a snowstorm in the Rockies.

I believe there is a texture to the cardboard/hardboard itself as well as a pattern etched in, so I don't want to get carried away with a sanding block.

Light sanding and just respray?  I was hoping there would be a 12 step process so I can complicate my restoration even more than I already have.  All tips and advice are always appreciated.

And no wise cracks from you either Rex!  :)

Robert
