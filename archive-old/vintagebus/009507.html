That's good advice, Eric, but it's an exercise in futility if that crummy
aftermarket distributor clamp is cracked.

Check the clamp very thoroughly.  If it's cracked the torque from the
Distributor drive can move the distributor and change the timing  -
sometimes suddenly and radically.  BTDT.

The fault is not obvious unless you remove the clamp and inspect it
carefully.  And of course, running with a loose distributor can result in a
fried engine.

New factory distributor clamps seem to have gone NLA.  We've tried a lot of
aftermarket clamps over the years, and most are so soft/weak that the
combination of engine heat and the pressure of the clamp bolt will render
them incapable of clamping properly in very little time.  Or, they just
crack.  Either way can strand you when/where you'd prefer no to be stranded.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Yes we have!  Due to badly made aftermarket distributor clamps that only
contact the distributor at two or three points instead of all the way around
the clamp interior circumferance.  Either get a original or sit down and
half round file the aftermarket distributor clamp so it's interior is more
round and contacts better with the distributor.  &lt;&lt;
