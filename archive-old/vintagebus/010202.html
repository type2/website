Vehicle access to my daughter's High School main entrance is up a long,
steep drive that is permanently posted &quot;Buses Only&quot;.  At dismissal time an
occupied police cruiser is parked right at the top by the entrance.

For 2 years I've routinely motored up the drive in OUR &quot;bus&quot; to pick up my
kid, and the cop ALWAYS smiles and waves :)

The funny part was that one road by the school is
blocked off 3 times a day for the bus kids.  There is a big sign that says,
&quot;Road Closed Bus Only.&quot;  I wonder what kind of legal loopholes I could pull
off by driving through there.  The sign DOES NOT say school buses - just
'Bus Only.&quot;  I think that includes me. :-)
