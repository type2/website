&lt;&lt; I think the lack of demand is due to lack of knowledge.  You can't want 
 something you don't know exists.   I can't tell you how many times at a show 
 I have been asked &quot;How long did it take you to make that?&quot; by folks who have 
 been in the Volkswagen hobby for several years.  They don't know what it is. 
&gt;&gt;

This is also true with early hardtop deluxes.  I always get the &quot;too bad it 
doesnt have all the little windows and a sunroof&quot; routine when people see it 
at my house.  Oh poor un VW knowledged population, how I pity you!
