i have never seen one with the p/n on it either but i noticed that the
seller is posting it from 'chermany so mebbe that is a europe only item??

if not someone went to a lot of effort to stamp in the supposed p/n and
fab up the &quot;aged&quot; looking packaging..

fwiw i have a &quot;canada only&quot; comparably sized slot head screwdriver for opening
the church key lock ..
