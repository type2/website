Subject: [VB] Tranny woes in Santa Cruz

I've searched the Archives and not had any luck.  Can anyone recommend a shop in the Santa Cruz, CA area that can repair my big nut reduction box?  The right side stub axle keeps coming loose and it is making weird noises, so I need to get it fixed fast.

I would go to Volks Cafe, except they supposed rebuilt a previous reduction box of mine and it had a similar problem (right side nut working loose).  I think the nut on the inside might not have been properly peened during re-assembly.
