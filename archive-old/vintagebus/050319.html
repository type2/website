Subject: Chassis number

Hello-

As I was wrestling with an electrical problem this weekend (and losing -
see my next missive), I decided to check the chassis number.  I found loads
of info in the archives, except where to find it!

Muir says to the right of the engine in the engine compartment.  Didn't see
it - can somebody help me with a more specific location?

Thanks
