Subject: Re: [VB] Re: 002 - preheat flap delete 

the only place ive seen preheat flap delete mentioned, is the vintagebus_dot_com 
mcode decipher program. I did find a german page one time that said 002 was 
'sealed beam headlights USA export.' I listed both of them on my site and 
have never received any other feedback on it.

&gt; First, I'd like to find out where you tracked down &quot;preheat flap delete&quot;
&gt; as a description of M-Code 002.  I've been looking for a list with 002
&gt; on it for years.
