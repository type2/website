Subject: early vs late gearshift rod front support - opinions sought
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am debating which type of gear shift linkage to put back in my '63 deluxe 
project.  

Experts can skip this-
The stock '63 linkage has the bolted on gearshift rod support which encircles 
the rod.  I cut the other support out of my 67 donor.  It is the type with 
the dowel pin at the front of the gearshift rod.  All this is shown very 
clearly on Bently page H-9-2 and 3.  The change was in September 65.

Back to my question-
Anyway, all the busses I have driven, including friends busses, have been the 
later dowel pin type.  So I don't know what the early type &quot;feels&quot; like.  I 
am putting in a Rancho stock 67 tranny.  I took measurements of the dowel 
before I cut it out of the donor, so I am ready to weld it in.  Also, I have 
have all the matching parts for both systems.

Comments and opinions appreciated.
