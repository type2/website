&gt; &lt;&lt; I don't think that there is a criminal penalty for transplanting a
&gt;  sunroof onto a bus!  Fact is, any given bus could have had a sunroof
&gt;  if the build order had specified it at the factory.  Swapping one on
&gt;  later isn't all that nasty of a thing to do as long as it's done in a
&gt;  workmanlike manner. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; But don't you feel guilty, that you were not happy with how your bus
was as
&gt; you got it? You want to make it something it is not, you will hurt its
&gt; feelings.

Well, my bus had a bad steering box when I got it and I had no remorse
at all when I swapped it out.  Same with swapping in the '73 disk
brakes, etc.  I'm even pondering putting a 5 cm diameter hole (with
weatherproofing) in the roof between the front seats to accommodate my
need for a transmitter-hunting antenna.  Like any good marriage, my
bus and I learn to adapt to one another's needs.  :)

&gt; Anyone have a bus with a good cargo door section? I want to make
&gt; mine a double door.

Sounds like a great idea.  I think that VW reinforced the frame when
this option was installed, so make sure that you duplicate that
metalwork as well!
