  Hi all,
 There are many of us out here that are lurkers, caught up in our own lives
and livelihoods but still here.  It is going to take more of us folks that are
waiting in the shadows to start adding to this list, Lis &amp; I will start to add
more as time goes by.
  It's great to hear that Clara is going to come to Jerome next week, we met
briefly when she wintered here and worked at Ronnie's shop awhile back.  At
that time our '61 Westy was still in many pieces, remember when it was
infested with bees(twice, right TOM?)?  We now have over 10K miles on the
'fat' motor and it still runs fine.
  I've attached a link to my summer project, a '71 Sears trailer that will
hold our bulky camping gear:
     http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_dragon/UnNamed.html
 It's finally done and the last two pix are from today.  I took the Westy out
on the highway (ambient temps around 110-112 deg.), at the same time I finally
wired up the remote oil cooler so that the fan will come on when the oil gets
to a certain temp.  Well I first ran out to I-40, app. 20 miles, without the
fan running, oil temps going up the looong hill held at 222ish, came back and
adjusted the fan setting so with the cooler fan on it dropped to 200ish going
back to I-40, I like it!  Remember it was around 110-112 out.
  I have never seen the oil temps over 225 so I know the motor runs cool
enough normally but with the trailer I wanted a little more piece of mind!
  Looking forward to Jerome, we are leaving Havasu Thurs. morn so we can walk
around Jerome and take in the sights.  We'll be at the 'Jerome Grand Hotel'
Thurs. night(some say it was once a hospital for the criminally insane, hmmm,
the restaurant there is called the &quot;Asylum&quot;
   Still out here,
     Lou &amp; Lis
