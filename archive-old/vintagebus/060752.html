&gt; front axel, how much do you tighten the two nuts do you do them the same?

Hi Chisam27,
We tighten the inner nut till you feel it seat against the bearings as you 
spin the wheel/drum.  Then back off the inner nut 1/6-1/8 turn and tighten 
the outer nut against the inner and lock tab them or tighten the later model 
single spindle nut with an Allen wrench in place.  You can easily make a thin 
wrench for the inner earlier nut out of 1/8 sheet steel with a hacksaw, 
drill, and file.
