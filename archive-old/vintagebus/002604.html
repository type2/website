I was cleaning out a '64 double cab I had purchased about 4 years ago from a
VW shop in Reno, NV.  Underneath the front seat I found an old looking penny
roll paper with a name on it. What few pennies I found were 70's and 80's.
I looked up the name on the internet whitepages for the Reno area and got a
ph#. I called and found it was the son of the original owner of the bus,
they had sold the bus to the VW shop which I had purchased it from making me
it's 3rd owner, otherwise I would have never known it's history.

Subject: [VB] Pennies under the floor


&gt; When I pulled the interior out my new 65 EZ Camper, I found a pint glass
&gt; full of change, and some ohter little medallions.  Most are so full of
crud
&gt; and oxidation that i Couln't make head or tails out of them.  I poured
some
&gt; stop n' shop cola into the glass, and am now waiting for results.  I
vaguely
&gt; remember a summer camp trick where you put an old penny in a glass, the
dude
&gt; poured something in (Alka Seltzer?) and a while later, you had a shiny
&gt; penny.  Any thoughts or rememberances?  The earliest one I've found so far
&gt; was a 1967 Denver, screwed into the floor under the mat between the front
&gt; seats.  This kind of stuff gets my wife interested our &quot;fifth car!!!&quot;
