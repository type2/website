Not that I'm accused of being a barndoor owner or
anything... &lt;thank God&gt; ;-)

My opinion is that if you obtained the bus with the
Behr scoop already in place then rejoice and be
proud!. If your bus currently doesnt have it installed
then I personally would vote to NOT install it for the
reasons that you have previously stated. Save the
Peaks! was the battle cry around Flagstaff, AZ in the
mid 1970's. (San Francisco Peaks-environmentalist vs
developer fight of that era). Today I'd apply it to
the remaining barndoor buses.

The scoop on the infamous '54 Barnambulator was pretty
bitchen, worked well in both 6V speeds and was nice to
have. I don't think that I would have installed it if
it didnt come with the bus. Being a true ambulance
body it was appropriate for that bus. In that light it
was a cool example of what a real original,complete
and fully functioning &quot;ambo&quot; fan was all about. As for
the poptop- now that was a &quot;hole&quot; 'nother story. =(!
