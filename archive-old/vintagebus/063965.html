Subject: seasons greetings and two questions

Dear Vintage bus list,
I've been wanting to write for some time. I'm afraid I've been a
&quot;lurker&quot; for several months. Reading and learning from the postings on the
list.Its the holidays an I have a little time off so it seems like a good
time to write. I have two questions to ask. One is sort of a personal
curiosity I have and the other involves a project I got involved with. I
know the list is limited to maintenance issues for the mostpart, but I hope
this first question will be accepted in the spirit that its asked.
My name is Mike Turner. I'm a retired navy senior chief petty officer. I
wore the &quot;blue suit&quot; for thirty years, retiring from active duty in 1987. My
specialty was aviation maintenance, airframe repair to be exact. After the
service, I pursued a career in aircraft maintenance
working for Boeing aircraft in Seattle, then for the navy as a contract
aircraft mechanic.Currently I'm working for the navy in a civilian capacity
in Japan.I'm located at Naval Air Facility, Atsugi, about thirty five miles
south east of Tokyo.I've been here about three years.
I hope to be heading home to Washington state next year.
I've been involved with Volkswagons most of my adult life.My first ride in a
VW was in 1957 while stationed in at NAS Alameda, california.I was attached
to an attack squdron there, an one of the guys I worked with
had a bug. Don't recall if it was a 56 or 57, bit I remember it didn't have
a gas gauge, just a lever on the floor to flip over when you ran out of fuel
to go to reserve.It ran like a new watch and was fun to drive.I don't recall
seeing any busses at the time only bugs.
My first ride in a bus was 1963.In November that year, after completing a
tour of overseas shore duty in Japan, I transferred to the states with
orders to Miramar Naval Air station in San Diego, California.I was a newly
wed with a brand new Japanese bride. We arrived in the U.S. at the airport
in San Francisco. We were picked up there by a married navy buddy I had
served with earlier in Japan.His wife, also Japanese had known my wife
there. They had preceeded us to the states, arriving  eight months earlier,
assigned to a squadron based at NAS Alameda.
We planned to spend a few days with them, shake the jet lag,perhaps get my
new bride a brief on life in the land of the &quot;big PX&quot;.Leading us out to the
airport parking area we boarded a beautifull 1963 non sun roof
deluxe bus. The top was grey and below its chrome beltline it was red a kind
of wine colored red.It had &quot;step-thru&quot; seats in front,interior chrome
everywhere, and a saphire radio.It also had that wonderfull &quot;new car&quot;
smell.My friend shared with us that it had the new engine for that year, the
1500.With four adults and baggage, it moved out with no strain, staying with
the traffic.The bus with financing had cost him about thirty two hundred
bucks.that was a lot of dollars in 1963.He was a first class petty officer
with about 11 or 12 years in service.I was a seconed class petty officer
with six years. At the time my monthly pay was a &quot;rompin' stompin&quot; $375.00 a
month. It would be a while before I could afford a bus. Two days later,
November 22, my friend and I left his house for the twenty minute or so
drive to the base.I was going to stop at disbursing and draw some advance
pay to finance our move to San Diego and also I hoped to &quot;hook up&quot; with some
friend stationed there that I hadn't seen for several years.We left the
house a few minutes
before noon. I wanted to catch some music and reached over to flip on the
radio. I also wanted to hear how the speakers might sound.Turning on that
radio brought the world crashing in on us.My friend was off duty that day
and no one had been watching TV or listening to the radio at home. Thus we
were un-aware of the terrible events occuring in Dallas, Texas that
morning.The shooting of president John Kennedy and Texas govenor John
Connely.I recall we pulled over for a moment to listin. The news was
unbelievable! The base was like a ghost town when we arrived. Alameda is a
spawling complex with a major aircraft rework facility located on board. On
any given day there might be as many as
15,000 personel military and civilian moving about. Today the place was
deserted. we passed row after row of cavernous hangers with no one in sight.
Finaly pulling up to one were my old friends were assigned,we parked. Going
inside we crossed the vast hanger deck unchallenged.
The only sound heard was the echoing sound of radios and TV's. Everyone was
clustered around them listening to the news from Dallas.
For years after that tragic day, it was part of every conversation
What was your memory? Where were you when the president was shot? That was
mine.Life goes on however. My bride and I arrived in San Diego.She enrolled
in night school and I went to work.Instead of a Volkswagon I wound up with a
1959 ford Failane. By 1966 my fortunes changed. I was advanced to petty
officer first class. Also Congress saw fit to vote the military some pay
increases.Thus I was &quot;squatin in tall cotton&quot;
drawin' about $500. a month in navy pay plus a bit on the side from part
time work.Our first new car was a 1966 1300 deluxe sedan, a bug.
We ordered one in Java green. It came with steel sun roof,leatherette
interior,optional beauty rings on the tires,optional mud flaps,
saphire 4 AM/FM radio, with an gadget called a vibra-sonic mounted in the
truck.I had one speaker mounted in front and two mounted in the back on an
optional package shelve.The vibra-sonic electronicly delayed the signal
going to the rear speakers.The effect was sort of an echo chamber effect to
any music you might play.I bought the car at Truman motors Volkswagon in San
Diego. In 1966 they advertised...&quot;come see us at Truman Motors, you'll like
that place&quot;!!  Well they were right I did!! The car was delivered on a
friday in June with seven miles on the odometer.The next day we made our
first trip, to Anaheim and Disneyland.
It was a bright sunny day. After we parked, my wife stood up through the sun
roof and waved at me. I snapped her picture. The good lord has been kind to
us. After thirty six years we still have that picture and the same car.My
wife and I are workin' on thirty nine years together.
I really had wanted to get a bus, but I couldn't quite swing the price.
The bug cost 1860 plus financing (thru the Bank of America)brought the price
to twenty two hundred dollars. Payments were about eighty bucks a month.The
bus would have to wait a few more years.In the years we have owned the bug
however its carried us across the United States four times
including a trip across Canadas highway one (we entered Canada at
Vancouver,B.C. and re-entered the states at Niagra falls). We've camped in
it and slept in it.Years later after our daughter was born, she learned to
drive in it, and later drove the car as a college student in Seattle.In the
sixtys having a Volkswagon of any kind was more fun then you could ever
imagine. Just pulling up to a stop light you might find yourself in a mixed
group of bugs and busses. Unlike today when people wave as they pass, VW
drivers never waved, there were just to many on the road.Volkswagon actively
supported the aircooled folks then.
While my car was still in warranty (six months/six thousand miles)
I returned to Truman motors for service.I'm a big jazz fan,during the sixtys
the jazz scene was booming groups like the Modern Jazz Quartet,
and artists like Cal Tjader,George Shearing, Nina Simone, Dakota Staton,
and Ramsey Lewis to name a few were in their prime.Most of this was on FM.
On the AM side of the dial I was realy into a guy called
Wolfman Jack....he was &quot;da man&quot;. Thus I had most of the buttons on that
Saphire radio set. Yet on one occasion when I had my car serviced at Truman
Motors someone had selected a new station.It was a spanish station on the AM
side.As I drove away from the dealer I turned on the radio and listened to
some of the most beautifull spanish/mexican guitar
music I'd ever heard.I wish now I'd gone back an thanked the guy.A year
later we transferred to Whidbey Island in Washington state. My next
opportunity to get a bus came in 1975. I was back in San Diego on
temporary navy duty.I was invited to diner at the home of a retired navy
buddy.We got to talking Volkwagons. He was getting ready to buy a new &quot;big
window&quot; bus and wanted to sell his old one.He was the original owner of a
1966 bus, with about 70,000 miles on it.It was complete and he was asking
$700 dollars for it!! I turned him down.In todays world I would have been
all over him in a heart beat for a deal like that. However in that time
frame split windows were not that rare. Plus I was getting ready to return
to sea duty. I often think about that today, what a lack of foresight!! From
1979 to 1987 I was overseas with no opportunitys to get a bus. To make a
long story short I got my first bus (a project)after leaving the service in
1990. Over the next several years I aquired several bus projects. Most of
these I parted out. In 1995 I finally got the one I was looking for. A
partialy restored 1963
non-sunroof with step-thru front seats.Just like the one that we rode in
when we first arrived in the states.Its still not complete, but hopefully
when I get home next year it'll be on the road.I'm the third owner of this
bus. The first two owners were faculty members at the University of
Washington.the bus came off the assembly line the first week in February
1963. About six weeks later it came to Portland Oregon aboard one of VW's
car ferry vessels.At some point it was consigned by the distributer to
Carter Motors Volkswagon in Seattle. Thats where the original owner took
delivery. He kept the bus for 18 years, the seconed owner kept it for 14 and
now its in my care.The bus is basicly stock with the gear box's and 1500
engine. The electical system was upgraded to 12 volt and I installed a 009
distributer.The biggest problem I've experienced was rewiring the lights and
turn signals. I freely admit I had professional help to correct the
problem.We located a good nine
pin turen signal/switch box from a 67 donor bus and wired it into the bus
using the Bently 60 to 67 manual.As of three years ago it worked good
(smile). I've rambled enough...my first question is this....
are there any original splitwindow bus owners still driving their busses
out there? Without exception I read of busses being hauled out of the desert
or trucked from one place to another.But I've never heard or read of an
original owner of a 67 or earlier bus driving it or restoring it.I have read
of the occasional bug owner who has held on to their car,but no bus owners,
original owner anyway.I've read that between 1950 and 1967 about six million
busses were built. Don't know how many might have come to the states. But it
seems with those numbers
theres gotta be some original owners still drivin' their busses out there.
Anybody know of any? My seconed question is a maintenance one.
I've become friends with a Japanese navyman stationed here.He has a 1965
pop-top camper.He got the bus from someone who brought it from Australia.His
problem is the radio grill has been hacked to permit installing a larger
unit.He wants to restore it to original.He's come by a grill section from a
donor bus however its a 1967 grill.It has the larger opening. I have some
thoughts on how to do this job, but since
I never have done it in the past and of course neither has he, we are
reluctant to begin.We are both aware if its not a smooth,seamless job the
dash will look worse then it does now.I'm sorry I don't have any pictures to
send, but if any one has done this job any help,pictures,or good advice is
welcome.
Finally please forgive the rambling nature of this message. Won't do it
again,I promise.I do want to say this list is the greatest thing for bus
folks sinced they began slicing bread.Also want to wish all of you back in
the states a merry Christmas and Happy new year.One
Last thing, this season, please keep in your thoughts an prayers our young
men an women in uniform serving on ships, aircraft, and a variety of
unfriendly places
on the ground.Their payin' the price for our freedom.
Don't forget 'em.
respectfully, Mike turner
