Friday Foolishness (minimal VW content)

Great List:

Up here in this part of Northern California we seem to have alot of people 
who think &quot;differently&quot; than the rest of us.  Not everyplace is as hip as 
L.A.

Les Schwab Tires is currently running a tire promotion that would be the 
laughing stock in just about any region but this one.

FREE BEEF WITH A SET OF TIRES!

In their TV commercial, Les makes the anouncement while wearing a cowboy 
hat. A smiling family has just had new tires put on their pickup and the guy 
that just put them on reaches into a freezer and pulls out the beef (no 
inuendo intended).

I wonder what beef and tires have in common? Why not a free alignment or a 
pine tree shaped air freshener?  What do non-carnivorous people get?  Free 
salad?

Well, I guess next time you are driving your Bug or Bus through town and you 
get that hungry feeling, you now know were to get tires.
