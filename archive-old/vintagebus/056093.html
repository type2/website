Subject: RE: [VB] Sandblasting Prices

$400.... Do it!!!  But make sure you spend a couple of weeks blowing out all
the dust before you paint it!


John asked:
&gt; Just got back from showing the safari bus to the local sandblaster to get
a
&gt; quote. He wants $400.00 to do the whole bus with walnut shells.  He is
&gt; charging me an extra $100.00 because previous owner  had painted stripes
on
&gt; about 3/4's of the bus with house paint, said this was the hardest to take
&gt; off. It looks like there is about 5 different colors on the bus, price
&gt; includes doing both bumpers also. How does this compare with other areas?
&gt; I'm going to have him do the blasting next Wed. He said no warpage at all
&gt; with walnuts and the finish comes out great.  Check out article on BBBVI
in
&gt; May Hot VW's.
