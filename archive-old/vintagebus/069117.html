&gt; I have a set of 5 that is 2 or 3 years old.  It doesn't have a 17 mm,

&gt; Set 9-42170, &quot;5 Pc. Flat Ratchet Box Wrench Set - Metric&quot;, consisting of
&gt;  7 x  8 mm, 42171
&gt;  9 x 10 mm, 42172

No, I was referring to the reversable ratcheting box/open end wrench set
#42407 that has the toggle to switch ratcheting directions.  These
resemble the regular forged box/open end wrenches very closely with only
a little more thickness around the box end.  Very slick and nice to use.

The set contains 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18mm wrenches.  I have no idea
what 15 and 18mm wrenches are used for, except that the 15 is
used on the valves of Mexican type 1 engines where you don't want a
ratchet.  IIRC, the 17 and 19mm sizes were available on the rack at the
store.
