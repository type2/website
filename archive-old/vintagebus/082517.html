really love my bus, and all i can say is that i feel very bad about what 
happen, sorry John. Hope you find other SO-35 bus any time soon, i really 
do.

for sale CAVEOT EMPTOR Date: Thu, 23 Dec 2004 21:17:02 -0800

For all the points that might be made either way, the thing that bothers me 
is that a deal is a deal, and if I agreed to sell for a price and someone 
came along and told me I could have done better, I would still have to say I 
made a deal and honor it.

John
