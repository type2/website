Subject: Re: Chrome rear plate light??

&gt;I have replaced my license plate light 3 times now and it lasts a matter
&gt;of minutes each time. When I go to check it, the glass housing has a
&gt;very thin chrome-esque finish to it.

That's the tungsten that is evaporating off the filament.  Normally
this happens over the life of the bulb and by the time the filament is
done the bulb is almost all silvery on the inside.  Break the glass and
scrape the &quot;chrome&quot; - it's a very thin layer.  This is characteristic
of very small lamps that only have a vacuum.  Bigger lamps have an
inert gas fill that reduces the tungsten evaporation.  If you put a
little halogen gas in the inert gas, it will actually return the
evaporated tungsten to the filament, allowing you to run the filament
hotter and brighter.

&gt;The wiring harness is new and the ground wire appears to be firmly 
&gt;attached to the decklid.

Sounds like you have an overvoltage or bad bulbs.  If it was a system
overvoltage I think you'd notice every bulb on the Bus burning out,
and barring a really weird error in the new harness, I don't think
you have a local overvoltage at the license plate light.  A bad ground
would tend to reduce the voltage and current and make the bulb last
longer.

Make sure you're buying the right bulb that matches the voltage of
your system.  If that's in order, I agree with the &quot;bad batch of
cheap bulbs&quot; post.  Buy a bulb from a name-brand manufacturer like
Wagner, GE, Phillips, Sylvania, or Stanley and that _should_ fix
the problem.  If your FLAPS can't help, Wal-Mart carries GE bulbs
at good prices and NAPA carries Wagner ones.
