Your address has permanent fatal errors.

So I'll copy to the list.

The wire should feed if you are welding or not. I have found that mine is sensitive to the amount of bends in the hose from welder to work. So I have a 10' hose and keep my welder 9 or more feet from the work. Also if the welder is old (used) it may need a new liner.
