Well, here is the lowdown on my brake lockup situation.  I removed the 
splash pan and removed the bolts that hold the master cylinder on.  Looks 
like the P.O. recently replaced both the master cylinder and the flexible 
lines on the bus.  When I removed the bolts the master cylinder moved away 
from the pedal rod.  A little playing and it was evident that the rod was 
partially pushing the master cylinder piston in.  So, I really had a hard 
time cutting the rod so the bolts the PO used were long enough to put new 
washers between the mounting plate and the master cylinder. This moved the 
master cylinder away from the rod and was able to get the proper freeplay.  
Now when you take the cap off the reservoir and move the pedal you can see 
the fluid vent back into the reservoir when the pedal is released.  I put 
everything back together and went for a test drive.  Everything worked 
GREAT!!!!!!!

Only problem I have now is that the splash pan does not fit because the 
brake switch hits the pan and now does not fit on the bus.  Well, at least 
the brakes work now.

Thanks again for all the help from those on the list.  It definately saved 
me some diagnosing time!  Thanks again.
