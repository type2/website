Subject: RE: [VB] single port v dual port

OK, now I've got to go out and unload the shelf and check again for sure. I
know the DP set on my truck is 3/4&quot; long reach but since I don't have to
adjust the valves until next month I won't know their pedigree. The five sets
of SP and the single set of DP 917 on the shelf I will have to check for sure,
but I know the 917 heads are, just not sure who made those. The set of SP's I
have on the engine on the start up stand is 3/4&quot; but not sure of those either.
Well, I guess this will get me to check before I open my trap again.

I had &quot;assumed&quot; that my last mixed batch of heads out of the shop were all
genuine VW.

  There are 3 genuine VW duel port heads out there in the market place with
only the Mexican VW duel port with long reach plugs. OOPs also the 041
(39X32) so that really makes 4 genuine heads. Neither of the Brazilian OE
heads have long reach plugs. AutoLinia (aftermarket heads) also come with
3/4 reach plugs. There are no single port genuine heads I have ever seen
with long reach plugs,, even though they are a little beefier casting then
early single port heads.

ronnie

ps. In taking apert a few engine with long reach plug heads I have not
noticed the tell tale cracks as the non long reach ones.

pps. I also have a pile of OE single port heads with cracks between the
seats, not at the plugs. So single port crack just as duel port heads in my
observations

ppps. I have never seen a German head with long reach plugs
