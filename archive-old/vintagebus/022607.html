The [VB] is in memory of a lengendary bus figure in the Internet community,
who is missing, presumed dead, after secret spy photos discovered him in a
D*dge dealer's showroom, peering in the windows of double-door Voyagers
with child seats.  He was also seen carrying a small jar with two small
round objects in a liquid substance, being drug along, head down, by an
attractive woman who appeared to be early with child.  The new glue in said
vehicle reportedly incapacitated him to the point that he thinks he can
re-insulate wires, re-tread tires, and weld new material onto main bearings.
