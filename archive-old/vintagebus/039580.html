Isn't this beam higher than the one currently on the 66?  And if so will you 
be lowering it a little to correct for that?

&gt;
&gt;In a greater effort to enhance the braking power of my '66 I have decided 
&gt;to
&gt;attempt (notice the word attempt) to put a front beam from a '75 bus into a
&gt;'66 bus.  Apparently this is a fairly straight forward process, but want to
&gt;run through the steps with you all before I miss something huge.  I like 
&gt;the
&gt;idea of ball-joints, disc brakes, and dual chamber master cylinder...  My 
&gt;MC
&gt;is shot right now so it is a good excuse also to update instead of just
&gt;replace.
&gt;
&gt;There is some disagreement that the '75 front beam will attach into the 
&gt;four
&gt;17mm bolt holes on the '66 correctly.  I have seen many people on the list
&gt;claim success so I think it can be done.  If it is close the holes can
&gt;always be grinded out to fit if necessary, they have got to be somewhat
&gt;close to begin with.
&gt;
&gt;In random order here are the disassembly steps:
&gt;1.  Take speedo cable off.
&gt;2.  Disconnect the E-brake cables.
&gt;3.  Disconnect drag link.
&gt;4.  Disconnect some other link down there which should be obvious.
&gt;5.  Remove hard brake lines from the master cylinder.
&gt;6.  Remove the beam by removing the 4 bolts on each side.  Load on jack and
&gt;put in supports so I do not crush myself :)
&gt;6.  Remove MC
&gt;7.  Follow steps from Eric and Barb to trim the MC rod for the DC MC in 
&gt;Type
&gt;2 Library.
&gt;8.  Get brake fluid reservoir from a Rabbit (or a '67 good luck!).
&gt;
&gt;Assembly in semi-order:
&gt;1.  Put in new DC MC with adjusted rod.
&gt;2.  Connect rear brakes hard line into the MC.
&gt;3.  Put on the Rabbit fluid reservoir.
&gt;4.  Put beam in place and secure by the 8 bolts.
&gt;5.  Connect hard lines for the front brakes.  (Also check rubber lines,
&gt;pads, and rotors for condition)
&gt;6.  Reattach the drag link and other misc link.
&gt;7.  Connect and readjust E-brake cables.
&gt;8.  Connect speedo cable.
&gt;9.  Bleed the darn brakes again!!!  Arg!
&gt;10.  Go for a spin.
&gt;11.  Have a beer, relax, and let the wife complain at you how badly you 
&gt;just
&gt;wasted a weekend :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Also if I have the '75 rear brakes is there any updates I can do to the 
&gt;rear
&gt;brakes of my '66 while I am at it?  I hate adjusting those darn drums!
&gt;
&gt;A special thank you goes to John Baker for giving the '75 up for adoption 
&gt;in
&gt;the first place!  Thanks, it is being used to help save a '71 and upgrade a
&gt;'66!  Hopefully it can help others in the long run by more parts donations
&gt;for the needy busses.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;TIA!,
