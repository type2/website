Subject: MOFOCO Show

Anyone going to MOFOCO next weekend? I tried calling the number in the
magazine to get some info, but all I got was &quot;let's go racing, Racing,
RACING!&quot; for about five minutes. I need to know if you can bring pets to
the show/swap area; we want to bring our Lab with us, he wants to check
out the bikini show. 

	We're leaving from the St. Louis area, so we'll be looking for other
VW's going north. They had a pretty good swap area two years ago, so
we'll see what happens this year.

	By the way, what is a MOFOCO, gangsta-gibberish?
