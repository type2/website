Subject: M-code question

Matt and I both have 1960 DD panels here in Havasu, his was built 30,000
before mine. We both have M-code 360 (U S spec according to Thom's site),
but his has M-code 175 also (overrider bumpers) but mine doesn't and it came
with over rider bumpers. So the question is? Did VW include override bumpers
as a standard item in the late 60's as part of the U S spec package? or
could the over rider bumpers on mine just have been added later?  What were
the M-codes on the 2 60 DD's you found Thom?

Ronnie   inquirering minds need to know
