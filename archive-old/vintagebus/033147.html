&lt;&lt; Hey Everyone,
 
     My buddy's ignition switch died and needs to be replaced.  He's got a
 '67 bus and the catalogs list switches from '55-'66 only.  Is the '67
 *physically* a different beast all together from the other ones??  Would a
 '55-'66 switch fit the same??  Anyone?? Anyone??  TIA
  &gt;&gt;
ignition switch was physically the same 61-67, except the key profile was 
changed a couple times.   The 3/55 through 60 ones were originally screw 
terminal.  Anyway the ones sold as 55-66 yes will work in a 67 just fine, 
don't know why they didn't describe it as 55-67.


Clara
