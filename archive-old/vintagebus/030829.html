Speaking of 14's.  Are early bay bus 14&quot; rims the same as the late split 14's?
I did buy a set off a 70 out of a junk yard and they seemed to fit and look
correct, but I was in a hurry.

&gt; Just a weird thing that happened to me today. I went out to my junk piles of
&gt; wheels to find some 14 inch wheels, no problem I thought, I should have
&gt; stacks of them. After digging through all my wheels I came up with 1, 14&quot;
&gt; inch wheel, but found at least 3 complete sets of 15&quot; wheels, looks like
&gt; I'll have to start collecting 14 inch wheels again!
