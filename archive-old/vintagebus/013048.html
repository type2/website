After the great help of Richard Palmer and friends
this weekend my 67 now has an engine seal and all tin,
new wires, plugs etc.  Turned out my dist. was not
advancing so I bought an 009 from the Bus Depot, 
Thanks Ron!
I have put the 009 in and it does not have a vacum
hose so I have been told to plug that hole on the side
of the carb.  What should I plug it with.  Also
Richard's friend told me to plug the hole in the carb
that is facing me.  Sound right?  Next I plan to time
the van.  I have a timing gun but it does not have a
scale.  I marked the middle of the 3 notches on the
pully, I believe this to be approx. 8degrees.  How do
I test for total advance.  Do I have my wife rev the
engine while I watch the light.  Will the light now
blink at another 16 or so degrees off to the right for
a total of around 32degrees.  Then I will check the
idle and dwell but I have screwed up my meter by
playing w/the screw in the middle.  Anyone care to
tell me how to reset it.  Will make appropriate
changes tommorrow.  All that will be left is to
relocate the voltage regultor so I can put on the air
filter, fix it so high beams aren't on all the time
and hook up the horn.  Thanks very much!!!
