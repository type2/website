Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

The heat just seems to trickle out of the vents at best, front and rear.
The tube under the bus is there, and the insulation is trying to be there.
I'm going to insulate that better eventually.  All connections are good, and
the flaps are there, but the thermostat is not installed.  I've been
thinking of trying out an extra blower motor to improve the heat, has
anybody had any experience with these?

&gt; I have really good heat in my 65 westy.   the only problem I have is that
the
&gt; gas milage is getting crappy as these days it sits in the driveway warming
up
&gt; about as long as it takes me to drive to school.   Anyway, it does take a
few
&gt; minutes for the heat to get hot, but it does, as long as the outside temps
&gt; are above about 35 F.  If it's freezing outside, it still warms the bus
up,
&gt; but not as much.
&gt;
&gt; Does the heat blow a good blast of air?  I mean, do you have volume?
front
&gt; and back should be comparable.  You could insulate the heater boxes. is
the
&gt; insulation on the tube under the bus all there?  all connections good?
when
&gt; the heat is on are the flaps open all the way?
&gt;
&gt; thermostat installed?   That should make the bus warm up more quickly.
