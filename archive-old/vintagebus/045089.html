Subject: possible trade early SC gates for Bay SC gates
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a complete set of early bus single cab gates with rear latches that I 
will trade for 70 Bay window single cab gates and rear gate latches. My 
single cab gates are in good usable condition with slight rust at inside 
bottoms of the long gates. hinges are tight, the rear gate needs one hinge 
(included) welded back on but has no rust. All gates are straight not bowed. 
I just got a 70 single cab with no gates and I have these early gates. If 
your out of state then maybe we could meet half way.
