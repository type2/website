Okay, I'm not looking at the brake right now so I'll have to verify this 
after work.  The bar does seem a little loose when in the proper position, 
can maybe move 1/4 inch back and forth (maybe a little less) but when the 
brakes open it becomes very loose.  Loose enough in fact to slip out of its 
groove and lodge the brakes open.  I'll inspect the springs later today 
(after work when I have time to take em apart again).  I guess it's possible 
the springs are worn and not as tight as they should be.

PS:  My parking brake (ebrake?) is broken, has been for some time.  I think 
one of the mounting bolts to the lever mechanism (ie pull handle) up front 
has broken.  Being a slacker living in the flatlands of FLorida, this was not 
a priority problem so I let it slide and resorted to parking in first gear to 
keep from rolling.  The brake part is still intact, it's just never pulled 
tight.
