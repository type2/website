&lt;&lt; Too bad you did'nt make it to the 1st annunal OCTO (NEATO chapter in OC
 Cal.).  There was someone there with NOS interior panels.  If I remember
 correctly, the guy had some como green ones.   Anybody that went, know
 who that was?   The guy was driving a blue hightop bay window bus.   &gt;&gt;


I saw the guy at pomona today, said he still had some panels left, dunno what
( I dont know, he does), but he did say some of them were green.  His name is
Randy, he lives in Arroyo Grand, CA and his phone # is 805-481-0546.
