Ok, my test meter doesn't read amps, so I'm going by the sparking method
(carefully). The problem is, even with all fuses removed, I still get the
spark at the ground strap. The only way I've found to get rid of the spark
is by disconnecting the wire that runs from the starter to the front of the
bus (disconnect at the starter end). That's as far as I've got on this -
that wire looks about as hard to replace as the whole harness, so this may
be the route I take.

Thanks,
Wilder

I don't know about the backwards part, but try hooking up a VOM or
testlight between the battery and groundstrap, then start pulling fuses
till the current goes away. That will tell you where to look for the
fault...
