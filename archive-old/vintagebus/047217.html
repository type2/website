&lt;&lt; Hi,
 We are in need of an early (58down) rear bumper for our 1958 Deluxe in any
 condition - no trim OK. Please e-mail offers to vwboop_at_direct_dot_ca. Our
 insurance co. won't let us register our bus if it's missing major body parts
 (like a bumper) and we'd love to be driving it so your offers would be
 appreciated. Thanks. Chris &amp; Gina
 
 
 -------------- &gt;&gt;
you can attach a later bumper to the bus for driving until you find a stamped 
one.  a 68-71 bay window one would fit, as well as a 59-67 splitty one.
