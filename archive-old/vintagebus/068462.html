Subject: Re: [VB] California &quot;Pink&quot; slips

I believe in 1965 CA required a special permit for campers, or at least certification for campers converted in CA.  My 65 Sundial had a &quot;motorhome&quot; or some sort of tag on the pass. dogleg, right by the Sundial tag.  The only pre-64 buses I've seen with those tags, were converted to campers after 1965.  My 63 does not have one, or evidence of one being there.

Most states I've lived in (CA,NV,TX,MS,LA) trucks were cheaper to register than passenger cars.  They were not necessarily true &quot;commercial&quot; vehicles, but did have &quot;truck&quot; plates on them.  

I believe CA just considers them 'commercial' in the sense of their purpose, rather than a 'for hire' definition.

Isn't there a guy in thesamba_dot_com selling repops of the CA motorhome tags?

Another thing....I've only seen CA based camper conversions with those tags....no Westys that I can remember...so it must of been a manufacturing certification of some sort.

&gt; Don't know about over there, but here Campers with fixed interiors are
