With the Classic just a month away I'm trying to figure out a way to save a
buck.  First thought that comes to mind is drive my crewcab down and find a
place to camp.  Any of youz guyz that have been before know of camp sites or
camp friendly parking lots near the Classic?  Is anyone else planning on
camping out?  Hey Matt what are your plans?  Can't decide which bug to take?

Anyone from north of Lompoc going?  If so maybe we can hook up some place
and convoy.  As judge Mills would say &quot;LETS GET IT ON!&quot;  As Austin Powers
would say &quot;Yyyyeaa Baaaaabby!&quot;  ok ok ok ok  I'm done quoting.
