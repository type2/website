&gt;Is our beloved Vintagebus list dying?

The elbow may be barely breathin', but the heart of rock-n-roll is
still beatin'....

&gt;There seems to be less and less messages, very few road trip stories 
&gt;and there seems to be little if any good conflicts going on. Very 
&gt;little tech advice and questions seem to be few and far between.

It's the summertime...I think everyone is out driving around, going
on vacation, fixing their house, and such.  Most people (except
computer geeks like me) would rather be outside than in front of the
CRT.  I have also noticed fewer of the electrical tech questions
that I like to answer - I figure that lots of folks think that
fiddling with the wires is a chore that's best done on a rainy or
snowy day early in the year.  Get that safety sticker (for states
that require them) in the spring and you're good for another 1 to
2 years.  Also, in the summer, it's light out later so if your
electrical system is not 100% it's not quite as critical.

The server and archive outages earlier this year may have had
something to do with it, too.  I'd like to think that now that
the archives are back, more people are using them and finding
answers without posting.  Not that I don't want people to post
but we can only talk about tires and oil so much, ya know?

&gt;It's sad to see the bay window list out do us  and don't even
&gt;look at the Vanagon list, 200 plus a day.

The last of 1.85 million Splits came off the line nearly 34 years
ago.  The last of 2.4 million Bays came off the line about 22 years
ago.  The last of 1.3 million Vanagons is only about 11 years old.
The latest Eurovan is about 24 hours old right now.
