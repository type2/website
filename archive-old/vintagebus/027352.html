Subject: Adjustable Bay window Beam

My 57 23 Window came with a bay window ball joint front beam in it.
Depending on how much adjustability you have, you may use up your full
range just getting that beam down to stock splitty height. They sit
high. If you put on the beam to get better handling and then run skinny
tires you are probably going to lose any advantage you gained. I would
recommend getting some really good shocks all the way around, make sure
you have some really good tires and try that. That combination can make
an amazing difference. If you still need better handling check out some
of the sway bar upgrades. I have had a 61 Double Door panel that was
very low it did handle well but the ride was hideous. You shouldn't have
that problem with what you are talking about but I would watch the
width. What about having that beam narrowed? I wouldn't think that would
be too hard.
Hope this helps,
