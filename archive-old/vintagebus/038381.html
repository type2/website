Subject: Oval's show in Federal Way, Washington -- Sunday August 23
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 22:18:48 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

VW Show in Western Washington.
Sunday -- August 23.  Show runs 9:00am to 2:00pm.  Oval's Motorsports,
Federal Way, Washington.

Here is the advertisement they ran in the paper:  &quot;&quot;Free Volkswagen car show
&amp; swap meet. Oval's Motorsport, Sunday, August 23, 9am-2pm. (253) 874-8290&quot;&quot;
Their address is 1620 S. 341st Place, Federal Way.

This is the 7th or 8th year that Oval's has had the show... but they haven't
done the best job publicizing it.  Not a big show, but FREE and in a great
VW town.  Oval's is also one of the best VW FLAPS I have encountered in the
area... great to have a chance to shop their store on Sunday.  In past years
they do 10% store-wide for the show...

Listee Breakfast:  A few of us plan to meet near Seatac mall at 8:15am /
8:30am for breakfast.  P-mail me if you are interested.

Federal Way is right off of I5 about 1/2 way between Seattle and Tacoma.
You take the Seatac mall exit.

Not affiliated, just a fan of Oval's and wanting to catch-up with some
listees.
