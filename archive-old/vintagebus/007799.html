i know that everyones heard this before, but i was just informed
today that TMI (the one you all hate) has sucessfully completed
reproducing the platinum bus interior fabrics, and will have seat
covers and panels available for delivery by the end of december,
with como green next, then salt and pepper, then onto the
commercial fabrics, NO they are not going to do any of the westy
materials as of yet.

platinum samples were sent to me today to check out, so it looks
like we will have options for our buses, i don't know the quality of
the material but i do have tmi covers in a couple of my buses and
a lot of customers also, but if your building that mega dollar resto
you will probaly want to go with doug's as he has the reputation to
back his product.

ps. if all goes right i will have a complete TMI interior in my newly
aquired 66 hardtop deluxe walkthrough. (not the church bus)
