What is up with D*CK W*D parts duuds?
why do these guys have such lousy attitudes ?
Is it some kind of fume they are expose too that rots the 
human qualities that they once had an replaces it with
the personality traits of a carp with indigestion? Sheesh.
I call the local German parts salvage place and say, 
&quot;Hey, do you have a front wheel spacer for a '62 
microbus?&quot; and he says &quot; no, I only do complete front
ends, and I don't have any thing that old.&quot; I say (trying
to make a lighthearted attempt at sarcastic humor) 
&quot;what? old is where it's at man.. heh, heh,..&quot;
and he says &quot;Yeah, so I can sell spacers to losers
like you, it's my dream...&lt;click&gt;&quot; 

It must be quite  burden to be the big turd on the 
little pile of crud he calls a life.

Thank you all for indulging my Friday freakout.

Does anyone know where I can get a pair of
spacers for a '62 Microbus?
