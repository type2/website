 I guess that means that unless someone gets all flakey and GIVES(like hell)
 me a pair my new bus will wear the spare set from my '60 doublecab. The deck
 on the kombi must be wrong cos it doesn't have the centre brake light or
 holes where it was.

what is your new buses vin?   if you have a bus about vin 246xxx to 351xxx, 
it camw with a flat decklid  (like brakelight decklid but no brakelight 
there, but not got the hump the later ones did)  with the round glass 
taillights with separate bezel and screws on outside.   sounds like you have 
the flat decklid.
