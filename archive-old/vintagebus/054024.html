Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen Crew Cab - Orange County CA.

Yah i slapped it up on the front page of my site a few days ago. I figure
the sooner and more noticeable to everyone, the better. Another week and it
will prolly be gone for good unfortunately or at least painted a different
color.  from Randy: &quot;I got a tip that it was seen at Orangethorpe and Lemon
(near EMPI) in Anaheim.&quot;
Shows how dumb thieves are if the guy is drivin it around with the same
paint scheme.
I figure the internet should make it easier to catch stolen buses, or at
least I hope so. Did he send out an old picture tho? I can't make out the
safaris..

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Just had someone send me an email about a stolen Crew Cab in Orange County.
&gt;It's got a camoflauge paint scheme and safari's, so it shouldn't be THAT
&gt;hard to spot.
