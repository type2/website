I have a '59 23w that has such severe roof rust that, I am going to put new

metal in to cover the missing metal (the lower 2/3 of the skylights)



15 window Deluxe Sunroof!   anybody else have one?


- - -  - -
have you looked for a donor for metal for repairing the skylight windows?
If you can't find one, I know of a 21 window top which has been used for that
purpose (as the bus it was on was thrashed, and it had some rust up top too),
and may be able to help you out.
