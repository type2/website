Subject: Re: [VB] Now for something completely different

Yeah, I've got a set of snap ring pliers but they have narrow little pins to
engage the holes in little snap rings. I'm afraid those little pins are
going to snap off if I try to use them on such a hefty snap ring.

That duckbill thing is what I'm talking about. You need something like that
to handle the square ends of that snap ring. You wanna sell me yours? I'll
give you a buck.

Kevin, now you're embarrassing us. Doesn't everyone already have a set of
internal snap ring pliers? Just kidding.

I bought mine at a local tool distributor about 28 years ago and they still
work great. I have seen them at really good FLAPS, not Schucks! They have
kind of a of a 3/16 square duckbill end on them and you squeeze them to open
them up.
