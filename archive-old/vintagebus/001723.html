One of my personal favourite web sites is http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com
There are some absolutely funny tales on this site as well as some neat
info.  A this page http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm there is some
excellent info on doing a conversion using twin 6 volt batteries.  What I
found most interesting was the wiper motor conversion. Using a late model
wiper assembly from a bay window bus, and then using a super beetle motor,
you can convert a splittie wiper assembly to 12v for less than the cost of
JCW's voltage reducer.  (assuming the use of junkyard parts however.)

Guess that's it for now.
