&lt;&lt; Had anyone noticed a significant degredation in performance when travelling
 with a roof rack? &gt;&gt;

Thom,

I drive with roof rack(s) filled with all kinds of stuff (firewood, extra 
propane, kindling, my BBQ pit) and you're right!  There's all kinds of 
degradation of performance when driving with any kind of headwind, but come 
to my fire pit at Christmas Tree Island this weekend and tell me it's not 
worth it, and I'll pay your gas back north to balance John Howard's offer, 
but you have to camp with us.  None of this &quot;I have a friend in the area&quot; 
stuff!  Look for my '59 Grey over Sealing Wax Red subhatch camper and bring 
your gas receipts.

See you this weekend (getting up at 5:30 tomorrow) - next stop --&gt; Havasu

JP
