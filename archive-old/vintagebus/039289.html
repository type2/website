Joseph Kittinger, former Air Force Captain and test pilot, tested space
suits 
before there were space ships by jumping out of helium balloons.
He jumped at 102,800 ft (20 miles) in 1960 with 400 mile visibility in
every direction.  
The upper stratosphere is in a vacuum, perfect for testing space suits.

One free fall lasted 4 minutes, accelerating to 714 mph,
past the sound barrier.  His total 'flight' lasted 13 minutes 45
seconds.

I think his motto of the 50's applies to VW busses today:

''First, know your abilities and don't overestimate yourself.
Second, know the capability of the equipment you are using 
and don't demand more than it can give you in service and performance.
Third, don't become complacent.
