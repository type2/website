&lt;&lt;Hi there,

I just subscribed to this list as I just bought my first vintage bus.  I do 
have a 63 beetle but never a bus.  I just purchased a 59 Kombi.  I have a 
few questions:

1-is it common to have sliding windows between the front passenger area and 
the back cargo area?&gt;&gt;


VERY common if you got an AMBULANCE.
Not too common for a Kombi bus.
I think you need to tear these out and sell them to me. ;-)
