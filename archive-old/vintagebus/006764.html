Got a couple of leads on some buses Friday, so headed out to check them out,
1 was a VWHorward lead so I went with him to check it out, but will let him
tell you about it, the others were a couple of leads I got, so we went to
check one of them out. It was pretty interesting though, we found a guy who
has some BUSES among other misc. 40'S, 50's and many other cars and trucks.
After talking to this person for a while (a very hardnosed) he warmed up to
VWHoward and I and decided to show us at least one of the buses, the
problems being that the weeds and brush have totally taken his yard over)
walking down we saw 1 of the BUSES it was a 62-63 Sundial camper, could only
see the left front because of the growth but it appeared pretty decent, we
asked about the others and he said he had another camper like the one we
just looked at, but couldn't find it because of the growth. Then he
proceeded to tell us about another bus he has way back in the jungle that he
had bought way back when at an auction, and being way in the back it had to
of been a long time ago, this owner of the yard had been there 30 years or
so, anyway he proceeded to tell us about this bus that's from the early 50's
with all those funny windows around the top, dooh!! could it be another
BARNDOOR  DELUXE, only time will tell as the yard owner has to start
removing all the growth due to the city annexing the property and promised
to call when all are visible.

http://www.type2parts_dot_com       check out the new look (best with IE 5.0 or
better)

ps. for those that care, my 61 side loader single cab was picked up today,
an interesting story is that the people I bought it from were the second
owners who had purchased it from the original owner in 1971! who bought it
to haul his daughters pony around in and this was there family vehicle and
daily driver for 10 years till the people I bought it from got it and had
been parked in a barn since then and not driven, I can't wait to get it here
to see the mileage on the speedo, the PO told me it's original and low but
couldn't remember. Another interesting tidbit, the PO'o took it for a drive
to make sure everything was working properly and told me that the only
problem they had was 1 axle seal leaking! and that it probably could use new
tires being the ones on it were new over 20 years ago and they wouldn't
trust them after that long.
 Also the 57 single cab that I bought from fellow listy Rex Rogers is also
being picked up and delivered to me, the cool part is that Rex will get to
see the side loader before me.
