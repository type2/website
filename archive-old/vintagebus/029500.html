I wanted to thank the quick respondents on this issue and summarize
suggestions:

1) borrow/obtain an oil pressure gauge to get actual readings (I have
one on my '71 that I'll borrow)

2) check the oil pressure relief spring for length &amp; tension (and
perhaps replace with an HD version?)

3) use thicker oil (I'm thinking straight 40 weight - this is Florida)

4) jack up idle to keep the light off (certainly workable if this isn't
a daily driver)

Thanks, folks!

condensed version of original post:
&gt; 
&gt; Carb was dumping gas into engine for an undetermined amount of time (I
&gt; just bought it) - black plugs and lots of gas in the oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Oil light takes a few seconds to go out after starting and comes on at
&gt; normal idle.  Sometimes comes on almost as soon as I take my foot off
&gt; the gas.  Revving to est. 1500 RPM makes it go out.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering if a &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump might keep me from having to
&gt; tear down the engine.  It's not my daily driver -- I'd like to keep it
&gt; runnable for once or twice a week pleasure trips around town.
