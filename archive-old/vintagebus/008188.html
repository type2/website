Subject: 40hp muffler ?

ok I need a muffler and I got one, it looks like a 40hp muffler but it does
not fit why? (just to describe it a little) my muffler the old one that is,
both the heat risers are connected to the upper exhaust with the left one
has a little tube that comes up and connects to the heat riser that is
connected to the upper exhaust . On the muffler I got the left heat riser is
not connected to the exhaust manifold the little tube has the heat riser
connected to it. but that is not the problem it is the bottom two exhaust
connectors are not long enough - huh I don't know - does anyone know what I
am talking about - just need a muffler and I can drive!
