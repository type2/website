Subject: My 56 Lives Again

howdy. after about a month of working my 
&quot;new&quot; bus like a crazy person, i have got my recently acquired 56 
(wolfsburg built) standard back on the road. many thanks to all involved with 
transportation from new mexico to central california (JP Henriksen), parts 
(Foreign Aide, Ronnie, Rick Clark, and anyone else i forgot....), and especially 
Rachel for putting up with my frustrations when i was armpit deep in grease and 
she wanted to talk.

i got the bus out here the weekend before labor day, and 
then my parents were here for a visit, so for the first couple weeks i didn't 
get too much done to it. but i got a complete split case bus tranny at 
sacramento bug-o-rama for $20 and it seems to work great so far. i completely 
rebuilt, cleaned, and painted the front end drum to drum, installed the unknown 
tranny after completely rebuilding, cleaning and painting the axle tubes and 
reduction boxes, hell, i even disassembled the axle tubes/reduction boxes and 
put on NOS one piece axle boots and replaced the spring plate bushings! all new 
brakes cylinders and a FAG master cylinder were installed. even put an 
original aluminum brake fluid reservoir on the new master. i removed, cleaned, 
and greased the original brake cables. and the fun part was removing, cleaning, 
and re-greasing all the pedals and bushings up front. it's amazing what sitting 
in the desert for 30 years will do as far as collecting gobs of dirt in the 
tiniest places, and how nice and free parts move after being cleaned and greased 
again!

FOR NOW i have a 1600 dual port in it. ONLY because i do 
not have a 36 ready to install. i am actually thinking of putting a big-bore 
40hp in it, but the exhaust may not fit under the ribbed rear bumper, so that is 
yet to be determined. anyway, the dp runs good and propels the split case 
trannied bus well, so i can't complain other than it looks stupid in that early 
bus engine bay. for those purists, i put a 6V flywheel on the engine so no metal 
was removed from the bell housing, and i cut the dp engine tin to conform to the 
smaller curvature of the front firewall (yeah, like i'd cut the bus metal ;P 
).

Rachel and i took it for its preliminary test drive this 
afternoon, and all went well except for the drag link needing adjustment so the 
steering wheel is straight and the brakes needing their post-run-in adjustment, 
everything went great. tranny works good, brakes do too, and the engine runs 
darn good. 

i must also thank Bob at wiring works for specially making 
the new wiring harness. fits great and now i think he'll have a model for US 
brake light decklid busses to make them off of, so if you have one of those 
busses, now might be a good time to contact him about making more. he also 
rushed it so i'd get it in time to have it installed by the weekend, and i 
appreciate that alot too. it went in so smoothly it only took about 2 hours 
total to install the entire thing.

so, i plan to get legal this week with the state and drive 
to octo this weekend coming up. it'll be my first trip in a split case, brake 
light decklid bus, and the first trip this bus has seen in about 30 years. 
can't wait! so if you make it to octo, look for the bus with blue bullet turn 
signal housings, a smashed up nose, a grey front bumper (a $20 puyallup score), 
giant key logos on the side (although they are a bit burned off from the desert 
sun), and a few spots of original paint peeking out from under the sandy 
yellowish paint. unfortunately i don't have a digital camera at this time, 
so pics will have to be later. i will say that under the layer of paint that it 
has on it from x amount of years ago and under the old locksmith logos on the 
sides, there is original palm green/sand green paint, which i am trying to save 
by wet sanding the layer over it.
