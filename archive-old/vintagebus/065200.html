&gt; ...watching the ground rise around me when I made my

&gt; Canyon.  A good substitute is Yosemite National Park.  Same as the canyon,
&gt; but It's GREEN.

If you're going this route go across northern Arizona at the Vermillion
Cliffs and go to the north rim of the Grand Canyon.  I don't see Yosemite
as a substitute for the Grand Canyon.  You trade awesome for crowded.
Don't discount the state parks in the West.  Many of them are just as
spectacular as the national parks and much less crowded.

&gt; I wanted to make it to all the different canyons, and high stuff in Utah,
&gt; but my bus wasn't liking the Altitude.  Are you taking a bus?

Buses shouldn't have problems with altitude.  They just run a bit slower.
I've taken my low-compression 1600 bus over 12,000 foot passes with no
problem.  All it takes is gears.
