Hello every one this post is a bit long so bear with me ok ?
I wanted to respond and thank everyone for the kind words and the 
encouragement. We all here try hard to do these units as if the were our own, 
and take pride in our work, at times we are very anal about it , the good 
responses are very welcome, i pass all the compliments on to the guys in the 
shop also. To me that gives them the incentive to do their best for you. They 
are as offended as i am by some of the butchery we get in here thats has been 
coated with layers upon layers of bondo and such. Tony and Mark both are very 
good and also take great pride in what we do here. 
To Tom Mink ,thank you for your kind words very much ,coming from some of 
your stature it is a great compliment, but  i doubt if the world is ready for 
2 redneck A**holes like me,(grin). 
To address the parts comment by Steve Harris, If we can get moved into a 
bigger shop soon they will become more avalible , if you need something yell, 
if i can fab it its yours as long as you give me some leavway in a time frame 
to get them made up, i hope to get a list of all we have going as fabbed 
parts by the first of the year, and be ready to roll with them as well as our 
other rustoration projects. Thanks Kelly 
ps i'm ccing this to Mark and Tony also , if you want to e-mail them directly 
feel free to do so
