Just to set the record straight...YES, I am a newbie, but I DID NOT
write to Bob Hoover to ask some dumb question that I could have found
out on my own.  I wrote to compliment him on his knowledge, to show
agreement with his philosophy on correct original restorations, and to
side with him about not assuming just anyone can take an antique
vehicle on road trips.  I guess that because I threw in a little joke
assuming that it was okay to drive 3 miles at 35 mph daily (so are you
guys in agreement that I have to garage this thing now that I've spent
the bucks to own it and get it in great running order?), he decided to
make me feel dumb, nevermind he could have been a little more pleasant
since my MAIN focus was praise of his expertise.  Is a little humanity
now too much to ask for?  NO MORE HOOVER THREAD!!! PLEASE!!!
