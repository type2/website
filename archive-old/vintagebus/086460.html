Subject: Bus dies at stop lights

Howdy Volks,
Always enjoy reading the posts on this list. I just picked up a '65
Westfalia, so-42, albeit with some bits and pieces missing. It has a dp 1600
installed, 009 dist, 30pict carb, and seemed to be running fine in my shop
at home. 

So I take it out for the maiden voyage to work today and for the Texas
Safety inspection at lunch and now it stalls everytime I come up to a stop
sign or red light. It just slowly dies. It fires right back up but this is a
bit unnerving nonetheless.

My quick guess is that the elec choke might be killing it maybe? The idle
does not seem too low really.

Any words of wisdom would be mucho appreciated,
Thanks
Gary
Round Rock, TX
