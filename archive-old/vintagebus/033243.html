Hi NQ,
Carbs are well just carbs and act and have pretty much the same basic parts.  
Best to install a really small main jet or a large jet that has been soldered 
shut and then experiement with the pilot jet and pilot jet air bleed till the 
idle speed adjusting screw, and the idle mixture screw work like they should 
at idle.  Then try out differant sizes of smaller main jets till you get a 
hesitation going from idle into the lower RPMs.  When this happens just go up 
a size or two to where you have plenty of power and no hesitation going up 
off from idle.  Then experiment with bigger and bigger sized air correction 
jets until you get a loss of HP at high RPMs (about 2,500 - 3,000 RPM) from 
being too lean.  Just go back down one or two sizes of air correction jet to 
get the right mixture.
In other words. 
Pilot jets make the idle function.

Accelerator pumps/injectors add just a tad of fuel to get the engine to 
smoothly off idle and in some of the later stock and many of the aftermarket 
carbs have to be adjusted for just the right injection amount to avoid being 
too lean or rich of mixture during this time.

Main jets go to work just off from idle and on up through the RPMs.

Air correction jets allow more air into the mixture at higher RPMs to avoid 
the mixture from getting way too rich!  Eric&amp;Barb
