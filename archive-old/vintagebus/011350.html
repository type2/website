Friday, June 12, 1998:
My wife and I had been preparing for the annual trip to Mecca for what
seemed like weeks. Our average sleep was a lovely four to five hours.
Limitations on available vacation hours obligated us both to working half of
Friday. Our plan was to be able to run home jump in the bus and zoom out of
Phoenix toward California. Poor Everett Barnes attempted to meet up with the
caravan of whacko who, in the past, tend to leave early on Friday morning
before the desert heat pounces.  Apparently that crowd didn't exist this
year thereby leaving Ev the Barn in a lurch. He attempted to hook up with us
but my head was swimming due to running so far behind schedule. I encouraged
his to start out with out us in his 36hp Barn-door. Of course we'd catch up
to him. We never did. Sorry about that Everett.
We finally left at Four PM directly into very unusually strong winds and the
setting sun.
I was rather grumpy and doubtful of the virtues of towing the Puck trailer
all the way to the shows and back. At 45MPH in the commuter lane and running
at 230F did not improve my attitude. I swore that I was going to make this
marriage last so I pushed on.  My attitude and the oil temp cooled about
thirty degrees by the time that we reached the relative flat plains of the
desert. A car load of young water-cooled VW lovers lifted our attitudes by
screaming by us at a zillion miles an hour, jamming on their brakes,
lowering the electric windows, snapping photos and screaming obscene
encouragement in favor of our flying circus and then disappearing into the
horizon. We continued on at our Puck pulling 45-62 MPH.
The Puck caravan actually towed great once up to speed. I was real grateful
for the gauges, full-flow and the cooling fan.
Gradually, we rolled past Palm Desert and opted for the Riverside &quot;short
cut.&quot; After many minor mis-navigations we arrived in the Holiday Inn parking
lot at 01:00 AM.

Saturday, June 13, 1998:
After four whole refreshing hours of sleep we were up and rolling toward the
SOTO meet. Minor adjustments in logistics and acquired experience over the
years seemed to expedite everyone's entry into the meet. The word &quot;Cluster&quot;
can be kept in the can for this year. Last year Paula and I spent a lot of
time setting up the then freshly restored camper. The sour grapes in me made
me think that the elusive deals of the century slipped through my hands.
Probably not but you know what I mean... Last year was a non-judged event.
This year my plan included blowing off the posturing B.S. and going for the
stash. The weird thing was that I wasn't looking for anything in particular
and the budget was in check. A few minor treats were located and I took
turns running around and baby sitting the bus/trailer combo.

The Puck caravan was a surprise crowd pleaser! Paula says that the
percentage of females willing to inspect and a converse with her climbed
like Microsoft stock in the 1980's. (Damn, I should have bought when it was
$15 per share). The operative word for the Puck was &quot;cute.&quot;  That's the
cutest darned thing that I ever did see, That's at cute trailer, That
trailer is cute as hell...  Like most guys,  I embrace the word &quot;cute&quot; like
the dreaded bend over and cough exam.

OK, I'm guilty of giving SOTO praise. Crucify me. The show was great, the
T-shirts always kick ass and word  has it that the new and improved
newsletter will actually be produced and be distributed on a monthly basis.
I will report appropriately.
It was a cool show with tons of buses and a great swap. I opted not to buy
any raffle tickets but roved up to here the award presentation. Next thing I
know, I'm being hustled up to the front of the crowd. Unexpectedly, we had
won First Place in the camper class! WOW! I mean, this is the show of the
infamous imaginary vintage Nazis and we were in the company of Ross Harmon's
1HIPBUS and 2HIPBUS. Rick and Susan Crandall's converto Dormobile SO-44 is
no slouch either! And there is that guy Larry's (and his blue eyed wife's)
beautiful Gulf Blue and Cloud White real Dormie which was purchased from the
original owners. In my opinion, that blue and white Dormie is a totally
overlooked bus. Nice one Larry! Not to belittle ourselves we are proud of
the bus and our trophy. Thanks to SOTO on that one.

Charlie Hammill and Sherilyn's Cinebus was big draw, Mike Hornbecker had his
wares there, Mark Smith, Rex Eastman both had new inventories of T-Shirts
etc. Tons of vehicles and swappers were everywhere. Another trailer was in
the show area. It was a cool vintage wooden popup trailer that was obtained
for the right price the previous day. The SOTO show ended and we went back
to the Irvine Holiday Inn and watched the parking lot scene from a perch on
top of the parking deck. It was rumored that a few of us had a good time and
a few &quot;pops&quot; up there. Of course no one ever camps in the parking lot.

The Classic! =) I have been lucky to have made it to this one for many
years. This one was so over whelming that I went away feeling like I didn't
see it. The car show was packed on both the Vintage and the Custom sides.
The swap was in an over flow mode. Major displays of Barn doors and New Beetles.
It struck me that the New Beetle is becoming a major market for  the
after-marketeers. Parts is Parts and others had a big presence. VWOA was
very much in attendance.
One item that Bill Bowman *NEATO* president and I discovered was a product
called &quot;The Breezer.&quot; (TM) Patent, Rollin' Relics, 1998.  The goal of this
ingenius  device is to assist in the redirection of the air emitting from
the overhead fresh air ducting. Being the 5' 10&quot; guy that I am, the air
tends to blow right over my head. During the trip to the Classic I commented
that someone ought to create a device to regulate this flow. I have had an
idea but have not acted up on it. Driving a splitty in Phoenix demands that
you get all of the direct airflow that is possible.
Professionally made out of metal, the vent is marketed in pairs and is
similar in appearance to the thingus that you can place over the vent
registers of your home HVAC system. The Breezer installs easily by removing
the single Phillips screw from your bus' overhead vent. Insert the tab part
of the product into the fwd end of the vent (either side), align the hole in
the other end with the screw hole. Replace the screw and you are done. No
holes or alteration to your bus is required! Contact George Davis at (707)
995-2480 or NOTCH65_at_AOL.COM for more info. The test drive home was pretty
favorable. Paula chose not to have one on her side. No problem, she removed
it herself as we dragged north on the 57 freeway. Everyone was happy.
Awards at the Classic:
Tons and tons of every type of Volkswagen were there! I seriously didn't
even see most of the Vintage area and failed to get over to the Custom side
all together.  We snagged Second Place behind Blue Nelson's nice crowd
pleasing Dormobile. Nice job Blue! It was nice to once again be amongst such
nice company. I think next year I might drive the rat '63 EZ camper and lock
it up and see more of the show... Unless I pull something else from up my
sleeve. =)))))))))))))

This year we passed on the usual Monday as the drive home. The same high
wind that inhibited our progress toward California tended to sweep us back
home. The Puck continued to tow invisibly excepting the steepest of hills.
Caravaned with our friends from Phoenix and finally arrived in Phoenix at
01:00. We are talking real sleepy here! Dragged butt into the job by 07:00
8=(  Slept like a corpse Monday night.

The Classic Weekend was a gas! Thanks to SOTO and Periscope Enterprises for
all of the effort. It was great seeing all of our buddies and meeting new
ones. We can't wait to meet even more at the Cascade Kombi/NW Vintage
Weekend in July. See you there!
