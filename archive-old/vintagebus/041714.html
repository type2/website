Hey now, i represent that remark!

I'm driving an 85 Quantum (woo. 120+hp..) thanks to John Anderson....why?
Because it was free, and my bus has been head and transmissionless since
mid-february....

&gt; Have we moved into a new era where busses are for shows and garages and
&gt; other cars are for driving?

Well, had i known it was going to take this long, i'd have built a garage
around the bus...hrmph.
