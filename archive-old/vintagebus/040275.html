Crap - I just re-read the rules and saw by posting that I disqualified 
myself by talking about it.  Oh well, I'll enjoy watching the posts come 
through!

With luck maybe Ellis won't see your post and you can sneak it by him. 
Either that or sign up for a freebie Hotmail account and go with a 
pseudonym. Either that or a fake name. ;-)
I think I heard Ellis say that this was going to be a crooked and corrupted 
game. Bribery works wonders with him. Dont tell anyone but I hear that he's 
really a softie.
