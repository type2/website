NOS will be *really* hard to find.  Do you have &quot;tall&quot; or
&quot;short&quot; doglegs now.

&gt; -singlecab rockers, both sides,

You can use a &quot;normal&quot; rocker - http://www.vintagebus_dot_com

&gt; -rear apron

Should be easy to find.

&gt; -driverside door, Must have good hinges and be rot
&gt; free
&gt; -engine lid

Shouldn't be too difficult. 

&gt; - mirrors with arms , prefer &quot;elephant ears&quot; 

Beware of the repros; there are varying grades of quality.

&gt; - lower part of the rear corners

Oooh - a toughie!

&gt; I saw that the repro doglegs are for 63-67 . is there
&gt; any wat to make these fit like 62 and earlier? 

Kelly (metwiz) makes pieces that you section in, if you need tall
doglegs.  Otherwise you could use them as is.  I have a pair of
the repro doglegs, and one problem I notice - at least with the ones I have - 
is they are not &quot;square&quot;  - the build quality is AWFUL.  I would need to
drill out the spot welds and re-assemble them.  They're *THAT* bad!

&gt; How hard is it to modify the bus rocker to fit a
&gt; single caB? can I just switch the lock base thats on
&gt; the rocker itself?

See my howto page.

&gt; Is the lower part of the rear corners the same as the
&gt; truck ? All I nees is a little below the tail lights
&gt; around the battery pan area.

It's different, but with some creative metal work, could be patched.
