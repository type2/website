Subject: Re: [VB] 1965 VW Bus Question

mid 64-66 front door handles are interchangable and use the same key.
The front door handles used through mid 64 have the pull handle (aka old fridge handle) and don't fit the later doors.
1967 handles fit, but the key is different, you can't get it re-keyed to the same key.

Are your different keys the same shape where they go into the locks??? If they are the same shape there, the locks can be re-keyed to one key.? If they aren't, then?some handle?has been replaced from a different year bus.



........................................................:
&gt;By way of an introduction, I am a new owner of a 1965 Bus.

WOLFSBURG WEST. i too have a bus with original handles, each one  having its own separate key. one day I must DO SOMETHING about this. 
 there is also BFY. all is not lost!  Oh the key to the back  door is also different, but i do have the original ignition key.
