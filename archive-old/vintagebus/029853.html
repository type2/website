Subject: manuals 

Well..as my subject indicates I need some advice on manuals for my bus. 
I am very new to the VW scene, and have recently purchased a 60 dbl
door.  I've had some help working on it, and need to get a good manual,
or perhaps even manuals.  Where is the best place to get one.  Also, I
suppose this question will probably be answered when I get my manual but
where is the reserve tank switch???  My father owned a bug from around
the same time and he says that when he ran out of gas, he had a switch
that gave him reserve fuel.  is there one on my bus????  is it possible
to put in a fuel guage??  be easy on me, I'm learning here!!! I'd
appreciate any advice.
Thanks
Kevin
