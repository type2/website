Folks,
I have an import ticket for my bus which stated the chassis number as 
258459, I'm not sure that this is right, as I can't check it against the 
bus (it's in the shop)
Looking at Thom's FAQ, this would make it a (25) Sondermodell (Special 
Model, 7-seater)
Manufactured in 1958 (8), the bus has semaphores, weren't these dropped for 
'58 ?
Also, shouldn't the chassis number be 9 digits ?
Yours, confused,

Damon.
