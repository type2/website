&gt;I recently un-lowered my double cab.  The front was

&gt;installed and engine this weekend and drove it around (whohoo!)
&gt;
&gt;The only thing I can think of is that I need to give the
&gt;new front springs time to 'settle'.  I can't think of any
&gt;other reason for the high front end/low back end.

When I first got my DC, it sat somewhat low and I checked the adjustment 
ala bentley also.  Got the degreed level out and went to town.  It still 
seemed to sit somewhat low.  I think I went back and added one or two 
&quot;clicks&quot; and was happy with it.
It seemed weird since I would almost expect it to sit higher since there is 
less metal back there compared to a bus.

I did come across a lowering web page once where they were messing with the 
rear torsion bars.  I vaguely remember something about heating the bars or 
something to allow them to droop more.  I also wonder if with age, these 
bars develop a slight twist to them?
