well you were a little late on the drilling advice, as obsessive as i am
about getting my bus back into shape( after 10 years of driving other cars)
i was on it at the crack of dawn,  i snapped the one on the driverside, just
to get things goin, then i was able to pound it out using a 16penny nail,
that was easy, then i had to remove the hinge from the body , which was a
real pain , i had to drill 2 of the screws out and then &quot;borrow&quot; a couple of
screws from the stiker plate on my 79 westfailing, anyway the drill got a
little of center on me, of course i started with a small bit and worked my
way up to a 5/16, the part on the door drilled out nice, but the hole in the
hinge half from the body was a little corrked, but i reinstalled it and
reemed it a couple of times with the 5/16 bit, and stuck in the mirror, and
ther it was, and well ill have to say that the door actually works way
better than before,

but as far as these elephant ear mirrors that i bought, ill have to say
after i got them on and looked at them well, they seem preety crappy for the
price, the seal is very loose, very rust prone the way the seal is and the
screw/ball attachment adjuster thing on the mirrow, cheap looking part, why
do these cost $30 each , i dont understand. but anyway now i can see the
suprise on peoples faces as i go blowin by in the old 66,    has anyone had
these elephant ear mirrors for a long time? do they hold up? should i buy
another pair for my golden years?

&gt; &lt;&lt; have you guys ever read that part in the bently manual about removing
the
&gt;  side view mirror arm from the door hinge?  It says to work it to and fro,
&gt;  well mine snapped like the neck of a spring chicken! ill be outside
drilling
&gt;  if anybody needs me

&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; keep in mind that when that book was written these were fairly new cars.
&gt;
&gt; I use lots of penetrating oil, and unscrewing the nut so it his flush with
&gt; the bottom of the stem I tap up.   use vise grip to wiggle it.  yes can be
a
&gt; PITA.  be careful when drilling not to waller out the hinges so as to not
get
&gt; sloppy door syndrome.
