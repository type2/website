Subject: Re: [VB] Mounting a Spare on the front...

Well, my primary objective was to scare people into thinking
I was putting one of those spare tire mounts on a bus!  In
real life, that's the faux Westfalia trailer I'm building.  It
even has real VW spindles and wheels.

Here it is with the bus

And the entire suite of pix:

&gt; &gt; Fellow Listee Joel Bidinger came by today and delivered
&gt; &gt; a spare tire mount for me today, and I wasted no time in
&gt; &gt; getting that puppy welded on (bolting just wasn't good
&gt; &gt; enough).  Some people think a spare tire on the front is
&gt; &gt; hideous, but I *like* it.
