Hi Ronnie,
VW since the mid 1950s has always wanted the front brakes to lock up way 
before the rear tires.  This allows the rear tires to keep turning which in a 
way keeps the rear steering the VW staight when the fronts are locked up, 
while the rear brakes slowing the bus keeps the bus nose facing forward.  
Otherwise you can expect a 180 or even 360 after 360 degree spin.  Much like 
driving a VW with only two studded snow tires only on the rear axle.  Which 
is alot better than having them in the front and having the rear non-studed 
snow tires lock up allowing the rear of the VW to spin you around easily on 
ice and compacted snow!  This can also be tested by just running normal 
non-snow non-studed tires in icy conditions and giving just the E-brake a 
yank!  Before 1955 VW made the brakes the drums same width/diameter, same 
piston/cylinder diameter on the front and rear axles of thier bus and bug 
models.  The bus brake designers even went one step further to do up the 
front brake shoes with two slave cylinders per front wheel which pushes the 
brake shoes into the forward rotation of the drums making them even more 
effective!

  As for the disc brake 1970 buses the discs apparently take about twice the 
PSI to lock up as the rear drum brakes.  Which would make the rear brakes 
lock up before the front ones.  So VW came out with a brake pressure 
regulator that when the bus decelerates this pressure regulator will only 
allow about 800 PSI to the rear brakes, while the front disc brakes get about 
1420 PSI.  To test the brake pressure regulator in the bus you actually have 
to unbolt it from the body and tilt it forward end down 30 degrees apparently 
to simulate deceleration (As found in Bentley service manual for 1968-79 bus, 
section 8, pages 11-13, proceedure 5.1 &amp; 5.2.).  Otherwise when the brake 
pressure regulator is mounted properly on the bus body on flat ground this 
test shows equal amounts of brake pressure in the front and rear brake 
system!  So there is no proportioning of the brake pressure due to the master 
cylinder, only the brake pressure regulator.

      Quote from the Bentley 1968-79 bus, section 8, page 11, proceedure 5, 
&quot;On 71 and later models-those with front disc brakes and a vacuum powered 
brake servo-there is a pressure regulator in the rear brake circuit that 
prevents the rear brakes from locking when they are used to thier maximum.  
This insures that braking effort is correctly between the front and rear 
wheels.

  We took time in our research to make sure also that the 1955-66, 67 only, 
1968-70, and 1971-79 MCs have the same diameter pistons/bores in them.  The 
only big differance between the 1971-79 MC and the 1955-70 MC is that the 
later MC is designed for installation into the vacuum brake booster.
  We are not saying VW design was always perfect, but in the 1955-79 ACVWs 
the brakes were designed with this bias for stonger and thusly more likely to 
lock up first front brakes in there bus, bug, KG, type 3s, and things.
