Just a few quick words about BBB IV....

Even though we got on the road 5 hours later than planned (due to waiting for 
someone to either fix a tranny in one bus or put a motor in another), we 
still got to BBB Friday night and had a blast.  Special thanks go out to Dan 
Howard for stopping with his emergency flashers on with us when we kept 
blowing fuses...we need to rewire that bus SOON.  We talked to Joe, president 
of the AZ Bus Club, about the raffle bus project, and were super happy to 
hear that it finally has the vent sections welded back in.  The bus club also 
bought the front floor sections from Ronnie this weekend, so my old beater 
kombi is coming along nicely.  YAY!!
Saturday was spent pulling the carb and plugs (Jerome re-visited) and fixing 
that problem again.  Saturday night was spent drinking Kyle's fat tire beer 
and tequila, and taking pictures of him when he fell asleep next to the fire. 
   : )
Sunday we packed up and followed Everett in the barndoor back to Phoenix, 
showered at my parents house, went to the airport and flew back home to 
CA...Still haven't quite caught up on my sleep.
Thanks to the Havasu crew for putting on this great laid-back event each 
year.  For those of you who can't make it (or don't want to), you're missing 
out!!  
See you all at OCTO next weekend!
