&gt;A PO installed a bay tank in my '63 Doublecab, which is in it's own
compartment btw. Hooking the overflow/vent tube to the solid filler drain is
a good idea. Cut out a 3&quot; section, put in a T with fuel line. Maybe one of
those icemaker water line taps?
&gt;

Maybe not so good in the rain, eh? Rain I know nothing about. What is it,
like liquid sunshine? I know my buses get water in those drains when I wash
them and you would not want that in the tank. With the tee you could route
the vent so it couldn't drain into the tank.
