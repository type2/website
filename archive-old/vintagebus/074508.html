Subject: towing with a superbeetle towbar

This winter i bought a towbar that i thought it was for baywindows.  But ive
discovered later it is made for SuperBeetle.

it is a model identical to this one:
http://store.cip1_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=ACC-C10-
1402&amp;Category_Code=02-06-03-04

anybody has an idea or some picture or website about an adapter i could build
to tow my 1960 microbus , or my baywindows, or event the BEETLE 75 im planning
to make a dune buggy with ?

all of these 3 the towbar doesnt fit!
