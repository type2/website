From what I understand, P.I.P. made a deal with VW to make roof racks for the
New Beetle and as a condition of the deal they were to stop manufacturing
racks for the early models.  Why, I don't know, and I haven't spoken with
Greg, the owner of P.I.P. personally.  I guess he couldn't resist the offer
that VW made him.  Of course, this is only what I've heard.
