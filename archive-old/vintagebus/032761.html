Subject: early westy sighting
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,
Early hatch-top westy sighting yesterday. Looked to be 62-64 hatchtop with 
early woodslat rack on top. Colors were faded sealing wax red with an 
off-white top. Bus appeared to be in extremely nice original looking 
condition. Not too sure if it was just purchased as it was being trailered 
north-bound 680 in Martinez towards Sacramento, Ca. It was around 1:30 in the 
afternoon. Two younger guys in a 4x4 Ch*vy Suburban towing it.

Just curious if anyone knows who owns it or if someone on the list just 
acquired it.
Whoever has it, has a nice bus.

Hope everyone has a great turkey day,
Dave Barnes
