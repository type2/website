&lt;&lt; I purchased a middle seat from a guy in Canada thinking I would build my
 next bus around it (seeing how hard it is to find a middle seat).  I also
 bought it because it has a grab handle and is the type for a walk thru
 (2/3 - 3/4? length).  Can the list tell me if this seat is correct for a '63
 deluxe.  The grab handle has black end caps and a black center piece.  Does
 this seat come from a Kombi?  The middle seat I currently have in my '63 is
 missing the grab handle and I am not certain that it is correct.  What types
 of middle seats were made?
  &gt;&gt;
metal bars were used through 61. actually generall through 60.  61 was a one 
year only, any one have a 61 full width midle seat with whiote rubber on 
round metal bar?   didn't think so.  62- 67 has grab bars like the dah gran 
bar, plasticy rubber over non round metal
