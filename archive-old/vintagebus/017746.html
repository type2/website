&gt; While I'm at it...isn't there some way for the
&gt; people at E-bay to separate
&gt; the toys from the rest of the VW listings?

Got to ebay search. There's a place to enter &quot;words to
search for&quot; and another box for &quot;words to exclude&quot;:

In that &quot;exclude box I put &quot;matchbox MB hotwheels hot
moc mib momc coca JL&quot;


That usuually weeds out about 75% of the toys.
