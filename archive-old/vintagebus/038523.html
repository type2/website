&gt; &lt;&lt; Coasting down the rod I hear a squeeky scrape scrape scrape sound. It gets
&gt; louder when I turn right and quieter when I turn left.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already checked to make sure the drums are not rubbing on the backing
&gt; plates or shoes. I can't figure out if is coming from a reduction box or the
&gt; transaxle.

Sounds like the spider gears in the tranny.  Same thing happened to me.  Had
to go home making only left turns.
