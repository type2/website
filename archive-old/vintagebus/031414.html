Subject: Re: [VB] tire pressure

I work as the lead tech at a shop here in town where we do a good bit of 
tire sales...  For tire pressures we go by what the sticker on the door 
pillar of the car says.  Tire pressure goes by the car, and not by the 
tire.  As someone said earlier, this info is most likely outdated due to 
advances in technology (different tires).  Most cars that come in have a 
suggested tire pressure of 32psi.  This is *most* passenger style cars. 
  Most trucks that come in have a suggested tire pressure of 35psi. 
This includes your minivans, SUVs (don't even start on the Explorer), 
normal pick up trucks and things of that nature.  The larger vans that 
run LT rated tires usually run anywhere from 50psi to 80psi.  These are 
LT rated tires mind you with stiffer sidewalls.

In my buses, I run 35psi on all 4 wheels.  I haven't had any problems 
and haven't noticed any abnormal tire wear.  Tread depth is the same 
straight across.  My buses are usually run empty, but at times have a 
load (engines, wood, coolers... and they seem to do fine.  I'm not even 
sure what the sticker on the bus says to run...but this is just what I 
do.  I figure the bus is in that light truck/minivan/SUV category as far 
as weight and what not goes, so I run em at 35.
