Subject: Re: [VB] bleh! gas

'Course the
&gt; thing I hate worse about a
&gt; new to me bus is how some people leave such a short
&gt; fuel line to the tank,
&gt; so theres no slack to reach up and clamp the line
&gt; off. 

I usually use about four or five feet of fuel line
from the tank to the engine, and coil it up in the
left tray.  Then, when I pull the engine, it's most of
the way out, and easy to clamp and pull the line
without even being beneath it.
