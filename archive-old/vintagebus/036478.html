&lt;&lt; NONE, and have never blown a engine, how often do look at the gauges in 
your
 jap or U S ride? But you do notice the idiot lights when they come on. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
Well we have blown a few engines in our time!  Can honestly say that we have 
saved ourselfs from immeadiate engine rebuild at least three times and find 
gauges invaluable for diagnosing problems that otherwise would not be found 
till much later after causing damage.  As to Barb's dad's 1981 Toyota 
Corrolla Tersel all the time!  We have diagonosed cooling problems and fixed 
these before possible damage/stranding three times in the last 1-1/2 years by 
just the coolant temp gauge that just has a cold/hot and middle line to show 
what it is doing!  As for the idiot lights by the time they light up it is 
too late......    Eric&amp;Barb
