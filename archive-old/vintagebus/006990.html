After 6 months up my cover has developed some holes where it rubs on the
upper rails, going to use white duct tape on all areas now where top rubs,
also all the eyelets on the side panels ripped out, all this happened though
when we had some really nasty wind storms here. T quality of the actual
vinyl cover could be better, but for $150.00 what can you except. When the
cover goes to heck I'll recover with aluminum panels.

ps. our 120 degree heat might have something to do with it.

&gt; No; my figure was based on the fact that I had it UPS delivered, so after
&gt; delivery, tax, etc it was just a little over $200.  Mine had the back and
&gt; sides, but no front.  I still have the instructions that came with mine;
I've
&gt; always meant to contact them and see if they make a front panel/door,
which I'll bet
&gt; they do.

&gt; &gt; Costco must be higher priced in your area, in the Phoenix and Las Vegas
&gt; &gt; Costco's they are 149.95 and Big K-Mart also has the same covers for
175.00
&gt; &gt; sans back and sides.
