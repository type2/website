I saw recently in a Wolfsburg West flyer that they have put original
interior colors in rattle cans for easy spot-painting or a careful
complete redo on interiors.  They have the colors (they say) were
original on specified years of pre-68 buses. As I remember they were
somewhere around $12 a can....

In the same breath, my local auto paint shop will put any coded color,
or mixed to match a smaple, in a spray can for about $8 a can.

 I am looking for the color the
&gt; Factory would have painted them back in late 64/early 65.
&gt; 
&gt; Shift rod
&gt; E-Brake handle
&gt; Front belly pan
&gt; Turn signal switch housing
&gt; Steering wheel
&gt; Windshield Wiper arms
&gt; Steering column
&gt; Steering Column support bracket
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know what these parts may have been painted?  L-Code or name.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
