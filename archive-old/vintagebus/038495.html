Well I had to chime in on this one even though The Mothership is not a
vintage bus.  

When I left Hazlehurst GA on Jan. 9 1997 I had 1200 bucks in my pocket, no
bank account, and no credit card.  Along the way the list members were
priceless in thier offers for assistance.

I also got jobs long the way.  Let's see, I worked as a consultant/trainer
for National Service (AmeriCorps), a warehouseman, a microsoft conference
roady, a VW tune-up mechanic, a yardman, a landscaper, a carpet layer, a
veternarians assistant, a machinist.

When I arrived in Seattle I had to fly all the way back to Mississippi to do
a training session for the Governors National Service Commission there.
Those widfalls helped me a lot in my effort to move forward.  I arrived back
in hazlehurst 1 year alter, almost to the hour with about the same amount of
money in my pocket, but still no bank account or credit card.  Which I do
have both of now.

All that seems like so long ago.  I am still searching for the &quot;beginning of
wind&quot;, but have almost decided it is me.  hehehehe

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
