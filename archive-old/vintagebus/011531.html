Good Tuesday all,

        Well the next American converted VW camper on my list to research 
is &quot;Camper of America&quot;.  Thanks to Rusty Van Bondo's brochure on EZ
Campers, a great number of us have identified our non-Westy V-dub Campers.

          How about that lovely picture of Paula, by the way, in the latest
rags, during the chili cookoff.  Why havent we heard the end of that yet? 
Or, is the beginning still coming? ( I think the term self-absorbed hurt me
the most...arghhhhhh.)

        Anyway, I am calling all T2 owners out there.  Please be on the
look out for any brochures, articles, personal pictures...ANYTHING in the
way of images/description of the &quot;Camper of America&quot; camper.  

        I am posting all info sent to me to the TYPE2_dot_com website in the
reference library.  It is nothing flashy, just raw, hard facts.  This is
what I have in the Camper area so far:

Thanks again,
