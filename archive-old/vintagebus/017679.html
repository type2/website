I am pretty sure Eastwood sells a product for removing scratches in glass. I
don't think it works if the scratch fails the fingernail test(can you feel it
with your fingernail?).

If you do a search in the archives bob hoover wrote somethign up about getting
polisher yourself for your glass, it is probably under glass cleaning...if you
can't find it let me know, i am sure i have it printed it out somewhere.

anyone ever use this product? or tried those windshield places that advertise
scratch removal?


i have been meaning to clean up my glass sometimes, it is original and has a
lot of swirling kind of scratches, most apparent when driving at night(they
reflect the headlights from the cars coming the other way)
