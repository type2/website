&gt;Well this afternoon I finished my fence in the backyard so that I can keep
&gt;the 66 bus around for parts and move them over to the 67.  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I'm just gonna move a few parts over like the rear hatch with
&gt;jailbars and VW logo and then the headlights will get moved over, etc.

Take a second look at the '66 &amp; '67 bus rear hatches...

The '66 has a pushbutton latch on the hatch and the hinge carrier under 
the hatch has an indention to open the rear hatch from the bottom.

The '67 has a finger pull button latch on the hatch and the hinge carrier 
under the hatch is flat.

If you put a '66 hatch on a '67 bus, it will be tough to open the rear 
hatch from outside.  You would be better off swapping the jailbars and 
Volkswagen script from the '66 to the '67.  Be very careful when 
removing the Volkswagen script.  Take the interior panel off the hatch, 
remove the clips from the pins of the script and *carefully* push the 
pins from the inside.  Most of these scripts get broken from people 
trying to pry them off from the outside.
