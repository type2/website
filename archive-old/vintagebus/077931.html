Subject: What's up lately with Jerry Jess?

Hi all,

Glad to hear everyone had a ball at the BBB event last weekend!

Can anyone &quot;in the know&quot; update us on Jerry Jess and his recent health issues?
Hopefully he is fine, but we're all a little concerned.  Thanks for any info
you Phoenix area folks can pass on!
