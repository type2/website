Well it's late and I'm tired so no frills this time - just a quick and
honest update on the bus project.

Tonight I got one reduction box assembled and installed onto the tranny.
For a gasket, I scanned the redux box half in the scanner and in about an
hour, my brother worked the photo over and turned it into an a-1 line art
drawing.  Using the cutter plotter at work, he cut me out 2 custom gaskets
and they fit like a glove - it was neat watching that machine churn out a
gasket in about a minute.  I've saved the image so if anyone wants it in
order to make their own big nut redux half gasket,  just ask!

I also found out that I have the wrong pressure plate for this tranny.  I
have a brand new late model IRS pressure plate and I need the earlier 3
spring arm design.

That's about it - I'll post more details when I'm awake - thanks for
reading!
