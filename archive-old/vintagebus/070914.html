Subject: RE: [VB] The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em

&gt; Was looking for brake parts &quot;on the cheap&quot; for the
&gt; beater `66 s-c and saw bus depot has economy wheel
&gt; cylinders for like $6.95...wow that is cheap...my
&gt; question is has anybody used these with decent
&gt; results... Anyone know what brand these are?  It says
&gt; India-China.  I have used the India brand BI TVS years
&gt; ago and they were great....just wondering if it is the
&gt; same stuff.


Our &quot;economy&quot; parts are basically the cheapest available part within the
limits of what I feel is acceptable quality. (That is, decent quality,
return rate of less than 1%, but not necessarily up to the standards of
the original German or OEM part, as you might expect from the much lower
price.) There are of course some brands/products that I won't ship at
any price, no matter how cheap. When possible I try to offer three
levels of price/quality on most parts, when I can get it - economy, OEM
or German, and something in the middle. Sometimes this doesn't happen
either because availability isn't there, because I don't trust the only
available &quot;economy&quot; brand, or because the cheaper one is just not enough
cheaper than the good one to be even worth bothering with.  They're all
on the website. If you come across one designated a &quot;hot buy&quot; (lightning
bolt icon), it generally is because I feel it to be the best value (good
quality and price). 

The economy wheel cylinders can vary based on availability, but my last
supply was actually Brazilian-made (KMM), as is Varga. I checked with
the distributor just now and they say that this is what they are still
shipping.  We have so far had very good results with this brand.
