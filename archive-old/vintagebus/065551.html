Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Tent Poles

&gt; Last week I sent a message out about how I was looking to find a Westy tent
&gt; (pre 64) In doing so I received allot of emails inquiring if I wanted to
&gt; sell the tilt or the 62-63 middle seat I have for trading. At this time I am
&gt; only offering them as trading material.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway I may have found a tent minus the poles. Does anyone have a set of
&gt; poles for the large tent that would be willing to part with? I have cash
&gt; and/or parts to deal with.
&gt; Thanks again for everyone's help,

I still have a couple sets of my repro poles. They look and work just like the
originals, the only thing you don't get are the bathroom poles, these can be
found at any REI or other similar store and I couldn't make them for less then
they sell them.
$500 for a set of poles, or interesting trades.
