Subject: Wipers

During the &quot;drag the bus out from under the tree stage&quot; [I was going to call
it restoration, but it just doesn't feel like that.] MrMechanic said &quot;order
some wiper arms.&quot;  [and a gas tank] So I did.  When it was getting close to
time to drive the bus home, MrMechanic said &quot;order some wiper arms.&quot;  I told
him &quot;I did, they are here and you have them someplace.  They were in the box
with the gas tank.&quot;  He held them up and said .. &quot;that's not what I meant, but
you need them too.&quot;  So I went back to the Wolfsburg website and ordered what
he was calling arms, that weren't really arms, they are 2 flat metal strips,
left and right, one longer than the next.  They came and he said .. &quot;that's
not what I meant, but you need those too.&quot;  He said .. I need the part that
sticks through the holes in the bus that the arms attach to.

Meanwhile, by this time it was time to take my bus home.  So I coated the
windows with Rainex and drove away with the wiper motor sitting on the
under-the-dash-shelf connected to a wire .. Does this motor work one might ask
??? I have no clue ..  Apparently there are more pieces that I need.  Someone
said &quot;could it be the transmission?&quot;  I don't know .. I know there must be
something that attaches to the flat metal pieces .. something that I attach
the arms to .. and something that holds the motor instead of the
under-the-dash tray.  Before that was installed .. the motor just bounced
around - banged around is more like it.  I was going to secure it with duct
tape but the dash tray came and I didn't need to.

So two or three questions.

Can someone tell me the names of the parts I need ?? Where to order them ??
Or does someone here have those parts to sell?

Diane
