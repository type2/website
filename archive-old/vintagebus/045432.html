&lt;&lt; If you want to have a 1600, seems best to stay away from the 3.88, or you

Hi Volks,
We would have to dissagree about the 1600cc not being good enough.  Maybe we 
can arrange this spring to caravan with Clara to Sacramento (700 miles one 
way.) and do a little comparing.  With our 1641SP engine being only about 
56cc bigger than the 1600cc (1600cc is actually 1585cc.  Yes, VW rounded up.) 
we have plenty of power for us.  Yes, it would be fun to adapt a type 4 with 
it's fuel injection and have a ton of power and keep about he same or better 
MPG as we do now.  With our 1963 SC we recently went from a big bore 40HP 
engine with stock geared tranny to 3.875R&amp;P and .82 fourth tranny while still 
using big bore 40HP engine (Now that is definitely underpowered!).  Our top 
speed at 3,000 RPM went up from 50 to about 58MPH with same sized rear tire 
(205R15) and now the 80 mile trip between Seattle/Olympia is taking us about 
ten minutes less even our hilly PNW.  Not a huge differance but with a bigger 
engine and/or longer distances it will add up.  Also the fact of the MPG 
savings and engine longevity over just 80,000 mile period will pay off not 
only the tranny rebuild, but at least most of an engine rebuild on top of 
that.  
  So dig into the vintagebus archives, talk to fellow bussers in your area, 
get some idea of HP, torque to wieght ratios from getting rides in thier 
busses.  Then get your bus running with the engine it has a new engine and 
see how it does for you.  If you never or rarely get on the highway and just 
do in town the stock tranny might be the way to go for you.  If you are going 
to do long trips on the highways and do not want to be always feeling like 
someone is going to run over you either the 3.875 or even 3.44R&amp;P trannys 
might be what you want to choose from.  Due to the fact that some will not be 
happy with anything less than a V8 and others are happy with a 36HP engine 
makes the choice of tranny gearing a very personal one. Eric&amp;Barb
PS We would be happy to Pmail to any member the info we have put together on 
the 3.875R&amp;P tranny.  EEE&amp;B
