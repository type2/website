Subject: Re: [VB] Friday topic, Locations.

&gt; Just curious, but could everyone on the list chime in and tell what
&gt; City/State/Province/Country you are in? Might be interesting information.
&gt; You might just find a friend nearby.

I would be in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

The Vanagon list which I am also on, has a &quot;Frappr&quot; map of the USA showing
the location, pics of each listee' vehicles &amp; where they are located, etc.
Maybe someone could set one up for the vintage bus list to give it a shot of
adrenaline?
