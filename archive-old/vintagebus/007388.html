Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Sickness

Is the guarentee for the life of your bus or his shop?  Something to think
about.

If he has been around for a while...and is young enough to be around for a
while longer, I would say you can't afford not to.

&gt; I am there right now.  I want to restore my '67 kombi with a price tag of
&gt; $6500 for complete body work (got my estimate yesterday...get this, life
&gt; time guarentee on paint and rust.  He absolutely stands behind his work
for
&gt; LIFE!).  I can't afford that.  I have two kids that are in braces, one
heads
&gt; off to college in a few years, etc. etc. BUT I still sit here a think
&gt; &quot;Yeah...why not?.  Can I afford not to do it?  Short of an accident it
would
&gt; guarentee that my kids will have this bus after I croak.  I wish I could
get
&gt; vacinated or something but then what?  Boats?  Motorcycles?  Magic cards?
&gt; When you think about it there are worse sicknesses to have.  Most diseases
&gt; are not fun, but VWitis is OK.
