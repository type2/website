&gt; Now, this brings me to a thought to myself of why I have never posted a

&gt; I like them equally well and applaud them both profusely... but I digress.

Good point.
I have found that by not adding my last name to my gallery submissions I get
lumped in with that Greg Noble character (just kidding Greg) and his 624+
pictures. So for the last couple days I have been resubmitting my pictures, and
at the same time bettering mt rating as a &quot;contributor&quot; on Everetts site. I
guess Thom's is next.

I think asking first is always the way to go. It's just polite.
