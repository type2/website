Subject: Starting troubles

BlankHey -

I have a volt gauge in mi bus.(filling a hole the PO cut in the dash), and
the past week, the volts dropped low to like under 10 volts.  I had just
been messing with the stereo, so I figured it was a drain, but the stereo
wire is only live when the bus is on.  No big deal, me thinks.

Went to a job interview, started fine.  Went for gas.  No start.  Jumped it,
and it ran perfectly going home.  Drove for like twenty minutes, and when I
shut it off, and turned the key again...No start.  I charged the battery,
and it took a charge.

I have not driven the car since, and I am trying to think what could have
been the trouble.  The gen light did not go on, ever.  (I have an
alternator)  The Battery is a cheep Discount Auto Parts Battery, about two
years old.

Does anyone have experience to enlighten me?  I am hoping it is NOT the Alt.
Could the drain from the stereo suck the battery, from one stop to another?
I am a bit confuse-ed.

Thanks..
Kevin Albrecht
