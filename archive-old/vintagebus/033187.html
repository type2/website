&lt;&lt;  It's almost road ready.  I was trying to put in a new clutch cable today. 
 I can;t get the darn thing through the last little bit of the tube. &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
Did you remove the boden tube first?  Once off, slip the clutch cable through 
the body tube and then slip it through the boden tube and spring the boden 
tube and clutch cable through the rear boden tube mount on the tranny.
