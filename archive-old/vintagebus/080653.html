Subject: RE: [VB] Wolfsburg West Truck Corners

They'll go on OK - they're just slightly
different and if you don't do both sides
it looks a bit assymetrical.  But do both
sides and they are OK (certainly better than nothing).

see

For pics of rear post and corner repair on twin
cab using the wolfsburg corners.

You're sure you have the Wolfsburg TRUCK corners and not the BUS
corners (which are *really* different to truck corners)?

Anyway, holding them up to my '59 truck I'm seeing they're not right 
in shape. I guess there were different corner shapes? And these fit 
later trucks?

Anyone have experience with them?
