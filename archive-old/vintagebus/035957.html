 &lt; &quot;go out and copy all the numbers on the tag behind the passenger seat.
 resend them to the list and we can tell you all about your bus.&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Here they are....
 03  5
 430 C42 080 108
 UT 2312 523642 7121074
 
 &lt;your color code- 52 36 42 is wierd.  67 non deluxes all came w/ mesh grey
 interior which is code 83, should be the last two digits of that 6 digit
 number.  What is the actual paint colour (s) on your bus?&gt;
 
 My bus is a dull faded green color.  I'm pretty sure it has never been
 repainted.
  &gt;&gt;
If it is Velvet Green all one colour 67 I would expect the paint code on the 
tag would read 383883, and there would be a sticker on the bus unde rthe M 
code tag that would say i think  &quot;L512 Samtgru:n&quot;.  Also I think that Westys 
sometimes got a diferent code for paint because they are westys (I dont get 
it) and you may want to ask Dave Easterwood if he can figure out some codes.
