Subject: [VB] Re: What is sealing wax red?

&gt;  First off it is not a good idea to pick a color off of a magazine 
&gt;page and say
&gt;that is 'such and such' color, the same thing goes for looking at a 
&gt;color off of
&gt;your computer monitor.

I generally agree. But since we are all communicate from all over the 
world  through the internet and can't walk outside to take a 
look...you gotta start somewhere. And since, as you point out, 
computer monitors tend to have their own &quot;look&quot;, I chose a magazine 
that should, for the most part, look the same to everyone who looks 
at it. Beyond that I chose to pictures which represented the same 
general colors that I've seen at person at VW shows I've been to. I 
was basically looking for clarification if SWR was the lighter corel 
color or the darker classic car red color. Most of the time I see the 
restorations come out in quote &quot;sealing wax red&quot; and they look more 
like a shiney '57 Chevy.  I wanted to clarify why both &quot;general&quot; 
colors were being called sealing wax red. Heck, even all the toys are 
the darker red. But it seems the lighter corel color tends to be the 
&quot;right&quot; one according to MOST people on the list. Which is great...as 
I prefer it myself.

You know, many people email me about my '59 Kombi ( 
http://www.type2guy_dot_com/59/59.html ) and talk about it's RED paint 
job. Well, if you ever see it in person, it's more of an orange than 
red. It's an orange/red/melon color. But the net makes it look red 
for whatever reason.

Now, your bus at http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_dragon/61westy.html is 
beautiful. But...the same as my faded 23-window in the barn, my 4 and 
5 year old kids would call it a PINK bus. I think most folks don't 
really know what &quot;Sealing Wax Red&quot; really is. I'm pretty sure I've 
got a grasp on it now myself...and will most likely be driving one 
that color...or at least my version of that color...sometime in the 
future.

Thanks for all the discussion. Just goes to show you that there are 
still new questions to be asked and that even the dumb ones can 
create a lot of discussion. Better than another &quot;Tire Size&quot; 
thread....right!?!?!?
