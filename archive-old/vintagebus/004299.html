The 10 cent test:
1) Park the van with the wheels centered as best you can.

2) Tie a string around your rear bumper.  Run the string around to the front
bumper - but across your tires and away from the body.  Keep circling the
body all the tires until you tightly tie the sting off on the passenger
side - rear bumper.

3) Using your keen eyesight, you should be able to see if the string is
floating across the front or rear part of any tire.  If you measure the
degree difference between the direction of the tire and the string - you
have a pretty good guess of the camber?

From this, you should be able to get a rough idea about what needs to be
done.  For example, putting your front end back on the bus, adjust to rough
to save tire wear, then take it to a professional shot to get it 100% right.

Those of you who have already paid the bucks for a professional alignment,
you can check their work!

Hit a bump in the road in the middle of no where, this can help you.

Just an old Hummer trick.

&gt; How about getting an alignment?  Center the steering wheel and adjust
&gt; your toe from there. You can get this pretty close just in your
&gt; driveway.  Best to take it in and a shop can hook it up to the computer.
&gt; Are you getting any strange tire wear?  Maybe your tie rods are bent.
&gt; Does the bus pull to the left or right if you are driving and let go of
&gt; the wheel?

&gt;  &gt; I have the same problem, and my wheels rub if I turn my wheel to far. I
&gt;  &gt; think we have to disconnect the shaft to the arm below, check the wheel
&gt;  &gt; travel in both directions (I imagine you can make the bus tunr only
&gt; so far
&gt;  &gt; in ONE direction with this wrong, center the unit, and reconnect the
&gt; shaft.
&gt;  &gt; I don't beleive removing the wheel will help at all.

&gt;  &gt; OK, sad post of the week.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; When driving in a straight line, my steering wheel spokes are at 1 &amp; 7
&gt;  &gt; o'clock.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; This really bugs me, but 'cos it is a keyed shaft, I can't see how to
&gt;  &gt; get them to 3&amp;9.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Any ideas?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; TIA
&gt;  &gt; Simon.
