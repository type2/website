&gt; 68 on were a U shaped cross section poles.  We are not sure if the hooked
&gt; ends at this point got thinner.
&gt; Somewhere after 68 both U shaped poles where telescopic.  Possibly to
allow
&gt; installation in the pre-1968 Westies?   Eric&amp;Barb

68 - early 69 were round and black. They were 56 1/4'' long.
They bent very easily.
Sometime in early 69 the bars changed to 3 sided galvanized. They were
stronger. From 68 to 73 all were 56 1/4'' long. They stored up on top of the
pass. side cabinet. Yes they hung over the edge, but VW stapled a grey vinyl
pouch to the top of the cab for the ends to stay on. Starting in 74, the
half moons were lowered on the A and B pillars. 74 and 75 bars are 57 1/4''
long. They were stored under the full width bench seat/bed. Starting 76, the
Westy layout changed. All the appliances went along the drivers wall and the
bench seat/bed became 3/4 wide. This is why the bars became telescoping. The
only place to store the collapsible bars is under the 3/4 seat. You can use
the 74/75 57 1/4'' bars in a 76 to 79 but you will have nowhere to store
them.
The collapsible bars will work on a 67 and earlier. The front bar is 47''
long and the minimum collapsed length of a 76 up bar is 46 1/4'' long.
But.....good luck finding a pair!!

I have a couple extra pairs of round black 68 bars. They can be made to work
in a split by cutting and rewelding. They are 56 1/4'' long. You would need
to make one 47'' and the other 55 1/4''.
