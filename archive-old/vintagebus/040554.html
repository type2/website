Please forgive me if it's already been suggested. Somehow, I think I've missed part of this tread...

But lately, I've been having some power/sputtering problems off and on that have all be attributable to intake and exhaust leaks. Much of this I blame on crappy Brazilian mufflers...but there's already a thread on that. Bottom line, if you've recently worked on your intake or exhaust, you might try tightening the nuts &amp; bolts around and about...and check those intake boots.

The cause evaded me for a while because the traditional &quot;spray WD-40 on the leaks&quot; method for checking this didn't show any changes...and the bus seemed to run fine in the driveway.

But on the highway, I could notice marked sluggishness and poor acceleration.

Good luck! Joe
