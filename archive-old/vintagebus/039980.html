Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Ditto here,

Living in Orange County is somewhat of a double-edged sword. I want to wave 
at all the buses, split or not, but lots of them are too snooty to wave 
back. I always get good reception from the splitties, but the bays and 
later, esp T4, often give me the confused look...

&gt;Here in Southern California, if we waved at every bus we would have
&gt;arm cramps. I typically reserve my waving for splitties because they
&gt;are not as common (and I drive one). But if another bus driver waves,
&gt;I always return the favor no matter what they are driving. My son and
&gt;I love VW buses and we are always &quot;checkout&quot; splitties AND bays. (...)

&gt;&gt;Well, it's friday, so I guess I'm alright to ramble here for a
&gt;&gt;spell.  This past Wednesday, I was cruising down Rt. 68 in Xenia,
&gt;&gt;Ohio in my '66 Camper.  A buddy of mine was driving right behind me
&gt;&gt;in my '83 Vanagon. We were returning from a rock-climbing trip in
&gt;&gt;Clifton Gorge where we took a bunch of teen-agers from the YMCA teen
&gt;&gt;camp.  Right outside of town, I see a nice blue and white bay window
&gt;&gt;coming at me, nice bus.  So, of course I give a big, nice, friendly
&gt;&gt;wave out the window.  I get NOTHING from the bay window driver.  I
&gt;&gt;look in my rear-view and my buddy driving the Vanagon does the same
&gt;&gt;as me, gives a big friendly greeting.  Again, NOTHING from the
&gt;&gt;driver of the bay window! So, WTF?!?!?  This is the first time EVER
&gt;&gt;that I have been in my bus and NOT gotten a wave from another
&gt;&gt;passing bus driver.  Here in Ohio, air cooled buses are few and far
&gt;&gt;between, and when I see another one on the road I get very excited.
&gt;&gt;It's kinda like being told &quot;Hey, you're not alone out ther!
&gt;&gt;!
&gt;&gt;e!&quot; So, am I the only who feels like this when I see another bus on
&gt;&gt;the road? Tell me there are more people who do... Oh my God, I'm not
&gt;&gt;a freak am I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last
&gt;&gt;question....
