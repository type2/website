Subject: speaking of paint...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while there are paint questions floating around, i was just wonder what 
exactly color sanding and buffing consisted of. i plan to spray mine with the 
omni au single stage paint (blue/white). i know single stage needs to be 
buffed and color sanded but what exactly is this....thanks
