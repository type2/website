Hi y'all
Got the engine in today with the able assistance of my wife.  She had a BALL!  Ran
metal fuel line as much as I could,
being a non-believer in rubber, vibration, and gasoline.  I have a few questions if
you'd care to share your
collective experience.  Please keep in mind the Ark has been non-running for the
last 4 years at least.

Holding the choke open and pumping the gas I see little spurts of gas.  Not a good
stream like I'm used to seeing.
Think maybe the cark could use some tender ministrations?  She'll fire up if I pour
gas down Carb (fire extinguosher at the ready) but promply dies.  Carb's a Pict 30.

I installed a Pertronice electronic ignitor and an Accel supercoil.  I've has good
fortune with Accel in the past.  Anyone have
any suggestions (besides carry a set of points in case)?

I'm psyched!  Gonna go buy tyres tomorrow and maybe if the FLAPS has a carb kit
slip my old plates from the stealth truck on and go for a putt down the street..

Any and all replies welcome!

Dave
