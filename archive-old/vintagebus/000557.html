&lt;&lt; do i stick the feeler gauge between the lower part of the valves or the 
upper? &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
Upper.  Between the screw and the end of the valve stem.  Plus while you are 
inserting the feeler gauge push a finger on the lower end of the rocker arm 
where those straight lined knurls are.  This pressure removes all the slack 
in the cam/tappets/push rod/rocker arm to give you much more accurate 
measurement.  Definitely invest in a &quot;Idiot's guide&quot; by John Muir and later 
getting the Bus shop manual from Bentley.    Eric&amp;Barb
