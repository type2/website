Subject: Re: [VB] RE: water spots


#4 or 0000?
#4 sounds like it is very coarse and would scratch glass.
I use a product made to remove water spots. Called Shiny Brite II. Not sure
how wide a selling area it has since it is made here in Fresno, Calif. I am
sure a product like it is available at any big real hardware store.
On the back of the bottle, it says: &quot;A safe, easy to use formula for removal
of hard water stains from clear shower doors and enclosures, patio doors and
vehicle safety glass&quot;.
They also make Shiny Bright, but you can't use it on tempered glass.


&gt; I have found that #4 steel wool is a Vantastic cleaner on a lot of
&gt; non-paimted surfaces--I clean my windows with #4 steel wool and everything
&gt; comes off--TWWM, uj
