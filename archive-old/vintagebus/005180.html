Hey Everyone,

I just got my new 1955 SC Monday morning 2 am!  It's been such terrible
weather, here in Florida, that today was the first chance I had to work on
him. The brake pedal had a large amount of play, so I began with them. After
pulling the hubs, the brake shoes look great...they were just really out of
adjustment. I went through and packed the bearings, lubed the front,
re-installed and adjusted. Feels much better now, nice and firm...though the
pedal isn't fully returning, it kinda lays down about an inch. I can pull
the pedal up with my hand, but when I let go it drops down freely.  I
crawled underneath to investigate. Between the pedal lever and the push rod,
there is a round coiled up spring. This spring just rolls around and isn't
attached to anything. One end of the spring has a little arm, but the other
end is flush with the coil. Is this spring supposed to be there, or is this
some kind of homemade rigging? I've checked in all my manuals and none show
a return spring.


sincerely,


Tom
