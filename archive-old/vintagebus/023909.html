Subject: 61 Westy FS

Hello All:  My wife and I have decided to sell our 61 Westy...... It’s 
the SO-34 model w/submarine hatch and flipseat interior. There is
also a gas heater mounted by the engine We also have the original 
yellow/gray side mounted tent.
The bus is very straight with some minor surface rust.  Floors are 
solid w/no rust thu. Only rust thu is right above the jack
thingies on both sides. Original paint is in good shape
 (white over red)  The front door panels need to be replaced.
Also there is a ladder for the roof rack....roof racking is 
missing..... Have all new rubber to install in the front doors.... 
all glass is good. We are going to try and have the bus at the VW 
shows in Colo. this weekend. Asking $4500 If it doesn’t sell this
weekend will move it with us to Dallas.
Thanks,  Doc
