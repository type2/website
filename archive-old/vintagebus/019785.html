&gt; Are you *sure* the bolts go thru the case, and it's not just the big plug on the back side leaking, and the fluid isn't wicking thru the threads?

I didn't think of the freeze plug at all...it was sealed with the same stuff 
that the case halves are sealed with, and those don't leak.  I backed off the
bolts, though, and more oil came out as the spring plate backed away from the
RGB.  

I'd like to know for certain what the heck is going on before I call the
rebuilder.  Is it safe to remove the bolts and lever the spring plate up so
I can look at the plug, assuming I support the side I'm working on with a 
jackstand?
