Subject: a light in the engine compartment...

Hi all,

I too added a light inside my engine compartment for roadside repairs.  
I located an extra stock Bus ceiling dome light assembly about two or 
three inches forward of the rearward end of the ceiling of the engine 
compartment.  I ran the power line (fused) over to the positive battery 
terminal. Now if I want to do a roadside adjustment/repair in the dark, 
I just open up the engine deck lid and reach up and turn on the stock 
dome light for illumination.  Works great and appears very &quot;stock&quot; 
looking although we all know better.  I only had to drill two small 
holes in the ceiling.  A great compromise!

Happy New Year to us all!

Bill Bowman
