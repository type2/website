I have to agree with NQ here. I snug the clamps down tight and they show
no sign of moving at all or tearing anything up. I suppose for insurance
you could clamp a second set on so that each arm of the towbar is
secured by one on each side. As mentioned before, the real fix is to
have a wider version of the towbar.

.... I can see how there might need to be some reinforcement added on
around the little fingers that slide up on the beam but I really like my
towbar and haven't had any of the problems
that have been mentioned....

Welding on a gusset to these fingers would sure help. Also, drilling new
holes to mount the keeper pin/bolt closer to the tube would reduce the
amount of leverage applied to the fingers by some degree. I've used my
towbar off and on for about a year and I see no signs of the fingers
bending. Using the spacer for the required beam diameter may be a factor
also.

....Plus, anyone who travels freeway speeds with an old bus in tow is
just asking for trouble no matter how they tow it short of using a
trailer....

To date, all of my towing has been in town on surface streets, probably
40 mph max. So far this has worked out fine. If I was going on the
freeway or at freeway speeds, I have to agree with the earlier comments,
I'd use a dolly or trailer.

Thanks for your feedback, interesting as always.
