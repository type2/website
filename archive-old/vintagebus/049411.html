Subject: westfalia question
Message-ID: &lt;t970417528.c3.u2100038903_at_d701302117.iopener_dot_net&gt;

at a recent show i saw a 67 westfalia, with a table behind the pasenger side seat with the clear holder for the aluminum glasses  , hinged on the back of the seat was a clear rectangled box that was hinged where it would cover the glasses, was this a accessory in the 60's or something that thet added on later?the lady said the glasses had been used one time and that she let her grand daughter get a drink of water with it. all of the plastic was clear and unscratched as was the glasses it all looked like it had just been unwrapped .
