&gt; &gt; Here is the rough estimate I received for extracting that single cab in that
&gt; &gt; yard.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I guess it was worth a try...
&gt; Thom,
&gt; 
&gt; There are many engineers and just generally creative folk on this list...
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps if you describe the situation we can come up with some ingenious
&gt; solution that wont involve an airlift...

Take about a kilogram of plastique.  Spread many small blobs between the
bus and the vehicle below.  Set off simultaneously and bus will rise
magestically into the air.

Unfortunately, at this point my muse left me, so you'll have to get the
bus down on your own.
