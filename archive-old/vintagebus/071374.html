Subject: RE:  latex gloves

I had this problem as well when using a box of nitrile un-powdered mediums I
got for free from work. The ones I did manage to get on without tearing fit
tightly and became like a second skin after a few minutes. Held up well
against Aircraft Remover (burned right through the latex gloves). Next time
I buy a box I'd try a larger size and find powdered ones.

&gt; I bought those nitrile gloves _at_ Harbor Freight &amp; I get 1 one on a hand for
&gt; about every one that tears apart in trying to get it on!  Is it only moi?
&gt; Maybe I got the wrong size for my hands?
&gt;
&gt; Tom Buese- never bend over in front of someone w/ nitrile goves on.
