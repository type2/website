&gt;I just entered the wonderful world of type2s!  A couple of weeks ago, I
&gt;bought a '65 Sundial, in solid, yet rough shape.   I'm wondering if anyone
&gt;has a spare Bentley book in the same shape, for not a lot of $$$?  I've
&gt;done a lot of work on T1s, but I'm pretty lost when it comes to redux
&gt;boxes, and all of that stuff....   I really don't want to spend $95 unless
&gt;I really have to.  I don't care if it's greasy and the cover's gone, just
&gt;as long as the info is there and it's relatively readable.   I'm looking
&gt;forward to getting the bus on the road and doing a bit of traveling.


Do searches for the manual on BestBookBuys_dot_com &amp; PriceScan_dot_com.  You should
be able to get the manual for around $65, including delivery.
