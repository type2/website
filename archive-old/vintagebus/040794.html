 &gt; I purchased a set of elephant ear side mirrors from Latest Rage
&gt; for $15 each and find them to be most excellent.  I figured since
&gt; they are made in Tiawan they would be inferior to the Roscoe
&gt; reproductions ($25 each), but honestly they look identical.



Careful there; you could perhaps be speaking too soon.  The fatal flaw of
many budget-priced aftermarket exterior parts that I've seen is that they
tend to rust very quickly, even though they look great when new.  Unless you
have had these for a while, you may not yet be in a position to judge this.
(Not that it will neccessarily be the case; I'm speaking generally here.)
