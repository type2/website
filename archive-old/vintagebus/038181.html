 Hi list,
 
 Can anyone tell me why both of the rear brake shoes that have the e brake
 lever attached to them would have worn out completely and both opposing
 shoes have not. The worn ones have about 1mm of material left while the less
 worn ones still have at least 7mm.
 
 Also, the worn(e braked) shoes have worn at a slight angle ie. more on one
 edge than the other.
 
 At first I thought that it was clogged flex lines but I figure that that
 would affect all the rear shoes. Is that assumption correct?
 
 Then I thought that it might be the e brake adjustment being too tight but
 the e brake only grabs when it is three or four notches from the end.
 
 Any suggestions would be welcome.
 
 TIA
 
 Michael

somebody had been driving with the parking brake on.  this causes uneven 
shoes wear.
