&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt; Not if they are that old and hard!  Though if they were younger they 
&gt; are not 
&gt; much bigger than the stock 6.4x15 tires used between 1955-63.  You 
&gt; might want 
&gt; instead to get a good quality set of P or LT205/75R15s 

That's what i ran on the rear of the Ch**y 
they are darn close to the same diam as the 700s 
which i ran on the front (w/ new recaps)

PS 
I had a fouled plug on the Chirco long block i ran from N. Mex.
 the ring gaps were lined up the piston and pumping oil into the cylinder
could they turn on their own?
Here's the weird part, I was waiting to do the valve adjust when i got
into Cal. 
Then when started adjusting to i discovered  a intake rocker completely
off the push rod. 
I was running 60 mph on three cylinders.
I would smoke on starting and after idling but not all the time until the
plug fouled fully

lessons learned; 
its not a ch**y stupid. Wait for the oil to run down to the sump, then
check it.
The oil was pumped into the cylinder and when our hero checked it at the
gas stops the stick showed low. When our zero added oil, this was pumped
out the exhaust  or was burned by the then not fouled plug

Weird baby!

Aloha
