Just received my Press Kit from the Detroit auto show on the new Microbus,
includes slides ,a cd rom and propaganda and a couple posters, I'll save
this for the future so I'll have some NOS bus literature! I will have this
at BBB V for your viewing pleasure.

I have the trailer connected to my F_at_rd for those that might break down
within 100 or so miles to BBB V, I will be checking my messages at the shop
for anybody that might need help.

BBB V weather report for this weekend  mid to high 60's (usually means 70's)
clear skies and cool nights (40's). Lou (Volks-dragon) informed me that he
is bringing a load of free firewood and we will have a truck load of
firewood there for sale ($5.00 a wheel barrel full) this is done on the
honor system.

London Bridge Bullis are gearing up for the free TACO's Friday night (have
enough supplies for 400 or so TACO's)

Raffle prizes keep rolling in, latest arrive, a steering wheel resto from
KOCH&quot;s.
Turn key raffle engine runs like a top, we will be running it all weekend on
and off (park next to it and you can run tubes from the heater boxes to your
van)

Ronnie  London Bridge Bullis
