Subject: Re: [VB] What do you know about Kamper Kits?
To: taylorvw_at_redshift_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The seats are covered in that same red vinyl with white piping- the front 
seats that is, it is a walk through.  I think one has a rip.  I am not 
particularly attached, but dont feel like removing the covers, and the bus 
does need to have seats.

 &gt;I have a couple of those cushions- the rear ones, if someone is
 interested.   
 &gt;bus has matching front seats too.  But it needs seats.  
 
 Yeah, I have the red rear cushions with white piping.  But my front seats
 don't match...they're gray or maybe salt &amp; pepper (they're pretty
 thrashed).  Clara, if you mean you just have the covers...email me, I want 
em.
 
 &gt;hey the kamper kit 
 &gt;was gone, maybe it was a Kamper Kit camper too.  Maybe I should check the M 
 &gt;code tag and see if it was sent to San Francisco, what is that code for
 SF?   
 &gt;F?  It has older white/green plates, but don't think they are correct for
 the 
 &gt;year the bus was made, so it could have been a california car.  It has that 
 &gt;foam stuff stuck to the walls and ceiling, you know the stuff that acts 
like 
 &gt;a sponge to rust the bus. &gt;&gt;
