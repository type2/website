Subject: Cleaning armrests, in need of a seat armrest and in need of a
  good powder coater in the Tacoma Area

I am finally getting around to the interior in the bus, it is suppose to
be a turkis green deluxe. and I am doing the seats and panels in the
original colors (Wolfsburg west style) anyway I just picked up a set of
armrests that have a bit of black mold on them. I am wondering how one
goes about cleaning this off of them?
 
I was also wondering if anyone knows where to get a armrest pad for my
2/3 middle seat? It doesn't look like they are made. anyone know of of
any leads to one or someone that could manufacture one? If I find one
another color than green is there a type of die or paint that I can use
to make it green?
 
Also it looks like the best solution for the seat frames is going to be
powdercating them, does anyone know of a good shop here in the Tacoma
Washington area?
As always thanks in advance,
Shawn
