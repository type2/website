&gt;I just adjusted the valves and had recently futzed with the carb and 
&gt;timing to try and cure my incureabel flat spot

You changed three things and now it runs hot.  Change all three back
and it should run like it did.  If it doesn't, and you're sure you
put everything back like it was, then something else broke.  If you
think you leaned out the carb, you might put it back where it was
and then a little more toward the rich side.

One thing that might have changed - maybe you sucked a rag or some
paper or something into the fan.  Make sure the fan is clear of
debris and make sure the bits under the tin you can reach easily (like
around the spark plug holes) don't have pieces of paper or whatever
in them.  You might try disconnecting the heater-box-to-body hoses
under the Bus, turning the heat on, and firing up the engine to make
sure you get about the same amount of air from both sides - if not
one side may be plugged up.

From the next message:

&gt;I've taken out the rear (closest to exhaust) oil relief valve and 
&gt;spring.  When it fell out, I couldn't see which end (cupped or solid)
&gt;came out first.

Per Muir, &quot;the hole in the plunger points down.&quot;

Good luck!
