I've rebuilt enough of them and their stupid little green &quot;O&quot; rings around
the cylinders! Heck, the gasket kit costs about as much as the rebuild!
Remember to put a ground strap from both heads to the crankcase or the
electrolisis will eat up the head gasket mating surface. And you don't need
a special tool for the #2 wrist pin removal, just rotate the crank untill
the wristpin is even with the water pump hole and use a 7/8&quot; easy out and
pull the wrist pin right through the water pump hole. Oh, and stay away from
first year 83 waterboxers, odd size 215mm flywheel. Go with 84 to 90 with
the 228mm flywheel.

I am looking for the spring 2001 issue that has the first part of a
waterboxer rebuild article in it.  If anyone has this issue and can part
with it, let me know.

&gt;     GOOD NEWS, for those of you that don't subscribe to Camper and
&gt; Commercial magazine from England, I will be a dealer for it over here. At
&gt; this time I have an order in for 10 copies and can up it with-in the next
&gt; week
&gt; if there is a lot of interest.
&gt;    The next issue will be out in March and I should have them even before
&gt; subscribers. I do not have an exact total of the cost but they will be
3.50
&gt; pounds (whatever that is in dollars) and post. I will divide the post up
&gt; between the number of copies and add that to the magazine cost.
&gt;     I have also talked to them about carrying Total VW, if there is
&gt; enough interest I will bring those in also
&gt;
&gt;   The March issue has an article on Dan Kinsey's Binz that was redone by
&gt; Kustom Koach Werks in Grand Junction Colorado.
