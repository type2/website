Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Bus Update (4-1-00) No Joking! (LONG)

Even though they were just filthy from head to toe by the end of
&gt;the day, they were still all smiles because they are looking forwards to our
&gt;road trip to Minnesota later this year.

I hope you'll get a hold of me when you get up this way.  I'd love to see
your Bus, and maybe you can advise me on mine.  Email me when the time
grows near.



Today, the drums will get the rust removal
&gt;treatment and then I'll take them down and have them turned before I POR15
&gt;them.

I would advise AGAINST POR15 on brake drums.  The drums need to dissipate
heat, and that heavy coating will interfere with that, which will diminish
braking power and cook your bearings and seals.  The drums will never rust
through anyway.  I always paint drums with a light coating of flat black
spray paint.  Flat black has the best heat dissipation characteristics of
any color.

Thanks for the progress report.  I can't wait to get started on mine!
