Subject: Re: RE: [VB] re: dynamat

I recently did my 60 Standard.  I picked up 100sq ft of material called fatmat, basically a knockoff of the dynamat extreme.  Was $100 and covered all of the walls, double layer over the engine, and some portions of the roof.  I am very pleased with the results and it was easy to install.

I got it at www.fatmat_dot_com

&gt; 	On my 65 I have gone a different route and it appears to dampen well
&gt; too (No Smell). I use the same type of material as Dynamat but cheaper. You
&gt; can get it at Home Depot for $60 dollars a box and it will do the whole bus.
&gt; It is used on roofs and is made out of the same tarish type of material with
&gt; an adhesive side and a clear plastic side. I am in the process of installing
