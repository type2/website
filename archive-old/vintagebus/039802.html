Hey all,

My 66 dlx came w/ 15 in beatle rims actually originally one of the 15s was a 
spare and my dump PO had a 14in bus rim on one reduction box and a 15 on the 
other!  Anyway I had 205/75 cheasy radials and they performed great but 
looked like hummer tire to me.  My speedo was a little slow bus my bus was 
very quick off the line and at highway speeds.  I could run 65--70 w/o 
freaking out, now I have 60 series on and they look much better bus my 
performance totally sucks!  So I may elect to run 75s on the rear.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I run P205-75R's on my 15&quot; wheels. The speedo is bang on when I time
&gt;it against the highway mile markers. &gt;
