&gt; The NOS swivel seat up on eBay right now.  I think it's Greg's at Vintage Warehouse.  I have a sneaking suspicion as to why he's probably selling it.  One, we all saw the swivel seat a few weeks ago sell for big bucks, but more imprtantly, two, he's getting ready to buy a RHD Barndoor.  So, yes, he's trying to sell it for as much as he can, but at least he's reinvesting back into the VW community.  (this is only speculation with Greg, sorry if I'm wrong)

This is *somewhat* true. I actually offered the seat up to &quot;the list&quot; weeks BEFORE I saw one on eBay. No one bit, and my asking price was and still is less than the used one went for. After a few posts about the &quot;other&quot; seat I again let &quot;the list&quot; know I had one for less. Still no takers..............Ebay it, to get rid of it!!

Yeah I'm gonna step up and buy the RHD BD, and I'm sure I'll need some pieces for it here and there. I'll probably find them on eBay, I too spend the majority of my eBay money (probably more) buying other VW parts and cars. It works for me and I'm not complaining.
