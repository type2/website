&lt;&lt; some use it in hopes of establishing a value for their goods; basically, 
 to see how much someone &quot;clicks&quot; that they'll pay.  ...snip... people are 
more willing to incrementally bid on an item with a $1 opening bid and a $300 
reserve, as opposed to an item with a $300 starting bid and no reserve.  Go 
figger.  &gt;&gt;

I only use a reserve with a big ticket item that I don't want to lose my 
shorts on and do not reveal what the reserve is.  I think we all have an idea 
of what we would like to/need to get for something when we sell it if it be 
through a swap meet or on Ebay.  Problem is what we want and what it is worth 
are sometimes two different things.  In the end worth, value or what ever you 
want to call it is determined by the buyer, not the seller.  An item is worth 
what the buyer(s) is willing to pay.  How do you find out what an item is 
worth if you reveal your reserve?  In the recent case of the DD middle seat 
do we really know what the seat is worth?  Nope.  Reason is someone found out 
what the reserve was and bid just under it knowing that they wouldn't have to 
buy it.  All we know is it isn't worth $3,000.   Beyond that we don't know 
much.  So anyway, I use a reserve to check what I think something is worth 
vs. what someone is willing to pay - the real worth.
