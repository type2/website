Actually, it can happen.  A very early T3 ghia was rescued from a
Pick-N-Pull earlier this year, thanks in part to VB lismember Tom Mink.

&gt;&gt; In California you CANNOT buy a vehicle from most 'pick a part', 'pick your

&gt;&gt; dealers license. They only have a dismantlers license.
&gt;&gt; You can only buy parts that you can carry out thru the narrow front gate.

&gt;One more reason to cheer when California finally falls into the Pacific.
