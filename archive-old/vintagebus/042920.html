My stable is pretty bare right now:

'57 Standard, maroon, silver/grey, and primer all over.  Rust only in the
front floors (cargo area has been replaced along with the rockers).  No
dents except for the newly aquired front ribbed bumper.  Daily driver.

'61 15-window deluxe, OG paint except for a couple spots where the PO has
ground down to bare metal years ago :(  Rusty cargo area, rusty front
floors, busted windows, missing engine and a bunch of other parts.  In
other words....Major project -or- parts donor (what's left).  

Oh yeah, and I own some bugs too, but you guys don't care about that.
