Zac,
to see your motors are running too hot, take them on a nice test ride in the
heat of the sun. then park, and grab the dipstick. If you can hold dipstick
handle without sustaining burns, you're okay. If you can't grab and hold the
dipstick, start looking for a source of overheating.

go out and get a timing light, preferably one with an adjustable advance
knob, sears sells this model for $60 or so dollars.
start out with the car, distributor cap, and valve covers off. Bring the
motor to top dead center for number one, using only the movement of the
tappets or coat hanger in the spark plug hole methods. Once you're positive
your there, make a white out mark on your pulley at 12 o'clock. make a mark
there with some white out on that spot on the pulley. ignore or blacken all
other marks. loosen your distributor and swing it around so the rotor and
notch on the housing are aligned. put your valve covers &amp; distributor cap
back on. put the key to the first notch, hook up your test lamp to the
condensor wire where it meets the coil and turn the distributor till the test
light turns on. turn off the key, remove test lamp and hook up timing light
in it's place. start and warm up motor. point timing light at 12 o'clock on
pulley and pull the trigger. turn advance knob to zero.  your mark should be
right where you put it. turn your advance knob to 5 degrees before tdc, you
pulley mark should have moved away from 12 o'clock. spin your distributor
till it lines back up at 12 o'clock. tighten distributor clamp a little.
begin driving it around the block and slightly advancing the distributor
(counterclockwise) until it feels good. then check total advance by rehooking
up your advance light, starting the motor, and  turn your knob to 28 degrees
btdc, pull back on cam to what sounds like highway rpms for a few seconds and
watch your notch, it should move toward 12 oclock but not past it.repeat as
necessary. If it goes past 12, then turn your distributor clockwise until
when you rev it to high rpms, it approaches 12 oclock but doesnt' pass it.
tighten everything down and test ride it. reset carb idle if necessary.
Listen for engine pinging on a highway test ride to determine if your too
advanced. you shouldn't be.

  BTW, Muir's preference for mechanical distributors is based on sound logic.
Mechanicals don't have a vacuum unit that can fail on the fly. but most
people like the stock system because it tolerates less precision in driving
habits. I have recently tried a stock distributor and agree that it feels
nice. course I don't want to start that whole debate again.
