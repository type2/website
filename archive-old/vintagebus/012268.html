&lt;&lt;BTW you will also need two sections of alum. channel that is screwed or
&gt;&gt; pop-rivited to the drip rail.  &gt;&gt;

NO! Don't drill, screw, or pop-rivet your buses! Whew, that was close!!!

The aluminum rail pieces that secure the gusset of the Westfalia &quot;Greyhound&quot;
brand '67 floorless tent to the bus is similar to but not exactly match
common RV &quot;C&quot; channel. The OEM pieces were secured to the rain gutter via a
threaded machine screw, the rail itself, the gutter, a bent metal piece with
a hole drilled in it, a washer, and a nut. The rail piece is secured by the
hardware and the tension of the clip on the backside of the gutter. There
are no holes drilled into the raingutter of the Westy that I have.

Some American fubared campers that I've seen have had the common aluminum
&quot;C&quot; channel screwed through the gutter. One weird poptop that I had for a
short time had this feature. It also appeared to have window putty caulking
between the bus and the C channel rail. The Eriba Puck has this channel
affixed to it and seems to be just fine. 
I see nothing wrong with a bus with the holes drilled into it as long as the
damage had already been by some dude named &quot;Bonger&quot; in the early 1970's and
not by you on this upcoming weekend. &lt;Gawd, I'm sounding like a freakin
Vintage Nazi&gt; If your bus doesn't have a bazillion holes along the rain
gutter then be glad. &quot;Bonger&quot; is now probably a Pentacostal preacher, owner
of an SUV and the head kazoo (galoot-with a briefcase) of the Republican
Party. It is believable that any of the American conversion companies did
use the C channel. Hell, they used common wall paneling...
