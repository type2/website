To Jack and all.
my 67 with a 1600 dual port and extractors cruises at 70+on flat ground at 
half throttle. Temp at &lt;210 in the summer, tach at ~4100. WOT on flat sea 
level is 85+ at 4600+ and after 15 minutes, temp rises to 230.
I usually shift at 4200 +/-
30,000 miles on the rebuild (stock parts by commercial rebuilder), I use Red 
Line 20W-50 synthetic oil and change at 3,000.
Works for me.
