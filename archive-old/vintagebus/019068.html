So I've gotten several queries about where exactly these files are,
alternate methods of packaging them, and so on.  I also got some
information I was not aware of from the actual owner of the files,
Andrew M.:


	[...] the PDFs are a mess anyway, many of them have been
	corrupted somehow (probably from now gone flaky hardware of
	mine). [...] I will put up notice that the PDFs are bad and
	temporarily close down the site until I can get new ones.
	[...]  To make a long story short, go ahead and take the files
	offline if you haven't already.  People are wasting their time
	and your bandwidth currently DLing them since they're bad.

So, it seems like there's not much point in worrying about it at this
point.  When Andrew's gotten things straightened out, he'll be posting
about it to the list.
