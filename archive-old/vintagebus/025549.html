Subject: Extra TMI Upholstery fo sale
Message-ID: &lt;376C5ED8.676814D8_at_iquest_dot_net&gt;

TMI inadvertently sent me upholstery for a middle bench seat with
folding backrest for a 1966 Deluxe bus.  I had ordered the upholstery
for a 3/4
middle bench seat.  Problem is I had the covers made in a custom color.
They are white with red piping and are finished in vintage leatherette.
I'm going to have to reorder the correct part from TMI and I'm willing
to bet that since the other ones are custom, they won't take them back.
I paid
$145, but I'd settle for half.  It's a shame for them to go to waste.
If anyone is interested email me.  I'll pay the freight.

Thanks,

John
