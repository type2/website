Hey greg,
        your right they have a peddle to activate them.I was thinking of the
retractable front steps
VW sold.You might be right ,they may have been an option,but i  have only seen
them on ambulances.
I guess these days they're worth as much as a guy can get for them.I've never
seen one for sale.
Anybody seen one at a swap?
    I bought a cherry ,stationary type, last year for $70.
    good luck on your hunt!
            woody

&gt; I know what it is.
&gt; Fixed ambulance bus side step.
&gt; Has a little peddle that you push and it &quot;retracts&quot; out from under the bus.
&gt; Also optional for standards, deluxes, westys, whatever.
&gt; Am I insane thinking I was going to find one for around 200$ is very nice
&gt; condition?
&gt; I thought that was the &quot;going&quot; rate.
&gt; Please someone let me know if I am dreaming.....
&gt; I may have to reconsider.....

&gt; &gt; Early Ambulance side step. OK Condition. Call 8am-3pm or weekends. Or
&gt; &gt; Email anytime.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Damn and you guys think Im a price gouger!?
&gt; &gt; Ive wanted a step like this, have been offered them in the last few months
&gt; &gt; for around 150$.
&gt;
&gt; Before everybody lynches this guy.It might be the style step that
&gt; moves in  when you close the cargo doors and out when you open them.
&gt; Ambulance only step!!!
&gt; Much much more elaborate than a normal step.
&gt; not sure if it's worth $800 but worth quite a bit!!
