&gt; I remeber that in Wisconsin or Iowa a few years ago,
&gt; some Amish went to court to try to be allowed to use
&gt; black and white SMV signs instead of orange as they
&gt; felt orange ones were too flashy for their relegion.
&gt; I don't recall what the outcome was.

There have been several cases like this with results ranging from allowing
Amish to use retroreflective grey tape to outline the rear shape of their
buggies to requiring them to use the orange triangles until the law is
changed to allow alternatives.

It is interesting to note that quite a few drivers don't know what the SMV
triangle means:
