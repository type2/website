Subject: 3rd and 4th synchros
Message-Id: &lt;Pine.SUN.3.92.981207092301.3121G-100000_at_cks&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am looking for new or as little as 10% worn 3rd-4th gear synchros (the
brass ones) for a T-I splitcase tranny.  Even tho this isn't the T-I list,
I am hoping some synchros may be found here.
I have a '56 Kabriolett trans rebuild underway and have been having a hell
of a time finding those things in more than 50% wear out condition.
New, they may last 200K miles, and at 50% that's 100K or less.  Not
acceptable.  Any and all help or leads are greatly appreciated.
Thanks
later
