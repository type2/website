Subject: re:new gas tank install...and more..

Sorry about this groups of posts...i need to read my old emails more
closely. I thought I had asked the list about this a while ago, while I was
trying to get all the parts. Now that I have the parts-I was re-posting my
question.

I just did an archive search and found some answers...
&quot;Lastly we cut or pull out the shorter reserve brass tube, this then helps 
keep the water out of the bottom of the fuel tank instead of trapping it
there.&quot;

The tap I got has a longer tube that is brass and a shorter one that is
plastic. Are you suggesting that I cut the short plastic one? It seems like
with the longer one in place, there is probably a couple gallons at the
bottom that you can never get to. Should I shorten this one too? IT is over
two inches long...
