&gt; My last cable broke inside the bowden tube. I had a terrible time removing it:

Yow!  That did not look fun!

&gt; &gt;Further examination showed a plastic sleeve pressed into the front (FIF)
&gt; &gt;end of the bowden tube that extended into the clutch tube under the bus.
&gt; &gt;The inner diameter of that tube was distorted so that the threaded end of
&gt; &gt;the cable got caught in the sleeve and could only be dislodged through
&gt; &gt;considerable force.  The sleeve was a tight press fit in the inside of the
&gt; &gt;Bowden tube, but I finally twisted it out.  The sleeve extended only two
&gt; &gt;inches (tightly) into the Bowden tube, but extended about a foot (loosely)
&gt; &gt;into the metal tube under the bus.
&gt;
&gt; The older bowden tubes seem to have a plastic nose. The newer ones from Gemo are metal:

Hmmm, mine has a metal nose, but the sleeve I was referring to went into
the other end (lower left in your photo)  I've never seen a picture of a
bowden tube with such a sleeve attached.

&gt; &gt;I'd like to poll the group wisdom on the sleeve I removed.  It might be a
&gt; &gt;modification from a PO or it might be leftover part of an old cable.  If
&gt; &gt;it's truly something that should be there I will replace it, but things
&gt; &gt;seem to work smoothly without it.
&gt;
&gt; Could be. There is a plastic sleeve inside the entire length of the bowden tube for the cable to ride on.

Now I didn't think of that.  I don't recall any such sleeve in the long
metal tube under the bus.  OTOH, I didn't look all that closely.

Considering how straight the shot is through the tube, I don't see how
there would be much friction there.  Most of the rubbing would be in the
flexible bowden tube.

I should have shot some photos, but I really didn't want to give my
digicam a grease job...
