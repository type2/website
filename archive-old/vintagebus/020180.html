There's a certain perverted glee to asking for a part you know they don't have.
I love to ask the guys _at_ Kragen for a price check on a 911 water pump, or 
muffler bearings, when I'm in there to buy oil. (and oil is about the only 
thing I get at kragen/pep boys/etc)  I let one guy waste 5 who minutes looking
for a muffler bearing; I told him it was for a Porsche, but it was also the same
as a VW.
