Stephen is wondering........

 &lt;&lt; Small Nut / Large Nut has NOTHING to do 
with Transmission!  Although people  say &quot;small 
nut tranny&quot; they are really talking about the Axles
 / Reduction boxes.   --- Correct? &gt;&gt;

Correct.  Even though there were differences when
the transaxles (and Type2s were first sold) now 
there have been numerous owners and trans swaps 
since then so there is no telling what you have until 
you take a look,
 
&lt;&lt; The center section is the &quot;split case&quot; part -- 
Correct?&gt;&gt;

Yes, however, the split case ended in '59 and the 
tunnel type started in '60

&lt;&lt; Is the change from  &quot;split case&quot; to &quot;tunnel&quot; the 
same as the Reduction box change?  Or am I
 confused on center sections (yes) ? &gt;&gt;

Yes.  Barndoor is barndoor. Later split case and 
pre-'63s were one style (small nut).  Post '64-'67 
were the larger 46mm nut style. 
 
&lt;&lt; Small Nut is '63 and down, Large Nut is '64 - '67.  
Small nut has smaller  brakes and uses 1.39 ratio 
reduction boxes.   Large nut has 1.26 ratio.&gt;&gt;

For the most part yes.  There were some redux ratio
options for the pre-63's but they are somewhat rare.
AFAIK you could only get the post-'64 in the 1.26
ratio here in the States.
 
&lt;&lt;You can put the center section of a '64 - '67 on a 
'63 and down?  What the  heck is the difference, if 
any?&gt;&gt;

Yes, you can.  Mainly internal improvements.  I only
use the post-'65 1st and 2nd gears for example.  Later
Swingaxles came with O-ringed sidecovers and I try
and use those as well.  So on and so forth.  A good
general rule of thumb is the later the better.  There are
some exceptions though!
 
 &lt;&lt;There are differences in how the front (FIF) of the 
tranny mounts to the  body and connects to the shifter 
linkage? &gt;&gt;

I don't think so but......

&lt;&lt; Can anyone summarize these  differences 
(relative to year to year)?&gt;&gt;

I sure can't!!
 
 ===============
 
&lt;&lt; I have a '63 that needs the center section replaced.  
I'm locating a core to  have rebuilt and then put in, I 
just want to know what I should be looking  for in a 
core.  Can I use any year from '67 on back, or do I 
need to stick  to a '63 and down center section? &gt;&gt;

Since you will get your trans from me then just get
the core from me as well.  I can mix and match to get
the best of the late style and the 36mm reduction gear
box assy. that you'll need.  
 
&lt;&lt; Todd Hill (Olympia Washington) and I have been 
going over options to raise the top speed for long trips.  
I'd like to be able to cruise 65MPH for  hundreds of 
miles..&gt;&gt;

No problem!!
 
&lt;&lt; Todd described how he could sell me a tranny 
where he takes various gears and parts from various 
center sections and arrives at what he describes as 
 ____&quot; a Type 1 center section with a 3.875 and a 
.82 4th set up for Redux  box Bus &quot;____.&gt;&gt;

See above for your &quot;what do I look for in a core??&quot;
question. 
 
&lt;&lt; It wasn't until I went over this again this morning 
hat I caught that he  was saying a &quot;type 1 center 
section&quot;.  Does that mean I should not really
 worry about locating a correct core for a center 
section, it just comes down  the $ to work out on 
core charge with purchase?&gt;&gt;

Thats correct.  The earlier reduction gear box trans
used a variation on the Type 1 center section.  Very
similar to the Beetles but with a different 3rd and 4th
ratio.  I will machine down some splines on the late 
3.875 Type 1 ring and pinion to accept the early 1.217
3rd gear from a Split window Bus.  Then I will get a 
.82 ratio 4th from a 002 IRS Type 2 transaxle to round
out the build.  This is the same ratio as the earlier Split
but it is splined to mate with the 3.875 ring and pinion
instead of being retained by a key like the earlier 'stock'
Type 2 ring and pinion. (4.125 or 4.375)
