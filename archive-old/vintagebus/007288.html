&gt; I have noticed that the new fuel filter does NOT stay full of gas.  When I
turn the engine off, all the gas runs out of the filter back into the line,
and when it's running the fuel only &gt;comes up about 1/3 of the way into the
filter. To me, this seems like it AIN'T QUITE RIGHT. The old filter stayed
full always

I have noticed the same thing, perhaps it's because you're a sucker. Pulling
a vacuum on the filter would cause vapor to form, as would high temps.
Doesn't matter as long as the float chamber in the carb is staying full.
