My  book states: Starting Mar. 1 1955  Chas # 20-117902  U.S.  model
semaphores replaced with flashing indicators. Starting Jun. 1 1960  Chas #
614456  non U.S. models now with flashing indicators instead of semaphores.
I did some checking for the vw howard trivia contest and this was the
answers I had. Thought it was to easy so ditched it and replaced it with
another, maybe I should have left it in.  Hope to see you in Havasu Jan.
