Subject: Li'l Red's electrical glitches

Even though the main VW in this post is a 74 Super Beetle, the information
is still pertinent to members of the vintagebus listserv, therefore this
message is being crossposted.

Tomorrow I'm departing for Colorado for the RMMW/Bandimere VW Shows.  I'm
carvanning with Rob and Justin Laffoon of Omaha in our 70's Super Beetles
for 40 miles at which time we'll reluctantly park out dubs for a Chevy
compact rental car.  I really was looking forward to doing this trip in the
dubs but I don't have the money or time available in case of breakdowns.

Anyway, tonight my brain gave me a reward by suddenly remembering the
electrical glitches Li'l Red has plagued me with in the past and how I fixed
them.  One thought led to another and I remembered Dan Kinsey (vw bus nut
from KCMO now in Florida) using a Dremel tool with the long snake
attatchment and wire wheel bit to clean up electrical parts and especially
light sockets.  TOSS THAT EMORY CLOTH AND SANDPAPER AWAY - this dremel tool
idea not only speeds up the task, it shines up the terminals to a new,
clean, and quality shine/luster.

So to turn this all into something that makes sense,  I put 2 and 2 together
and figured I'd pull the fuses and clean the fuse tips and terminal ends.
There was evidence of slight moisture corruption in the bottom of the
plastic fuse cover.  I had correctly remembered that due to corroded fuse
terminals about a year and a half ago, I had the same symptoms of
intermittant alternator light coming on followed by a gas guage that
suddenly said I had half a gallon of gas left.  As if that weren't enough,
my frustration was egged on by a lack of turn signal operation then and now.
All of these things failing at once and becoming increasingly intermittant
led me to believe I had something other than a bad alternator.

Cleaning the fuses and terminals solved the problem so I also cleaned the
terminals on the alternator the same way and put a little grease on them.  I
didn't grease the fuse terminals because I don't like toting grease around
inside the dubs.  Anyone know of a good product to use to prevent corrosion
of these terminals that is as non-mess as you can get?  Now I wonder what
the condition of the terminals are on the back side of the fuse block?  I
will have to pull the block and check.  I think I'd feel a lot better if I
could pull all the wires off - one at a time of course, and
cleaning/protecting them all the same way.

The throbbing light system still persists however, it's pattern has changed:
At idle, my lights inside and out are steady.  It used to pulsate at all
speeds.  The minute I give it gas and increase the alternator speed, it
fluctuates rather noticeably but once steady speed is maintained, the lights
stabilize inside and out.  This sounds to me like a regulator problem of
some sort.  Maybe I just need to go around and clean ALL the terminals and
sockets making sure to protect them as I go.

The moral of the story is that no matter what air-cooled VW you drive, you
gotta have those terminal connections clean for things to work properly.
