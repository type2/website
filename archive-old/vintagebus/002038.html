It's only a 1/2&quot; drive, but JCW sells a 36mm six point deep impact socket
for $7.19.
I had no trouble removing the rear axle nut from my 181 with it, a breaker
bar, and a cheater pipe.
I have heard of people breaking the 1/2&quot; breaker bars though.  Mine's
Craftsman so I can return it if it breaks.
Mike
