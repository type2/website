Subject: RE: [VB] throwout bearing install...



&gt; From: rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com [mailto:rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com]
&gt;
&gt; I'm swapping a throwout bearing. The clips seem to leave the throwout
&gt; bearing with a little play front to back when it's mounted. I tried
&gt; crimping them tight a bit, but it's the little hook the clips have that hit
&gt; at the back that seems to keep them from getting any tighter. Almost like
&gt; they're a tad long there or something.

Early throwout bearing, right?

The place where the bearing rides on the throwout fork tends to wear,
which makes the springs loose.  If this is the case, you need to replace
the throwout fork with a new one.  What usually happens is that one of the
ends of the fork finally fractures and the bearing falls onto the input
shaft.  Good thing you caught it.

I also safety wire the springs in place.  Run thin stainless safety wire
through the holes in the spring clips and around the groove in the outer
race of the bearing.
