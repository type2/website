Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning intake manifold



&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of cleaning intake manifold heat risers - do you often
&gt;&gt;&gt; find that one heat riser is more plugged than the other?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Which side does the exhaust come in? (I forget)
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what you mean here.  I thought it came in on both sides.



Nope. On a 1600, it comes in from the passenger side and exits on the
drivers side. If I remember correctly, other mufflers had other
arrangements (mebbe the fresh vs stale-air 40hps?).
The gaskets tell the tale: the gasket with a LARGE hole goes on the
heatriser leg that lets IN the exhaust gasses... in the 1600 case, the
right (FIF) side; the gasket with the SMALL hole goes on the 'exit' side -
this creates backpressure  designed to &quot;hold&quot; the warm gasses in the riser
to better enable the heat to warm the carb.

Inlet side cokes up first.
