i was completely under the driver's side of the bus.  i can attest that it
is not a vehicle that makes breathing easy when you're being compacted by
it.

&gt; &gt;the inertia from the accident caused the bus to turn 90 degrees and flip
&gt; over-LANDING ON TOP OF ME. i was pinned/trapped under the bus until the
&gt; crowd of people around realized i was under it and lifted it off of me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; What part of you was pinned?  Your legs or were you entirely underneath
&gt; the side of the Bus?
