Subject: Re: [VB] Big tires on a pickup


I'm running 215/15 rears and 195/14 fronts on both my busses.  Does have a
tilt, which I think changes the camber enough to notice it in the
steering.  My 58 has always steered very nice until I did this.  Although
it's not bad it is noticeable that it's a little touchier.

&gt; &lt;&lt; What are the drawbacks to having 15 inch tires on the rear wheels of a big
&gt;  stub (1965) pickup? I bought it that way and I don't know if I should change
&gt;  them back to 14 inch or leave them alone. The fronts have 14 inch tires.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; I'd say the main drawback is that your spare tire is not the same as what's
&gt; under all corners of the truck.   Though the 65 came with 14s all around,
&gt; maybe a PO wanted a little more road speed.
&gt; FWIW my 61 has the big stub/nut RGBs with 15&quot;s on the back.    Actually it
&gt; has 14&quot;s on the front right now (till I get the 15&quot; rims powder coated and
&gt; new tires), which makes the speedo read higher than it really goes, and the
&gt; bus has that tilted nose dive look.
