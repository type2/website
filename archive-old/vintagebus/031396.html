The Arizona Bus Club sends out a BIG BUS thank-you to all or you who came through to
complete this Raffle bus--The End IS in sight--Please send A LOT of thanks to Kyle at
&quot;Tillman, Kyle&quot; &lt;cal4570_at_qwest_dot_net&gt; and Jon at &quot;Stanton, Jon &quot; &lt;JDStanton5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;   The
hours that the two of them have put into this bus, Plus Debbie Stanton, is the reason
there IS a bus to Raffle off--and Jim in Yuma for Another motor!!  But truly the unsung
hero is Kyle  who for years has donated his time--money--and back yard to complete this
project--Again it will be Kyle doing the interior--Hopefully in the next year we can come
up with more volunteers to get this Bus done--I know i have been out there begging for bus
stuff--But this bus will be a part of a lot of people --thanks to a ALL of you-- Please
keep in touch--We are almost there!! and do not forget--for just .50 cents--you can WIN
this bus!! But you gotta be there!! See all of you Sep 15 - 16-- and the Jerome Sparklee
will be Given away again--You cannot buy them--they are always free!!
