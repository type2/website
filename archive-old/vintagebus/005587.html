See, that's the thing. According to the owner of the '66 in question all he
got was phone calls from people asking all kinds of questions and then when
it came to the closing arguments they'd start going off about price, lack of
founds etc., etc.,etc. Some even wanted him to finance. Some wanted him to
fix the bus so it was drivable. In my opinion, some were not buyers at all.

&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; People are cheep.  Bus people seem to be especially so.
&gt;    &gt;&gt;
&gt;  I'm pretty cheap, but to have floors and rockers in a bus is worth $400
to
&gt; me. I dont weld, so it would cost far more to have it properly repaired.
&gt;      I also dont understand bitching to the owner about a price, If you
dont
&gt; like the number, and its not flexible, dont buy it. 9 out of 10 some one
else
&gt; will.
