Subject: Ebay Scam alert, BEWARE!

Hey Y'all,
As an addendum to my previous posts regarding buying
welders for doing bus body work, I want to add this:
DO NOT EVER BUY A WELDER FROM EBAY!! (unless it is
used and being offered from a PRIVATE seller)
I was all set to buy one there, it was the size I
wanted, the Buy it Now price seemed reasonable (I
thought) and I found an Ebay seller offering FREE
SHIPPING.  Well, luckily before I bought it, I did
some investigating and asked the seller a few key
questions. The seller said that the welder would be
&quot;drop shipped&quot; from a company called Harbor Freight. 
So just for fun I went to see if Harbor Freight had a
website. Sure enough they did, and there was the same
welder for $35 dollars cheaper than the ebay seller
and guess what?! Harbor Freight offers FREE SHIPPING
on any order over $50.  So this guy was selling
welders he didn't have, and when he got paid by the
buyer he would then buy the welder from Harbor Freight
and have it delivered to the buyer and keep the marked
up profit! And this seller has over 1000 feddback
rating with 99.6% positive feedback!!  So, I went back
to Ebay and searched again for mig welders and found
at least 2 other sellers doing the exact same thing!! 
One guy was selling a Lincoln 135 mig welder for $429,
this is one I almost bought, and I noticed that his
description read &quot;shipped directly from Indiana Oxygen
Company&quot;. So armed with my new-found knowledge, I go
find Indiana Oxygen Company web site, find their phone
number and call them, and they sell the same welder
for $378!!!
Moral of the story is, when buying a welder DO NOT
look on Ebay. And if you do, ask the seller where it
will be shipped from then goto that company and buy it
direct. Or do as I did, and go to the local Home
Improvement warehouse and charge it!! 
I am glad I discovered this scam before I bought
anything, and I hope this advice helps others who may
be looking to buy a welder for their bus\bug\whatever!
