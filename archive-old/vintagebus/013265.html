Over the past few weeks, I have had to do more and more manual
administration due to users being over their mail quotas.  This
is due to using bush-league ISP's who are big on the number of
users, and not big on providing a high level or service or
usage to each of those users.  Examples of these ISP's are
AOL and webtv.

If you're going to use one of these accounts, either check your
mail on a more frequent basis, switch ISP's, or unsubscribe when
you are going to be email-less for a period of time.

When the arbitrary quota, which is set by your ISP and not me, is
reached, each message sent to the list is bounced to me.  I then
have to go in and remove you manually to prevent overloading my
mailbox.  I don't have any other way to process these cases.

If the low volume of the vintagebus list is exceeding your
mail quota, then you need a new ISP!

Thank you.

Thom
