If anyone gives the guy a grand for a rolled, incomplete, hole riddled, bondo
packed, master cylinder failing, interior wanting 66 needing a complete brake
job tI want to talk to you.  I've got a nice piece of swamp...uh I mean coastal
property I think you'd be interested in.  Lets get real people.  The only
way to bring prices back to reality is to NOT overpay for garbage.  Buy it YES,
but as a realistic price.

Sounds like a 300...maybe 500 dollar bus.  That said, I didn't look at
it...maybe its the perfect money pit for someone out there.

The bus Greg sold was nicer and sold for less.  BTW Jason, this is no
reflection on you....not killing the messenger ya know.

&gt; .
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He wants 1200. I think he'd take 1000.
