Hi Jdd,
First check your shift linkage, and tranny mounts.  Then try changing tranny 
oil if you have not already in the last 20,000 miles.  Then try the bungee 
cord.  Anyway you do it you really should have at least $600.00 at all times 
in savings so if something goes wrong you can cover most of a newly rebuilt 
engine or tranny.   Eric&amp;Barb
