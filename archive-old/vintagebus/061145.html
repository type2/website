&gt; I've been greasing adjusting stars and the holders they spin in for enough
&gt; years that I've had to redo worn brakes and then I find everything still
&gt; spins nice.   I dab a little grease on the shoes where they slide into the
&gt; star thingys too.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, not so many people realise how good grease is.  Only one bus
&gt; I've looked at brakes on that I hadn't looked at before had its stars
&gt; greased.  very sad :(

You haven't looked at my bus!

&gt; I use grease from the pot I fill from overflow from greasing the front
&gt; suspension. slightly used.

I use anti-sieze on the stars.  This is exactly what anti-sieze was
designed to do, prevent non-moving threaded parts from rusting and
otherwise locking up.
