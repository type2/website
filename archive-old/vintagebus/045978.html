On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend there are head to head SOTO-NEATO
events in Sacramento.  Last year, my Dad and I went to the NEATO show first,
looked at busses, spent money at the swap, bugged Dean Anderson for a
Sacramento Samba Society T-shirt (the NEATO chapter) bought raffle tickets
and was invited to eat with some fellow bus owners.  My Dad wanted to check
out the Ancil Hoffman meet so we cruised over there.  There were four busses
at Ancil Hoffman.  Four.  Maybe there were some there earlier, but I could
never find anyone who would admit to it.
BTW: The NEATO chapter, Sacramento Samba Society, are the same guys who used
to be the Sacramento SOTO chapter that hosted the Ancil Hoffman picnic.

Just my observations
