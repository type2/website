&gt;Who is competent to repair semaphores?  Mine need new solenoids.

I don't know of anyplace offhand that fixes them but you might ask
at a shop that fixes electric guitars.  They rewind pick-ups and so
might have the wire and machinery to re-wind the semaphore coil.  To
make it work right the wire gauge and number of turns have to be the
same or very very close. 

A friend of mine claims he re-wound his own, but he is also a
commercial electronics tech and ham from wayback, so he's probably
got more experience than most of us.
