Hi gang:

Couple of questions on Westy jalousies.  I'm talking specifically about
the ones with three adjustable panes of glass and one smaller fixed pane
at the top, although if anything from other types (eg, single-pane
EZ-camper windows) might apply, please advise.

1) Anyone keeping track of design variations on these?  I yanked some
from (IIRC) a '67 in a junkyard a few months ago, and removed them by
simply pushing them out of the body.  No other mounting that I could
see; looks like they're just held in by the caulk and interference fit. 
How else might they be mounted?

2) What's done on the inside?  A wood frame or something?

3) Any sources/ideas for replacing the perishable components (plastic
grey weatherstripping pieces at top, bottom and sides of glass area,
inside the frame)?

4) I've seen busses with two jalousies per side (last window stationary
or popout) and with three per side.  Any rhyme or reason?

I've got mine looking pretty good via wirebrushing and clearcoating. 
Not shiny like ellis's, but more like brushed aluminum.  They're going
into the '65 Neunsitzer at least for a while (popouts are pretty rusty
and of course their rubber is long-gong).

Thanks!
Joe
