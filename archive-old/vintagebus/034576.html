&lt;&lt; Please could you guys suggest an anal and painstaking run in
 procedure.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Fill with 20WT (In winter with temps below 50F use 10WT.) or 30WT if that is 
all you can find, or weather is over 100F.  Run engine at about 2,000 RPM for 
15 mintues.  Drain and check for large metal shavings, oil leaks, loose fan 
belt, or other problems.  Replace with 30WT (Unless the days high temps are 
30For less, then 20WT) and proceed to drive in town stop and go traffic for 
15-30 minutes here and there giving it at least 15 minutes between runs to 
cool down.  Check oil often, after 300 miles change engine oil, remove rocker 
arms, retorque heads, and fully tune up the engine.
