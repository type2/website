If you really want to see a really clean IRS bus conversion come to BBB V
and see Matts 60 DD conversion. This conversion used the 68 type 2 trailing
arms and components. I was told by someone that the 68 only type 2 spring
plates will fit right on a split, the only thing you need to do is weld in
the pivot points for the arms. This was done by cutting into the forks and
boxing them in at the torsion housing, then weld in the pivots in the boxed
sections. His bus rides at stock height and now has the options of numerous
transmission and gear choices, also the strength of the late bay suspension.
If I get his bus back up on the hoist in the shop I will photograph this
conversion and post it somewhere on the net.

Sounds like most people here are against running a swingaxle kit. I do
like the look of the stock height bus. I am concerned about being able
to find a good priced, reliable freeway flyer tranny. A freind of mine
that has ran a vw repair shop here for the last 20 years says that he
doesn't order trannys for customers anymore because he was replacing one
out of every four, using a couple of different well known companies. A
local tranny rebuilder that he has used lately( with about the same
results) told me that he would rebuild my tranny with a higher ring and
pinion for $450 which is about how much it would cost me total to do the
swing axle conversion, using lowered spindles, with the swing axle kit,
that  I found. I was however under the impression that you could not
just put a higher ring and pinion in the bus tranny. Am I wrong about
that? The other companies that I have priced are more like 6-8 hundred.
Also I wanted to know if I would have to change the tire I am using
(205/75 r14) if I only lowered the bus the 3 1/2 inches that the the
redux boxes raise the bus. Wouldn't this take the bus to the height of a
stock bug, and they run  15&quot; rims. I would not want to change my tires;
they were pretty expensive. I guess I am still not sure which would be
better suited for us. All of the info on what is involved part wise to
build a freeway flyer that I have read has been kind of conflicting.
What is really involved in building one may be useful in determining
whether I want to have it built locally. Thank you for the responses.
